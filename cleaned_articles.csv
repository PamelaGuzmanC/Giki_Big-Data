CNBC,https://www.cnbc.com/2024/06/30/democrats-defend-biden-debate-flop-voter-poll.html,2024-06-30,16:58:10 UTC,'Preparation overload': Democrats defend Biden after debate flop as voter support flinches,"Democrat candidate, U.S. President Joe Biden, and Republican candidate, former U.S. President Donald Trump, attend a presidential debate in Atlanta, Georgia, U.S., June 27, 2024.

Democrats are making the rounds on the Sunday media circuit working to reshape perceptions about President Joe Biden after he delivered a stumbling debate performance that left his voters cringing and his party in a damage-control frenzy.

""Yes, it was a bad performance,"" South Carolina's Democratic Rep. Jim Clyburn, a close Biden ally, said on CNN's ""State of the Union."" ""I know when I see what I call preparation overload. And that's exactly what was going on the other night.""

The South Carolina Democrat followed the post-debate spin formula that has emerged from Biden supporters since the Thursday showdown: Acknowledge the fumble and then pivot to critiques of the presumptive Republican presidential nominee, former President Donald Trump.

""Joe Biden should continue to run on his record. I do believe that we will find him when contrasted with the record of the four years of Trump to be exactly what we need going forward,"" Clyburn said.

Former presidents Barack Obama and Bill Clinton followed that structure in similar arguments on Friday.

House Democratic Leader Hakeem Jeffries, Sen. Chris Coons, D-Del., Sen. Raphael Warnock, D-Ga. and former House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., also jumped to Biden's defense on the Sunday media junket.

Despite the full-court press, Biden's Thursday debate performance, marked by several instances where he tripped over his words or trailed off mid-answer, has only amplified voter concerns about his age and fitness to carry out a second presidential term.

A new CBS News/YouGov poll taken between June 28 and June 29 found that 72% of registered voters surveyed do not think Biden should run for president, up from 63% in February. The poll also found that 72% of the respondents do not think that Biden has the mental and cognitive ability to serve as president, a seven percent increase since June 9.

A poll taken so shortly after a major event like Thursday's debate represents a knee-jerk reaction. A more accurate snapshot of public sentiment may emerge as the initial hype dies down and voters have more time to process. The CBS News poll surveyed 1,130 registered voters and had a margin of error of +/- 4.2%.

But those new numbers come in direct tension with Biden's argument that voters are not as down on his debate blunders as much as political pundits.

""I understand the concern about the debate. I get it. I didn't have a great night. But here's what [is] not getting reported: Voters had a different reaction than the pundits,"" the president said at a Saturday campaign event in East Hampton, N.Y. ""Since the debate, polls show a little movement, and we've moved us up, actually.""

Biden and Trump are scheduled for a second debate on Sept. 10, though it is unclear whether both candidates will follow through.

Ultimately, the debate has triggered a Democratic reckoning over whether Biden should remain the presumptive nominee.

Some Democratic strategists, along with newspaper editorial boards across the country have suggested he should step down and forfeit his delegates ahead of August's Democratic National Convention to allow someone else to take on Trump in November.

Biden is at Camp David on Sunday, joined by his family where he is expected to discuss the path forward of his reelection bid, according to NBC News.

In the meantime, the Biden campaign has been raking in large fundraising hauls in the wake of the debate. As of Sunday morning, the campaign had raised $33 million since Thursday, $26 million of which came from grassroots donors, according to Biden campaign spokesperson Kevin Munoz.

Munoz added that nearly half of that grassroots funding came from donors giving money to the campaign for the first time this election season.","Democrat candidate, U.S. President Joe Biden, and Republican candidate, former U.S. President Donald Trump, attend a presidential debate in Atlanta, Georgia, U.S., June 27, 2024.

Former Presidents Barack Obama and Bill Clinton on Friday tried to do some damage control following President Joe Biden's debate fumble against his November election opponent, former President Donald Trump.

""Bad debate nights happen. Trust me, I know. But this election is still a choice between someone who has fought for ordinary folks his entire life and someone who only cares about himself,"" Obama said in a post on X, linking to Biden's campaign website. ""Last night didn't change that, and it's why so much is at stake in November.""

Several hours later, Clinton mimicked the defensive play.

""I'll leave the debate rating to the pundits, but here's what I know: facts and history matter,"" Clinton said in his own post on X, following with a brief list of Biden's accomplishments.

Throughout the 90-minute showdown on Thursday, Biden regularly stumbled, taking mid-sentence pauses to gather his words and tripping over his sentences. The blunders happened even on topics like abortion and the economy, which he tends to be cogent on during campaign rallies and White House events.

The messaging from Obama and Clinton marks a shift in strategy for Democrats as they try to course-correct after Thursday's flop.

Much of Democrats' spin immediately following the debate attempted to play down Biden's conspicuous blunders, instead attacking Trump's performance and giving Biden a generous evaluation.

""As the night went on, I think [Biden] really kind of rose to the occasion,"" Biden co-campaign chair Mitch Landrieu told NBC News Thursday night after the debate. ""I'm proud of the fact that he stood up to Donald Trump.""

The comments from Obama and Clinton represent a new tact: Acknowledge the debate disaster and then tell the public not to focus on it.

Biden himself followed that framing on Friday during a rally in North Carolina: ""Folks, I don't walk as easily as I used to. I don't speak as smoothly as I used to. I don't debate as well as I used to. But I know what I do know: I know how to tell the truth.""

But debates do matter to voters. After the September 2020 debate, a slew of polls found that voters thought Biden did a better job, which helped him maintain his lead against Trump.

This year's presidential race has been a near dead-heat so far and will likely be won by tight margins come November, leaving little room for error.

In the days since the debate, Democrats have been concerned about how it might weigh on voter perceptions, which are already rife with worries about Biden's age and fitness to lead the country for another four years.

Some Democratic strategists, donors and pundits have already suggested that Biden should drop out of the race and reopen the Democratic field to potentially stronger candidates.

The Biden campaign has so far rejected that proposal. Biden and Trump are scheduled to face off at a second and final debate on Sept. 10.","Former Presidents Barack Obama and Bill Clinton on Friday tried to do some damage control following President Joe Biden's debate fumble against his November election opponent, former President Donald Trump.

Pride month is winding down — and this year, the corporate world took a more cautious approach. June tends to bring a wave of rainbow-themed merchandise and affirming ads and social media posts from retailers and consumers brands, coinciding with parades and other events that celebrate the LGBTQ+ community. As the presidential election approaches, however, some companies have grown quieter about diversity, equity and inclusion efforts to avoid stepping into the culture wars or facing the blowback from conservative customers that Target and Bud Light did a year ago. The starkest example of that came late Thursday: Tractor Supply, a retailer that sells animal feed, cowboy boots and lawn supplies in rural parts of the country, said it is ending all spending tied to diversity and environmental causes. That includes no longer sponsoring Pride festivals, the statement said. The move, while an outlier in its magnitude, underscores how some companies that made inclusion commitments in recent years are treading cautiously. It is difficult to track how many companies shared supportive messages, donated to LGBTQ+ causes or sold rainbow-themed merchandise in June compared to previous years. According to Gravity Research, a Washington, D.C.-based reputational research firm, 45% of Fortune 100 companies had at least one social media post on LinkedIn or X explicitly related to Pride as of June 21 this year, compared with 51% last June. Gravity Research President Luke Hartig said the volatility of the presidential election and the two candidates' willingness to call out companies by name has also made companies less likely to go public about their stand. ""There's a little bit of like, 'keep our heads down while we go through this election,'"" he said. Tim Bennett, cofounder of Tribury Productions, a marketing company that specializes in reaching LGBTQ+ Americans, works with Fortune 500 companies, including recent projects with Procter & Gamble. He said more clients have taken ""a wait-and-see"" approach to marketing to LGBTQ+ consumers or decided to scatter efforts throughout the year instead of making a big splash in a single month. ""June this year has not been like the last five or six,"" Bennett said. That may not be a bad thing for LGBTQ+ initiatives and charities. Sarah Kate Ellis, CEO of nonprofit advocacy group GLAAD, said she's seeing more companies get involved with year-round philanthropy and activism in more meaningful ways. She also pointed to a survey by Gravity Research that found that 78% of companies did not plan to change their Pride strategy this year. Thirteen percent were unsure whether they'd make changes and 9% said they planned to revise their strategy. Gravity Research surveyed 45 corporate executives and Fortune 500 leaders across industries in April. ""The visibility of companies putting flags out and having product to celebrate our Pride and to mark a month that's really significant and important for our community is really important, and I don't want to ever devalue that,"" Ellis said. ""I do think, though, those companies must look inside and make sure that they have the policies and the HR practices that match their outward marketing."" Major companies are still writing checks for LGBTQ+ causes, too. A GLAAD spokesperson said Friday that the group has not seen donations or corporate support decline this Pride month, though it does not yet have a total tally. On Friday, when the Stonewall National Monument Visitor Center officially opened its doors to commemorate the New York City bar that was a catalyst in the LGBTQ+ rights movement, the event had major backing from the business community. Supporters included Google, Amazon, JPMorgan Chase and Booking.com. President Joe Biden also made an appearance and remarks at the monument's opening.

The Bud Light and Target effect

Consumer staples brands were the most likely to say they planned to shift their Pride month strategy this year, according to Gravity Research's survey. That may stem from the conservative boycotts of Target and Bud Light last year. Target has carried a Pride collection for over a decade. Yet last year, the big-box retailer removed some items and moved displays after employees faced threats. Boycotters targeted items for transgender shoppers, such as ""tuck-friendly"" swimsuits, and also criticized separate Pride merchandise for kids. Instead of putting Pride merchandise in all stores this year, Target only carried it in the locations that accounted for 90% of total Pride sales in 2022 and 2023. It also stopped selling any Pride apparel for kids. On the company's website and in those select stores, shoppers can find a wide variety of Pride-themed items. The volume of negative feedback to the Pride collection externally and internally is ""significantly lower"" this year than in 2023, according to a Target spokesperson. In a statement, Target said it is ""committed to supporting the LGBTQIA+ community during Pride Month and year-round"" and would participate in Pride events across the country and support LGBTQ+ groups, in addition to offering Pride products.

Anheuser-Busch InBev and other large beer brands, on the other hand, have backed away from public support of the LGBTQ+ community. Conservatives like singer Kid Rock and Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis called for a boycott of the beer and its parent company, Anheuser-Busch InBev, after Bud Light sent personalized cans of its beer to transgender influencer Dylan Mulvaney. The marketing campaign coincided with the March Madness college basketball tournament. Bud Light sales tumbled around 25%, and the brand lost its spot as the best-selling beer in the U.S., ceding the position it held for more than two decades to Constellation Brands' Modelo. AB InBev distanced itself from Mulvaney and fired Bud Light's vice president of marketing. In October, AB InBev CEO Michel Doukeris said the brand would focus its marketing more on events like sports games and concerts. It also returned as the official sponsor of the UFC. In recent months, some consumers have returned to Bud Light, as RBC Europe analysts estimate that the brand's U.S. volume is down only about 10% these days. For its part, Bud Light hasn't posted in support of Pride month on its Instagram or X pages this year. The boycott was unusually sticky for a few reasons, according to Neil Reid, a geography professor at the University of Toledo who researches the beer industry. Studies have shown that consumers' loyalty to top-selling beers may be more tied to the brand than the taste, Reid said. Right-wing news outlets like Fox News also devoted plenty of airtime to the controversy, stretching its duration and potentially reaching new consumers who missed the initial reaction. Plus, once Bud Light sales fell, retailers gave more shelf space to its rivals. ""You can look at this issue from a moral, ethical perspective or you can also look at it from a pure business perspective. Those two often don't result in the same strategy,"" Reid said.

Marco Bello | Reuters

President Joe Biden's raspy, unfocused, often inarticulate and widely panned debate performance stoked deep anxiety among Democrats — and caused some commentators and fundraisers to openly call for a new nominee to run against former President Donald Trump. But replacing Biden as the party's pick less than five months out from Election Day carries enormous political risks and would be difficult, if not impossible, to pull off. Right now, the only likely way Biden could be replaced is if he willingly ends his campaign. And Biden's aides and top Democratic officials say the 81-year-old incumbent has no plans to do so. If he did drop out, Democrats have yet to identify a clear alternative candidate to swap in. But the panic among donors and party officials after watching Biden falter Thursday night in his debate against Trump has led some of them to take steps to get Biden out of the race. There are already discussions among Democratic fundraisers about trying to convince congressional leaders — Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer in particular — to urge Biden to announce to drop out, according to people familiar with the matter who were granted anonymity to speak freely.

Saul Loeb | AFP | Getty Images

Schumer, D-N.Y., is a top target for donors making that pitch because he privately has voiced concerns about Biden's standings in presidential election polls, those people said. Schumer was worried before the debate that Biden and Trump were statistically tied nationally, despite the Republican challenger's conviction in his New York criminal hush money trial. A spokesman for Schumer declined to comment to CNBC but pointed to a social media post the majority leader published after the debate. Schumer in that X post wrote: ""Tonight's debate made the choice clear: Four more years of progress, or four more years of attacks on our fundamental rights and our democracy."" ""We've got to get out the vote for Joe Biden, Kamala Harris, and a Democratic Senate and House!"" the post said. That spin has not alleviated the post-debate anxiety felt by some of the president's top fundraisers. Some of those wealthy donors have lost trust in Biden's team, believing they were given false assurances about Biden's ability to take on Trump. And some of those donors who already planned to attend a high-dollar fundraiser Saturday in the Hamptons section of Long Island say they will attend the event to judge for themselves whether Biden can continue as a viable candidate. ""Democrats are in a very difficult situation because it's late in the campaign for a change,"" said Meena Bose, director of the Peter S. Kalikow Center for the Study of the American Presidency at Hofstra University, in an interview with CNBC. The only feasible way Bose could see it playing out is with Biden throwing his full support behind Vice President Kamala Harris to become the new nominee.

Otherwise, Democrats have a wide-open nomination fight just a few months before the Nov. 5 election, she said. Bose called that a ""disastrous"" prospect."" ""Vice President Harris is a risky choice, but certainly has the visibility and is the logical choice,"" said Bose. ""It's difficult to see how you open up the Democratic presidential nomination now and have a unified path to victory in November,"" she added.

However, even if Biden backed Harris to replace him ahead of the Democratic National Convention in August, there is no guarantee that the delegates he has won so far will shift their support to her. Biden has won nearly all of the roughly 4,000 Democratic-pledged delegates, far exceeding the threshold to make him the party nominee. If Biden refuses to drop out before August, the only opportunity to boot him as nominee would be at the Democratic National Convention that month. It is technically possible that Biden's delegates could abandon him en masse then and throw open the convention to nominate another candidate. Some Democrats who want an alternative to Biden but are concerned about Harris' relatively low opinion polls and rocky campaign history have looked to California Gov. Gavin Newsom, Ohio Sen. Sherrod Brown, Illinois Gov. J.B. Pritzker and others as possible contenders.

But blocking Biden from the nomination is highly improbable, as delegates tend to be strong supporters of their chosen candidate. ""That is probably the worst-case scenario,"" Bose said. ""If the Democrats are going to have a change at the top of the ticket, President Biden has to endorse it and, frankly, probably initiate it."" The DNC rules allow for the party to select another presidential nominee, but only in the ""event of death, resignation or disability"" that leaves the role vacant.

CNBC,https://www.cnbc.com/2024/06/27/goodrx-tracker-drug-prices-rise.html,2024-06-27,22:10:55 UTC,"Drug prices have risen almost 40% over the past decade, according to a new tracker","The cost of prescription medications in the U.S. has increased 37% since 2014, far surpassing the rate of inflation, according to data from drug savings company GoodRx .

Though the price increases have slowed this year in comparison to the past decade, the higher costs are raising out-of-pocket expenses for consumers. The average American spends $16.26 out of pocket per prescription, according to the data.

""When things increase … inevitably, they do trickle down to consumers, especially those who are in a high deductible plan or who don't have insurance or find themselves paying substantially out of pocket,"" said GoodRx director of research Tori Marsh.

GoodRx said the patients' share of the cost continues to grow due to rising copays, coinsurances and deductibles. The company found that over the past 10 years, the average person's deductible nearly doubled, and copays are rising as the majority of plans are adding another tier of drugs with higher copays.

It is a dynamic GoodRx deems ""the big pinch."" High medication costs are coupled with reduced insurance coverage. Analyzing coverage for more than 3,700 Medicare Part D plans between 2010 and 2024, GoodRx found that the portion of medications covered dropped 19% during that period.

""The impact is really kind of threefold,"" Marsh said. ""Rising costs or rising prices are a big part of it, but it's really that with the combination of increased friction. … It's hard for people to, in some ways, access their medication or access a pharmacy. And then on top of that, insurance is not what it used to be. It's not covering as much as it used to.""

On average, Americans pay two to three times more for prescription drugs than consumers in other developed countries, according to the White House.

Drug costs have become a focus for President Joe Biden, particularly as he approaches the 2024 election. The Biden administration has taken several measures to lower out-of-pocket drug expenses.

On Wednesday, the White House announced it would lower prices on 64 prescription drugs for some Medicare beneficiaries as a result of inflation penalties on drugmakers.

The lower costs, effective during the third quarter, will benefit roughly 750,000 people who use the drugs annually, some of whom could save up to $4,593 per day, according to the release.

""Despite efforts by policymakers and industry leaders to break down affordability and accessibility barriers, a patient's actual out-of-pocket cost continues to increase and is often a huge surprise to them,"" said GoodRx interim CEO Scott Wagner in a news release.

The Biden administration on Wednesday said it will impose inflation penalties on 64 prescription drugs for the third quarter of this year, lowering costs for certain older Americans enrolled in Medicare.

President Joe Biden has made lowering U.S. drug prices a key pillar of his health-care agenda and reelection platform for 2024. A provision of Biden's Inflation Reduction Act requires drugmakers to pay rebates to Medicare, the federal health program for Americans over age 65, if they hike the price of a medication faster than the rate of inflation.

It is separate from another provision under the law that allows Medicare to negotiate lower prescription drug prices with manufacturers. On average, Americans pay two to three times more than patients in other developed nations for prescription drugs, according to the Biden administration.

Some patients will pay a lower coinsurance rate for the 64 drugs covered under Wednesday's announcement, which fall under Medicare Part B, for the period from July 1 to Sept. 30 ""since each drug company raised prices faster than the rate of inflation,"" according to a release from the administration.

Some Medicare Part B patients may save as much as $4,593 per day if they use those drugs during the quarter, the release added.

More than 750,000 Medicare patients use the drugs each year, according to the release. The medications treat conditions such as cancer, certain infections and a bone disease called osteoporosis.

The list includes Bristol Myers Squibb's Abecma, a cell therapy for multiple myeloma; and Pfizer's targeted cancer treatment for certain lymphomas called Adectris. It also includes Astellas Pharma and Pfizer's Padcev, a targeted cancer treatment for advanced bladder cancer.

The Biden administration said Padcev's price has increased faster than inflation every quarter since the Medicare inflation rebate program went into effect last year.","The Biden administration on Wednesday said it will impose inflation penalties on 64 prescription drugs for the third quarter of this year, lowering costs for certain older Americans enrolled in Medicare.

Delta Air Lines is the country's most profitable airline. CEO Ed Bastian's challenge is to make sure his carrier stays on top. The airline's unit revenue, the amount it brings in for every seat it flies one mile, outpaced its competitors' last year. Delta's share price has soared more than 17% in 2024, one of the strongest performers in the rocky airline sector, in a rally that's outdone the S&P 500 's. It expects free cash flow to rise as much as 50% this year to between $3 billion and $4 billion, and is eyeing a return to an investment-grade credit rating. And a stat any traveler would appreciate: Delta came in first in punctuality last year, with more than 83% of its flights arriving on time, according to the Transportation Department. Rival United Airlines — second to Delta in net profit margins — is circling. It says it could grow profit even more this year. ""Knowing that there's someone that thinks that they can take that mantle from us, that keeps us on our toes and keeps us continuing to drive hard,"" Bastian told CNBC.

Delta has fashioned itself as America's premium airline. It has won over hordes of splurging travelers, many of them carrying American Express cards, Delta's cash cow of a partner that generated almost $7 billion for the airline last year. Sales growth of Delta's roomier and more expensive seats continues to outpace revenue from standard coach. As they vie for luxury flyers, both Delta and United have added more high-end seating to their planes to cater to travelers who deem worthwhile a $300 surcharge for a few inches of extra legroom on a cross-country round trip, or 10 times as much for a seat in business class. Bastian, a former auditor who said he took his first flight at age 25 for a business trip (New York to Chicago), is in charge of ensuring Delta lives up to its brand luster. On Wednesday, Delta took its next shot in the battle for high-spending flyers when it opened its newest, highest tier of airport lounge at New York's John F. Kennedy International Airport for passengers in its Delta One cabin, its top cabin that features lie-flat beds for longer flights. At more than 39,000 square feet it is Delta's largest lounge, accented with pillows that have the iconic zigzag motif of Italian fashion house Missoni, its new amenity kit partner. It features complimentary spa treatments, like ice globes and serum for jet-lagged eyes, along with showers, a full restaurant, and a deck overlooking the airfield, in a bet that travelers' desire to treat themselves is here to stay. Delta is taking a page from the playbooks of United and American , which already dedicate their swankiest lounges to customers flying in long-haul business class. Delta plans to open Delta One lounges in Boston and Los Angeles later this year, and is studying airports where it could open others. ""The thing with this industry is no good idea goes uncopied,"" said Raymond James airline analyst Savanthi Syth. Meanwhile, United is placing huge orders for new Boeing and Airbus planes and remodeling hundreds of narrow-body cabins that feature seatback screens and Bluetooth technology, a strategy that aims to cater to travelers from international business class to those flying on the cheapest basic economy tickets. ""We haven't exactly achieved the No. 1 profitability status in the industry, but I know we're on our way,"" United's chief commercial officer, Andrew Nocella, said in an interview last month. ""If we continue to invest in our customers through great service and great products and great network, we know that will feed upon itself and it'll help us achieve the financial results that we're looking for."" Delta, United and American are approaching their 100th birthdays, and are trying to stay ahead — if not drive — shifting travel demand and still turn a profit. United is adding to the more than 300 airports it serves. Figuring out the next hot destination is ""part art"" and ""part science,"" said Patrick Quayle, its head of network planning. The airline's sprawling global network makes United the biggest U.S. airline by capacity and it recently launched service to places like Dubrovnik, Croatia, and Amman, Jordan. Quayle pointed to United's addition of Cape Town, South Africa, which it first announced before the pandemic, as a success. ""Another airline has subsequently copied us. ... I might want to add based in Atlanta,"" he said, alluding to Delta's home city. The latest changes come at a difficult time for a lot of U.S. airlines. Labor and other costs swelled after the pandemic, eating into margins despite record numbers of travelers. Added capacity in the U.S. market has forced carriers to discount fares in off-peak travel periods. It's tricky, and expensive, to change course. Even Southwest Airlines is facing investor pressure to add things like premium seating or seat assignments as its simple, but long successful, business model shows signs of age.

Meanwhile, U.S. consumers are growing more selective: Some corporate leaders have lamented a spending pullback while others, like Delta's CEO, are saying the opposite. Americans are still digging into the so-called experiences economy, and paying for more comfort along the way, according to Bastian. ""They may not be buying that new EV or that new house, but they're saying we're going to go out and experience the world and invest in that experience,"" he said. ""And that's why you see it happening in high-end concerts, high-end hospitality.""

'Brick by brick'

When the U.S. was careening toward recession almost two decades ago, Delta's leaders made a correct bet that travelers would eventually pay more to fly on its jets. Delta was emerging from Chapter 11 bankruptcy in 2007, which other U.S. carriers found themselves in the years after the Sept. 11, 2001, terrorist attacks. Former CEO Richard Anderson said the airline had to start with basics: stop losing bags. Make sure flights didn't get canceled and arrived on time. Clean up the cabins. ""It was about building the operation brick by brick,"" said Anderson, who handed the reins to Delta's former president, Bastian, in 2016. ""It didn't matter what you did with AmEx. If the flight canceled, you ruined your brand."" Delta took better care to avoid maintenance problems. It also started ferrying planes to airports to avoid cancellations if a replacement aircraft was needed. And the carrier tried to clean up its image, hiring a marketing firm that advised former President Barack Obama's 2008 presidential campaign.

Anderson said the airline needed to be consistent and not fly its mix of paint jobs and cabin interiors. It faced fresh competition from low-cost airlines like a then-spritely upstart out of Queens, New York, called JetBlue Airways . Delta and United had both launched their own low-cost subsidiaries, but they discontinued them. Delta executives knew they needed a brand to match if they were going to command a premium over competitors. ""One of the things about being a premium product is consistency, consistency in policy, consistency in appearance,"" said Anderson. ""If you got on a flight in Tokyo we wanted you to feel like you were home."" After the string of changes, Delta's performance improved. Corporate business travel contracts helped boost profits and still do, as business travel returns post-pandemic. Delta had a key advantage over competitors. After it came out of bankruptcy, it merged with Northwest Airlines in 2008, allowing it to stabilize and expand around the world while other carriers floundered. The rest of the industry spent much of the next decade recovering from bankruptcies and a subsequent musical chairs of mergers that left four big carriers in control of about three-quarters of the U.S. domestic market. Delta's rivals were years behind the carrier on integrating their merged staff, operations, networks and fleets. Bastian said Delta's focus on reliability has made life easier for not just its customers, but also its employees. ""They're not having to explain for a cancellation or mishandled luggage,"" he said. ""They have time to serve rather than to apologize."" Delta is also unique as the least unionized of the major U.S. airlines, at about 20%. In April, as campaigns were underway to organize its flight attendants and other workers, it again raised worker pay. Flight attendants for Delta's regional carrier, Endeavor, which are unionized, have recently demanded compensation on par with the carrier's mainline flight attendants.

Time to remodel

After Delta got the basics down, Bastian, 67, who joined Delta in 1998, said it was time for the airline to focus on more ambitious projects. ""You had the liberty to start investing in premium,"" he said. ""You started to figure out how to make first class more available to customers."" It has expanded in big-spending New York and Los Angeles, the country's two largest air travel markets by revenue, according to aviation data firm OAG. Delta also built up its host of global alliances, joint ventures and minority ownership stakes, giving it more reach. That includes its 49% stake in Virgin Atlantic, which already had a strong foothold in premium air travel and popular lounges. ""I think some of that heritage has made its way into the core of Delta,"" said Virgin Atlantic's CEO, Shai Weiss. ""I'm not suggesting we are the messiah for Delta, but there is no surprise that Delta and Virgin Atlantic see eye to eye on many things."" The vast majority of the more than 940 million people who flew on U.S. airlines last year fly in coach, and Delta has tried to make its flights more desirable to travelers on all sections of the plane. It remodeled old and dated terminals, and built out its network of luxury airport lounges, which are tied to its lucrative credit card deal with American Express. It added seatback televisions and better in-flight entertainment options, and in February 2023, it announced its long-awaited free Wi-Fi to customers enrolled in its SkyMiles frequent flyer program.

Delta has invested more than $12 billion to rebuild and update its U.S. hubs with soaring ceilings, new technology and in some lounges, a signature scent. (""It's proprietary,"" said Claude Roussel, who oversees Delta's lounges, when asked what was in it.) One of its latest efforts is its terminal and new Sky Club at New York's LaGuardia Airport, alongside other airlines' new terminals. A decade ago, then-Vice President Joe Biden famously said someone who was blindfolded and taken to that airport would think, ""I must be in some third-world country."" The airline faced big problems along the way like a dayslong system outage in 2016. And the worst of all: Covid-19. Like other airlines, Delta accepted billions in federal aid to weather the pandemic. The carrier successfully urged some 17,000 workers to take buyouts, hiring newer, lower-paid staff who lacked the experience of departed employees. Early in the process, Bastian said the newer workers gave the company a ""juniority benefit."" The airline employed about 100,000 people in the U.S. as of the end of last year. Delta and its competitors also pulled out of many small cities as the pandemic eased, isolating some smaller cities amid a shortage of regional jet pilots. But international travel has proved resilient so far, as consumers show they are willing to shell out on experiences.

Luxury air travel? In the U.S.?

Luxury air travel and the United States didn't go together for many years — and might not still, if you ask well-heeled globetrotters. U.S. airlines don't offer on-board showers or roomy suites like those on the superjumbos flown by the likes of Etihad Airways or Singapore Airlines. But the U.S. air travel market, the world's largest, has gotten a number of upgrades in recent years, and travelers have grown to expect the same convenience they get from their online shopping sites and ride-hailing and food-ordering apps. ""Delta's not bougie by any stretch, but when your competitors don't try very hard, it doesn't take much,"" said Henry Harteveldt, a former airline executive and founder of Atmosphere Research Group. But as a rewards credit card boom, strong consumer spending, social media envy and a wanderlust that predated the pandemic combined to boost demand, airlines executives were taking notice. Delta's sales from premium products are growing faster than revenue from its main coach cabin, a trend the airline forecasts will continue. Sales from Delta's loyalty business, premium cabins and other streams comprise more than half of the carrier's revenue. Airlines have made big changes as they struggle to accommodate the swelling numbers of big-spending travelers armed with elite status. Major carriers have all overhauled their frequent flyer programs to reward the biggest spenders instead of those who fly the most miles, and made it harder to earn coveted elite status. And at Delta and other airlines, many of the perks for luxury flyers come through lounges. One of Delta's Sky Clubs at Los Angeles International Airport offers a separate, dedicated security checkpoint for customers flying Delta One, away from the masses at the airport. That feature will make it to the new JFK lounge later this year, a Delta spokesman said. United and American Airlines have also worked to glam up and expand their airport lounges, access to which is a common perk with credit cards. Delta softened some restrictions on Sky Club lounge access last year — which it made to end annoying and unsightly long lines to enter its exclusive airport real estate — after an uproar from customers.

'We're constantly pushing each other""

Both Delta and United have issued sunny financial forecasts for this year, while many carriers are losing money or not pulling in similar profit margins. ""Watching [Delta] succeed, I became convinced that the product mattered and service mattered, and we have done that at United now,"" United CEO Scott Kirby said at a JPMorgan industry conference in March. And at an investor conference last month, he pointed to how the two are pulling away from the rest of the pack in profitability, particularly at big hubs. United has made some big bets that paid off. It held onto its wide-body planes, when travel demand collapsed in the pandemic, and has benefited from the surge in international travel. With United on Delta's tail, Bastian is trying to expand the airline's reach. Bastian has attended the massive Consumer Electronics Show in Las Vegas and has announced new partnerships with Lyft and Starbucks for its loyalty program.

The annual survey conducted by the China General Chamber of Commerce in the U.S. found that nearly 60% of companies aim to maintain a stable level of investment and that about 30% plan to boost it.

""A notable degree of long-term optimism persisted, with the majority expressing positive future revenue expectations,"" CGCC said, adding that the survey reflected ""a commendable sense of optimism, determination, and resilience.""

The survey was conducted in April and May of this year, polling nearly 100 Chinese companies across various industries about performance and outlook.

The report said Chinese firms remain committed to the U.S. market despite growing negative sentiment about the overall business environment amid rising trade tensions between the world's two largest economies.

Over 60% of survey respondents saw a deteriorating business environment in the U.S. Meanwhile, the rate of concern regarding a ""stalemate in Sino-US bilateral relations political and cultural relations"" surged to 93% from 81% a year prior.

Over the past year, the Biden administration has ramped up curbs on Chinese businesses, scrutinizing certain China-dominated industries, placing new sanctions on various Chinese firms and goods and trying to outright block Chinese ownership of certain companies and platforms.","A recent survey of Chinese enterprises in the U.S. has found that a majority remain bullish on the market long term despite growing concerns about U.S.-China relations and the broader business environment.

He went on to condemn the modern political left as “aggressively anti-common sense” during an interview with English journalist Tina Brown at the Aspen Ideas Festival in Colorado.

“Part of it the left has to own,” he told Brown. “They are aggressively anti-common sense. The Democrats keep running on this one idea, saying to the American people, ‘You can’t possibly think you can do worse than Donald Trump.’ And they keep saying, ‘Yes, we can. Yes, we can.'”

Maher went on to explain he has Democratic friends who have leftist children, many of whom, the comedian suggested, accuse their parents of “old thinking” and not understanding their progressive points of view.

“Tear down statues of Lincoln? Maybe give communism another shot? Get rid of the border patrol? Get rid of capitalism? White supremacy has never been worse? Gender is always just a social construct? It’s OK to have penises in the women’s swimming pool, in women’s prisons?” he said, listing a handful of the views held by leftists. “No, it’s not that I’m old; it’s that your ideas are stupid.”

Listen to the latest episode of “Quick Start”:

Maher explained to Brown that, if Democrats insist on embracing far-leftist ideals and refuse to collaborate in any way with Republicans who oppose Trump, they are only aiding the GOP in defeating incumbent President Joe Biden.

“That’s as good as it gets,” he said. “If you can’t talk to those people, you’re just abandoning the country to half the people who are even worse, who are going to vote for Trump this next time — and they are — and he very likely will win, and then what are we going to do?”

“I think we should keep the dialogue open,” the HBO’s “Real Time” host added.

Maher recently appeared on the ABC talk show “The View,” where he condemned those on the left who have chosen to vehemently oppose Israel and protest in support of Hamas.

“If I had any doubt that I was right about the change that’s happened in the left, watching people protest for a terrorist organization like Hamas — that straightened me out pretty quick,” he said, later adding, “It’s astounding to me that they can’t tell the good guys from the bad guys, just morally. If you’re for Hamas, just live in Gaza for a day … [even] before the war.”

Ultimately, he said the best way to stop Israel from retaliating is to “stop attacking Israel.”

In what's widely known as the Chevron case, the court took a step to curb the ability of the ballooning federal bureaucracy to bypass Congress with backdoor regulations.

In the other case, the high court issued a ruling about obstruction that could have a big impact on the future of President Trump and Capitol riot defendants.

The Chevron Case & the 'Deep State'



In a far-reaching decision, the Supreme Court upended the 40-year-old Chevron precedent that made it easier for federal government agencies to create their own rules on issues like the environment, public health, and business regulations.

The original Chevron decision allowed federal agencies to unilaterally fill in the details whenever government officials claimed the laws passed by Congress were too ambiguous.

Critics have argued for decades that only Congress has been given the power to legislate, so allowing bureaucrats broad power to invent thousands of regulations violates the U.S. Constitution. It's one of the reasons those critics have referred to the massive size of the federal government as the ""nanny state"" or even the ""deep state"" because unelected bureaucrats often seized that opportunity to operate autonomously from the legislative or judicial branches.

BREAKING: In a major blow to the unelected administrative state, the Supreme Court has overruled the Chevron doctrine, which required courts to defer to the legal interpretations of unelected bureaucrats.



“Chevron is overruled.” pic.twitter.com/tqC5EYaUBl — Sean Davis (@seanmdav) June 28, 2024

Chief Justice John Roberts wrote the court's opinion stating, ""Perhaps most fundamentally, Chevron's presumption is misguided because agencies have no special competence in resolving statutory ambiguities. Courts do.""

Tyler O'Neil, managing editor of the Daily Signal, wrote on X, ""This is a huge step forward for holding the administrative state—and the deep state—accountable.""

The Capitol Riot and Obstruction

In the other major case, the Supreme Court made it harder to charge Capitol riot defendants with obstruction, a charge that also has been brought against former President Donald Trump.

In a 6-3 ruling, the court ruled that charging someone with obstructing an official proceeding must include proof that defendants tried to tamper with or destroy documents. Only some of the people who breached the Capitol on Jan. 6, 2021, fall into that category, so many of those cases are expected to be affected by reduced sentencing.

Liberty Counsel Founder and Chairman Mat Staver said, ""This new narrow interpretation will make it difficult for these indictments to stand.""

Chief Justice John Roberts wrote Friday's decision, joined by Justices Samuel Alito, Neil Gorsuch, Brett Kavanaugh, and Clarence Thomas, and by Biden nominee Justice Ketanji Brown Jackson.

It's unclear how the court's decision might affect the obstruction case by Special Counsel Jack Smith against Trump in Washington. But the high court is expected to release a separate decision Monday regarding presidential immunity, and that ruling will directly impact Smith's case.

Some are even calling for Biden to be replaced as the nominee.



Voters were also concerned by what they saw from the president as he struggled and stumbled throughout the evening.



Within the opening minutes, he flubbed a line saying, ""What I've been able to do with the Covid, excuse me, with, dealing with everything we have to do with, look, if we finally beat Medicare.""

Cognitive Concerns



It became clear to the former President's surrogates, that Biden was in trouble.

Rep. Elise Stefanik (R-NY) said, ""The Biden campaign said this would be the reset moment for Joe Biden's candidacy and what they saw, what the American people saw, was a weak, horrible president, who is the weakest president in our nation's history.""



Voter concerns about Biden's age and mental sharpness were on display during the 90-minute debate as the president struggled at times to answer questions.



Sen. Marco Rubio (R-FL) said, ""He repeated things that were not true and he also said things that, to be frank, there were times that I could not understand what he was saying.""



The showdown had Biden and Trump, the two oldest candidates to ever seek the White House, trading barbs on a number of topics.



On the Economy



""The only jobs he created are for illegal immigrants and bounce back jobs that bounce back from the Covid. He has not done a good job, he's done a poor job, and inflation is killing our country,"" Trump said.



On Abortion



""We are not for late-term abortion. Period. Period, period,"" Biden said.

Trump replied, ""Under Roe v Wade, you have late-term abortion. You can do whatever you want. Depending on the state, you can do whatever you want. We don't think that's a good thing. We think it's a radical thing. We think the Democrats are the radicals.""



On Immigration



Biden said, ""When he was president, he was taking separating babies from their mothers, put him in cages, making sure that the families were separated. That's not the way to go.""



Trump pushed back accusing Biden of putting in place weak border policies that make America unsafe.

""We have the largest number of terrorists coming into our country right now. All terrorists all over the world, not just in South America, all over the world. They come from the Middle East, everywhere, all over the world. That pouring in. And this guy just left it open.""

Biden's Poor Performance



The two also tackled wars in Ukraine and Gaza.



But by the end of the night, everyone was talking about President Biden's poor performance.

Michigan resident Rosanne Ponkowski said, ""I have dealt with people that have dementia before, and it's very obvious just from the look on his face, not understanding what's going on, the surprised and shocked look sometimes, the eyes, the very stiff face, the very stiff hands, they're all very prominent signs of what's going on.""

The White House tried to put a brave face on the evening telling reporters that Biden had a cold.



Surrogates like California Governor Gavin Newsom (D) attempted to side-step voter concerns that the president is too old.



CBN News directly asked Gov. Newsom, ""There's a lot of concern about the president's stamina and mental health. Are you concerned, 81 years old, are concerned about that going forward?"" Newsom replied, ""I'm worried about President Trump's stamina."" We followed up with, ""No, I'm talking about the president."" Newsom replied, ""No, I'm talking about President Trump as well.""



One top Biden donor reportedly called the president's performance disqualifying, telling Reuters that he expects Democrats will urge him to step aside ahead of the party's national convention in August.

Still, in a post-debate rally, Biden told supporters that he was confident he could win against Trump. ""Look, we're going to beat this guy. We need to beat this guy. And I need you in order to beat him. You're the people I've run for,"" Biden said.



Coming into the debate, Biden and Trump found themselves nearly tied in some national opinion polls. We'll see in the coming days whether this debate did anything to significantly change those dynamics. For now, though, the race is set to be decided here in Georgia and a handful of other key swing states like Wisconsin, Michigan, and Arizona. Meanwhile, voters there and across the country will get another look at the candidates on September 10th.","ATLANTA – Democrats are panicking over President Biden's shaky performance in last night's historic debate with former President Trump.

(AP Photo/Alex Brandon)

In one of the most eagerly anticipated opinions of this term, the U.S. Supreme Court has essentially decided to kick the can down the road on Idaho's abortion law.

The official release of the ruling comes a day after the decision was prematurely leaked by someone at the Supreme Court. It was published online briefly on Wednesday before being removed. A court spokeswoman said the post was a mistake.

The decision will allow emergency abortions for now in a procedural ruling that leaves key questions unanswered. For now, the Idaho case will continue to play out in lower courts, and could end up before the Supreme Court again.

Liberty Counsel Founder and Chairman Mat Staver explained, ""This order means that the case returns to the Ninth Circuit, which had ordered that the appeal of the preliminary injunction be decided by the full court on an expedited basis without any further briefing. The abortion ban currently remains in place in Idaho, except for those in emergency room situations.""

WATCH Our Analysis: Supreme Court Rules on Idaho Abortion Ban

What the Case Is Really About

The Biden administration had sued Idaho claiming the state's law violates a federal law called the Emergency Medical Treatment and Labor Act (EMTALA). The White House insists the EMTALA requires hospital emergency rooms to provide abortions to women if their general health is at risk. Idaho's law already provided an exception to save the life of the mother, so the case is seen as an effort to expand abortion access beyond that.

Idaho Solicitor General Joshua Turner suggested the Biden administration's ""health"" definition is too broad because it could be interpreted to include many non-life-threatening health concerns, including mental health.

And the Alliance Defending Freedom accused the Biden administration of trying to invent ""a federal abortion mandate by manipulating EMTALA.""

During the arguments at the court, Justice Samuel Alito said the EMTALA was not intended to include abortion because it specifically identifies unborn children as patients who should be cared for in emergency rooms.

""One potentially very important phrase in EMTALA,"" he said, ""is the reference to the woman's unborn child. Isn't that an odd phrase to put in a statute that imposes a mandate to perform abortions? Have you ever seen an abortion statute that uses the phrase, 'unborn child?'""

Alito pointed out, ""So in that situation, the hospital must stabilize the threat to the unborn child. And it seems like the plain meaning is that the hospital must try to eliminate any immediate threat to the child. Performing an abortion is antithetical to that duty.""

Abortion Leaks at the Supreme Court

Two years ago, Politico obtained a draft of the Dobbs ruling that overturned Roe v. Wade, stoking widespread outrage by pro-choice activists before the ruling was officially meant to be revealed. It fueled extremists who began firebombing and vandalizing pro-life pregnancy clinics and issuing death threats to the workers who try to help women facing unexpected pregnancies.

The Supreme Court never discovered who infamously leaked that Dobbs ruling, and now there is speculation about why this Idaho abortion ruling was also leaked.



Pro-life activist Kristan Hawkins posted on X, ""With media reporting on what appears to be a disappointing outcome in the EMTALA case, you have to wonder whether it's time for some people working on our nation's highest court need to be invited to find new jobs. Did the person who leaked the Dobbs decision 'accidentally' post today? Inquiring minds want to know.""","An pro-life protestor is seen on the ground after being pushed during a protest by abortion activists at the Supreme Court, June 24, 2024.

Now there's been a major revelation about how the Biden administration has pushed the transgender agenda when it comes to children.

According to the New York Times, Biden officials played a significant role in convincing an international pro-transgender medical group to remove age limits from its guidelines for trans surgeries.

""Email excerpts from members of the World Professional Association for Transgender Health (WPATH) recount how staff for Adm. Rachel Levine, assistant secretary for health at the Department of Health and Human Services and herself a transgender woman, urged them to drop the proposed limits from the group's guidelines and apparently succeeded,"" The Times reports.

The administration was reportedly concerned that age minimums would trigger political backlash that could fuel legislation opposing the trans ideology.

More than two dozen states now have laws restricting gender-altering medical experiments on the bodies of minors. And this week, the Supreme Court agreed to hear the Biden administration's challenge to one of those laws.

LATEST Supreme Court Takes up Hot Topic of Gender-Altering Procedures on Children

Critics say children are too young to make these irreversible, life-altering decisions while supporters claim that young people with gender dysphoria need the procedures right away.

But as CBN News reported earlier this year, U.S.-based think tank Environmental Progress reported that even the WPATH admitted behind closed doors that ""children and adolescents cannot comprehend the lifelong consequences of 'gender-affirming care,' and in some cases, due to poor health literacy, neither can their parents.""

When we confronted WPATH about those claims, Marci Bowers, M.D., president of the group, told us in a statement, ""The world is not flat. Gender, like genitalia, is represented by diversity. The small percentage of the population that is trans or gender diverse deserves healthcare and will never be a threat to the global gender binary.""

Meanwhile, England and other European nations are backing away from transition procedures on minors after studies showed ""weak evidence"" that they lead to long-term positive impacts.

""This is one instance in which I think Europe is headed in the right direction,"" Sarah Parshall Perry of the Heritage Foundation told CBN's Wendy Griffith. ""In addition to that, we are now seeing Norway, Finland, Sweden, and now the most recent edition is Scotland who has backed off the use of chemical castration agents as well.""

There is also a growing number of people who regret undergoing gender transition and are seeking to revert back to their biological gender. They're warning distressed children and their families about rushing into life-altering medical decisions.

This debate is also the earliest in modern history, well ahead of the traditional fall schedule.

New rules aim to prevent chaotic scenes from past debates. There will be no live audience, no opening statements, and both candidates' microphones will be muted unless it's their turn to speak.

Performance on the debate stage might be the most crucial aspect for the 81-year-old Biden as Republicans highlight his age and mental health.

""Which Joe Biden's going to show up?"" asked House Speaker Mike Johnson. ""My summary is this: It doesn't matter if he drinks a whole gallon of energy drinks, he's not going to be able to match the acumen and the readiness of Donald Trump.""

Nathan Gonzales from Inside Elections tells CBN News that because some Republicans have portrayed Biden as too old and incompetent, the real challenge may lie with Donald Trump. ""Trump is used to feeding off the crowd and energy in the room, and that's just not going to be there,"" Gonzales explained. ""Trump is going to have to be disciplined when it comes to time and whether the mic is on or off. He must avoid being perceived as a bully.""

Biden is expected to focus on Trump's 34 felony convictions—a first for a presidential candidate—and other pending criminal cases. He will also likely address the abortion issue after the Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade, thanks to three Trump appointees. Trump, on the other hand, is expected to highlight issues such as the flood of unchecked migrants on the U.S. southern border and high inflation.

President Biden has been preparing for the debate at Camp David over the past several days. Former President Trump has been on the campaign trail, and Wednesday night, he attended a prayer conference call with members of a faith advisory board.

That news comes as top Israeli leaders visited the border with Lebanon where war could break out any day.

Aides to the prime minister have reportedly told the White House that when Netanyahu addresses a joint session of Congress in July, he'll present a new take on achieving a pathway to a Palestinian state. That would be a huge shift.

Yet those reports may be wrong. The Prime Minister's Office told The Times of Israel that Netanyahu ""opposes a Palestinian state and will not change his position in his address to Congress.""

The prime minister has consistently opposed Palestinian statehood in recent years, as poll after poll shows a huge majority of West Bank Palestinians themselves don't want a state next to Israel. They just want Israel destroyed.

Itamar Marcus, director of Palestinian Media Watch, points out most Palestinians hail the murderous attacks on Israelis, including what happened on October 7th.

""There's tremendous support within the West Bank for what happened on October 7th,"" Marcus stated. ""There was a poll taken a month and a half after October 7th – and everyone knew what happened, everybody knew about the rape and the destruction and the massacres – and Palestinians were asked 'With everything that's happened up till now, does it make you proud as a Palestinian?' And 98 percent of Palestinians said it made them proud.""

Preparing for War with Hezbollah & US Weapons Delays

On another front, both Netanyahu and Israeli President Isaac Herzog toured Israel's northern border with Lebanon this week. That's where all-out war may soon come, as the Jewish nation seeks to end daily attacks from Hezbollah on Israeli communities along the border.

In Washington, Israel's Defense Minister Yoav Gallant has supposedly made progress in speeding up shipments of weapons to the U.S. from Israel.

Netanyahu has accused the Biden administration of deliberately slow-walking such shipments.

For the first time, the U.S. administration is admitting there have been bottlenecks in getting some of those weapons shipped.

Gallant addressed Americans, saying Israel needs the U.S. by its side. ""The powerful and enduring bond between the United States and Israel is key to our nation's strategy and our security,"" the defense minister said.

Pennsylvania Sen. John Fetterman has been one Democrat particularly strong in supporting Israel's war with Hamas as others have wavered. He's met with Netanyahu on his first visit here. ""We stand with Israel through this and I'm so sorry for what's been done to this nation,"" Fetterman declared.

Turkey's President Recep Tayyip Erdogan pledged that his nation will stand with Hezbollah if it comes to war. He's condemning Western nations for backing Netanyahu, whose mental fitness he questioned. Erdogan asserted, ""It is extremely bad and pathetic that governments that talk about freedom, human rights, and justice are captives of a mentally ill person like Netanyahu.""

Antisemitism in NYC

In New York City, a masked man who demanded Jews get off a subway car earlier this month faces criminal charges of attempted coercion. He had yelled, ""Raise your hands if you're a Zionist – this is your chance to get out!""

Earlier this week, several dozen people protested against Manhattan District Attorney Alvin Bragg for his refusal to prosecute most of the anti-Israel demonstrators who illegally occupied Columbia University's Hamilton Hall this spring.

One protester said of Bragg, ""He's either a coward or an antisemite.""

The Department of Homeland Security is searching for hundreds of ISIS-related ""subjects of concern"" who crossed the southern U.S. border illegally.

The DHS says more than 400 migrants came into the U.S. from Central Asia through a smuggling network affiliated with the Islamic terrorist group referred to as ISIS. Only about 150 have been arrested while others are reportedly being tracked across 17 states.

However, the whereabouts of more than 50 of those suspects are unknown.

Most of the ISIS-connected individuals who crossed the border were allowed to stay because they were not on a terrorism watch list, according to NBC News.

""It's only a matter of time before one of these individuals connected to a terrorist group is involved in something devastating on U.S. soil, and this administration will be responsible. How much longer will we let this madness continue?"" Green asked.

Recent attacks in Russia, such as this weekend's assault on churches and synagogues in the republic of Dagestan, have raised concerns about the terror group ISIS and its offshoots spreading abroad.

Earlier this month, federal agents revealed they had arrested eight people in several U.S. cities with alleged ties to ISIS.

Federal agencies released a joint statement saying, ""The individuals arrested are detained in ICE custody pending removal proceedings … The FBI and DHS will continue working around the clock with our partners to identify, investigate, and disrupt potential threats to national security.""

Fortune,https://fortune.com/2024/06/30/us-deficit-outlook-debt-service-costs-treasury-bond-market-federal-reserve/,2024-06-30,22:20:29 UTC,"The U.S. deficit is nearly as big a Russia’s economy, and there’s a ‘vicious’ feedback loop that could make it worse","The presidential election has brought the issue of federal budget deficits back into the spotlight as markets weigh the impact of another Biden or Trump administration on government revenue and spending.

A week before this past Thursday’s presidential debate, the Congressional Budget Office updated its projections for U.S. debt and deficits.

The CBO’s new estimate for the fiscal 2024 deficit is now $1.9 trillion, up from its prior view for $1.6 trillion issued in February and up from the 2023 deficit of about $1.7 trillion.

While the 2024 figure falls short of the pandemic-era high of $3 trillion, a level of $1.9 trillion nearly matches Russia’s entire GDP, which the World Bank put at $2 trillion in 2023, making it the 11th biggest economy in the world.

Part of the reason for the increase in the projected 2024 deficit was to account for emergency spending that went to help Ukraine fight Russia, the CBO said. Other emergency appropriations went to Israel and U.S. allies in Asia.

Meanwhile, the U.S. deficit eclipses other major economies like Mexico’s ($1.79 trillion), Australia’s ($1.72 trillion), and South Korea’s ($1.71 trillion).

For now, financial markets have largely focused more on inflation data and when the Federal Reserve will cut rates. But that doesn’t mean the risks of a widening deficit and debt are absent.

Former New York Fed President Bill Dudley told Bloomberg TV on Wednesday that unsustainable trends always come to an end.

He also warned that the situation could go south quickly. For example, if bond markets start to balk at buying Treasuries, interest rates will go up to attract more demand. That leads to the government paying more for debt service costs, which then adds further to the deficit.

“So the feedback loop here can be quite vicious,” Dudley said. “The hard thing is to know the timing.”

He added that there’s less demand for U.S. Treasury bonds in certain corners of the global market because Western sanctions on Russia prompted other countries to diversify away from dollar-denominated assets.

In addition, debt that was issued at lower rates is now being rolled over to higher rates, so debt service costs are going up more rapidly than total debt, Dudley said.

The election and its aftermath could be catalysts. Amid a Wall Street Journal report that said Trump’s allies have drawn up plans to erode the Fed’s independence, an election victory could raise concerns the Fed will monetize U.S. debt by buying more Treasuries and stoking inflation.

To be sure, it wouldn’t be easy to gain control over the Fed as the regional bank presidents aren’t appointed by the White House and Fed governors have staggered terms, Dudley pointed out.

“That said, just the mere attempt to take control of the Fed, to diminish the Fed’s independence could be the spark that rattles markets,” he added.","The CBO’s new estimate for the fiscal 2024 deficit is now $1.9 trillion, up from its prior view for $1.6 trillion issued in February and up from the 2023 deficit of about $1.7 trillion.

Fortune,https://fortune.com/asia/2024/06/30/david-meets-goliath-japan-korea-make-startups-work-large-conglomerates-twist-silicon-valley/,2024-06-30,21:00:00 UTC,"Japan, Korea twist Silicon Valley model through conglomerate-startup connections","We all know how things work in Silicon Valley. Brilliant individuals with great ideas disrupt whole industries: Uber and public transport, Tesla and car-making, even Microsoft and the workplace itself. Older incumbents won’t, and can’t, adapt with the times—and so they disappear, replaced by the firms of today and tomorrow. It’s the way tech hubs are supposed to work.

Except that not all do.

The Silicon Valley model is tied closely to the economic model of the U.S.—and so difficult to replicate elsewhere. Silicon Valley excels in some aspects of frontier technology but lost its manufacturing edge long ago.

Around the world, policymakers are tweaking the idea of Silicon Valley to better match the idiosyncrasies of their own economies and carve out a unique advantage in key global markets.

Look to Japan and Korea for examples. Large conglomerates dominate the economies of both countries, whether Japan’s keiretsu or South Korea’s chaebol. Officials in Tokyo and Seoul don’t see the point of startups disrupting hugely successful and internationalized companies to the point that they disappear.

Instead, they want startups to work with giants like Hyundai, Samsung, SK, Sony or Toyota. It’s an instance of David meeting Goliath: an open innovation model where small firms and big conglomerates work together, aided by the government. This approach helps policymakers innovate in the design and manufacturing of tomorrow’s technologies.

Critics often accuse chaebols and keiretsu of stifling competition. But Japanese and Korean policymakers don’t want to work against the conglomerates that have helped their countries become two of the richest and most innovate economies in the world.

For a forthcoming book, titled Startup Capitalism, we studied how both Japan and Korea tried to foster this collaboration between startups and conglomerates. Government support for this “David and Goliath” relationship survived Japan and Korea’s frequent changes in political leadership; it’s now part of the fabric of both economies.

But why is this the case?

To begin with, startups get access to expertise, mentoring, and sales channels that they’d find difficult to develop on their own. Managers in a conglomerate like LG and Nissan have decades of experience in their core business sectors. Startup founders, generally, do not—instead relying on connections from VC backers or their own personal networks

Programs such as K-Startup Grand Challenge, anchored by Seoul’s Ministry of SMEs & Startups, or J-Startup, led by Tokyo’s Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry, help to bridge this asymmetry in resources and access. Large firms join these government programs as judges, coaches, and would-be partners for startups. The Japanese and Korean governments thus act as matchmakers between entrepreneurs and leading conglomerates. (The U.S. policy approach, instead, is to only support startups.)

By taking part in these programs, Japanese and Korean startups also get access to capital and, often, exit strategies. Seoul and Tokyo pour billions of taxpayer dollars into supporting entrepreneurs via institutions like the Korea Venture Investment Corporation or the Japan Finance Corporation. Connecting these startups with chaebol or keiretsu that otherwise may not know about their ideas or products makes it easier for the big firms to decide whether to invest in their smaller counterparts.

So, startups clearly benefit from working with conglomerates. But what do larger companies get out of this?

The second advantage of this open innovation model is that the keiretsu and chaebol get access to new ideas and products. Several Japanese and Korean policymakers told us that they were worried that their national champions might go the way of Motorola or Nokia, former innovation powerhouses that got left behind. Working together with startups is one way that big conglomerates can develop new products and improve existing ones.

Ultimately, Japan and Korea want startups and conglomerates to work together to improve the economy. They see startups as drivers of innovation and growth in quality jobs; conglomerates help these smaller firms achieve that.

Conglomerates also provide manufacturing chops needed to make future technologies at scale. Silicon Valley long ago outsourced the production of key technologies, like semiconductors, elsewhere. Bringing those manufacturing abilities—that offer quality jobs and contribute to clusters of talent—back onshore is a key aim of the U.S.’s multi-billion-dollar CHIPS Act.

In fact, it seems this model of startups working together with large companies is now getting picked up in other parts of the world. In the AI sector, Microsoft is working with smaller partners like ChatGPT developer OpenAI and France’s Mistral. Both Amazon and Google have invested in developers like Anthropic; China’s big tech companies are also buying large stakes in the country’s AI startups. The Biden administration and the Von der Leyen Commission are both pushing startup-big firm collaboration as part of their respective industrial policies.

We should expect the Japanese and Korean model of startup-big firm collaboration to become more widespread. Governments are turning towards industrial policy and economic nationalism, and away from laissez-faire liberalism—in other words, closer to the policies long espoused by Tokyo and Seoul.

The Guardian,https://www.theguardian.com/politics/article/2024/jun/29/disbelief-as-us-uk-trade-deals-under-threat-after-britain-axes-negotiators,2024-06-29,20:09:34 UTC,‘Disbelief’ as US-UK trade deals under threat after Britain axes negotiators,"America was meant to be Britain’s route to the sunlit uplands of Brexit. Then, after hopes of a free trade deal evaporated, successive Conservative governments have set their sights lower, by trying to forge closer ties with individual US states.

Now the civil servants responsible for delivering those state-level deals have been let go, in what a furious British businessman described as “an act of arson”.

Nearly a seventh of trade posts within British consulates in the US have been axed, with 24 people losing their jobs, 18 from 139 posts in the trade department. The decision was taken barely two weeks before Rishi Sunak called the general election.

Many of the trade teams, based in the nine consulates across the US, had worked on trade pacts with Kemi Badenoch, the business and trade secretary, jetting around America to sign memorandums of understanding with governors of states including Florida, Indiana and Oklahoma.

But more importantly, according to British business leaders in the US, the regional trade directors and their staff had decades of experience and had built up contacts with American businesses from Google and Meta to the heads of Hollywood studios.

Jules Ehrhardt, a designer and investor, said there was “outrage and disbelief in the British business community” at the decision.

“They are tossing out collective centuries of relational and institutional knowledge core to the UK-US trading relationship,” he said. Ehrhardt moved to the US in 2012 to open the American arm of Ustwo, a digital design studio behind award-winning games such as Monument Valley, and worked with Google, Nike and Twitter, before founding a venture capital firm, FKTRY.

He said the consulate directors had “served as the connective tissue” between British and American business leaders, making introductions, giving advice and lending their expertise. “We shot ourselves in both feet by undermining Britain’s ‘gateway to Europe’ status for American companies following Brexit, and were told to go west, and now we’ve self-elected a lobotomy,” Ehrhardt said.

“This [is an] act of arson in the final stages of this government. We claim it is a special relationship, yet remove our people at the very heart of it.”

Allan Rooney, founder of Rooney Law, which has helped more than 300 companies from the UK, Ireland and Australia enter the US market, said the directors were “absolutely critical in building strong and mutually beneficial trade relationships between UK and US businesses”.

“The facilitation of strategic introductions that these directors provide is a massive benefit,” he said. “They plug companies into a market they otherwise don’t know anything about. They familiarise them via trade missions and other methods to support and understand the market and the subtle differences between the UK and the US ‘doing business’ culture. Removing that layer will impact trade relations.

“More than a million Brits are employed by American businesses – I can’t think of a more important trade relationship post-Brexit. It’s critical. And I think the removal of a very large swathe of intellectual capital and institutional knowledge is potentially worrisome. It could strain the trade teams who are already short on resources.”

Another US-based British business executive said that there was very little stability in the UK’s consulates because they were usually staffed by Foreign & Commonwealth Office officials who stayed in the US for four-year periods. “It’s a constant revolving door,” the executive said. “Those are the people we lean on.”

William Bain, head of trade policy at the British Chambers of Commerce, said: “If we want to grow our economy then we need to boost trade, so it’s a concern if cuts are being made to the team supporting key export sectors in the US, our second largest trading partner.

“We need to scale up, not slash, our support for companies seeking to enter or raise market share in the US. This is especially true as we hope to see deals on critical minerals and digital trade reached with the US federal government in the next year or so.”

Boris Johnson, Liam Fox and other Brexiters had hoped that signing a trade deal with the US would provide economic growth for the UK, but Johnson failed to persuade either Donald Trump or Joe Biden. Last June, Rishi Sunak signed an “Atlantic declaration” with Biden which allowed UK firms access to some US subsidies.

State-level deals have seen some recognition of British professional qualifications and removed some regulatory barriers.

A UK government spokesperson said: “The UK’s trade and investment teams in America are fully focused on furthering UK interests in the US, driving investment and strengthening our trading relationship with our closest ally. We continually keep our structures under review to ensure they deliver maximum impact for the UK, ensure the highest quality service to businesses, while offering taxpayers the very best value for money.”","Nearly a seventh of trade posts within British consulates in the US have been axed, with 24 people losing their jobs, 18 from 139 posts in the trade department.

The Guardian,https://www.theguardian.com/business/article/2024/jun/30/better-economic-news-will-not-stop-tories-from-suffering-their-biggest-ever-defeat,2024-06-30,10:14:41 UTC,Better economic news will not stop Tories from suffering their biggest ever defeat | Larry Elliott,"Down the years the Conservative party has taken some heavy election beatings but the one in prospect this week could be of a different order of magnitude.

Assuming the polls are right – and they have been consistent since the start of the campaign – the Tories will do worse even than in 1906, their previous nadir. Back then, the Conservatives and their Liberal Unionist allies won just 156 seats, a repeat of which on Thursday would now be considered a good result.

But in 1906, Arthur Balfour’s outgoing government secured more than 43% of the vote, while Rishi Sunak is polling at about half that level. And Balfour’s defeat could at least be attributed to a policy issue – free trade versus protectionism. Today, voters just seem sick of the Tories.

News on the economy since the election was called has had little or no impact on the polls. In part, that’s because the signals have been mixed: inflation fell back to its 2% target and growth in the first quarter of 2024 has been revised up, but the economy stagnated in April and unemployment has increased.

Living standards are certainly improving. The Resolution Foundation thinktank calculates that real per capita household disposable income – a guide to whether people are getting better off after inflation is taken into account – rose by 2.4% over the past year.

That’s the good news. The bad news is that over the 2019-24 parliament as a whole, living standards fell by 0.6% and one of the unwritten rules of political economy is that governments don’t remain popular when voters are getting poorer.

Only twice in the past century have living standards been lower at the end of a parliament than when it commenced: in 1918-22, when the UK suffered from a post-first world war boom-bust, and in the short parliament of 1950-51, when inflation rose sharply as a result of the rearmament programme for the Korean war.

In the inevitable postmortem examination that will follow the election, attention will focus on whether the Tories might have done better had Sunak delayed the election so that in time more voters would have come to think an economic corner genuinely had been turned. Another quarter or two of rising living standards would not have saved the Conservatives from defeat but it would probably have limited the scale of it.

As it is, Rachel Reeves will be the beneficiary. Analysts have been revising up their growth estimates for 2024 and 2025 on the basis that consumers will start to run down the precautionary savings they accumulated during the cost of living crisis.

Other recent developments – especially those overseas – are not so welcome. Joe Biden’s poor performance in his head to head debate with Donald Trump has made it more likely that the latter will win the US presidential election. Tariffs will be raised and taxes will be cut if that happens, threatening higher inflation and rising debt.

Meanwhile, the first round of voting in France’s parliamentary election looks set to show sizeable gains for Marine Le Pen’s rightwing National Rally party and a defeat for Emmanuel Macron’s centrist government.

Events in both the US and France highlight how things have changed in the near decade and a half since Labour was last in power.

Most obviously, the world has become a less safe place. The war between Ukraine and Russia is now well into its third year and has shattered the notion that permanent peace can be guaranteed for western developed nations. There are always demands for Labour governments to spend more on the NHS and on the welfare state. This time there will also be pressure to raise defence spending.

Globalisation has gone into retreat. Weak growth since the financial crisis of 2008-09 has seen a marked increase in protectionist measures – not just on goods but on people too. In Europe, North America and Australasia alike there have been demands for governments to restrict the number of foreign nationals entering the country.

What’s more, multilateral bodies are for the most part weaker than they were in 2010. The increasingly fractious relationship between the US and China means the G20 group of leading developed and developing nations cannot agree on much. The World Trade Organization is a much-diminished institution, unable to fulfil either of its core functions: to negotiate multilateral trade deals and be the final arbiter in trade disputes. The EU is having to contend with rising nationalist sentiment, a function of feeble economic performance and a reaction against rule by unelected technocrats.

The developing world has been even harder hit by Covid and the cost of living crisis than the rich west, increasing the incentive for migrants to look for a better life elsewhere. Yet aid budgets have been cut and promises to help poor countries cope with the impact of climate change have not been fulfilled. The world is getting hotter and the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank urgently need more money to meet demands for their assistance.

So those are the sort of challenges that Labour will face when it takes office later this week. Not the world of 1997, when Russia was seen as an ally rather than a strategic threat. Not the middle of the Great Moderation – the period between the fall of communism and the global financial crisis – when the west enjoyed year after year of growth and low inflation, but rather a world still trying to claw its way out of the Great Stagnation of the past 15 years.

And an angrier world where voters can quickly turn on their governments. Labour should enjoy its honeymoon period. It might not last long.","And Balfour’s defeat could at least be attributed to a policy issue – free trade versus protectionism.

Unless the polls are wildly inaccurate, the Conservative party is heading towards a catastrophic defeat in the coming election.

All across the rich world, voters are angry at their governments – they blame politicians for a burst of inflation that happened almost everywhere and is now subsiding almost everywhere, including in the UK. But the Conservatives deserve defeat more than most: they took power 14 years ago promising to deliver responsible policies and economic success. Instead they have presided over economic stagnation and a collapse in public services.

Why has Conservative governance gone so badly? It is natural to blame Brexit, which did indeed increase trade frictions and therefore surely had a negative effect on British real income. However, Brexit has not had the disastrous effects some predicted, and has somewhat perversely led to a rise rather than a fall in immigration, especially of the highly skilled.

In fact, the roots of Britain’s poor economic performance are older and deeper than Brexit. Though many bad decisions undoubtedly contributed, one central cause was the way David Cameron and George Osborne gratuitously embraced fiscal austerity when they came to power after the global financial crisis.

At the time, this looked like an obvious macroeconomic error; more than a decade later, it has become a social and political catastrophe.

Let us recall the circumstances when the Conservatives took power. The financial crisis had produced a severe global recession; by 2010 the world economy was growing again, but all major economies, Britain included, were still operating far below capacity and had high unemployment.

Textbook economics tells us that when unemployment is high and inflation is low, governments should try to stimulate demand with reduced interest rates and fiscal deficits. Interest cuts were not an option because rates were already close to zero, so the indicated policy was fiscal stimulus.

Yet the Cameron government chose to do the opposite, pulling back fiscal support from an economy that still needed it badly. Britain was not the only nation turning to fiscal austerity in the face of high unemployment – Greece engaged in savage austerity, while Portugal, Spain, Italy and Ireland made large cuts, and fiscal policy in the US also turned contractionary.

What made the British case unique was that it was almost entirely an unforced error. Southern European austerity was a response to pressure from the bond markets: Greece was in effect cut off from private markets, while other nations faced sharply increased borrowing costs, becoming dependent on official lenders who insisted on budget cuts as a condition for loans. Bond buyers never lost faith in the US, but after 2010 Barack Obama faced a deeply hostile Congress, which in effect blackmailed him into spending cuts by threatening to provoke a government default.

While Britain had low borrowing costs like the US, its government was not divided. The Cameron executive could have chosen to maintain spending. Why did it turn to austerity?

Part of the answer is that policymakers were genuinely spooked by the sudden emergence of the crisis in Greece. Until Greece hit the wall, debt crises were generally thought of as a problem that happened only in poorer nations. It is understandable that many observers, at least initially, wondered if the Greek crisis was the leading edge of a broader attack by bond vigilantes.

But UK debt was clearly far smaller relative to the economy than Greece’s – and it became obvious early on that contagion from the Greek debt crisis was restricted to eurozone nations. So there was no reason to continue believing that the UK risked “becoming Greece”, as many politicians recklessly claimed at the time.

In fact, it soon became clear that even the eurozone crisis was more a matter of market panic than one of fundamentally unsustainable levels of debt. As the economist Paul De Grauwe has said, nations with debts in another country’s currency can suffer something similar to a bank run: panicked investors seeking to pull out their funds can cause a government to run out of cash, forcing it into default. Nations that borrow in their own currency are not vulnerable to such a self-fulfilling crisis, because they can in effect print money in a crunch.

This analysis was validated in 2012 when Mario Draghi, the president of the European Central Bank (ECB), said three words: “Whatever it takes.” This was taken to mean that the ECB would, if necessary, supply cash to governments facing a market panic. And suddenly the euro “debt” crisis faded away, with investors demanding much lower interest rates on the debt of Italy, Spain and so on.

Since Britain has not adopted the euro and had debts in its own currency, it was not vulnerable to this kind of cash crisis.

The bottom line is that there was no pressing economic need to slash spending in the face of high unemployment. I would argue that the best way to explain Britain’s austerity is not economic but sociological.

Sociology? I used to talk about the push for austerity being led by Very Serious People (a term I borrowed from the blogger Duncan Black). This was not really a joke: if you spend any time consorting with members of the global policy elite, you realise that many of them are driven primarily by the desire to appear “serious”. In economic terms, this usually means pushing policies that will cause significant hardship – to other people, of course.

The obsession with perceived seriousness reflects peer pressure, but in some ways also reflects personal careerism. Officials in democratic nations cannot expect to remain in office for more than a few years. What do they do next? If they have lobbied for “serious” policies, they can have a bright future giving speeches at Davos about the importance of making “tough choices”. Or they might even end up employed by the financial industry to lobby their former colleagues – where a reputation for “seriousness” is a prerequisite, no matter how much damage those policies have caused. (Indeed, Osborne has done both.)

Sociology partly explains the Conservative embrace of austerity. But there was also political calculation. Denunciations of debt and deficits often go hand in hand with demands for smaller government, in particular a shrunken welfare state. In effect, politicians whose real goal is to move policy to the right exploit fear of deficits to push an agenda that would be deeply unpopular if stated openly. The Oxford economist Simon Wren-Lewis calls this the “deficit deceit” hypothesis. The deceit aspect is especially obvious in the US, where Republican leaders routinely denounce deficits while pushing for budget-busting tax cuts. But there is every reason to believe that the same kind of cynicism played an important role in UK austerity.

It turns out, however, that exploiting debt fears to engineer cuts in public spending tends not to work out quite the way that small-government advocates hope.

What serious conservatives – they do exist – want is a less generous social safety net, with fewer income transfers to households, while governments concentrate on those functions that only government can perform. I do not share that desire, but never mind. What is important is that voters do not share that desire: cutting direct financial aid is deeply unpopular.

What does this have to do with deficit deceit? Even when a government manages to build support for spending cuts by scaring the public about debt and deficits, it generally finds itself shying away from spending cuts that will directly affect families’ incomes. Instead, it tries to save money by shortchanging public investment and public services, a strategy that seems preferable because the consequences of these spending cuts may not be all that visible in the short run.

But the effects of inadequate public investment cumulate over time, so that a fiscal strategy advertised as an exercise in responsibility ends up being deeply irresponsible, leading to crumbling infrastructure and deteriorating public services. This is how Cameron and Osborne’s error has compounded over the past decade.

Consider the NHS. I am clearly not an expert on the system, and I am sure that the NHS’s problems have multiple causes. But it is obvious to an outsider that direct public provision of healthcare, while it has major advantages, creates a special form of political vulnerability.

Compare the NHS with single-payer systems – including Medicare, which serves older Americans – in which the government pays the bills but does not employ the doctors or operate the hospitals. An attempt to save money by underfunding Medicare would provoke an immediate public outcry – in fact, false rumours of such a move created an outcry in 2010. But a government can underfund the NHS for years before the consequences become obvious to voters, and by that time the crisis can be very hard to fix.

To sum up: a decade ago, the main critique of austerity was macroeconomic – it was holding back recovery from the severe recession that followed the global financial crisis. And it did. But that was not the end of the story. Austerity also gradually undermined public services, including healthcare.

What will a Labour government do to reverse this damage? There are two reasons to worry it will fall short.

First, the era of Conservative austerity coincided with an era of low interest rates and substantial excess capacity, exactly the conditions under which Britain should have been investing in its future. The current environment is much less favourable.

Second, Labour’s stated plans lack any ambition to reverse austerity. In the US, the Biden administration came in with bold plans and managed to accomplish a significant fraction of them despite having only a razor-thin congressional majority. I am not hearing anything comparable from Labour, even though Keir Starmer seems on course to have political capital beyond the wildest dreams of US progressives.

I hope to be proved wrong. But right now it looks as though the shadow of austerity policies adopted in error 14 years ago will continue to darken Britain’s prospects for many years to come.","Though many bad decisions undoubtedly contributed, one central cause was the way David Cameron and George Osborne gratuitously embraced fiscal austerity when they came to power after the global financial crisis.
Britain was not the only nation turning to fiscal austerity in the face of high unemployment – Greece engaged in savage austerity, while Portugal, Spain, Italy and Ireland made large cuts, and fiscal policy in the US also turned contractionary.
What made the British case unique was that it was almost entirely an unforced error.
And suddenly the euro “debt” crisis faded away, with investors demanding much lower interest rates on the debt of Italy, Spain and so on.
But right now it looks as though the shadow of austerity policies adopted in error 14 years ago will continue to darken Britain’s prospects for many years to come.","['cuts', 'britain', 'wrecked', 'economic', 'error', 'policies', 'nations', 'unforced', 'crisis', 'debt', 'austerity', 'public', 'spending', 'fiscal']",https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/926fdf4daeea34c2e4f0479cbe92eb3c9593d1b9/0_0_3848_2308/master/3848.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=2686c548c3c1b2f4bcc8f93ce7b61474,True,view imag fullscreen composit guardian design teamgetti unless poll wild inaccur conserv parti head toward catastroph defeat come elect across rich world voter angri govern -

The Guardian,https://www.theguardian.com/business/article/2024/jun/26/it-doesnt-make-sense-why-us-tariffs-on-chinese-cleantech-risk-the-green-transition,2024-06-26,04:00:06 UTC,It doesn’t make sense: why US tariffs on Chinese cleantech risk the green transition | Jeffrey Frankel,"With historic heatwaves sweeping across the US and other parts of the northern hemisphere, June is expected to be the 13th consecutive month of record-breaking global temperatures. The primary cause, of course, is the enormous amount of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere. Despite the existential threat posed by rising atmospheric concentrations of greenhouse gases, emissions continue to increase at a faster pace than previously anticipated.

On one front, however, progress in the fight against the climate crisis has exceeded expectations. Amid the global shift from internal combustion engines to electric vehicles and the accelerated adoption of solar and wind power, demand for renewable energy is rapidly rising in the US and the EU.

This increased demand has been fuelled by significant declines in the real prices of solar panels, wind turbines, batteries, and EVs. In the US, this can be attributed in part to the clean-energy subsidies included in President Joe Biden’s Inflation Reduction Act and, more significantly, to low-cost Chinese imports.

Alarmingly, new tariffs imposed by the US and the EU on imports of solar panels, EVs, and other equipment, threaten to derail this progress. While estimating the cost of the clean energy transition is a difficult task, even conceptually, the global electricity sector alone is projected to require $3.5tn in capital investment annually between 2021 and 2050. Western countries have demanded that China pay its fair share of these costs, but their own trade policies are starkly at odds with their objectives.

Although the disproportionate targeting of cleantech imports from China dates back more than a decade, the trend accelerated significantly under former US president Donald Trump and has continued under Biden. In May, the Biden administration imposed a 100% tariff on Chinese EVs, along with new levies on a range of other Chinese goods, including solar cells and lithium-ion batteries.

These measures aim to protect American workers and critical domestic industries. But they risk undermining the administration’s climate agenda, particularly its efforts to raise the share of renewables to 100% of US electricity by 2035 and the share of EVs to 50% of new car sales by 2030.

The new US tariffs could extend beyond China’s national borders. In response to western tariffs, some Chinese manufacturers have moved to south-east Asia in recent years. Earlier this month, the US International Trade Commission decided to investigate claims by American solar-cell companies seeking to impose countervailing and anti-dumping duties on south-east Asian manufacturers. This decision comes despite opposition from US solar-power developers who rely on imported equipment for domestic production.

Meanwhile, the European Commission has imposed provisional tariffs on Chinese EVs after an eight-month investigation found that China’s “unfair subsidisation” of its EV industry undercuts EU competitors. The new EU tariffs, while not prohibitive, average 31%, which is substantially higher than the duties on conventional car imports from other trading partners.

To be sure, while historically low labour costs and economies of scale have helped reduce the price of Chinese solar panels and EVs, generous government subsidies – often in the form of cheap credit – have also played a significant role. But it remains unclear how blocking these low-cost imports, as many western politicians propose, would benefit workers and consumers in the US and the EU. Do American and European policymakers prefer that their own taxpayers, instead of Chinese citizens, bear the costs of clean-energy subsidies? Recall that western countries wanted China to pay its fair share of the energy transition.

Admittedly, promoting climate policies by emphasising their potential to create green jobs for domestic workers could be an effective political strategy. But we should recognise that these arguments are political, not economic.

Although US tariffs may help create jobs in the solar-panel industry, those would be offset by job losses in the solar-energy installation sector, which relies on low-cost equipment. Similarly, some EV production jobs would disappear if tariffs led to higher prices for battery imports. Meanwhile, many export jobs would be cut when China and other countries inevitably retaliate against western restrictions.

With US unemployment at 4%, policymakers and voters are now more concerned about inflation than jobs. Removing tariffs is the surest way for western governments to lower energy and transportation prices, thereby reducing inflation. This is yet another example of how international trade could lower the costs of the clean-energy transition – if we were to embrace it.

Business leaders have criticized his remarks on “corporate greed” and his appearance on a union picket line. They chafe at the actions of officials he has appointed — particularly the head of the Federal Trade Commission, Lina Khan, who has moved to block a series of corporate mergers.

The prime-time bout, organized by CNN and simulcast on more than a dozen networks, was easily the most-viewed moment of the 2024 presidential campaign, the sort of mass civic gathering that is increasingly rare in a choose-your-own-news era of media. And the figure released on Friday by Nielsen, which mostly measures traditional TV sets, did not include the likely millions more who watched on digital news sites and social media platforms.

The size of the TV audience — similar to that for an N.F.L. conference championship game — could be grim news for the Biden campaign, given the shaky and stumbling performance by the president, which set off panic in the upper echelons of the Democratic Party.

But viewership was also down 30 percent from the first Biden-Trump debate in September 2020, which notched more than 73 million viewers. Nielsen said Thursday’s matchup in Atlanta was the lowest-rated general-election debate since the final meeting of George W.

After a bruising 90-minute debate that underscored President Biden’s single-biggest weakness — concern about his age — Democratic donors exchanged panicked texts and emails with one question: What’s Plan B?

The 81-year-old Biden’s halting, shaky performance against a confident (if sometimes misleading) showing by Donald Trump has set off alarm among Democrats with just seven weeks before the Democratic National Convention and four months before the November election.

Some party faithful who were suppressing their doubts about Biden are now privately lobbying Democratic leaders and scouring rule books to figure out how to change the presidential ticket.

All eyes will be on CNN at 9 p.m. Eastern, when President Biden and Donald Trump face off in their first debate since 2020. Among the keenest watchers will be executives and investors looking for signs about how the candidates might handle the economy and business in a second term.

There will be plenty to scrutinize in the 90-minute, audience-free debate, including what the candidates say and how they say it. Here’s what we will be looking out for. (And, for a lighter take, check out our debate “bingo card” further below.)

The economy is the big question. Various measures show strong growth under Biden, but many voters feel differently. What will Biden and Trump say about some of the key issues?

Inflation: This is clearly a challenge for the president, as Americans complain about what they’re paying in the grocery store, at the pump and on their rent. Biden can say that price increases are slowing down, and will most likely emphasize his administration’s efforts to crack down on “corporate greed,” like taking on so-called junk fees. Trump will probably stress how good things were when he took office in 2017 — an economy many Americans want back.

Taxes: Biden’s proposals for higher corporate taxes will hit profits: “It’s simple math,” David Bahnsen, the founder and chief investment officer of the Bahnsen Group, told DealBook. Many business leaders don’t like Biden’s plan to increase taxes on the wealthy, either. Trump will probably stress his desire to extend his 2017 tax cuts and lower the corporate rate to 20 percent. But questions about corporate earnings and the economy may eclipse those concerns.

Protectionism: Both candidates want to increase tariffs on Chinese goods, but Biden has been more targeted in how he has done it during his presidency. Trump has proposed significantly higher across-the-board levies, though it’s unclear how serious he is about it. Economists have warned that Trump’s potential approach could aggravate inflation and hurt the economy.

Markets: The S&P 500 set 31 records this year; investors will hope neither party messes with that momentum. In Thursday night’s debate, “markets probably care more about presentation than policy pledges,” Paul Donovan, an economist at UBS, wrote in a client note. Biden may have a slight edge, he added, since investors would prefer keeping “some continuity.”

Other issues will probably feature prominently. Biden will most likely raise abortion rights, a topic that has helped Democrats win in recent elections. Trump will almost certainly speak a lot about immigration, perhaps his most potent issue — and one that many, including Elon Musk, say is a failure of Biden’s.

The intangibles will matter. Executives told DealBook that C.E.O.s will be paying attention to how Biden and Trump perform:

For Biden, 81, an important issue for business leaders and many voters is whether he is still fit to serve. A sharp, forceful performance could go a ways in quieting any concerns.

For Trump, 78, competence is a question as well. But his demeanor will also be under scrutiny, especially if he comes across as overly abrasive or erratic. Some executives said their feelings would come down to whether they can stomach another four years of a Trump presidency.

There’s also the show around the show. Trump has suggested that his potential running mate would be in Atlanta for the debate. The Times reports that his list is narrowing, with Senator J.D. Vance of Ohio, Gov. Doug Burgum of North Dakota and Senator Marco Rubio of Florida being of particular interest.","Talking pointsAll eyes will be on CNN at 9 p.m. Eastern, when President Biden and Donald Trump face off in their first debate since 2020.

BBC Qcells is investing billions in a solar panel factory in Georgia

The former “carpet capital of the world” is getting a multi-billion-dollar makeover. Here in the rural Georgian town of Dalton, once known for its fabric floor coverings, a Korean company called Qcells is spending $2.5bn (£2bn) to expand its solar panel factory, with another in the works. It's a bold initiative that will create 2,500 quality jobs in the next 12 months, in an area where the average household income is roughly 27% below the national average. It is hoped the project will revitalise a corner of the US whose glory days seemed over. And it's due in no small part to someone many of the residents of this Republican district would rather not credit - Joe Biden. The president's landmark 2022 Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) – his signature green legislation - offered hundreds of billions of dollars in tax incentives, credits and loans to stimulate American manufacturing in clean energy.

The most ambitious climate legislation in US history has generated a tsunami of private sector investments, with big implications for the rest of the world. And Georgia - a state President Biden hopes is in play in this year’s presidential election - has been a big beneficiary. But with four months before the president goes head-to-head against Donald Trump, the billions of dollars of new investment in this key battleground state doesn’t appear to have lifted the incumbent’s support. President Biden’s pitch is that solving the climate problem is also good for jobs. Since the law was passed, more than 300,000 clean energy jobs have been created in the US, according to the advocacy group Climate Power. And there's no doubt it’s creating opportunities in places like Dalton. Here you see Bidenomics in action - foreign and government money being used to fight climate change and build an economy from the middle out.

Qcells' Scott Moskowitz points to the massive investments in US renewables

Scott Moskowitz, head of market strategy for Qcells, says that Georgia had been a great home since 2019, but that the IRA had been an “accelerant”. Without it, he muses, the current expansion might not have happened at all. “What our industry has seen, since the IRA has passed, is more investment in the past two years in solar and clean energy manufacturing than the previous 20 years,” he says. And yet that message either isn't getting through or simply isn't resonating with locals – not even local Democrats. Jan Pourquoi, the spokesperson for the local Whitfield County Democratic Party, tells me: “In the business community, there is a resentment against that company [Qcells].” Mr Pourquoi, a Belgian expat should know. He owns one of the small carpet firms in town. We spoke in his office, overlooking the factory floor where they turn flooring remnants into small rugs. “The business community resents the fact that we have a company from South Korea coming in this area with government subsidies, while they themselves get nothing from the government,” says Mr Pourquoi, who identified as a Republican before switching parties following Trump’s election in 2016. He tells me that local voters know little about the IRA law. “Nobody cares about clean energy, not around here. That is the type of stuff that I would call the ‘latte liberals’ care about in the big city.”

Qcells Qcells has been expanding its vast factory in Dalton

Well, at least one person does, and that's Marjorie Taylor Greene, the firebrand Republican congressional representative for the district. She has touted Qcells' expansion, despite voting against the law that helped make it possible. It’s creating some awkward dynamics for Republicans. The IRA is in Donald Trump’s sights. If Republican lawmakers win big in the Congressional elections that are also taking place on 5 November, then portions of President Biden’s signature climate law could be repealed, threatening a clean energy boom happening in their communities across the US. I sat down for coffee with Kasey Carpenter, Dalton’s Republican member in the Georgia House of Representatives. We met at Oakwood Café, the bustling diner he owns along with a string of other local businesses, including a pizza joint and a boutique hotel. Mr Carpenter downplayed the potential impact on Qcells of manufacturing tax credits being rolled back. He doesn’t think it would jeopardise the solar investments in his district. But he adds that if clean energy investments were to become at risk “I’m sure we’ll be speaking with the Trump team”. Our conversation ends with him saying it would be another feather in Dalton’s cap if this carpet town could also lay claim to the title of “solar panel capital of the world”.

But that belongs to China, which controls 80% of the world’s solar panel supply chain. For years China has been investing heavily in renewable energy, and is expected to spend a staggering $675bn in 2024, according to an International Energy Agency (IEA) report. To compete, governments around the world have begun throwing hundreds of billions at the green industries of the future. In the EU, investment in clean energy is set to increase to $370bn in 2024, according to the IEA. The predicted figure for the US is $315bn. US Trade Representative Katherine Tai said last year that she hoped the US’s increased spending on renewable energy would help address the “significant distortion” in the global economy caused by China.
