CNN —

Remember when Kate Moss wore wellies (that’s rain boots for those outside the UK) to Glastonbury?

As the historic festival once again returns to Worthy Farm, we look back at one of its most memorable fashion moments. After all, no British summer would be complete without copious amounts of mud.

And no one has conquered it quite like Moss.

Some 19 years ago, Britain’s best-known supermodel broke fashion’s proverbial fourth wall and joined the mortals in their muddy squalor. Sure, she’d probably spent the weekend glamping in the festival’s VIP zone. But a filthy field is England’s great leveler – and during those brief, well-photographed walks through the Glastonbury grounds, cigarette in hand, she was just like us.

Until, that is, her choice of practical footwear transformed festival fashion and helped save a heritage boot maker from the brink of obsolescence.

It was the summer of 2005 and Moss was near the height of her powers. Media interest in her festival whereabouts was amplified by a fixation with her then-nascent dalliance with Pete Doherty. But while The Libertines’ frontman certainly looked more at home in the conditions, it was Moss who grabbed the limelight.

Matching a pair of classic black Hunter rain boots with a waistcoat, short shorts and studded belt (and later a glittering tunic), the model was a picture of understated glamor. Below the knee her look was interchangeable with that of a Somerset pig farmer. But above it, she could just have easily emerged from a Chelsea mansion to a well-placed paparazzi ambush.

The images quickly went viral (or as viral as they could in the pre-social media age). The bastion of mid-1990s so-called “heroin chic” had become the face of its slightly older, more respectable cousin: mid-2000s festival chic.

In the process, wellies secured their place in the popular imagination. No longer the preserve of agriculture, they had become a rubbery status symbol best matched with trilby hats, cravats and other questionable noughties accessories. This once-practical boot had morphed into bourgeois badge of honor indicating that the wearer was prepared to “rough it” and still look fabulous (the drug-afflicted rockstar boyfriend remained an optional part of the look).

Suddenly, festival wear became its own category of clothing, something far greater than an amalgam of items you didn’t mind ruining. But an even more profound transformation was also taking place – that of the then-struggling Hunter Boot Limited.

The Scottish brand’s true heyday may have been during the World Wars, when it produced huge quantities of waterproof boots for the front lines. But never before in the company’s then 149-year history had its sensible footwear been so desirable. While one shouldn’t overstate the power of the Moss effect (her endorsement couldn’t save the boot maker from entering administration in 2006), it helped set in motion a remarkable turnaround in the company’s fortunes.

By 2007, the firm was under new ownership and reporting an 85% increase in year-on-year sales. It has since become a bona fide festival fixture, producing rainwear, outerwear and boots in all manner of colors and styles.

Once prized for keeping gangrene at bay in the trenches, Hunter has completed the ultimate 21st-century transformation to become the rainy-day boot de jour for celebrities from Rita Ora to Rihanna, Cara Delevingne to Alexa Chung.

And to think that all Kate wanted was a pair of snug, dry feet.","CNN —Remember when Kate Moss wore wellies (that’s rain boots for those outside the UK) to Glastonbury?

CNN —

The teenage cousin of the gunman responsible for the 2022 Uvalde, Texas, school shooting was arrested Monday on suspicion of threatening to “do the same thing” to a school, according to court documents obtained by CNN.

Nathan James Cruz, 17, was arrested on a felony charge of making a terroristic threat to a public place and a misdemeanor charge of making a terroristic threat against a family member, according to Bexar County Central Magistrate records.

Nathan James Cruz Bexar County Sheriff's Office

Cruz is the cousin of Salvador Ramos, the 18-year-old who fatally shot 19 children and two teachers at Robb Elementary School in May 2022, San Antonio police Sgt. Washington Moscoso told the New York Times on Monday.

CNN has sought comment from San Antonio police.

Ramos stormed into Robb Elementary last year armed with an assault rifle and tactical vest and opened fire on two adjoining classrooms – perpetrating one of the deadliest school shootings in modern US history. Law enforcement’s response has been heavily scrutinized, as officers waited outside the classrooms for more than an hour before entering and fatally shooting Ramos.

Cruz’s mother contacted police on Monday after her daughter reported that Cruz said he planned to “do the same thing” as his cousin, according to an affidavit obtained by CNN.

His mother told investigators she was “especially concerned because the suspect is currently on probation, was intoxicated at the time” and because the family lives across the street from an elementary school, the affidavit states.

Cruz’s sister told investigators that while she was giving her brother a ride, he “threatened to shoot her in the head and stated he would ‘shoot the school,’” according to the affidavit.

The mother allegedly overheard a phone conversation in which Cruz was attempting to illegally acquire an AR-15-style assault rifle – the same style used by Ramos to carry out the Uvalde shooting, according to the affidavit.

Following his arrest, Cruz “denied making any threats” when interviewed by a detective, the document states.

CNN has been unable to confirm whether Cruz has an attorney. His charges carry a combined $160,000 bond, according to the magistrate records.","Editor’s Note: (6/27/24) Since this story was published in August 2023, the case against Nathan James Cruz was dismissed due to a missing witness, according to court records in Bexar County, Texas.

Air traffic, extreme weather The Federal Aviation Administration has found a shortage of up to 3,000 needed air traffic controllers. Last summer, a record-breaking summer for airports, there were air traffic jams and near collisions amid challenges in flight coordination. Based on air traffic patterns and airport density, New York City and Florida are subject to the highest risk of backups. The massive heat wave across the U.S. was a peek at the kind of extreme weather that can lead to travel issues. The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration expects disruptive weather for the holiday week, with storms across the Midwest and East Coast, and continuing dangerous heat in the Southwest and interior Northeast. Extreme temperatures cause technical failures that result in delays. High heat creates thin air, which hampers the plane's thrust for takeoff and ascent. That means airplanes need more runway for takeoff or a lighter aircraft — by removing baggage or passengers. And it means that very high temperatures increase the risk of flight cancellations. The best bet to avoid this risk is to take early morning and late-night flights. Good news to reduce travel anxiety If travelers prepare and secure backup plans, they can make the best out of the busy summer season. And despite travel anxiety and a cascade of uncertain factors, travel expert and managing editor at The Points Guy, Clint Henderson, says airlines and airports are so far showing signs of being better prepared than past years. Despite May issues and despite some airlines pulling back on overall hiring plans compared to past years, in part due to Boeing delays, Henderson said, ""We have not seen the major meltdowns that we saw a couple of years ago. And I think part of the reason for that is the airlines and the airports, and everyone from Uber to rental car companies, you know, you name it, everyone staffed back up.""

United Airlines has projected a 7% increase in flyers from the 2023 Independence Day week, and is adapting with new staff. American Airlines is slated for 10% more summer departures year over year. Improvements in coordination for air traffic controllers are also taking place. ""The federal government and local ATC towers have been working together better, and that includes the military. They've opened up military airspace to help accommodate the crowd, so we have seen snarls,"" Henderson said. ""There is still a shortage of air traffic controllers, but it hasn't led to the worst outcomes that we were expecting when we were talking about the shortage of air traffic control workers even a year ago."" That said, he warns that in severe weather, a shortage of air traffic control may still worsen delays for travelers. Tips for Independence Day travel With lower-than-expected prices, many more flyers this summer are infrequent flyers, who should start by signing up for airline apps which may offer them some introductory benefits, starting with miles and extending to free WiFi on some flights. Henderson said the easiest ways to save hours of wait times include signing up for programs that offer passengers faster movement through security, including TSA PreCheck and Clear, as well as the no-application-required Mobile Passport Control app, which allows users to go through an expedited U.S. Customs lane. He also recommended the ""Flighty"" tracker app, or similar flight tracker, to stay on top of options in the event flight status changes. Flyers need to also stay on top of the routes that the planes they plan to take are already traveling on, to catch issues at other airports which could ultimately cause a cascade of cancellations. ""If your flight gets canceled, you're competing with all those people on that plane to get on the next available flight. So if you have a head start on those people, you're going to be the winner,"" Henderson said. When it comes to traveling during peak season, ""Information is power,"" he said. Cheaper airfares may not be here to stay Airfares are down, but many factors influence price, from the specific destination of a traveler, with wide variation in prices depending on route, to how far in advance tickets are purchased, midweek travel versus weekend dates, and what additional fees (e.g. baggage) may push up the total cost of travel significantly. In addition, with issues lingering in the supply of new planes, from Boeing production being curtailed by the FAA to Airbus running into supply chain snafus, the recent dip in fares may not last too long. Henderson eventually expects price hikes from airlines related to increasing maintenance costs and reduced fleet capacity. Labor costs and fuel costs per flight skyrocketed in the past year. With production delays, airlines pay billions to fly less fuel-efficient and more costly and aged jets. Technical issues are more common on older plans and increase delays as well. On June 26, Southwest Airlines cut its second-quarter revenue forecast while citing booking concerns. The firm announced a decline in expected revenue per seat per mile, and fuel costs increasing up to 7.5% year over year. But for now, even with rising costs, flight prices have yet to return to their summer 2023 peaks, and consumers are taking advantage. Henderson said many last-minute travel deals that airlines are offering this summer are still available. Even if the security lines are long, prices on many routes should not weigh travelers down. Hopefully, neither will delays and cancellations.","Last summer, a record-breaking summer for airports, there were air traffic jams and near collisions amid challenges in flight coordination.

The first round of a snap parliamentary election in France points to a surge in votes for the anti-immigrant National Rally party, with President Emmanuel Macron's centrist alliance coming into third place.

Early polling data from national broadcaster France 2 indicates that National Rally (RN) won 34% of the vote while the leftist New Popular Front (NFP) alliance got 28.1%. Macron's centrist Together bloc garnered 20.3%, according to initial projections, which are based on samples of actual results taken from polling stations that closed earlier in the afternoon.

Polling stations in large cities close later. A clearer picture of the results should emerge after 10 p.m. local time.

Candidates are only elected in the first round if they receive an absolute majority of votes and get more than 25% of the registered local electorate's support. If no candidate meets that standard, a second round of voting is held, listing the top two candidates and any other candidates who secured more than 12.5% of registered voters' support. The candidate that wins the largest number of votes then wins the seat.

The second round of voting on July 7 is the one to watch, according to Antonio Barroso, deputy director of Research at Teneo.

""First-round victories tend to say little about the overall results (absent a surprisingly high number of wins obtained by a specific party). This is why, beyond the overall percentage of votes for each party, the main issue to watch on Sunday night is how many candidates from each party will make it to the second round,"" he said in a note Wednesday.

""If, as expected, Together does poorly in the first round, there will be numerous races between the NFP and the RN.""

Ahead of the first ballot, French voter polls suggested the hard-right National Rally party would win around 35% of the vote in the election, followed by the leftist NFP alliance and then a coalition of pro- Macron parties in third place.

As such, National Rally is widely expected to significantly increase the number of seats it has in France's 577-seat parliament, the National Assembly, from the current level of 89.","The first round of a snap parliamentary election in France points to a surge in votes for the anti-immigrant National Rally party, with President Emmanuel Macron's centrist alliance coming into third place.

Disney and Pixar's ""Inside Out 2"" is the newest member of the billion-dollar club.

The animated feature has tallied $1.014 billion worldwide as of Sunday, making it the highest-grossing film of 2024 and the first film since Warner Bros.′ ""Barbie"" to top $1 billion at the global box office.

""On behalf of movie theatre owners across the country and around the world, we want to congratulate Disney's 'Inside Out 2' for grossing $1 billion faster than any animated movie in history,"" said Michael O'Leary, president and CEO of the National Association of Theatre Owners. ""The film's stunning global success once again illustrates that audiences the world over will respond to compelling, entertaining movies, and that they want to enjoy them on the big screen.""

The billion-dollar benchmark is a much-needed win for Disney's Pixar animation hub. A once prolifically successful studio, Pixar has suffered at the box office in the wake of the pandemic. Much of its difficulties have come, in part, because Disney opted to debut a handful of animated features directly on streaming service Disney+ during theatrical closures and even once cinemas had reopened.

As a result, before ""Inside Out 2,"" no Disney animated feature from Pixar or its Walt Disney Animation studio had generated more than $480 million at the global box office since 2019.

""Inside Out 2"" has also showcased how vital the family audience is to the box office. This underserved crowd accounted for more than 70% of those in attendance during the film's domestic debut, according to data from EntTelligence.

While this audience came out in droves for Universal's ""The Super Mario Bros. Movie,"" which generated more than $1.36 billion at the global box office, there was little for them to feast on until the recent releases of Sony's ""The Garfield Movie"" and Paramount's ""IF.""

""Inside Out 2"" also drove the coveted teen demographic to cinemas, with 14% of foot traffic coming from those aged 13 to 17. This younger generation has been largely absent from the market in recent years.

As the future of moviegoing, this group is particularly important to the industry. Getting them back to the big screen has become a top priority for studios and movie theater operators.

Next up for family and teens is Universal and Illumination's ""Despicable Me 4,"" due out in theaters during the July Fourth holiday weekend.

CNBC,https://www.cnbc.com/2024/06/30/democrats-defend-biden-debate-flop-voter-poll.html,2024-06-30,16:58:10 UTC,'Preparation overload': Democrats defend Biden after debate flop as voter support flinches,"Democrat candidate, U.S. President Joe Biden, and Republican candidate, former U.S. President Donald Trump, attend a presidential debate in Atlanta, Georgia, U.S., June 27, 2024.

Democrats are making the rounds on the Sunday media circuit working to reshape perceptions about President Joe Biden after he delivered a stumbling debate performance that left his voters cringing and his party in a damage-control frenzy.

""Yes, it was a bad performance,"" South Carolina's Democratic Rep. Jim Clyburn, a close Biden ally, said on CNN's ""State of the Union."" ""I know when I see what I call preparation overload. And that's exactly what was going on the other night.""

The South Carolina Democrat followed the post-debate spin formula that has emerged from Biden supporters since the Thursday showdown: Acknowledge the fumble and then pivot to critiques of the presumptive Republican presidential nominee, former President Donald Trump.

""Joe Biden should continue to run on his record. I do believe that we will find him when contrasted with the record of the four years of Trump to be exactly what we need going forward,"" Clyburn said.

Former presidents Barack Obama and Bill Clinton followed that structure in similar arguments on Friday.

House Democratic Leader Hakeem Jeffries, Sen. Chris Coons, D-Del., Sen. Raphael Warnock, D-Ga. and former House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., also jumped to Biden's defense on the Sunday media junket.

Despite the full-court press, Biden's Thursday debate performance, marked by several instances where he tripped over his words or trailed off mid-answer, has only amplified voter concerns about his age and fitness to carry out a second presidential term.

A new CBS News/YouGov poll taken between June 28 and June 29 found that 72% of registered voters surveyed do not think Biden should run for president, up from 63% in February. The poll also found that 72% of the respondents do not think that Biden has the mental and cognitive ability to serve as president, a seven percent increase since June 9.

A poll taken so shortly after a major event like Thursday's debate represents a knee-jerk reaction. A more accurate snapshot of public sentiment may emerge as the initial hype dies down and voters have more time to process. The CBS News poll surveyed 1,130 registered voters and had a margin of error of +/- 4.2%.

But those new numbers come in direct tension with Biden's argument that voters are not as down on his debate blunders as much as political pundits.

""I understand the concern about the debate. I get it. I didn't have a great night. But here's what [is] not getting reported: Voters had a different reaction than the pundits,"" the president said at a Saturday campaign event in East Hampton, N.Y. ""Since the debate, polls show a little movement, and we've moved us up, actually.""

Biden and Trump are scheduled for a second debate on Sept. 10, though it is unclear whether both candidates will follow through.

Ultimately, the debate has triggered a Democratic reckoning over whether Biden should remain the presumptive nominee.

Some Democratic strategists, along with newspaper editorial boards across the country have suggested he should step down and forfeit his delegates ahead of August's Democratic National Convention to allow someone else to take on Trump in November.

Biden is at Camp David on Sunday, joined by his family where he is expected to discuss the path forward of his reelection bid, according to NBC News.

In the meantime, the Biden campaign has been raking in large fundraising hauls in the wake of the debate. As of Sunday morning, the campaign had raised $33 million since Thursday, $26 million of which came from grassroots donors, according to Biden campaign spokesperson Kevin Munoz.

Munoz added that nearly half of that grassroots funding came from donors giving money to the campaign for the first time this election season.","Democrat candidate, U.S. President Joe Biden, and Republican candidate, former U.S. President Donald Trump, attend a presidential debate in Atlanta, Georgia, U.S., June 27, 2024.
""Yes, it was a bad performance,"" South Carolina's Democratic Rep. Jim Clyburn, a close Biden ally, said on CNN's ""State of the Union.""

The largest utility companies in the U.S. are warning that the nation is facing a surge of electricity demand unlike anything seen in decades, and failure to rapidly increase power generation could jeopardize the nation's economy. After a more than decade-long period of largely flat growth, electricity demand is poised to skyrocket by 2030 as the artificial intelligence revolution, the expansion of chip manufacturing, and the electrification of the vehicle fleet all coincide as the U.S. is trying to address climate change. The tech sector's build out of data centers to support AI and the adoption of electric vehicles alone is expected to add 290 terawatt hours of electricity demand by the end of the decade, according to a report released by the consulting firm Rystad Energy this week. The expected demand from data centers and electric vehicles in the U.S. is equivalent to the entire electricity demand of Turkey, the world's 18th largest economy, according to Rystad. ""This growth is a race against time to expand power generation without overwhelming electricity systems to the point of stress,"" said Surya Hendry, a Rystad analyst, in a release following the report's publication.

'The stakes are really, really high'

The major tech players – Amazon , Alphabet's Google unit, Microsoft and Meta – are urgently requesting more power as they bring data centers online that in some cases require a gigawatt of electricity, said Petter Skantze, vice president of infrastructure development at NextEra Energy Resources. To put that in context, a gigawatt is equivalent to the capacity of nuclear reactor. NextEra Energy , parent of Skantze's subsidiary, is the largest power company in the S&P utilities sector by market capitalization and it operates the biggest portfolio of renewable energy assets in the nation. ""This is a different urgency coming. They need this load to drive the next iteration of growth,"" Skantze told the Reuters Global Energy Transition conference in New York City this week. ""They're showing up now at the utility and they're banging on the door and they're saying I need to put this resource on the grid,"" the executive said.

A big challenge will be whether enough resources are available to connect those large data center projects to the power grid, Skantze said. The stakes are high for the U.S. economy, the executive said. ""If I can't get that power capacity online, I cannot do the data center. I cannot do the manufacturing. I can't grow the core businesses of some of the largest corporations in the country,"" Skantze said. ""The stakes are really, really high. This is a new environment. We have to get this right."" NextEra CEO John Ketchum told investors earlier this month that U.S. power demand will increase by 38% over the next two decades, a fourfold increase over the annual rate of growth in the previous 20 years. NextEra expects much of the demand to be met by renewables and battery storage, Ketchum said. The company has a 300-gigawatt pipeline of renewable and storage projects.

'Energy security brings national security'

Southern Company , the second-largest utility in the U.S. by market cap, is also seeing a historic wave of electricity demand. The power company is headquartered in Atlanta, one of the fastest growing data center markets in the U.S. with 723 gigawatts under construction in 2023, up 211% over the prior year, according to real estate services firm CBRE. Southern Company CEO Chris Womack said the company is seeing a level of demand not seen since the advent of air conditioning and heat pumps in the South in the 1970s and 1980s. The utility is expecting demand to grow by three or four times, he said. ""A lot of this is dependent and contingent upon what we see with artificial intelligence and all those large learning models and what data centers will consume,"" Womack said. ""You're also seeing in the Southeast, this incredible population growth and you're seeing all this onshoring with manufacturing."" Supplying the demand with reliable power is a matter of economic and national security, Womack said. Southern expects 80% of the demand through the end of the decade to be met by renewables, he said.","The expected demand from data centers and electric vehicles in the U.S. is equivalent to the entire electricity demand of Turkey, the world's 18th largest economy, according to Rystad.

CNBC,https://www.cnbc.com/2024/06/28/amazon-doubling-value-of-credits-for-startups-to-build-on-aws-cloud.html,2024-06-29,01:58:14 UTC,Amazon is doubling value of credits for some startups to build on AWS as Microsoft cloud gains ground,"Attendees walk through an expo hall at AWS re:Invent, a conference hosted by Amazon Web Services, at the Venetian in Las Vegas on Nov. 28, 2023.

Amazon will double the value of credits it offers some startups to use its cloud infrastructure, CNBC has learned, as the company faces heightened competition from Microsoft in artificial intelligence services.

Starting July 1, startups that have raised a Series A round of funding in the past year will be eligible for $200,000 in credits through AWS' Activate program, up from $100,000 before, the Amazon cloud unit said in an email to venture capitalists this week. Seed-stage startups will still be eligible for $100,000 in credits, AWS said.

Two people briefed on the changes confirmed the credit increase, though they asked not to be named because the information is private.

Matt Garman, who was recently promoted to CEO of AWS after running sales and marketing, was meeting with founders in Silicon Valley this week, the people said. Garman told the execs that collaborating with startups would always be a primary focus, one of the people said, adding that Garman described AI companies as AWS' ideal customers.

An AWS spokesperson confirmed the increase in credits and Garman's visit to Silicon Valley. The spokesperson added that in the past, the $100,000 would expire in one year, while the $200,000 credit will now expire in three years.

Amazon, which is best known for its massive online retail operation, derives most of its profit from AWS, a business it launched in 2006, well before rivals Microsoft and Google hit the scene. AWS leads the market, with $25 billion in revenue in the first quarter, up 17% from a year earlier.

But Microsoft Azure and Google Cloud are growing more quickly, and are benefiting from rapidly advancing AI models. Backed by Microsoft, OpenAI launched ChatGPT in late 2022 on Azure, and has since attracted a wave of AI workloads to Microsoft from companies big and small. Google has a number of large language models, most notably Gemini.

Amazon has been trying to catch up in generative AI and has poured billions of dollars into OpenAI challenger Anthropic.

Last month, AWS CEO Adam Selipsky announced his resignation after three years running the business, with Garman named as his successor. During Selipsky's time at the helm, Microsoft and Google increased their share of the cloud infrastructure market. One analyst told CNBC that Microsoft ""ran laps around"" AWS in generative AI.

Startups have long been fertile ground for cloud infrastructure companies, as they try and lure ambitious founders who could be building the next multibillion-dollar business.

In November, Microsoft announced a partnership with Silicon Valley accelerator Y Combinator that would provide participating startups with $350,000 in Azure credits and access to graphics processing units (GPUs) for training AI models, a spokesperson said. Microsoft has since extended the $350,000 credit incentive to other accelerators, including the AI Grant.

Startups enrolled in Microsoft's Founders Hub program, which doesn't require previous venture funding, can receive up to $150,000 in Azure credits over four years.

In addition to its Activate offering, Amazon has a new 10-week generative AI accelerator program. Participants will be able to access up to $1 million in cloud credits, according to the website.

Earlier on Friday, Amazon's head scientist, Rohit Prasad, told employees that the company has hired David Luan, co-founder and CEO of AI startup Adept, along with some of Luan's colleagues. ""Amazon is also licensing Adept's agent technology, family of state-of-the-art multimodal models, and a few datasets,"" Adept said in a blog post.

There's an army of unsponsored athletes commanding attention at the U.S. Track & Field Olympic Trials this year, decked out in all-black, logo-less gear.

The 35 athletes are supported by apparel company Bandit Running's Unsponsored Project, an effort to challenge the standard sponsorship model for professional athletes and boost up-and-coming competitors.

Unsponsored athletes in track and field would typically purchase their own apparel bearing the emblems of major brands, effectively providing free advertising for the companies. Instead, Bandit Running offers Olympic hopefuls the all-black kits and warmups — along with short-term endorsement deals.

Bandit co-founder Tim West said the company is giving out at least 35 two-week deals for unsponsored runners at the trials, a U.S. Olympian's gateway into the four-year games. The deals consist of unbranded apparel, a platform and cash to cover expenses. Last year, Bandit partnered with nine athletes.

""We're really hoping for a new sponsorship model where brands take a healthy piece of their budget and apply it to the kind of amateur, sub-elite athlete to help grow the sport. I think when you lift up, sort of the bottom, everything pushes up,"" West told CNBC.

Bandit's deals have a built-in release clause, West said, allowing an easy out for athletes who get a traditional sponsorship offer during the trials.

Given the high prices associated with competing, West said unsponsored athletes are ""investing in themselves,"" posing an opportunity for brands to step in and help out.

And, the all-black, logo-free kits help call attention to which athletes may be available to strike a longer-term deal.

Among them is Courtney Okolo, a 400-meter runner.

After winning a gold medal in the 2016 Rio Olympics and being sponsored by Nike for four years, Okolo, 30, is embracing the Unsponsored Project. She said getting support while competing without a sponsorship is difficult, but Bandit's initiative makes it feel like she isn't doing it all on her own.","Christopher Royster, left, and JT Smith, athletes who participate in Bandit Running's Unsponsored Project, at the 2024 Olympic trials in Eugene, Oregon.

HANGZHOU, China — Apple 's mixed-reality headset began deliveries in China on Friday with a retail price roughly 18% higher than in the U.S.

The device starts at 29,999 yuan, or $4,128, in China, compared to a $3,500 retail price in the U.S.

When asked by CNBC, a customer surnamed Chen in Beijing said his suggestion to Apple CEO Tim Cook was to make Vision Pro cheaper by about 10,000 yuan, or $1,376. The customer, who did not share his first name due to concerns about speaking with foreign media, said many people in China might prefer to buy a secondhand Vision Pro because of the discounted price that typically comes with purchases from sellers unaffiliated with Apple.

Many of the most popular posts about the device on Chinese social media platform Weibo on Friday focused on the hashtag ""is it worth paying for the China version of Vision Pro,"" according to a CNBC translation.

CNBC has reached out to Apple for comment.

Greater China accounted for about 18% of Apple's revenue in the three months that ended March 30, according to an Apple filing.

Over the past year, Apple has faced growing competition from Huawei devices and other domestic brands, amid greater attention on national security.

Chen preordered his Vision Pro and was at a major store in Beijing to pick it up and receive some training on how to use it.

Store salespeople told CNBC that all of Friday's half-hour training sessions for preorders of the Vision Pro were booked up at Apple stores in Beijing — from 8 a.m. to 10 p.m.

Chinese companies such as Tencent, Alibaba and JD.com have launched Vision Pro versions of their apps for shopping, playing games and watching videos.","The Apple Vision Pro mixed-reality headset is on sale at the Apple flagship store in Hangzhou, Zhejiang Province of China, on June 28, 2024.

CEOs say borderless talent is the future of tech work","To work remotely or not is no longer the question. Experts say it's borderless hiring for technology roles that is stealing the conversation.

""Remote is like the gateway drug to borderless,"" said Jeremy Johnson, CEO of AI-enabled tech talent marketplace Andela, whose customers include Goldman Sachs, Github and Coursera. ""Once you realize that you don't have to all be in the same office five days a week in order to build a compelling culture and feel connected to the mission and solve complex problems, you then start thinking there are great people all over the world.""

With tech leaders focusing concurrently on innovation and value-driven efficiency, tech hiring that eclipses national or even global time zone delineation is a growing phenomenon. Borderless tech hiring has doubled in the last three years, according to Gartner's 2023 CEO Survey. By 2022, the tech talent workforce in cities like Beijing and Delhi far outweighed that of U.S. powerhouses like San Francisco and New York, reports CBRE Global Tech Talent Guidebook 2024. The report cites burgeoning tech talent markets like Bucharest, Romania; Cape Town, South Africa; Cebu City, Philippines; Nairobi, Kenya and more.

Global hiring is an example of a luxury that's moving down the value chain, Johnson said. Much like services such as Uber increased access to what is essentially a private driver on demand, talent marketplaces and a digitized workforce make global hiring more than just a pricey C-suite search.

Global payment processing platform Payoneer has its hands in the borderless hiring world from an internal perspective (with about 2,200 employees in 50 countries and more than 25 offices globally), but it also benefits from and drives the borderless trend with its clients.

""The rhetoric about the globalized opportunity is powerful, but it doesn't make any difference to the business you're doing unless you actually have the utilities and tools to do it,"" said Payoneer CEO John Caplan.

Pockets of talent worldwide

Adam Jackson, CEO of decentralized tech talent platform Braintrust, does borderless differently. ""We don't have a physical office,"" he said. ""Everyone works remotely. Every engineer but one who works on Braintrust is outside of the U.S."" Braintrust's clients, from NASA to Nestlé, are building borderless teams, too, Jackson says.

""It was the case maybe 20 years ago when I moved to San Francisco that the best tech, best developers, best product managers and designers all lived here in Silicon Valley,"" Jackson added. ""That's just not true anymore. There are still many here, but there are pockets all over the world.""

Some leaders, like Johnson, believe time zone coordination is still important to provide certain employees with the opportunity to work synchronously. Jackson, however, has the viewpoint that global innovation with an asynchronous workforce is a chance to create a company ""where the sun never sets.""

While there are questions about work-life balance, Jackson says that doesn't exist in startup culture anyway, but that asynchronous work can increase clarity in documentation and minimize the endless treadmill of meetings, leaving more time for creative thinking and deep work.

Johnson says local labor laws, compliance and payroll are all factors at play in global operations, which is why many organizations have opened centers in specific countries. But even these obstacles aren't insurmountable.

AI and future of work geographies

One thing these experts agree on is that there's no one-size-fits-all approach to borderless hiring. ""Every company has to find their own bespoke solution,"" Caplan said. ""You have to design your office footprint, your future-of-work philosophy to the business you're building.""

Thinking about artificial intelligence innovation and, on the flip side of the same coin, AI regulation, Johnson says the European Union's standard-setting regulatory framework will make it tough for tech operations to thrive. As more regulatory and case law settles around the globe surrounding AI and data, cross-border employment trends will shift like puzzle pieces.

""I think Europe is going to have a really tough time over the next few years,"" he said. ""They're pushing a lot of data innovation out of the continent, and I think that's an opportunity for Africa and Latin America and other parts of the world.""

Regardless of where organizations hire, Jackson emphasizes the importance of managing risk and hiring good people. ""Quality still matters,"" he said. ""The old adage is when you're building software, do you want to be fast, good quality, or cheap? Pick two. Now, I reject that. You can have all three, but quality still matters, no matter where you are.""

Caplan relishes in the more altruistic potential of borderless employment, namely its ability to ""lift up communities around the globe."" This may be true, but at the very least, its benefits for expanded talent reach and cost effectiveness are enough for leaders in all kinds of industries to take it on. With applications for standard work-sponsored visas in the U.S. up 263% in 2023 compared to the year prior, according to Deel's latest Tech Migration Report, and U.S. cities accounting for the top five average monthly apartment rent costs, borderless hiring could ease the burden for employment seekers and employment providers in one

""If you could make your single biggest expense, which is talent, 10% more efficient, you have a dramatic advantage,"" Johnson said. Borderless hiring, it seems, will continue to infiltrate the growth playbook at all levels.","Borderless tech hiring has doubled in the last three years, according to Gartner's 2023 CEO Survey.

CNBC,https://www.cnbc.com/2024/06/30/purchases-that-are-cheaper-than-last-year.html,2024-06-30,13:00:01 UTC,"From used cars to airfare: 5 purchases that are cheaper than last year, even as prices rise overall","Prices for commonly purchased items such as groceries and diapers keep going up — or at least it feels that way. But with inflation cooling off over the last year, a few things have actually gotten cheaper. The discounts are a welcome relief for Americans who have weathered the cost of goods and services increasing 17% over the past three years, as measured by the consumer price index. At 3.3%, the year-over-year inflation rate is still above the Federal Reserve's target of 2%, but price decreases are an encouraging sign that costs are trending in the right direction. Here's a look at the most significant discounts in the past year, expressed as percentages.

Used cars and trucks: -9.3%

Used cars and trucks epitomized pandemic-related inflation in 2021, with prices rising 40.5%, according to CPI data. Prices have since fallen and steadily declined over the past two years. The decline in prices is largely due to a glut of used cars on the market, which is basically the opposite of what happened during the Covid-19 pandemic. A used car worth $25,000 in 2023 would now sell for $22,675 — a $2,325 discount, based on CPI data.

Dishes and flatware: -8.1%

The cost of dishes and eating utensils is sensitive to home sales, as many people upgrade their kitchen supplies when they move. Fewer homes being sold is likely a factor in the reduced cost of dishes and flatware. Dishware is also easier to produce compared to other industries, so there is a large number of competitors, many of which slashed prices over the past year. You will often see big retail chains offering dinnerware sets as part of clearance sales.

Television prices have been trending downward over the past 12 months, after posting an 11.5% year-over-year drop as of May 2023. This reflects a longer-term trend of price declines, as TVs have become cheaper to produce. Another factor is that data collection from ""Smart TV"" interfaces generates revenue for manufacturers, which allows them to lower TV prices further.

Major appliances: -6.2%

Expect to find good deals on ovens, fridges, freezers, dishwashers and other large appliances, as prices have dropped 3.5% so far in 2024, following a 7.3% decline in 2023. Over the past 12 months, major appliance costs have declined 6.2%. This is due to several factors. Factory efficiencies have reduced production costs, making it easier for manufacturers to discount major appliances. The industry is also very competitive, which means discounts are common. Plus, the slowdown in the housing market discouraged sales, as people tend to buy appliances when they move into new homes.

Airline fares: -5.9%","Prices for commonly purchased items such as groceries and diapers keep going up — or at least it feels that way.

CNBC,https://www.cnbc.com/2024/06/30/top-wall-street-analysts-favor-these-dividend-stocks-for-better-returns.html,2024-06-30,10:55:21 UTC,Top Wall Street analysts favor these dividend stocks for better returns,"A sign is posted in front of an Olive Garden restaurant on June 20, 2024 in Rohnert Park, California.

Dividend-paying stocks can help investors bolster their portfolios and boost returns.

Investors searching for these names will need to find companies that have a track record of making steady payments, backed by robust financials.

Here are three attractive dividend stocks, according to Wall Street's top pros on TipRanks, a platform that ranks analysts based on their past performance.

Darden Restaurants

The first dividend stock is Darden Restaurants (DRI), which operates several popular brands in full-service dining, including Olive Garden, LongHorn Steakhouse and Yard House. The company recently announced mixed results for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2024. While Darden exceeded analysts' earnings expectations, its sales slightly missed the Street's consensus amid increased discounting by rivals.

Darden issued $628 million in dividends and committed $454 million to share repurchases in fiscal 2024. Moreover, the company announced a dividend hike of nearly 7%, bringing the quarterly dividend to $1.40 per share. The stock has a dividend yield of 3.5%.

Following the results, BTIG analyst Peter Saleh reiterated a buy rating on DRI stock with a price target of $175. The analyst highlighted that at the mid-point, Darden's earnings per share outlook of $9.40 to $9.60 indicates double-digit total shareholder return, which is in line with the company's long-term targets.

Saleh thinks that the company can achieve its targeted return metrics, supported by several factors, including a modest rise in pricing, advertising initiatives and easing inflation.

""We view Darden Restaurants as one of the strongest operators in the industry with historical sales and restaurant margin performance that has consistently exceeded peers,"" said Saleh.

Saleh ranks No. 360 among more than 8,900 analysts tracked by TipRanks. His ratings have been successful 61% of the time, with each delivering an average return of 11.7%. (See Darden's Financial Statements on TipRanks)

International Seaways

Next up is International Seaways (INSW), a tanker company that offers energy transportation services for crude oil and petroleum products. On June 26, the company paid a combined dividend of $1.75 per share. The company's combined dividend represented 60% of its first-quarter adjusted net income.

In its first-quarter results, INSW highlighted that its combined dividend payments of $5.74 per share over the last twelve months reflected a dividend yield of more than 13%.

Following meetings with INSW's management, Stifel analyst Benjamin Nolan reaffirmed a buy rating on the stock and increased the price target to $68 from $66. The analyst noted that the tanker market remains cyclically strong due to a continued increase in global oil consumption, the limited supply of new ships and the longer average voyage lengths caused by the ongoing geopolitical troubles.

Accordingly, Nolan increased his rate assumptions for 2024 and 2025. The analyst expects International Seaways to continue to deliver higher cash flows, fueled by a favorable backdrop for the tanker market.

Nolan expects INSW to sustain high supplemental dividends, given the estimated $200 million to $300 million of excess cash flow after capital expenditure (assuming there is no new debt associated with tanker acquisitions). ""We are modeling $5.51/share in 2024 dividends, although there is room to be a little higher,"" said the analyst.

Nolan ranks No. 68 among more than 8,900 analysts tracked by TipRanks. His ratings have been successful 67% of the time, with each delivering an average return of 19.5%. (See International Seaways' Stock Charts on TipRanks)

Citigroup

Finally, let's discuss this week's third dividend stock, banking giant Citigroup (C). At a quarterly dividend of 53 cents per share, Citigroup offers a yield of 3.3%.

The bank held its Services Investor Day on June 18. Management expressed confidence about achieving the 2024 guidance, driven by revenue growth across all the core businesses despite macro uncertainty and the possibility of lower interest rates.

Following the event, Goldman Sachs analyst Richard Ramsden reiterated a buy rating on Citigroup stock and slightly raised his price target to $72 from $71. The higher price target reflects an increase in the analyst's EPS estimates for 2024, 2025 and 2026 based on management's commentary, which indicated that the bank's strategic transformation plan is gaining momentum.

Ramsden noted that Citi is highly focused on its transformation efforts, with the bank making steady progress on risk control and data quality. Coming to the Services business, the analyst noted that management established strategic priorities for this vital component of the company's financial targets. The analyst estimates that the Services business will account for 25% of the group revenue growth through 2026.

""The Services business is well positioned to maintain their market leading positions with potential to continue share gains across businesses,"" said Ramsden. The analyst's optimism is based on Citi's extensive global network in 95 countries, well-established long-term client relationships, and market share gains that are expected to be driven by investments in technology and innovative offerings.

Ramsden ranks No. 969 among more than 8,900 analysts tracked by TipRanks. His ratings have been successful 65% of the time, with each delivering an average return of 11.9%.

The Economist Intelligence Unit (EIU) released its annual Global Liveability Index 2024, which evaluates cities worldwide for their livability. EIU's report examines 173 cities globally based on 30 indicators organized into five different categories: Stability

Health care

Culture and environment

Education and infrastructure The cities were then ranked on a 100-point scale. For the third year in a row, Vienna, Austria, ranked as the world's best city to live. On the opposite side of the world, not a single city in the U.S. ranked in the top 20 places to live. The report noted that a trend in the U.S. this year is smaller cities outperforming the bigger metropolitan areas. Two of the more popular cities in America, New York and Los Angeles didn't rank in the top 10 — they came in 70th and 58th, respectively.

Honolulu is the best U.S. city to live in

For the second year in a row, Honolulu ranked as the best U.S. city to live in, according to the EIU. It ranked 23 on the global list, up from No. 25 in 2023. The Hawaii city landed in the top spot because of its high scores in education, infrastructure, and stability compared to other U.S. cities.

Living in Honolulu also means living in a city in one of the most expensive states in the U.S., according to CNBC's America's Top States for Business study. It ranked highly based on an index of prices for a range of goods and services. The cost of living in Hawaii is high because of several factors, including the fact that so many items on the island are imported. According to that CNBC study, gas prices in the state are among the nation's highest. Honolulu is also the western metro area with the biggest rent increase for 1-bedroom apartments in a year. Rent in the area went up by 3.3% from $1,783 in 2023 to $1,841 in 2024, according to rent estimate data from Apartment List for April 2023 to April 2024, analyzed by CNBC Make It.

The Nasdaq was the big winner of the second quarter, adding 8.26% over the past three months thanks to an artificial intelligence-powered tech rally. The S & P 500 gained 3.92% since the end of March. The Dow, on the other hand, closed out the April through June period in the loss column — ending down 1.73%. The Dow is not as heavily weighted in tech, which was the top-performing sector in Q2. Here's a look at the three best second-quarter performers among the 33 stocks in the CNBC Investing Club portfolio and the three worst. Best Performers NVDA YTD mountain Nvidia YTD Nvidia continued to be the top-performing stock in the portfolio for the second quarter in a row, gaining 36.73%. The major contributor to the upside was a blowout fiscal 2025 first quarter accompanied by strong current quarter guidance. During the post-earnings call in May, the risk of a so-called air pocket in sales momentum as the company transitions to its new Blackwell chip architecture was taken off the table . Management said demand for the yet-to-be-released platform already outstrips supply. Last week, if only briefly, Nvidia became the most valuable U.S. company. After record high after record high, the stock pulled back recently. On Wednesday, at Nvidia's annual shareholders meeting, founder and CEO Jensen Huang took questions and laid out the company's overall strategy to maintain its lead position in enabling AI. AAPL YTD mountain Apple YTD The second big winner was Apple , which rose 22.82% in Q2. The stock didn't do much in the first month of the second quarter. However, all that changed in early May when the company reported solid earnings . Services revenue was better than expected and China was nowhere near as bad as feared. That got the stock going. But the real break out to all-time highs followed the company's AI announcements at this month's Worldwide Developers Conference. Shares took that other leg up, in our view, because Apple Intelligence will only be available on last year's iPhone 15 Pro models or better. That means the vast majority of iPhone users, who we know to be extremely loyal to the brand, have a better reason than ever before to upgrade their devices. We expect many to do so. AVGO YTD mountain Broadcom YTD Broadcom came in third and saw its stock advance 21.13% in April through June. After consolidating for much of the quarter, the stock started jumping earlier this month on strong quarterly results and management raising their outlook for AI-related revenue generation. Investors also came away with increased confidence that the legacy aspects of the business were bottoming and set to rebound into the back half of the year. That confidence also makes sense when considering that Broadcom is a key Apple supplier. So any outsized AI-upgrade cycle that Apple sees is going to translate into a strong cycle for suppliers like Broadcom as well. Worst Performers EL YTD mountain Estee Lauder YTD Estee Lauder was the worst name of the second quarter for the Club portfolio, losing 30.98%. The stock was largely rangebound in April, however, the negative momentum took hold once again when shares got punished for its light guidance. Management's disappointing outlook sparked fresh concerns over the pace of the recovery in Asia Travel Retail. While the report was largely positive and we did see signs of an inflection playing out, these concerns on the pace and magnitude of the recovery continue to weigh on shares. DIS YTD mountain Disney YTD The second worst performer was Disney , which dropped 18.85% in April through June. Disney started to drift back down after management won its proxy fight to keep activist investor Nelson Peltz off the company board. Peltz, who had a big stake in Disney, exited the position. The stock then took another hit on lackluster earnings , in which the company missed expectations on the top line. While noting that Disney's combined direct-to-consumer (DTC) business is still on the path to profitability by the end of fiscal year 2024 in September, the current quarter would see pressure resulting seasonal weakness attributable to its streaming offering in India, known as Disney+ Hotstar. SWK YTD mountain Stanley Black & Decker YTD The third worst performer of the quarter was Stanley Black & Decker , with an 18.42% decline. While shares recovered post-earnings losses quickly, they subsequently reversed back down and now sit below where the level reached in the selloff after the quarterly numbers were release in early May. At least some of that pressure was likely caused by a rebound in longer-term bond yields, which kept borrowing costs high. We view Stanley Black & Decker as our play on Federal Reserve interest rate cuts, which when they happen, should lower mortgages and boost the housing market. Stanley Black & Decker was one of nine stocks featured in our Fed rate cut stocks commentary. (See here for a full list of the stocks in Jim Cramer's Charitable Trust.)

CNBC,https://www.cnbc.com/2024/06/29/obama-clinton-excuse-biden-trump-debate.html,2024-06-29,14:36:53 UTC,"Obama, Clinton excuse Biden's debate performance to fend off Democratic meltdown: 'Bad debate nights happen'","Former US President Barack Obama (L) and former US President Bill Clinton (R) cheer for US President Joe Biden during a campaign fundraising event at Radio City Music Hall in New York City on March 28, 2024.

Former Presidents Barack Obama and Bill Clinton on Friday tried to do some damage control following President Joe Biden's debate fumble against his November election opponent, former President Donald Trump.

""Bad debate nights happen. Trust me, I know. But this election is still a choice between someone who has fought for ordinary folks his entire life and someone who only cares about himself,"" Obama said in a post on X, linking to Biden's campaign website. ""Last night didn't change that, and it's why so much is at stake in November.""

Several hours later, Clinton mimicked the defensive play.

""I'll leave the debate rating to the pundits, but here's what I know: facts and history matter,"" Clinton said in his own post on X, following with a brief list of Biden's accomplishments.

Throughout the 90-minute showdown on Thursday, Biden regularly stumbled, taking mid-sentence pauses to gather his words and tripping over his sentences. The blunders happened even on topics like abortion and the economy, which he tends to be cogent on during campaign rallies and White House events.

The messaging from Obama and Clinton marks a shift in strategy for Democrats as they try to course-correct after Thursday's flop.

Much of Democrats' spin immediately following the debate attempted to play down Biden's conspicuous blunders, instead attacking Trump's performance and giving Biden a generous evaluation.

""As the night went on, I think [Biden] really kind of rose to the occasion,"" Biden co-campaign chair Mitch Landrieu told NBC News Thursday night after the debate. ""I'm proud of the fact that he stood up to Donald Trump.""

The comments from Obama and Clinton represent a new tact: Acknowledge the debate disaster and then tell the public not to focus on it.

Biden himself followed that framing on Friday during a rally in North Carolina: ""Folks, I don't walk as easily as I used to. I don't speak as smoothly as I used to. I don't debate as well as I used to. But I know what I do know: I know how to tell the truth.""

But debates do matter to voters. After the September 2020 debate, a slew of polls found that voters thought Biden did a better job, which helped him maintain his lead against Trump.

This year's presidential race has been a near dead-heat so far and will likely be won by tight margins come November, leaving little room for error.

In the days since the debate, Democrats have been concerned about how it might weigh on voter perceptions, which are already rife with worries about Biden's age and fitness to lead the country for another four years.

Some Democratic strategists, donors and pundits have already suggested that Biden should drop out of the race and reopen the Democratic field to potentially stronger candidates.

The Biden campaign has so far rejected that proposal. Biden and Trump are scheduled to face off at a second and final debate on Sept. 10.","Former Presidents Barack Obama and Bill Clinton on Friday tried to do some damage control following President Joe Biden's debate fumble against his November election opponent, former President Donald Trump.

I had saved $400,000 and had the flexibility to make the leap, but whether it was uncertain streams of income, wanderlust and mostly, the financial benefits of staying put, something had been holding me back. Until November 2023, when I visited a friend at their Fremont, California, apartment complex. When I walked in, it felt like home. As fate would have it, as I was leaving, I met my friend's neighbors, a couple breaking their lease. My gut told me that this was the right moment. After a few hours and some paperwork, I secured a four-month sublease agreement from them for $2,000 a month. It was the perfect transitional space. Once my sublease was up, in April, I moved into a 556-square-foot studio in the same complex for $2,146 a month. DON'T MISS: The ultimate guide to earning passive income online The building is 10 minutes away from the studio I built off of my parent's place where I teach my music students, and less than a 10 minute drive from two beloved local Costco stores. That might seem like an odd amenity to look for in real estate, but to me, it was a huge asset. Altogether, I have spent over $5,000 to outfit my place almost entirely with Costco products.

Why Costco means so much to me

Costco was a shopping staple for my family when I was growing up. And back in 2013, I started going all the time after work, to browse the aisles and try out samples while waiting out the rush hour traffic. Over time, Costco has become more than just a store to me — it's a place for me to belong and feel like myself. My love for it inspired me to create my Instagram account, Costco Claudia. Since launching in winter of 2022, Costco Claudia has become a creative outlet and an income stream. On the account, I primarily post videos of myself modeling women's clothing in the store, and I currently have 191,000 followers and counting. While I have never worked directly with or for Costco, I have had partnerships with brands that are sold by the company.

I currently make about $7,000 a month as an influencer and $5,000 a month from my job as a piano teacher. One of the most surprising and gratifying parts of this experience has been the incredible positivity I've received from my Costco Claudia community. They offered so much comfort and solidarity when I felt most alone, particularly as I learned about my PMDD and navigated living on my own. Their support has helped me through some of my toughest times.

Take a look inside my cozy California studio

For utilities, I spend about $102 a month: $27 for water and trash collection, $30 for internet, and $45 for electricity. Take a look inside: My kitchen is a space to fuel up and get ready for the day Over the years, I've collected a bunch of discounted stuff from Costco sales: glasses, plates, bowls, my NutriBullet, a Brita filter, and loads of snacks.

One of my favorite items in my kitchen is my coffee machine. Photo: Bart Vandever for CNBC Make It

What I really rely on in my kitchen are my coffee machine and the garage ""work table"" — both found at Costco — which doubles as my kitchen table. It's sturdy and looks great with the faux fur sheepskins I use to cover my chairs.

This work table is one of my favorite finds. Photo: Bart Vandever for CNBC Make It

I surround myself with greenery and music in my living room After a long day of teaching, I enjoy winding down in my cozy living room. My forest of growing monsteras and succulents adds a touch of greenery and calmness to the space.

Music brings me so much joy, and this piano gets a lot of use at my place. Photo: Bart Vandever for CNBC Make It

I like to lie on my couch and lose myself in classical music on my piano. Surrounded by blankets, sheepskin rugs, pillows, and stylish tray, it's the perfect way to recharge after a busy day. My bathroom is both luxurious and pragmatic

My bathroom is pretty spacious for a small space, and I found most of my essentials at Costco. Photo: Bart Vandever for CNBC Make It

In my bathroom, the essentials that I can't do without: my gold hoop earrings, my two pairs of glasses and my contacts that I wear every single day. When I first moved out, I found all the bathroom basics I needed at Costco: towels, hand towels, a shower curtain, soap dispenser, and mats. When allergy season strikes, the tissue paper is a lifesaver, since they sell it in bulk. The real steal in my bathroom is the perfume that usually goes for $200 at other stores but is $69.99 at Costco. I've got two of them, and they've become my go-to scents. My bedroom is a haven My $250 bed frame paired with my $500 mattress are so comfortable. I have two sets of Kirkland Signature 680 Thread Count Sheet Set that I snagged when they went on sale. I love my down blanket and I have another favorite I got for $12.

In woven side baskets, I stash my Costco pajamas, keeping everything neat and organized. I also love my Shark Roomba, which cleans my apartment when I'm not here. An outdoor space with possibility The outdoor space isn't fully furnished yet. So far, my Costco paddle board is the centerpiece.

The 30-year-old, who has been competing on the international fencing circuit since she was 15, has relied on her trusty paper planner to make sense of full days that involve lectures, workouts, exams and a lot of studying.

CNBC,https://www.cnbc.com/2024/06/30/how-to-avoid-job-scams-online-according-to-career-experts.html,2024-06-30,13:40:01 UTC,"How to avoid scams while job-hunting online, according to career experts","Landing a job has become more difficult, even while the labor market may look robust — and it's a situation that scammers are eager to exploit. It's a big enough issue that federal agencies like the FBI and Federal Trade Commission have issued warnings about job scams. One common scheme: Swindlers who pose as recruiters and contact you unprompted — including on job boards like Indeed and LinkedIn or even through WhatsApp messages — to entice you with a job opportunity you didn't apply for. Then, they may ask you to send them money or personal information, according to Amanda Augustine, a career expert at TopResume. Or they might claim that you first need to complete their training course or coaching services to be eligible for their job opening in a predatory attempt to sell you their products, she says. While real recruiters do often reach out cold to potential hires, there's a key difference between them and the grifters: ""They're straightforward with you,"" says career and leadership coach Phoebe Gavin. Here are ways to spot and protect yourself from a con while job-hunting.

Be skeptical if the job looks too perfect

If a job posting ""seems too good to be true,"" it probably is, Augustine says. That includes openings promising to make you a lot of money fast. In those ""get-rich-quick"" instances, ""run for the hills,"" Augustine cautions. Be wary if a company is quick to offer you a position without going through the standard vetting procedure. A legitimate process should require at least one interview, even if it's only over the phone, she says. Still, an interview doesn't guarantee the role is above board. Scammers sometimes hold phony interviews using text chat and video messaging to obtain your personal information without blowing their cover, according to ZipRecruiter. Some duped job hunters have taken to social media to share their experiences with fake interviews. LinkedIn blocked more than 63 million fake accounts during the second half of 2023, according to its most recent community report. The platform also removed more than 108 million pieces of spam and scam content over the same period, per the report. The job site is ""committed to ensuring the platform remains authentic, secure, and easy to use for members,"" said Oscar Rodriguez, LinkedIn's vice president of trust product management, in a statement. Ultimately, if a recruiter reaches out to you for an unusually attractive job you haven't applied for, ""you need to be especially suspicious,"" Augustine says.

Question vague or nonexistent job descriptions

Sometimes a disguised fraudster will insist they can't provide any details because a job posting is confidential. But generally, if a company can't produce a copy of the job description, that's a big red flag, Augustine says. Some companies make executive-level job openings confidential to high-profile applicants at first, but they will begin disclosing more details about the role as the interview process gets underway. ""If you are not at a director level or above and someone is approaching you for a confidential listing, it's probably a scam, because there isn't really much reason for a company to be cagey about hiring an individual contributor or a manager-level position,"" Gavin says. ""It's those senior-level positions that can have some PR consequences if it is known that they're doing a search."" For job openings that have no reason being kept so tightly under wraps, a formal job description should be handed over upon request, Augustine explains. You should also watch out for job descriptions that are ""really vague"" and fail to offer enough information about the job title, location, key responsibilities and qualifications. A job description riddled with typos and errors can also indicate a scam. Because of new tools powered by artificial intelligence like ChatGPT that can fix grammatical issues in text, however, Augustine says this clue is becoming less prominent.

Check the company's online footprint

You should be able to locate a company's digital presence, Augustine says. That could be a LinkedIn profile, website or social media page. ""Even your mom-and-pop ice cream shop has a Facebook page these days,"" she says. ""If there's absolutely no digital trail about this company, or it's really, really sparse when you're running some Google searches, I would be concerned."" Ask a prospective employer to direct you to their website — where you can also see if the job listing is posted — and double-check any links you receive to make sure they don't route to a phishing website, Gavin suggests. Exercise caution if a recruiter is not using a corporate email address, Augustine says. You may find third-party recruiters who use a Gmail account, but internal recruiters typically have a company email address, she notes. Also, watch out for communications from email addresses with misspellings or ""spoofed"" company names that are similar but slightly different from the actual business name, according to Indeed's guidelines for a safe job search. If you're still unsure whether a company is legitimate, Augustine suggests searching the company's name along with the word ""scam"" on Google. That search may turn up a history of dishonest activity if it's an illicit enterprise that has struck before.

'Take your time' and don't get discouraged","It's a big enough issue that federal agencies like the FBI and Federal Trade Commission have issued warnings about job scams.

CNBC,https://www.cnbc.com/2024/06/30/fathom-joint-venture-of-amc-regal-cinemark-makes-major-gains.html,2024-06-30,15:21:20 UTC,"Fathom, the company behind classic films at your local theater, is making major gains in moviegoing","At a time when the box office is starved for content and audiences seem pickier than ever, Fathom Events is posting record revenue gains.

For 20 years, the joint venture between AMC , Regal and Cinemark has been best known for bringing alternative content to the big screen in the form of classic Hollywood titles, live telecasts of theater and opera productions, concerts and even television series.

Most recently, it ventured into the specialty distribution space to deliver ""The Blind,"" ""The Chosen,"" ""Jesus Thirsts: The Miracle of the Eucharist"" and ""Waitress: the Musical"" to audiences. Still to come is ""Andrea Bocelli 30: The Celebration.""

In 2023, Fathom generated $100 million at the box office, a 116% increase over 2019 levels and its highest-grossing year ever. And that momentum has continued into 2024, as the company tallied $43 million in the first quarter, up nearly 140% compared to the $18 million it tallied in the year-earlier period.

Fathom's relationships with Hollywood's biggest studios and its cinematic reach — as the partnership of the industry's three biggest theater chains — has made it a formidable force at the box office. Its value proposition is twofold: It breathes new life into older films, and into theaters.

""Falling mostly under the event film banner, anniversary titles have truly come into vogue seemingly more so now than in years past with a particular emphasis given to these beloved older films,"" said Paul Dergarabedian, senior media analyst at Comscore. ""These anniversary re-releases are a win-win, providing joy to movie fans and notably additional revenues to movie theaters often decades after initial theatrical run.""

In post-pandemic times, Fathom has acted as a crutch for many smaller cinema operators, providing much-needed content for the big screen amid a drought caused by pandemic and strike-related production shutdowns.

Season 4 of ""The Chosen,"" a faith-based television show about the life of Jesus, generated $32 million at the box office for Fathom, around 75% of its first-quarter haul.

""'The Chosen' was through [Fathom], and it was huge for us,"" said Brock Bagby, president and chief content, programming and development officer at B&B Theatres. ""It gave us a lot of extra revenue in February and the beginning of March that we wouldn't have had.""

Fathom has also benefited from its anniversary titles and classic cinema showings. Each year, the company brings films back to theaters to celebrate milestone years alongside fan-favorite titles.

""We've seen that there's a growing segment in the box office, people that are interested in seeing older films on the big screen,"" said Jordan Hohman, vice president of project development at Phoenix Theatres. ""These audiences are getting to enjoy classic films, either for the first time or for the first time, in a new way. I think that that's valuable.""

This year, the company celebrated the 85th anniversaries of ""The Wizard of Oz"" and ""Gone with the Wind"" as well as the 35th anniversary of ""Steel Magnolias."" Still on the calendar is the 50th anniversary of ""Blazing Saddles,"" the 70th anniversary of Alfred Hitchcock's ""Rear Window,"" the 40th anniversary of ""Neverending Story"" and the 20th anniversary of ""Mean Girls.""

It also has a film series called Studio Ghibli Fest, which features 14 films from the studio in their original Japanese and English dubbed versions. This year, the lineup boasts the 20th anniversary of ""Howl's Moving Castle,"" the 35th anniversary of ""Kiki's Delivery Service"" and the 30th anniversary of ""Pom Poko.""

And these titles can generate big box-office hauls even decades after they were first released.

Fathom's three-weekend run of the original Lord of the Rings trilogy resulted in $8.2 million at the box office.

""Lord of the Rings was wildly successful nationwide, and for us,"" Bagby said. ""We just did 4DX Lord of the Rings this weekend in our new Dallas theater, and we sold out every single show.""

4DX is a screen format that utilizes motion seats, practical effects and sensory elements to immerse viewers in a movie experience.

Audiences are already buying tickets for showings in August celebrating the 15th anniversary of ""Coraline,"" which will be shown widely in 3D for the first time since its original release.

Fathom re-released ""Coraline"" twice before with great success. In 2022, the film showed in 800 theaters for one day and tallied $1.2 million in ticket sales. Last year, the film extended its release to five days and snared $7.1 million, making it the highest-grossing classic film release in Fathom history.

That $7.1 million figure is about 10% of the initial domestic run for ""Coraline"" in 2009 and 42% of its opening weekend, according to data from Comscore.

What's more, 53% of the audience who attended screenings of the film last year were 34 years old or younger.

""New audiences are seeing it for the first time although the film is 15 years old,"" said Ray Nutt, CEO of Fathom Events.

Fathom reports presales for this year's screenings of ""Coraline"" are selling seven times as many tickets per location as were sold during the same period last year, with two-thirds of those ticket sales for the 3D version of the film.

Because Fathom has a wide footprint through its parent companies and nationwide marketing, it does the heavy lifting for smaller theater chains.

""[Fathom has] built a lot of relationships,"" Phoenix Theatre's Hohman said. ""They worked out the licensing and they created the marketing behind re-releasing these classic films that, you know, we just can't do ourselves. It's a national campaign. So, I think that they just offer a lot of value.""","At a time when the box office is starved for content and audiences seem pickier than ever, Fathom Events is posting record revenue gains.

France will hold an early legislative election in two rounds on June 30 and July 7 2024, following President Emmanuel Macrons decision which was triggered by his party's heavy defeat to the far-right National Rally in the 2024 European Parliament election.

French voters are heading to the polls on Sunday for the first round of voting in a snap parliamentary election that could see the far-right National Rally group become the biggest party in France's National Assembly, polls suggest. France's President Emmanuel Macron shocked the electorate and political pundits in early June when he called the ballot after his Renaissance party suffered a drubbing in European Parliament elections at the hands of National Rally, led by Jordan Bardella and veteran right-wing politician Marine Le Pen.

Calling the snap election, which involves two rounds of polling on Sunday and on July 7, Macron said the vote would provide ""clarification"" and that ""France needs a clear majority to act in serenity and harmony."" Analysts said Macron's shock move was likely based on the gamble that, even if National Rally performs well, a potentially chaotic and disordered period in power will reduce the likelihood that his rival Le Pen will assume French leadership in 2027. Close watchers of French politics also note that Macron is ultimately betting on French citizens fearing a far-right government and voting against the nationalist and anti-immigration party. But voter polls in June have consistently put National Rally ahead in the race, predicting the party will take around 35% of the vote, ahead of the leftist New Popular Front bloc with around 25-26% of the ballot and Macron's centrist Together alliance, in third place with around 19% of the vote.

Even if a hung parliament is the most likely outcome of the vote — with no single party looking as if it can achieve an absolute majority of 289 seats in the 577-seat National Assembly — a strong showing for National Rally will put pressure on Macron to appoint a prime minister from the party. That new PM — who in this scenario would likely be the 28-year-old National Rally President Jordan Bardella — would then have a significant say over France's domestic and economic policy, while President Macron would remain in charge of foreign policy and defense.

In any case, such an outcome would force ideologically different (and often opposed) politicians into an uneasy and awkward ""cohabitation"" where government is likely fractious and unstable, prompting some concern among economists as to how the vote could affect the euro zone's second-largest economy. ""The market has reacted negatively to the election uncertainty, with French equities underperforming and the France-Germany 10-year yield spread widening,"" Peter Garnry, head of Strategy at Saxo Bank, said in a note Monday. ""Despite this, some views suggest the market may be overreacting, drawing parallels to Italy's experience under Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni, whose initially feared policies were more pragmatic than expected,"" he noted.

Political analysts point out that a period of hard bargaining is likely to follow the election, as parties look to forge alliances that would enable them to achieve parliamentary majority and govern as fractiously as possible. It could be a torturous process, analysts warn. ""As with the 2022 elections, no party or bloc is likely to secure enough seats to form a majority government, although some polls give the RN an outside chance of doing so. The next government is highly likely to require some form of negotiation between different parties,"" George Dyson, senior analyst at Control Risks said in analysis Monday. ""In the event that the RN secures enough votes to come close to forming a government, it will potentially be able to secure support from dissident members of the [center-right] Republicans to secure a majority or argue that no other government is feasible."" Dyson noted that, as current polling suggests that the united left bloc will be the second largest in parliament after the RN, the next administration may also conceivably be a left-wing government that can cobble together support from the Republicans and Macron's centrist Renaissance party. ""Macron will likely push for support from centrist parties to put forwards a candidate of his choosing for prime minister, but the parties would be unlikely to provide their support as his party is projected to perform very poorly,"" Dyson said.

Pride month is winding down — and this year, the corporate world took a more cautious approach. June tends to bring a wave of rainbow-themed merchandise and affirming ads and social media posts from retailers and consumers brands, coinciding with parades and other events that celebrate the LGBTQ+ community. As the presidential election approaches, however, some companies have grown quieter about diversity, equity and inclusion efforts to avoid stepping into the culture wars or facing the blowback from conservative customers that Target and Bud Light did a year ago. The starkest example of that came late Thursday: Tractor Supply, a retailer that sells animal feed, cowboy boots and lawn supplies in rural parts of the country, said it is ending all spending tied to diversity and environmental causes. That includes no longer sponsoring Pride festivals, the statement said. The move, while an outlier in its magnitude, underscores how some companies that made inclusion commitments in recent years are treading cautiously. It is difficult to track how many companies shared supportive messages, donated to LGBTQ+ causes or sold rainbow-themed merchandise in June compared to previous years. According to Gravity Research, a Washington, D.C.-based reputational research firm, 45% of Fortune 100 companies had at least one social media post on LinkedIn or X explicitly related to Pride as of June 21 this year, compared with 51% last June. Gravity Research President Luke Hartig said the volatility of the presidential election and the two candidates' willingness to call out companies by name has also made companies less likely to go public about their stand. ""There's a little bit of like, 'keep our heads down while we go through this election,'"" he said. Tim Bennett, cofounder of Tribury Productions, a marketing company that specializes in reaching LGBTQ+ Americans, works with Fortune 500 companies, including recent projects with Procter & Gamble. He said more clients have taken ""a wait-and-see"" approach to marketing to LGBTQ+ consumers or decided to scatter efforts throughout the year instead of making a big splash in a single month. ""June this year has not been like the last five or six,"" Bennett said. That may not be a bad thing for LGBTQ+ initiatives and charities. Sarah Kate Ellis, CEO of nonprofit advocacy group GLAAD, said she's seeing more companies get involved with year-round philanthropy and activism in more meaningful ways. She also pointed to a survey by Gravity Research that found that 78% of companies did not plan to change their Pride strategy this year. Thirteen percent were unsure whether they'd make changes and 9% said they planned to revise their strategy. Gravity Research surveyed 45 corporate executives and Fortune 500 leaders across industries in April. ""The visibility of companies putting flags out and having product to celebrate our Pride and to mark a month that's really significant and important for our community is really important, and I don't want to ever devalue that,"" Ellis said. ""I do think, though, those companies must look inside and make sure that they have the policies and the HR practices that match their outward marketing."" Major companies are still writing checks for LGBTQ+ causes, too. A GLAAD spokesperson said Friday that the group has not seen donations or corporate support decline this Pride month, though it does not yet have a total tally. On Friday, when the Stonewall National Monument Visitor Center officially opened its doors to commemorate the New York City bar that was a catalyst in the LGBTQ+ rights movement, the event had major backing from the business community. Supporters included Google, Amazon, JPMorgan Chase and Booking.com. President Joe Biden also made an appearance and remarks at the monument's opening.

The Bud Light and Target effect

Consumer staples brands were the most likely to say they planned to shift their Pride month strategy this year, according to Gravity Research's survey. That may stem from the conservative boycotts of Target and Bud Light last year. Target has carried a Pride collection for over a decade. Yet last year, the big-box retailer removed some items and moved displays after employees faced threats. Boycotters targeted items for transgender shoppers, such as ""tuck-friendly"" swimsuits, and also criticized separate Pride merchandise for kids. Instead of putting Pride merchandise in all stores this year, Target only carried it in the locations that accounted for 90% of total Pride sales in 2022 and 2023. It also stopped selling any Pride apparel for kids. On the company's website and in those select stores, shoppers can find a wide variety of Pride-themed items. The volume of negative feedback to the Pride collection externally and internally is ""significantly lower"" this year than in 2023, according to a Target spokesperson. In a statement, Target said it is ""committed to supporting the LGBTQIA+ community during Pride Month and year-round"" and would participate in Pride events across the country and support LGBTQ+ groups, in addition to offering Pride products.

Anheuser-Busch InBev and other large beer brands, on the other hand, have backed away from public support of the LGBTQ+ community. Conservatives like singer Kid Rock and Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis called for a boycott of the beer and its parent company, Anheuser-Busch InBev, after Bud Light sent personalized cans of its beer to transgender influencer Dylan Mulvaney. The marketing campaign coincided with the March Madness college basketball tournament. Bud Light sales tumbled around 25%, and the brand lost its spot as the best-selling beer in the U.S., ceding the position it held for more than two decades to Constellation Brands' Modelo. AB InBev distanced itself from Mulvaney and fired Bud Light's vice president of marketing. In October, AB InBev CEO Michel Doukeris said the brand would focus its marketing more on events like sports games and concerts. It also returned as the official sponsor of the UFC. In recent months, some consumers have returned to Bud Light, as RBC Europe analysts estimate that the brand's U.S. volume is down only about 10% these days. For its part, Bud Light hasn't posted in support of Pride month on its Instagram or X pages this year. The boycott was unusually sticky for a few reasons, according to Neil Reid, a geography professor at the University of Toledo who researches the beer industry. Studies have shown that consumers' loyalty to top-selling beers may be more tied to the brand than the taste, Reid said. Right-wing news outlets like Fox News also devoted plenty of airtime to the controversy, stretching its duration and potentially reaching new consumers who missed the initial reaction. Plus, once Bud Light sales fell, retailers gave more shelf space to its rivals. ""You can look at this issue from a moral, ethical perspective or you can also look at it from a pure business perspective. Those two often don't result in the same strategy,"" Reid said.

The New York Stock Exchange welcomes e.l.f. Beauty (NYSE: ELF), on March 18, 2024, to the podium to celebrate its 20th anniversary of founding. To honor the occasion, Tarang Amin, Chairman & CEO, joined by Tara Dziedzic, NYSE Head of Listings - U.S. Sectors, rings The Opening Bell®.

He also gave great life advice, according to billionaire philanthropist Melinda French Gates.

French Gates, 59, shared her favorite lesson of Munger's during a recent commencement speech at Stanford University. ""Charlie famously said that the highest form which civilization can reach is a seamless web of deserved trust. Totally reliable people, correctly trusting each other,"" she said. ""What a thing to aspire to.""

""As a society, we aren't always set up to feel responsibility for the person who's next to us or the person who's on the other side of a divide or a debate,"" French Gates added. ""But we need each other. No matter who you are, there will be moments in your journey when you need to be carried or when someone else will need you to carry them.""

Munger, who died last year at age 99, spent decades as the vice-chairman of Berkshire Hathaway — Warren Buffett's longtime business partner and right-hand man. His advice often extended beyond finance and investing, and was usually shaped by his down-to-earth demeanor and optimistic outlook on life.

For most people, connections can play a major role in your personal or professional success. Bosses and mentors may help you excel in the workplace or open their network to you. Your friends might give you great relationship advice. Even a stranger at the grocery store could introduce you to a new brand of food that you grow to love.

Assembling connections intentionally is even a leadership strategy: Lisa Skeete Tatum, founder and CEO of career coaching company Landit, told CNBC Make It in 2022 about the personal board of directors she created to help her make decisions, provide a listening ear or speak up on her behalf.

""I would not be where I am today if it wasn't for people who believed in me,"" said Skeete Tatum. ""If you want to progress, you have to surround yourself with people that have higher expectations of you than you have of yourself.""

DON'T MISS: The ultimate guide to becoming a master communicator and public speaker

Her comments echoed Munger's lesson that people can go much further together than they can alone, and by being a caring, trustworthy person, others will provide you that same kind of support. Similarly, French Gates urged her audience to make ""strong, reciprocal bonds with other people, even if they disagree on issues big or small.""

""You are graduating into a broken world, but it is community that rebuilds things,"" she said. ""Together is how you'll make the broken things whole again.""

CNBC,https://www.cnbc.com/2024/06/30/how-life-expectancy-figures-into-retirement-planning.html,2024-06-30,13:00:01 UTC,How long you may live is one of retirement planning's biggest unknowns. How experts say to get the best estimate,"Peopleimages | Istock | Getty Images

To effectively plan for your retirement, experts say, you need to watch your savings rate and total nest egg. But how much you really need to have set aside depends on another number — your life expectancy. Yet that figure is also the most elusive — no one knows how long they will live. ""Nobody really knows, and that uncertainty is uncomfortable,"" said Lisa Schilling, director of practice research at the Society of Actuaries Research Institute, the research arm of the Society of Actuaries. The financial industry typically uses age 95 as a default assumption, according to research from HealthView Services, a provider of health-care cost projection software. More from Personal Finance:

Older voters want candidates who will protect Social Security

Workers in certain industries tend to have higher 401(k) balances Instead of planning for one life expectancy number, the Society of Actuaries and American Academy of Actuaries emphasize longevity. Longevity risk measures the likelihood someone may live longer than expected and outlive their savings. ""If you read that life expectancy is 84 and you are planning on your money lasting until 84, there's a big surprise behind the curtain that you haven't opened,"" Schilling said. ""There's a really good chance for a lot of reasons that you might need your money to last longer than that.""

Longevity estimates may bring surprises

The Society of Actuaries and American Academy of Actuaries recently relaunched a free online longevity illustrator. The tool asks for basic information on either an individual or a couple: age, sex, retirement age, smoking status and a description of their general health — poor, average or excellent. The results aim to provide a ""reasonable"" estimate of how long you might live, according to the organizations. The illustrations show the probability of living to certain ages, as well as the number of years of life one might live in retirement. Generally, the higher your current age, the greater the possibility you may live longer. While life expectancy at birth may be 84, it will be even longer if you've already made it to age 65, Schilling said.

The results may help individuals fully understand the range of possibilities when planning for how long their money may need to last, she said. For couples, there is also another revelation that often comes as a surprise. ""The chance that at least one of you lives to 90 is even bigger,"" Schilling said. Yet the financial industry's assumption of living to age 95 may be too generous, according to recent research from HealthView Services. The projected life expectancy for someone who is 65 years old today with no chronic conditions is age 90 for women and age 88 for men. Yet only around 5% of people over 60 have no chronic conditions, according to the research.

Health status affects life expectancy projections

Chronic health conditions such as high blood pressure, cardiovascular disease, cancer, diabetes, high cholesterol, tobacco use, obesity or Parkinson's disease reduce an individual's projected life expectancy. For example, while a healthy 65-year-old man with no chronic conditions has a 19.3% probability of living to age 95 or longer, that gets reduced to a 17.5% chance if he has high blood pressure, 15.8% if he has cardiovascular disease, 12.5% for high cholesterol, 8.8% for obesity with a body mass index of 35 to 39, 7.4% for tobacco use, 2% for obesity with body mass index of 40 to 44 and to just 0.4% for diabetes, according to the research. Those probabilities could mean a huge difference to his retirement funding needs. A healthy 65-year-old man may need around $1.1 million to maintain the 80% income replacement rate he needs if he was earning $100,000 in 2023, according to HealthView Services. This assumes he lives to age 95, has a 6% annual portfolio return, receives Social Security benefits, and inflation is 3%.

However, if that 65-year-old man has a chronic condition, his life expectancy will be lower. And that could free up more of that retirement nest egg to be spent in other ways, according to HealthView Services. High blood pressure could reduce his life expectancy by nine years to age 86, and therefore allow for $447,469 to be used for long-term care planning, emergency savings, money for heirs or other uses, the research found. Tobacco use could reduce his life expectancy by 13 years to 82, freeing up $616,245, the research estimates, while diabetes may reduce his lifespan by 16 years, enabling him to spend $727,947. Most experts advise individuals to plan for outliving their assets by delaying Social Security retirement benefits or considering an annuity to amplify monthly income.

""It's worth paying attention to value,"" the firm's head of research told CNBC's ""ETF Edge"" this week. ""It feels like … [for a] long time that growth has outperformed value.""

On Friday, the Russell indexes underwent their annual reconstitution to reflect changes in the market as companies grow and shift. The iShares Russell 1000 Growth ETF is up 20% so far this year, while the iShares Russell 1000 Value ETF is up almost 6%.

""We do think there's a place for both growth and value within a broader portfolio — just people are skewed more toward growth heading into the second half of the year,"" he added. ""There have been periods when the pendulum has swung back in favor of value.""

FTSE Russell CEO Fiona Bassett said on ""ETF Edge"" the indices are built to reflect the nature of the market.

CNBC,https://www.cnbc.com/2024/06/29/bitcoin-windfall-comes-for-mt-gox-creditors-after-10000percent-price-spike.html,2024-06-29,12:00:01 UTC,"Bitcoin windfall coming for Mt. Gox creditors after decade-long wait and 10,000% price spike","Users of collapsed bitcoin exchange Mt. Gox have been trying to get their money back for a decade. From the beginning of July, the company will begin paying users back their funds. Kiyoshi Ota | Bloomberg | Getty Images

Mt. Gox, the Japanese bitcoin exchange that collapsed into bankruptcy a decade ago after a major hack, is finally set to repay creditors, who are being rewarded handsomely for their patience. Up to 950,000 bitcoin were lost in the 2011 hack, at a time when the cryptocurrency was trading for a tiny fraction of its current value. Some 140,000 of those coins were recovered, a haul that, at today's prices, means that roughly $9 billion worth of bitcoin will be returned to its owners. Among the claimants is Illinois native Gregory Greene. Soon after the exchange declared bankruptcy in February 2014, Greene filed a class action lawsuit against Mt. Gox and its former CEO. Greene said at the time that his frozen account contained $25,000 in bitcoin, though he didn't disclose the exact number of coins in his wallet. Bitcoin was then trading at roughly $600. Today it's worth over $60,000. That suggests Greene's lost stash, at current prices, would be worth about $2.5 million, a 10,000% gain. However, it's unclear how much he'll receive in the payouts, which are expected to start rolling out in July. John Glover, chief investment officer of crypto lending firm Ledn, said creditors are about to get a historic windfall. ""Many will clearly cash out and enjoy the fact that having their assets stuck in the Mt. Gox bankruptcy was the best investment they ever made,"" Glover told CNBC.

What was Mt. Gox?

Mt. Gox was an online marketplace where people could buy or sell bitcoin using different currencies. At the height of its success, the platform was the largest spot bitcoin exchange in the world, claiming to handle around 80% of all global dollar trades for bitcoin.

The company, whose acronym was created from the name ""Magic: The Gathering Online Exchange,"" shuttered in February 2014 after a series of heists. Mt. Gox blamed the bitcoin disappearance on a bug in the cryptocurrency's framework. While users were receiving incomplete transaction messages when accessing the exchange, in reality coins may have been illicitly moved by hackers out of their accounts, Mt. Gox said. On Monday, the court-appointed trustee overseeing the exchange's bankruptcy proceedings said distributions to the firm's roughly 20,000 creditors would begin next month. Disbursements will be in a mix of bitcoin and bitcoin cash, an early offshoot of the original cryptocurrency. Alex Thorn, head of research at crypto asset management firm Galaxy Digital, said in a note last month that the vast majority of creditors he's spoken with have said they will take a payout in-kind, meaning in cryptocurrency rather than fiat. They'll also be largely holding on to the assets. Many of the top holders with claims to Mt. Gox assets, he said, are well known in the bitcoin world. They include early bitcoin investor Roger Ver, Blockstream co-founders Adam Back and Greg Maxwell, and Bruce Fenton, former executive director of the Bitcoin Foundation.

Some will 'take the money and run'

Based on conversations with institutional investors due for payouts, ""we do not believe there will be significant selling from this cohort,"" Thorn wrote. However, Glover, who was previously a managing director at Barclays, said there's still likely to be significant selling among creditors who, after years of waiting, have the opportunity to lock in massive gains. ""Some will clearly choose to take the money and run,"" said Glover. Analysts at JPMorgan Chase said the potential for heavy selling from Mt. Gox creditors creates ""downside risk"" next month, though it would be short-lived.

""Assuming most of the liquidations by Mt. Gox creditors take place in July, [this] creates a trajectory where crypto prices come under further pressure in July, but start rebounding from August onwards,"" the analysts wrote. There's also the likelihood that a number of bitcoin investors in Mt. Gox have already cashed out. In the 10 years since the exchange filed for bankruptcy, a secondary market sprung up for those who wanted to liquidate their bankruptcy claim. Those who have held out are the true believers, Thorn said. ""Thousands of these creditors have waited 10 years for payouts and resisted compelling and aggressive claims' offers during that time, suggesting they want their coins back,"" said Thorn. He said he expects limited selling pressure but acknowledged that if even 10% of the bitcoin distributed is sold ""it will have a market impact."" Certain tax consequences may deter sales. Luke Nolan, ethereum research associate at digital asset management firm CoinShares, said a big reason Mt. Gox creditors opted for in-kind reimbursement has to do with the tax implications. And JPMorgan said in a note on Monday that people are leaning toward accepting their disbursement in crypto, ""either for tax reasons or because they think that liquidating now would void potential further price gains in future."" Glover said there are ways to sidestep a big capital gains tax while still taking advantage of bitcoin's huge run-up in value. ""Those in jurisdictions with capital gains tax may elect to hold their positions to avoid this huge tax bill,"" Glover said, ""and instead use their bitcoin as collateral to borrow dollars, thus monetizing the bitcoin without having to sell it.""","Users of collapsed bitcoin exchange Mt.

CNBC,https://www.cnbc.com/2024/06/29/biden-campaign-fundraises-27-million-post-debate.html,2024-06-29,16:49:15 UTC,Biden campaign fundraises $27 million after first debate,"US President Joe Biden speaks at the Stonewall National Monument Visitor Center grand opening ceremony in New York on June 28, 2024.

The Biden campaign has raised $27 million starting from the day of the first presidential debate through Friday evening, a campaign spokesperson announced on Saturday.

The number comes in the middle of President Joe Biden's post-debate fundraising swing, during which the campaign is looking to keep pace with former President Donald Trump's recent donation momentum.

The Biden campaign, the Democratic National Convention, and Biden PACs and committees jointly raised $85 million in May, lagging behind Trump's $141 million haul in the same month that the former president was convicted on 34 felony charges.

The post-debate campaign push is also trying to reassure donors that Biden can still deliver a Democratic win come November, despite his fumbling performance at Thursday's first debate against Trump.

After the 90-minute face-off in Atlanta, Biden on Friday headed to Raleigh, North Carolina, to hold a rally where he spoke with a more energetic tone and acknowledged his debate slip-ups.

""Folks, I don't walk as easily as I used to. I don't speak as smoothly as I used to. I don't debate as well as I used to. But I know what I do know: I know how to tell the truth,"" he said.

After North Carolina, the president flew to New York to deliver remarks at the Stonewall National Monument Visitor Center to mark Pride Month. Later that evening, he held several campaign receptions.

Biden will participate in even more campaign receptions on Saturday in New York and New Jersey before returning to Camp David later in the evening. Those events will likely boost the $27 million fundraising figure higher.

The Biden campaign did not immediately respond to a request for comment about how much of this new fundraising came from grassroots donors online versus higher-dollar donors.

Since the 90-minute face-off on Thursday, Democrats have been in a frenzy trying to clean up the mess of Biden's debate flop.

Biden supporters, including former Presidents Barack Obama and Bill Clinton have tried to spin the debate by recognizing, rather than ignoring the president's debate blunders while also asking voters to look past them.

Some Democratic strategists, however, are calling on Biden to drop out of the presidential race and forfeit his delegates to a fresh candidate.

Biden and Trump are scheduled to debate again on Sept. 10, a potential redemption opportunity for the president's perception with voters, many of whom express concerns over his age and ability to handle a second term.","US President Joe Biden speaks at the Stonewall National Monument Visitor Center grand opening ceremony in New York on June 28, 2024.

In Moore v. United States, the Supreme Court blocked a challenge to the ""mandatory repatriation tax,"" a one-time levy on certain foreign investments enacted in 2017.

The case centered on a U.S. couple who incurred about $15,000 in taxes on undistributed profits from an overseas company. The Moores argued the levy violated the 16th Amendment because they didn't ""realize"" or receive income.

Here's where U.S. rents are rising — and falling — the fastest

Many tax experts watched the Moore case to gauge Congress' authority to tax unrealized earnings, which could have an impact on wealth tax proposals. But the Supreme Court didn't comment directly on the issue.

""Nothing in this opinion should be read to authorize any hypothetical congressional effort to tax both an entity and its shareholders or partners on the same undistributed income realized by the entity,"" Justice Brett Kavanaugh wrote in his majority opinion.

Still, the 83-page ruling scattered some clues about whether certain versions of a wealth tax could pass constitutional muster, experts say.","While lawmakers have a growing interest in taxing the ultra-rich, last week's Supreme Court ruling could threaten future wealth tax proposals, experts say.

The island's age-defying residents caught the attention of authors Héctor García and Francesc Miralles. The pair interviewed over 100 of the oldest people in Okinawa and wrote about the principles and techniques that Japanese centenarians adhere to daily in their book titled Ikigai: The Japanese Secret to a Long and Happy Life .

On average, Okinawan women live longer lives than women from all other areas worldwide, according to longevity expert Dan Buettner . Additionally, ""Okinawans have less cancer, heart disease and dementia than Americans,"" Buettner wrote on his site .

Blue Zones are areas in the world with the most people living the longest lives.

If you, like many others, have ever fallen down a rabbit hole trying to learn more about what causes some people to live longer and feel more happiness, then you've probably already heard of Blue Zones like Okinawa, Japan.

1. Engage in low-intensity movement for at least 5 minutes a day

Just about every super-ager that García and Miralles spoke to shared that they regularly practice radio taiso which is a well-known, decades-old Japanese exercise.

""Even the residents of the nursing home we visited dedicated at least five minutes every day to it, though some did the exercises from their wheelchairs,"" the authors wrote in their book.

It helps that the exercise calls for low-intensity movements and can be completed in five minutes or less. And what makes the practice really stand out is that it's typically done among groups of people.

One of the main goals of radio taiso is to ""promote a spirit of unity among participants,"" according to García and Miralles.

2. Find a purpose and stay busy

There's a Japanese proverb that states: ""Only staying active will make you want to live a hundred years."" Okinawans achieve this by finding their ikigai, or purpose, that encourages them to focus on their deeper meaning in life.

Ikigai can be loosely translated to ""the happiness of always being busy."" Often, people who live the longest don't retire.

For example, Hayao Miyazaki, 83, is the director of animated films at Studio Ghibli in Japan. A day after retiring in the 90s, Miyazaki came to work to sketch new animations; he just released a movie in 2023.

3. Achieving a state of flow

""There is no magic recipe for finding happiness, for living according to your ikigai,"" García and Miralles wrote in their book. ""But one key ingredient is the ability to reach this state of flow and, through this state, to have an 'optimal experience.'""

Flow is a concept used to describe being fully engaged in an action, and it was coined by psychologist Mihaly Csikszentmihalyi.

Being engulfed in a state of flow allows you to be more present, improve your focus and temporarily forget about your worries, according to García and Miralles.

""The happiest people are not the ones who achieve the most,"" they wrote. ""They are the one who spend more time than others in a state of flow.""

CNBC,https://www.cnbc.com/2024/06/28/biden-debate-trump-democrats-new-nominee-heres-how.html,2024-06-28,20:04:18 UTC,Biden debate flop leads Democrats to call for new nominee — but replacing him is tough to do,"U.S. President Joe Biden attends the first presidential debate hosted by CNN in Atlanta, Georgia, U.S., June 27, 2024. Marco Bello | Reuters

President Joe Biden's raspy, unfocused, often inarticulate and widely panned debate performance stoked deep anxiety among Democrats — and caused some commentators and fundraisers to openly call for a new nominee to run against former President Donald Trump. But replacing Biden as the party's pick less than five months out from Election Day carries enormous political risks and would be difficult, if not impossible, to pull off. Right now, the only likely way Biden could be replaced is if he willingly ends his campaign. And Biden's aides and top Democratic officials say the 81-year-old incumbent has no plans to do so. If he did drop out, Democrats have yet to identify a clear alternative candidate to swap in. But the panic among donors and party officials after watching Biden falter Thursday night in his debate against Trump has led some of them to take steps to get Biden out of the race. There are already discussions among Democratic fundraisers about trying to convince congressional leaders — Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer in particular — to urge Biden to announce to drop out, according to people familiar with the matter who were granted anonymity to speak freely.

Saul Loeb | AFP | Getty Images

Schumer, D-N.Y., is a top target for donors making that pitch because he privately has voiced concerns about Biden's standings in presidential election polls, those people said. Schumer was worried before the debate that Biden and Trump were statistically tied nationally, despite the Republican challenger's conviction in his New York criminal hush money trial. A spokesman for Schumer declined to comment to CNBC but pointed to a social media post the majority leader published after the debate. Schumer in that X post wrote: ""Tonight's debate made the choice clear: Four more years of progress, or four more years of attacks on our fundamental rights and our democracy."" ""We've got to get out the vote for Joe Biden, Kamala Harris, and a Democratic Senate and House!"" the post said. That spin has not alleviated the post-debate anxiety felt by some of the president's top fundraisers. Some of those wealthy donors have lost trust in Biden's team, believing they were given false assurances about Biden's ability to take on Trump. And some of those donors who already planned to attend a high-dollar fundraiser Saturday in the Hamptons section of Long Island say they will attend the event to judge for themselves whether Biden can continue as a viable candidate. ""Democrats are in a very difficult situation because it's late in the campaign for a change,"" said Meena Bose, director of the Peter S. Kalikow Center for the Study of the American Presidency at Hofstra University, in an interview with CNBC. The only feasible way Bose could see it playing out is with Biden throwing his full support behind Vice President Kamala Harris to become the new nominee.

Otherwise, Democrats have a wide-open nomination fight just a few months before the Nov. 5 election, she said. Bose called that a ""disastrous"" prospect."" ""Vice President Harris is a risky choice, but certainly has the visibility and is the logical choice,"" said Bose. ""It's difficult to see how you open up the Democratic presidential nomination now and have a unified path to victory in November,"" she added.

However, even if Biden backed Harris to replace him ahead of the Democratic National Convention in August, there is no guarantee that the delegates he has won so far will shift their support to her. Biden has won nearly all of the roughly 4,000 Democratic-pledged delegates, far exceeding the threshold to make him the party nominee. If Biden refuses to drop out before August, the only opportunity to boot him as nominee would be at the Democratic National Convention that month. It is technically possible that Biden's delegates could abandon him en masse then and throw open the convention to nominate another candidate. Some Democrats who want an alternative to Biden but are concerned about Harris' relatively low opinion polls and rocky campaign history have looked to California Gov. Gavin Newsom, Ohio Sen. Sherrod Brown, Illinois Gov. J.B. Pritzker and others as possible contenders.

But blocking Biden from the nomination is highly improbable, as delegates tend to be strong supporters of their chosen candidate. ""That is probably the worst-case scenario,"" Bose said. ""If the Democrats are going to have a change at the top of the ticket, President Biden has to endorse it and, frankly, probably initiate it."" The DNC rules allow for the party to select another presidential nominee, but only in the ""event of death, resignation or disability"" that leaves the role vacant.

The Financial Action Task Force, an international watchdog organization dedicated to combating money laundering and illicit cash flows, on Friday removed Turkey from its ""gray list"" of countries that need special monitoring, handing a major vote of confidence to the country in the midst of its economic turnaround efforts.

""The FATF welcomes Türkiye's significant progress in improving its AML/CFT regime,"" the Paris-based organization wrote in its latest report, using the Turkish government's spelling of its country's name and the acronym for anti-money laundering and combating the financing of terrorism.

It said that Turkey had strengthened the effectiveness of its AML/CFT regime to address ""deficiencies"" that FATF listed in its October 2021 monitoring report.

Those deficiencies included FATF concerns over unregistered money transfer services, insufficient resources dedicated to terrorist financing investigations, alleged involvement in sanctions evasion, lack of oversight on high-risk sectors used for money laundering such as banking and real estate, and insufficient oversight of nonprofit organizations that could be used for terrorist financing, among others.

The FATF in its 2021 report had found sectors like banking, construction and property in Turkey vulnerable to illicit financing of United Nations-sanctioned groups like the Islamic State and al-Qaeda.","As the sunsets, a ferry boat glides across the waters of the Golden Horn with the Suleymaniye Mosque and the city of Istanbul, Turkey in the background.

For the third year in a row, Vienna, the capital of Austria, is the world's most livable city, according to the Economist Intelligence Unit.

The annual report, which aims to show how comfortable or livable a city is, examined 173 cities globally based on 30 indicators organized into five categories: stability, health care, culture and environment, education and infrastructure.

Boosted by its perfect scores for stability, health care, education and infrastructure, Vienna led this year's list, followed closely by its Western European counterparts: Copenhagen, Denmark, in second place and Zurich, Switzerland, in third.

Vienna's overall score took a minor hit in the culture and environment categories, ""owing to a lack of major sporting events,"" according to the EIU Global Liveability Index for 2024.

""EIU's Liveability Index has risen fractionally over the past year,"" the report said. ""Declines in stability and infrastructure across a number of cities in advanced economies were offset by structural improvements in healthcare and education in several cities in developing markets.""

Here are the 10 most livable cities in the world, according to EIU.

Four Asia-Pacific cities made it to this year's top 10: Australian cities Melbourne and Sydney, as well as Osaka, Japan, and Auckland, New Zealand.

Melbourne, Sydney and Vancouver made the top 10 this year, but slipped ""amid a significant shortfall in housing availability,"" the EIU said. For the same reason, Toronto fell to 12th place this year, after ranking among the top 10 in the previous two years.

Western Europe was the best-performing region for livability globally, scoring an overall 92 out of 100. However, it has dropped since last year due to an increase in protests and crime, which weighed on the stability category, according to the report.

North America was the second best region, scoring an average of 90.5 out of 100, and ranking highest for education. The ongoing housing crisis in Canada has dragged down the region's infrastructure scores, EIU said.","Vienna, Austria is the wrold's most ""liveable"" city, according to the Economist Intelligence Unit's 2024 Global Liveability Index.

This report is from this week's CNBC's ""Inside India"" newsletter which brings you timely, insightful news and market commentary on the emerging powerhouse and the big businesses behind its meteoric rise. Like what you see? You can subscribe here.

A curry without onions would be considered blasphemous by much of India.

So, even a modest change in the price of the bulbous vegetable soon becomes the talking point around dinner tables for hundreds of millions of people in the country.

And it has been for the past year.

The price of raw onions has risen 165% over the past year, according to the Lasalgaon Agriculture Produce Market Committee, which is India's largest wholesale onion market. Prices have also inflated for other vegetables, such as tomatoes, which now cost nearly twice as much as this time last year.

Poor weather has been behind much of the havoc. The drought last year and the ongoing heatwave, which CNBC has previously reported on, have disrupted the supply of staple foods such as grains and vegetables.

Temperatures in large parts of the country are about 4 to 9 degrees Celsius (7.2 to 16.2 Fahrenheit) above average for this time of the year. The high heat has spoilt large amounts of recently harvested and stored vegetables and is threatening to stop the planting of a fresh batch of crops.

Food prices, which rose an annual 8.7% in both April and May, account for nearly half of the overall consumer price basket. The sharp rise in the cost of food has kept headline inflation above the central bank's target of 4%, preventing it from cutting interest rates.

""The Indian economy remains hostage to intersecting food price shocks,"" Michael Patra, deputy governor of the Reserve Bank of India, said in his statement at the latest monetary policy meeting. ""Food prices are holding back any consideration of possible changes in the monetary policy stance,"" he added.

Keeping rates elevated, though, appears to be ""an unacceptably high growth sacrifice,"" according to Jayanth Varma, another member of the central bank's monetary policy committee, who voted to cut rates. Politically, an economic slowdown is unlikely to bode well for the newly elected BJP-led coalition government.

The anxiety was palpable this week when the government announced limits on traders stockpiling wheat.

""Imposing stock limits was just one option. We have many other tools at our disposal to ensure that wheat prices do not rise abnormally,"" food secretary Sanjeev Chopra told reporters and added that there was no shortage of wheat in the country.

The government also has the option to remove import taxes — currently set at 40% on wheat — to hold prices down.

Yet, Prime Minister Narendra Modi is stuck in a bind if he wants to gain favor with the country's farmers ahead of elections in two large agricultural states scheduled for later this year.

Lowering tariffs would enable grains to be imported from wherever they are cheaper and bring down their cost within India, but it will also undercut profits for local farmers.

For now, the prime minister has instead opted to raise the price the government is willing to pay farmers by 5.4% to about $275 per metric ton of rice. These grains are then redistributed to low-income families at no cost, making it the world's biggest food welfare program.

There are signs that these cost pressures are unlikely to abate soon due to further bad weather. This week, at least 200,000 people have been affected by the floods in India's northeastern region, a key rice-growing area.

But, an elevated inflation and interest rate environment haven't appeared to deter companies or investors.

""You talk to Indian companies, and even with inflation at 6%, they barely bat an eyelid because they're growing at twice that or more,"" said James Thom, lead fund manager of the abrdn New India Investment Trust , which trades like an ETF in London. ""[They] are used to operating with that level of inflation for decades.""

""That's just the norm,"" he added.","A seller is arranging onions at a vegetable market in Nagaon district, in the northeastern state of Assam, India, on February 1, 2024.

CNBC,https://www.cnbc.com/2024/06/28/french-election-le-pens-far-right-national-rally-election-gains.html,2024-06-28,13:48:52 UTC,France's far right looks headed for victory in the first round at the polls. Here's what that means,"Jordan Bardella, President of the National Rally (Rassemblement National), a French nationalist and right-wing populist party, speaks to over 5,000 supporters at his final rally ahead of the upcoming European Parliament election on June 9th, at Le Dôme de Paris - Palais des Sports, on June 2, 2024., France, on June 2, 2024, in Paris, France.

With just days to go until France's snap parliamentary election kicks off, victory for the far right looks increasingly likely in the first phase of the two-stage runoff. Marine Le Pen's National Rally and its allies are seen winning 36% of votes, signaling growing support for the party's euroskeptic, anti-immigration agenda, according to the latest opinion polls from Elabe released ahead of the first vote on June 30. The left-wing New Popular Front, meanwhile, is projected behind with 27%, while President Emmanuel Macron's Renaissance party is predicted to clinch 20% of the support, as of June 27. The shift away from centrist politics has spooked investors and analysts, who warn of implications ranging from ""political paralysis"" to ""immediate financial crisis."" But predicting the outcome of France's final vote on July 7 is less clear cut, given the complexity of France's voting system. CNBC takes a look at the likelihood of a far-right French victory and the impact for markets.

A complex system

Under France's two-stage voting system, all parliamentary candidates who receive at least 12.5% of locally registered voters progress to the second-round runoff — a feat that the National Rally is likely to achieve in a large number of constituencies. But even with sweeping gains in the first round, the party could be stumped at the final hurdle by voters using ""le vote utile"" — or tactical voting — to keep them out. That was seen as part of Macron's gamble when the French leader called the surprise vote following the National Rally's record 31.3% gain in this month's European Parliament elections. Others say the president hopes to discredit his competitors ahead of France's 2027 presidential election, with Macron since claiming there will be ""civil war"" if either extreme wins. Voter turnout for the national election is also expected to be larger — and therefore more representative — than the 51% who cast their ballot in the EU vote. With that in mind, analysts see a 30% to 40% chance of the National Rally winning the 289 seats needed to secure an absolute majority in the 577-seat National Assembly. A more likely outcome, however, would be major gains for the far right, with the National Rally potentially becoming the biggest party in France, but ultimately falling short of a majority and leading to a highly divided hung parliament.

Market turmoil

Such a stalemate could leave France with lower trend growth, elevated yield spreads and a ""worse reputation globally,"" Holger Schmieding, chief economist at Berenberg Bank, told CNBC on Monday. Already, France's blue-chip CAC 40 index is heading for its worst month since May 2023, having lost as much as 6% since the vote was announced on June 9. The spread between French and German borrowing costs — a key indicator of French political risk — has also jumped to its widest in more than a decade. A majority government for either the far-right or the ultra-left alliance, meanwhile, could spark a far more dramatic outcome.

""Spendthrift agendas"" from either party — whose policies both include lowering the retirement age and cutting income tax — could result in an ""immediate financial crisis,"" Schmieding suggested. Citi analysts said in a note Thursday that markets were currently ""too optimistic"" about a benign outcome, adding that its higher probability scenarios of gridlock or an extreme parliament could lead to a 5% to 20% fall in French equity valuations. ""Combined with our finding that French equities tend to be more volatile than peers' around elections, this could be reason to expect additional choppiness from here,"" the analysts noted.

Political paralysis

The CEO of Paris-based Euronext, Europe's biggest stock exchange group, sought to quell investor concerns earlier this week, telling the Financial Times that neither the left nor the right would be able to implement their more extreme policies amid checks and balances from the president, ratings agencies and the European Union. On Monday, Jordan Bardella — Le Pen's 28-year-old protege, who could become prime minister under a strong showing for the National Rally — was seen stepping back on some more extreme measures, vowing to implement ""reasonable"" spending plans. That includes an aim to bring France's deficit back to the EU limit of 3% of GDP. Even with more measured fiscal plans, however, parliamentary gridlock could make such policies difficult to enact. Bardella, for his part, has recently stressed that he would ""need an absolute majority to govern,"" in a bid to boost his backing. ""You start with deficit at 5.5%, debt at 110%, you're unable to do anything for the next three years, which means that deficits are just not coming down. To me that's the biggest issue that France faces right now,"" Jefferies' chief financial economist for Europe, Mohit Kumar, told CNBC's ""Squawk Box Europe"" on Tuesday.","Nurphoto | Getty ImagesWith just days to go until France's snap parliamentary election kicks off, victory for the far right looks increasingly likely in the first phase of the two-stage runoff.

Nike CEO John Donahoe appears to be on thin ice. The former top executive of eBay , who has been at the helm of Nike since January 2020, is starting to lose Wall Street's confidence after the company capped off a lackluster fiscal year with more bad news. On Thursday, Nike warned that sales in its current quarter were expected to decline by a staggering 10% – far worse than the 3.2% drop LSEG had projected – after it posted its slowest annual sales gain in 14 years, excluding the Covid-19 pandemic. The company also said it expects fiscal 2025 sales to be down mid-single digits when it previously expected them to grow. The warning signs led shares to close 20% lower on Friday -- making it the worst trading day in the company's history since its IPO in Dec. 1980. The plunge wiped about $28 billion off of Nike's market cap, bringing it to just under $114 billion from $142 billion a day earlier. As Wall Street digested the dismal outlook from the world's largest sportswear company, at least six investment banks downgraded Nike's stock. Analysts at Morgan Stanley and Stifel took it a step further, specifically calling the company's management into question. ""The FY25 guide (the 5th downward consensus revision in 6 quarters), pushes prospects for growth inflection further into 2025 (perhaps FY4Q or spring '25 at the earliest) asking investors to both underwrite success of not yet proven styles and look across an uncertain consumer discretionary backdrop into 2HCY24 until momentum could build again into 2HCY25,"" wrote Stifel analyst Jim Duffy. ""Management credibility is severely challenged and potential for C-level regime change adds further uncertainty.""

Stock Chart Icon Stock chart icon Nike stock has underperformed the S&P 500 during CEO John Donahoe's tenure.

Since Donahoe took over as Nike's top executive, its stock is down more than 25% as of Friday's close, significantly underperforming both the S&P 500 and the XRT – the retail-focused ETF – which saw gains of around 67% and 66% in that time period, respectively. Nike finance chief Matt Friend on Thursday attributed the guidance cut to a host of factors. Some, like softness in China and challenging foreign exchange headwinds, are outside of Nike's control, but others are problems it squarely created under Donahoe's leadership. The company is expecting wholesale orders to be slow as it scales new styles, pulls back on classic franchises and works to repair its relationships with key retail partners after spending the last few years cutting them off in favor of a direct-selling strategy. At the same time, loyal customers who shop on Nike's website are no longer springing for new pairs of Air Force 1s, Air Jordan 1s or Dunks, the company's core franchises. Critics say the sneaker lines have dominated the retailer's offerings for too long and turned customers away as they sought fresh styles and innovative designs from a slew of upstart competitors. That's left Nike to win back some of its most essential customers – runners. As the retailer focused on its direct-selling strategy at the expense of innovation, scrappy competitors like On Running and Hoka snatched up market share.","In this article NKE Follow your favorite stocks CREATE FREE ACCOUNTJohn Donahoe, attends the first day of the annual Allen & Company Sun Valley Conference, in Sun Valley, Idaho.

ATTA KENARE | AFP

Iran is voting for its next president Friday in a snap election following the unexpected death of former President Ebrahim Raisi in a helicopter crash — and the outcome could have implications far beyond its borders. While there was no clear frontrunner leading up to the vote, all but one of the six candidates approved to run are conservative hardliners — and half of them have been sanctioned by Western governments. Of the six initial contenders, four remain in the race after two dropped out on Thursday. If there is no clear majority after Friday's vote, the top two candidates face a second round of voting on July 5. The winner will serve for four years — and faces no shortage of challenges. The election comes at a fraught time for the country of 88 million, and turnout is expected to be low. Iranians will go to the polls against the backdrop of a battered economy, widespread popular discontent and harsh crackdowns on dissent. Iran is also dealing with high inflation, heavy Western sanctions, mounting tensions with the U.S., ramped-up Iranian nuclear enrichment and the Israel-Hamas war. Voting is open to roughly 61 million eligible Iranians, but many have pledged to boycott, pointing out the lack of genuine choice for voters. Iran's ultra-conservative Guardian Council controls who is allowed on the ballot and only approved six candidates to run for the presidency, out of a list of 80 registrants.

Most of the candidates are hardliners who hold staunch anti-Western positions, with just one representing the reformist camp. Women who had registered to run were all disqualified by the Council. Iran's last presidential and parliamentary elections in 2021 and March 2024, respectively, saw the lowest recorded voter turnout in the Islamic Republic's history. Many observers expect that trend to continue. ""In the past, the government has put great emphasis on participation to claim popular legitimacy as a republic ... the decline in turnout over the last several years underscores the public's growing disillusionment with the system,"" Iran analysts Ali Vaez and Naysan Rafat at the think tank Crisis Group wrote in a report. ""Many citizens have come to doubt that they can produce meaningful change through the ballot box,"" they wrote. ""A major reversal of that trend appears unlikely.""

Who is running?

Two candidates appear to be leading the race, according to national polls: Mohammad Bagher Qalibaf and Saeed Jalili, both staunch conservatives. The candidate field features only one reformist candidate, Masoud Pezeshkian. Two of the six initial contenders, Amirhossein Ghazizadeh Hashemi and Alireza Zakani, dropped out of the race on Thursday. Mohammad Bagher Qalibaf: Iran's current speaker of Parliament and a former Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC) commander, Qalibaf also previously served as mayor of Tehran and has already made three attempts at running for the presidency. Saeed Jalili: A former nuclear negotiator, Jalili currently serves as a representative for supreme leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei on the Supreme National Security Council, known to be the most hardline wing of the regime. Jalili is further on the right politically than Qalibaf and a longtime Iranian government insider, but has also had several failed attempts at running for office. Masoud Pezeshkian: The sole reformist candidate in the field, Pezeshkian formerly served as minister of health and has been a parliament member since 2008. He is a member of the Islamic Consultative Assembly and the vice speaker of Parliament, and wants to loosen social restrictions like Iran's strict hijab law and improve relations with the West, including potentially re-starting nuclear talks with world powers. Mostafa Pourmohammadi: The only cleric in the race, Pourmohammadi formerly served as a prosecutor of the Revolutionary Court and deputy minister in Iran's Ministry of Intelligence, working under both conservative and reformist presidencies.

Where the real power lies

Iran's next president will have to contend with whoever takes the White House in November. This raises the stakes for both Tehran and Washington, as well as the Middle East writ large, as Iran comes closer than ever to nuclear bomb-production capability and continues to back proxy groups fighting Israel. On issues of foreign policy and war, the Iranian president wields some influence and is the country's public-facing messenger. But power and critical decision-making in Iran ultimately lies with the supreme leader, Ayatollah Khamenei, and unelected institutions like the Revolutionary Guards.

Amazon is ramping up its development of artificial intelligence technology, hiring top talent from AI agent startup Adept and licensing the company's technology.

Rohit Prasad, a senior vice president and head scientist who oversees Amazon's artificial general intelligence unit, wrote in a memo to employees on Friday that the company hired Adept co-founder and CEO David Luan and ""a few other deeply talented team members to our AGI team.""

Luan will oversee Amazon's ""AGI Autonomy"" division, and report to Prasad, he wrote in the memo, which CNBC obtained. Amazon confirmed the contents of the memo. Geekwire was first to report on it.

Amazon faces fierce competition in AI, as rivals Microsoft and Google rapidly add new features into their core products while also giving businesses more ways to access large language models in their public cloud offerings. Amazon's cloud unit has launched a range of AI services, including its own models, which are generally viewed as lagging behind the top competitors.

Amazon has also pumped billions of dollars into OpenAI competitor Anthropic, and it's planning to overhaul its Alexa voice assistant with a new paid version that has generative AI capabilities. Prasad, who previously served as a head scientist for Alexa, was tapped in August to steer Amazon's development of AGI, or software that's significantly more advanced than current AI and starts to approach human-level capabilities.

Last month, Amazon announced Adam Selipsky, the head of Amazon Web Services, would be stepping down and succeeded by Matt Garman, the head of sales at marketing at AWS.","The front desk of the Amazon office is pictured in New York, May 1, 2019.

JPMorgan Chase and Morgan Stanley said Friday that they were boosting both dividend payouts and share repurchases, while rivals Citigroup and Bank of America made more modest announcements.

JPMorgan, the biggest U.S. bank by assets, said it was raising its quarterly dividend 8.7% to $1.25 per share and that it authorized a new $30 billion share repurchase program.

Morgan Stanley, a dominant player in wealth management, said it was boosting its dividend 8.8% to 92.5 cents per share and authorized a $20 billion repurchase plan.

Citigroup said it was raising its dividend 5.7% to 56 cents per share and that it would ""continue to assess share repurchases"" on a quarterly basis.

Bank of America said it was increasing its dividend 8% to 26 cents per share. Its release made no mention of share repurchases.

The big banks announced their plans to boost capital return to shareholders after passing the annual stress test administered by the Federal Reserve this week. While all 31 banks in this year's exam showed regulators they could withstand a severe hypothetical recession, JPMorgan said Wednesday that it could have higher losses than the Fed initially found.

Still, that would not affect its capital-return plan, the New York-based bank said Friday.

""The strength of our company allows us to continually invest in building our businesses for the future, pay a sustainable dividend, and return any remaining excess capital to our shareholders as we see fit,"" JPMorgan CEO Jamie Dimon said in his company's release.

CNBC,https://www.cnbc.com/2024/06/28/may-pce-inflation-report.html,2024-06-28,19:35:23 UTC,"Key Fed measure shows inflation rose 2.6% in May from a year ago, as expected","Including food and energy, headline inflation was flat on the month and also up 2.6% on an annual basis. Those readings also were in line with expectations.

Both numbers were in line with the Dow Jones estimates. May marked the lowest annual rate since March 2021, which was the first time in this economic cycle that inflation topped the Fed's 2% target.

The core personal consumption expenditures price index increased just a seasonally adjusted 0.1% for the month and was up 2.6% from a year ago, the latter number down 0.2 percentage point from the April level, according to a Commerce Department report .

An important economic measure for the Federal Reserve showed Friday that inflation during May slowed to its lowest annual rate in more than three years.

""It is just additional news that monetary policy is working, inflation is gradually cooling,"" San Francisco Fed President Mary Daly told CNBC's Andrew Ross Sorkin during a ""Squawk Box"" interview. ""That's a relief for businesses and households who've been struggling with persistently high inflation. It's good news for how policy is working.""

The Fed focuses on the PCE inflation reading as opposed to the more widely followed consumer price index from the Labor Department's Bureau of Labor Statistics. PCE is a broader inflation measure and accounts for changes in consumer behavior, such as substituting their purchases when prices rise.

While the central bank officially follows headline PCE, officials generally stress the core reading as a better gauge of longer-term inflation trends.

Outside of the inflation numbers, the Bureau of Economic Analysis report showed that personal income rose 0.5% on the month, stronger than the 0.4% estimate. Consumer spending, however, increased 0.2%, weaker than the 0.3% forecast.

Prices were held in check during the month by a 0.4% decline for goods and a 2.1% slide in energy, which offset a 0.2% increase in services and a 0.1% gain for food.

However, housing prices continued to rise, up 0.4% on the month for the fourth straight time. Shelter-related costs have proven stickier than Federal Reserve officials have anticipated and have helped keep the central bank from reducing interest rates as expected this year.

Stock market futures were modestly positive following the report while Treasury yields were negative on the session.

Investors have been trying to handicap the Fed's intentions on rates this year and have had to scale back expectations. Whereas traders earlier in 2024 had been expecting at least six rate cuts this year they are now pricing in just two, starting in September. Fed officials at their June meeting penciled in just one reduction this year.

""The lack of surprise in today's PCE number is a relief and will be welcomed by the Fed,"" said Seema Shah, chief global strategist at Principal Asset Management. ""However, the policy path is not yet certain. A further deceleration in inflation, ideally coupled with additional evidence of labor market softening, will be necessary to pave the way for a first rate cut in September.""

The Fed targets 2% inflation and began raising interest rates in March 2022 after a year of dismissing rising prices as transitory effects from the Covid pandemic that likely would fade. The central bank last raised rates in July 2023 after taking its benchmark overnight borrowing level to a range of 5.25%-5.50%, the highest in some 23 years.

Recent economic data has painted a picture of an economy that has withstood the Fed's aggressive monetary tightening. Gross domestic product rose at a 1.4% annualized rate in the first quarter and is on pace to increase 2.2% in the second quarter, according to the Atlanta Fed.

There have been some slight cracks in the labor market lately, with continuing jobless claims hitting their highest level since November 2021. However, the unemployment rate is still 4%, low by historical means though also rising at a slow pace.","Including food and energy, headline inflation was flat on the month and also up 2.6% on an annual basis.

Warren Buffett on Friday made his biggest annual donation to date, giving $5.3 billion worth of Berkshire Hathaway shares to five charities.

The legendary investor, who's turning 94 in August, converted 8,674 of his Berkshire Class A shares to donate more than 13 million Class B shares, according to a statement Friday. A total of 9.93 million shares went to the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation, with the rest going to the Susan Thompson Buffett Foundation, named for his late first wife, and the three charities led by his children Howard, Susan and Peter Buffett.

The ""Oracle of Omaha"" has pledged to give away the fortune he built at Berkshire, the Omaha, Nebraska-based conglomerate he started running in 1965. Buffett has been making annual donations to the five charities since 2006.

After Friday's donations, Buffett owns 207,963 Berkshire A shares and 2,586 B shares, worth about $130 billion.

New charitable trust

In an interview with The Wall Street Journal, Buffett clarified that after his death, the enormous fortune he amassed from building the one-of-a-kind conglomerate will be directed to a new charitable trust overseen by his three children.

""It should be used to help the people that haven't been as lucky as we have been,"" he told the Journal. ""There's eight billion people in the world, and me and my kids, we've been in the luckiest 100th of 1% or something. There's lots of ways to help people.""

Buffett has previously said his three children are the executors of his will as well as the named trustees of the charitable trust that will receive 99%-plus of his wealth.

He told the Journal that the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation will no longer receive donations after his death. Buffett resigned as a trustee at the Gates Foundation in June 2021 in the midst of Bill and Melinda Gates' divorce.

At Berkshire's annual meeting in May, Buffett spoke candidly to shareholders about a future when he's no longer at the helm, appearing solemn at times as he pondered his advanced age and reflected on his late friend and business partner Charlie Munger.

Greg Abel, vice chairman for noninsurance operations at Berkshire, has been named Buffett's successor and has taken on most of the responsibility at the conglomerate.

Buffett previously said his will will be made public after his death.

""After my death, the disposition of my assets will be an open book – no 'imaginative' trusts or foreign entities to avoid public scrutiny but rather a simple will available for inspection at the Douglas County Courthouse,"" Buffett said in November.","Warren Buffett speaks during the Berkshire Hathaway Annual Shareholders Meeting in Omaha, Nebraska on May 4, 2024.

China: 'Starkly different visions' of America

China's CGTN, the English-language service of state-run China Global Television Network, said: ""Biden started hesitantly and Trump answered steadily in a halting clash."" Accusations of lies and that each of them was the worst-ever U.S. president, were rife, the outlet said. Meanwhile, the South China Morning Post said that the two ""presented starkly different visions for America's place in the world,"" and that it was a ""high-stakes debate."" Before it kicked off, China's state-backed tabloid Global Times said it was expected to be ""like a reality show.""

India: 'Democrats in full-blown panic'

The Times of India led its story with concerns from Democrats about Biden's performance, with the headline reading: ""'We are f***ed': Democrats in full-blown panic over Joe Biden's debate performance."" Biden ""delivered a shaky, halting performance,"" it said, while ""Trump battered him with a series of often false attacks."" Elsewhere, India Today said Biden ""stammered and fumbled"" multiple times, while describing Trump's performance as ""forceful and aggressive.""

UK: 'Biden struggles ... Trump lies'

In the U.K., the Guardian pointed to issues with both Biden and Trump at the debate, headlining its story: ""Biden struggles to land lines as Trump lies in first presidential debate."" Many of Trump's replies to straightforward questions had little to do with the topic at hand, the paper said, and he made frequent false claims which were not fact-checked by the moderators. Biden, meanwhile, ""frequently struggled to complete his thoughts."" The Times of London said that Biden's reelection campaign was ""plunged into crisis"" following the debate and that the current president's responses to questions were ""meandering and muddled,"" while Trump's were ""more assured and disciplined."" Meanwhile, the BBC suggested Biden struggled with Trump's attacks, titling its live blog of the debate: ""Biden stumbles in first presidential debate as Trump avoids key questions."" Biden struggled repeatedly and Trump repeated falsehoods, it said, adding that the debate was ""marked by personal attacks.""

Germany: 'True losers ... are the Americans'

Germany's broadcaster ZDF described the debate as ""more civilized"" but ""more charged"" than in 2020, adding that Trump had a better start, but Biden caught up later on, according to a CNBC translation. At first, Biden did not appear very agile and hesitated, it said, but added that his tone was ""somewhat surprisingly"" as aggressive and sharp as Trump's. On individual topics, Biden had ""clear words"" for Trump when it came to abortion, but things got ""uncomfortable"" for him on immigration — while Trump tried to dodge questions about the January 2021 Capitol Hill riot.

Sueddeutsche Zeitung, meanwhile, titled one of its stories: ""Joe Biden's bad evening,"" saying that even though his answers had more substance than Trump's, Biden's verbal stumbling raised concerns.

The U.S. Federal Reserve and European Central Bank could move to cut interest rates in September as key data provides further signs that inflation is cooling in the U.S. and the euro zone, a Morgan Stanley strategist said Friday.

Andrew Sheets, managing director and head of cross-asset strategy, told CNBC that the bank had grown bullish about the prospect of dual cuts, amid recent consumer price index and labor market data in the U.S. and Europe.

""We're more optimistic that both the Fed and ECB will cut rates in September,"" he told ""Squawk Box Europe.""

The two central banks showed signs of monetary policy divergence earlier this month, as the ECB implemented its first interest rate cut in almost five years, while the Fed insisted that U.S. inflation remains too high to take a similar step.

""It's understandable that these central banks don't want to pre-commit. They don't want to sound overly complacent about the risks of inflation,"" Sheets said.

""But we think the data that the ECB will see by September is inflation [is] continuing to moderate. And I think, for the Fed, inflation is continuing to fall,"" he added.

Euro zone inflation surprised to the upside in May, rising by 0.2 percentage point on a month-on-month basis to hit 2.6%. Fluctuations had been expected, due to base effects from the energy market and the unwinding of government support across the bloc.

U.S. inflation, meanwhile, held steady in May but was up 3.3% from a year ago, the latest CPI data showed earlier this month. That was an improvement on the 0.1% monthly gain economists had expected.

Markets are now watching out for May's core personal consumption expenditures price index, the Fed's preferred inflation gauge, due Friday morning.

Analysts expect the headline PCE to be flat from April and 2.6% higher on the year. Excluding volatile food and energy prices, the core PCE is forecast to come in 0.1% higher month on month, which Sheets said was also in line with his expectations.

A majority of economists polled by Reuters now anticipate the Fed will cut interest rates from its current range of 5.25% to 5.50% this September, with a further trim projected later in the year. The ECB is also expected to cut rates in September and December.","The U.S. Federal Reserve and European Central Bank could move to cut interest rates in September as key data provides further signs that inflation is cooling in the U.S. and the euro zone, a Morgan Stanley strategist said Friday.

CNBC,https://www.cnbc.com/2024/06/28/biden-democratic-fundraisers-sound-alarm-on-debate.html,2024-06-28,17:00:19 UTC,Top Democratic fundraisers sound the alarm after Biden's debate performance,"President Joe Biden delivers remarks during the CNN Presidential Debate at the CNN Studios on June 27, 2024 in Atlanta, Georgia.

""Biden's got to leave. He's got to get out now and if he doesn't get out we're going to get f------ crushed,"" said the advisor. They told CNBC they planned to approach Democratic National Committee Chairman Jaime Harrison on Friday to discuss what happened at the debate.

""Game over,"" said a longtime Democratic campaign advisor, who has been raising money for congressional leaders for over a decade and helped raise money for Biden's 2020 White House bid.

CNBC began hearing from worried Democratic campaign donors and fundraisers less than 20 minutes into the 90-minute debate hosted by CNN.

""This is terrible. Worse than I thought was possible. Everyone I'm speaking with thinks Biden should drop out,"" said the person, who was granted anonymity in order to recount private conversations.

""Disaster,"" said a Biden donor who plans to attend a fundraiser with the president on Saturday in the Hamptons .

Many of the Democratic Party's top fundraisers are privately sounding the alarm after President Joe Biden 's disappointing debate performance Thursday against Republican former President Donald Trump .

An advisor of one of the Democratic Party's top megadonors called the debate an ""absolute train wreck"" for Biden. ""Worse than [Ronald] Reagan in '84 or [George W.] Bush in '04 or [Barack] Obama in '12,"" they added.

The problems for Biden at the debate started early. He stumbled out of the gate, appearing to lose his train of thought at times and pausing for a long moment before CNN moderators cut him off when he was discussing U.S. health care.

""Making sure that we're able to make every single solitary person eligible for what I've been able to do with the, with the Covid, excuse me, with dealing with everything we have to do with, look ..."" Biden said, trailing off.

""Look, if, we've finally beat Medicare,"" Biden said, before CNN anchor and moderator Jack Tapper gently moved on. ""Thank you, President Biden,"" said Tapper.

Several times later in the debate, the president repeated himself, or left several seconds of silence mid-answer. Throughout the evening, Biden's voice was raspy and quiet.

Biden's campaign co-chair Mitch Landrieu told NBC News this was because the president had a cold. ""I think because of the way people analyze debates, it's going to be at first about the physical performance,"" said Landrieu.

Even Vice President Kamala Harris acknowledged that Biden was not in top form. ""Yes, it was a slow start, but it was a strong finish,"" she said on CNN late Thursday.

For example, answering a question about border security — a top voter issue this election cycle — Biden's sentence was grammatically difficult to follow.

""I'm going to continue to move until we get the total ban on the total initiative relative to what we're going to do with more Border Patrol and more asylum officers,"" Biden said.

Trump pounced on the stumbles. ""I don't know what he said at the end of that sentence. I don't think he knows what he said, either,"" the former president quipped.

Representatives for the Biden campaign did not respond to requests for comment.

Replacing Biden on the ticket now would be extremely difficult, with less than two months until the Democratic National Convention in August. The president would effectively have to drop out of the race, leaving the decision about a nominee up to the delegates at the convention.

""It was a really disappointing debate performance from Joe Biden, I don't think there's any other way to slice it,"" Kate Bedingfield, former White House communications director in the Biden administration until 2023, said on CNN.

""His biggest issue was to prove to the American people that he had the energy, the stamina — and he didn't do that,"" she said.","President Joe Biden delivers remarks during the CNN Presidential Debate at the CNN Studios on June 27, 2024 in Atlanta, Georgia.

The Russian leader was invoked roughly a dozen times in the 90-minute volley of verbal blows on domestic and foreign policy between the two candidates. Both have navigated the White House relationship with the Kremlin for a mandate each and shared very different views of the Russian leader.

Trump — who has denied accusations that Moscow interfered in his favor in the 2016 election — claimed that Putin would be deterred from conflict if he respected the leadership of opposing global superpowers.

""As far as Russia and Ukraine, if we had a real president, a president that knew — that was respected by Putin, he would have never — he would have never invaded Ukraine,"" Trump said, according to a CNN transcript of the debate.

Dubbing Ukrainian leader Volodymyr Zelenskyy as ""the greatest salesman ever,"" Trump again criticized the extent of U.S. financial support for Kyiv throughout the conflict. Two months ago, Washington approved a foreign aid bill that earmarked roughly $60 billion for the war-torn country.

""I will have that war settled between Putin and Zelenskyy as president-elect before I take office on January 20th. I'll have that war settled,"" Trump said, without disclosing any details.

Trump said, however, that Putin's latest demands for peace negotiations to begin — which include the withdrawal of Kyiv's forces from Ukrainian territories illegally annexed by Russia — are ""not acceptable.""

In a separate pledge, Trump vowed to ensure the release of Wall Street Journal reporter Evan Gershkovich, who was detained in Russia in March 2023 and now faces trial on charges of espionage.

""I will have him out very quickly, as soon as I take office, before I take office,"" Trump said, noting that Putin is ""probably asking for billions of dollars for the reporter."" The Russian leader has previously signaled interest in a potential prisoner swap for Gershkovich, rather than in financial compensation.

LONDON — Harmful E.coli bacteria has been discovered at ""alarmingly high"" levels in the U.K.'s River Thames just days before elite rowers are due to compete there for the international Henley Regatta, anti-pollution campaigners have warned.

From Tuesday onwards, around 4,000 rowers from across the globe are set to compete in 400 races to qualify for the iconic regatta, which has taken place along the waterway since 1839.

Water quality testing carried out by River Action campaign group ahead of the race, found E.coli bacteria up to 27 times the acceptable limit for bathing water, prompting health concerns following a rise in E.coli cases in the country.

E.coli is a diverse group of bacteria which, while usually harmless, can produce toxins that can cause severe illness.

River Action tested water in the Henley Mile — part of the regatta course outside the Oxfordshire town — 27 times between May 23 and June 25 and found an average of 1,213 E.coli colony forming units (CFUs) per 100ml of water. It warned the levels were ""alarmingly high"" in a Thursday statement.

Anything above 900 CFUs/100ml fails the Environment Agency's inland bathing water quality standards and is deemed a threat to public health, the campaign group said.

More than half (47%) of readings were found to be above the acceptable limit. The highest recorded was 25,000 CFUs/100ml, more than 27 times higher.

River Action also found E.coli levels up to 10 times higher in March tests.

James Wallace, CEO of River Action, accused the government and Thames Water, which manages water supply in the area, of failing to appropriately manage water hygiene levels.

""This is a health emergency. The new government must get a grip of the water pollution crisis and ensure that water companies, including Thames Water, invest urgently in upgrading wastewater treatment plants and fix their leaky infrastructure before someone becomes seriously ill, or worse,"" he said in a statement.

Thames Water did not immediately respond to CNBC's request for comment, though the BBC reported that it had dubbed the findings ""alarmist"" and said it was monitoring bacteria levels. CNBC also contacted the government's environment agency but did not immediately receive a response.

Chair of the Henley Royal Regatta committee of management and former Olympic rower Sir Steve Redgrave, said the findings were a ""stark reminder"" of the impact of sewage pollution.

""Our waterways are vitally important to our competitors racing, but also to all those athletes training on a daily basis nationwide,"" he said.

Regatta organizers have advised rowers to cover all cuts and blisters and avoid swallowing river water as thousands of spectators descend on Henley on Thames for the event, which runs until Sunday.

It comes as the U.K. has faced a rise in E.coli cases. Two people with underlying health conditions died following infection with the Shiga-toxin-producing E. coli strain (STEC). One of the deaths is ""likely linked"" to their STEC infection, the UK Health Security Agency (UKHSA) said.

That particular strain is thought to have been spread via lettuce leaves within pre-packaged sandwiches.

UKHSA said Thursday that 275 cases of the strain have been confirmed as of June 25, and urged people to watch out for symptoms which can include diarrhoea, stomach cramps, vomiting and fever.","Spectators watch a race on the River Thames at the Henley Royal Regatta in Henley-on-Thames, west of London, on June 30, 2023.

Indian government bonds reached a major milestone on Friday with their inclusion in JPMorgan's emerging market government bond index.

But for some fixed-income investors it might be seen as more of a relief than an occasion to celebrate after a challenging few years for the asset class.

Take the broad L&G India Government Bond exchange-traded fund, for instance. The index has a total return of 4.08% this year, but that's hiding the fact that these bonds have been underwater since their 2021 highs until May this year.

Anticipating the Wall Street bank's decision, alongside Bloomberg's move to include India in a similar index next year, markets have partly pushed up bond prices in 2024 despite the risks of inflation reigniting. About $20 billion to $40 billion is now expected to flow into the country, chasing limited supply.

While these moves by big Wall Street institutions might be lucrative for investors today, it's likely to dampen their returns over the longer term.

After all, as bond prices rise their yields fall. The days of being paid between 8% to 10% to invest in such securities might be truly numbered. Over the past few weeks, yields have hovered around the 7% mark.

And that's also what India's government will be hoping for.","(Photo by Ajay Aggarwal/Hindustan Times via Getty Images)Indian government bonds reached a major milestone on Friday with their inclusion in JPMorgan's emerging market government bond index.

The Japanese yen weakened to fresh 38-year lows on Friday, crossing the 161 mark against the dollar for the first time since 1986 and reaching a high of 161.27, according to LSEG data. The last time the currency was at this level was in December 1986. The currency has struggled and again weakened past the 160 level on Thursday. The yen has been steadily deprecating since the Bank of Japan ended its negative interest rate policy and scrapped its yield curve control policy in March. Following the move, the currency crossed the 150 mark against the dollar, reaching 160 in late April before the country's finance ministry intervened.

Japan's finance ministry confirmed that it intervened between April 26 to May 29 to the tune of 9.7885 trillion yen ($62.25 billion). Dong Chen, chief Asia strategist and head of Asia research at Swiss private bank Pictet, said that he still expects the yen to stay ""fairly weak"" despite warnings of intervention from Japanese officials. ""To be very honest, actually, I don't think that the Japanese authorities can do a lot about [the] yen, and the market has shown that. Because despite all the verbal interventions, or actual interventions that Japan Ministry of Finance has done over the past, they didn't manage to stop the slide of [the] yen."" Dong explained that this is because the interest rate differential between the U.S. and Japan remains very wide, and this will keep the yen weak unless this differential is depressed ""more notably."" The benchmark U.S. federal funds rate stands at 5.25% to 5.5%, while the Bank of Japan's benchmark interest rate is at 0%-0.1%.

CNBC,https://www.cnbc.com/2024/06/28/younger-generations-of-asians-are-spending-big-on-art.html,2024-06-28,06:42:43 UTC,Younger generations of Asians are spending big on art,"Younger, wealthy shoppers in Asia are splashing their cash on art, according to a longtime collector and senior auction house executive. Nicolas Chow, Sotheby's chairman for Asia, said more than 40% of its buyers of contemporary art are millennials (born between 1981 and 1996), while Gen X (1965 to 1980) are also likely to be big spenders, he said. ""The buyers are increasingly younger. What we've seen actually in 2023 … Gen X is the most important buy-base actually — over a million dollars, they dominate the market,"" Chow told CNBC's ""Art of Appreciation."" Gen Z — the youngest age group for buyers — is ""coming in quite strongly,"" he said, adding that he recently saw a 20-year-old buyer acquire a piece in Shanghai to celebrate his graduation. Wealthy millennials in Asia spent a median of $59,785 on art and antiques during the first half of 2023, while for Gen Zers the figure was $56,000, according to the Art Basel & UBS Survey of Global Collecting 2023. Buying at auction — instead of from a dealer, for example — is popular with millennials and Gen X collectors globally, according to the survey. The trend appears to be playing out in Asia. At Christie's Hong Kong spring season auction, held between May 25 and June 1, around a quarter of buyers were new to the auction house, and 43% of those were millennials, according to an online release.

And, while the size of the global art market fell 4% last year to around $65 billion, according to the Art Basel & UBS Art Market Report 2024, sales in China rose by 9% in 2023, overtaking the U.K. as the world's second-largest art market. ""Activity surged as post-lockdown buyers snapped up backlogged auction inventories and as Hong Kong's major fairs and exhibitions returned to full-scale programming,"" wrote report author and founder of Arts Economics, Clare McAndrew. For Sotheby's, the rise in younger buyers is driven in part by an increase in online activity. ""During the pandemic, we really sort of developed our digital abilities with live streaming ... And this has really brought in art to the greater communities and allowed us to engage with our buyers across the world,"" Chow said. Younger collectors are keen on newer art forms, with Gen Z collectors having the highest average expenditure on digital art globally — as well as prints — of any generation, according to the Survey of Global Collecting 2023.

Young digital artists

For Angelle Siyang-Le, director of the Art Basel fair in Hong Kong, artists who work in digital media are becoming more prominent. ""The definition of digital art nowadays has been expanded from simply photography to video art to NFTs to AI-generated art,"" she told CNBC's ""Art of Appreciation.""



An NFT, or non-fungible token, is a unique digital asset stored on the blockchain. Sales of art-related NFTs were $1.2 billion in 2023, less than half the $2.9 billion peak in 2021 — though still significantly higher than 2020 sales, which were $20 million, according to the Art Market Report 2024. ""With the younger generations becoming more and more prominent in the market ... digital artists ... will be the group of artists getting more attention,"" Siyang-Le added. Hong Kong-based artist Mak2 uses a variety of mediums in her work, including Instagram videos. Her 2017 work, ""You Better Watch Out,"" an inflatable, transparent ""snow globe,"" featured floating QR codes that the audience could scan. CCTV cameras filmed people scanning the codes, which linked to a web page that showed the audience looking at the artwork. ""So you are watching yourself being watched,"" Mak2 told CNBC's Art of Appreciation. ""You're not just looking at your phone, you're becom[ing] data circulat[ing] inside the app and being recorded and analyzed,"" she added.

This is reportedly the first time Indian government bonds have been included in a global index.

India has seen foreign inflows to the tune of about $10 billion into its bond market over the past nine months since the announcement, Puneet Pal, head of fixed income at PGIM India Mutual Fund, told CNBC ""Street Signs Asia.""

Last September, JPMorgan said the inclusion of Indian bonds in its Government Bond Index-Emerging Markets will be staggered over 10 months, starting from a 1% weightage in June to a maximum 10% in April next year.

Deepak Agrawal, chief investment officer of debt at Kotak Mutual Fund, told CNBC earlier this year that he expected the inclusion to generate ""stable flows of around $25 [billion] to $30 billion"" over the next 12 to 18 months following the rebalancing period starting in June 2024.

Pal said that over the medium- to long-term, the inclusion of Indian government bonds will have a positive impact across the bond markets.

Honor

HANGZHOU, China — The transforming power of artificial intelligence is of no value unless user data is protected, CEO of Chinese smartphone company Honor, George Zhao, told CNBC in an exclusive interview on Thursday. His comments come as Apple this month announced it will start rolling out personalized AI tools on certain devices in the U.S. this fall. Honor already integrates some AI functions, such as enabling users to open text messages and other notifications just by looking at them, or eliminating copy-paste steps by directly linking Yelp-like apps to navigation or ride-hailing apps. This week at Mobile World Congress in Shanghai, Honor unveiled new AI tools for detecting the use of deepfakes in videos, and for simulating lenses that can decrease myopia during long hours of screen usage. Zhao emphasized that Honor's approach is to keep AI operations involving personal data limited to the smartphone. It's also known as on-device AI, and stands in contrast with AI tools that tap cloud computing to operate.

""Without data security and user privacy protection, AI will become worthless,"" Zhao said in Mandarin, translated by CNBC. ""This has always been one of our value propositions."" ""We say user data doesn't leave [the device],"" Zhao said. ""This is a principle we adhere to."" Apple Intelligence, the iPhone company's AI product, claims that it uses on-device processing and draws on ""server-based models"" for more complex requests. Apple said its new ""Private Cloud Compute"" never stores user data. Honor says its on-device AI is self-developed, and the company is working with Baidu and Google Cloud for some other AI features. ""Overall, my view is that AI's development to date has two directions,"" Zhao said. ""Network [cloud] AI has become more and more powerful. But I believe on-device AI, in its capabilities and empowerment of consumers, will become more and more intimate, more and more understanding."" ""It will give consumers more support and help them interact with the future AI world,"" he added.

Zhao pointed out that many generative AI applications, such as from OpenAI's ChatGPT, require large amounts of computing power well beyond the battery capability of a single smartphone. That means they need to use the cloud, which raises questions about the security of data transfer. Balancing AI capabilities with energy usage and data privacy is a ""huge challenge"" for manufacturers, Zhao said. He said a system collecting lots of user data to deliver more personalized features becomes a ""stronger"" object compared to the individual using the system. ""In the future development of smartphones, our goal is that the individual becomes stronger,"" Zhao said. ""When an object becomes stronger, this will reveal the smallness of the individual in its presence. I believe mobile end devices need to empower and enable individuals.""

The U.S. is the only G20 economy to see growth above pre-pandemic levels, and ""robust"" growth indicates ongoing upside risks to inflation, the 190-country agency said.

""We do recognize important upside risks,"" IMF Managing Director Kristalina Georgieva said at a press briefing on Thursday. ""Given those risks, we agree that the Fed should keep policy rates at current levels until at least late 2024."" The Fed's current fed funds rate has stood within the range of 5.25% to 5.50% since July 2023.

The IMF, often called the world's ""lender of last resort,"" forecasts that the core personal consumption expenditures price index — the Fed's preferred measure of inflation — will end 2024 at around 2.5% and reach the Fed's 2% target rate by mid-2025, ahead of the Fed's own projection for 2026.

U.S. economic strength during the Fed's rate-hike cycle was aided by labor supply and productivity gains, Georgieva said, while highlighting the need for ""clear evidence"" that inflation is coming down to the 2% target before the Fed cuts rates.

Nonetheless, the IMF's ""more optimistic"" assessment of the downward inflation trajectory is based on indications of a cooling labor market in the U.S. and weakening consumer demand.

""I want to recognize that a lesson we learned from the last [few] years is we are at a time of more uncertainty. This uncertainty also lies ahead. We are confident, however, that the Fed will move through that, and certainly with the same prudence it has demonstrated over the last year,"" Georgieva said.

Roaring Kitty, whose legal name is Keith Gill, has stirred up trading in speculative names such as GameStop by posting cryptic images and memes online. A picture of a cartoon dog appeared on his X feed Thursday afternoon, briefly driving up Chewy shares as much as 34% to $39.10. The stock later fell into negative territory again in Thursday's session, closing the day down 0.3%.

Chewy shares rallied dramatically on Thursday after meme stock leader Roaring Kitty posted a picture on social media platform X that resembles the logo of the online pet food retailer, but the gains were quickly erased later in the session.

There's also a strong connection between meme stock GameStop and Chewy. GameStop CEO Ryan Cohen was the founder and CEO of Chewy, who was instrumental in PetSmart's takeover of Chewy in 2017 and its subsequent initial public offering in 2019.

Cohen joined the GameStop board of directors along with two other Chewy executives in January 2021, partly helping fuel the initial GameStop rally. He later took over as GameStop CEO in 2023, leading a turnaround in the brick-and-mortar video game retailer.

Shares in pet retailers such as Chewy and Petco saw big spikes during the pandemic when stuck-at-home consumers adopted cats and dogs in droves. With the adoptions came purchases of needed accessories such as new beds and leashes for their furry family members.

But as the pandemic ended and people began venturing outside again, adoption numbers slowed and consumers had less need for discretionary pet items such as toys and cages, which carry higher profit margins than pet food.

Over the past year or so, Chewy and Petco have seen consistently strong pet food sales, but revenue for higher margin categories has fallen.

Gill is a former marketer for Massachusetts Mutual Life Insurance. He came into the limelight after successfully encouraging retail investors to buy GameStop shares and call options in 2021 to squeeze out short-selling hedge funds. The mania in 2021 led to a series of congressional hearings featuring Gill in brokers' practices and the ""gamification"" of retail trading.","A picture of a cartoon dog appeared on his X feed Thursday afternoon, briefly driving up Chewy shares as much as 34% to $39.10.

CNBC,https://www.cnbc.com/2024/06/27/jpmorgan-chase-fed-stress-test-results-error.html,2024-06-27,14:34:23 UTC,JPMorgan Chase says its stress test losses should be higher than what the Fed disclosed,"JPMorgan Chase CEO and Chairman Jamie Dimon gestures as he speaks during the U.S. Senate Banking, Housing and Urban Affairs Committee oversight hearing on Wall Street firms, on Capitol Hill in Washington, D.C.

JPMorgan Chase said late Wednesday that the Federal Reserve overestimated a key measure of income in the giant bank's recent stress test, and that its losses under the exam should actually be higher than what the regulator found.

The bank took the unusual step of issuing a press release minutes before midnight ET to disclose its response to the Fed's findings.

JPMorgan said that the Fed's projections for a measure called ""other comprehensive income"" — which represents revenues, expenses and losses that are excluded from net income — ""appears to be too large.""

Under the Fed's table of projected revenue, income and losses though 2026, JPMorgan was assigned $13 billion in OCI, more than any of the 31 lenders in this year's test. It also estimated that the bank would face roughly $107 billion in loan, investment and trading losses in that scenario.

""Should the Firm's analysis be correct, the resulting stress losses would be modestly higher than those disclosed by the Federal Reserve,"" the bank said.

The error means that JPMorgan might require more time to finalize its share repurchase plan, according to a person with knowledge of the situation who declined to be identified speaking about the regulatory process. Banks were expected to begin disclosing those plans on Friday after the market closes.

The news is a wrinkle to the Federal Reserve's announcement Wednesday that all 31 of the banks in the annual exercise cleared the hurdle of being able to withstand a severe hypothetical recession, while maintaining adequate capital levels and the ability to lend to consumers and corporations.

Last year, Bank of America and Citigroup made similar disclosures, saying that estimates of their own future income differed from the Fed's results.

Banks have complained that aspects of the annual exam are opaque and that it's difficult to understand how the Fed produces some of its results.","The bank took the unusual step of issuing a press release minutes before midnight ET to disclose its response to the Fed's findings.

CNBC,https://www.cnbc.com/2024/06/26/fed-banks-stress-test-2024.html,2024-06-26,21:26:37 UTC,Federal Reserve says all 31 banks in annual stress test withstood a severe hypothetical downturn,"Federal Reserve Board Vice Chair for Supervision Michael Barr testifies before a House Financial Services Committee hearing on the response to the bank failures of Silicon Valley Bank and Signature Bank, on Capitol Hill in Washington, D.C., on March 29, 2023.

The Federal Reserve said Wednesday that the biggest banks operating in the U.S. would be able to withstand a severe recession scenario while maintaining their ability to lend to consumers and corporations.

Each of the 31 banks in this year's regulatory exercise cleared the hurdle of being able to absorb losses while maintaining more than the minimum required capital levels, the Fed said in a statement.

The stress test assumed that unemployment surges to 10%, commercial real estate values plunge 40% and housing prices fall 36%.

""This year's results show that under our stress scenario, large banks would take nearly $685 billion in total hypothetical losses, yet still have considerably more capital than their minimum common equity requirements,"" said Michael Barr, the Fed's vice chair for supervision. ""This is good news and underscores the usefulness of the extra capital that banks have built in recent years.""

The Fed's stress test is an annual ritual that forces banks to maintain adequate cushions for bad loans and dictates the size of share repurchases and dividends. This year's version included giants such as JPMorgan Chase and Goldman Sachs , credit card companies including American Express and regional lenders such as Truist .

While no bank appeared to get badly tripped up by this year's exercise, which had roughly the same assumptions as the 2023 test, the group's aggregate capital levels fell 2.8 percentage points, which was worse than last year's decline.

That is because the industry is holding more consumer credit card loans and more corporate bonds that have been downgraded. Lending margins have also been squeezed compared to last year, according to the Fed.

""While banks are well-positioned to withstand the specific hypothetical recession we tested them against, the stress test also confirmed that there are some areas to watch,"" Barr said. ""The financial system and its risks are always evolving, and we learned in the Great Recession the cost of failing to acknowledge shifting risks.""

The Fed also performed what it called an ""exploratory analysis"" of funding stresses and a trading meltdown that applied to only the eight biggest banks.

In this exercise, the companies appeared to avoid disaster, despite a sudden surge in the cost of deposits combined with a recession. In a scenario where five large hedge funds implode, the big banks would lose between $70 billion and $85 billion.

""The results demonstrated that these banks have material exposure to hedge funds but that they can withstand different types of trading book shocks,"" the Fed said.

Morgan Stanley is pushing further into its adoption of artificial intelligence with a new assistant that is expected to take over thousands of hours of labor for the bank's financial advisors. The assistant, called Debrief, keeps detailed logs of advisors' meetings and automatically creates draft emails and summaries of the discussions, bank executives told CNBC. Morgan Stanley plans to release the program to the firm's roughly 15,000 advisors by early July, marking one of the most significant steps yet for the use of generative AI at a major Wall Street bank. While the company's earlier efforts involved creating a ChatGPT-like service to help advisors navigate the firm's reams of research, Debrief brings AI into direct contact with advisors' most prized resource: their relationships with rich clients. The program, built using OpenAI's GPT-4, essentially sits in on client Zoom meetings, replacing the note-taking that advisors or junior employees have been doing by hand, according to Jeff McMillan, Morgan Stanley's head of firmwide artificial intelligence. ""What we're finding is that the quality and depth of the notes are just significantly better,"" McMillan told CNBC. ""The truth is, this does a better job of taking notes than the average human.""

Consent required

Importantly, clients must consent to being recorded each time Debrief is used. Future versions will allow advisors to use the program on corporate devices during in-person meetings, said McMillan. The rollout will serve as a real-world test for the vaunted productivity gains of generative AI, which took Wall Street by storm in recent months and has bolstered the value of chipmakers, tech giants and the broader U.S. stock market. Morgan Stanley's wealth management division hosts about 1 million Zoom calls a year, the bank told CNBC. While estimates vary, one Morgan Stanley advisor involved in the Debrief pilot said the program saves 30 minutes of work per meeting; advisors typically spend time after meetings creating notes and action plans to address client needs.

""As a financial adviser I'm doing four, five or six meetings a day,"" said Don Whitehead, a Houston-based advisor who's been testing the software. By ""having the note-taking service built in through AI, you can really be invested in the meeting, you're actually a lot more present."" It remains to be seen what advisors will do with the hours reclaimed from essential grunt work. In a sense, Morgan Stanley's projects in generative AI amount to a ""grand experiment in productivity,"" said McMillan. If, as McMillan and others believe, advisors will spend more time serving clients and prospecting for new ones, the technology should boost Morgan Stanley's growth in assets under management, as well as retention of clients and advisors. Morgan Stanley's wealth management division is one of the world's largest with $5.5 trillion in client assets as of March; the firm wants to reach $10 trillion. It will take at least a year to determine whether the technology is boosting advisor productivity, McMillan said. ""I'm the analytics guy, but the advisors will tell you that they're at their best when they're engaging"" with clients, said McMillan. ""None of them will tell you they love taking notes or looking at research reports, right? That's not why they got into this business.""

""I believe the governments [of China and the European Union] are now considering how, through negotiations, they can combine investment together with commodity trade,"" said Wan Gang, now president of the China Association for Science and Technology.

Wan was speaking via an official English translation during a livestream of a panel at the World Economic Forum's ""Summer Davos"" meeting in Dalian, China. Spokespersons for the European Commission were not immediately available when contacted by CNBC.

Regarding specifics, China's Ministry of Foreign Affairs referred CNBC to the Chinese authorities ""in charge,"" according to a CNBC translation of the Chinese. The ministry said China and the EU are each other's most important trade and investment partners, and that China hoped the EU would keep its trade and investment markets open.

China's Ministry of Commerce did not immediately respond to a request for comment outside of business hours on Thursday. The Commerce Ministry's spokesperson told reporters earlier in the day that the Chinese and European working groups remain in close consultations.

The Commerce Ministry had said over the weekend that it was launching consultations with the EU over the bloc's probe into the role of subsidies in Chinese electric cars. The EU said earlier this month that it would increase tariffs on imports of the vehicles.

""Even though we are not exporting a large number of EVs, perhaps the Chinese companies can try investing in Europe,"" Wan said, noting that such funding could create local jobs.","HEFEI, China — The man who spearheaded China's electric car strategy said Wednesday that Chinese investment in the European electric vehicles industry could be a way forward for both sides amid trade tensions.

CNBC,https://www.cnbc.com/2024/06/26/your-401k-is-up-but-a-new-report-says-americans-need-to-save-more-.html,2024-06-26,11:00:06 UTC,"Your 401(k) is up, and a new report shows increased savings. But Americans need to do more","How's your 401(k) looking? A new report shows Americans are saving more, but probably need to do even more.

Vanguard has released its annual report, How America Saves 2024. Vanguard and Fidelity are the two biggest sponsors of 401(k) plans, and this is a snapshot of what nearly five million participants are doing with their money.

The good news: stock market returns are up and, thanks largely to automatic enrollment plans, investors are saving more than they did in the past.

The bad news: account balances for the median 401(k) of a person approaching retirement (65+) remains very low.

The takeaway: Americans are still very reliant on Social Security for a large chunk of their retirement.

Higher returns, participation rates, savings rates

Why do we care so much about 401(k) plans? Because it's the main private savings vehicle Americans have for retirement. More than 100 million Americans are covered by these ""defined contribution"" plans, with more than $10 trillion in assets.

First, 2023 was a good year to be an investor. The average total return rate for participants was 18.1%, the best year since 2019.

But to be effective vehicles for retirement, these plans need to: 1) have high participation rates, and 2) hold high levels of savings.

On those fronts, there is good news. John James, managing director of Vanguard's Institutional Investor Group, called it ""a year of progress.""

Plan participation reached all-time highs. Thanks to a change in the law several years ago, a record-high 59% of plans offered automatic enrollment in 401(k) plans. This is a major improvement: ipreviously, enrollment in 401(k) plans were often short of expectations because investors had to ""opt-in,"" that is they had to choose to participate in the plan. Because of indecision or simple ignorance, many did not. By switching to automatic enrollment, participants were automatically enrolled and had to ""opt-out"" if they did not want to participate.

The result: enrollment rates have gone up. Plans with automatic enrollment had a 94% participation rate, compared with 67% for voluntary enrollment plans.

Participant saving rates reached all time highs. The average participant deferred 7.4% of their savings. Including employee and employer contributions, the average total participant contribution rate was 11.7%.

A few other observations about Vanguard's 401(k) plan investors:

They prefer equities and target date funds. They love equities over bonds or any other investments. The average plan contribution to equities is 74%. A record-high 64% of all 2023 contributions went into target-date funds, which automatically adjust stock and bond allocations as the participant ages.

They don't trade much. In 2023, only 5% of nonadvised participants traded within their accounts; 95% did no trading at all. ""Over the past 15 years, we have generally observed a decline in participant trading,"" Vanguard said, which it partially attributed to increased adoption of target-date funds.

Despite gains in the market, account balances are still low

In 2023, the average account balance for Vanguard participants was $134,128, but the median balance (half had more, half had less) was only $35,286.

Why such a big difference between the average and the median? Because a small group of investors with large balances pull up the averages. Forty percent of participants had less than $20,000 in their retirement accounts.

Median balances for those near retirement are still low

A different way to look at the problem is to ask how much people who are retirement age have saved, because it's an indication of how prepared they are for imminent retirement.

Investors 65 years or older had an average account balance of $272,588, but a median balance of only $88,488.

A median balance of $88,488 is not much when you consider older participants have higher incomes and higher savings rates. That is not much money for a 65-year old nearing retirement.

Of course, these balances don't necessarily reflect total lifetime savings. Some have more than one retirement plan because they had other plans with previous employers. Most do have other sources of retirement savings, typically Social Security. A shrinking number may also have a pension. Some may have money in checking accounts, or have stocks or bonds outside a retirement account.

Regardless, the math does not look great

So let's do some retirement math.

A typical annual drawdown for a 401(k) account in retirement is about 4%. Drawing down 4% of $88,488 a year gets you $3,539 every 12 months.

Next, Social Security. As of January 2023, the average Social Security benefit was almost $1,689 per month, or about $20,268 per year.

Finally, even though pensions are a vanishing benefit, let's include them.

According to the Pension Rights Center, the median annual pension benefit for a private pension is $9,262 (government employees have higher benefits).

Here's our yearly retirement budget:

Personal savings $3,539

Pension $9,262

Social Security $20,264

Total: $33,065

It's certainly possibly to live on $33,000 a year, but this would likely only work if you own your home, have low expenses and live in a low-cost part of the country.

Even then, it would hardly be a robust retirement.

And these are the lucky ones. Only 57% of retirees have a tax-deferred retirement account like a 401(k) or IRA. Only 56% reported receiving income from a pension.

And that extra income largely determines whether a retiree feels good or bad about their retirement.

In 2023, four out five retirees said they were doing at least okay financially, but this varied tremendously depending on whether retirees had sources of income outside of Social Security. Only 52% of retirees who did not have private income said they were doing at least okay financially.

What can be done?

To have a more robust retirement, Americans are just going to have to save more.

One issue is investors still don't contribute the maximum amount allowed. Only 14% of participants saved the statutory maximum amount of $22,500 per year ($30,000 for those age 50 or older). The likely reason: most felt they couldn't afford to.

However, only 53% of even those with income over $150,000 contributed the maximum allowed. Given that the employee match is ""free money,"" one would think participants in that income bracket would rationally choose to max out their contribution. The fact that many still don't suggests that more investor education is needed.

Regardless, it's very dangerous to assume that retirees are going to be bailed out by an ever-rising stock market. Another year anywhere near 2022, when the S&P 500 was down 20%, and investor confidence in their financial future will likely deteriorate.","The bad news: account balances for the median 401(k) of a person approaching retirement (65+) remains very low.

AMSTERDAM — Europe is at risk of falling behind the U.S. and China on artificial intelligence as it focuses on regulating the technology, according to Prince Constantijn of the Netherlands. ""Our ambition seems to be limited to being good regulators,"" Constantijn told CNBC in an interview on the sidelines of the Money 20/20 fintech conference in Amsterdam earlier this month. Prince Constantijn is the third and youngest son of former Dutch Queen Beatrix and the younger brother of reigning Dutch King Willem-Alexander. He is special envoy of the Dutch startup accelerator Techleap, where he works to help local startups grow fast internationally by improving their access to capital, market, talent, and technologies. ""We've seen this in the data space [with GDPR], we've seen this now in the platform space, and now with the AI space,"" Constantijn added. European Union regulators have taken a tough approach to artificial intelligence, with formal regulations limiting how developers and companies can apply the technology in certain scenarios.

The bloc gave final approval to the EU AI Act, a ground-breaking AI law, last month. Officials are concerned by how quickly the technology is advancing and risks it poses around jobs displacement, privacy, and algorithmic bias. The law takes a risk-based approach to artificial intelligence, meaning that different applications of the tech are treated differently depending on their risk level. For generative AI applications, the EU AI Act sets out clear transparency requirements and copyright rules. All generative AI systems would have to make it possible to prevent illegal output, to disclose if content is produced by AI and to publish summaries of the copyrighted data used for training purposes. But the EU's Ai Act requires even stricter scrutiny for high-impact, general-purpose AI models that could pose ""systemic risk,"" such as OpenAI's GPT-4 — including thorough evaluations and compulsory reporting of any ""serious incidents."" Prince Constantijn said he's ""really concerned"" that the Europe's focus has been more on regulating AI than trying to become a leader innovating in the space. ""It's good to have guardrails. We want to bring clarity to the market, predictability and all that,"" he told CNBC earlier this month on the sidelines of Money 20/20. ""But it's very hard to do that in such a fast-moving space."" ""There are big risks in getting it wrong, and like we've seen in genetically modified organisms, it hasn't stopped the development. It just stopped Europe developing it, and now we are consumers of the product, rather than producers able to influence the market as it develops."" Between 1994 and 2004, the EU had imposed an effective moratorium on new approvals of genetically modified crops over perceived health risks associated with them.

The bloc subsequently developed strict rules for GMOs, citing a need to protect citizens' health and the environment. The U.S. National Academies of Sciences says that genetically modified crops are safe for both human consumption and the environment. Constantijn added that Europe is making it ""quite hard"" for itself to innovate in AI due to ""big restrictions on data,"" particularly when it comes to sectors like health and medical science. In addition, the U.S. market is ""a much bigger and unified market"" with more free-flowing capital, Constantijn said. On these points he added, ""Europe scores quite poorly."" ""Where we score well is, I think, on talent,"" he said. ""We score well on technology itself."" Plus, when it comes to developing applications that use AI, ""Europe is definitely going to be competitive,"" Constantijn noted. He nevertheless added that ""the underlying data infrastructure and IT infrastructure is something we'll keep depending on large platforms to provide.""","Prince Constantijn is special envoy to Techleap, a Dutch startup accelerator.

DALIAN, China — For China's yuan to be used more globally, the currency needs more ""applications"" such as for stocks and bonds, Bonnie Chan, CEO of Hong Kong Exchanges and Clearing Limited, said on a panel Tuesday. Beijing has long touted its ambitions for increasing global use of the Chinese yuan — also known as the ""renminbi"" or ""RMB"" — in an international financial market where the U.S. dollar is the dominant currency. U.S. sanctions on Russia have also increased the pressure on some countries to have alternatives to the greenback. Chan, speaking during the World Economic Forum's ""Summer Davos"" meeting in Dalian, China, noted that people hold a currency for trade, or, more importantly, as a store of wealth. ""We're not just going to hold on to a bunch of RMB and put it into this bank account,"" she said. ""You want to have bonds, you want to have equities, etc."" ""One of our strategic imperatives [has] been changed to make sure that we continue to produce more RMB-denominated security products,"" Chan said, ""so that investors around the world can actually see more applications of the RMB and be able to use those as the medium to store wealth in the form of the RMB.""

Last year, the HKEX announced a ""Dual-Counter"" program that allows investors to trade Hong Kong-listed securities in Hong Kong dollars or Chinese yuan. In a significant step toward internationalization of the yuan, the International Monetary Fund in 2015 announced that it would add the yuan to its basket of reserve currencies the following year. The yuan was the fourth-most active currency for global payments by value in May, accounting for nearly 4.5% of such transactions, according to the interbank messaging network SWIFT. The U.S. dollar had a nearly 48% share. In trade finance, the yuan ranked third at about 5.1% in May, according to SWIFT. The euro was slightly higher at 5.6%, while the U.S. dollar dominated with a nearly 85% share, the data showed. Fred Hu, founder, chairman and CEO of Primavera Capital, said on the same panel Tuesday that the internationalization of the yuan is probably going to take longer than many expect, despite an increased amount of statements from Beijing. While China is the largest trading nation and has large financial centers, ""we're not as big, as deep as the U.S.,"" Hu said. ""Besides our capital account is also closed, it's not fully convertible, [which] also in some way [is] hampering the internationalization of the renminbi.""

A maturing financial market

Developing more Chinese yuan-denominated investment products also requires a maturation of the local financial sector. Part of that includes having a more sophisticated investor base. Chan said that during the annual Lujiazui Financial Forum in Shanghai last week, nearly every conversation with top leaders included the term ""patient investing."" The phrase has emerged in official releases to encourage long-term investing over short-term speculation. ""Patience comes from learning through the market volatility,"" Kenny Lam, CEO of Two Sigma Asia-Pacific, said during the same panel on Tuesday. He said that policymakers have been giving more thought to making their policies more stable and consistent.

Why life insurance purchases have 'steadily' fallen

Many Americans fail to plan for their mortality, neglecting to draft wills, put a power of attorney in place or designate beneficiaries for financial accounts. Overall, the share of households with life insurance has ""steadily"" decreased since the early 1970s, according to the ACLI. There are likely many reasons for that drop-off.

watch now

For one, younger generations are deferring big financial and life milestones such as getting married, buying a home and having kids relative to older generations. Each of these events generally acts as a key trigger to buy life insurance, experts said. Higher-costing homeownership and child care, coupled with rising debt burdens (for student loans, for example), may mean younger households are less willing or able to pay monthly insurance premiums, said Knoll, a senior financial planner at The Planning Center. Insurance costs themselves are also generally rising for consumers, Shapiro said. Additionally, life insurance is often not typically easy or quick to buy due to factors such as medical testing for underwriting, Shapiro said. ""It's a complex transaction,"" he said.

There are more benign factors at play, too: For instance, fewer consumers have sought out the tax benefits of certain life policies as other tax-advantaged savings options, such as 401(k) accounts and 529 plans, have come into existence, Knoll said. That said, even as fewer people buy life insurance, ""I do think there's a need for it,"" he added. Life insurance isn't necessarily right for everyone, though. Here are some key considerations.

When to buy life insurance

Consumers should consider their financial situation and the standard of living they want to maintain for survivors, such as dependents or spouses, according to the Illinois Department of Insurance. Absent a policyholder's income, there might be a financial shortfall in paying day-to-day household expenses, or for debts and big-ticket items such as tuition, for example. ""Who will be responsible for your funeral costs and final medical bills? Would your family have to relocate? Will there be adequate funds for future or ongoing expenses such as daycare, mortgage payments, or college?"" the department said in a consumer guide. Single people without kids may also have financial obligations, such as funeral expenses, medical bills, debts like credit cards or student loans, and financial support for elderly parents, the IDOI said.

What type of life insurance to buy

There are two broad types of life insurance: term and permanent. Term insurance will typically be best for most consumers, according to financial advisors. These policies last for a designated term, perhaps 10, 20 or 30 years. They generally carry fixed monthly premiums. The length of one's financial obligation is a good guide to the term one should choose, Shapiro said.

It's absolutely clear to me there's a very large gap here. Scott Shapiro U.S. insurance sector leader at KPMG

If a policyholder's spouse is 35 years old and the policyholder seeks a financial hedge until their spouse retires — perhaps at age 65 — the buyer might choose a term of 30 years, for example. Ensuring there's enough money for young kids to go to college might mean having a policy that lasts about 20 years. Permanent life insurance, such as a whole or universal life policy, is meant to last throughout life. It may make sense for consumers to pay for a lifelong policy if they want to leave a financial legacy for charities, or reasonably expect to develop a medical condition that can make it harder to get insurance later. Permanent insurance is generally more costly and complex than a term policy, advisors said. For example, it often carries an interest-bearing account in addition to the insurance component. Policyholders can build up cash value over time depending on factors such as dividends or investment returns. The cash value can have various uses: to pay insurance premiums, as collateral for a loan, or as cash in the event a buyer surrenders their policy in the future. However, there's a lot of fine print and consumers should avoid buying something they don't understand, advisors said.

Chinese EV-makers have ramped up their global expansion in the last year as domestic competition intensified.

However, trade tensions have escalated, with the U.S. and likely the European Union, increasing tariffs on imports of Chinese electric cars.

That doesn't necessarily restrict their growth. Chinese automakers, such as BYD, are investing in local factories.

Cisco, which provides networking equipment and software for businesses, is working with at least 10 electric car customers as they build factories, offices and research and development centers overseas, according to Wong.

""At least as of now, we don't hear anything from the [EV] customers saying that, 'Oh, because of this, we need to stop investing, or we need to slow down,'"" he added.

DETROIT — Purchasing a vehicle has never been that easy. But shoppers entering traditional dealer showrooms for the foreseeable future may have a new challenge: An alphabet soup of ""electrified"" vehicle offerings. As all-electric vehicle adoption crawls along in the U.S., automakers are increasingly releasing various hybrid vehicles as alternative options to EVs and traditional gas-powered engines. A variety of models means more customer choice, but also more complexity for automakers and consumers, many of whom are returning to the new vehicle market for the first time in years following unprecedented supply chain shortages and record used vehicle prices. ""More choice in the marketplace is good for consumers, but only if they understand the differences,"" said Paul Waatti, director of industry analysis at AutoPacific. ""There needs to be more clarity on what the terms and acronyms actually mean, and what the potential benefits and drawbacks are."" A car shopper today has their pick of traditional internal combustion engine (ICE) vehicles; mild-hybrid electric vehicles (MHEVs); hybrid electric vehicles (HEVs); plug-in hybrid electric vehicles (PHEVs); fuel cell electric vehicles (FCEVs) and battery-electric vehicles (BEVs), also commonly known as EVs. Also coming later this year from Stellantis : range-extended electric vehicles (REEVs) that are similar to plug-in hybrid vehicles but can exclusively function as an EV, with its electric motors powered by a gas engine. Each type of vehicle may be better for a different kind of customer. All except EVs and fuel-cell vehicles continue to offer a traditional internal combustion engine combined with ""electrified"" technologies such as a battery or motor to assist in performance or fuel economy. Heather Seymour, of St. Johns, Florida, said she did quite a bit of research prior to purchasing a 2022 Jeep Wrangler Rubicon plug-in hybrid electric vehicle, known as a 4xe model. ""I knew I wanted to kind of dip my toe in the water of the hybrids. I wasn't ready to go full electric, so the plug-in was definitely of interest to me,"" said Seymour, who said she typically uses the all-electric range of the SUV, except on longer trips. ""The more we learned about it, the more we figured out what we wanted.""

EV naming

While consumers may not need to know every acronym or technology to find their right model, automakers aren't exactly helping the situation with their consumer-facing naming. For example, Hyundai's Genesis brand calls its all-electric vehicles ""electrified,"" while many others reserve that term for hybrids. Chrysler's Pacifica minivan is a plug-in hybrid labeled as a regular ""hybrid,"" and Toyota markets some of its traditional hybrids as ""hybrid EVs."" Stellantis says its REEV vehicles are not PHEVs, despite operating similarly. ""Every automaker is using different terms. There's no standardization, and that causes some confusion on the consumer side,"" Waatti said.

Some automakers such as General Motors also use traditional nameplates such as the Chevrolet Blazer and Equinox for new EVs that share little to nothing with their gas-powered counterparts other than the name. Stellantis' Jeep also uses the ""Wagoneer"" moniker for two large gas-powered SUVs as well as a smaller, all-electric Wagoneer ""S"" SUV. Jeep CEO Antonio Filosa has said he isn't worried about any confusion, as the brand has a strong naming heritage and customers can decide which vehicle is best for their needs. ""I believe that we need education, but after education we have a lot of choices for the consumer,"" he said during a recent interview. ""It's all for the benefit of the consumer. They will have a lot of flexibility.""

Education is key

One thing automotive executives from Japan and South Korea to Detroit and Germany can agree on is the need for consumer education. Whether vehicles are electrified or all-electric, they're critical for automakers to meet tightening emissions and fuel economy targets as well as to build production scale, reduce prices and increase profits.

Kia and its dealers have put out myth-busting pages online to answer concerns or frequently asked questions about EVs and hybrids. They range from technical questions about batteries to practical questions like whether you can go through a car wash in an EV (you can). GM has taken it a step further. The Detroit automaker launched ""EV Live"" in 2022. It's an online video platform, now known as ""GM Energy Live,"" that allows participants to interact one-on-one with EV specialists and learn about electric vehicles and charging. Ford Motor recently launched its own video-based training program, geared toward its more than 3,000 U.S. franchised dealers to improve customer service, better engage employees and provide dealers and the company with more data to help in selling the vehicles. Auto executives say it's up to the companies as well as their dealers to be trained and educated about the benefits of the vehicles, whatever they may be. ""Each customer, in the end, is very different,"" said Jérémie Papin, chair of Nissan Americas, earlier this year. ""I think it's what the vehicle can do for them,"" not necessarily how the technology works, he said.

Automotive alphabet soup The automotive industry has more powertrain and ""propulsion"" options than ever before. Here's a breakdown: Internal combustion engine (ICE): A ""traditional"" vehicle with an engine that's fueled with gasoline or diesel.

Plug-in hybrid electric vehicle (PHEV) : These vehicles feature an internal combustion engine combined with a hybrid system, including a larger battery than traditional hybrid vehicles as well as a plug to recharge the vehicle's battery. They typically allow drivers to travel a certain number of miles using the battery before the engine is needed to power the car or truck.

Range-extended electric vehicles (REEV): These are an emerging technology that largely function as a PHEV, however after the battery runs out of energy to power the vehicle, an engine works as a generator to exclusively power electric motors. The vehicle still drives like an EV instead of having the engine directly power the vehicle's motion.

That's according to the hundreds of items on display at the Summer Fancy Food Show, a trade show hosted by the Specialty Food Association that has gained a reputation as a place to spot the next big flavors, foods and drinks that will dominate menus and grocery store shelves. The annual show returned to the Jacob K. Javits Convention Center in New York this week, running Sunday through Tuesday. More than 2,400 companies exhibited their foods and drinks for attendees, which include restaurant operators, specialty food retailers and trendspotters. Past show trends that are making their way to mainstream consumers' palettes include yuzu, mushrooms and sophisticated alcohol substitutes. Previous shows have also been a springboard for small brands seeking a wider audience. Honest Tea, Ben & Jerry's and Tate's Bake Shop are among the companies that attended the show in their early days on their way to becoming well-known consumer brands now owned by the industry's biggest players. Here are some highlights from this year's Summer Fancy Food Show:

Honey — as a flavor

Humans have been eating honey for thousands of years, but it's taking center stage as a flavor with some food and beverage makers. In the SFA's preliminary report on the show, its trendspotters called out honey, noting its health benefits. Honey was the star in both foods and drinks across the show. Green Bee showed off its honey soda, which includes a Honeycomb Cider flavor. Owl Creek Organics & Natural Flavors displayed honey spreads, with flavors ranging from caffe mocha to lemon poppyseed. And Dutch company Klepper & Klepper used honey as a flavor for their licorice.

Tinned fish

Krill Arctic Foods' tinned krill meat Amelia Lucas | CNBC

In years past, tinned fish was relegated primarily to booths in the Spanish and Portuguese pavilions. But this year, exhibitors showed off their tinned fish products across the show floor. TikTok helped fuel the tinned fish trend last year, boosting sales of canned sardines. Now specialty food companies are responding. This isn't the canned tuna of yore. There are more flavors, different seafood varieties and trendier packaging. Wildfish Cannery, an Alaska-based company that was founded in 1987, showed off a new retro design for its sockeye salmon, giving it a more upscale feel. Krill Arctic Foods exhibited its canned krill meat, which may lack the same curb appeal on its packaging but boasts about the food's nutritional profile.

Fish to go

Exhibitors also showed off new ways to eat fish on the go, hoping to capitalize on consumers' desire for convenience and more protein in their diets. The association named ""satisfying snacks"" as one of the trends that it's been watching. Acme Smoked Fish highlighted its new Lox in a Box snack kits, available with cream cheese or avocado. Legend of Master International, an Asian food supplier, sampled its Kani fish cake sticks, made to eat like string cheese or for cooking.

Upgraded charcuterie

Fossil Farms' array of salami flavors, including lamb and bison Amelia Lucas | CNBC

Like tinned fish, the popularity of charcuterie boards owes a lot to social media, where users can dazzle their followers with elaborate displays of preserved meats, cheeses and fruit. Companies at the Summer Fancy Food Show showed off some new options to level up the charcuterie — especially the salami. Tempesta Artisan Salumi offered up black truffle-flavored salami, while Salt & Twine's selection included a mezcal and salted lime flavor. But exhibitors weren't just having fun with the flavors. Some are looking beyond pork to make the cured meat. Driftless Provisions' salami uses elk, venison and bison alongside pork. Fossil Farms' salami lineup included lamb and wagyu beef.

Pfizer had a ""phenomenal"" first quarter — and Wall Street took notice, CEO Albert Bourla told thousands of employees during a companywide town hall on May 2, according to a recording heard by CNBC. A day earlier, the pharmaceutical giant's stock had closed 6% higher after its quarterly results topped analyst estimates and it hiked its full-year outlook. It was a far cry from the year prior, when Pfizer's shares plunged more than 40%, making it one of the worst-performing large pharmaceutical stocks of 2023. Its market cap of about $157 billion is now less than half of its 2021 peak of nearly $350 billion. Few companies benefited from the pandemic as much as Pfizer did. The drugmaker's profits boomed, fueled by its Covid vaccine and antiviral pill Paxlovid. After Pfizer and German company BioNTech rapidly developed and deployed a lifesaving shot that helped the world emerge from the pandemic, Pfizer drew widespread praise. Pfizer's success contributed to its equally jarring fall from grace. When the virus receded in 2023, its Covid products revenue plummeted. The world, which hailed Pfizer as a pandemic hero a few years earlier, no longer needed the company in the same way. Pfizer may be on its way toward stabilizing its business and winning back Wall Street's favor after the strong first quarter. But the company is struggling to balance that with the fears of its employees, some of whom said they feel uncertain about their future and unmotivated after the sudden reversal of fortune. In October Pfizer launched a multibillion-dollar cost-cutting program, slashing research and development spending and laying off hundreds of employees — including in the once-lauded Covid vaccine unit. In May the company said it's on track to deliver $4 billion in savings by the end of the year.

Stock Chart Icon Stock chart icon Pfizer's stock surged after it rolled out its Covid vaccine and antiviral treatment, then plunged when the company's Covid revenue started to drop.

Now, as Pfizer appears poised to turn a corner, the company is trying to boost employee morale to match Wall Street's optimism. CNBC spoke with 11 current and former Pfizer employees — all of whom asked to remain anonymous for fear of retaliation — about Pfizer's dizzying climb, rapid decline and turnaround strategy. The company's seesawing fortunes have fueled uncertainty within Pfizer's workforce. Most of the current and former employees CNBC spoke with called Pfizer a good place to work, and some current employees said they feel optimistic about the direction of the company after the first quarter. But other current employees are dissatisfied with where the strategy shift has left them. Some cited higher workloads after teams were stretched thin by budget cuts, a return-to-office policy they said has forced out some remote workers, and doubts about how the business will perform moving forward. The company's separate multiyear cost-cutting program announced in May is also stoking fears about the potential for new U.S. layoffs, according to some current workers. Some employees working in certain manufacturing and supply chain divisions, which they believe are likely to be affected by the cuts, described having low morale and motivation to work. Meanwhile, several former Pfizer employees, most of whom were laid off over the last six months or left voluntarily, said they're unhappy with how the company handled cost cuts in 2023. Some alleged that Pfizer management provided little transparency around the layoffs and seemed more focused on the company's stock performance than its staff throughout the process. During the latest town hall, Bourla told employees that layoffs in the U.S. have been completed but that more are occurring internationally. He called the job cuts ""very, very painful"" and said it was ""killing"" him to let employees go. But he also acknowledged that Wall Street likes the cuts. ""And, of course, I'm very concerned with everyone that could be affected and impacted by that, but it works,"" Bourla said, according to the recording. ""And we saw it, how the Street will respond."" A Pfizer spokesperson said reducing costs will ""put us on strong footing towards margin expansion and improved financial returns moving forward."" The spokesperson added that cutting expenses is one of Pfizer's five priorities for the year, along with maximizing the performance of new products, innovating its drug pipeline, growing its oncology business with its acquisition of cancer drugmaker Seagen, and allocating capital to increase its dividend, reduce outstanding debt and reinvest in the business. To cut costs, apart from layoffs the company is trimming its drug portfolio and direct marketing spending, shrinking its real estate footprint and reducing its investment in Covid, among other efforts, said the spokesperson. The spokesperson said Pfizer does not take the layoffs ""lightly"" and that the company is ""focused on providing our impacted colleagues with the resources and compassion they deserve.""

What went wrong in 2023

Pfizer entered 2023 on a high. The company had just capped a record-breaking 2022 with $100 billion in sales, more than half of which came from its Covid vaccines and Paxlovid. Employee morale at Pfizer was relatively high at the time, some current and former workers told CNBC. The company had gone on a hiring spree and piled money into different projects, they said. The success came with trade-offs. Two former employees involved in developing the Covid vaccine manufacturing process said they were experiencing burnout at the start of 2023. In January 2023, Pfizer forecast a steep drop in annual revenue, to between $67 billion and $71 billion. That outlook included $13.5 billion and $8 billion in sales of Covid vaccines and Paxlovid, respectively. But it could not predict at the time just how much revenue would dry up.

During an earnings call that same month, Pfizer executives said they expected roughly 24% of the U.S. population to get an annual Covid booster in 2023. But by December, only around 17% of U.S. adults had received the new Covid shots from Pfizer and Moderna, according to data from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Many Americans who got previous Covid shots felt they did not need more protection because the threat of the virus had diminished, according to recent surveys. Meanwhile, use of Paxlovid in the U.S. was dented by reductions in Covid testing and infection rates, and by doctors' concerns about interactions with common medications, among other factors. As demand plummeted, the federal government returned millions of the antiviral treatment courses to Pfizer. In January this year, however, Pfizer said fewer courses were returned by the end of 2023 than it had expected. The company soon acknowledged the challenges its Covid business faced towards the end of 2023. In October, Pfizer said it slashed both ends of its 2023 sales guidance by around $9 billion ""solely due to its Covid products."" At the same time, Pfizer started to cut costs. The company still hasn't said how many employees it laid off, though it reduced staff around the world. Pfizer's 2023 revenue ultimately came in at $58.5 billion, including $11.22 billion from its Covid vaccine and $1.28 billion from Paxlovid. The end of the year brought other challenges for Pfizer: The company scrapped the twice-daily version of its experimental weight loss drug, danuglipron, and saw slower uptake for a newly launched RSV vaccine in the U.S. than competitor GSK saw with its own version. After the string of difficulties, investors showed relief when Pfizer announced the cost cuts. But for many employees, the shift in post-pandemic strategy was a nightmare, they told CNBC. During a conference in January, Bourla acknowledged that 2023 was a rough year for the company and its stock price. But he said Pfizer took steps to start 2024 with a ""clean slate."" Those included renegotiating multibillion-dollar Covid contracts with the EU and other governments, transitioning its Covid products to the commercial market in several countries and writing off unused stock of its vaccine and Paxlovid. ""So it's not simple, how many people will use the vaccine. There were a lot of things we had to remove"" he said. Bourla also touted Pfizer's portfolio of new products that it said will boost sales, including nine new product approvals in the U.S. last year and a pipeline of drugs that could bring in more future revenue. Pfizer has also repeatedly said that the Seagen deal brings a proven antibody-drug conjugate platform that enhances its commercial structure and could help the company become a ""world-class oncology leader."" Pfizer has said Seagen could contribute more than $10 billion in risk-adjusted sales by 2030 with its targeted cancer therapies. Those revenue streams would help Pfizer prepare for upcoming patent expirations for blockbuster drugs, including its breast cancer treatment Ibrance, and Eliquis, a blood thinner it shares with Bristol Myers Squibb .

A 'slap in the face'

Some current and former employees said they knew early in 2023 that wide-scale layoffs were possible. Those people alleged that Pfizer has long had a culture of hiring too many people and later laying many employees off — a cycle seen at many other large companies. Pfizer wasn't the only Covid-boom company whose business declined. Biotech company Moderna 's revenue from its Covid shot also plunged in 2023. Companies outside the pharmaceutical industry that flourished in 2020, including fitness firm Peloton and digital meeting platform Zoom , also struggled to adjust as people returned to their pre-pandemic lives. Other drugmakers big and small are still downsizing and restructuring their workforces. Big pharmaceutical companies, such as Bristol Myers Squibb, are trying to conserve cash as they could lose revenue from upcoming drug patent expirations and Medicare drug price negotiations, among other threats. Biotech companies are also working to stay afloat after a rough 2023 marked by rising interest rates, a poor deal market and a lack of fundraising. At Pfizer, there were other warnings of trouble ahead, according to current and former employees: a small round of layoffs during the first quarter of 2023 and budget restrictions that limited travel, team lunch outings and purchases of new lab and manufacturing equipment. Pfizer's announcement in March 2023 that it would acquire Seagen for a whopping $43 billion was another sign, according to some current and former employees. While most of the 11 workers acknowledged that the deal made sense for Pfizer's growth, they said the hefty price tag at a time when Covid sales had already started to decline left them uneasy. Still, a few former employees said they felt blindsided by the company's decision to let go of staff, saying they were relatively optimistic about the business before the October cost-cut announcement. One former employee who worked at a site focused on gene therapies in Durham, North Carolina, said they were repeatedly told their job would be safe — even as Pfizer divested much of its early stage portfolio for those treatments at the start of 2023. The company confirmed with news outlets in October that it would close that site and lay off an undisclosed number of staff. Notably, Pfizer's layoffs also affected some workers involved in the research, development and manufacturing of the company's Covid vaccine, according to some current and former employees. They said those workers, whom Pfizer celebrated as pandemic heroes just a year earlier, felt especially betrayed by the cuts. ""It felt like we were tossed out the door when they no longer needed us,"" said one former employee who worked on the vaccine.

All the current and former employees who spoke with CNBC said they believed the company handled the layoffs and the months leading up to them poorly. Some workers said they were disappointed with what they called higher management's lack of transparency around the layoffs. Some also questioned why Pfizer did not set more realistic expectations for its Covid business earlier, especially as cases and public concern about the virus diminished in the U.S. On Oct. 17, just a few days after Pfizer publicly announced its cost-cutting program to investors, executives held a companywide town hall with Pfizer's more than 80,000-person workforce that one worker described as ""disastrous"" and another called a ""slap in the face."" On the town hall, Bourla and Pfizer Chief Human Experience Officer Payal Sahni Becher acknowledged the company's Covid business was struggling but said it was positioning for growth with the cost cuts, according to some current and former employees. Those people said the executives addressed the looming layoffs during the town hall but provided scant details on how many workers, teams or sites they would affect, when they would occur or how the company decided who would lose their jobs. Many workers also alleged that Bourla and Becher were too casual during the town hall, cracking light jokes and chuckling at some of the questions asked by staff, such as one about employee bonuses.

Return-to-office policies

On top of layoffs, return-to-office policies launched in 2023 forced out some workers in fully remote roles, some current and former employees said. Those people said some fully remote employees had their virtual work status revoked and were asked to start working in person at their site starting on a certain date under the new mandates. While some workers were asked to come in only two or three days a week, even that was impossible for staff members who lived too far from their sites, according to the employees. Some remote workers who did not comply over time were let go, the current and former employees said. A Pfizer spokesperson did not confirm or provide any details about its recent return-to-office policies. ""The return to office has been possibly the worst managed factor in all of this,"" one current employee said.

Those policies also applied to workers who were relocated from recently closed facilities, according to some employees. For example, Pfizer in October said it would shut down its office in Peapack, New Jersey in 2024, which affected nearly 800 workers. The company first announced those plans in 2021. Pfizer told news outlets that the majority of employees would be relocated to its headquarters in New York City. For one employee, a 15-minute commute to work became closer to an hour-and-a-half trip. During another town hall, on Oct. 26, Pfizer Chief Global Supply Officer Mike McDermott said the decision to close the Peapack site ""wasn't made lightly."" But he said having Peapack employees work in person at the company's headquarters was ""right for Pfizer's culture,"" according to a recording heard by CNBC. He said the company isn't taking away remote work as an option. Pfizer leadership has been vocal about asking employees to work in person again. ""Teleconferencing is simply no substitute for the personal interaction that makes it possible to share ideas, build connection, or even agree to disagree,"" Bourla said during the APEC CEO Summit in November. Pfizer is just one of several companies across different industries to push for in-person work again after the pandemic. Tech giants such as Google similarly reversed course on remote work in 2023 after offering flexibility to employees throughout Covid, reportedly frustrating workers.

Employee morale

Employee morale plummeted in the months after the October layoff announcement, according to current and former employees. Some of those people said they were unmotivated to work with their job security in question, while one worker described ""walking on eggshells"" for weeks out of fear that they would lose their job. Other employees said they were stretched thin due to understaffing and a lack of other resources. A few workers said they struggled to keep up with abrupt internal changes, such as being assigned to new managers or being moved onto different teams. Some current employees said Pfizer has held several so-called transparency meetings, which allow workers to anonymously ask questions and provide feedback to senior leadership. Faith in executive leadership also plunged among some workers, according to most of the current and former employees who spoke with CNBC. Some employees acknowledged that executives have a duty to care about their company's stock price but said that Bourla and other officials appeared to be hyper-focused on Pfizer shares even as people lost their jobs. Some current workers said that hasn't appeared to change after the town hall on May 2. Others said Bourla's remarks were encouraging and sounded far more genuine.

NASA and Boeing are further extending the first Starliner crewed flight but are not yet setting a new target date for returning the capsule to Earth, the organizations announced Friday.

Boeing's Starliner capsule ""Calypso"" will stay at the International Space Station into next month while the company and NASA conduct new testing back on the ground. Boeing's crew flight test represents the first time Starliner is carrying people, flying NASA astronauts Butch Wilmore and Suni Williams.

Officials say the Starliner team is starting a test campaign of the spacecraft's thruster technology at White Sands, New Mexico — testing that will be completed before Starliner returns to Earth.

""We think the testing could take a couple of weeks. We're trying to replicate the inflight conditions as best we can on the ground,"" NASA's Commercial Crew manager Steve Stich said during a press conference.

Before launching on June 5, Boeing and NASA planned for Starliner to be in space for nine days. As of Friday, the Starliner flight has tallied 24 days and counting.

Despite the extended stay at the ISS, officials emphasized that Starliner is safe to return at any point in case of an emergency. NASA and Boeing say the delay for testing is solely to gather more data about the spacecraft's performance, in particular its thruster system.

""I want to make it very clear that Butch and Suni are not stranded in space,"" Stich said.

The Starliner crew flight test represents a final major step before NASA certifies Boeing to fly crew on operational, six-month missions. Yet, similar to the previous two spaceflights that were uncrewed, Starliner is running into several problems during the mission.","Boeing's crew flight test represents the first time Starliner is carrying people, flying NASA astronauts Butch Wilmore and Suni Williams.

CNBC,https://www.cnbc.com/2024/06/28/ford-ceo-30000-ev-coming-in-two-and-a-half-years-at-a-profit.html,2024-06-28,21:30:54 UTC,"Ford CEO says a profitable $30,000 EV is coming in two and a half years","An electric Ford truck is displayed during the Electrify Expo D.C. in Washington, D.C., on July 23, 2023.

Ford Motor expects to introduce a $30,000 all-electric vehicle that will be profitable in roughly two and a half years, CEO Jim Farley said Friday during the Aspen Ideas Festival.

Farley did not release many other details about the vehicle, which is being developed by a Ford ""skunkworks"" team, but said its main competitors are expected to be Chinese automakers such as BYD and an anticipated entry-level car from U.S. EV leader Tesla .

Farley said Ford is first focusing on smaller EVs instead of larger all-electric trucks and SUVs, which have historically been gas-powered profit engines for the company, because such vehicles are ""never going to make money.""

""You have to make a radical change as an [automaker] to get to a profitable EV. The first thing we have to do is really put all of our capital toward smaller, more affordable EVs,"" Farley said during an interview with CNBC's Julia Boorstin. ""That's the duty cycle that we've now found that really matches. These big, huge, enormous EVs, they're never going to make money. The battery is $50,000. … The batteries will never be affordable.""

A Ford spokesman later clarified Farley was referring to large vehicles such as the company's Super Duty models or vehicles that require massive battery packs to achieve significant EV ranges of 500 miles. He was not referring to ones such as Ford's current all-electric F-150 Lightning pickup or next-generation EVs.

Ford earlier this year said it was postponing production of a large three-row SUV at a plant in Canada to 2027 from its initial plan of 2025. It also postponed a next-generation pickup, codenamed ""T3,"" from late 2025 to 2026.

Farley on Friday reiterated Ford's next-generation vehicles would be profitable.

He also said Americans need to ""get back in love"" with small cars instead of larger ones, a surprising statement given a majority or Ford's profits come from trucks and considering American carmakers have historically had trouble making money on small models.

""We have to start to get back in love with smaller vehicles. It's super important for our society and for EV adoption,"" Farley said Friday. ""We are just in love with these monster vehicles, and I love them too, but it's a major issue with weight.""

Ford's EV unit lost $1.32 billion during the first quarter of this year on 10,000 vehicles wholesaled. While the unit also includes EV-related business such as software, those losses equate to a loss of $132,000 per vehicle the unit sells.

Farley said it is crucial for Ford to make profitable EVs in the next five years as Chinese automakers continue to expand globally.

""If we cannot make money on EVs, we have competitors who have the largest market in the world, who already dominate globally, already setting up their supply chain around the world,"" he said. ""And if we don't make profitable EVs in the next five years, what is the future? We will just shrink into North America.""","Ford Motor expects to introduce a $30,000 all-electric vehicle that will be profitable in roughly two and a half years, CEO Jim Farley said Friday during the Aspen Ideas Festival.

CNBC,https://www.cnbc.com/2024/06/28/tractor-supply-ends-dei-pride-support-carbon-goals.html,2024-06-28,15:22:47 UTC,"Rural retailer Tractor Supply eliminates DEI roles, Pride support and carbon emissions goals","Shoppers are seen at the parking lot of a Tractor Supply Co. store near Bloomsburg.

Tractor Supply, a retail chain that sells home improvement equipment, livestock and agricultural supplies for farmers and pet owners, is eliminating diversity, equity and inclusion roles; withdrawing carbon emission goals; and walking back support for the LGBTQ community as part of sweeping changes to environmental, social and governance initiatives, the company announced this week.

The retailer said in a Thursday release that it will no longer submit data to the Human Rights Campaign, an LGBTQ advocacy group. The company will also stop sponsoring Pride festivals and voting campaigns, the release said. The company previously earned a perfect score on the Human Rights Campaign Foundation's 2022 Best Places to Work Corporate Equality Index.

The announcement comes in the final days of Pride Month.

Tractor Supply is also retiring initiatives aimed at reducing environmental impact and improving employee diversity. The company had set goals to achieve net zero carbon emissions in operations by 2040 and to reduce its water usage by 2025. Its DEI targets included boosting the number of employees of color at the manager level and above by 50% by 2026.

Tractor Supply said it's making the changes to better represent the values of the communities and customers it serves. The retailer caters to largely rural communities, with 50,000 employees across 2,250 stores in 49 states, according to company data.

""Rural communities are the backbone of our nation and what make America great,"" Tractor Supply said in the news release. ""We have heard from customers that we have disappointed them. We have taken this feedback to heart.""

Tractor Supply said it has invested millions of dollars in veteran causes, state fairs, animal shelters, rodeos and farmers markets and that it invests in the future of rural America by being the largest supporter of FFA, a nonprofit that promotes agricultural education for middle and high schoolers.

The retailer was previously included on Newsweek's list of America's Greatest Workplaces for Diversity in 2023 and was named to Bloomberg's Gender Equality Index for 2022 and 2023.

The publicly traded company has a market valuation of about $29 billion. CNBC contacted Tractor Supply for more details about the changes, and the company declined to comment beyond the release.

The changes come amid a growing wave of anti-DEI sentiment in the wake of a U.S. Supreme Court decision in 2023 to strike down affirmative action in colleges. Experts at the time predicted the ruling could have implications for corporate hiring or recruiting.

Companies, including Starbucks , Disney and Target , have faced legal challenges over DEI initiatives for LGBTQ customers and employees. In February 2023, pharmaceutical giant Pfizer dropped race-based eligibility requirements for a fellowship program designed for college students of Black, Latino and Native American descent, the Associated Press reported.","Shoppers are seen at the parking lot of a Tractor Supply Co. store near Bloomsburg.

CNBC,https://www.cnbc.com/2024/06/27/nike-nke-earnings-q4-2024.html,2024-06-28,15:11:44 UTC,"Nike shares plunge after retailer says quarterly sales will fall 10%, warns on China weakness","Nike shoes and logo are seen at a store in Nice, France on May 28, 2024.

Shares of Nike plunged on Friday after the retailer cut its full-year guidance and said it expects sales to drop 10% during its current quarter as it warned of soft sales in China and ""uneven"" consumer trends across the globe.

The expected 10% first-quarter slump is far below the 3.2% drop that analysts had expected, according to LSEG.

Nike shares plunged nearly 20% in trading Friday.

The sneaker giant, which reported quarterly earnings Thursday, now expects fiscal 2025 sales to be down mid-single digits, compared to analyst estimates of a 0.9% increase. Nike previously expected sales to grow. The company also expects sales in the first half to be down in the high single digits, compared to previous guidance of declines in the low single digits.

""A comeback at this scale takes time,"" the retailer's finance chief Matthew Friend said on a call with analysts Thursday. ""Although the next few quarters will be challenging, we are confident that we are repositioning Nike to be more competitive with a more balanced portfolio to drive sustainable, profitable, long-term growth.""

The company cut its guidance as it contends with slower online sales, planned declines in classic footwear franchises, ""increased macro uncertainty"" in the Greater China region and ""uneven consumer trends"" across Nike's markets, Friend said. It also expects sales into wholesalers to be slower as it scales new innovations and pulls back on classic franchises.

For the fiscal fourth quarter, the company handily beat earnings estimates as its cost-cutting efforts continue to bear fruit, but Nike fell short on revenue.

Here's how Nike did during the period compared with what Wall Street was anticipating, based on a survey of analysts by LSEG:

Earnings per share: $1.01 adjusted vs. 83 cents expected

$1.01 adjusted vs. 83 cents expected Revenue: $12.61 billion vs. $12.84 billion expected

The company's reported net income for the three-month period that ended May 31 was $1.5 billion, or 99 cents per share, compared with $1.03 billion, or 66 cents per share, a year earlier.

Sales dropped to $12.61 billion, down about 2% from $12.83 billion a year earlier.

In fiscal 2024, Nike posted sales of $51.36 billion, which is flat compared to the prior year. It's the slowest pace of annual sales growth the company has seen since 2010, excluding the Covid-19 pandemic.

Nike executives attributed the sales miss to a range of factors. They said its lifestyle business declined during the quarter and that momentum in its performance business, such as its basketball and running shoes, wasn't enough to offset it.

Online performance was soft because Nike had a higher share of lifestyle products, more promotions and fewer sales of classic franchises, such as its Air Force 1. It also saw traffic in China decline across all channels beginning in April due to macro conditions in the region.

Despite the traffic decline in China, sales in the region exceeded Wall Street expectations, according to StreetAccount, coming in at $1.86 billion, compared with estimates of $1.79 billion. It was the only geographical segment to top estimates for the period.

Sales in North America, its largest market, came in at $5.28 billion, below StreetAccount expectations of $5.45 billion.

In Europe, Middle East and Africa, Nike posted revenue of $3.29 billion, compared to estimates of $3.32 billion. In Asia Pacific and Latin America, Nike saw $1.71 billion in sales, compared to estimates of $1.77 billion.

Still, Friend later warned of the ""softer outlook"" in China and said had it not been for Chinese marketplace Tmall's early start to the region's 618 shopping holiday, sales in the country would've fallen short of Nike's internal expectations.

""The China marketplace remains highly promotional, and we continue to manage both Nike and partners' inventory carefully,"" said Friend. ""While our outlook for the near term has softened, we remain confident in Nike's competitive position in China in the long term.""

Nike's Converse brand was once again a significant underperformer in the overall results. The division saw revenue plunge 18% to $480 million, largely due to declines in North America and Western Europe.","Nike previously expected sales to grow.

CNBC,https://www.cnbc.com/2024/06/27/how-walmarts-sams-club-is-trying-to-take-on-costcos-kirkland.html,2024-06-27,12:10:56 UTC,How Walmart-owned Sam's Club is trying to take on Costco's private label Kirkland,"Stuck at home during the Covid pandemic, Megan Crozier needed a way to keep her two young children entertained. She bought an inflatable pool from Sam's Club.

The pool began leaking air after just a few uses.

For Crozier, chief merchant of the Walmart -owned membership club, that trashed pool — and the disappointment that came with it — helped kickstart a years-long effort to catch up with chief rival Costco and the popularity of its private brand, Kirkland Signature.

As Sam's Club opens more locations, it is trying to raise the bar for its own brand, Member's Mark. The label's makeover has become critical for Sam's Club as it aims to close the gap with Costco, which has roughly the same number of U.S. clubs but about twice as much annual revenue. Net sales for Sam's Club totaled $86.2 billion in its most recent fiscal year, compared with $176.63 billion for Costco's U.S. clubs.

Sam's Club CEO Chris Nicholas told CNBC the brand's revamp was inspired, in part, by the retailer's chief rival.

""The club model survives because you have brilliant merchants focusing on creating or buying exceptional items,"" he said in an interview. ""Costco did such a great job of that over the years with Kirkland and we saw that be successful.""

The success of Member's Mark will help determine how Sam's Club fares as its expands, with plans to open more than 30 stores over the next four years. At least some stores will be in regions where potential customers belong to a competing club like Costco or B.J.'s Wholesale , or in areas where customers may need convincing to pay an annual membership to be able to shop.

Overtaking Costco and its beloved private label won't be easy for Sam's Club, said Michael Baker, a retail analyst for D.A. Davidson.

""Never say never,"" he said. ""Who knows? But I think it's going to take a long time.""

But he added Costco's success with Kirkland Signature created a formula that Sam's Club can follow.

The popularity of Kirkland's brand, which includes a diverse range of items like vodka, batteries and dress shirts, has helped to drive membership sign-ups and renewals. It is one of the features that Costco highlights when the retailer's pitch to members.","As Sam's Club opens more locations, it is trying to raise the bar for its own brand, Member's Mark.

CNBC,https://www.cnbc.com/2024/06/27/goodrx-tracker-drug-prices-rise.html,2024-06-27,22:10:55 UTC,"Drug prices have risen almost 40% over the past decade, according to a new tracker","The cost of prescription medications in the U.S. has increased 37% since 2014, far surpassing the rate of inflation, according to data from drug savings company GoodRx .

Though the price increases have slowed this year in comparison to the past decade, the higher costs are raising out-of-pocket expenses for consumers. The average American spends $16.26 out of pocket per prescription, according to the data.

""When things increase … inevitably, they do trickle down to consumers, especially those who are in a high deductible plan or who don't have insurance or find themselves paying substantially out of pocket,"" said GoodRx director of research Tori Marsh.

GoodRx said the patients' share of the cost continues to grow due to rising copays, coinsurances and deductibles. The company found that over the past 10 years, the average person's deductible nearly doubled, and copays are rising as the majority of plans are adding another tier of drugs with higher copays.

It is a dynamic GoodRx deems ""the big pinch."" High medication costs are coupled with reduced insurance coverage. Analyzing coverage for more than 3,700 Medicare Part D plans between 2010 and 2024, GoodRx found that the portion of medications covered dropped 19% during that period.

""The impact is really kind of threefold,"" Marsh said. ""Rising costs or rising prices are a big part of it, but it's really that with the combination of increased friction. … It's hard for people to, in some ways, access their medication or access a pharmacy. And then on top of that, insurance is not what it used to be. It's not covering as much as it used to.""

On average, Americans pay two to three times more for prescription drugs than consumers in other developed countries, according to the White House.

Drug costs have become a focus for President Joe Biden, particularly as he approaches the 2024 election. The Biden administration has taken several measures to lower out-of-pocket drug expenses.

On Wednesday, the White House announced it would lower prices on 64 prescription drugs for some Medicare beneficiaries as a result of inflation penalties on drugmakers.

The lower costs, effective during the third quarter, will benefit roughly 750,000 people who use the drugs annually, some of whom could save up to $4,593 per day, according to the release.

""Despite efforts by policymakers and industry leaders to break down affordability and accessibility barriers, a patient's actual out-of-pocket cost continues to increase and is often a huge surprise to them,"" said GoodRx interim CEO Scott Wagner in a news release.

Tesla is losing its lead over legacy automakers in the quality of its new all-electric vehicles, according to an annual influential study conducted by J.D. Power.

The 2024 U.S. Initial Quality Study found the quality of Tesla's battery-electric vehicles, or BEVs, and those of traditional carmakers were the same, at 266 problems reported per 100 newly sold or leased vehicles.

Previously, Tesla models had outperformed the electric vehicles of legacy automakers in the annual survey. Last year, the Tesla received a rank of 257 problems per 100 vehicles, compared with 265 problems per 100 vehicles on average for EVs from traditional automakers.

The study attributes Tesla's growing problems to a negative response from customers after the company removed traditional feature controls, such as turn signals and wiper stalks.

Across the broader industry, not just BEVs, Tesla has consistently ranked toward the bottom in initial quality since J.D. Power began including Tesla in the study in 2022.

Overall, the study, which included repair visits data of franchised dealers for the first time, found electric vehicles such as BEVs and plug-in hybrid electric vehicles (PHEVs), are plagued with more problems than traditional gas- and diesel-powered vehicles with internal combustion engines.

""Owners of cutting edge, tech-filled BEVs and PHEVs are experiencing problems that are of a severity level high enough for them to take their new vehicle into the dealership at a rate three times higher than that of gas-powered vehicle owners,"" J.D. Power's senior director of auto benchmarking, Frank Hanley, said in a news release.

The study found that plug-in vehicles require more repairs than gas-powered vehicles across all repair categories.

BEVs averaged 266 problems per 100 vehicles, 86 points higher than gas- and diesel-powered vehicles, which averaged 180 problems per 100 vehicles, according to the study. A lower score indicates higher vehicle quality.

Top concerns included features, controls and displays as well as wireless smartphone integration, as customers reported frequent difficulties with Apple CarPlay and Android Auto.

The study also reported frustration over false warnings, unnecessary traffic alerts and automatic braking features. Specifically, rear seat reminders contribute 1.7 problems per 100 vehicles across the industry, as owners report receiving signals even when no one is in the rear seat.

""It is not surprising that the introduction of new technology has challenged manufacturers to maintain vehicle quality,"" Hanley said.

2025 Rivian R1S Rivian

A Thursday investor event for Rivian Automotive that focused on cost-cutting efforts, efficiency gains and in-house technologies and software wasn't enough to build on the company's significant share growth this week. Shares of the all-electric vehicle startup fell by about 2% to 6% for much of the event, eating into some of its 23% gain in shares the day before on news of an up to $5 billion investment by Volkswagen Group . Rivian's stock closed Thursday down 1.8% to $14.47 per share, off by roughly 39% year to date amid investor concerns regarding cash burn and a slowdown in EV sales. Rivian on Thursday reconfirmed its 2024 guidance that included production of 57,000 vehicles and a path to positive gross profit during the fourth quarter, including regulatory credits. It also outlined longer-term growths, such as plans to achieve positive adjusted earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization in 2027. ""Everything that you're hearing from us, around our product, around how we're running the business, around how we're driving toward profitability, my hope is that you're seeing really an extreme sense of urgency,"" Rivian CEO RJ Scaringe said during the event. ""We're very, very fast driving towards the improvements necessary to get to positive free cash flow and, before that, positive margins this year.""

Rivian also outlined long-term financial targets of a roughly 25% gross margin, 10% free cash flow and adjusted profit margin in the ""high teens."" The company did not release a time frame for these targets. Scaringe spent much of his time during the roughly four-hour presentation discussing efficiencies in products and manufacturing, which he said are expected to lead to 20% material cost reductions in its current vehicles, followed by 45% targeted reductions in its upcoming ""R2"" vehicles, which are projected to begin production in early 2026. The reductions range from physical savings, such as a 54% decrease in design costs of its R2 vehicles compared with current models, to lower costs on more complex systems such as battery packs and electrical hardware. For example, the company is using 10 fewer in-house electronic control units, or ECUs, in its recently redesigned R1 vehicles, allowing it to remove 1.6 miles in wiring harness length and 44 pounds out of the vehicle. Rivian's software expertise is at the center of VW's plans to invest $5 billion in the automaker by 2026, including an anticipated joint venture between the companies to create electrical architecture and software technology. Volkswagen is expected to use Rivian's electrical architecture and software stack for vehicles beginning in the second half of the decade, Scaringe said during the investment announcement. He said the joint venture does not include anything with battery technologies, vehicle propulsion platforms, high voltage systems or autonomy and electrical hardware.

The retail pharmacy giant now expects fiscal 2024 adjusted earnings of $2.80 to $2.95 per share. That compares with the company's previous outlook of between $3.20 and $3.35 per share.

""'We assumed ... in the second half that the consumer would get somewhat stronger"" but ""that is not the case,"" Walgreens CEO Tim Wentworth told CNBC.

He added that ""the consumer is absolutely stunned by the absolute prices of things, and the fact that some of them may not be inflating doesn't actually change their resistance to the current pricing. So we've had to get really keen, particularly in discretionary things.""

Still, Walgreens topped revenue estimates for the quarter on strong performance in its health-care segment. The company views that business division as critical to its ongoing push to transform from a major drugstore chain into a large health-care company.

The results come as Walgreens works to slash costs after a rocky last year marked by low pharmacy reimbursement rates, weakening demand for Covid products and a challenging macroeconomic environment.

The company on Friday said it is simplifying its U.S. health-care portfolio and finalizing plans to close underperforming U.S. stores over multiple years, among other ongoing cost-cutting efforts.

""Seventy-five percent of our stores drive 100% of our profitability today,"" Wentworth said. ""What that means is the others we take a hard look at, we are going to finalize a number that we will close.""

Here's what Walgreens reported for the three-month period ended May 31 compared with what Wall Street was expecting, based on a survey of analysts by LSEG:

Earnings per share: 63 cents adjusted vs. 68 cents expected

63 cents adjusted vs. 68 cents expected Revenue: $36.4 billion vs. $35.94 billion expected

Walgreens booked sales of $36.4 billion for the quarter, up 2.6% from the same period a year ago.

The company reported net income of $344 million, or 40 cents per share, for the quarter. That compares with net income of $118 million, or 14 cents per share, for the same period a year ago.

Excluding certain items, adjusted earnings were 63 cents per share for the quarter.

Walgreens did not provide a new revenue forecast for the fiscal year. The company has not offered that guidance since October, when it said it expected $141 billion to $145 billion in sales.","Shares of Walgreens closed more than 20% lower on Thursday after the company reported fiscal third-quarter earnings that fell short of expectations and slashed its full-year adjusted profit outlook, citing a ""challenging"" environment for pharmacies and U.S. consumers.

Vcg | Visual China Group | Getty Images

Chinese automakers are expected to continue rapidly expanding outside of their home country to achieve 33% of the global automotive market share by 2030, according to a new report released Thursday by prominent consulting firm AlixPartners. Much of the growth, from a forecast 21% market share this year, is expected to come outside of China. Sales outside of China are expected to grow from 3 million this year to 9 million by 2030, representing growth from 3% to 13% of market share by the end of this decade. The rapid expansion of Chinese automakers is a growing concern for legacy automakers and politicians globally. Many fear that the less-expensive, China-made vehicles will flood the markets, undercutting domestic-produced models, especially all-electric vehicles.

AlixPartners said it expects the Chinese brands to grow across all markets globally. However, the firm added that it expects far smaller expansion in Japan and North America, including the U.S., where vehicle safety standards are more stringent and a 100% tariff on imported Chinese EVs has been announced. ""China is the industry's new disruptor – capable of creating must-have vehicles that are faster to market, cheaper to buy, advanced on tech and design, and more efficient to build,"" Mark Wakefield, global co-leader of the automotive and industrial practice at AlixPartners, said in a statement. In North America, Chinese automakers are forecast to only achieve a 3% market share, largely in Mexico, where one in five vehicles are expected to be Chinese brands by 2030. In most other major regions of the world, AlixPartners reports that the share of Chinese automakers is expected to exponentially grow. Those areas include Central and South America, Southeast Asia and the Middle East and Africa. Chinese brands in China also are expected to grow from 59% to 72% in market share, according to AlixPartners. Legacy automakers such as General Motors have lost significant ground in China in recent years amid the rapid rise of China's domestic automotive industry and companies such as BYD , Geely and Nio .

Several new reports show the price gains are shrinking and home sellers are starting to give in after a stagnant spring market.

For the first time since the start of the Covid-19 pandemic, when home sales ground to a halt, the typical house sold for slightly less than its asking price — 0.3% lower — during the four weeks ended June 23, according to real estate brokerage Redfin. A year ago at that time the typical home was selling at list price. Two years ago it was selling at about 2% above list price.

That's not to say that the housing market is crashing. A little less than two-thirds of homes still sold over asking price in the last month; that is, however, the lowest share since June 2020. While most sellers are still listing their homes at higher prices than comparable homes sold for a year ago, some are conceding that they simply can't command those prices.","Some of the heat is coming out of home prices, even though they're still higher than they were a year ago.

Maxar Technologies | Via Reuters

NASA will have a spacecraft from Elon Musk's SpaceX guide the International Space Station's destruction later this decade, the agency announced Wednesday. The National Aeronautics and Space Administration awarded an $843 million contract to SpaceX to build the so-called ""U.S. Deorbit Vehicle."" The spacecraft will be designed to guide the football-field-sized research laboratory back into the Earth's atmosphere after retiring in 2030. The SpaceX-built vehicle will effectively destroy the ISS by pushing the station into reentry from orbit. ""It is crucial to prepare for the safe and responsible deorbit of the International Space Station in a controlled manner,"" NASA said in a press release, with the U.S. Deorbit Vehicle needed to ""ensure avoidance of risk to populated areas.""

NASA did not specify whether SpaceX's design for the U.S. Deorbit Vehicle will be based on one of the company's existing spacecraft, such as its Dragon capsules. SpaceX and NASA did not immediately respond to CNBC's request for comment on the design. Sign up here to receive weekly editions of CNBC's Investing in Space newsletter. The U.S. – along with four international partner agencies representing Russia, Europe, Canada, and Japan – has been preparing for the eventual end of the ISS, which has been crewed since 2000. The ISS, primarily created as a crewed research laboratory, has seen more than 3,300 experiments conducted in microgravity. That includes research not possible on Earth such as medical sciences and technology demonstrations.

Aging ISS

But the ISS is aging, with NASA and its lead partner Roscosmos, unable to solve a worsening problem of microscopic leaks on the station. NASA published a study on Wednesday with analysis of why it decided to intentionally destroy the ISS in a controlled reentry. The agency evaluated a variety of alternatives, including disassembling the station in orbit or trying to raise the ISS to a higher orbit with a large spacecraft like SpaceX's Starship. ""The space station is a unique artifact whose historical value cannot be overstated. NASA considered this when determining if any part of the station could be salvaged for historical preservation or technical analysis,"" the agency wrote. Ultimately, the agency study determined that any attempts to preserve or reuse the ISS were technically or economically infeasible. NASA noted the possibility the ISS' operational lifetime could be extended beyond 2030, but that is yet to be determined and requires agreement with its international partner agencies. NASA is planning to replace the ISS through private space stations and is helping fund U.S. companies' development through the Commercial LEO Destinations (CLD) program. The ISS totaled about $150 billion to develop and build and costs NASA about $4 billion each year to operate, so the agency sees privately built space stations as a way to replace the ISS at a fraction of the cost.","A satellite image shows an overview of the International Space Station with the Boeing Starliner spacecraft, June 7, 2024.

CNBC,https://www.cnbc.com/2024/06/26/levi-levi-earnings-q2-2024.html,2024-06-27,09:17:32 UTC,Levi's shares drop 15% as jeans maker's sales disappoint despite denim craze,"Denim is having a moment with consumers, but it hasn't led to a major sales boost at Levi Strauss .

The jeans creator on Wednesday posted fiscal second-quarter revenue that fell just short of Wall Street's expectations at a time when shoppers are stocking their wardrobes with denim dresses, skirts and ultra low-rise baggy pants.

Levi's posted better-than-expected earnings as its direct sales to consumers and cost cutting continue to bear fruit. The company raised its dividend by 8% to 13 cents per share, its first increase in six quarters.

Still, shares fell about 15% in extended trading.

Here's how Levi's performed during the quarter compared with what Wall Street was anticipating, based on a survey of analysts by LSEG:

Earnings per share: 16 cents adjusted vs. 11 cents expected

16 cents adjusted vs. 11 cents expected Revenue: $1.44 billion vs. $1.45 billion expected

The company's reported net income for the three-month period that ended May 26 was $18 million, or 4 cents per share, compared with a loss of $1.6 million, or zero cents a share, a year earlier. Excluding one-time items, Levi's posted earnings of $66 million, or 16 cents per share.

Sales rose to $1.44 billion, up about 8% from $1.34 billion a year earlier. However, the sales jump was coming off of an easier comparison.

In the year-ago period, sales were down 9% after Levi's shifted its wholesale shipments from its fiscal second quarter into its fiscal first quarter. The shift reduced sales last year by about $100 million, the company said previously. Excluding the shift, as well as the exit of Levi's Denizen business, sales would have been up by only about 1% in its most recent quarter compared to the year-ago period.

Finance chief Harmit Singh attributed the sales miss to unfavorable foreign exchange conditions and weak sales at Docker's. During the quarter, the khaki and chinos brand saw $82.4 million in sales, up 8.6% from $75.8 million in the year ago period. It's not clear how sales at Docker's were affected by the timing of Levi's wholesale orders.

""People are generally cautious,"" Singh told CNBC in an interview. ""It's not necessarily an environment where people are buying a lot, people are cautious.""

While Levi's posted a strong earnings beat, it only reaffirmed its full-year guidance, which was in line with estimates. The company continues to expect full-year earnings per share to be between $1.17 and $1.27, which now includes a 5-cent hit coming from the company's new distribution and logistics strategy.

Levi's said it is transitioning from a primarily owned-and-operated distribution and logistics network in the U.S. and Europe to one that relies more on third parties.

""In the near term, these changes require the parallel operation of new and old facilities for the rest of 2024, resulting in a transitory increase in distribution costs,"" the company said.

The change allows Levi's to shift the responsibility of final mile delivery to third parties. The denim maker noted that it has new terms with its supplier that result in Levi's taking ownership of inventory closer to the point of shipment rather than its eventual destination. Levi's distribution network was built for a business that primarily sold to wholesalers, and now it needs to change into one that's more focused on selling directly to consumers.

The changes are necessary because nearly half of Levi's sales these days are coming from its own website and stores.

Direct-to-consumer sales jumped 8% during the quarter, representing 47% of overall sales. Online sales increased 19%.

""Our transformational pivot to operating as a DTC-first company is yielding positive results around the world, giving me great confidence that we will achieve accelerated, profitable growth for the rest of the year and beyond,"" CEO Michelle Gass said in a statement.

During the quarter, wholesale revenue grew 7%, but excluding the shift in timing of wholesale orders, sales in the channel decreased 4%. Singh noted that wholesale revenue improved on a sequential basis, but the company has a ""conservative"" view of the channel's growth moving forward.

By building out its own direct channels, Levi's enjoys higher profits, better data on its consumers and less reliance on shaky wholesalers like Macy's and Kohl's, which are continuing to shrink and fall out of favor with consumers.

However, selling directly can also be more expensive, and can come with unexpected hiccups that can impact sales and drain profits. For example, when someone buys a pair of Levi's from Macy's and wants to return them, Macy's typically bears that cost. Under a direct model, that responsibility, including the cost and logistics, would fall on Levi's.

Nike has come to be known as a cautionary tale for retailers long reliant on wholesalers that try to expand direct sales.

For a while, Nike's focus on direct sales boosted revenue and profits, but some critics said the strategy shift led to a slowdown in innovation, and ultimately, market share losses.

Recently, the company acknowledged that it erred when it cut off so many of its wholesale partners and said it has since ""corrected"" that.

It's been almost 20 years since the founding of Alphabet's YouTube, and Hollywood still doesn't really know what to do with it. YouTube, which effectively invented user-generated content, claims a daunting share of overall media consumption. And it's no longer just dominating the internet, it's dominating the living room, too. YouTube made up 9.7% of all viewership on connected and traditional TVs in the U.S. in May — the largest share of TV for a streaming platform ever reported by Nielsen's monthly ""The Gauge"" report. Netflix ranked second, claiming 7.6% of viewership. Among streamers only, YouTube's total viewership was close to 25% market share. ""We're not talking about your mobile phone, your laptop, that I'm sure you see your kids using all the time, but on the biggest screen in the house, the TV,"" said LightShed media analyst Rich Greenfield. ""Every [media] executive has to be paying attention."" But media companies such as Netflix, Disney and Warner Bros. Discovery aren't sure whether YouTube is friend or foe. Some media executives see YouTube as a companion platform to subscription streaming services and cable TV — an unwieldy behemoth of non-narrative, creator-led content with a social media slant that doesn't really fit the New York-Hollywood nexus of professional media. Others — even at times the same executives — view YouTube as an existential threat to the entertainment industry, stealing viewership from subscription streaming services and, with it, the cultural center of American youth. Those competing truths have led media and entertainment companies to concoct a wide array of strategies to combat the growing threat. Disney leaders discuss YouTube ""every day"" in strategic meetings and have considered adding user-generated content to Disney+, though it's not on the immediate roadmap, according to people familiar with the matter, who asked not to be named because the discussions are private. Netflix and Warner Bros. Discovery, on the other hand, have consciously chosen to focus on the other 90% of the TV viewing world that isn't YouTube. ""I do think it snuck up on people that YouTube was as important a presence in people's lives and people's viewing experiences not just on the phone but in the living room,"" said Tara Walpert Levy, YouTube's vice president of Americas, in an interview. ""When Nielsen first noted that YouTube was winning the streaming wars in terms of viewing, full stop, not just for ad-supported platforms, I had a ton of my friends from advertising, from media, who were like, 'Can you believe it?' It exceeded even our expectations,"" she said.

YouTube's growing dominance

Earlier this year, YouTube Chief Executive Officer Neal Mohan announced that users watch more than 1 billion hours of YouTube content on TV screens each day. More than 150 million Americans watch YouTube on connected TVs each month, according to the company. Ad dollars have followed. In 2023, YouTube took in $31.5 billion in advertising revenue, up 8% from 2022 and 271% from six years ago. In the first quarter of 2024, YouTube's ad revenue climbed 21% from a year earlier to $8.1 billion. YouTube, founded in 2005, sold to Google for $1.65 billion a year later. It's since ballooned in size as advertisers flocked to the platform. MoffettNathanson media analyst Michael Nathanson estimated in March that YouTube would be worth a whopping $400 billion as a standalone company — more than Disney and Comcast combined. ""YouTube is still the 800-pound gorilla in this space, and I do believe they're a pretty unstoppable juggernaut,"" said Candle Media co-CEO Kevin Mayer, who previously ran Disney's streaming business and was briefly CEO of TikTok.

Disney's YouTube focus

Disney executives are particularly attuned to YouTube's rising dominance, given its grip on younger people, according to people familiar with the company's thinking. Disney has a legion of super-fans who flock to YouTube and other social media sites to promote and critique its parks, rides and merchandise, movies and TV shows. Integrating some of that content as shoulder programming to Disney's scripted series and movies could help keep users on Disney+. A Disney spokesperson declined to comment on conversations about adding original content to the platform. The company claims 11.4% of TV viewership, according to Nielsen's ""The Gauge"" report, when adding up cable and streaming, including Hulu and ESPN.

You're betraying your audience. You're leaving YouTube to act, and then you're not posting online anymore, and you're asking them to wait on a project that's in development for what? A year, two years? People are going to forget about you, girl. That's how the internet works."" Brittany Broski YouTube creator

""I think what we're seeing from all of these traditional media companies is they don't have enough content, and it's too expensive to produce the types of premium content at scale that they need. And so maybe the [user-generated content] economy is a place they look ... not to create their competitor, but as a lower cost way to add content to their services,"" said LightShed's Greenfield. Disney is also considering putting more full episodes of Disney+ and Hulu series geared to older kids and adults directly on YouTube to entice an audience that isn't currently subscribing to its streaming platforms, said a person familiar with the matter. This is a strategy Disney has done with kids content for years, helping amplify hit animated series such as ""Bluey,"" ""Spidey and his Amazing Friends"" and ""Mickey Mouse Clubhouse.""

""At the end of the day, Disney is a storytelling machine,"" said Mayer. ""We used short-form video on YouTube as a promotional device for our content. But I don't think that we at Disney, nor have any other traditional media companies, leaned into YouTube as an original storytelling device the way they probably should have."" According to internal research, Disney executives concluded that younger Americans use YouTube as an online encyclopedia, said one of the people familiar with the company's discussions. That's led the company to focus on the benefits of the platform's discovery functionality while also programming against it, the person said. Disney has made bespoke YouTube content for its new preschool series ""Disney Junior's Ariel,"" which debuts June 27, to introduce the mermaid character to kids. It has also developed a series of ""Winnie the Pooh"" shorts so that it can research how the animated bear and his friends resonate with today's youth. The company is now considering making a full-length animated series on ""Winnie the Pooh"" based on the short-form video data, the person said.

Netflix's muted response

Netflix is taking on YouTube from a different angle. It doesn't view the platform as the same singular threat to viewership that some of its peers do. Netflix famously considers everything that could occupy a user's time, even sleep, as a long-term competitor. For the time being, Netflix executives consider YouTube as catering to a different consumer need. ""We have built a hard-to-replicate combination of a strong slate, superior recommendations, broad reach and intense fandom, which drives healthy engagement on Netflix. Improvement in these key areas is the best way to delight our members and continue to grow our business,"" Netflix said in its most recent quarterly shareholder letter. Netflix has even found some success duplicating content on YouTube in specific instances. ""Cocomelon,"" the animated toddler-geared short-form video series owned by Candle Media's Moonbug Entertainment, has become massively popular on both YouTube and Netflix. ""Cocomelon"" has 175 million subscribers to its English language YouTube channel, and ""many more if you add in all languages,"" Mayer said. At the same time, ""Cocomelon"" frequently tops Netflix's most-watched list among kids shows.

Posters showing ""Blippi"" and ""Cocomelon"" characters are displayed at the Moonbug Entertainment stand during the Brand Licensing Europe event at ExCel, in London, Oct. 04, 2023. John Keeble | Getty Images

The more immediate YouTube threat for Netflix comes from an advertising perspective. Netflix is now going head-to-head with YouTube for marketing dollars after introducing its ad-supported tier in November 2022. Netflix said in May that it has 40 million global monthly active users for its advertising tier. That's a far cry from YouTube's more than 2 billion monthly active users. Netflix is even contemplating launching free versions of its service in certain international markets to court advertisers, though there's nothing concrete planned, Bloomberg reported earlier this week. Netflix declined to comment for this story.

Other strategies

Comcast -owned NBCUniversal has experimented with new ways to copy the rabbit-hole effect of YouTube Shorts, which force-feed users content based on interest, by offering curated clips of ""Saturday Night Live"" sketches, scenes from ""The Office"" or favorite Bravo show moments. If younger users are being conditioned to watch in a certain way, NBCUniversal's Peacock streaming service wants to give consumers that choice in addition to its long-form movies and TV shows. But simply curating feeds within a content vertical now feels like a ""YouTube 1.0 strategy"" given how TikTok, YouTube Shorts and Instagram Reels have redefined short-form viewing, according to Nathanson. ""I don't think, at this point, there's a strategy in place among any of the traditional media players to create content for the YouTube generation that's more than just their branded strategy they're doing now,"" said Nathanson. ""The future strategy is to use AI to deliver personalization for each of us. Today, none of the traditional media players has that. That's YouTube 2.0."" Amazon is trying a more direct plan of attack — pay YouTube's biggest star to make a show for their own service. The company announced a deal earlier this year with MrBeast, whose real name is Jimmy Donaldson, to make a reality TV show, ""Beast Games,"" that will pay the winner $5 million in cash. The format will largely borrow from previous MrBeast giveaway videos that pit many contestants against each other for cash, using a ""fast-paced and high-production format,"" as Amazon has promised.

MrBeast's YouTube channel has the most subscribers worldwide at 289 million and expects to take in a whopping $700 million in revenue in 2024, primarily through advertising and brand deals. But while MrBeast may have crossover appeal, there's skepticism among creators that YouTube celebrities will have success making shows for subscription streaming services. Moreover, the entire Hollywood system may operate too slowly for a younger generation that demands immediate content.

YouTube's community

The popularity of YouTube stems from the authentic relationship creators have with their fans, according to Brittany Broski, 27, whose YouTube channel has more than 2 million subscribers. ""I still watch Netflix and HBO, where if I want a good fantasy series or whatever, I know where to go for that. But what YouTube is more concerned with is in this digital age, we've lost a sense of community and a sense of third spaces where we can go to hang out and meet new friends,"" Broski said. Broski's audience, which she described as Generation Z and young millennial women and members of the LGBTQ+ community, ballooned during the pandemic. Stuck at home with limited social options, hundreds of thousands of people found Broski as they searched for fresh, real-time content. That personal relationship is YouTube's secret sauce, and it doesn't translate when creators port to other services, Broski said. ""You're betraying your audience,"" said Broski. ""You're leaving YouTube to act, and then you're not posting online anymore, and you're asking them to wait on a project that's in development for what? A year, two years? People are going to forget about you, girl. That's how the internet works.""

Brittany Broski at VidCon 2022 in Anaheim, California, June 23, 2022. David Livingston | Getty Images Entertainment | Getty Images

The business model of YouTube for successful creators incentivizes staying on the platform. YouTube has shared more than $70 billion with its creators over the last three years through its Partner Program, which shares advertising revenue with more than 3 million channels on the platform. ""Why would I create a show and sell it to a network when I could just put it on YouTube?"" Broski said. ""You're self-funding, but if the money you're making from AdSense is going right back into your content to make more money, why do you even have to contact that third party?"" YouTube also benefits from a low barrier to entry to create content and from instant feedback through comments from fans that often help shape future content immediately. That model can't be replicated in a scripted form, where full seasons of TV shows are premade and rolled out on specific schedules. ""In the traditional industry, it's about proving to other people that the content deserves to be made, deserves to be seen, deserves a marketing campaign, deserves dollars behind it,"" said YouTube star and former professional cyclist Michelle Khare, 31, whose channel has more than 4.5 million subscribers. ""With YouTube, if you have the drive, the ability, and in many cases, your phone, you can skip those steps and put it out into a democratic platform where the audience ultimately decides what rises to the top.""

CNBC,https://www.cnbc.com/2024/06/26/biden-to-lower-some-drug-costs-through-inflation-penalties.html,2024-06-26,13:24:06 UTC,Biden administration to lower costs for 64 drugs through inflation penalties on drugmakers,"US President Joe Biden speaks during an event at the National Institutes of Health (NIH) in Bethesda, Maryland, US, on Thursday, Dec. 14 2023.

The Biden administration on Wednesday said it will impose inflation penalties on 64 prescription drugs for the third quarter of this year, lowering costs for certain older Americans enrolled in Medicare.

President Joe Biden has made lowering U.S. drug prices a key pillar of his health-care agenda and reelection platform for 2024. A provision of Biden's Inflation Reduction Act requires drugmakers to pay rebates to Medicare, the federal health program for Americans over age 65, if they hike the price of a medication faster than the rate of inflation.

It is separate from another provision under the law that allows Medicare to negotiate lower prescription drug prices with manufacturers. On average, Americans pay two to three times more than patients in other developed nations for prescription drugs, according to the Biden administration.

Some patients will pay a lower coinsurance rate for the 64 drugs covered under Wednesday's announcement, which fall under Medicare Part B, for the period from July 1 to Sept. 30 ""since each drug company raised prices faster than the rate of inflation,"" according to a release from the administration.

Some Medicare Part B patients may save as much as $4,593 per day if they use those drugs during the quarter, the release added.

More than 750,000 Medicare patients use the drugs each year, according to the release. The medications treat conditions such as cancer, certain infections and a bone disease called osteoporosis.

The list includes Bristol Myers Squibb's Abecma, a cell therapy for multiple myeloma; and Pfizer's targeted cancer treatment for certain lymphomas called Adectris. It also includes Astellas Pharma and Pfizer's Padcev, a targeted cancer treatment for advanced bladder cancer.

The Biden administration said Padcev's price has increased faster than inflation every quarter since the Medicare inflation rebate program went into effect last year.","The Biden administration on Wednesday said it will impose inflation penalties on 64 prescription drugs for the third quarter of this year, lowering costs for certain older Americans enrolled in Medicare.

Delta Air Lines is the country's most profitable airline. CEO Ed Bastian's challenge is to make sure his carrier stays on top. The airline's unit revenue, the amount it brings in for every seat it flies one mile, outpaced its competitors' last year. Delta's share price has soared more than 17% in 2024, one of the strongest performers in the rocky airline sector, in a rally that's outdone the S&P 500 's. It expects free cash flow to rise as much as 50% this year to between $3 billion and $4 billion, and is eyeing a return to an investment-grade credit rating. And a stat any traveler would appreciate: Delta came in first in punctuality last year, with more than 83% of its flights arriving on time, according to the Transportation Department. Rival United Airlines — second to Delta in net profit margins — is circling. It says it could grow profit even more this year. ""Knowing that there's someone that thinks that they can take that mantle from us, that keeps us on our toes and keeps us continuing to drive hard,"" Bastian told CNBC.

Delta has fashioned itself as America's premium airline. It has won over hordes of splurging travelers, many of them carrying American Express cards, Delta's cash cow of a partner that generated almost $7 billion for the airline last year. Sales growth of Delta's roomier and more expensive seats continues to outpace revenue from standard coach. As they vie for luxury flyers, both Delta and United have added more high-end seating to their planes to cater to travelers who deem worthwhile a $300 surcharge for a few inches of extra legroom on a cross-country round trip, or 10 times as much for a seat in business class. Bastian, a former auditor who said he took his first flight at age 25 for a business trip (New York to Chicago), is in charge of ensuring Delta lives up to its brand luster. On Wednesday, Delta took its next shot in the battle for high-spending flyers when it opened its newest, highest tier of airport lounge at New York's John F. Kennedy International Airport for passengers in its Delta One cabin, its top cabin that features lie-flat beds for longer flights. At more than 39,000 square feet it is Delta's largest lounge, accented with pillows that have the iconic zigzag motif of Italian fashion house Missoni, its new amenity kit partner. It features complimentary spa treatments, like ice globes and serum for jet-lagged eyes, along with showers, a full restaurant, and a deck overlooking the airfield, in a bet that travelers' desire to treat themselves is here to stay. Delta is taking a page from the playbooks of United and American , which already dedicate their swankiest lounges to customers flying in long-haul business class. Delta plans to open Delta One lounges in Boston and Los Angeles later this year, and is studying airports where it could open others. ""The thing with this industry is no good idea goes uncopied,"" said Raymond James airline analyst Savanthi Syth. Meanwhile, United is placing huge orders for new Boeing and Airbus planes and remodeling hundreds of narrow-body cabins that feature seatback screens and Bluetooth technology, a strategy that aims to cater to travelers from international business class to those flying on the cheapest basic economy tickets. ""We haven't exactly achieved the No. 1 profitability status in the industry, but I know we're on our way,"" United's chief commercial officer, Andrew Nocella, said in an interview last month. ""If we continue to invest in our customers through great service and great products and great network, we know that will feed upon itself and it'll help us achieve the financial results that we're looking for."" Delta, United and American are approaching their 100th birthdays, and are trying to stay ahead — if not drive — shifting travel demand and still turn a profit. United is adding to the more than 300 airports it serves. Figuring out the next hot destination is ""part art"" and ""part science,"" said Patrick Quayle, its head of network planning. The airline's sprawling global network makes United the biggest U.S. airline by capacity and it recently launched service to places like Dubrovnik, Croatia, and Amman, Jordan. Quayle pointed to United's addition of Cape Town, South Africa, which it first announced before the pandemic, as a success. ""Another airline has subsequently copied us. ... I might want to add based in Atlanta,"" he said, alluding to Delta's home city. The latest changes come at a difficult time for a lot of U.S. airlines. Labor and other costs swelled after the pandemic, eating into margins despite record numbers of travelers. Added capacity in the U.S. market has forced carriers to discount fares in off-peak travel periods. It's tricky, and expensive, to change course. Even Southwest Airlines is facing investor pressure to add things like premium seating or seat assignments as its simple, but long successful, business model shows signs of age.

Meanwhile, U.S. consumers are growing more selective: Some corporate leaders have lamented a spending pullback while others, like Delta's CEO, are saying the opposite. Americans are still digging into the so-called experiences economy, and paying for more comfort along the way, according to Bastian. ""They may not be buying that new EV or that new house, but they're saying we're going to go out and experience the world and invest in that experience,"" he said. ""And that's why you see it happening in high-end concerts, high-end hospitality.""

'Brick by brick'

When the U.S. was careening toward recession almost two decades ago, Delta's leaders made a correct bet that travelers would eventually pay more to fly on its jets. Delta was emerging from Chapter 11 bankruptcy in 2007, which other U.S. carriers found themselves in the years after the Sept. 11, 2001, terrorist attacks. Former CEO Richard Anderson said the airline had to start with basics: stop losing bags. Make sure flights didn't get canceled and arrived on time. Clean up the cabins. ""It was about building the operation brick by brick,"" said Anderson, who handed the reins to Delta's former president, Bastian, in 2016. ""It didn't matter what you did with AmEx. If the flight canceled, you ruined your brand."" Delta took better care to avoid maintenance problems. It also started ferrying planes to airports to avoid cancellations if a replacement aircraft was needed. And the carrier tried to clean up its image, hiring a marketing firm that advised former President Barack Obama's 2008 presidential campaign.

Anderson said the airline needed to be consistent and not fly its mix of paint jobs and cabin interiors. It faced fresh competition from low-cost airlines like a then-spritely upstart out of Queens, New York, called JetBlue Airways . Delta and United had both launched their own low-cost subsidiaries, but they discontinued them. Delta executives knew they needed a brand to match if they were going to command a premium over competitors. ""One of the things about being a premium product is consistency, consistency in policy, consistency in appearance,"" said Anderson. ""If you got on a flight in Tokyo we wanted you to feel like you were home."" After the string of changes, Delta's performance improved. Corporate business travel contracts helped boost profits and still do, as business travel returns post-pandemic. Delta had a key advantage over competitors. After it came out of bankruptcy, it merged with Northwest Airlines in 2008, allowing it to stabilize and expand around the world while other carriers floundered. The rest of the industry spent much of the next decade recovering from bankruptcies and a subsequent musical chairs of mergers that left four big carriers in control of about three-quarters of the U.S. domestic market. Delta's rivals were years behind the carrier on integrating their merged staff, operations, networks and fleets. Bastian said Delta's focus on reliability has made life easier for not just its customers, but also its employees. ""They're not having to explain for a cancellation or mishandled luggage,"" he said. ""They have time to serve rather than to apologize."" Delta is also unique as the least unionized of the major U.S. airlines, at about 20%. In April, as campaigns were underway to organize its flight attendants and other workers, it again raised worker pay. Flight attendants for Delta's regional carrier, Endeavor, which are unionized, have recently demanded compensation on par with the carrier's mainline flight attendants.

Time to remodel

After Delta got the basics down, Bastian, 67, who joined Delta in 1998, said it was time for the airline to focus on more ambitious projects. ""You had the liberty to start investing in premium,"" he said. ""You started to figure out how to make first class more available to customers."" It has expanded in big-spending New York and Los Angeles, the country's two largest air travel markets by revenue, according to aviation data firm OAG. Delta also built up its host of global alliances, joint ventures and minority ownership stakes, giving it more reach. That includes its 49% stake in Virgin Atlantic, which already had a strong foothold in premium air travel and popular lounges. ""I think some of that heritage has made its way into the core of Delta,"" said Virgin Atlantic's CEO, Shai Weiss. ""I'm not suggesting we are the messiah for Delta, but there is no surprise that Delta and Virgin Atlantic see eye to eye on many things."" The vast majority of the more than 940 million people who flew on U.S. airlines last year fly in coach, and Delta has tried to make its flights more desirable to travelers on all sections of the plane. It remodeled old and dated terminals, and built out its network of luxury airport lounges, which are tied to its lucrative credit card deal with American Express. It added seatback televisions and better in-flight entertainment options, and in February 2023, it announced its long-awaited free Wi-Fi to customers enrolled in its SkyMiles frequent flyer program.

Delta has invested more than $12 billion to rebuild and update its U.S. hubs with soaring ceilings, new technology and in some lounges, a signature scent. (""It's proprietary,"" said Claude Roussel, who oversees Delta's lounges, when asked what was in it.) One of its latest efforts is its terminal and new Sky Club at New York's LaGuardia Airport, alongside other airlines' new terminals. A decade ago, then-Vice President Joe Biden famously said someone who was blindfolded and taken to that airport would think, ""I must be in some third-world country."" The airline faced big problems along the way like a dayslong system outage in 2016. And the worst of all: Covid-19. Like other airlines, Delta accepted billions in federal aid to weather the pandemic. The carrier successfully urged some 17,000 workers to take buyouts, hiring newer, lower-paid staff who lacked the experience of departed employees. Early in the process, Bastian said the newer workers gave the company a ""juniority benefit."" The airline employed about 100,000 people in the U.S. as of the end of last year. Delta and its competitors also pulled out of many small cities as the pandemic eased, isolating some smaller cities amid a shortage of regional jet pilots. But international travel has proved resilient so far, as consumers show they are willing to shell out on experiences.

Luxury air travel? In the U.S.?

Luxury air travel and the United States didn't go together for many years — and might not still, if you ask well-heeled globetrotters. U.S. airlines don't offer on-board showers or roomy suites like those on the superjumbos flown by the likes of Etihad Airways or Singapore Airlines. But the U.S. air travel market, the world's largest, has gotten a number of upgrades in recent years, and travelers have grown to expect the same convenience they get from their online shopping sites and ride-hailing and food-ordering apps. ""Delta's not bougie by any stretch, but when your competitors don't try very hard, it doesn't take much,"" said Henry Harteveldt, a former airline executive and founder of Atmosphere Research Group. But as a rewards credit card boom, strong consumer spending, social media envy and a wanderlust that predated the pandemic combined to boost demand, airlines executives were taking notice. Delta's sales from premium products are growing faster than revenue from its main coach cabin, a trend the airline forecasts will continue. Sales from Delta's loyalty business, premium cabins and other streams comprise more than half of the carrier's revenue. Airlines have made big changes as they struggle to accommodate the swelling numbers of big-spending travelers armed with elite status. Major carriers have all overhauled their frequent flyer programs to reward the biggest spenders instead of those who fly the most miles, and made it harder to earn coveted elite status. And at Delta and other airlines, many of the perks for luxury flyers come through lounges. One of Delta's Sky Clubs at Los Angeles International Airport offers a separate, dedicated security checkpoint for customers flying Delta One, away from the masses at the airport. That feature will make it to the new JFK lounge later this year, a Delta spokesman said. United and American Airlines have also worked to glam up and expand their airport lounges, access to which is a common perk with credit cards. Delta softened some restrictions on Sky Club lounge access last year — which it made to end annoying and unsightly long lines to enter its exclusive airport real estate — after an uproar from customers.

'We're constantly pushing each other""

Both Delta and United have issued sunny financial forecasts for this year, while many carriers are losing money or not pulling in similar profit margins. ""Watching [Delta] succeed, I became convinced that the product mattered and service mattered, and we have done that at United now,"" United CEO Scott Kirby said at a JPMorgan industry conference in March. And at an investor conference last month, he pointed to how the two are pulling away from the rest of the pack in profitability, particularly at big hubs. United has made some big bets that paid off. It held onto its wide-body planes, when travel demand collapsed in the pandemic, and has benefited from the surge in international travel. With United on Delta's tail, Bastian is trying to expand the airline's reach. Bastian has attended the massive Consumer Electronics Show in Las Vegas and has announced new partnerships with Lyft and Starbucks for its loyalty program.

CNBC,https://www.cnbc.com/2024/06/25/volkswagen-rivian-stake.html,2024-06-25,23:41:08 UTC,"Rivian secures up to $5 billion from Volkswagen, shares soar more than 50%","Volkswagen Group plans to invest up to $5 billion in electric vehicle startup Rivian , starting with an initial investment of $1 billion.

The additional $4 billion is expected by 2026. It includes plans for $1 billion each in 2025 and 2026, followed by $2 billion in 2026 related to an expected joint venture to create electrical architecture and software technology, according to a release by the automakers Tuesday.

Shares of Rivian soared more than 50% during after-hours trading Tuesday, two days ahead of an investor event for Rivian, which has been under pressure from Wall Street due to its cash burn and significant losses. Rivian stock closed Tuesday at $11.96 a share, down roughly 49% in 2024.

The initial $1 billion from Volkswagen will be in the form of a convertible note, which could be converted to Rivian shares on or after Dec. 1, the release said.

The deal will help Rivian on its journey to become cash flow-positive, Rivian CEO and founder RJ Scaringe said Tuesday night during an investor call.

He noted the capital is expected to carry the company through the production ramp-up of its smaller R2 SUVs at its plant in Normal, Illinois, starting in 2026, as well as production of the midsize EV platform at a plant in Georgia, where Rivian paused construction earlier this year.","Volkswagen Group plans to invest up to $5 billion in electric vehicle startup Rivian , starting with an initial investment of $1 billion.

CNBC,https://www.cnbc.com/2024/06/25/fedex-fdx-earnings-q4-2024.html,2024-06-25,22:54:46 UTC,FedEx shares jump after hours as massive cost-cutting measures kick in,"FedEx shares soared more than 15% after hours Tuesday after the company reported results that topped analysts' estimates in both earnings and revenue.

Here's how the company did in its fiscal fourth quarter compared with what Wall Street was anticipating, based on a survey of analysts by LSEG:

Earnings per share : $5.41 adjusted vs. $5.35 expected

: $5.41 adjusted vs. $5.35 expected Revenue: $22.11 billion vs. $22.07 billion expected

The company reported net income for the three-month period that ended May 31 of $1.47 billion, or $5.94 per share, compared with $1.54 billion, or $6.05 per share, a year earlier.

Revenue rose to $22.1 billion, up slightly from $21.9 billion a year earlier. For the full fiscal year, revenue was $87.7 billion, down from $90.2 billion.

FedEx reported that capital spending for fiscal 2024 was $5.2 billion, down 16% from $6.2 billion in fiscal 2023 and less than the $5.7 billion it forecasted in its fiscal 2024 guidance last year.

For fiscal 2025, the company said it expects low to mid-single-digit revenue growth year over year, driven in large part by e-commerce and low-inventory levels, FedEx Chief Customer Officer Brie Carere said on the company's earnings call.

""We think e-commerce is going to outpace the B2B growth,"" Carere said. ""We like the fundamentals from an e-commerce perspective that will help us here in the United States and around the world.""

The capital spending decline comes as the company amps up its cost-cutting measures as part of a sweeping commitment to cut $4 billion by the end of fiscal 2025.

Following weak freight demand, FedEx enacted its DRIVE transformation program to cut costs and consolidate the business.

""DRIVE continues to change the way we work at FedEx. We achieved our target of $1.8 billion in structural costs out in fiscal year '24,"" CEO Raj Subramaniam said on the call.

Subramaniam said the company is firmly on track to achieve the $4 billion cost-cutting goal and further expects another $2 billion from the company's plans to consolidate its air and ground services.

As part of the DRIVE initiative, FedEx announced in April 2023 that it will be consolidating its delivery companies Express, Ground, Services and others into a unified Federal Express Corporation, operating under the FedEx brand and alongside the company's Freight segment which will continue to exist separately. The company said at the time that it expects the combined delivery business to handle all deliveries starting June 2024.

The newly combined segments are expected to be the larger driver of fiscal year 2025 adjusted income and margin improvement, finance chief John Dietrich said on the call.

FedEx further expects the demand environment to moderately improve through the next fiscal year, according to Carere.

Investor's eyes are also on the company's largest segment Express, which has been struggling with margin growth the past year. The segment's margins ended the fourth quarter at 4.1%, unchanged year over year. Its operating margin for fiscal 2024 was 2.6%, up slightly from 2.5% last year.

Subramaniam said improving performance of the Express segment is a ""top priority"" for the company.

While the company hiked its quarterly dividend by 10% earlier this month, investors do foresee headwinds, particularly after the company lost its U.S. Postal Service contract to rival United Parcel Service n April.

UPS will become the primary air cargo provider for USPS starting Sept. 30, after FedEx's contract expires. USPS was the largest customer for the company's Express segment. The company shared that it expects a $500 million headwind from the loss in fiscal 2025.","FedEx shares soared more than 15% after hours Tuesday after the company reported results that topped analysts' estimates in both earnings and revenue.

The stock pared losses slightly to trade down 13% by 9:00 a.m. London time.

The world's second largest retailer said operating profit for the period between March and May came in at 7.1 billion Swedish kroner ($672 million), below the 7.37 billion Swedish kroner anticipated by analysts, according to an LSEG poll cited by Reuters.

The second-quarter result was nevertheless above the 4.7 billion Swedish kroner recorded in the same period last year.

The company also said that bad weather was likely to dampen sales in June, which it expects to decline by 6% in local currencies, compared with the same period of last year.

Further weighing on stock, H&M CEO Daniel Ervér cast doubt over the company's ability to meet its margin target this year.

""Our goal of an operating margin of 10 percent for full-year 2024 remains in place,"" he said. ""However, the conditions for achieving that level this year have become more challenging as it is assessed that external factors that influence our purchasing costs and sales revenues, including materials and foreign currency, will have a more negative impact than we expected in the second half of the year.""

He added that the company was continuing to invest in both its online and in store experiences, with upgrades to stores in Paris, Milan, Berlin, Stockholm, Hamburg and Munich to follow those already undertaken in New York, London and Tokyo.

It comes as higher living costs and a slowdown in post-pandemic spending have weighed on both high street and luxury retail sales.

Earlier this month, Zara owner Inditex reported a slowdown in first-quarter sales compared to the previous year's growth, but pointed to an uptick in May.

Meanwhile, Chinese-founded fast fashion giant Shein has been encroaching on European retailers, as it prepares for a public listing in London.","Shares of H&M plunged more than 14% on Thursday morning after the company reported a smaller-than-expected increase in second-quarter profits and cast doubt over its June sales and full-year profit margin target.

CNBC,https://www.cnbc.com/2024/06/26/micron-shares-slide-after-revenue-forecast-fails-to-top-estimates.html,2024-06-26,22:51:00 UTC,Micron shares slide after revenue forecast fails to top estimates,"Sanjay Mehrotra, Micron Technology President & CEO at the WEF in Davos, Switzerland on May 24th, 2022.

Micron shares fell about 7% in extended trading on Wednesday as investors looked past better-than-expected results and focused instead on a revenue forecast that was in line with estimates.

Here's how the company did versus LSEG consensus estimates for the fiscal third quarter ended May 30:

Earnings per share : 62 cents adjusted vs. 51 cents expected

: 62 cents adjusted vs. 51 cents expected Revenue: $6.81 billion vs. $6.67 billion expected

Micron, which makes computer memory and storage, said it expects adjusted earnings per share of $1.08 on revenue of $7.6 billion in the current quarter. Analysts were expecting earnings per share of $1.05 on revenue of $7.6 billion.

The shares have more than doubled in the past year as the company rides the artificial intelligence boom. Micron's most advanced memory is needed for AI graphics processing units (GPUs) like Nvidia's , putting the company in position to benefit from demand for technology to train and deploy AI applications like OpenAI's ChatGPT.

Micron reported $332 million in net income, or 30 cents per share, versus a net loss of $1.9 billion, or $1.73 per share, in the year-ago quarter.

Micron CEO Sanjay Mehrotra highlighted the company's AI business in a statement while saying that its smartphone and PC markets remain sluggish.

Mehrotra said the company's AI-oriented products were likely to increase in price and that the company's data center business grew 50% on a quarter-to-quarter basis.

""Robust AI-driven demand for data center products is causing tightness on our leading-edge nodes,"" Mehrotra said in a statement. ""Consequently, we expect continued price increases throughout calendar 2024 despite only steady near-term demand in PCs and smartphones.""

On a call with analysts, Micron said that its high bandwidth memory, the kind used in AI chips, is sold out through 2025.

""We believe that Micron will be one of the biggest beneficiaries in the semiconductor industry in the multiyear growth opportunity driven by AI,"" Mehrotra said.

In a lyric on her latest album, Beyoncé sings ""denim on denim, on denim, on denim."" Levi Strauss shoppers are taking that advice to heart. Levi Strauss executives are ecstatic. Western wear is booming as consumers opt for top-to-bottom denim looks, the iconic, 171-year-old clothing maker said on Wednesday. As the style wins cultural favor, its popularity is juicing denim niches — like shirts, skirts and dresses — that fall outside Levi's widely-known blue jean offerings. ""The growing popularity of Western wear is at an all-time high,"" CEO Michelle Gass told analysts Wednesday night after the California-based retailer's latest earnings report for the quarter ended in May. A Western renaissance has been gaining traction over the past several months, sending stylish shoppers searching for pieces like jeans, boots and cowboy hats. Levi's scored a huge hit when its jean brand was referenced in Beyoncé's song ""Levii's Jeans,"" released earlier this year. Beyond Beyoncé's chart-topping ""Cowboy Carter"" album, the increased ubiquity of Western style has also been tied to a fashion line unveiled by Louis Vuitton earlier this year and Taylor Swift's ongoing Eras Tour.

Gass, who took over as Levi Strauss CEO earlier this year after previously serving as the CEO at Kohl's , has touted that denim is having a moment in the popular imagination, with Western wear trending more broadly throughout the culture. More specific data shared on the company's earnings call Wednesday showed how Levi Strauss is taking advantage of demand for denim beyond its popular ""501"" jeans. Sales of denim skirts, jumpsuits and dresses all at least doubled in the latest quarter, Gass said. Western shirts sales are also up significantly, she said, especially on the women's side. Levi is find success in what the 55-year-old chief executive described as a new strategy of trying to dress customers denim — from head-to-toe. ""Our new focus is, yes, continuing to own jeans, but taking that denim top to bottom,"" Gass said on CNBC's ""Mad Money"" late Wednesday. While noting that the denim skirt and dress categories haven't been historically large for the company, now ""they're exploding,"" she said.

Denim rage sets a high bar on Wall Street

To be sure, the well-documented denim craze alone isn't necessarily impressing Wall Street. Levi Strauss tumbled more than 15% on Thursday in response to its latest numbers, its second worst day since going public in early 2019. Levi Strauss posted $1.44 billion in revenue in the fiscal second quarter, slightly missing the $1.45 billion consensus forecast of analysts polled by LSEG despite the denim boom. The company's finance chief told CNBC that the sales miss was driven by unfavorable foreign exchange rates and weakness in the Dockers brand. On the other hand, Levi Strauss earned 16 cents per share, excluding items, ahead of the 11-cent average estimate by analysts. In the year through Wednesday, shares had run up amid the buzz around the cotton-based fabric and the resurgence of Western clothing. Following Thursday's drop, the stock is still up more than 18% on the year. For comparison, shares of Kontoor Brands , the parent of denim brands Wrangler and Lee, have risen 5% year to date.

CNBC,https://www.cnbc.com/2024/06/27/theres-a-big-fed-inflation-reading-coming-friday-heres-what-to-expect.html,2024-06-28,10:56:54 UTC,There's a big Fed inflation reading coming Friday. Here's what to expect,"People purchase beverages in a store on a sweltering afternoon in Brooklyn, New York, on the first day of summer on June 21, 2024.

The official Dow Jones forecasts for Friday's numbers are for the headline, or all-item, PCE price reading to come in flat on the month, while core is projected to rise 0.1%. That would compare to respective increases of 0.3% and 0.2% in April . Both headline and core are forecast at 2.6% on a year-over-year basis.

If that date rings a bell, it's when core PCE first passed the Fed's coveted 2% inflation target during this cycle. Despite a series of aggressive interest rate increases since then, the central bank has yet to wrest the pace of price increases back into its target range.

But even more importantly, when stripping out volatile food and energy prices, the core PCE price index, which draws even closer scrutiny from Fed policymakers, is set to indicate its lowest annual reading since March 2021.

The personal consumption expenditures price index, an inflation measure the Federal Reserve watches closely, is expected to show little, if any, monthly increase for May, the first time that would be the case since November 2023.

There could be some pretty good inflation news on the way from the Commerce Department when it releases a key economic report Friday.

Should the core PCE price forecasts transpire, it will serve as a milestone of sorts.

""We are in line with [the forecast] that the PCE core pricing data will come in soft,"" said Beth Ann Bovino, chief economist at U.S. Bank. ""That's good news for the Fed. It's also good for people's pocketbooks, although I don't know if people feel it just yet.""

Indeed, while the rate of inflation has receded precipitously from its mid-2022 peak, prices have not. Since that March 2021 benchmark, core PCE is up 14%.

That steep climb and its pernicious effect is why Fed officials are not ready to declare victory yet, despite the obvious progress made since the rate hikes began in March 2022.

""Returning inflation sustainably to our 2% target is an ongoing process and not a fait accompli,"" Fed Governor Lisa Cook said earlier this week.

Cook and her colleagues have been circumspect about the timing and pace of rate cuts, though most agree that easing is likely at some point this year as long as the data stays in line. Futures markets are currently pricing in a good likelihood that the Fed will enact its first quarter-percentage-point cut in September, with another to follow by the end of the year. Policymakers at their meeting earlier this month penciled in just one cut.

""We do expect softening in the real economy — not falling off a cliff, just softening — that suggests that inflation will be softer as well later on. That gives us reason to expect the Fed will be able to likely have their first cut in September,"" Bovino said.

""Now we all know it depends on the data and the Fed is still watching,"" she added. ""Could they wait? Could it just be a one and done this year? I can't rule it out. But it does look like the numbers might give the Fed cover to cut rates two times this year.""

In addition to the inflation numbers, the Commerce Department at 8:30 a.m. ET will release figures on personal income and consumer spending, with estimates at a rise of 0.4% and 0.3%, respectively.","If that date rings a bell, it's when core PCE first passed the Fed's coveted 2% inflation target during this cycle.

The annual survey conducted by the China General Chamber of Commerce in the U.S. found that nearly 60% of companies aim to maintain a stable level of investment and that about 30% plan to boost it.

""A notable degree of long-term optimism persisted, with the majority expressing positive future revenue expectations,"" CGCC said, adding that the survey reflected ""a commendable sense of optimism, determination, and resilience.""

The survey was conducted in April and May of this year, polling nearly 100 Chinese companies across various industries about performance and outlook.

The report said Chinese firms remain committed to the U.S. market despite growing negative sentiment about the overall business environment amid rising trade tensions between the world's two largest economies.

Over 60% of survey respondents saw a deteriorating business environment in the U.S. Meanwhile, the rate of concern regarding a ""stalemate in Sino-US bilateral relations political and cultural relations"" surged to 93% from 81% a year prior.

Over the past year, the Biden administration has ramped up curbs on Chinese businesses, scrutinizing certain China-dominated industries, placing new sanctions on various Chinese firms and goods and trying to outright block Chinese ownership of certain companies and platforms.","A recent survey of Chinese enterprises in the U.S. has found that a majority remain bullish on the market long term despite growing concerns about U.S.-China relations and the broader business environment.

CNBC,https://www.cnbc.com/2024/06/25/fed-governor-bowman-says-shes-still-open-to-raising-rates-if-inflation-doesnt-improve.html,2024-06-25,16:07:05 UTC,Fed Governor Bowman says she's still open to raising rates if inflation doesn't improve,"Michelle Bowman, governor of the US Federal Reserve, speaks during the Exchequer Club meeting in Washington, DC, US, on Wednesday, Feb. 21, 2024.

Federal Reserve Governor Michelle Bowman said Tuesday the time is not right yet to start lowering interest rates, adding she would be open to raising if inflation doesn't pull back.

""Should the incoming data indicate that inflation is moving sustainably toward our 2 percent goal, it will eventually become appropriate to gradually lower the federal funds rate to prevent monetary policy from becoming overly restrictive,"" Bowman said in prepared remarks for a speech in London. ""However, we are still not yet at the point where it is appropriate to lower the policy rate.""

Those comments reflect a prevailing sentiment at the central bank, in which most policymakers have said in recent weeks that, while they still expect inflation to get back to the Fed's 2% target, they need more evidence.

Recent readings have shown moderating inflation, with the Fed's preferred indicator running just under 3%. However, the rate-setting Federal Open Market Committee noted after its last meeting that there has been only ""modest further progress.""

Bowman noted that there are ""a number of upside risks"" prevailing that could accelerate her outlook, which is among the most hawkish of all policymakers.

""I remain willing to raise the target range for the federal funds rate at a future meeting should progress on inflation stall or even reverse,"" she said. ""Given the risks and uncertainties regarding my economic outlook, I will remain cautious in my approach to considering future changes in the stance of policy.""

The Commerce Department on Friday will release its reading on the May personal consumption expenditures price index, the Fed's preferred inflation gauge. Economists surveyed by Dow Jones expect a 12-month inflation rate of 2.6% on both the all-items and core, which excludes food and energy prices.

While that would represent a nudge lower from April, Bowman said she still expects the Fed to hold its key overnight borrowing rate in a range between 5.25%-5.50% ""for some time.""

Moreover, she indicated she is not being swayed by rate reductions from the Fed's global counterparts such as the European Central Bank, which recently lowered its key rates by a quarter percentage point. Bowman said ""it is possible over the coming months that the path of monetary policy in the U.S. will diverge from that of other advanced economies.""

In other Fed news Tuesday, Governor Lisa Cook expressed optimism that inflation would show more significant progress in 2025, allowing the Fed to lower rates at some point.

""With significant progress on inflation and the labor market cooling gradually, at some point it will be appropriate to reduce the level of policy restriction to maintain a healthy balance in the economy,"" Cook told the Economic Club of New York.

While Cook said she is optimistic that inflation will head lower and supply and demand in the labor market is coming into better balance, she also noted that risk factors remain. They include higher credit card delinquency rates and tighter credit conditions, along with the difficulty in assessing economic data that has come under continuous and significant revision.

Both officials' remarks follow other policymakers saying Monday that they're hesitant to cut.

San Francisco Fed President Mary Daly rejected the idea of doing a preemptive cut to hedge against deterioration in the labor market and a slowing economy.

""I do think that preemptive cutting is something that you do when you see risks,"" Daly told CNBC's Deirdre Bosa during a public event in San Francisco. ""We're going to be resolute until we finish the job. That's why not taking preemptive action when it's not necessary is so important.""

Also, Chicago Fed President Austan Goolsbee told CNBC's Steve Liesman earlier on Monday that if he sees ""more months"" of good inflation data, then he would question whether policy needs to be as restrictive as it has been, paving the way for cuts.

As governors, Cook and Bowman are permanent FOMC voters. Daly also gets a vote this year while Goolsbee does not, though he does get a voice at meetings and submits his forecast to the committee's

CNBC,https://www.cnbc.com/2024/06/29/two-paths-for-jana-to-bolster-shareholder-value-at-rapid7.html,2024-06-29,11:55:40 UTC,Activist Jana has a stake in Rapid7. There are two paths to bolster value at the cybersecurity company,"Business: Rapid7 is a global cybersecurity software and services provider. Its products span across information security, cloud operations, development and information technology teams, enabling them to understand attackers and leverage that information to take control of their fragmented attack surface. Rapid7 Managed Threat Complete is the company's flagship offering, and it includes the Rapid7 Managed Detection and Response program. Rapid7 also provides risk and threat coverage through InsightIDR and Insight VM services, making them available in a single package. Its security solutions help more than 11,000 global customers unite cloud risk management and threat detection.

Activist Commentary: Jana is a very experienced activist investor founded in 2001 by Barry Rosenstein. The firm made its name taking deeply researched activist positions with well-conceived plans for long term value. Rosenstein called his activist strategy ""V cubed."" The three ""Vs"" were"" (i) Value: buying at the right price; (ii) Votes: knowing whether you have the votes before commencing a proxy fight; and (iii) Variety of ways to win: having more than one strategy to enhance value and exit an investment. Since 2008, the firm has gradually shifted that strategy to one which we characterize as the three ""Ss"" (i) Stock price: buying at the right price; (ii) Strategic activism: sale of company or spinoff of a business; and (iii) Star advisors/nominees: aligning with top industry executives to advise them and take board seats if necessary.

Rapid7 is a cybersecurity company that expands the expertise of its clients' security operations. Its Managed Threat Complete flagship offering combines end-to-end 24/7 managed detection and response with vulnerability management offerings. Historically, the company has focused on on-site cybersecurity operations, but it has begun to expand into the explosive growth area of cloud security. Rapid7 operates in a highly attractive industry and is the beneficiary of some meaningful tailwinds. In a time where software budgets are being cut or reallocated toward AI, the threat of cyberattacks looms large and presents a great enough risk that spend is either flat or increasing for these types of services. In addition, cybersecurity analysts and internal security staff are limited, so there is a tremendous need for outsourcing. With more complex operations and numerous applications both on-site and in the cloud, Rapid7 is well-positioned to continue growing and aims to be a high-quality provider for subject matter experts who may not be able to retain the services of their largest and most expensive competitors.

Despite its favorable position, the company has delivered negative returns on a one-, three-, and five-year basis. Rapid7 is one of three main players in vulnerability management, yet it's assigned a much smaller revenue multiple (3x) compared to peers Tenable (5.5x) and Qualys (8x). One factor in this is that Rapid7 offers a combination of low- and high-growth cybersecurity offerings, which is difficult to value, but more important are the multiple slip-ups by management, exacerbated by a lack of oversight by the board. First, the company has undergone changes to its sales model, including a shift to selling packaged products from selling offerings individually. It's also moved to a channel model from direct. Next, the company has encountered challenges in bringing its cloud product to market. In addition, to shift from pure growth to a profitable software company, Rapid7 has focused on meeting targets for $160 million in free cash flow and improved margins. In August 2023, likely in pursuit of these goals, the company abruptly announced plans to reduce its staff by 18%. Rapid7 has had further retention problems in key executive roles, including the departure of its chief innovation officer and its critically important chief operating officer and president. Finally, the company has not been able to properly make forecasts, leading to tremendous investor uncertainty and questions of board oversight. In February 2024, the company announced its 2024 guidance, which it stated it was highly confident in, only to cut it in May when the company delivered its Q1 results. That led to a 17% stock price decline on May 8. This is a company operating in a highly complex and dynamic space – it is doing everything all at once and has seemingly failed to deliver.

With a company like this, there are generally two paths to shareholder value creation: (i) a long-term plan involving board reconstitution, management overhaul and review of strategic and operational plans and (ii) a shorter-term plan to sell the company to an interested buyer who can make those changes. With respect to the long-term plan, Jana generally works with industry executives and consultants in performing due diligence and implementing its activist plans, and we do not expect this situation to be different. The firm will often bring these individuals to the table to serve as director nominees, if deemed necessary. Jana is experienced in getting these experts on company boards, where they often serve as assets in getting the company to correct its issues, from operational to governance to capital allocation. But Jana also has extensive experience in strategic activism and getting portfolio companies sold. We expect that Jana will advocate for the strategy it expects will maximize shareholder value on a risk- and time-adjusted basis. Given the problems the company has been experiencing and the lack of CEO focus (Aside from being chairman and CEO of Rapid7, Corey Thomas is on the National Security Telecommunications Advisory Committee, chair of the Federal Reserve Bank of Boston and a member of the Council on Foreign Relations. He also serves on the boards of the Blue Cross Blue Shield of Massachusetts, LPL Financial and Vanderbilt University.), a sale looks like it could be the easier and more certain path if there is a suitor at the right price.

Given industry tailwinds, there may be several strategic and financial buyers interested in this company. Recent transactions in the cybersecurity sector include Cisco's $28 billion takeover of Splunk and Francisco Partners' $1.7 billion acquisition of Sumo Logic. If Jana does advocate for a sale of Rapid7, it will ask the board to do it through a full sales process that attains the highest value for shareholders. In addition, Jana has a strategic partnership with Cannae Holdings, which could be helpful in providing the equity in a strategic transaction with a private equity firm. Consider that in 2019, Cannae joined with private-equity firms to buy Dun & Bradstreet. It is important to note that even if Jana thinks a sale of the company is the best way to optimize shareholder value, the firm will still have to get the board to agree. This does not look like a board and management team that will just go quietly. In such a case, Jana's remedy would be to launch a proxy fight, but that could take some time. The 2024 annual meeting just passed on June 13 and the director nomination window does not open until Feb.13, 2025.

“Anthem of Grace” kicked off with a massive global broadcast on Good Friday, hitting tens of millions of people with the Gospel. Translated into 60 languages, millions more are still consuming the content in nations across the world months after the event was first aired.

“It’s been amazing to see what God is doing,” Hall, founder of the Pulse Movement, told CBN News. “And I think we all know this, but … there’s a revival spreading. There’s joy, there’s hope.”

The evangelist said the Anthem of Grace campaign centers, in part, on “Amazing Grace,” the “most sung and most translated hymn ever.” Beyond that, he said the campaign seeks to focus on the power of the Gospel to change hearts and minds.

“[It also focuses on the] story of every believer whose life has been changed by this and trying to tell the story of God’s grace in our lives, and welcoming people into that anthem of grace,” Hall said.

The faith leader said the mission of highlighting the change God has made in people’s lives and helping others discover the same transformation in their own journeys is the pinnacle of the campaign.

“It’s just incredible to see the hunger, and we’re really just trying to see a global movement of just pointing back to the grace of God,” Hall said. “And, hopefully, equipping as many believers as possible to share that story of how God’s changed them.”

Hall said he is humbled to see how God has used his ministry to reach so many hearts.

“This is amazing. … I’ve got three kids, I’m in a ministry now 20 plus years,” he said. “And I’m just incredibly humbled and incredibly thankful to still be following Jesus. I’m thankful to be more in love with Jesus than I’ve ever been.”

At the end of the year, Hall said he hopes “Anthem of Grace” helps light a fire in the hearts of people who have not yet encountered the Lord.

“In my heart and talking to so many believers … I just believe Jesus is coming soon … I just go to, you know, ‘How do we see as many people as possible hear the Gospel and know the Gospel?'”

Hall continued, “Because we know that … the Word promises things, right? The Word’s going to go to the ends of the Earth and then Christ is going to return.”

The preacher offered a reminder of what the Bible says about the end of days, noting how Jesus proclaims there will be “wars, and rumors and wars” and other happenings. Every generation since Christ has awaited His return, but Hall said world conditions right now make it feel more impending.

“It does seem like there’s a quickening around the world,” he said. “And I think what we’re seeing is that the dark is getting darker and the evil is getting greater. And, with that, the light is seeing brighter.”

Hall wants every person who claims to know Jesus to “testify to the goodness of God” — something he believes would immediately transform global circumstances.

“It would change the world overnight … just the testimony of the saints,” Hall said. “Even in Revelation, it says, ‘We’re going to overcome by the blood of the lamb and the word of their testimony.'”

Thus, he hopes people’s testimonies make a massive difference by proving the Gospel’s power and sway to a watching world.","Evangelist Nick Hall is in the midst of yet another monumental, year-long evangelism campaign — and he believes hearts and souls are being transformed.

Hengaw, an organization reporting on human rights violations against Kurds in Iran, stated there has been no reason given for the charges against the five Christians.

Listen to the latest episode of “Quick Start”

Hamid Afzali was sentenced to 10 years behind bars, followed by Nasrollah Mousavi, Bijan Gholizadeh, and Iman Salehi, each of whom were sentenced to five years, and Zohrab Shahbazi, who received a nine-month jail sentence, The Jerusalem Post reported.

In a statement to CBN News, Todd Nettleton, vice president of message for the Voice of the Martyrs, said, “The growth of the church in Iran is wonderful news for Christians around the world, and a great reminder of God’s ability to grow His church in spite of anything that any government might do to stop it.”

“But the high price our Iranian brothers and sisters are paying to follow Christ is a different kind of reminder: to pray often for them as they willingly suffer for the name of Christ,” he added.

The report from Hengaw noted that, while Christians are “acknowledged as a religious minority in Iran, authorities impose severe penalties, especially on those who convert from Islam to Christianity.”

Iran’s decision to imprison the five Christian converts violates article 18 of the United Nations’ International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, which states, “Everyone shall have the right to freedom of thought, conscience and religion. This right shall include freedom to have or to adopt a religion or belief of his choice, and freedom, either individually or in community with others and in public or private, to manifest his religion or belief in worship, observance, practice, and teaching.”

In addition to these five Christian arrests, Hengaw noted that another recent Christian convert in Iran, Yasin Mousavi, has been sentenced to 15 years in prison for charges including “membership in groups or associations aimed at disrupting security” and “propaganda against the government through promoting Christianity.”

OpenDoors.org, which tracks Christian persecution around the globe, has placed Iran at No. 9 on its World Watch List and rates the persecution Christians face in the Muslim-ruled country as “extreme.”

“For Christians who convert from Islam, not even the veneer of tolerance is present. Conversion from Islam to Christianity is illegal in Iran, and anyone caught as a convert can be arrested and imprisoned,” the organization explained in part. “The government views conversion as an attempt by the West to undermine Islam and the Islamic government of Iran. This means that anyone who is discovered to be a member of a house church can be charged with a crime against national security, which can lead to long prison sentences.”

Please be in prayer for our brothers and sisters in Christ facing persecution in Iran.","Five converts to Christianity have been sentenced by the Iranian judiciary to a collective of more than 25 years in prison, according to a report from Iran International.

Now, it's on a mission to build 40 more megachurches in the next 10 years.

Most roads in Hyderabad on Sundays lead to Calvary Temple. Shortly after 4 a.m., side streets around the church here are already jammed.

As church volunteers coordinate traffic, shuttle buses, auto rickshaws, and motorcycles ferry thousands of people, all trying to get here two hours ahead of Calvary's first of five services that begin at 6 a.m.

By sunrise, the faithful have taken their seats.

The main sanctuary holds 18,000 people supported by adjacent Bethlehem Hall with 15,000 and a third structure accommodating more than 3,000 more.

Hundreds more watch on television screens scattered around the sprawling Calvary campus.

Pastor Satish Kumar preaches all five services with the last one ending at 8 p.m.

""I've been given the grace to pastor this church which is beyond my dream and imagination,"" Pastor Kumar told CBN News.

Calvary Temple started in 2005 with about two dozen people. Today, it boasts more than 300,000 members making it one of the largest churches in the world.

They have 11 satellite churches with plans for more nationwide expansion.

""God put a burden in my heart to establish 40 mega churches just like what you see here during the next 10 years,"" said Kumar.

Pastor Kumar says the church adds some 3,000 new believers each month in a sign that the Lord is moving mightily across the country.

""God's hand is upon India, it's a time for India to reach the lost, not only within the country but across the globe,"" Kumar said.

In addition, the church produces over 650 TV programs each month in 17 of the country's major languages for broadcast on national television.

""It's not only within the nation, but also in Bangladesh, Nepal, Sri Lanka, Afghanistan, Pakistan and Gulf countries,"" said Kumar.

Millions more follow on social media. The reason for the church's success?

""Preaching the pure Word of God is what attracts people, and practicing the Word of God is what keeps people within the church,"" said Kumar.

That practical demonstration is on full display here each Sunday.

Narayana Podhili works as a civil engineer during the week. On Sunday, he leads an army of 150 church volunteers who spend hours chopping, slicing, peeling, and stirring – all to prepare free breakfast, lunch, and dinner meals for 50,000 people.

""We are committed to come here every Sunday at 3:30 a.m., 4 a.m., and we keep working till evening,"" Podhili told CBN News as he marshaled his forces.

Nagavalli Mendem has served in the Calvary kitchen for seven years after making a promise to God that if He healed her cancerous tumor, she would serve the church in this capacity.

""Because I made that promise, God healed me completely without surgery,"" Mendem said. ""God cleared the tumor in my chest and healed me. As a thanksgiving to Him, I serve here at the Lord's house.""

She and volunteers feed more than 200,000 people each month.

""In India, we say, 'service to mankind is service to God' so that is what we try to practice,"" Kumar said. ""We try to show God's love in action in every possible way that we find.""

Calvary also has an on-campus hospital where members get free medical treatment on Sundays and medicines at reduced cost.

""The majority of the people who come here are poor and cannot afford treatment,"" said Dr. Vinod Kumar of Calvary Hospital.

Members also have access to church facilities to hold marriages. And when a church member passes away, Calvary handles all funeral, burial, and meal arrangements – again, all for free.

In 2007, Calvary Temple created an access card system, the first of its kind, to follow up with members and their families.

""I have thousands of people. How do I know who hasn't shown up on a Sunday? As I was praying God put access card into my mind,"" Kumar said.

Each member must swipe their card when attending any one of the five Sunday services.

""Without fail, if we don't show up to church, we get a call,"" said Chandraiah, a Calvary Temple member. ""They'll ask me why I didn't come to church and after they find out they will pray for me. I'm happy when I receive that call. Not only that, but the fact also that they care for us is special, and because of that we will surely come to the next service.""

Pastor Kumar says prayer has always been an integral part of their success. The church has held 40 days of prayer and fasting regularly since 2005 drawing tens of thousands of young participants to stadiums around the country.

""During this 40 days of fasting and prayer, I teach from Genesis to Revelation,"" Kumar told CBN News. ""Every book I try to explain. Hundreds of thousands of young kids end up reading the whole Bible.""

Each month, the church, along with its satellite campuses, holds a ""Night with God"" as members pray for revival.

""About 25,000 to 30,000 people join. That has been the biggest, largest all-night prayer services in our nation,"" Kumar said.

In recent years, however, India has witnessed an unprecedented uptick in violence against Christians.

""The more the persecution, the more the church grows and that's what's happening in India,"" Kumar said.

Most attacks are carried out by Hindu extremist groups who accuse Christians of forcibly converting people to Christianity.

Pastor Kumar, a Hindu convert to Christianity himself, says resistance produces power.

""No persecution has ever succeeded in stopping the preaching of the Word of God, it always promoted the Word of God and spread the Word of God across the countries,"" said Kumar. ""It's my passion, my burden that before I die, I want to see every Indian will hear the gospel and know the Savior.""

Oklahoma's top education official ordered public schools Thursday to incorporate the Bible into lessons for grades five through 12.

State school superintendent Ryan Walters says his mandate is compulsory and “immediate and strict compliance is expected.”

He contends that since the Bible's influence on America and Western civilization has been prominent, it's important for students to be educated about its role in U.S. and world history.

""The Bible is an indispensable historical and cultural touchstone,"" Walters said in a statement. ""Without basic knowledge of it, Oklahoma students are unable to properly contextualize the foundation of our nation which is why Oklahoma educational standards provide for its instruction.""

Walters has previously noted that America is in a culture war and he doesn't want “woke ideology” spread by the state's public schools.



Left-wing groups have predictably threatened legal action calling the state school superintendent's move a violation of the U.S. Constitution.

“Public schools are not Sunday schools,” said Rachel Laser, president and CEO of Americans United for Separation of Church and State.

Oklahoma law explicitly allows Bibles in the classroom and lets teachers use them in instruction.

But earlier this week the Oklahoma Supreme Court blocked the state's attempt to launch the first publicly funded religious charter school in the U.S.

He went on to condemn the modern political left as “aggressively anti-common sense” during an interview with English journalist Tina Brown at the Aspen Ideas Festival in Colorado.

“Part of it the left has to own,” he told Brown. “They are aggressively anti-common sense. The Democrats keep running on this one idea, saying to the American people, ‘You can’t possibly think you can do worse than Donald Trump.’ And they keep saying, ‘Yes, we can. Yes, we can.'”

Maher went on to explain he has Democratic friends who have leftist children, many of whom, the comedian suggested, accuse their parents of “old thinking” and not understanding their progressive points of view.

“Tear down statues of Lincoln? Maybe give communism another shot? Get rid of the border patrol? Get rid of capitalism? White supremacy has never been worse? Gender is always just a social construct? It’s OK to have penises in the women’s swimming pool, in women’s prisons?” he said, listing a handful of the views held by leftists. “No, it’s not that I’m old; it’s that your ideas are stupid.”

Listen to the latest episode of “Quick Start”:

Maher explained to Brown that, if Democrats insist on embracing far-leftist ideals and refuse to collaborate in any way with Republicans who oppose Trump, they are only aiding the GOP in defeating incumbent President Joe Biden.

“That’s as good as it gets,” he said. “If you can’t talk to those people, you’re just abandoning the country to half the people who are even worse, who are going to vote for Trump this next time — and they are — and he very likely will win, and then what are we going to do?”

“I think we should keep the dialogue open,” the HBO’s “Real Time” host added.

Maher recently appeared on the ABC talk show “The View,” where he condemned those on the left who have chosen to vehemently oppose Israel and protest in support of Hamas.

“If I had any doubt that I was right about the change that’s happened in the left, watching people protest for a terrorist organization like Hamas — that straightened me out pretty quick,” he said, later adding, “It’s astounding to me that they can’t tell the good guys from the bad guys, just morally. If you’re for Hamas, just live in Gaza for a day … [even] before the war.”

Ultimately, he said the best way to stop Israel from retaliating is to “stop attacking Israel.”

In what's widely known as the Chevron case, the court took a step to curb the ability of the ballooning federal bureaucracy to bypass Congress with backdoor regulations.

In the other case, the high court issued a ruling about obstruction that could have a big impact on the future of President Trump and Capitol riot defendants.

The Chevron Case & the 'Deep State'



In a far-reaching decision, the Supreme Court upended the 40-year-old Chevron precedent that made it easier for federal government agencies to create their own rules on issues like the environment, public health, and business regulations.

The original Chevron decision allowed federal agencies to unilaterally fill in the details whenever government officials claimed the laws passed by Congress were too ambiguous.

Critics have argued for decades that only Congress has been given the power to legislate, so allowing bureaucrats broad power to invent thousands of regulations violates the U.S. Constitution. It's one of the reasons those critics have referred to the massive size of the federal government as the ""nanny state"" or even the ""deep state"" because unelected bureaucrats often seized that opportunity to operate autonomously from the legislative or judicial branches.

THE CHEVRON CASE David v Goliath: Small Businesses Fight Federal Bureaucracy at US Supreme Court

BREAKING: In a major blow to the unelected administrative state, the Supreme Court has overruled the Chevron doctrine, which required courts to defer to the legal interpretations of unelected bureaucrats.



“Chevron is overruled.” pic.twitter.com/tqC5EYaUBl — Sean Davis (@seanmdav) June 28, 2024

Chief Justice John Roberts wrote the court's opinion stating, ""Perhaps most fundamentally, Chevron's presumption is misguided because agencies have no special competence in resolving statutory ambiguities. Courts do.""

Tyler O'Neil, managing editor of the Daily Signal, wrote on X, ""This is a huge step forward for holding the administrative state—and the deep state—accountable.""

The Capitol Riot and Obstruction

In the other major case, the Supreme Court made it harder to charge Capitol riot defendants with obstruction, a charge that also has been brought against former President Donald Trump.

In a 6-3 ruling, the court ruled that charging someone with obstructing an official proceeding must include proof that defendants tried to tamper with or destroy documents. Only some of the people who breached the Capitol on Jan. 6, 2021, fall into that category, so many of those cases are expected to be affected by reduced sentencing.

Liberty Counsel Founder and Chairman Mat Staver said, ""This new narrow interpretation will make it difficult for these indictments to stand.""

Chief Justice John Roberts wrote Friday's decision, joined by Justices Samuel Alito, Neil Gorsuch, Brett Kavanaugh, and Clarence Thomas, and by Biden nominee Justice Ketanji Brown Jackson.

It's unclear how the court's decision might affect the obstruction case by Special Counsel Jack Smith against Trump in Washington. But the high court is expected to release a separate decision Monday regarding presidential immunity, and that ruling will directly impact Smith's case.

German-born Alexander Dietze learned about Germany’s history and the Holocaust in school, but it wasn't discussed at home. Raised in a secular household, he became a Christian in his early 20s.

Years later, an abrupt awakening came when his grandfather offered him Nazi SS medals as part of their family heritage. This moment spurred Alexander and his wife, Cäcilia, to found the ministry Back to Zion, dedicated to helping Holocaust survivors in Israel.

Each week, the Dietzes invite Holocaust survivors to their home, sharing their story, providing meals, singing Israeli songs in Hebrew, and gifting bouquets of flowers.

But the amount of firepower being assembled on Israel's northern border suggests that war could start any day now.

By the tens of thousands, Israeli troops continue gathering and preparing on that border with Lebanon. Their purpose is to stop Hezbollah terrorists who've been attacking northern Israel from Lebanon almost daily for months.

That's forced some 80,000 Israelis to flee their homes and empty out whole communities near the border. As Kiryat Shmona resident Yarden Haziza puts it, ""Living right now in Kiryat Shmona is very sad. The city is empty most of the time.""

Hezbollah hit the north with some 40 rockets on just Thursday alone. The terrorists say it was to avenge a number of recent Israeli air strikes on Hezbollah infrastructure and personnel.

'On the March to Conquer the Middle East'

As the war against Hamas grinds on in Gaza and tensions mount in the north, Israel's prime minister keeps trying to get the world to focus on the threat from Iran, the massive power behind both Hezbollah and Hamas. Benjamin Netanyahu insists Iran's jihadists have an evil goal.

He's warning Iran and its proxies are, as he put it, ""On the march to conquer the Middle East.""

Visiting the north this week, Israel's president complained the international community is doing little to stave off war. So Isaac Herzog said it shouldn't be surprised if, as he said, ""The situation spirals out of control.""

Exuberant Defiance of Terrorism

Even as Israel braces for what could be another massive and painful war, the Tribe of Nova came together in Tel Aviv Thursday in exuberant defiance of terrorism. They held their first mass concert since Hamas attacked their festival near Gaza on October 7th.

Nimrod Arnin's sister was among the more than 360 festival-goers killed there.

He told the concert crowd, “On that Saturday at the beginning of October, our light was put to the test - a test which in our worst nightmares we didn’t imagine we would have to pass. The ultimate darkness challenged the big light of the Tribe of Nova.""

The Thursday concert featured dozens of dancers on stage re-enacting the horror of that morning. And the crowd of tens of thousands all stood quiet in a long moment of silence commemorating all who were lost.

'We Will Dance Again!'

But the main message of the day wasn't at all somber. It was that Israelis will not let the terrorists steal away their lust for life, or their joy, or their dance.

As concert attendee Maxim Mileyev put it, ""Nothing can stop us from living our lives here in Israel. And nothing can stop us from keeping on dancing and living.”

Nimrod Arnin summed up what so many in the Tribe of Nova have come to know. He told the concert crowd, ""In a moment of enlightenment we realized what is going to be the essence of our life from now and on. We will dance again!""

The crowd cheered him...and danced for hours. They wanted to show that while Hamas worships death, Israelis embrace life...and life to the fullest.

Some are even calling for Biden to be replaced as the nominee.



Voters were also concerned by what they saw from the president as he struggled and stumbled throughout the evening.



Within the opening minutes, he flubbed a line saying, ""What I've been able to do with the Covid, excuse me, with, dealing with everything we have to do with, look, if we finally beat Medicare.""

Cognitive Concerns



It became clear to the former President's surrogates, that Biden was in trouble.

Rep. Elise Stefanik (R-NY) said, ""The Biden campaign said this would be the reset moment for Joe Biden's candidacy and what they saw, what the American people saw, was a weak, horrible president, who is the weakest president in our nation's history.""



Voter concerns about Biden's age and mental sharpness were on display during the 90-minute debate as the president struggled at times to answer questions.



Sen. Marco Rubio (R-FL) said, ""He repeated things that were not true and he also said things that, to be frank, there were times that I could not understand what he was saying.""



The showdown had Biden and Trump, the two oldest candidates to ever seek the White House, trading barbs on a number of topics.



On the Economy



""The only jobs he created are for illegal immigrants and bounce back jobs that bounce back from the Covid. He has not done a good job, he's done a poor job, and inflation is killing our country,"" Trump said.



On Abortion



""We are not for late-term abortion. Period. Period, period,"" Biden said.

Trump replied, ""Under Roe v Wade, you have late-term abortion. You can do whatever you want. Depending on the state, you can do whatever you want. We don't think that's a good thing. We think it's a radical thing. We think the Democrats are the radicals.""



On Immigration



Biden said, ""When he was president, he was taking separating babies from their mothers, put him in cages, making sure that the families were separated. That's not the way to go.""



Trump pushed back accusing Biden of putting in place weak border policies that make America unsafe.

""We have the largest number of terrorists coming into our country right now. All terrorists all over the world, not just in South America, all over the world. They come from the Middle East, everywhere, all over the world. That pouring in. And this guy just left it open.""

Biden's Poor Performance



The two also tackled wars in Ukraine and Gaza.



But by the end of the night, everyone was talking about President Biden's poor performance.

Michigan resident Rosanne Ponkowski said, ""I have dealt with people that have dementia before, and it's very obvious just from the look on his face, not understanding what's going on, the surprised and shocked look sometimes, the eyes, the very stiff face, the very stiff hands, they're all very prominent signs of what's going on.""

The White House tried to put a brave face on the evening telling reporters that Biden had a cold.



Surrogates like California Governor Gavin Newsom (D) attempted to side-step voter concerns that the president is too old.



CBN News directly asked Gov. Newsom, ""There's a lot of concern about the president's stamina and mental health. Are you concerned, 81 years old, are concerned about that going forward?"" Newsom replied, ""I'm worried about President Trump's stamina."" We followed up with, ""No, I'm talking about the president."" Newsom replied, ""No, I'm talking about President Trump as well.""



One top Biden donor reportedly called the president's performance disqualifying, telling Reuters that he expects Democrats will urge him to step aside ahead of the party's national convention in August.

Still, in a post-debate rally, Biden told supporters that he was confident he could win against Trump. ""Look, we're going to beat this guy. We need to beat this guy. And I need you in order to beat him. You're the people I've run for,"" Biden said.



Coming into the debate, Biden and Trump found themselves nearly tied in some national opinion polls. We'll see in the coming days whether this debate did anything to significantly change those dynamics. For now, though, the race is set to be decided here in Georgia and a handful of other key swing states like Wisconsin, Michigan, and Arizona. Meanwhile, voters there and across the country will get another look at the candidates on September 10th.","ATLANTA – Democrats are panicking over President Biden's shaky performance in last night's historic debate with former President Trump.

The hijab — the headscarf traditionally worn by many Middle East women — is becoming harder to spot in Iran these days.

For many Iranian women, the hijab has become a symbol of oppression. They're refusing to wear it, even under the threat of beatings and imprisonment.

Change is coming to the autocratic, saber-rattling Islamic Republic of Iran that Americans see on the news. And it's coming fast.

It's clearly visible on the streets of the capital Tehran in the wake of the mass protests that began in September 2022, following the death in police custody of Mahsa Amini, a 22-year-old woman who resisted wearing her hijab.

The raw emotion of the protests — including images of women publicly burning their hijabs — has evolved into a controlled expression of resoluteness and strength.

Explosive Yearning

The protests, known as the ""Women, Life, Freedom Movement"", burst the cork out of the bottle. The demonstrations, resulting in thousands of arrests and more than 500 deaths over several months, were an explosion of yearning for women's rights.

And the Iranian regime got the message loud and clear.

The protests cleared the fog and smoke between the demands of the people and the demands of the state. A clear line has been drawn. Both know what each other's demands are. The government has resumed its ""morality police"" project to force women to wear the hijab. But Iranian women are not backing off.

This movement continues to gather momentum.

Increasingly, Iranian men are showing broad support for women's rights and freedoms. They're recognizing core human rights that benefit the whole of society. This would have been unimaginable just a few years ago.

The change is not only social. It's religious, too.

Christians in Iran have long been subjected to persecution and even torture and death. Today, Iran has the third highest number of religious prisoners, with 347 citizens behind bars for their faith — and those are just ones we know about.

But most Iranians don't see Christians as ""the enemy"" anymore.

A generation ago, the idea of being an Iranian and a Christian was unthinkable, unforgivable even. Now it's accepted without a blink.

Yet the hardline regime still denies citizens the freedom to attend church or convert to Christianity. Officially, there isn't a single Farsi-speaking church in the entire nation of 90 million people.

Illegal house churches — believers secretly meeting in homes — are raided routinely by the police, their leaders interrogated and imprisoned.

A New Revolution

But new media platforms, including Zoom, Instagram, and WhatsApp, are revolutionizing church for Iran's ""isolated"" believers.

They're worshiping online in real-time with other isolated believers outside Iran in places such as Türkiye, building a sense of Christian unity in a region that's 97% non-Christian. Respected Iranian Bible teachers living in exile overseas teach and preach via Zoom and on-air via live broadcasts, encouraging and strengthening the underground church.

There's more to this new media revolution.

SAT-7, the multimedia ministry with which I serve in the Middle East, launched the first-ever Christian video-on-demand streaming service in the region, which is totally free to watch.

Social media, especially Instagram, allows us to connect directly with Iranians watching live programs on satellite television or on their phones and digital devices. Viewers, young and old, pepper us with questions about Jesus and Christianity.

A boy named Kaamran told us: ""The kids at school know I'm a Christian. They ask questions and I don't know how to answer. I pray for them. I really want the Lord's throne to be set up here in Iran.""

Change is coming to Iran. It's coming fast.

In fact, it's already here.

--- Reza Jafari, a native of Iran, is a presenter with Christian multimedia ministry SAT-7 based in the Middle East. He helped launch SAT-7's online Church for Kids in Iran and ""digital church"" for isolated believers who have no other way to attend church.","ANALYSIS: Change Is Coming to Iran, and It's Coming FastThe hijab — the headscarf traditionally worn by many Middle East women — is becoming harder to spot in Iran these days.

(AP Photo/Alex Brandon)

In one of the most eagerly anticipated opinions of this term, the U.S. Supreme Court has essentially decided to kick the can down the road on Idaho's abortion law.

The official release of the ruling comes a day after the decision was prematurely leaked by someone at the Supreme Court. It was published online briefly on Wednesday before being removed. A court spokeswoman said the post was a mistake.

The decision will allow emergency abortions for now in a procedural ruling that leaves key questions unanswered. For now, the Idaho case will continue to play out in lower courts, and could end up before the Supreme Court again.

Liberty Counsel Founder and Chairman Mat Staver explained, ""This order means that the case returns to the Ninth Circuit, which had ordered that the appeal of the preliminary injunction be decided by the full court on an expedited basis without any further briefing. The abortion ban currently remains in place in Idaho, except for those in emergency room situations.""

WATCH Our Analysis: Supreme Court Rules on Idaho Abortion Ban

What the Case Is Really About

The Biden administration had sued Idaho claiming the state's law violates a federal law called the Emergency Medical Treatment and Labor Act (EMTALA). The White House insists the EMTALA requires hospital emergency rooms to provide abortions to women if their general health is at risk. Idaho's law already provided an exception to save the life of the mother, so the case is seen as an effort to expand abortion access beyond that.

Idaho Solicitor General Joshua Turner suggested the Biden administration's ""health"" definition is too broad because it could be interpreted to include many non-life-threatening health concerns, including mental health.

And the Alliance Defending Freedom accused the Biden administration of trying to invent ""a federal abortion mandate by manipulating EMTALA.""

During the arguments at the court, Justice Samuel Alito said the EMTALA was not intended to include abortion because it specifically identifies unborn children as patients who should be cared for in emergency rooms.

""One potentially very important phrase in EMTALA,"" he said, ""is the reference to the woman's unborn child. Isn't that an odd phrase to put in a statute that imposes a mandate to perform abortions? Have you ever seen an abortion statute that uses the phrase, 'unborn child?'""

Alito pointed out, ""So in that situation, the hospital must stabilize the threat to the unborn child. And it seems like the plain meaning is that the hospital must try to eliminate any immediate threat to the child. Performing an abortion is antithetical to that duty.""

Abortion Leaks at the Supreme Court

Two years ago, Politico obtained a draft of the Dobbs ruling that overturned Roe v. Wade, stoking widespread outrage by pro-choice activists before the ruling was officially meant to be revealed. It fueled extremists who began firebombing and vandalizing pro-life pregnancy clinics and issuing death threats to the workers who try to help women facing unexpected pregnancies.

The Supreme Court never discovered who infamously leaked that Dobbs ruling, and now there is speculation about why this Idaho abortion ruling was also leaked.



Pro-life activist Kristan Hawkins posted on X, ""With media reporting on what appears to be a disappointing outcome in the EMTALA case, you have to wonder whether it's time for some people working on our nation's highest court need to be invited to find new jobs. Did the person who leaked the Dobbs decision 'accidentally' post today? Inquiring minds want to know.""","An pro-life protestor is seen on the ground after being pushed during a protest by abortion activists at the Supreme Court, June 24, 2024.

In order to survive, Mrs. Son and her mother escaped to China.



""We swam across the Tuman River for two days and bribed the North Korean soldiers and brokers in China. There we found a Christian church who helped us,"" Mrs. Son said.



After a few months, Chinese police began to trail them. Mrs. Son shared her harrowing experience.

""My mom noticed the police. She told me to jump out of the van when it stopped. I took off my clothes and shoes and gave to my mom because it was winter time and she needed to be warm. With only my underwear on, I jumped out of the van and 8 Chinese police chased me. I was already a Christian but not deep. But I knew it was God who protected me and instructed me to hide and hold onto the under bars of a truck. I got away but my mom was taken back to North Korea. I went back to try to find her only to find out that she suffered and died in prison because she did not deny her Christian faith.""



Mrs. Son eventually returned to China where she married a Chinese Christian. Several months later, she was re-captured though this time her husband gave her money to help her escape.



""Right before I was transferred to North Korea, I put all the money, the paper bills in plastic bags and swallowed them so that the soldiers will not see them. A week later, I got them all out. I used this to bribe the soldiers and brokers to go back to China.""



After yet another arrest, Mrs. Son spent 400 days in a North Korean prison under inhumane conditions where once again, she experienced God's help.



""The guard was my friend and he gave me rice. But it was the worse because I had to eat insects to survive. After 400 days, I was released… malnourished and could barely walk. This was when my husband used his Chinese citizenship to get me to South Korea,"" Mrs. Son recounted.



Once in South Korea, Mrs. Son joined the Seopyoung Church where she grew in her Christian faith. She realized how God saved her miraculously each time she was arrested.

The name of the church, ""Seopyoung"" stands for Seoul, the capital of South Korea and Pyongyang, the capital of North Korea. Most of its members are North Koreans whom they help settle in South Korea. The church envisions a unified North and South Korea by spreading the gospel in North Korea.



Rev. Chun Myeong Guen, head pastor of Seopyoung Church, said, ""It is impossible for North and South Korea to reunite politically because of different cultures and backgrounds. Therefore, reunification can only happen through faith because there will be no misunderstanding of each other. Only faith can make us reunite overnight.""

""During the starvation, many North Korean defectors escaped to China. Many believed Jesus, received Christian education in other countries and became missionaries in North Korea where there are now about 600,000 Christians in underground churches,"" he reports. ""Many Christians in South Korea who are praying for reunification believe it will happen in 5 years. It is like a ticking bomb.""



North Korean Christians like Mrs. Son can help make this happen.



""I want to thank my Mom and be like her. She gave her life for her Christian faith. I am also dedicating my life to serve Jesus Christ and spread the gospel and worship Him until I die,"" Mrs. Son said.","""We swam across the Tuman River for two days and bribed the North Korean soldiers and brokers in China.

Those are the words of Lex Renick, a female who formerly identified as a transgender male before she and her husband — who used to identify as homosexual — came to faith in Jesus.

Nic and Lex Renick got married on May 30, 2020, when both of them were living out their LGBT lifestyles. They have since turned away from their past decisions, with Lex restoring her female identity and returning to the name she was given at birth and Nic abandoning his homosexual identity.

Listen to the latest episode of “Quick Start”

The pair married one another as husband and husband but, since their respective salvation experiences, now identify as a heterosexual couple — husband and wife. They recently spoke with The Daily Wire’s Michael Knowles about their salvation experiences in a lengthy interview.

Knowles, a Catholic, described the couple’s testimony as “one of the wildest stories I’ve ever heard.”

In addition to restoring their live spiritually, Lex and Nic told Knowles they are seeing physical restoration. The two now share a healthy baby and, early on in their relationship, Lex underwent biopsies and was told she had cancerous cells in her body. But a doctor from Planned Parenthood recently told her, “This doesn’t make physical possible sense, but you no longer have any cancerous cells in your body.”

“I think it just goes to show that anyone can transform or turn into anything that they want,” said Nic of their experience together. “But nobody talks about transforming back to the original design that you’re supposed to be.”

He continued, “The world can tell you so much about who you’re ‘supposed to be’ based off of your interests or your personality type, and try to fit you into all of these crazy, outlandish boxes that might … make you feel included for a time.”

For her part, Lex opened up about the fact she believed the “lie” of the LGBT community.

“The whole world in the queer community was saying, ‘Well, you know if God made you then God made you this way,'” she recalled hearing. “[But] that argument doesn’t work with the trans community. Because, if we say, ‘God made me this way,’ then that means that I should have been a woman.”

Lex went on to explain to Knowles she found solace in the LGBT community because she was desperate for identity and belonging — something she had not previously found in her family or faith.

She grew up in an abusive household — one that claimed to be “Christian” — with a mother who struggled with alcoholism and even once told Lex, “If I would have known that you were going to be my child, I would have aborted you,” a comment her mother made after learning Lex struggled with her sexuality and gender identity.

Every time she tried to find comfort and safety in her family or in a church, Lex said they would “reject me.” Ultimately, she found the belonging she desired in the LGBT movement.

“I ran to this loving community, and that was the queer community, because they accepted me for me, not that I needed edifying or acceptance from the church,” she recalled. “I just needed a loving body of believers or family to wrap their arms around me and say, ‘Hey, we’re going to walk with you through this journey.’ But all I faced was rejection.”

Nic, on the other hand, began identifying as homosexual as a teenager but never faced the kind of isolation and rejection Lex experienced. His family, he said, “never tried to change me,” even though they took issue with his sexual identity, believing it contradicted God’s design for males and females.

“They didn’t condone or agree with what I was doing, and that is the exact Christian model of how I feel we should address the community,” he said. “We can’t shun or reject nor condone at the same time.”

Initially, as a transgender male — meaning biologically female — and a homosexual male, the couple wanted to have children, even when Lex was identifying as a man. But since their transformation, they have abandoned their former identities and now are true to their biological realities: a female and a male.

They currently share one child and just announced they are pregnant with their second baby.

The couple said they eventually found a church in Las Vegas where, even though its leaders didn’t condone their LGBT lifestyles, they welcomed them in as they were. It was there that they experienced true spiritual transformation.

“They chose to love us,” Lex said of the church they attended. “And that ministered to our hearts so much because we got to hang out with more believers and allow God to do the work on our hearts and then have friends in our lives to encourage us in the leading of the Lord rather than separating and kind of gatekeeping Jesus by taking people out of the church.”

In March, Lex and Nic renewed their wedding vows for the first time as husband and wife.

“I’m so in AWE of the Goodness of God,” Lex wrote in an Instagram post. “He is so so good! So many tears hearing my husband say, ‘I do,’ after Pastor Ivan said, ‘Do you take her to be your bride.’ Words, I never thought would be so sweet to hear deep within my soul. What an honor it is to be Nic’s bride. What an honor it is to serve God together and build His Kingdom.”

Now there's been a major revelation about how the Biden administration has pushed the transgender agenda when it comes to children.

According to the New York Times, Biden officials played a significant role in convincing an international pro-transgender medical group to remove age limits from its guidelines for trans surgeries.

""Email excerpts from members of the World Professional Association for Transgender Health (WPATH) recount how staff for Adm. Rachel Levine, assistant secretary for health at the Department of Health and Human Services and herself a transgender woman, urged them to drop the proposed limits from the group's guidelines and apparently succeeded,"" The Times reports.

The administration was reportedly concerned that age minimums would trigger political backlash that could fuel legislation opposing the trans ideology.

More than two dozen states now have laws restricting gender-altering medical experiments on the bodies of minors. And this week, the Supreme Court agreed to hear the Biden administration's challenge to one of those laws.

LATEST Supreme Court Takes up Hot Topic of Gender-Altering Procedures on Children

Critics say children are too young to make these irreversible, life-altering decisions while supporters claim that young people with gender dysphoria need the procedures right away.

But as CBN News reported earlier this year, U.S.-based think tank Environmental Progress reported that even the WPATH admitted behind closed doors that ""children and adolescents cannot comprehend the lifelong consequences of 'gender-affirming care,' and in some cases, due to poor health literacy, neither can their parents.""

MORE Leaked Files Reveal Major Risks with Transgender Experiments: 'It Is Not Medicine'

When we confronted WPATH about those claims, Marci Bowers, M.D., president of the group, told us in a statement, ""The world is not flat. Gender, like genitalia, is represented by diversity. The small percentage of the population that is trans or gender diverse deserves healthcare and will never be a threat to the global gender binary.""

Meanwhile, England and other European nations are backing away from transition procedures on minors after studies showed ""weak evidence"" that they lead to long-term positive impacts.

""This is one instance in which I think Europe is headed in the right direction,"" Sarah Parshall Perry of the Heritage Foundation told CBN's Wendy Griffith. ""In addition to that, we are now seeing Norway, Finland, Sweden, and now the most recent edition is Scotland who has backed off the use of chemical castration agents as well.""

There is also a growing number of people who regret undergoing gender transition and are seeking to revert back to their biological gender. They're warning distressed children and their families about rushing into life-altering medical decisions.

This debate is also the earliest in modern history, well ahead of the traditional fall schedule.

New rules aim to prevent chaotic scenes from past debates. There will be no live audience, no opening statements, and both candidates' microphones will be muted unless it's their turn to speak.

Performance on the debate stage might be the most crucial aspect for the 81-year-old Biden as Republicans highlight his age and mental health.

""Which Joe Biden's going to show up?"" asked House Speaker Mike Johnson. ""My summary is this: It doesn't matter if he drinks a whole gallon of energy drinks, he's not going to be able to match the acumen and the readiness of Donald Trump.""

Nathan Gonzales from Inside Elections tells CBN News that because some Republicans have portrayed Biden as too old and incompetent, the real challenge may lie with Donald Trump. ""Trump is used to feeding off the crowd and energy in the room, and that's just not going to be there,"" Gonzales explained. ""Trump is going to have to be disciplined when it comes to time and whether the mic is on or off. He must avoid being perceived as a bully.""

Biden is expected to focus on Trump's 34 felony convictions—a first for a presidential candidate—and other pending criminal cases. He will also likely address the abortion issue after the Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade, thanks to three Trump appointees. Trump, on the other hand, is expected to highlight issues such as the flood of unchecked migrants on the U.S. southern border and high inflation.

President Biden has been preparing for the debate at Camp David over the past several days. Former President Trump has been on the campaign trail, and Wednesday night, he attended a prayer conference call with members of a faith advisory board.

That news comes as top Israeli leaders visited the border with Lebanon where war could break out any day.

Aides to the prime minister have reportedly told the White House that when Netanyahu addresses a joint session of Congress in July, he'll present a new take on achieving a pathway to a Palestinian state. That would be a huge shift.

Yet those reports may be wrong. The Prime Minister's Office told The Times of Israel that Netanyahu ""opposes a Palestinian state and will not change his position in his address to Congress.""

The prime minister has consistently opposed Palestinian statehood in recent years, as poll after poll shows a huge majority of West Bank Palestinians themselves don't want a state next to Israel. They just want Israel destroyed.

Itamar Marcus, director of Palestinian Media Watch, points out most Palestinians hail the murderous attacks on Israelis, including what happened on October 7th.

""There's tremendous support within the West Bank for what happened on October 7th,"" Marcus stated. ""There was a poll taken a month and a half after October 7th – and everyone knew what happened, everybody knew about the rape and the destruction and the massacres – and Palestinians were asked 'With everything that's happened up till now, does it make you proud as a Palestinian?' And 98 percent of Palestinians said it made them proud.""

Preparing for War with Hezbollah & US Weapons Delays

On another front, both Netanyahu and Israeli President Isaac Herzog toured Israel's northern border with Lebanon this week. That's where all-out war may soon come, as the Jewish nation seeks to end daily attacks from Hezbollah on Israeli communities along the border.

In Washington, Israel's Defense Minister Yoav Gallant has supposedly made progress in speeding up shipments of weapons to the U.S. from Israel.

Netanyahu has accused the Biden administration of deliberately slow-walking such shipments.

For the first time, the U.S. administration is admitting there have been bottlenecks in getting some of those weapons shipped.

Gallant addressed Americans, saying Israel needs the U.S. by its side. ""The powerful and enduring bond between the United States and Israel is key to our nation's strategy and our security,"" the defense minister said.

Pennsylvania Sen. John Fetterman has been one Democrat particularly strong in supporting Israel's war with Hamas as others have wavered. He's met with Netanyahu on his first visit here. ""We stand with Israel through this and I'm so sorry for what's been done to this nation,"" Fetterman declared.

Turkey's President Recep Tayyip Erdogan pledged that his nation will stand with Hezbollah if it comes to war. He's condemning Western nations for backing Netanyahu, whose mental fitness he questioned. Erdogan asserted, ""It is extremely bad and pathetic that governments that talk about freedom, human rights, and justice are captives of a mentally ill person like Netanyahu.""

Antisemitism in NYC

In New York City, a masked man who demanded Jews get off a subway car earlier this month faces criminal charges of attempted coercion. He had yelled, ""Raise your hands if you're a Zionist – this is your chance to get out!""

Earlier this week, several dozen people protested against Manhattan District Attorney Alvin Bragg for his refusal to prosecute most of the anti-Israel demonstrators who illegally occupied Columbia University's Hamilton Hall this spring.

One protester said of Bragg, ""He's either a coward or an antisemite.""

Americans are being treated for health conditions such as heart disease, cancer, and depression to the tune of $43 trillion a year. One doctor believes up to 80 percent of these illnesses could be avoided by addressing what truly causes them.

After watching her beloved mother suffer from poor health for decades and then die relatively young, Casey Means pursued a career in medicine to help others avoid what happened to her mom.

""She had seen her doctors faithfully, taken all the medications, done exactly what they said, but the reality is she never healed,"" Dr. Means told CBN News.

Ditching Mainstream Medicine

After becoming a head and neck surgeon, Dr. Means became disillusioned with the entire process and walked away from mainstream medicine.

""What I saw in the health care system is that we're spending more money every single year on treating diseases, but patients in America aren't really getting better. Our rates of chronic illnesses are going up every single year,"" she said.

Dr. Means believes this is due to the system ignoring the root cause of many diseases, which she labels metabolic dysfunction.

""This leads to every imaginable chronic disease we're facing today from cancer to heart disease, stroke, Alzheimer's, dementia, type two diabetes, obesity, depression, anxiety, migraine, infertility, erectile dysfunction, you name it,"" Dr. Means said.

She explains in her book, Good Energy: The Surprising Connection Between Metabolism and Limitless Health, that metabolic dysfunction refers to how cells make energy, right down to the mitochondria.

Diet Matters Most

Dr. Means rates a proper diet as the best way to avoid metabolic dysfunction or reverse it. Other habits, like exercise and sleep, also play a role, but she says diet matters most. She believes if more doctors were to take ""an ultra-aggressive stance on diet"" with patients, many could avoid medications and surgery. However, with the current system in place, that's unlikely to happen.

""The average medical student in the United States does not take a single class in nutrition in medical school,"" Dr. Means said. ""Four years of medical school, three to seven years of residency, and we are not talking about nutrition or lifestyle virtually at all. So there's this huge mismatch between what's causing diseases and then what doctors are trained to understand and treat.""

After nine years, Dr. Means switched from surgery to functional medicine, one of the few specialties that emphasized healthy habits.

""It's a lot harder to counsel a patient for an hour on their lifestyle and their diet than send them with a prescription for a pill,"" Dr. Means said.

Avoid Processed Foods

Dr. Means says her top diet recommendation involves avoiding processed foods, which are found in packages and in many restaurants.

""Seventy percent of the calories we're eating in the United States today are ultra-processed foods made in factories,"" she said. ""Essentially we should think of ultra-processed food as a recent experiment in human culture that has failed. We know that ultra-processed foods drive diseases in children, in infants, in adults and the elderly.""

She advises people to eat food close to what's found in nature and ideally cooked at home.

""We've got to focus on the freshest, cleanest, unprocessed, whole foods as possible,"" she said.

Dr. Means recommends avoiding processed oils, such as soybean, vegetable, canola, shortening, peanut, safflower, and sunflower. She recommends consuming olive oil because it's rich in polyphenols, compounds that help protect against oxidative stress and inflammation. She also recommends avocado oil, and organic coconut oil.

As a child Hernandez was a migrant farm worker, toiling in fields in California alongside his Mexican parents and siblings. That hard labor fueled his big dreams of becoming an astronaut. And he never gave up on those dreams, even as NASA turned him down nearly a dozen times.

Now, his inspiring journey from rejection to acceptance has become a feature film called ""A Million Miles Away.""

Hernandez shared his inspiration to travel to outer space with CBN News' Studio 5.

""The stars always attracted me. When I was a kid, Star Trek, the first run series, was coming on, with Captain Kirk. Then when we would go out in the field, we would go away from the pollution of light of the city. It was still dark and man you can see constellations up above,"" he said.

""When I was a 10-year-old, I see on the black and white TV, the very last Apollo mission, Apollo 17, Gene Cernan, walking on the moon. That is when it hit me. I was like, 'I want to be like that guy. I want to go to outer space.' I told my dad, and my dad did something incredible. He only has a third-grade education, but he had the wisdom to empower me to believe it because he told me, 'I think you can do it.' As a 10-year-old, I never looked back. As I grew up, I just add perseverance,"" he continued.

Hernandez described his personal path to perseverance.

""I always tell people when you select something that you are going after, make sure you enjoy the journey because that is about 80 to 90% of your effort. So I was enjoying the journey,"" he told CBN News.

Faith also played a major role in Hernandez's life.



""A lot of people always argue with me and say, 'Isn't that a contradiction in life, science and religion?' and I say no. Quite the contrary. Science explains how things work. Religion explains why things happen. Not how things happen, but why they happen. And so it fills you spiritually as to why things happen. So, I think they go hand in hand,"" he told CBN News.

Many are now enjoying seeing his story on the big and small screens.

""It's kind of like I opened the door of my house to the public and they are all watching me now. I think it's good in the sense that I want people to see my story to understand where I came from that they get empowered to say that if he had it that bad and he was able to accomplish this, then why can't I accomplish my own goals,"" he said.

As a devoted father of five children, he is building a legacy they can model.

""My oldest four weeks ago, graduated from Purdue in Aerospace Engineering with a PhD. I asked him why Purdue. He said, 'Did you know that Purdue graduates the most Astronauts?' That's how he told me he wants to be an astronaut,"" he continued.

As Jose supports his son's space dreams, he's also back on the farm working alongside his dad in the vineyard their family owns.

""A Million Miles Away"" is streaming on the Amazon Prime platform.

Listen to the latest episode of “Quick Start”

The baptisms were part of an event series known as PNG for Christ, with initial estimates apparently accounting for only a portion of the total baptisms that took place, Adventist Today reported.

The outlet went on to say the PNG for Christ campaign is a joint Seventh-day Adventist effort of the Papua New Guinea Union Mission (PNGUM), the General Conference, and Adventist World Radio, among others.

The effort was reportedly a two-week campaign tour featuring Pastor Ted Wilson, president of the Seventh-day Adventist world church. He and his wife, Nancy, spoke at daily events as the crusade traveled around Papua New Guinea to share the Gospel.

Wilson released a May 19 statement on Facebook detailing some of the incredible baptism numbers that reportedly took place during these events.

“The latest information from the South Pacific Division and the Papua New Guinea Union Mission is that 278,369 people have been baptized so far in ‘PNG for Christ’ with only about 52% of the over 2000 sites reporting,” he wrote. “This is a miracle of God! Many more will be reported.”

He followed up that announcement a week later, revealing that more than 300,000 had been baptized as reports continued to come in from around the country.

Wilson said the PNG effort carefully instructed people in biblical truth to help them understand the Gospel. He went on to say the baptisms were evidence of the “Holy Spirit power being poured out on Papua New Guinea.”

Just days before Wilson’s post, Adventist Record stated in a May 14 article that, with official numbers still being counted, the total baptismal count was already at 260,000.

With so many being immersed, some pools had to be made to accommodate up to 1,000 people — an incredible feat that shows the depths of new believers’ desire to express their faith.

The impact of PNG for Christ on individual hearts was apparently sweeping, with the Adventist Record noting reports of “drug lords burning their marijuana crops and being baptised, prisoners responding to calls, whole villages declaring themselves Adventist, healings and people understanding the Gospel presentations in their own languages.”

PNG for Christ was coordinated by Pastor Miller Kuso, personal ministry director for PNGUM. He oversaw 2,000 sites where events were held throughout the country, including in some remote areas.

“It is a great privilege and honor for me to visit different sites right across our country,” he told the Adventist Record. “I would like to thank [the almost 300 international speakers] for standing together, as a movement, with PNGUM to deliver the message of hope, the message of salvation to the people of this great nation of Papua New Guinea.”

Be sure to pray for the hundreds of thousands who were reportedly baptized during PNG for Christ and for the many leaders helping disciple people who are leaving behind other religious and faith systems to begin new and vibrant relationships with Christ.

CBN News has reached out to the Seventh-day Adventist world church to confirm final baptism numbers and will update the story when we hear back.

The Department of Homeland Security is searching for hundreds of ISIS-related ""subjects of concern"" who crossed the southern U.S. border illegally.

The DHS says more than 400 migrants came into the U.S. from Central Asia through a smuggling network affiliated with the Islamic terrorist group referred to as ISIS. Only about 150 have been arrested while others are reportedly being tracked across 17 states.

However, the whereabouts of more than 50 of those suspects are unknown.

Most of the ISIS-connected individuals who crossed the border were allowed to stay because they were not on a terrorism watch list, according to NBC News.

House Committee on Homeland Security Chairman Mark E. Green, MD (R-TN) recently released a statement saying, ""Almost weekly we are getting reports that someone with terrorist ties or other major criminal connections has been released into our country by the Biden administration and allowed to roam free for months or even years.""

""It's only a matter of time before one of these individuals connected to a terrorist group is involved in something devastating on U.S. soil, and this administration will be responsible. How much longer will we let this madness continue?"" Green asked.

Recent attacks in Russia, such as this weekend's assault on churches and synagogues in the republic of Dagestan, have raised concerns about the terror group ISIS and its offshoots spreading abroad.

Earlier this month, federal agents revealed they had arrested eight people in several U.S. cities with alleged ties to ISIS.

Federal agencies released a joint statement saying, ""The individuals arrested are detained in ICE custody pending removal proceedings … The FBI and DHS will continue working around the clock with our partners to identify, investigate, and disrupt potential threats to national security.""

Lead Pastor Cole Bailey reflects on those challenging days with gratitude for CBN's Operation Blessing, praising it as a powerful, life-changing force for good.



Scars from Hurricane Michael are still visible in Panama City Beach. Where the former Lighthouse Church building once stood, now there's just a mere concrete slab that once supported a thriving congregation.



""When you're in Florida, a Category 3 hurricane might not worry you – but when it escalated to a five, we knew it was serious and we evacuated,"" said Pastor Bailey.



The first Category 5 storm to strike Florida's Panhandle, Michael became the most powerful hurricane to make landfall in the U.S. It claimed 59 lives and caused an estimated $25 billion in damage.



After 24 years of serving this community, Lighthouse Church lost its entire physical site to Hurricane Michael except for the ground it once stood on. The church's foundation in faith, however, remained unshaken.

Pastor Cole Bailey, an Air Force veteran, brought his military experience to bear when Hurricane Michael devastated Panama City Beach. As pastor of Lighthouse Church, his leadership was instrumental in organizing the community and coordinating relief efforts. He vividly recounted the pivotal moment when a helicopter from CBN's Operation Blessing landed at their ravaged property, bringing much-needed aid and volunteers to help restore hope and order.



""I get a call from someone from Operation Blessing and they said, 'We're looking for a church to partner with, someone in the area where we can come in, we can set up operations and begin to do what we do,'"" Pastor Bailey recounted. ""And I said, 'I'm your guy, I'm your guy.' And they said, 'Okay, can we land a helicopter in your parking lot?' And I was like, 'Come on, bring that helicopter here!' And I start telling everybody else like, 'Okay, Operation Blessing from CBN, they're bringing a chopper in, y'all, right now. They're on their way in.' And whenever that helicopter landed, we met a man named Tom. Tom got off that chopper, man. He shook my hand, and we walked around, and he said, 'Can we set up here?' And I'm like, 'Our place is your place. Do anything you want to do. I mean, we're so, so thankful that you're here.' And they came in and just brought peace to chaos.""



Volunteers brought chainsaws, hot meals, and a spirit of perseverance. Pastor Bailey saw it as the power of faith in action.

""They came in with resources that blew our minds,"" said Bailey. ""They came in with hundreds of volunteers just at one location. We were able to serve 38,000 hot meals after that storm. Resources are coming in, equipment is coming.""

Stephanie Robinson has been a part of Lighthouse since it started in 2000.

""I knew God was going to move, but it's hard to see in that, you know, that devastating time of just everything that God had kind of built, just plummeting,"" said Robinson. ""But it was amazing to watch the community of God just immediately step in.""

Despite the storm, Stephanie says the church found its true strength in the faith of its people. Today, the new building stands in a renovated movie theater across the bridge in Panama City.

""And it's a beautiful picture of God taking the destruction and bringing something out of the ashes really, and truly just exploding here,"" said Robinson.

Pastor Bailey mentioned the church is experiencing significant growth, with multiple services each week, and they currently do not have enough chairs to accommodate everyone attending. He highlighted that they have 1,300 people participating in small groups weekly.

""But this church right here is so thankful for when Operation Blessing landed on our property and helped us through the hardest time of our lives,"" said Pastor Bailey. ""I cannot express how life-changing and how powerful that ministry is.""

Less than five months from the presidential election, state officials are busy preparing for the voting process. According to one survey, a vast majority have increased security since 2020, hoping to ensure results can be trusted.

The Pentagon is reaching out to higher education for help, enlisting research teams from two Maryland universities. Their task: a three-year risk assessment focused specifically on the vulnerabilities of voting machines.

""We are looking at all the things that could possibly go wrong. Those could be an actor trying to disrupt something, maybe...trying to break a machine or trying to back vote for somebody who's dead, or things like that. But they could also be honest mistakes,"" Dr. Natalie Scala of Towson University told CBN News.

Scala, the co-director of the Empowering Secure Elections Lab at Towson, says this is the perfect assignment for academia, rather than government officials to tackle.

""For academics, we look at it based purely on data,"" Scala explained. ""So we don't necessarily have a favorite candidate. We don't necessarily have an agenda to push. We just want that vote to stay the way it is, from the moment somebody casts it to the moment we count it, we want nothing to happen there. And what can we do to make sure that that happens, that that integrity stays there, so the American people can have their votes counted.""

The project's focus involves optical scanners, used by 70 percent of voters, and ballot marking devices, used by the remaining 30 percent.

""We are looking at it from the, you know, America like the average American standpoint and making sure that you feel confident and secure in the processes that we have,"" Scala said.

In the past, her lab provided training for Maryland poll workers, a project she says will add to their current research.

""We don't want poll workers to make honest mistakes, and those mistakes become risks, you know, or problems. And we also want poll workers to be able to identify if something is going wrong,"" Scala said.

This is the first of the lab's three-year Pentagon grant. The team will consider cyber, physical, and insider threats. An overall approach, that will hopefully result in protecting other critical infrastructure, like the power grid.

The presumptive Republican presidential nominee told a crowd gathered in Philadelphia Saturday he is denying the Rev. Franklin Graham’s suggestion he avoid using course language during his speeches, essentially because it makes his addresses less interesting.

In a clip shared on X, Trump praised Graham as a “man I like” and described him as someone he admires before recalling a letter the evangelist — the son of the late Billy Graham — wrote, in which he asked the brash politician to stop using “foul language” on his campaign stops.

“He said, ‘President, I love your speaking. Your ability to speak is incredible. Your storytelling is great, but it could be so much better if you didn’t use foul language,'” Trump recalled of the note from Graham, before responding to his request, saying, “He’s wrong.”

While Trump claimed he has been working “so hard” to avoid course language during his speeches, he said the lengths of his monologues — which often run between one and two hours — make it very difficult for him to completely eliminate swearing from his vocabulary.

He requested Graham allow him “one or two” curse words, because “if you don’t, you don’t get the emphasis.”

Listen to the latest episode of “Quick Start”

To show he has made a good-faith effort, the former president noted a recent speech he delivered over the weekend at the Faith and Freedom Coalition’s Road to Majority Conference, a gathering of Christian political activists in Washington, D.C.

Trump said, “I was really good. I didn’t interject. Could have been better if I used a couple of bad words.”

The likely Republican presidential nominee, though, did acknowledge one scenario in which he would stop using bad words altogether: “When I see people start to walk out, then we’ll stop.”

“I’m not going to use the word bull****,” Trump stated, saying the full curse word without censoring himself, going on to claim it’s “not that bad a word.”

As for Graham, he told The Wall Street Journal earlier this year he does not officially endorse political candidates. The evangelist has nonetheless become a stalwart supporter of the former president.

In 2021, for example, 10 Republican lawmakers sided with Democrats in the U.S. House of Representatives in voting to impeach Trump over the rioting inside the U.S. Capitol. Graham compared those GOP legislators to Judas Iscariot, the wayward disciple who betrayed Jesus to the Roman authorities for 30 pieces of silver — a sinful decision that set into motion Jesus’ crucifixion.

“These ten, from [Trump’s] own party, joined in the feeding frenzy,” Graham wrote in a Facebook post at the time. “It makes you wonder what the thirty pieces of silver were that Speaker [Nancy] Pelosi promised for this betrayal.”

News of the language-based request from Graham comes as the Samaritan’s Purse and Billy Graham Evangelistic Association president launched a new fund for Christians facing religious liberty challenges in the United Kingdom.

“There are so many problems in our society, and people are looking for hope,” he said in a statement shared with CBN News. “We know that true hope can only be found in Jesus Christ, so we need to support one another in getting the Good News of Jesus Christ out — whatever it takes.”

CBN,https://www1.cbn.com/cbnnews/israel/2024/june/us-warns-hezbollah-but-pushes-for-diplomatic-solution-ultra-orthodox-draft-order-threatens-netanyahu-govt,2024-06-26,10:02:22 UTC,US Warns Hezbollah but Pushes for Diplomatic Solution; Ultra-Orthodox Draft Order Threatens Netanyahu Gov't,"JERUSALEM, Israel – Israel is facing rising pressures from outside and within today. As the Jewish state is simply looking to protect its people from daily rocket attacks, the U.S. is pushing for a diplomatic solution to the fighting between Lebanon-based Hezbollah and Israel before it turns into a full-blown war. Meanwhile, Israel's Supreme Court ruling Tuesday concerning the drafting of ultra-Orthodox men could also pose problems for Netanyahu's government.

U.S. Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin warned Hezbollah that Washington can't stop Israel from going to war to prevent the terror group's daily attacks on the north.

""Hezbollah's provocations threaten to drag the Israeli and Lebanese people into a war that they do not want,"" Austin said Tuesday. ""And such a war would be a catastrophe for Lebanon, and it would be devastating for innocent Israeli and Lebanese civilians.""

Still, Austin is urging Israel's visiting Defense Minister Yoav Gallant to seek a diplomatic solution.

""Another war between Israel and Hezbollah could easily become a regional war, with terrible consequences for the Middle East. And so, diplomacy is by far the best way to prevent more escalation,"" Austin stated.

Yoav Gallant says Israel is determined to establish security in the north and bring back some 80,000 citizens evacuated from their homes. He asked the U.S. to focus on heading off a larger threat: Iran getting nuclear weapons.

""The greatest threat to the future of the world and the future of our region is Iran. And time is running out,"" Gallant insisted.

In Israel itself, the Supreme Court ruled that ultra-Orthodox young men must now serve in the military. The community, which has 65,000 young men, has been exempt from the military draft since 1948 when Israel's first prime minister allowed 400 students to study full-time as a spiritual blessing to the state.

Former Knesset Member Dov Lipman, now the CEO of a group that helps immigrants, noted the exemption for the ultra-Orthodox posed a problem for secular Israelis. ""And broader Israel said that there needs to be equality,"" he told CBN News. How can there be tens of thousands who are being exempted from military service when everyone else is serving? Lipman explained the coalition partners with Netanyahu's Likud Party are ultra-Orthodox, and they don't want their people drafted. ""The Supreme Court ruling is (that) everyone gets drafted until you cover the law that shows equality. Everyone gets drafted. There's no way these ultra-Orthodox parties can stay in a government where that's the government policy – and that could collapse the government and lead to a new election,"" Lipman said.

And in a New York political campaign where Israel was a point of contention, Congressman Jamaal Bowman, a member of the Progressive “Squad” lost his primary race this week to moderate Democrat George Latimer. Bowman’s opposition to Israel was a key issue in the first loss for the Squad since it was formed 6 years ago.

Calling himself 'Eric,' he was an agent for China's Ministry of Public Security or 'First Bureau,' from 2008 until last year, when he defected to Australia.

He told CBN News, ""My job was to collect intelligence about the country I was in and the anti-communist groups there. I was supposed to infiltrate these groups, make friends, and trap targets for return to China.""

Eric was coerced into becoming an agent in 2008 after his arrest for supporting a pro-democracy party and given a choice: help the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) catch dissidents abroad or go to jail. He chose the former, taking on fake identities, such as a property executive and an anti-communist freedom fighter, to lure dissidents to countries where they could be abducted and returned to China.

But because he secretly protected targets and says no one was arrested because of his work, his handlers became suspicious, and he decided to defect.

""I did not want to be responsible for any targets being returned to China and tried to make sure that did not happen, and this made my bosses suspicious of me,"" Eric said.

Eric's testimony confirms our reporting and the reports of others that a Chinese government spy network is threatening, entrapping, and even kidnapping critics of the Chinese communist government.

""These are kind of the methods being used by the CCP. This is not an allegation we're making. This is what their official documents state,"" says Laura Harth, who tracks Chinese transnational repression for the human rights group Safeguard Defenders.

CCP Agents like Eric are known to operate in the U.S., but Harth says these agents are only one part of a larger campaign by the Chinese government, called ""The United Front.""



""The United Front is something that's being defined by the Chinese Communist Party as one of its 'secret' or 'magic' weapons. And essentially its task is two things: On the one hand, expand the circle of friends of the Chinese Communist Party. So, co-opting or influencing, politicians, media, academia, and entrepreneurs. But on the other hand, its task is also to crack down on critics, to silence them, to divide them.""

An Amnesty International survey of Chinese students in 24 universities in Europe and North America found that many live in fear of surveillance, harassment, or intimidation by Chinese agents.

Dissidents sent us photos of Chinese police paying visits to their relatives and warning them they face trouble and even jail if their family member doesn't stop criticizing the Chinese government.



It's unclear how many of the so-called Chinese police stations used to control dissidents are still operating in the U.S. On paper, it might be less than five. The one we reported about above a noodle shop in New York City was finally shut down by authorities.

Harth says, ""It's important to recognize that police stations or so-called police stations is really the tip of the iceberg. It's much more widespread than one, two or three single stations. We need to take a broad view and understand what the wider picture looks like and the amount of proxies and networks that the Chinese Party-state is operating.""



Bob Fu, founder and president of the Texas-based ministry China Aid helped lead the 1989 Tiananmen Square protests as a student. He still faces harassment by Chinese agents, 35 years later.



Fu told CBN News, ""In recent months, even I have been harassed and receiving threats, text messages and also CCP agents booked hotels under my name and then called the police, from New York to Los Angeles, from Washington, D.C. to Houston, basically for bomb threats, and said 'Bob Fu was about to set off bombs.'""

MUST SEE 'The Perfect Police State': China's Digital Dictatorship Goes Global



Pro-democracy activist Lijian Jie in Los Angeles, who Chinese agents have tried to kill three times, told us Chinese-Americans are ""still surrounded by constant threats of danger.""



In a special message to his former colleagues still trying to harass and trap Chinese dissidents, Eric encouraged them to ""recognize the nature of the communist party,"" that ""it is a fascist totalitarian party,"" and that ""carrying out these illegal and secret activities in various countries is not good for you."" He challenges them to instead ""do something good for human civilization.""

Fortune,https://fortune.com/2024/06/30/home-price-trend-new-vs-existing-homes-housing-market-outlook/,2024-06-30,17:35:08 UTC,This decades-long trend in home prices has been ‘flipped on its head’ amid a big shift in the housing market,"The historically unaffordable housing market has been forcing builders to start making smaller homes, and that has now triggered a major milestone in prices.

Since the mid-1980s, new homes typically commanded a price premium over existing homes, Howard Hughes Holdings CEO David O’Reilly told CNBC on Wednesday, adding that it has been shrinking over the past several months. Now it’s gone.

“Today’s result said that that’s actually flipped on its head,” he said.

For the month of May, the median sales for a new home price fell 0.9% from a year earlier to $417,400, the Commerce Department said on Wednesday.

By contrast, the median sales price for an existing home jumped 5.8% from a year ago to a fresh record-high of $419,300 in May, the National Association of Realtors said earlier this month. The NAR said that reflected more sales of high-priced properties as well as multiple offers.

And since the start of the year, the price of existing homes has been even steeper, jumping 10.8% from $378,600 in January. For new homes, it was $430,400 in January.

That’s as the housing market’s lock-in effect has kept the supply of existing homes tight because homeowners with low mortgage rates are reluctant to give them up and are not selling. But demand has stayed elevated, adding upward pressure on prices.

Meanwhile, the latest quarterly reports from homebuilders showed that average selling prices are coming down, O’Reilly said, citing a shift in the product mix.

“That shows the consumer adjusting to a smaller home, taking less space and trying to get back into that range of affordability,” he said.

O’Reilly, whose heads real estate development and management company also works with builders, has been bullish on the sector, declaring in April that this is the “golden age of homebuilding.”

The reversal in home prices for new homes versus existing homes also comes as the $200,000 starter home is going extinct, making it tougher for first-time buyers to get into the housing market.

“Over the past several years, the number of homes under $200,000 has gone from around half of all sales to less than a quarter of sales in 2023,” Realtor.com said in a report earlier this month, calling the statistic, “stark proof of shrinking affordability across the country.”","The historically unaffordable housing market has been forcing builders to start making smaller homes, and that has now triggered a major milestone in prices.

Meanwhile, the latest quarterly reports from homebuilders showed that average selling prices are coming down, O’Reilly said, citing a shift in the product mix.","['big', 'month', 'market', 'flipped', 'shift', 'price', 'prices', 'homes', 'decadeslong', 'amid', 'housing', 'sales', 'shrinking', 'head', 'earlier', 'smaller', 'start', 'existing', 'trend']","https://fortune.com/img-assets/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/GettyImages-1697179196-e1719764642210.jpg?resize=1200,600",,fml lah,histor unafford hous market forc builder start make smaller home trigger major mileston price sinc mid new home typic command price premium exist home howard hugh hold ceo david o'reilli told wednesday ad shrink past sever month it 's gone `` today 's result said that 's actual flip head '' said month may median sale new home price fell year earlier commerc depart said wednesday contrast median sale price exist home jump year ago fresh recordhigh may nation associ realtor said earlier month nar said reflect sale highpric properti well multipl offer sinc start year price exist home even steeper jump januari new home januari that 's hous market 's lockin effect kept suppli exist home tight homeown low mortgag rate reluct give sell demand stay elev ad upward pressur price meanwhil latest quarter report homebuild show averag sell price come down o'reilli said cite shift product mix `` that show consum adjust smaller home take less space tri get back rang afford '' said o'reilli whose head real estat develop manag compani also work builder bullish sector declar april `` golden age homebuild '' revers home price new home versus exist home also come starter home go extinct make tougher firsttim buyer get hous market `` over past sever year number home gone around half sale less quarter sale `` realtorcom said report earlier month call statist `` stark proof shrink afford across countri ''
Fortune,https://fortune.com/2024/06/30/indebted-countries-warning-bank-of-international-settlements-government-bond-markets/,2024-06-30,15:44:19 UTC,"Heavily indebted countries can look just fine until suddenly they don’t, finance watchdog warns—’That is how markets work’","Indebted countries are vulnerable to a precipitous loss of confidence even though that risk is barely acknowledged in bond markets, the Bank for International Settlements warned.

The Basel-based institution said in its annual economic report released on Sunday that countries whose bloated fiscal positions are further stretched by higher interest rates should prioritize fiscal repair. Claudio Borio, head of the BIS’s monetary and economic department, said they must act “with urgency.”

“We know from experience that things look sustainable until suddenly they no longer do,” he told reporters. “That is how markets work.”

While the need to fix public finances has been a recurring theme for the BIS, the remarks coincide with heightened scrutiny on indebted economies. Worries about France this month prompted investors to demand the highest premium on its bonds since 2012.

The Basel officials didn’t specify any country in particular, but they did feature a chart looking at the debt and market pricing of some of the world’s biggest borrowers, including Japan, Italy, the US, France, Spain and the UK.

In order to stabilize finances, advanced economies can this year run deficits no larger than 1% of gross domestic product, down from 1.6% last year, the BIS said. That’s a fraction of the current US deficit, which the International Monetary Fund described last week as “much too large.”

“Though financial market pricing points to only a small likelihood of public finance stress at present, confidence could quickly crumble if economic momentum weakens and an urgent need for public spending arises on both structural and cyclical fronts,” the BIS said. “Government bond markets would be hit first, but the strains could spread more broadly.”

Inflation is subsiding however, BIS officials acknowledge. The world is currently set for a “smooth landing,” General Manager Agustin Carstens said.

Services still pose a risk to that outlook, with prices in that area out of step with pre-pandemic trends, the report said. In addition, increases in the cost of commodities due to geopolitical tensions could reignite inflation.

Given these pressure points, officials highlighted that central banks should be cautious about cutting rates too soon. That could prove costly to their reputations if such policy needs to be reversed amid a flare-up of inflation again, the report said.

Policymakers already did their fair share to contribute to that problem, the BIS suggested, repeating its accusation that “with the benefit of hindsight,” pandemic-era stimulus probably raised the risks of second-round effects.

While central banks shouldn’t ease too soon, governments also have a part to play with too-loose fiscal policy, officials said. Instead, they should widen tax bases and deliver structural reforms to meet future challenges including demographic shifts and climate change.

“Our main message is that central banks alone cannot deliver a durable increase in economic growth and prosperity,” Borio said. “Laying the foundation for a brighter economic future also requires actions from other policymakers, especially governments.”","The Basel-based institution said in its annual economic report released on Sunday that countries whose bloated fiscal positions are further stretched by higher interest rates should prioritize fiscal repair.

Fortune,https://fortune.com/2024/06/30/superyachts-scientists-ocean-research-climate-change-environment-noaa-fleet/,2024-06-30,15:21:53 UTC,Superyachts aren't just for the super-rich: Hundreds of scientists use them,"For almost two years, Robert Brewin collected data from the bow of a superyacht as it sailed pristine waters from the Caribbean Sea to the Antarctic Ocean.

The Archimedes, a 222-foot (68-meter) “adventure” yacht then owned by the late hedge funder James Simons, boasts a gym, a jacuzzi and an elevator. But between 2018 and 2020, Brewin was concerned only with the boat’s Sea-Bird Scientific Solar Tracking Aiming System, installed to measure light reflecting off of the water. A senior lecturer at the UK’s University of Exeter, Brewin and his colleagues were analyzing microplankton — microscopic organisms at the base of the marine food chain — by studying the ocean’s color. The Sea-Bird’s readouts helped them verify satellite imagery.

Brewin’s was not your typical superyacht itinerary, but he is one of hundreds of scientists to have used an adventure yacht — also known as expedition or explorer yachts — to conduct research on the ocean. In a paper published in January, Brewin and his co-authors touted the potential of “harnessing superyachts” for science, concluding that “reaching out to wealthy citizen scientists may help fill [research capability] gaps.”

It’s a view shared — and being pushed — by the Yacht Club of Monaco and the Explorers Club, a New York City-based organization focused on exploration and science (of which, full disclosure, I am a member). In March, the groups co-hosted an environmental symposium that included an awards ceremony for yacht owners who “stand out for their commitment to protecting the marine environment.” The Archimedes won a “Science & Discovery” award.

“If a yacht is operating 365 days a year, rather than having it sit idle it’d be much better for it to contribute a positive return through science and conservation,” says Rob McCallum, an Explorers Club fellow and founder of US-based EYOS Expeditions, which runs adventure yacht voyages.

EYOS charters yachts from private owners for its excursions, and is a founding member of Yachts for Science, a four-year-old organization that matches privately owned yachts with scientists who need time at sea. (Other members include yacht builder Arksen, media firm BOAT International, and nonprofits Nekton Foundation and Ocean Family Foundation.) Yachts for Science will enable about $1 million worth of donated yacht time this year, McCallum says, a figure he expects to hit $15 million by 2029.

“There’s a personal satisfaction that we are contributing to something that is bigger than us,” says Tom Peterson, who co-owns an insurance underwriting company in California and has what he jokingly refers to as a “mini superyacht.” Every year for the past decade, Peterson has donated about 15 to 20 days of time and fuel on the 24-meter Valkyrie to scientists, who he takes out himself as a licensed captain and former scuba dive operator. He often works with the Shark Lab at California State University Long Beach, and allows researchers to stay aboard for days at a time instead of having to constantly make the 1.5-hour trip to and from shore.

To link up with scientists, Peterson works with the International SeaKeepers Society, a Florida-based nonprofit that engages the yachting community to support ocean conservation and research. “The more we understand things about the ocean in general, the better we all are in the long run,” he says.

When “superyacht” and “the environment” appear in the same sentence, it’s usually in a different context. In 2019, one study estimated that a single 71-meter superyacht has the same annual carbon footprint as about 200 cars. In 2021, another paper found that superyachts were the single greatest contributor to the carbon footprint of 20 of the world’s most prominent billionaires, accounting for 64% of their combined emissions.

“If you really want to respect the environment, you can just go surf,” says Grégory Salle, a senior researcher at the French National Centre for Scientific Research and author of the book Superyachts: Luxury, Tranquility and Ecocide. Salle is open to the idea that superyachts could be used to advance scientific research, but says it’s contradictory for anyone to buy a superyacht and claim to be truly concerned about the environment.

McCallum says people who own adventure yachts tend to be younger than your standard superyacht owner, and have a particular interest in remote and pristine places. “They’re not the sort of people that are content to just hang out in the Mediterranean or the Caribbean,” he says. “Antarctica, the Arctic, the remote Indian Ocean, the remote Pacific Ocean, the Subantarctic islands… that’s where you’re going to find us delivering our services.”

Explorer yachts aren’t the only way scientists can reach those destinations, but demand for dedicated research vessels does outstrip available supply. The US National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), arguably the world’s greatest collector of oceanographic data, has a fleet of 15 research and survey vessels for the use of its scientists. Academic researchers can also apply to use the fleet, often at a subsidized rate. But scientists request roughly 15,000 to 20,000 days of boat time every year. In 2019, NOAA was able to fill just 2,300 of them, according to an internal study.

That gap is particularly problematic as the planet warms. Oceans provide services that scientists call “existentially important,” producing more than half of the oxygen we breathe and serving as the world’s largest carbon sink. They also absorb 30% of our carbon emissions and 90% of the excess heat generated by them.

G. Mark Miller, a retired NOAA Corps officer who was in charge of several of the agency’s research vessels, has a different solution in mind when it comes to bolstering ocean research: smaller boats, fit for purpose. Superyachts can cost north of $500 million, he says; “why don’t we build a hundred $5 million vessels and flood the ocean science community?”

After leaving NOAA, Miller in 2021 launched Virginia-based Greenwater Marine Sciences Offshore with a vision of building a global fleet of research vessels and offering their use at affordable prices. He says hiring a NOAA boat can cost scientists between $20,000 and $100,000 per day. GMSO plans to charge less than $10,000 a day for most missions. The company says it’s close to acquiring its first three vessels.

Miller hopes his business model will help scientists conduct the work they need to — particularly in under-served regions like the Asia-Pacific — without worrying about getting a luxury yacht covered in “muddy worms, plankton goo, dead fish [and] whale snot.” He describes yacht owners donating boat time to scientists as “better than nothing,” and says it can help get regular people interested in science and exploration.

Christopher Walsh, captain of the Archimedes, says he and his crew love taking part in science initiatives, especially when there’s an educational component. “I get a real thrill when we can stream to the classrooms — you can’t imagine the enthusiasm the kids display,” Walsh says. “That gives me a lot of hope for the future.”","Brewin’s was not your typical superyacht itinerary, but he is one of hundreds of scientists to have used an adventure yacht — also known as expedition or explorer yachts — to conduct research on the ocean.

Fortune,https://fortune.com/2024/06/30/lab-grown-meat-florida-ban-upside-foods-cell-cultured-chicken-ron-desantis/,2024-06-30,14:55:34 UTC,"Ahead of Florida’s ban on ‘lab-grown’ meat, consumers get their first—and possibly last—taste at Miami party","As Florida’s ban on “lab-grown” meat is set to go into effect next week, one manufacturer hosted a last hurrah — at least for now — with a cultivated meat-tasting party in Miami.

California-based Upside Foods hosted dozens of guests Thursday evening at a rooftop reception in the city’s Wynwood neighborhood, known for its street art, breweries, nightclubs and trendy restaurants.

“This is delicious meat,” Upside Foods CEO and founder Uma Valeti said. “And we just fundamentally believe that people should have a choice to choose what they want to put on their plate.”

The U.S. approved the sale of what’s now being called “cell-cultivated” or “cell-cultured” meat for the first time in June 2023, allowing Upside Foods and another California company, Good Meat, to sell cultivated chicken.

Earlier this year, Florida and Alabama banned the sale of cultivated meat and seafood, which is grown from animal cells. Other states and federal lawmakers also are looking to restrict it, arguing the product could hurt farmers and pose a safety risk to the public.

While Florida cattle ranchers joined Gov. Ron DeSantis when he signed the ban into law in May, Valeti said Florida officials never reached out to his company before passing the legislation.

“It’s pretty clear to us that the governor and the government have been misinformed,” Valeti said. “And all we’re asking for is a chance to have a direct conversation and say, ‘this is proven science, this is proven safety.’”

Cultivated products are grown in steel tanks using cells from a living animal, a fertilized egg or a storage bank. The cells are fed with special blends of water, sugar, fats and vitamins. Once they’ve grown, they’re formed into cutlets, nuggets and other shapes.

Chef Mika Leon, owner of Caja Caliente in Coral Gables, prepared the cultivated chicken for Thursday’s event, which invited members of the South Florida public to get their first, and possibly last, taste of cultivated meat before Florida’s ban begins Monday. Leon served chicken tostadas with avocado, chipotle crema and beet sprouts.

“When you cook it, it sizzles and cooks just like chicken, which was insane,” Leon said. “And then when you go to eat it, it’s juicy.”

Reception guest Alexa Arteaga said she could imagine cultivated meat being a more ethical alternative.

“The texture itself is a little bit different, but the taste was really, really good,” Arteaga said. “Like way better than I was expecting.”

Another guest, Skyler Myers, agreed about the texture being different when eating a piece of meat by itself but said it just seemed like normal chicken when he ate the tostada.

“There’s no difference,” Myers said. “I mean, there’s no way you would ever know.”

Besides the ethical issues surrounding the killing of animals, Valeti said cultivated meat avoids many of the health and environmental problems created by the meat industry, such as deforestation, pollution and the spread of disease. He also noted that the meat his company produces is not coming from a lab but from a facility more closely resembling a brewery or a dairy processing plant.

“We don’t have any confined animals,” Valeti said. “We just have healthy animal cells that are growing in cultivators.”

The restrictions come despite cultivated meat and seafood still being too expensive to reach the market in a meaningful way. Two high-end U.S. restaurants briefly added the products to their menus, but it hasn’t been available at any U.S. grocery stores. Companies have been working to bring down costs by scaling up production, but now they’re also trying to respond to bans with petitions and possible legal action.

Sean Edgett, Upside Foods chief legal officer, said the company went through a yearslong process with the U.S. Department of Agriculture and the Food and Drug Administration before receiving approval. He said those federal regulations should supersede any state bans, which he believes are unconstitutional.

“We’re hopeful that if lawmakers can’t change their mind and turn things around back to an avenue of progress that the courts will step in and make that clear,” Edgett said.

Backers of the bans say they want to protect farmers and consumers from a product that only has been around for about a decade.

State Sen. Jay Collins, a Republican who sponsored the Florida bill, noted the legislation doesn’t ban research, just the manufacturing and sale of cultivated meat. Collins said safety was his primary motivator, but he also wants to protect Florida agriculture.

“Let’s not be in a rush to replace something,” Collins said earlier this year. “It’s a billion-dollar industry. We feed a ton of people across the country with our cattle, beef, pork, poultry and fish industries.”

Valeti isn’t trying to replace any industry, just give people more options, he said.

“We want to have multiple choices that feed us,” Valeti said. “Some of those choices are conventional farming. Some of those choices are coming from plant-based foods. And cultivated meat is another solid choice.”","California-based Upside Foods hosted dozens of guests Thursday evening at a rooftop reception in the city’s Wynwood neighborhood, known for its street art, breweries, nightclubs and trendy restaurants.

Fortune,https://fortune.com/2024/06/30/democratic-party-joe-biden-presidential-debate-dnc-campaign-election-strategy/,2024-06-30,14:28:17 UTC,Democratic Party insiders say DNC and campaign officials are gaslighting them about Joe Biden’s debate debacle and his election hopes,"A sense of concern is growing inside the top ranks of the Democratic Party that leaders of Joe Biden’s campaign and the Democratic National Committee are not taking seriously enough the impact of the president’s troubling debate performance earlier in the week.

DNC Chairman Jaime Harrison and Biden campaign manager Julie Chavez Rodriguez held a Saturday afternoon call with dozens of committee members across the country, a group of some of the most influential members of the party. They largely ignored Biden’s weak showing Thursday night or the avalanche of criticism that followed.

Multiple committee members on the call, most granted anonymity to talk about the private discussion, described feeling like they were being gaslighted — that they were being asked to ignore the dire nature of the party’s predicament. The call, they said, may have worsened a widespread sense of panic among elected officials, donors and other stakeholders.

Instead, the people said, Harrison offered what they described as a rosy assessment of Biden’s path forward. The chat function was disabled and there were no questions allowed.

“I was hoping for more of a substantive conversation instead of, ‘Hey, let’s go out there and just be cheerleaders,’ without actually addressing a very serious issue that unfolded on American television for millions of people to see,” said Joe Salazar, an elected DNC member from Colorado, who was on the call. “There were a number of things that could have been said in addressing the situation. But we didn’t get that. We were being gaslit.”

Many donors, party strategists and rank-and-file DNC members are publicly and privately saying they want the 81-year-old Biden to step aside to allow the party to select a younger replacement at the Democratic National Convention in August. As of now, though, Biden’s closest allies insist he remains well-positioned to compete against Republican Donald Trump and have given no indication they will push him to end his campaign.

Those best positioned to replace him — Vice President Kamala Harris, California Gov. Gavin Newsom and Michigan Gov. Gretchen Whitmer among them — reiterated their support for Biden after the debate.

Many are anxiously awaiting the first major round of post-debate public polling to determine their next steps.

Polls from CNN and 538/Ipsos conducted soon after the debate found that most debate-watchers thought Trump outperformed Biden. But the two men’s favorability ratings remained largely unchanged, just as they did in the aftermath of Trump’s conviction on charges in New York that he illegally participated in a hush money scheme to influence the 2016 election.

In a subsequent appearance on MSNBC, Harrison downplayed the significance of the conference call, which he said was part of a regularly scheduled communication “to talk about the state of the race” and the upcoming national convention with the DNC’s many elected members across the country.

Biden and his campaign have sought to project confidence in the days since Thursday’s debate in which the president, who already faced serious concerns about his physical and mental stamina, offered a performance punctuated by repeated stumbles, uncomfortable pauses, and a quiet speaking style that was often difficult to understand.

Just after Saturday’s DNC call, the Biden campaign released a memo from senior adviser Jen O’Malley Dillon insisting that the debate had no tangible impact on the election.

“On every metric that matters, data shows it did nothing to change the American people’s perception, our supporters are more fired up than ever, and Donald Trump only reminded voters of why they fired him four years ago and failed to expand his appeal beyond his MAGA base,” O’Malley Dillon wrote.

She added, “If we do see changes in polling in the coming weeks, it will not be the first time that overblown media narratives have driven temporary dips in the polls.”

Meanwhile, Biden spent much of Saturday courting wealthy donors in New York’s famed wealthy enclave of the Hamptons.

“I didn’t have a great night, but neither did Trump,” Biden said of the debate at one gathering in East Hampton.

Of Trump, Biden said, “The big takeaway was his lies.”

Harrison reinforced the president’s message on the DNC call, which spanned roughly an hour. Hannah Muldavin, a DNC spokesperson, said the discussion was a regularly scheduled quarterly conference call with the committee’s membership.

The topics included Biden’s energetic North Carolina appearance the day after the debate and a fundraising surge that produced more than $27 million for the campaign between debate day through Friday evening, Muldavin said.

Harrison did not ignore the debate altogether in his remarks, she said.

He briefly referenced Biden’s comments from his North Carolina speech that he doesn’t debate as well as he used to, but that he knows how to get up when he gets knocked down.

Salazar noted that Harrison also suggested that party leaders always knew the 2024 presidential contest would be close, a regular Democratic talking point that irks Salazar.

“This should not be a close race,” Salazar said, pointing to Trump’s criminal record and long history of falsehoods. “They’re the ones who should be looking for a new nominee, not us. And unfortunately for us, because of our president’s performance on Thursday night, that is now an open discussion.”","A sense of concern is growing inside the top ranks of the Democratic Party that leaders of Joe Biden’s campaign and the Democratic National Committee are not taking seriously enough the impact of the president’s troubling debate performance earlier in the week.
Polls from CNN and 538/Ipsos conducted soon after the debate found that most debate-watchers thought Trump outperformed Biden.
Just after Saturday’s DNC call, the Biden campaign released a memo from senior adviser Jen O’Malley Dillon insisting that the debate had no tangible impact on the election.
“I didn’t have a great night, but neither did Trump,” Biden said of the debate at one gathering in East Hampton.
Of Trump, Biden said, “The big takeaway was his lies.”Harrison reinforced the president’s message on the DNC call, which spanned roughly an hour.","['trump', 'election', 'debate', 'insiders', 'democratic', 'campaign', 'biden', 'members', 'harrison', 'hopes', 'bidens', 'joe', 'say', 'gaslighting', 'dnc', 'officials', 'party']","https://fortune.com/img-assets/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/GettyImages-2159611750-e1719757163473.jpg?resize=1200,600",,fml lah,sens concern grow insid top rank democrat parti leader joe biden 's campaign democrat nation committe take serious enough impact presid 's troubl debat perform earlier week dnc chairman jaim harrison biden campaign manag juli chavez rodriguez held saturday afternoon call dozen committe member across countri group influenti member parti larg ignor biden 's weak show thursday night avalanch critic follow multipl committe member call grant anonym talk privat discuss describ feel like gaslight -- ask ignor dire natur parti 's predica call said may worsen widespread sens panic among elect offici donor stakehold instead peopl said harrison offer describ rosi assess biden 's path forward chat function disabl question allow `` i hope substant convers instead of hey let 's go cheerlead ' without actual address serious issu unfold american televis million peopl see '' said joe salazar elect dnc member colorado call `` there number thing could said address situat did n't get that gaslit '' mani donor parti strategist rankandfil dnc member public privat say want yearold biden step asid allow parti select younger replac democrat nation convent august now though biden 's closest alli insist remain wellposit compet republican donald trump given indic push end campaign best posit replac -- vice presid kamala harri california gov gavin newsom michigan gov gretchen whitmer among -- reiter support biden debat mani anxious await first major round postdeb public poll determin next step poll ipso conduct soon debat found debatewatch thought trump outperform biden two men 's favor rate remain larg unchang aftermath trump 's convict charg new york illeg particip hush money scheme influenc elect subsequ appear msnbc harrison downplay signific confer call said part regular schedul communic `` to talk state race '' upcom nation convent dnc 's mani elect member across countri biden campaign sought project confid day sinc thursday 's debat presid alreadi face serious concern physic mental stamina offer perform punctuat repeat stumbl uncomfort paus quiet speak style often difficult understand saturday 's dnc call biden campaign releas memo senior advis jen o'malley dillon insist debat tangibl impact elect `` on everi metric matter data show noth chang american peopl 's percept support fire ever donald trump remind voter fire four year ago fail expand appeal beyond maga base '' o'malley dillon wrote ad `` if see chang poll come week first time overblown media narrat driven temporari dip poll '' meanwhil biden spent much saturday court wealthi donor new york 's fame wealthi enclav hampton `` i did n't great night neither trump '' biden said debat one gather east hampton trump biden said `` the big takeaway lie '' harrison reinforc presid 's messag dnc call span rough hour hannah muldavin dnc spokesperson said discuss regular schedul quarter confer call committe 's membership topic includ biden 's energet north carolina appear day debat fundrais surg produc million campaign debat day friday even muldavin said harrison ignor debat altogeth remark said briefli referenc biden 's comment north carolina speech doe n't debat well use to know get get knock down salazar note harrison also suggest parti leader alway knew presidenti contest would close regular democrat talk point irk salazar `` this close race '' salazar said point trump 's crimin record long histori falsehood `` they re one look new nomine us unfortun us presid 's perform thursday night open discuss ''
Fortune,https://fortune.com/2024/06/30/lumber-prices-housing-post-pandemic-double-bubble-hangover/,2024-06-30,12:05:00 UTC,Lumber prices are plunging. Blame the record drop in U.S. housing affordability and a post-pandemic double bubble ‘hangover’,"The twin-peaked lumber bubble of 2021 and 2022 that once drove home building costs through the roof and exacerbated inflation is now nothing more than a memory.

Spot lumber prices have plummeted 75% from their May 2021 record high of $1,514 per thousand board feet to just $366 this week, roughly matching pre-pandemic levels, according to Random Lengths’ Framing Lumber Composite Price Index. Lumber’s price drop has been particularly dramatic in just the last 90 days in the futures market, with contract prices for July falling 28% to $466 per thousand board feet (futures prices are around $100 above spot prices due to a delivery fee).

Industry experts blame the record drop in U.S. housing affordability and a slowdown in home renovations for quashing lumber demand. It’s just too expensive for consumers to buy new homes or renovate their current ones. That’s led to fewer construction projects, and slowing lumber sales. Meanwhile, overly optimistic industry demand forecasts amid hopes for plunging interest rates and rising home sales have led lumber mills to increase supply at the worst possible moment.

Put it all together and “it’s an ugly scenario” for the lumber market, Ashley Boeckholt, director of lumber and risk management at Sitka Forest Products USA, told Fortune. “We’re kind of having a hangover from a great three years.”

The demand side: A record deterioration in housing affordability and a renovation slowdown

The factors behind lumber’s price moves are varied and complex, but, as always, it all comes down to supply and demand. On the demand side, sky-high home prices and elevated mortgage rates have led to a record drop in U.S. housing affordability over the past few years. The Atlanta Federal Reserve’s Home Ownership Affordability Monitor (HOAM) Index is now at its lowest level since before the Global Financial Crisis of 2008.

As a result, even with an ongoing housing shortage, demand for new homes has remained subdued, leading to similarly weak demand for lumber to build them. “Housing affordability is just really offsides right now,” Dustin Jalbert, a senior economist who leads Fastmarkets’ Wood Products team, told Fortune. “It's one of the least affordable times to buy a house in decades and the pool of qualified buyers is starting to kind of dwindle a bit, too. So high interest rates eventually do start to bite.”

Weak demand for new homes led home builder confidence to drop to a five-month low last month, and housing starts fell 19% from a year ago. Most of that drop was the result of the 52% year-over-year plunge in multi-family housing starts. For a while, steady single-family home starts kept lumber prices from dropping significantly, because single-family homes use more wood than multi-family projects. But now that trend has flipped as well, with single-family housing starts down 2% year-over-year in May.

What’s more, the critical home-renovation market, which boomed during the pandemic helping to lift lumber prices, is also showing signs of weakness. HomeDepot saw its U.S. comparable sales sink 3.2% in the first quarter, for example. One of the reasons for the drop was “softer engagement in larger discretionary projects…such as kitchen and bath remodels,” Billy Bastek, the retailer’s executive vice president of merchandising, noted on its May earnings call.

Boeckholt, a veteran lumber trader who also hosts the weekly “Lumber Word” podcast, said he is seeing evidence of declining lumber demand from retail buyers as well. Traders like him are starting to receive “premium” lumber that is typically reserved for the Home Depots and Lowes of the world. “That generally means there's pushback” from retail buyers at home goods centers, he noted.

This home renovation slowdown, when combined with the U.S.’ long-running housing affordability challenges, has led to a serious lack of demand for wood products, particularly when compared to what was forecast just a year ago.

The supply-side: A hope-driven ‘bullwhip’ effect

While the demand side of the lumber market is ailing, the supply side may be in an even worse position. After lumber prices surged in 2021 and 2022, the lumber industry responded by investing to increase production. Many lumber veterans saw a long-term opportunity for increased demand for their products due to the housing shortage; and like many Americans, they also anticipated imminent interest-rate cuts which tend to drive more near-term lumber demand.

The only issue with this plan, as Fastmarkets’ Jalbert explained, is that it takes years to create new sawmills and increase lumber supply. This means that a lot of the new lumber supply that was commissioned during the pandemic is just now coming to market—at a time when added supply is the last thing the industry needs.

“It's a classic bullwhip,” Jalbert noted. “The supply side [responds] in a like manner to demand, and by the time it comes to the market that demand picture is already changed—and in this case in a negative way.”

Boeckholt backed up Jalbet’s argument, saying it’s an example of the “hangover” the lumber market is experiencing after its highly profitable pandemic years led to too much “hope” for more demand. That’s especially true “down in the southern U.S., where there have been mills in a pipeline to build for three or four years that have finally been coming on over the last year,” he said, adding that there was also a lot of investment into older mills to increase production in many regions nationwide.

What to expect from lumber prices through year-end 2024

When it comes to what to expect for the rest of this year, Boeckholt warned that lumber prices may languish near their current, pre-pandemic levels, with the potential for a minor—roughly $50—price increase in the fourth quarter. “There was a lot of hope out there, so when we wash all that hope out—which we will, eventually—that's when we'll bottom,” he said.

Jalbert also believes lumber prices will likely stagnate through year-end 2024, but in 2025, he argues things could turn around. Some sawmills will be forced to slow or shut down production due to depressed lumber prices in the second half of this year, lowering lumber supply—“the bullwhip in the opposite direction.”

That, coupled with interest rate cuts that could stoke lumber demand, will likely lead lumber futures prices to a range between $500 and $600, or slightly above pre-pandemic levels, according to Jalbert. “Supply is going to be cut and demand will recover,” he said. “But that's going to take time.”","Industry experts blame the record drop in U.S. housing affordability and a slowdown in home renovations for quashing lumber demand.

Fortune,https://fortune.com/2024/06/30/ju-rhyu-hero-cosmetics-gen-z-pimple-patches-secrets-to-success/,2024-06-30,12:00:00 UTC,How Hero Cosmetics’ CEO made once-shameful pimple patches a Gen Z status symbol,"Ju Rhyu can be your hero.

The cofounder and CEO of Hero Cosmetics might be best known for Mighty Patch, the ubiquitous barely-there pimple patch you may see on people’s faces everywhere from the grocery store, to the office, to a night on the town.

“When you have acne, you feel more insecure, you feel more introverted, you feel like everyone is staring at your face,” Rhyu, 45, told Fortune. “The products and solutions we offer really do work and really do save the day. It was really important for me to have something punchy, positive, and emotional.”

Hero emerged after Rhyu’s two-year stint in Korea for work, a country where skincare is decades ahead, and where pimple patches in public have been entirely normalized. With a pair of cofounders at her side and just $50,000, Rhyu sold her first set of Mighty Patches on Amazon for $12.99 in 2017. By 2022, the brand had notched $100 million in sales, and was acquired by consumer products powerhouse Church and Dwight for $630 million.

In the latest installment of Secrets to Success, Rhyu told Fortune how her time at Fortune 500 brands informed her leadership, why she puts her pimple patches in the cosmetic aisle (rather than their natural home in the Band-Aid aisle), what Korean skincare knows that American beauty doesn’t, and why her company keeps its branding simple and translucent instead of neon and star-shaped.

The following transcript has been lightly edited and condensed for clarity.

What is Hero Cosmetics?

It’s a functional skin solutions brand focused on acne. We’re best-known for the “money patch” hydrocolloid acne patches.

Where did you grow up, and what did your parents do?

I grew up in Seattle, Washington. My dad was a pretty successful entrepreneur, and I grew up with that inspiration in my life, and it fed a lot of my desire to be an entrepreneur one day.

We were very comfortable. My dad was in the log-export business. He was a log broker, which is why we lived in Seattle, Washington. He also did a few things in real estate, and he was very business-minded. I always grew up with the desire and the ambition to follow in his footsteps and try to be as financially successful as possible.

In high school, I played tennis, I was on my high school tennis team and I worked at the tennis club where I was taking lessons. I had the usual odd jobs here and there. I did sales, for example, at a department store during my summers away from college.

I went to college at Brown University and I studied history and international relations. I actually tried to start a business while I was in college, a design agency called Three P’s. So again, I think that [entrepreneurial] desire was always there, but I never really had that strong idea until Hero Cosmetics.

My first professional job after college was at a nonprofit called the Epiphany School, a charter school in Dorchester, Massachusetts. I worked in a fundraising capacity in the Development Office, which actually, at the end of the day, is really a sales and marketing job. That was my first job.

I actually graduated into two recessions, the first one being in 2001, and the second one being in 2008. My career has definitely not been linear. After that nonprofit job, right after undergrad, I wanted to go into business. I didn’t want to do something in marketing. That’s when I ended up applying to Columbia Business School.

I started in 2006, and then I did my internship at Kraft Foods, Mondelez, in consumer packaged goods. I did an internship in brand management. I worked on the Planters Peanuts brand. From there, I went full-time at American Express. And then I got recruited to work for Samsung in Korea as an expat for two years. That experience of living in Korea for two years is where I first used a hydrophilic acne patch, which eventually became the inspiration for my new passion, Hero Cosmetics.

I always joke that I worked at some of the world’s biggest brands—Kraft Foods, Mondelez, American Express, and Samsung Electronics—and then ended up starting an indie skincare brand.

Hydrocolloid patches were very popular in Korea?

This was back in 2012 and 2014. Those are the two years I spent in Korea—12 years ago. I was 35. Korea is really known in the beauty industry to be very ahead of the curve in terms of beauty, innovation, and adoption.

Back in 2012, people were already wearing them out in public. I would see people wearing them at the office, and I asked them what they were for and was told that they were for breakouts. I was suffering from a bunch of breakouts at that time.

I went to a pharmacy, I tried one, and it changed my skincare routine because it works so much better than anything I had used before. I put it on at night, and by morning, it got all that gunk out. My breakout was visibly and noticeably improved. Immediately I knew more people needed to know about it. And I actually saw from some of my research that people were wanting this type of product, so that became the inspiration for what is now Mighty Patch.

What was the branding like for the patches in Korea? Were they specifically branded for your face?

There were a lot of options back then. You could find some at pharmacies that were more medical or clinical-oriented. And then there were some you could buy at Olive Young, which is the Korean version of Sephora, which were a little bit more fun and cosmetic- and beauty-oriented. So there were two types of brands out there.

Growing up, I always had occasional breakouts. I never had severe acne, but at the worst moments, I would always have that breakout in the most embarrassing place on my face, like right on my nose or between my eyebrows. Like most people, I was always searching for a solution to get a better handle on my breakouts and acne.

I used every single possibility out there. I went to dermatologists, used toothpaste, used the pink creams, and nothing really worked, because a lot of those products can actually be very drying on your skin. That’s why I really love the hydrocolloid acne patches because they are tough on the problem but gentle on your skin—and they’re just so easy to use and very effective.

Prior to finding out about these patches, were you ever into dermatology before?

I wasn’t really into beauty or skincare. I actually learned about it a lot when I lived in Seoul for those two years. I learned about double cleansing and the different types of products and formats. My education started when I lived there, and then of course, now I’m in the beauty world, so I pay attention quite a bit.

Why do you position the patches in the beauty section instead of the Band-Aid section?

I credit a lot of my success at Hero Cosmetics to my corporate experience. I learned a lot of things at Kraft Foods and Mondelez and American Express that I really still use to this day. One of them is really paying attention to consumer behavior.

One of the consumer behaviors I noticed was that the hydrocolloid-patch format was actually already around for quite a long time, but they were in the Band-Aid aisle. And if you think about it, your breakout can be considered a type of wound, but there was nothing, at that time, in the beauty section.

And really the idea was, can we take this hydrocolloid bandage that sits in the Band-Aid aisle, and make something very specific to acne? I had already seen that people were buying the big bandages and cutting them up into small squares or small shapes and putting them all over their face. The behavior was already there; people were buying them in one aisle, but using them for a beauty concern. And that was really the insight of, hey, I think we can turn this into a beauty product and really market something that’s specific for acne.

How did you end up creating your first product?

I created the first product pretty quickly, actually. I had contacted more than 10 hydrocolloid-patch manufacturers while I was in Korea, but only two responded. Of those two, the one that we ended up working with, we still work with today. They’re obviously a really important partner to our business, and we worked with them to really develop what is now known as the Mighty Patch.

How old were you when the first product came out?

We launched the business in 2017. I was around 37.

How much did you start out selling your products for?

We priced our initial product, which was the 36-count Mighty Patch, at $12.99. The pricing actually was kind of an accident, because we were selling on Amazon, and there were already some players that were a lot cheaper—around $5. And I actually wanted to price our products at $9.99.

But the funny story is we couldn’t get Amazon Prime, and we were playing around with different things to see how we could unlock Prime. One of the ways was to increase our price to $12.99, and then that pricing just stuck.

Why did you decide to start selling them on Amazon?

It was strategic, but also a very practical decision. Back then, I didn’t really know that Amazon was poo-pooed upon by a lot of players in the beauty industry. But for us, I saw that the consumer was already buying this type of product on Amazon.

So again, there were a few other acne-patch players on Amazon at the time—not as many as today—but I saw that people were buying this type of product on Amazon, and the demand and the behavior was there. So it made a lot of sense for us to try it out. It was also the easiest, fastest, and cheapest, and we were bootstrapped.

It didn’t take a lot of money, investment, or resources to get up and running. You can get up and running, probably, in a day if you have the right images and copy. Amazon was a place for us to test and learn and to validate the thesis that people would really be into this type of product and this type of brand.

You mentioned there were a few other acne patch players; why do you think Mighty Patch in particular became so successful?

We’re still, even to this day, the number-one acne patch brand in the US. I think we have a superior product. We own a very special formula, and people can discern the difference between ours and our competition.

We have a brand that really resonates with a lot of people because it’s very inclusive and emotional. A lot of people can identify with our messaging and content. In the beginning, we actually only launched the patches, but I wanted to expand out very quickly into different product types.

I wanted to do a wash-off face mask, but someone told me to stick to patches, and do them in every shape, and every size for every need—just dominate this category. And I thought she was right, so that’s what we did. I think that expertise in this one category really led us to create a lot of trust, and it’s a big reason why we’re still number one.

How long did it take for your products to sell out?

The first purchase order for the brand was around 10,000 units, which we sold through in about 90 days. The launch and the uptick for us was pretty quick.

Can you describe your customer base?

It’s predominantly women. When we started Hero Cosmetics, the branding was actually very gender-inclusive. That was very intentional, because I wanted this brand to be for anybody and everybody who broke out. It wasn’t just for women, it wasn’t just for men. It was really for everybody. But interestingly, as we launched and built the business, the primary consumer ended up being more female. I don’t have the latest stats, but I think it’s around 75% female. They still are the largest consumer of most beauty brands and beauty products, ours included.

How did you fundraise to start the company?

We actually did not fundraise. Back in 2017, that was very against the grain. I tell people that sometimes zigging when others are zagging can work to your benefit. Back then, large funding rounds and raising VC dollars was very trendy. We did not do that; we decided to bootstrap.

We have two co-founders, and all three of us put our own money into the business. The philosophy was: This business needs to stand on its own two feet. This product needs to be cash flow positive and profitable. So we were very, very efficient with our dollars. In total, I think we launched with about $50,000 between us.

Some other companies have now created acne patches with a very bright design? What’s Hero’s strategy behind keeping its patches transparent?

There is a lot of competition in the category now, and I actually credit a lot of it to our success. Some brands have colors and shapes and are more fun. We haven’t done that; we maintain that transparent, more discreet patch format.

We’ve done that very intentionally to be inclusive and accommodate everyone, from the 14-year-old to people in their 50s. I think the way that we can do it is to be discreet. We acknowledge that the bright colors and shapes may work for some people, but it won’t work for everybody. We launched with the more translucent, discreet patches, and we’re the experts in it. That’s sort of our thing.

You’ve mentioned that you believe a lot of these other companies created pimple patches due to Mighty Patch’s success.

My thoughts on competition are: A rising tide lifts all boats. I think we’re all creating this category together. It’s a new category, a new product format, and I welcome other players because the education they do in the marketplace really helps us all.

It’s become pretty common to see people wearing patches out in public. Why do you think people are feeling so comfortable doing so?

When I see people wearing acne patches out in public, I actually feel really proud about what we’ve done. I was really trying to make acne more acceptable and really talk more positively about acne and understanding that it’s no big deal. So many Americans, and really people all over the world, break out from time to time.

I think over 60 million Americans will have acne at some point. So I love seeing people wear them to the office or just out and about, because I think what it means to me is we’ve done our job and broken down the taboo aspect of acne and made it okay to be almost proud of it.

It’s also very popular for people to wear pimple patches on social media. What’s that impact been on the business?

Social media, for us, obviously has been such a key factor in our rise as a brand and as a business. Especially in terms of educating the market, because, again, it’s a new product category and a new product format and education was really key. So social media, Instagram and TikTok—we call it the magic moment. The magic moment is when you peel off the patch and can show how well it works on social media. That shock factor of, oh my god, look at all that gunk. That type of content goes viral a lot, and that virality helps with education. Social media, obviously, has been so crucial to the success of our business.

What was the process of creating the Mighty Patch formula? How many tests did you have to go through until you found the perfect one?

We relied a lot on our manufacturer for the formula, which many beauty brands do. It was a formula that has been perfected over the years. Every brand has their own formula for making the hydrocolloid gel, and we found what we felt was the right balance in terms of adhesion, and efficacy, and something that was discreet enough to be wearable in public. I think we landed on the right one.

Why and how did you choose the name Hero Cosmetics?

When we were starting the brand, it was really important to me that we have a name that was both emotional and positive, because from my personal experience, when you have acne, you feel more insecure, you feel more introverted, you feel like everyone is staring at your face. And the products and solutions we offer really do work and really do save the day. It was really important for me to have something punchy, positive, and emotional.

When we came up with Mighty Patch, I just knew that was a perfect name. It connected the power and the strength and was sort of whimsical. The Hero Cosmetics name is because we wanted our products to be the ‘hero products’ in people’s everyday skincare routines.

When did you actually start creating different products?

I never wanted Hero to be just a patch business or patch brand. It’s funny; the downside of being so strong in this patch category is sometimes people think that our brand name is Mighty Patch. But actually, the brand name is Hero and Mighty Patch is just a product, and we do have other products. I always wanted to create an acne brand and acne-care brand that was a full solution.

For a daily-care treatment, we have something that we refer to as “Repair and Restore.” And actually, what we see in our business is that most people come through the Mighty Patch franchise. We acquire brands through the Mighty Patch product, but a lot of people are so satisfied with that experience that we ended up cross-selling and upselling across our portfolio.

But we do have a suite. We have a toner, we have a cleansing balm, we have the rescue balm franchise, and we have a lot of other products. And so we welcome people through Mighty Patch, and then we introduce them to the other suite of products from there on.

I never wanted Hero Cosmetics to be just a patch business or a patch brand. Mighty Patch is our most well-known franchise. We did start with them. We are the experts in this category. It’s amazing to see how we built the Mighty Patch as an acquisition engine into the brand for consumers and it lets us introduce them to our entire suite of other products.

Do you have a perspective on work-life balance?

I think when you’re an entrepreneur, it’s less about balance, and more about work-life integration. For example, I was living in Paris for six years. And there’s a six-hour time difference between New York, where our business is based, and Paris. Luckily, over there, we ate late, at 8pm. But I would not take meetings or calls after dinner. I told the team, I’d respond to emails or Slacks, but I wouldn’t take calls.

For me, it’s really just about finding a schedule that works for you. It’ll be different for everyone. I don’t think we can expect anyone to be on all the time, 24/7. Setting those guardrails is healthy for everybody.

What’s your philosophy on remote work? Do you find it challenging to have a group of predominantly remote employees?

I like remote work. I work from home, but I do go to the New York office from time to time. My philosophy is that you need a balance of both. I would find it difficult if you’re 100% remote all the time, because I think culture is really important, and it’s hard to build culture online.

The other thing I don’t like about remote work is that I don’t get to build relationships with people. If you’re just on a screen, I don’t really talk to you, which, to me, is kind of sad. But when I go to the office, I love having casual watercooler conversations, like: What did you do this weekend? Any new restaurants you’ve checked out? I love doing that with people who I might not have meetings with on a daily basis. For me, it’s both. I think both are great.","With a pair of cofounders at her side and just $50,000, Rhyu sold her first set of Mighty Patches on Amazon for $12.99 in 2017.

Fortune,https://fortune.com/well/article/headspace-app-finding-your-best-sleep/,2024-06-30,09:10:00 UTC,Finding Your Best Sleep: Lessons learned from guided Headspace course,"I still don’t know how the “Enchanted Moonlight Library” sleepcast episode ends. Which, I suppose, is the point. A sleepcast is exactly what it sounds like: a podcast intended to help you doze off. Or, perhaps I have heard “the end” and never knew it; Headspace, the mental health app housing the audio content, slightly remixes its bedtime stories nightly so anxious sleepers like me can’t track time by memorizing the narrative. (Sneaky, but effective, I can confirm.)

I began Headspace’s 18-session Finding Your Best Sleep course in April, seeking strategies to quiet my worry-prone mind and fall asleep more quickly. The lessons, which include brief videos and guided meditations, are spread across three modules: Understand your sleep; Try something new; and Practice, practice, practice.

For roughly 10 minutes a night for nearly three weeks, I embraced all the materials the program had to offer—even optional bonus videos that didn’t pertain to me, including ones on sleeping comfortably while pregnant and navigating shift work. This added perspective helped me triage my sleep habits and what I hoped to improve.

While not part of the course, the 45-minute-long sleepcasts are included with membership, along with other bedtime tools such as:

Nighttime SOS: I utilized this feature a few times when I woke up in the middle of the night and couldn’t fall back asleep. The guided exercise track “Racing Mind SOS” came in handy.

Headspace costs $12.99/month with a weeklong free trial, or $5.83/month billed as $69.99/year with a two-week free trial. Postsecondary students can join for 83 cents/month billed as $9.99/year.

By design, not every tool featured in Finding Your Best Sleep worked for me. Worry time, for instance, the practice of confining your worries to a dedicated chunk of time each day, only made me more restless. The goal of the course was to discover the best sleep hygiene for me, and that it did. Here are five of my favorite sleep strategies I learned from Headspace.

Safeguard your sleep

The program encouraged me to put into practice something I’ve long known to be true: When I sleep better, life is better.

Adults ages 18–60 need at least seven hours of sleep each night, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). If I get fewer than eight, getting through the next day is akin to wading through mud. With proper rest, I’m a better daughter, sister, friend, and employee. I’m not only more productive at home and work, but also kinder and happier.

Why, then, is achieving this crucial wellness component so difficult? The course urged me to not prioritize sleep but safeguard it—to respect it, protect it, and arrange the rest of my life to accommodate it instead of the other way around.

Sleep is a simple sacrifice when it seems there aren’t enough hours in the day to accomplish what needs to be done. Sometimes I still have to force myself to put aside whatever task feels like it can’t wait in order to put sleep first. And as if by magic, a solid night’s sleep gifts me time back the next day in the form of increased energy and efficiency.

Sleep space is sacred—including the bed

I knew that a calming bedroom environment is critical to restful sleep. Catching z’s in a cool, dark, quiet, and comfortable place is ideal, the CDC says. TVs in the bedroom are frowned upon, and screen time should be cut off at least 30 minutes before bedtime, especially when blue light is involved.

Headspace, however, stresses that the bed itself should be off-limits to just about anything other than sleeping. That means no eating, working, or doomscrolling in bed. That way, your brain associates the bed with sleep—not meals, emails, or social media.

We’ve all been there, but neither should your bed be a place you toss and turn in mental agony, mulling over yesterday’s mistakes and tomorrow’s to-do list. If trying to fall asleep makes your thoughts race and you’re still awake after 20 minutes or so, Finding Your Best Sleep recommends getting out of bed and doing a relaxing activity in another room until you’re sleepy.

A good night’s sleep begins in the morning

Taking time each night to prepare for the next morning was already second nature to me; laying out my gym clothes and packing a lunch makes for a less hectic start to the day. But before Headspace, I hadn’t considered how I could prepare for a good night’s sleep throughout the day.

Because your wake-up time keeps your circadian rhythm, or body clock, in check, merely waking up at a consistent time every morning—yes, including weekends—primes you for falling asleep at your preferred bedtime. Sunlight exposure in the morning helps, too.

I’m not typically an afternoon coffee drinker, but intentionally limiting my lattes to before noon helps me wind down earlier in the evening. I also now eat dinner earlier to allow more time for digestion before bed. I’ve become more diligent about making my bed in the morning, which makes the evening turn-down a kind of ritual. I’ve even started laying out my pajamas in the morning and look forward to finding other ways to make my nights easier during the day.

Settle in with a story

Thanks, Mom, for always reading me to sleep; I’ve kept the security blanket of storytelling close. Yet when I read from my Kindle or iPad in bed, even on dark or warm-light mode, I’m still staring at a screen with distractions a tap away. Reading a physical book means my bedside lamp stays on, and when I listen to an audiobook in the dark, I find myself straining my ears to stay awake and listen.

This is where Headspace’s sleepcasts save the day. I still enjoy reading in the evening, but once I’m in bed, it’s time for a deliberately dozy story, one pleasant enough that it can take my mind off things but insubstantial enough that I don’t mind falling asleep in the middle of it. My favorite part is that each sleepcast starts with a wind-down meditation to calm the body before luring the mind into story.

Work hard, sleep hard

I don’t mean you have to tire yourself out to deserve decent sleep—though without fail I sleep better the night following a workout. Rather, Headspace has taught me to work hard at sleeping well. Sleep is at once a vital bodily function and a fragile goal to be attained.

It doesn’t take much for my sleep routine to get off track, and I’d be lying if I said I’ve seamlessly and consistently integrated the hacks I’ve learned into my sleep hygiene these past few months. The nights I did manage to, though, were followed by brighter days. Which reminds me, it’s time to go pick out tonight’s jammies.

Fortune,https://fortune.com/2024/06/29/nfl-sunday-ticket-antitrust-lawsuit-ruling-tv-rights-revenue-teams/,2024-06-29,23:29:05 UTC,The shocking $4.7 billion ruling against the NFL could disrupt the balance of power between the league and its teams,"The NFL has rarely been a loser on the field, but a lopsided blowout in an antitrust lawsuit could change how the world’s richest sports league generates and distributes billions of dollars in revenue every year.

A Los Angeles jury on Thursday sided with fans who claimed the league conspired with DirecTV to raise the price of subscriptions to watch games broadcast out of their team’s home market. The $4.7 billion in damages could be tripled under federal law.

That doesn’t mean the game is over.

The judge could potentially slash the verdict or even throw it out entirely and rule in the NFL’s favor. He didn’t look favorably on the fans’ arguments during the trial, and he dismissed the case back in 2019 before it turned into a class action. Post trial motions are set for July 31.

“It’s a real serious problem, but there’s a long way to go,” said Patrick Crakes, a media consultant and former Fox Sports executive who helped to negotiate the network’s deals with the NFL. “As far as the bigger picture goes and the NFL’s place in the media landscape and their value, it’s not going to stop them. They are going to keep rolling on.”

If the verdict stands, the NFL said it will appeal all the way to the Supreme Court, prolonging a case that dates back to 2015. The Mucky Duck bar in San Francisco filed the original lawsuit, arguing that the NFL’s Sunday Ticket forced viewers to pay for out-of-market games even when their team wasn’t playing — and charged high prices for it. In other words, as a fan you must buy the rights to every game on a Sunday, not just when your team plays.

The jury took less than a day of deliberations to decide that was unfair. The verdict is a shock to how sports are offered to consumers, and a major blow to the NFL, so used to having the Midas touch. Even though it will appeal, the league has to plan for the potential costs of losing.

It’s hard to know how much cash the NFL has. As a private company, it doesn’t share its finances. Back in 2010, NFL Commissioner Roger Goodell set a revenue target of $25 billion by 2027.

Right now, one way to estimate the NFL’s revenue puts it at about $12 billion, according to the annual statement of the Green Bay Packers, the only NFL team that publishes its finances. Each of the 32 teams get the same amount from the NFL, and the Packers got $374.4 million in 2022, the last available figures.

FIFA, the world soccer body, is the only other sports organization that competes with the NFL in terms of money, at least during a World Cup year. It made over $6 billion from the Qatar World Cup in 2022. It has about $4 billion in cash reserves.

If FIFA has that much cash, you can assume that the NFL at least has the ability to save up and pay the verdict, but it will take some time. So will the appeal.

Power Shift

The next issue – assuming the verdict isn’t overturned — could be a power shift between the NFL and its teams.

The NFL has kept its members happy by signing massive TV deals that makes everyone rich. The NFL will get $110 billion from its 11-year TV deal signed in 2021.

The NFL has always been special. In 1961, congress passed the Sports Broadcasting Act, after a US district court ruled the NFL was breaking antitrust rules by pooling rights in a deal with CBS.

The Act allowed the NFL to bundle all the teams’ rights together to make the league economically viable. But the Act focused on broadcast deals, while the Mucky Duck lawsuit focused on whether the NFL broke antitrust laws with the Sunday Ticket package offered by DirecTV, a satellite provider.

If the verdict stands, teams could be granted the opportunity to sell their local rights and out-of-market games on cable or even a streaming service. The temptation could be strengthened if the NFL tried to pass on the cost of the fine to each team — a potential hit that could be anywhere from $150 million to $450 million.

“Ultimately, it’s a free market, and the hope is that it will create more opportunity for people to view the NFL product,” said Sarah Hartley, a sports law lecturer at the University of Virginia School of Law and a partner at Bryan Cave Leighton Paisner. But she also cautioned that legal process is far from over.

YouTube

Starting in 2023, YouTube replaced DirecTV as the home of Sunday Ticket. It pays the NFL $2 billion a year and it charges customers $349. Even though the case didn’t involve YouTube, it’s hard to tell if the streaming platform will be better off giving more money to a team with a bigger fan base, and viewers. It’s also hard to know whether team owner thinks they can strike a better deal on their own.

Dallas Cowboys owner Jerry Jones admitted as much during the trial. “I’m convinced I would make a lot more money than the Bengals,” he said on the stand. It got some laughs.

Jones is arguably the architect for the NFL being funded by TV revenues. Back in 1992, CBS and NBC actually lost money on NFL broadcasts. The NFL broadcast committee wanted to give the networks millions in rebates. Jones said no, brought in a new network called Fox, and started a bidding war.

When Jones fought back against the rebate, he was a new owner after buying the Cowboys in 1989 for $140 million. It’s now worth billions. There are now new owners looking to make their own mark.","Back in 2010, NFL Commissioner Roger Goodell set a revenue target of $25 billion by 2027.

Fortune,https://fortune.com/2024/06/29/chinese-ev-tariff-loophole-golf-cart-imports-club-car-textron-ustr/,2024-06-29,23:06:28 UTC,"A loophole in U.S. tariffs on Chinese EVs has allowed a flood of golf cart imports, and domestic producers are asking Biden for help","The two largest golf cart producers in the US are asking for relief from an existential hazard: a flood of Chinese imports.

Club Car LLC and Textron Specialized Vehicles Inc., both based near Augusta, Georgia, asked the Biden administration this week to slap a 100% tariff on golf carts and other low-speed, often battery-powered personal vehicles made in China — putting them on par with the US tariff on regular Chinese electric automobiles.

“Chinese import volumes have rapidly increased, taking greater consumer vehicle market share while using price benefits from Chinese government subsidies to drive their advantage,” Club Car President and CEO Mark Wagner said in an emailed statement Friday. “We had to take action.”

US imports of Chinese golf carts and other recreational buggies have increased sixfold since 2020, partly because they’re shipped under a product classification where the tariff is lower than those coded as normal-sized EVs. The Chinese carts often avoid higher levies by crossing the border at the lower tariff rate and then undergoing modifications in the US, according to the American companies’ attorneys.

As a result, the golf carts and similar vehicles “are able to skirt the proposed increased duties on electric vehicles” announced by the Biden administration in May, according to a letter filed this week with the US Trade Representative in Washington.

The skirmish between the world’s largest economies is narrow, but it illustrates the scores of loopholes, workarounds, unintended consequences and legal quandaries that accompany the imposition of tariffs across a swath of the economy.

Comment Deadline

Friday was the deadline for public comment on USTR’s so-called 301 case, under which tariffs on Chinese goods are justified.

The filing from Club Car and Textron, which makes E-Z-GO and Cushman carts, was among hundreds of other pleas for either tariff protection or relief posted during USTR’s comment window. The two companies made their case jointly under a group called the American Personal Transportation Vehicle Manufacturers Coalition.

According to the filing, imports of Chinese golf carts and another tariff classification for similar products called “specially designated vehicles” totaled $916 million last year, up from $148 million in 2020.

Club Car and Textron’s competitors in China have “substantially and systematically undersold domestically produced” vehicles, “resulting in a deterioration in the domestic industry’s performance and a sharp decline in the US industry’s production, capacity utilization, shipments, employment, and financial performance in 2024,” according to the June 25 letter to USTR from the Wiley law firm in Washington.

Their outreach to USTR follows a related case filed with the US Commerce Department and the US International Trade Commission, which alleged dumping of Chinese golf carts and sought relief in the form of anti-dumping and countervailing duties.

Robert DeFrancesco, a partner in Wiley’s international trade practice, said the process in that case will take about a year.","The two largest golf cart producers in the US are asking for relief from an existential hazard: a flood of Chinese imports.

Business Daily,https://www.businessdailyafrica.com/bd/lifestyle/health-fitness/ageless-fitness-exercise-tips-for-seniors-to-thrive-4673298,2024-06-30,04:00:00 UTC,Ageless fitness: Exercise tips for seniors to thrive,"If you search for workouts tailored to different age groups on the internet, you will find an astonishing array of over a thousand variations. No longer is exercise solely the domain of the youthful and trendy; seniors are increasingly embracing physical fitness.

While ageing is often linked with slowing down, older adults are challenging this stereotype.

Fred Oyugi, a personal trainer and CEO of Japesa Fitness and Adventure in Nairobi, says maintaining an active lifestyle is essential for a healthy and fulfilling life. Exercise, he notes, not only enhances physical health but also boosts mental well-being and emotional resilience.

Whether it's taking a leisurely walk in the park or joining a dance class, there are countless ways to stay active and enjoy life to the fullest.

“While exercise types remain similar across ages, intensity and approach differ. At 60, gentler workouts are essential compared to the more vigorous routines suitable for 40-year-olds,"" he says.

For those in their 60s, light strength training and bodyweight exercises are crucial, he advises.

Regardless of age, Fred stresses the importance of rest.

""Good training is three sessions a week. Rest is also a workout. Rest periods during workouts vary based on age and fitness level. For older women, longer rest periods of one to three minutes between exercises are essential to ensure they can perform the next set effectively without fatigue.

Fred notes that physical activity and regular exercise offer a multitude of benefits for seniors. These include increased energy levels, reduced risk or alleviation of chronic diseases, improved quality of sleep, decreased joint pain, stronger bones and muscles, and enhanced brain health and cognitive function.

“These advantages underscore the importance of staying physically active as we age, promoting overall well-being and a higher quality of life,” he underscores.

Mobility exercises

According to the personal trainer, several highly effective mobility exercises tailored for seniors include gentle neck stretches that involve tilting the head left, right, forward, and backwards to alleviate tension in the neck and upper back.

Seated leg lifts performed in a sturdy chair with feet placed flat on the floor help improve hip and thigh mobility by lifting one leg at a time and holding briefly before lowering.

Hip rotations, whether standing or sitting and using support as necessary, involve circular motions clockwise and counterclockwise to enhance hip mobility and reduce discomfort in the lower back.

Additionally, knee extensions done while seated in an upright position with feet flat on the floor strengthen the quadriceps and improve flexibility in the knees. These exercises are beneficial for seniors seeking to maintain or improve their mobility, contributing to overall physical well-being and quality of life.

Muscle strengthening

Furthermore, Fred highlights the effectiveness of bodyweight workouts for seniors, emphasising their ability to strengthen muscles without relying on external weights.

He notes that exercises like leg workouts can still be beneficial, acknowledging concerns about knee issues that might limit the use of weighted exercises, such as squats. Instead, focusing on bodyweight leg exercises can provide a safer alternative while still promoting strength and mobility in older adults.

“Leg workouts can be challenging for older persons due to knee issues, particularly when it comes to exercises like squats that involve weights. Older adults often already have knee problems, and performing squats with added weights can potentially exacerbate these issues and lead to injuries.

However, leg workouts using just body weight can still be safely incorporated into their exercise routine. This approach allows for strengthening and conditioning the legs without putting undue strain on compromised joints, promoting fitness and mobility while minimising the risk of injury,” he says.

Outdoor exercises

The gym isn't the only arena where his clients thrive; hiking and outdoor activities are integral to his holistic approach to fitness.

“Fitness isn't just about the gym; it's about enjoying life and staying active. So what we do is we prepare them for life after retirement. Preparing mentally is as important as preparing physically,"" he stresses.

Through his guidance, older adults not only build muscle but also fortify their minds against the challenges that come with ageing.

Minding the posture and diet

Posture, another cornerstone of Fred's training, is emphasised to prevent injuries. ""A slight mistake in posture can lead to significant issues,"" he warns, underscoring the importance of proper form in every exercise.

In terms of diet, he advocates for a balanced approach. ""Exercise and diet go hand in hand,"" he asserts. ""What you eat affects how you perform and recover."" He encourages his clients to adopt sustainable eating habits that complement their fitness goals.

Fitness trend

The evolution of fitness demographics is evident to Fred. ""Gone are the days when gyms were dominated by the young,"" he observes. ""Nowadays, older adults are taking charge of their health."" His clientele spans a wide age range, with individuals in their 80s embracing fitness as a lifestyle.

Other workouts include shoulder rolls: Roll your shoulders forward and backward in a slow, controlled manner to improve shoulder mobility and reduce stiffness.","No longer is exercise solely the domain of the youthful and trendy; seniors are increasingly embracing physical fitness.

Business Daily,https://www.businessdailyafrica.com/bd/lifestyle/weekend-with-the-ceo/harrison-muiru-the-one-question-as-a-man-in-my-40s-4673302,2024-06-29,12:30:00 UTC,Harrison Muiru: ‘The one question I ask myself as a man in my 40s’,"There is a phrase I love in the Star Trek movie franchise, about Captain Kirk and the Kobayashi Maru. It goes like this: It’s a test designed to draw inferences about someone’s character by giving them a no-win scenario and about how you, as a starship captain, face a situation when there are no good options. It doesn’t matter what you do, the simulation will throw the worst possible result at you. There is no cheat code. You can’t win, because the point of the test is to find out how you react to losing.

I imagine life to be a Kobayashi Maru. Your dreams, ambitions, relationships—everything really—you can’t use someone’s template. You wonder, what if I had picked the other road? So you wing it—leadership, fatherhood, manhood—there’s no formula.

Harrison Muiru, the Group Managing Director of Smart Applications International, has navigated his journey this way, seeking discernment but realising ultimately, we are playing with one hand tied behind our backs. He found joy where it matters: in his friends, wife, and three daughters—whom he witnessed getting birthed.

“That experience changes you,” he says, and I can detect the sunshine in his words—those same words that cast a shadow that further says, ultimately, it doesn’t matter whether you win or lose, but if you enjoyed the journey.

By the way, Captain Kirk was credited with “beating” the test, not passing it.

What’s a smart decision you made that got you where you are today?

I moved from the electronics part of engineering to the computer applications part of it. That was seen as a weaker move, but over time I have seen the convergence of electronics and computerisation. I thank God for the wisdom to make those choices.

Would you consider yourself a computer geek?

It depends. If you mean someone who likes sci-fi movies and occasionally reads about technology, then yes. But I also look at life wholesomely beyond what technology is, and its impact on society.

Not to be simplistic, but there are two camps, maybe three: Star Wars and Star Trek. What kind of sci-fi are you into?

I found Star Wars too off, it stretched fiction too much. I am more of a Star Trek which I think has the right kind of mix. And the matrix too.

In The Matrix, Neo is given two choices: the red pill (of truth) and the blue pill (illusions). Have you had such a fork-in-the-road moment?

Several times. At some point in my career, I was seconded to head an operation outside Kenya, but I sought a middle ground where I opted to do it temporarily so I could do what I was passionate about here in Kenya.

Was family part of this decision?

A very strong part, and I hold it dear—both my extended and immediate nuclear family. But also the familiarity of the Kenyan context, and what we can do to move our country forward.

What’s one aspect of family you hold close to your heart?

Moments of interaction, around things like weddings, dinners, outings, and also sacrifices where people are sick and we come together to support each other. Family is what makes us, and without my parents, wife, and children, I wouldn’t be where I am today.

What’s a moment you shared with your family that has stayed with you?

The birth of my three daughters. I saw them coming into this world, and it has been indescribable and transformative. When you are there, you appreciate life in a new way.

Are you one of those strong men who enter the labour room?

Yes, I am.

How does that change you?

As men, we are very much involved in the provision part of the family and can be quite obscured from it; but it is only at that time that you can know how provision connects to this new life coming into inception, walking into the world to be their own person. Every birth is a miracle, and it makes you appreciate humanity differently.

After you became a father, what aspect of your life did you choose to focus more on—or less on?

I chose to be a participatory father. And especially after my firstborn, I realised you can only learn on the job, and I encourage men to be in support groups, whether in church or close family. I take them to school, hear them out in terms of their experiences, and give them advice where required.

How are you raising your daughters differently from how you were raised?

We spent a lot of time with my mom—my father was out there earning for the family; he was a reverend in the church. I try to participate in my children’s lives. In the 70s and 90s, it was about working hard, now it is about working smart—leadership, social awareness, communication.

What family ritual have you created?

On Sundays, we go to church together. We have lunch together and spend the afternoon together. When the weather is good, Saturday afternoons are reserved for activities like swimming or visiting family and friends.

You largely grew up with your mom, and now you are a father of daughters, making you surrounded by women from childhood. How does that affect your sense of manhood?

Interesting, no one has broken it down to me like that. We were three boys and two girls in my family, but I believe as a man you get to appreciate how our ladies think and you get to be more understanding of them. It has made me a stronger person as we are driving toward inclusivity and gender equality—and understanding how to navigate the strengths and weaknesses of said male and female genders.

What’s your superpower as a dad?

Making my children laugh. Dad jokes!

With all these women surrounding you, what do you do just for yourself?

I have my groups of men, the chama, and the boys and I make space for them. We hang out monthly, and all of us are fathers, what we are going through and our relationships and pursue common projects.

What’s the one question you are asking yourself as a man now?

Finding balance in different responsibilities—we have a duty to the family, our society and our nation. Sometimes it can lead to a feeling of suffocation, so how do we manage those expectations while offering support to each other?

How would you describe your manhood so far? Has it been a burden or a launchpad?

I have gone through different phases, and I have decided to look at life through the lens of learning and continuous improvement. I do not regret being born a man and I continue to strive to be better.

Which is the easiest hat to wear: father, husband, CEO, or just a man?

Haha! Tough question. But, father. But these children are highly conscious of themselves at an early age, it is challenging and you have to accept to be questioned and be ready to answer those questions. As a father, you don’t want to lose credibility because children learn trust from their parents.

What’s your insecurity?

The fear of the unknown future and not being able to protect or provide for your family.

When was the last time you did something for the first time?

A month or so ago. I was on a mini desert safari, with a camel in Morocco. It was a technology conference that I was attending on behalf of the company.

Was it something you always wanted to try?

I challenged myself to do it, haha! It looked interesting at the moment.

Would you consider yourself a spontaneous person?

No. I am quite analytical, but it has grown on me that life is for the living, and therefore, when I have these moments, I challenge myself and jump on the opportunities as they come by.

If life is for the living, what is something you have been postponing that you are finally getting to do?

I am taking a cruise and skydiving. My daughters love water, I call them aquatic. I am a fire spirit; I avoid water but I have to conquer that fear and take them there.

What have you finally come to terms with?

Life is short. It has lessons, and if we take time to block out the noise and observe and listen to people and give them a chance, we find that life is quite abundant, and, in that abundance, life becomes fulfilling. That was my realisation when I got to the fourth floor, and has made me quite intentional about how I live my life and engage with the people around me.

What has the 40s given you that the 30s and 20s didn’t?

They say life begins at 40 hehe! My 20s were excitable, being spontaneous and pushing yourself toward risks. In your 30s you are settling in, getting the foundations for family and career. When you get to 40, you already know this is your compass, and you are grounded in your decisions to be bold and intentional.

What would the impressionable Harrison in his 20s, tell the 40-year-old you now?

Be more spontaneous and adventurous, and go for it, whatever it is. But he will also pat the 40-year-old and tell him, you’ve done well.

What matters more than you thought it would?

Family, particularly marriage. I have quite a supportive spouse. In the initial years, you don’t look at it that way, but you realise having a close and supportive family makes you have other achievements in life.

How do people show you love?

Haha! Is that on or off the record? I would say it is just recognising what someone has done or who they have been to you is more significant than the materiality of the reward. Sometimes we either forget or don’t pay attention.

What movies best encapsulate your life now?

The Avengers. I am in a state of my life where I am in a lot of collaborations where I am either creating, enjoying, or maintaining. The realisation is that no one can do it alone and you need to not only have the right networks and relationships in place but also do your part in said engagements. I am also taking on bigger challenges at work, and even as a family—like Thanos in the Avengers series. You have one shot to do it and you better have the right team members and support structures to make sure it is a win.

Who would you, out of curiosity, be in The Avengers?

Tony Stark’s Iron Man.

Business Daily,https://www.businessdailyafrica.com/bd/corporate/companies/why-banks-seek-treasury-nod-raising-interest-rates-4673248,2024-06-29,04:00:00 UTC,Why banks must seek Treasury’s nod before raising interest rates,"Banks and financial institutions must seek the approval of the Cabinet Secretary for National Treasury before increasing interest rates on loans and facilities advanced to customers, the Supreme Court has held.

A bench of five judges of the apex court presided by Chief Justice Martha Koome also held that Sections 44 and 52 of the Banking Act do not contradict or prohibit banks and financial institutions and their customers from bargaining and entering into a mutual contract concerning interest rates that will be applied to loan facilities.

However, the judges said interest rates on loans are subject to the regulation under Section 44 of the Banking Act, which states that “No institution shall increase its rate of banking or other charges except with the prior approval of the Minister.”

According to the court, while a contract that is mutually agreed by parties might provide the bank with the discretion to alter or vary interest rates on loans, that discretion is not absolute or unlimited.

“In conclusion on this issue, we find that interest rates on loans and facilities advanced by banks or financial institutions are subject to the regulatory process under Section 44 of the Banking Act,” the judges said.

The court added the approval of the Treasury Cabinet Secretary before increasing interest rates ensures that there is some check and balance or oversight to ensure that consumers of the loan facilities are not exploited and that the rates are reasonable.

The Banking (Increase of Rate of Banking And other Charges) Regulations, 2006, states that an application for approval of an increase in the rate of banking or other charges under Section 44 of the Act, shall be submitted to the Minister through the Central Bank of Kenya Governor.

Other Supreme Court judges who made the ruling were Deputy Chief Justice Philomena Mwilu, Justices Mohammed Ibrahim, Smokin Wanjala, and Njoki Ndung’u.

The judges were deciding a long-running dispute between Stanbic Bank and Santowels Ltd, a manufacturer of sanitary towels.

The manufacturer said its relationship with the bank hit the rocks in 2002 when it began having doubts concerning the interest charged by the lender. The company consequently paid its outstanding debt and closed its accounts with the lender the same year.

Santowels later engaged Interest Rates Advisory Centre (IRAC) Ltd to recalculate the interest charged on the Stanbic loans. IRAC found that the bank had overcharged the manufacturer interest amounting to Sh68 million.

The firm moved to court seeking a refund of the overcharged interest.

The matter moved to the Supreme Court as parties sought the court’s interpretation of the two sections of the Banking Act.

The lender argued in the second appeal that there are various court decisions on whether provisions of Sections 44 and 52 of the Banking Act apply to other bank charges, commissions, and rates but also to interest.

Stanbic Bank argued that there is uncertainty in the law as there are several contradicting decisions from the courts, on the question of rate of banking and interest variation and when ministerial consent is required.

Stanbic argued that regulations cannot override the provisions of Section 52(1) of the Banking Act, in cases where contractual charges are already in place.

The section states that ""For the avoidance of doubt, no contravention of the provisions of this Act or the Central Bank of Kenya Act shall affect or invalidate in any way any contractual obligation between an institution and any other person.""

Santowels, however, argued that the maximum rate that banks were entitled to charge their customers by law and as gazetted by CBK was 16.5 percent per annum on a reducing balance.

The court ruled that the interest it was charged was above what had been set by the CBK in 1997, hence illegal.

The Supreme Court said the primary objective of the Banking Act is to regulate banking business in Kenya.

“Secondly, the overarching reason for interest rate capping and/or regulation is to protect consumers from exploitative rates, to increase access to finance, and make credit affordable,” the judges added.

The court held that the effect of the repeal of Section 39 of the CBK Act and Section 33B of the Banking Act did not completely liberalise the interest rates that banks and financial institutions can charge.

Rather, it meant that regulation through capped interest rates was no longer in force, the court said.

The government in September 2016 imposed legal caps on lending rates at four percentage points above the Central Bank’s benchmark — then prevailing at nine percent — and set the maximum borrowing rate at 13 percent.

The caps were scrapped in 2019 after they were found unconstitutional by the High Court.

The Supreme Court said the regulation through the capping of interest rates simply set the parameters within which banks and financial institutions and their customers can negotiate or interact on the issue of interest rates.

“Based on our analysis and finding with respect to Section 44 of the Banking Act, the provision plays a different regulatory role yet complementary to that which capped interest rates played,” said the judges.","Banks and financial institutions must seek the approval of the Cabinet Secretary for National Treasury before increasing interest rates on loans and facilities advanced to customers, the Supreme Court has held.

On Friday, President Ruto signed into law Appropriations Bill 2024, which allows the national government and counties to spend even as he referred the County Allocation and Revenue Bill back to Parliament for reductions in allocations.

Dr Ruto said he signed the Appropriations Bill to “guarantee continuity of government operations, especially in providing critical services.”

“I have therefore assented to the Appropriations Bill 2024 and instructed the National Treasury to immediately prepare supplementary estimates to reduce expenditure by the amount of revenue that was expected to be generated by the rejected Finance Bill,” he said in a statement.

“The reduction in expenditure, amounting to Sh346 billion, will be borne equitably by both levels of government: the national and county governments. With respect to the national government, the reduction will be borne by the executive, the legislature, the judiciary, and our constitutional commissions,” added the head of State.

In his speech, while rejecting the Finance Bill on Wednesday, President Ruto had called for expenditure cuts to cover the expected shortfalls in revenues, including allocations to the Executive.

“I direct immediate further austerity measures to reduce expenditure starting with the Executive Office of the President and extending to the entire executive arm of government. I direct that operational expenditure in the Presidency be reduced to remove allocations for the confidential vote, reduce travel budget, hospitality and purchase of motor vehicles, renovations and other expenditures,” he said.

He also directed the National Treasury to immediately submit to Parliament amendments to the Division of Revenue Act 2024 to reflect the reduced revenues occasioned by the rejected Finance Bill.

President Ruto was forced to reject the Finance Bill following nationwide demonstrations that saw protesters breach Parliament Buildings even as clashes with police left 23 dead and scores injured.

Treasury circular

Meanwhile, the National Treasury Cabinet Secretary Njuguna Ndung'u sent a circular to all accounting officers on Friday directing them to limit spending by 15 percent of the Appropriated Budget until a mini-budget is developed and passed into law.

“Accounting officers are therefore directed to limit the spending of the FY 2024/25 Budget …to only critical and essential services,” said Prof Njuguna.","President William Ruto has directed the National Treasury to prepare a mini-budget for the fiscal year starting July after he rejected the Finance Bill 2024, which was expected to raise an additional Sh346 billion.

Among these, Kisspeptin-10, a decapeptide derived from the cleavage of the primary kisspeptin precursor, has emerged as a particularly notable molecule.

This article explores the potential functions and mechanisms of Kisspeptin-10 in biological systems, emphasising its hypothesised influence in reproductive physiology, metabolic regulation, and tumor suppression.

Kisspeptin-10 Peptide: Structural and biochemical characteristics

Kisspeptin-10, consisting of ten amino acids, is the shortest active form of the kisspeptins. Studies suggest that its structure allows it to bind effectively to the G-protein coupled receptor GPR54 (also known as KISS1R).

This receptor-ligand interaction is crucial for the peptide's biological activity.

Research indicates that the binding of Kisspeptin-10 to GPR54 may trigger a cascade of intracellular signalling pathways, primarily involving phospholipase C and the subsequent release of inositol triphosphate and diacylglycerol. These events may lead to an influence in intracellular calcium levels and the activation of protein kinase C, which are critical for the downstream impacts observed in various tissues.

Kisspeptin-10 Peptide: Reproductive physiology

One of the most extensively studied potential roles of Kisspeptin-10 is in regulating the hypothalamic-pituitary-gonadal (HPG) axis. It is hypothesised that Kisspeptin-10 might act as a potent stimulator of gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) secretion.

This, in turn, may influence the secretion of luteinising hormone (LH) and follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) from the anterior pituitary gland. These hormones are pivotal for regulating gonadal function, including steroid and gametogenesis.

Investigations purport that Kisspeptin-10 might play a critical role in the onset of puberty. It has been theorized that the increased expression of Kisspeptin and its receptor during this developmental stage might be a key trigger for the reactivation of the HPG axis, leading to the maturation of the reproductive system.

Moreover, Kisspeptin-10 is believed to regulate reproductive processes, potentially modulating the frequency and amplitude of GnRH pulses.

Kisspeptin-10 Peptide: metabolism

Beyond its reproductive functions, Kisspeptin-10 is also speculated to significantly affect metabolic processes. A growing body of data suggests that kisspeptins might be involved in regulating energy homeostasis.

Kisspeptin-10 is expressed in several regions of the brain that are known to be critical for metabolic control, including the hypothalamus. It is hypothesised that Kisspeptin-10 might influence appetite and food intake by interacting with other neuropeptides and hormones involved in energy balance, such as leptin and insulin.

Furthermore, studies suggest that Kisspeptin-10 might play a role in glucose homeostasis. Preliminary research indicates that Kisspeptin-10 might increase insulin secretion from pancreatic β-cells and improve insulin sensitivity in peripheral tissues.

These properties suggest that Kisspeptin-10 might have potential implications for managing metabolic disorders, such as obesity and type 2 diabetes, although more extensive studies are needed to fully understand these mechanisms.

Kisspeptin-10 Peptide: Tumors

Another intriguing aspect of Kisspeptin-10 is its potential role in tumor suppression. The KISS1 gene was initially identified as a metastasis suppressor gene in melanoma cells. Subsequent research has indicated that Kisspeptin-10 and its receptor might inhibit the metastatic spread of various cancers, including breast, prostate, and gastric.

It is hypothesised that Kisspeptin-10's anti-tumorigenic properties might be mediated through several mechanisms. For instance, Kisspeptin-10 is believed to cease cell migration and invasion by modulating the expression of matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs), enzymes that affect the extracellular matrix and facilitate tumor metastasis. Kisspeptin-10 might induce apoptosis and inhibit angiogenesis, contributing to its potential anti-cancer potential.

Kisspeptin-10 Peptide: Cardiovascular and neuroprotective research

Emerging data suggests that Kisspeptin-10 might also have protective parts in the cardiovascular and nervous systems. In the cardiovascular context, Kisspeptin-10 is expressed in the heart and blood vessels and is theorized to influence vascular tone and blood pressure regulation.

Studies suggest that Kisspeptin-10 might have vasoconstrictive impacts, which might be mediated through its interaction with the endothelial cells lining the blood vessels.

In the nervous system, Kisspeptin-10 is believed to exert neuroprotective impacts. It is hypothesised that Kisspeptin-10 might protect neurons from excitotoxic damage and oxidative stress, potentially by activating survival pathways such as the PI3K/Akt pathway. These properties might have implications in the context of neurodegenerative disorders, although further research is needed to elucidate the exact mechanisms involved.

Kisspeptin-10 Peptide: Conclusion

Investigations purport that Kisspeptin-10 is a multifaceted peptide with a wide range of potential biological functions. Its possible roles in reproductive physiology, metabolic regulation, tumor suppression, cardiovascular function, and neuroprotection highlight its importance in maintaining organismal homeostasis.

While significant progress has been made in understanding the mechanisms of Kisspeptin-10, many aspects of its functions and implications remain speculative and warrant further investigation. As research continues to uncover the complexities of this peptide, it may pave the way for novel strategies in various fields.

Please remember that none of the compounds mentioned in this paper have been approved for human or animal consumption.

The KRA data shows about six million people had filed their returns by June 26 against nine million active taxpayers on its database.

The six million figure is 20 percent more compared to a similar period last year.

Failure to meet the tax filing deadline is an offence which attracts an Sh2,000 fine or five percent of the individual's tax bill, whichever is higher. Companies pay Sh10,000 penalty or five percent of the tax payable in the year the return captures or whichever is higher.

“Six million taxpayers had filed their returns by June 26th. All taxpayers whose accounting period ends in December are required to file their returns by 30th of June every year,” said the taxman in a statement Thursday.

The KRA has been processing more than 100,000 filings daily, it reported on Thursday. Annually, the daily numbers are known to rise as the deadline approaches.

To allow more taxpayers to file their returns within the timelines, the taxman extended its working hours in all service centres countrywide and some Huduma Centres.

Filing returns has emerged as one of the taxman’s preferred ways to net tax cheats and grow the income tax segments amid struggles to meet collection targets.

The law requires anyone with a KRA personal identification number to file returns irrespective of employment status.

The taxman has failed to meet revenue targets in recent years on tax defaulters and a small tax base that does not include the majority of the self-employed and those working in the informal sector.

KRA recorded its highest shortfall in tax collections from employees in the first nine months of the current financial year which ends on June 30, despite introducing two tax bands targeting top earners.

A quarterly report published by the National Treasury shows that the KRA missed its pay-as-you-earn (PAYE) target by Sh72.3 billion in the period to March this year.

The taxman had a target of collecting Sh463.3 billion from salaries in the period ending March, but only raised Sh390.96 billion, which means it missed its target by 15.6 percent, the highest shortfall according to available data.

In the Finance Act 2023, the Income Tax Act was amended to introduce two individual tax bands.","About three million Kenyans had not filed their tax returns four days before the June 30 deadline, exposing them to penalties by the Kenya Revenue Authority (KRA).

Bolivia's President and former economy minister Luis Arce fended off the putsch on Wednesday but faces ongoing US dollar shortages and soaring borrowing costs that pushed the country's credit rating to ""junk"".

Kenya's President William Ruto, who reversed support for a tax-hike measure, now must find another path to make his nation's debt pile of some $80 billion more manageable.

Around the world, low-income nations were sucked into economic crisis - and in some cases, debt default - after the 2020 Covid-19 pandemic decimated parts of the global economy.





Now, the crisis is reverberating in Kenya, Bolivia and other middle-income nations bearing the brunt of a surge in inflation and the rapid global interest rate rises that followed the pandemic. Borrowing costs soared and Russia's war in Ukraine exacerbated a rise in prices of fuel and food.

""There are a lot of governments around the world all facing the pain, delayed fiscal pain, from the interest rate hikes that we've seen in recent years"" said Charlie Robertson, head of macro strategy with FIM Partners, which invests in emerging market debt.

""It's not a surprise that the country [Kenya] might reach a breaking point.""

At least 23 people died in Kenya as protests spiralled from online condemnations of the tax hikes into mass rallies demanding a political overhaul.

""It is not just the taxes,"" said Mary Ngigi, a 37-year-old clothing company worker in Kenya, on why she was protesting.

""When you go to the hospitals, there is no medicine. When you go to the schools, there are no infrastructures.""

Anger spreading

Turmoil is spreading. In Nigeria, workers protesting rising fuel and food costs caused a nationwide power outage, and leaders face rising subsidy costs despite tripling petrol prices last year.

Angola is also trying to cut subsidies, while Egypt is under pressure from the International Monetary Fund (IMF) for a slew of spending cuts and reforms that could cause more pain for citizens reeling from record-high inflation above 30 percent.

Risk intelligence firm Verisk Maplecroft warned that more subsidy cuts or tax hikes could serve as a trigger for unrest.

Argentina was roiled by huge general strikes in May against painful austerity measures and planned reforms by libertarian President Javier Milei, whose cost-cutting drive cheered investors but hammered the real economy.

Rising borrowing costs mean debt service gobbles a growing chunk of revenues. This puts pressure on countries, including Kenya, to raise taxes and cut spending.

In 2023, a record 54 developing countries, equivalent to 38 percent of the total, allocated 10 percent or more of government revenues to interest payments, with nearly half of them in Africa, according to a report from UN Trade and Development agency UNCTAD.

Multilateral banks and political risk firms have warned of a ticking time bomb for some time.

While debt relief efforts had centred on the poorest nations with solvency problems, and rightly so according to the World Bank, not enough had been done for lower middle-income countries facing temporary liquidity pressures in the near future.





""Without action, 2024 will see a further rise in debt vulnerability — potentially leading to reversals in development outcomes,"" World Bank senior managing director Axel van Trotsenburg warned.

Rising pain

Kenya, like others, borrowed heavily in the mid-2000s, when interest rates were low -- and China was splashing cash via its Belt and Road initiative to lend to emerging markets worldwide.

Over the past 20 years Kenya amassed some $82 billion of debt to build roads, railways and factories.

But not all ambitious projects were completed, and many Kenyans felt they had not benefited, while a slew of corruption scandals spurred allegations that elites enriched themselves.

""There is no cut on corruption,"" Boniface Mwangi, a prominent social justice activist in Kenya told Reuters. ""We have no problem paying debt, but...what did you do with that money that you borrowed?""

Ruto has said he is waging a war on corruption and has called for those responsible for graft to be prosecuted.

Kenya managed to avoid default by issuing more debt earlier this year - but at a punishing interest rate above 10 percent. After this week's protest, the country's bond prices slid again.

To keep crucial IMF cash coming, Ruto must find a way to balance the books.

""Kenya's government has a budget, and cash is not endless - so they need to prioritise,"" said Lutz Roehmeyer at Capitulum Asset Management.

The IMF, which warned Kenya to reverse ""fiscal slippage"", did not comment on whether it was asking for too much, but said in a statement that it was ""closely monitoring the situation.""

For Ruto -- and other leaders struggling to tame debt -- the path forward is far less clear after this week.","Deadly Kenyan protests that scuppered tax hikes and a failed coup amid fading economic prospects in Bolivia this week are violent reminders of the dangers posed by faltering economies and punishing austerity measures.
Kenya's President William Ruto, who reversed support for a tax-hike measure, now must find another path to make his nation's debt pile of some $80 billion more manageable.

Njau, who last worked as a journalist for Citizen TV, where he co-hosted the breakfast and accountability shows, died peacefully on Thursday night, his family said.

""It is with deep sadness that we inform you of the passing of our father. He left us peacefully on the evening of June 27, 2024, at 7 pm,"" his family said.

The late Mutegi had a distinguished media career that spanned decades, working with leading media houses but was popularly known for his morning show 'Cheche' on Royal Media Service.

His relatives described him as the cornerstone of the family and a cherished figure in the community whose generosity, sense of humour and dedication to his career left a lasting impact on everyone he met.

""Dad was a remarkable man whose generosity, sense of humour and dedication to his career left a lasting impact on everyone he met. He was not only the cornerstone of our family, but also a cherished figure in our community,"" read part of a statement from his family.

The family said they were in the process of making funeral arrangements and would announce details in the next day or two.

""Your presence would be greatly appreciated as we gather to honour his memory. Please keep our family in your thoughts and prayers at this difficult time. We are deeply grateful for your continued support and for the love and friendship you showed Dad throughout his life,"" they added.

He began his journey in the media in 1979, with his passion growing from the days of Kenya's founding president, Mzee Jomo Kenyatta.

Mutegi left Nation Media Group in 2005 after 24 years with the media house and later joined Citizen TV in 2006 where he worked until his retirement. He also served as chairman of the Media Associations Review Committee.

He also worked at other media houses, including the Kenya Broadcasting Corporation (KBC).

Several journalists have mourned Mutegi, with some describing him as a senior journalist who made his mark in the industry.

Head of Communication Services in the Office of the Deputy President, Njeri Rugene, eulogised Mutegi as a journalist who left an indelible mark on Kenyan journalism.

""Mutegi Njau has left an indelible mark on Kenyan journalism. He trained many of us. He left a rich legacy. It is time to rest. Rest in Peace Senior,"" said Ms Rugene, who was a long-serving editor at the Nation.

His former morning show co-host David Makali remembered Mutegi as a man who mentored and gifted many in the industry.

""I am devastated by the passing of my senior colleague, co-host and panellist Mutegi Njau. May your toil on this earth be rewarded and your memory live forever among those you mentored and gifted or who enjoyed your goodness,"" Makali said.

ODM Communications Director Philip Etale, who worked with Mr Njau in the newsroom, recalled how Mr Mutegi taught him the art of writing a good story and narrating events captured in the field.

""Etale, a good journalist writes facts and only facts. You don't need hearsay to be a good journalist, dig deeper and you will be incredibly successful in your career... RIP Mutegi Njau,"" he said.","Veteran journalist Mutegi Njau has died, his family has confirmed.

Entering the world of gold trading might seem intimidating to novices at first, but with a firm understanding of its fundamentals, one can embark on this rewarding journey with confidence.

In an effort to shed light on the mysterious world of gold trading, this article provides traders who are new to the game with helpful advice and methods.

Understanding the basics of gold trading

Buying and selling gold with the intention of making a profit is the core of the art of gold trading. In contrast to long-term gold storage under your mattress, trading is all about riding the waves of momentary price fluctuations.

There are several methods to become involved in this vibrant market: you may invest in gold futures, horde real gold like a pirate with coins and bars, ride along on gold ETFs (Exchange-Traded Funds), or even mine stocks.

Every route has its own set of hazards and tricks, so it pays to be aware of the terrain and choose your poison carefully depending on what makes your heart race and how much danger you can take.

Technical analysis: The foundation of gold trading

In gold trading, technical analysis is similar to detective work. It entails closely examining price charts to look for hints about potential future moves. These include determining trend lines, head and shoulders or double top patterns, and support and resistance levels.

Relative Strength Index (RSI), Bollinger Bands, and moving averages are examples of indicators that may be used as research instruments to provide information about possible price movements and market sentiment.

Gaining proficiency in technical analysis enables traders to accurately interpret market signals and make well-informed judgments for successful trading strategies.

The role of fundamental analysis

When it comes to gold trading, fundamental research is akin to penetrating the rich past concealed below the glossy exterior.

Finding the economic statistics, central bank policies, and international political dramas that drive up gold prices is the key. For example, be prepared for a stronger dollar and a possible decline in gold prices when the Fed suggests rising interest rates.

This is because gold loses value when other currencies gain value. Traders may anticipate changes in the market and adjust their strategies to optimize their earnings by analyzing these intricately linked narratives.

Developing a trading strategy

The secret to being an expert in gold trading is developing a solid trading plan. It's similar to planning a route: decide on the appropriate vehicle (trading instruments), pack for your comfort level (risk tolerance), and know where you're going (defined goals).

Managing risk is your compass, whether you're swinging slowly for a few days or running through the day. Put stop-loss orders in place to avoid risk and profit as soon as your goal comes into view. Adhere to your strategy religiously, and you will witness the glittering success of your trading career.

Utilising trading platforms and tools

For astute traders, modern trading platforms are a veritable treasure of tools and resources. Imagine having access to technical analysis tools, news feeds, and real-time price charts at your fingertips.

Demo accounts are similar to a practice run; they are ideal for novices to see the waters without jumping in too deep. Additionally, you may trade anytime, anywhere with mobile trading apps, which function like a portable trading desk. When you have these tools at your disposal, you're dealing wisely rather than merely for gold.

Psychological aspects of trading

Managing your emotions is just as important to success in the gold market as analyzing data. Imagine this: The fluctuations in the market have the power to arouse greed and anxiety more quickly than a rollercoaster.

You need a well-thought-out plan and a disciplined approach to stay consistent. Consider it as your mental fitness regimen, similar to preparing for a marathon: mindfulness and stress reduction. By maintaining your composure, you're learning the skill of emotional intelligence in trading, not only trading gold.

Legal and regulatory considerations

Keeping your capital secure and healthy is just as important as avoiding errors while navigating the legal environment of gold dealing. Consider it like being aware of the traffic laws prior to embarking on an exciting journey.

A plethora of bureaucracy exists in regulations, ranging from taxation and reporting to trading limitations and all in between. Remain educated and, when in doubt, get advice. By abiding by the regulations, you not only safeguard your nest egg but also contribute to the proper operation of the financial system.

Final thoughts

Starting a gold trading business is similar to going on a treasure hunt: it's thrilling and may be quite profitable.

You'll be able to confidently negotiate the ups and downs of the gold market by grasping the fundamentals, fusing technical expertise with fundamental understanding, and developing a solid trading strategy.

It's important to maintain composure while emotions are running high in addition to crunching data.","Throughout history, gold trading has solidified as a pillar of investment methods, providing a stable haven within the turbulence of unpredictable economic conditions.

Business Daily,https://www.businessdailyafrica.com/bd/lifestyle/profiles/ann-kinuthia-otieno-why-i-m-seen-as-a-woodpecker-4672076,2024-06-28,03:00:00 UTC,Ann Kinuthia-Otieno: ‘Why I’m seen as a woodpecker’,"Days before the gloom - the water cannons, and the young protesters shot in the head - Ann Kinuthia-Otieno, Chief Executive of Airtel Money walks onto the rooftop of Emara Ole Sereni in Nairobi. A petite lady, you can immediately tell she’s (to use an apt analogy of the moment) a bullet; straight-shooting, driven, and determined.

She left Absa Bank as a head of products to run Airtel’s mobile business after it split from Airtel Networks a few years ago to operate as a standalone business. And she comes at a tough time to do business—hell, tough time to just be alive—as a challenger brand. Even more daunting is that she faces a herculean task in the form of mobile money dominance.

Nonetheless, not one to complain, Ann’s been working her hide off. Over time, she has tripled the daily transaction limits and significantly reduced its pay bill, bulk payments, and wallet-to-bank charges. The subscribers of Airtel Mobile Money have gone up.

“Today people don’t think much about Airtel Money, but one day they will.” She promises. “We have covered good ground but the runaway is still long.”

[Earlier, we were discussing parenting before the interview officially commenced.]

You never know immediately the impact of your parenting until much later...

There is something growing up that influenced the person that you are today. And these things can either be taken positively or not. Generally, you never know, as a parent, if your decisions were the right ones...

Until the end…

Until the end. But again, I think there are cues that sometimes we don't take in or choose to ignore. So, for instance, I was in boarding school with my sister with whom I shared a birthday, the same month, same date, but we are two years apart. She's my elder. We were in State House Girls High School and my parents, for some reason, used to visit us and bring things in odd numbers for us to share. It was frustrating because if you bring seven items, someone will get less. But they let us figure it out ourselves. What that taught us is about sharing, being fair. But it didn’t come easy because you know how siblings can get. When I think about where my sense of fairness came from, it's from there.

What do you find harder; parenting or leadership?

Parenting. With children you have the pressure of creating a legacy, an impact that has implications on generations to come. It’s a big responsibility. The corporate world is different in that if I leave this job tomorrow, nobody will care about me. There will be someone else doing my job. With your children, it’s a different ball game because everything matters and it will shape their future.

What are you struggling with today?

My struggle today is Airtel Money. It’s a challenger brand that I need to grow. My late dad taught me a very important lesson that has stayed with me: whatever it is that you do, give it your very best so that nobody can come and do it after you. The sense of perfectionism comes from him.

Growing the brand is difficult, especially in a market where there's a dominant player and so that keeps me awake at night, thinking about what we can do to create impact and make a difference. I’ve been in the role for two years and every day I wake up to ask if I have made a difference. We have grown our customer base six times since I joined. It's been blood, sweat, and tears with the team.

What have you done lately that you were very proud of?

Professionally? The interoperability made possible with the help of the regulator, after five years, has enabled our customers to pay their bills online through the competitor’s paybill number.

On a more personal front, just the impact on my younger children’s lives - they are 10 and 12. Last year we had a bet with my two girls and I told them if they win academic awards, I would buy them a dog. And I don’t like dogs at all. I think they are good to look at from afar. Anyway, they both got academic awards. So we had to get a dog and it's growing on me. It's a golden retriever - very playful, very friendly. It’s destroying my flowers and I love gardening. It’s taught my girls more responsibility even though they cook for themselves and stuff. This morning the dog messed up my flowers again and one of them she said,""Maybe we can train the dog that it's not supposed to eat flowers"". I told her, ""You figure it out, it’s your dog"".

Are you living your life the way you want to?

I pray so, yeah, because you don't have two chances. And losing both my parents taught me that - even though they lived to their 70s - life is short. The key is to create an impact on my family and my job. My dad was very disciplined; everday, five in the morning, he was in the office. He had such a high level of integrity. He used to tell us, ""You should be like Caesar's wife; above reproach"". He was very passionate and I think I take after him.

I tend to be like a dog with a bone. I just go and refuse to give up. My boss says I'm like a woodpecker [Chuckles]. My mom was a teacher and after she retired, she started her school. She was hardworking and very friendly and extroverted. I got my father’s genes. I look like him as well. He died of cancer after fighting it for seven years. He used to tell us, ""If you choose any cancer, have leukaemia. He had MCL (mantle cell lymphoma). Mom's symptoms started showing three months before she died. They died three years apart.

Are you scared of cancer seeing as they both died of it?

Yeah, I mean, we all are, but you can't live life being scared. We all have to exit. The key thing is, what are you doing with the time that you have? What impact are you creating? Because at the end of the day, I believe God is just going to ask you, ""What have you done with the life that I've given you?"" My mom knew she had six months to live but she lived her life fully until the last day. So one has to live their life.

Do you see yourself in your 60s, which is traditionally when people slow down and retire?

I don’t think I will retire. I plan to keep my mind engaged. I worked in the banking sector for two decades and looked at corporate deals across Africa because I worked in South Africa for two years and then came back and looked after SMEs and then moved to retail. That’s a lot of learning and experience which I intend to use in consulting in my 60s. Maybe also sit on boards. I also love making social impact. God has given me so much and I shouldn't wait to be 60 to give back. It’s something I’m continually doing now outside work.

What do you do outside work, outside family?

Church. I’m passionate about making a difference. I got to the International Christian Centre. I was a deacon there at some point. Now my husband is a deacon. I also sit on a board at Pangani Girls. I head the Audit and Risk Committee.

When did you start serving the Lord?

When I was in Form two. I used to have these recurring dreams where the world was ending and I'd be rushing to church, only to be told it's too late. One evening, I felt a very strong sense of presence, and I knew it couldn't be ordinary. Nobody talked to me. Nobody. You know, the way people now say they were led to Christ and stuff like that. No. For me, it was just at that moment’s decision. I interpreted my dreams as a bigger calling that I heeded. Since then God has been a central part of my life. My leadership journey has been shaped by bibilical teachings. I constantly go back and read the Bible for encouragement in every sphere of my life.

Which is harder, leading people in church or at the workplace?

[Chuckles] Being a deacon is like being a board member. It’s an oversight role. People come to church to receive encouragement while in the office people’s job is to create returns for the shareholder. People in church are more forgiving and they will take you in stride. The corporate world is more challenging, and that's why you go to church, right? To get more encouragement. [Chuckles]

Did you meet Mr Otieno in church?

No, I met him when I was a corporate manager at Barclays, now Absa. So he's a financial consultant and there was a deal that he was doing and I was a corporate credit analyst. He's the deacon in the church, responsible for the finance docket.

What did you learn about his people that surprised someone like you who comes from a different tribe?

[Laughs] The unity of their family. Us Kikuyus can be individualistic sometimes. I think capitalism is very strong in Kikuyuland. I was surprised at the sense of unity in their village in Rongo, Migori. People just come to your home and are welcomed, people stay with each other…I found that very refreshing.

Business Daily,https://www.businessdailyafrica.com/bd/corporate/boss-talk/trific-ceo-brenda-mbathi-unveils-investment-plan-4672226,2024-06-28,03:00:00 UTC,Trific CEO Brenda Mbathi unveils investment plan after Two Rivers SEZ licence,"In June 2023, listed investment firm Centum received a special economic zone (SEZ) licence covering 64 of the 106 acres of its Two Rivers development in Nairobi.

A year down the road, the firm has announced a Sh6.1 billion funding package for the SEZ, which is known as the Two Rivers International Finance and Innovation Centre (Trific), from Africa-focused fund manager Vantage Capital.

Trific chief executive Brenda Mbathi spoke to the Business Daily on the company’s investment plan for the centre with the new capital injection, and the uptake of space at the facility over the past year.

How do you intend to deploy the new investment?

Out of the investment from Vantage Capital, Sh2 billion will be allocated for acquiring and fitting out the Trific North Tower. This 14,975 square metre property will serve as a cornerstone of our SEZ.

The remaining Sh4 billion will be used to develop an additional office tower offering 76,800 square metres of leasable space. This development will provide the necessary infrastructure to support the influx of SEZ enterprises and ensure we meet the demand for high-quality office space.

The design and functionality of the new tower will reflect our commitment to creating a world-class business environment, setting a new benchmark for commercial properties in the region.

What are the terms of the funding? Is it debt or equity investment?

The funding from Vantage Capital is structured as a mezzanine finance investment. This type of funding combines elements of both debt and equity, providing us with the capital required while being less dilutive to our shareholders than pure equity. It allows us to maintain a balanced financial structure, ensuring both stability and growth potential for Trific SEZ.

Mezzanine financing is particularly advantageous as it offers flexible terms and can be tailored to meet the specific needs of the project. This flexibility is crucial for large-scale developments like Trific SEZ, where capital requirements vary significantly.

By utilising this kind of finance, we can optimise our capital structure, manage risks more effectively, and ensure the sustainability of our growth plans.

How many enterprises or organisations have signed up to the EPZ and what are their business focus area?

To date, 14 SEZ enterprises have signed up and secured space in the Trific North Tower. These enterprises operate across various sectors, including business processing outsourcing (BPO), shared services centres, regional headquarters, and investment holding corporations. Collectively, these enterprises are expected to create approximately 10,000 jobs and attract foreign direct investment amounting to about $65 million. The space is currently 70 percent committed by these enterprises in the Trific North Tower.

What is your strategy for the SEZ now that you have the new funding?

The strategy is to leverage the new funding to enhance and expand our infrastructure, creating a more attractive and efficient environment for businesses.

Our strategic location within Nairobi’s prestigious diplomatic blue zone provides access to key markets and international business hubs. The SEZ framework in Kenya also offers various strategic incentives, including fiscal tax incentives, which are critical in reducing operational costs and enhancing profitability for businesses operating within Trific SEZ.

Trific SEZ, therefore, offers an ecosystem designed to provide businesses with a competitive edge. This includes world-class infrastructure, advanced technology, and a regulatory framework conducive to business growth.

By fostering an integrated live-work-play ecosystem, we aim to attract a diverse range of businesses and talent, ensuring they have the resources and support needed to thrive.

The Kenya Finance Bill 2024 has proposed to exempt property transfers within an SEZ from capital gains tax. What would be the impact of such an exemption on the competitiveness of Kenyan SEZs?

The exemption from capital gains tax on property transfers within an SEZ that was proposed in the Finance Act was essentially a clarification, as capital gains tax exemption is already allowed within the SEZ Act and it is a significant financial benefit for special economic zones.

This exemption creates a more attractive investment environment for current and potential SEZ enterprises. By reducing the financial barriers associated with property transfers, we can facilitate smoother and more efficient transactions, encouraging more businesses to establish and expand their operations within the SEZ space.

This financial flexibility is crucial in maintaining our competitive edge and ensuring the long-term success of SEZs in Kenya.","This development will provide the necessary infrastructure to support the influx of SEZ enterprises and ensure we meet the demand for high-quality office space.

Business Daily,https://www.businessdailyafrica.com/bd/economy/state-eyes-sh56bn-passport-immigration-fees-finance-bill-fail-4672238,2024-06-28,03:00:00 UTC,"State eyes Sh56bn passport, immigration fees after Finance Bill fail","The Treasury is targeting at least Sh55.8 billion from administrative fees and charges for services such as issuing national identity cards (IDs), passports, work permits and marriage certificates in the next financial year starting July, up from Sh28.3 billion in the current year.

The additional billions are crucial in a year when the State will struggle for additional cash after President William Ruto bowed to public demands to axe new tax measures contained in the controversial Finance Bill, 2024, which would have yielded Sh303 billion in fresh collections for the exchequer.

The fees will ride on anticipated increased demand for public services such passports and high charges implemented earlier this year.

The windfall is expected to boost funding of operations at respective ministries and State departments which have been looking to wean themselves off exchequer support.

The Treasury estimates appropriations in aid to total Sh426 billion in the 2024/25 financial year or about 12.7 percent of the total revenues, which are projected at Sh3.343 trillion.

New immigration visas and other consular fees are expected to generate Sh21.1 billion in collections from a previous estimate of Sh5.6 billion for the year ending June 30 and will represent the highest collections under administration charges.

Passport fees are meanwhile expected to generate Sh5 billion revenues in the fiscal year starting July 1, up from Sh3.2 billion previously.

Alien cards, which are mandatory for all foreign nationals residing in Kenya, now cost Sh5,000 effective from March 1 2024 from Sh1,000, while the penalty for failing to obtain a new alien card was revised from Sh1,000 to Sh10,000.

Applications to be a Kenyan citizen by marriage meanwhile cost Sh100,000 in contrast with Sh30,000 previously while East African nationals will fork out Sh50,000 from Sh5,000.

Ex-Kenyan citizens and residents wishing to get permanent residence pay a Sh50,000 application processing fee and Sh100,000 and Sh750,000 in permanent resident certificate issuance fees respectively.

The higher immigration fees, while boosting government collections, risk diluting Kenya’s status as a preferred destination for expats and multinationals.

Land adjudication and case fees are expected to rise at the fastest to Sh94.5 million, down from a conservative estimate of Sh291,585 previously.

Identity card fees and the registration of marriages are meanwhile expected to raise Sh3.4 billion and Sh253.2 million respectively, in contrast to Sh118.6 million and Sh168.8 million presently.

From January this year, the cost of a first-time ID application soared to Sh1,000 from no cost previously while duplicates or replacements now attract a fee of Sh2,000 from Sh100 previously.

With the changes in fees having been gazetted in November last year, the cost of obtaining an ordinary series A 34-page passport rose to Sh7,500 from Sh4,500 in 2023.

The Ministry of Interior indicated the charges had been adjusted to accommodate the views of the public following an earlier uproar that saw some prior notices revoked.

The ministry also cited funding pressures in its move to raise the essential fees and charges.

“The intended revised charges, fees and levies are informed by the need for Kenya’s self-reliance in financing the national budget, to wean the country from unsustainable debt that poses grave threats to our sovereignty and the dignity of future generations,” the ministry stated.

In a move to alleviate some of the public concerns, the ministry stated it would defray the costs of the revised charges on the acquisition of national IDs through a waiver for indigent Kenyans who demonstrate inability to pay.

Earlier on, the Ministry of Lands proposed to increase a number of service fees under a World Bank- backed revenue expansion plan.

Among the services targeted in the increase of up to 100-fold were the cost of an official land search and the cost of registering documents, including deeds of indemnity, agreements and trust deeds.

The Lands ministry said the revisions sought to harmonise some of the fees which it considered unreasonably low or unaligned to prevailing market rates.

At the same time, the ministry argued the revisions would help boost revenues outside of raising tax rates.","The fees will ride on anticipated increased demand for public services such passports and high charges implemented earlier this year.

Seacom said in an email response that the outage had been resolved and that normalcy had been restored by the early hours of Wednesday.

“A few of our corporate customers experienced degradation of their IP/MPLS services(Internet Protocol Multi-Protocol Label Switching) due to capacity lost on a few of the cables through which Seacom powers its corporate customers. The services were back to normal level in the early hours of Wednesday, 26 June,” stated the firm Thursday.

Router labels

IP MPLS is a routing system that enables fast data switching from one node to the next based on the assigned router labels.

Government sources that had earlier suggested that some alleged saboteurs keen to discredit the administration might have taken advantage of the situation to orchestrate infrastructural damages.

Broadcasting and Telecommunications Principal Secretary Prof Edward Kisiang’ani had in a phone interview on Wednesday told the Business Daily that the government was still yet to establish the real cause of the disruption.

“The disruption could have been brought about by a number of things but we’re still yet to establish and narrow down to the exact cause. It could be technical hitches but there could also be characters out there carrying out sabotage to discredit the government, which is very easy,” he said.

The IMF had asked the government to stand firm on new revenue-raising measures despite the protest as it assessed the risk as medium.

The multilateral lender’s assessment of the risk of pushback has escalated as street protests, led largely by the youth, turned deadly forcing President William Ruto to refer the Bill to Parliament with a recommendation to drop all clauses on Wednesday.

IMF in its latest report on Kenya had seen unrest arising largely from political opposition but asked the government to ‘remain committed’ to reforms under its programme.

“Unrest could re-emerge in connection with protests against higher cost of living, need to raise more taxes, and electoral process supported by the political opposition. Any deterioration in the security situation could disrupt trade and tourism,” the IMF indicated in the January report.

IMF had a similar premonition last year when Kenya lined up a new set of taxes after the High Court blocked the Finance Act of 2023.

The Kenya Kwanza administration came up with new measures including motor vehicle circulation tax, excise, and value-added tax (VAT) measures in a contingency plan to fund the then Sh3.68 trillion budget in the absence of new revenue-raising measures.

The Plan-B incidentally formed part of the originally submitted 2024 Finance Bill where the State for instance proposed introduction of a new motor vehicle circulation tax set at 2.5 percent of car valuations.

The National Treasury also proposed the clean-up of VAT-exempt and zero-rated lists which would have seen critical items such as bread attracting value-added tax at 16 percent.

The government has nevertheless been forced to pull the plug on the entire finance Bill after deadly street protests this week, ceding to public calls to reject the proposals.

Withdrawal of the Bill has put the government at loggerheads with the IMF which wanted the administration to follow through with the new tax measures notwithstanding opposing views.

Thursday, the IMF indicated it was monitoring the 2024 finance Bill fallout and that it remained committed to supporting Kenya.

“The IMF is closely monitoring the situation in Kenya. Our main goal in supporting Kenya is to help it overcome the difficult economic challenges it faces and improve its economic prospects and the well-being of its people,” IMF Director for Communications Julie Kozack noted in a statement.

The official said that the IMF was “deeply concerned” about events witnessed in Kenya in recent days leading to deaths, many injuries, and destruction of property.

“Our thoughts are with all the people affected by the turmoil in the country.”","The International Monetary Fund (IMF) foresaw emergence of street protests resisting controversial tax proposals which it backed, with the demos ending with withdrawal of the Finance Bill 2024.

The new health insurance company will be incorporated in Kenya and will be a subsidiary of the group through the company’s insurance holding company.

Equity Group is expected to provide initial capital to the new unit with the disbursement of Sh800 million for the share capital of the health insurance unit.

Shareholder nod clears the board of Equity Group to effect the incorporation of the new unit including providing approvals required from the company as the sole shareholder in the Insurance Holding Company.

Equity Group Insurance Holding Limited already undertakes a life insurance and general insurance business in Kenya.

In the year ended December 2023, Equity’s insurance business realised Sh1.6 billion in gross revenue with 9.9 million cumulative policies issued.

The lender started its life business in 2022 and offers life insurance alongside retirement solutions to all categories of customers.

The unit known as Equity Life Assurance Kenya realsed a profit before tax growth of 39 percent to Sh934 million.

Equity Group expects to start rolling out insurance products for both its health and insurance categories later this year as the bank steps up its business diversification into new segments.

The lender's shareholders have also given their approval to the creation of a new banking holding company which is set to consolidate the activities of all banking subsidiaries within the group.

Equity Group is now set to operate under four groups including; the Banking Group, Insurance Group, Technology Group, and Foundation Group.

Equity Group operates banking subsidiaries in Kenya, Uganda, Tanzania, South Sudan, Rwanda, and the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC).

The shareholders have also ratified the payment of Sh15.1 billion in dividends or a payout of Sh4 per share representing the payout for the period ended December 31, 2023.

The dividend payment matches the payout made at the end of 2022 despite the bank recording a 6.48 percent dip in net profit to Sh41.98 billion on higher provisions for expected bad loans.","The new health insurance company will be incorporated in Kenya and will be a subsidiary of the group through the company’s insurance holding company.

The company, which has partnered with the national hoteliers’ lobby Kenya Association of Hotelkeepers and Caterers (KAHC), said it has stepped up investments in its product value chain to ensure customers get value for their money.

Mr Joseph Muguongo, Brookside’s general manager for sales, said the processor plans to drive product sales with eyes on a bigger slice of the local dairy market.

“The business partnership with hoteliers seeks to further enhance our market share in the dairy products category. Hotels and catering outlets in the country constitute a core sales segment in our market consolidation strategy, and we will continue to prioritise supply orders from hoteliers countrywide,” Mr Muguongo said in Diani, Kwale County during the KAHC annual symposium Thursday.

KAHC membership mainly comprises star-rated hotels, restaurants, lodges, tented camps, and residential cottages, all big consumers of dairy products.

Business Daily,https://www.businessdailyafrica.com/bd/corporate/companies/huge-debts-choking-efforts-to-revive-distressed-companies-4672074,2024-06-28,01:00:00 UTC,Huge debts choking efforts to revive distressed companies,"Kenya’s financially distressed companies are grappling to secure a lifeline through ‘administration’ owing to their debts and late implementation of recovery measures, which pushed them into liquidation.

An administration process involves appointing an administrator to run a distressed company for one year with a possibility of extension by the court or selling it as a going concern to enhance its value for the benefit of its creditors.

Placing a firm under administration helps to regain control when it has serious cash flow problems, is insolvent, and faces threats from creditors. This helps to rescue the company as a going concern, achieve better results for creditors or control, and then sell off its property.

Data by the Office of the Official Receiver shows petitions for company liquidations are on the rise and have hit 30 since July 2023, highlighting the extent of financial distress facing businesses due to economic downturn and governance-related issues.

Administrators say keeping distressed companies as a going concern is becoming difficult because of debts that cannot be repaid within the ‘administration period’ of up to 18 months, citing the collapsed retail chain Nakumatt that went under with an estimated Sh38 billion worth of claims.

Liquidation (or winding up) is the process by which a company’s existence is terminated by selling its assets to pay off its debts. Any money remaining after all debts, expenses, and costs have been paid off is distributed among the company’s shareholders.

Since the introduction of the administration process in 2015, Nakumatt Holdings Ltd, ARM Cement Plc. and Deacons Plc were the first to go through the process, with hopes that their recovery would set a positive trend for other companies likely to undergo the same process.

However, these companies failed to survive the administration process, paving the way for their liquidation.

“These companies are heavily indebted. They can’t come out of that big hole. So, what we have been doing is trying to sell those assets to somebody who can buy them and put them to use because you find that by the time the company has gone that route, it can take them long to recover. I give an example of Nakumatt with Sh38 billion debt, which you can’t expect to recover. No bank will give you more money to pay that,” says Peter Kahi, a partner at PKF Consulting (K) Ltd.

“So we look at options. The first option is to see whether we can rescue that company, the second option is to try and maximise the returns for all creditors so that at least they get something, and if you can’t achieve the third option is to sell the assets to pay for preferential creditors and other claims. Most administrators have been going for option two or option three.”

The number of petitions for liquidation of companies presented to court has more than doubled in the last nine years. Even after the new Insolvency Act (2015) introduced a provision for an ‘administration process’ to give a chance to financially troubled firms to put their houses in order and revert to the recovery path.

Petitions for liquidations by the court rose to 30 in the 2023-24 fiscal year (July-June) from 13 petitions in the 2015-16 fiscal year (July-June), while the number of companies pushed into voluntary liquidation increased to nine from five in the same period.

About 22 companies were put under liquidation through direct appointment in the 2023-24 financial year, according to the Office of the Official Receiver.

“I can say these companies don’t go into liquidation but somebody else comes to make better use of their assets because if you continue running that company how many years will it take you to pay off Sh38 billion debt because the administrators’ period is 12 months with the first extension of maybe six months and that is what the law says,” says Mr Kahi.

Ken Gichinga, a Chief Economist at Mentoria Economics, says recovery of companies under administration requires a combination of administration and managerial expertise to be able tackle deal with problems related to the weak macroeconomic environment and the ‘trust deficit’ reputation crisis occasioned by the ‘receivership’ tag.

“Companies in receivership have to fight two battles which are a weak economic environment and the trust deficit battle associated with the high risk profile of companies in receivership. So you will find that the appointed administrators of these companies (in administration) end up fighting two battles instead of one battle and that is the reason it has been that hard to revive these companies,” says Mr Gichinga.

“ From the word ‘administrator, the administrators’ main concern is to keep the companies in administration as a ‘going concern’ but what these companies really need is almost a double level of management trend to be able to navigate this weak macroeconomic environment and to win the confidence of the customers. What we need is administrators working together with management gurus to revive these companies.”

Administrators say that normally they are called upon when companies are in the ‘intensive Care Unit (ICU)’ with nothing to salvage as most assets have been stripped by the directors. These companies are going through a crisis in which they cannot meet their debt obligations, salaries are in arrears, auctioneers are calling at the doors of the company, the tax man is calling and critical supplies such as electricity have been disconnected.

“There are three objectives of any administration. Reviving a company is the first and depends to a large extent on the state of the company at the point of the intervention,” George Weru, a Business Recovery Partner at PricewaterhouseCoopers (PwC) said in an earlier interview.

“If the intervention is too late when the distress is very significant this is not practical. The administrator proceeds to the next objective which is to sell the business as a going concern. This ensures continuity of the business and saves jobs which to me is still a success.”

Under the Insolvency law, a company is deemed unable to pay its debts if it fails to pay a debt of Sh100, 000 or more after 21 days of a written demand being served upon it.

According to a law firm Maina & Onsare Partners Advocates LLP the process of administration is intended to offer breathing space for insolvent companies while availing better returns and packages for creditors which are not ordinarily available in liquidation.

“It also gives Companies going through financial turmoil an opportunity to put their acts together. This allows them to continue operating instead of the earlier practice of abruptly killing them as was the case in the previous statutes (now repealed),” the law firm says on its website.

“It is an alternative rescue process which leads to a stay of past and future legal proceedings as envisaged by Section 560 & 561 of the Insolvency Act hence making it cheaper for the company.”

Up until 2015, a company in financial distress was met often with the liquidation culture triggered by voluntarily or by a creditor or subject to the court's supervision.","This helps to rescue the company as a going concern, achieve better results for creditors or control, and then sell off its property.

The pan-African housing financier last made a profit in 2021, when it posted Sh233 million ($1.8 million) net earnings, after making losses for six consecutive years since 2015, amid falling revenue as its loan book thinned and non-performing loans soared.

In the financial year ending December 2023, the financier, which recently rebranded into a development bank, recorded a surge in revenue as its NPLs dropped by about 2.5 percent amid increased recovery efforts.

“Mortgage borrowers have faced increased repayment burdens, resulting in a slowdown in housing activity and declining home prices globally,” said Shelter Afrique’s board of directors chairperson Chii Akporji.

“Despite challenges, Shelter Afrique has made significant strides. The transformational initiatives undertaken by Management have led to improved financial performance, with a break-even financial position achieved in 2023.”

Based on the continental lender’s financial results published this week, its 2023 total income rose 94 percent to Sh2.2 billion ($16.9 million) from the Sh1.1 billion ($8.7 million) they recorded in 2o22.

Its net earnings from interest on loans more than doubled to Sh2 billion ($15.2 million), up from Sh954.6 million ($7.4 million) in 2022, largely driven by a surge in its recovery of loans, as its own interest expense registered a marginal rise.

Last year, the lender recovered a total of Sh1.8 billion ($13.7 million) in bad loans, both from cash collections and asset takeovers, bringing down its NPLs to gross loans ratio to 51 percent, from 53.5 percent in 2022.

However, it also wrote off Sh2.5 billion ($19.1 million) in bad loans in 2023 alone, highlighting the magnitude of the lender’s struggle with non-performing loans, which currently constitute over half of its loan book.

The lender says the high rate of NPL ratio is because “the rate of closing new transactions is still slower compared to the repayments of the performing book,” despite increasing efforts to expand its loan book.","Shelter Afrique has rebounded from a Sh1.5 billion ($11.7 million) loss to post a profit of Sh128 million ($994,049) – the second positive net earnings in over seven years – following a rise in revenues and a drop in non-performing loans (NPLs).

Analysis of the regional deals landscape by investment advisory firm I&M Burbidge Capital shows that the disclosed value of deals this year stands at $952 million (Sh123 billion), compared to $1.47 billion (Sh189.6 billion) in the first five months of 2023--marking a 35.12 percent drop.

In Kenya, where the majority of regional deals are domiciled, the first quarter of the year saw the shilling weaken to historic lows, partly on account of uncertainty over whether the country would be able to repay a maturing $2 billion sovereign bond.

Inflation was also elevated coming into the new year, but like the shilling exchange rate, it has since then moderated after the Central Bank of Kenya raised its base lending rate.

Exchange rate volatility, however, remains a concern in Uganda and Tanzania, and the high interest rates in Kenya are also hurting capital access for the private sector in Kenya.

“The regional macroeconomic picture remains mixed, with negative cyclical headwinds from high interest rates, concerns over debt distress, unfavourable fiscal policy, and currency volatility in Tanzania and Uganda pitted against positive cyclical and structural tailwinds including a favourable inflation trend, currency stability in Kenya,” said I&M Burbidge Capital in its May 2024 East Africa financial review.

“This backdrop leads us to the conclusion that whilst we maintain our expectation for continued investor interest in the region, we expect higher diligence and return requirements and as a result longer transaction completion timelines”

I&M Burbidge Capital tracks deals every month in Kenya, Uganda, Tanzania, Rwanda, and Ethiopia, segregating them according to sectors and the type of institutions involved.

In the review period, investments by Development Financial Institutions (DFIs) accounted for the highest value of deals at $647 million (Sh83.6 billion), followed by mergers and acquisitions ($168.3 million/Sh21.7 billion), venture capital deals ($73.6 million/Sh9.5 billion) and private equity ($63.2 million/Sh8.1 billion).

In terms of the number of deals, venture capital (VC) led at 25, followed by mergers and acquisitions at 12, private equity (PE) at 10, and DFI at nine.

The low disclosed value relative to the number of deals by VC and PE indicates that many of the transaction values were kept private. It also shows that they have lower ticket prices per deal compared to DFI and merger/acquisition transactions.

Regarding geographical distribution of deals, Kenya accounted for 40 out of the region’s total of 59 deals, followed by Uganda at seven deals, Rwanda and Tanzania at five deals each, and Ethiopia at two transactions.","The disclosed value of deals in East Africa fell by more than a third in the first five months of the year compared to the corresponding period in 2023 on investor caution due to macroeconomic headwinds, including currency volatility and high inflation.

The first auction targets Sh20 billion and closes on July 4 while the second runs until July 17 and seeks to raise the balance of Sh30 billion.

Investors in the tap sale are set to get a return of 17.1225 percent and will pay a premium of Sh106.3186 for every Sh100 or the par value with the interest rate earned from the tap sale being locked in from the paper’s last issuance.

The yield is still a premium to the 16.9723 percent rate of return achieved during the paper’s first issuance last year or the coupon rate.

The CBK will, meanwhile, seek to bring investor bids close to the return of 16 percent and 13.75 percent achieved in the first issuance of the re-opened 10 and 20-year papers.

The 10-year paper was first issued in February this year and had a fixed rate of return contrary to regularly issued bonds whose return is usually market determined.

The paper signaled CBK’s quest to bring down interest rates on government securities even as its push is derailed by expensive bids from investors.

Investors continue to demand a premium to hold government bonds in the stay of high interest rates and increased domestic borrowing by the State.

The target for domestic borrowing in the financial year closing June 30 has, for instance, been raised in the backdrop of the widened fiscal deficit to Sh908.6 billion from Sh718.9 billion.

Government plans to reset the deficit downwards to Sh597 billion in the financial year starting July 1 have been put on hold in the face of a withdrawn 2024 Finance Bill that contained new taxation measures to increase domestic revenues and proposed changes to spending plans for the same period.

Treasury Cabinet Secretary Njuguna Ndung'u had proposed domestic borrowing across the 2024/25 financial year at Sh263.2 billion while the target for external financing is Sh333.8 billion.

CBK has been betting on a lower fiscal deficit and a smaller domestic borrowing target to bring down interest rates on government securities as the lower target discourages the push for higher returns by investors.

Proceeds from the July bond auctions will represent the first nettings of the 2024/25 financial year domestic borrowing target.

This month, the CBK closed its borrowing programme by mobilising Sh84.8 billion against a target of Sh80 billion after bond sales covering reopened two, three, five, and 10-year papers.","Investors continue to demand a premium to hold government bonds in the stay of high interest rates and increased domestic borrowing by the State.

Business Daily,https://www.businessdailyafrica.com/bd/economy/state-non-debt-spending-rises-at-fastest-pace-in-six-years-4671914,2024-06-28,00:00:00 UTC,State’s non-debt spending rises to Sh1.1trn at fastest pace in six years,"The cost of running government has grown at the fastest pace in six years, signaling a rising burden on taxpayers to keep public offices operating and reversing President William Ruto’s earlier gains in taming growth in day-to-day expenditures.





The Ruto administration spent slightly more than Sh1.1 trillion on salaries and wages, administration, operation, and maintenance of offices in 11 months through May 2024, according to the latest figures from the National Treasury.

The 14.12 percent climb over Sh975.12 billion in a similar period a year earlier is the biggest growth since the financial year 2017-18 when Kenya conducted historic repeat presidential elections.

The non-debt recurrent expenditures grew at a double-digit rate despite Dr Ruto’s pledge upon taking power in September 2022 to institute a raft of expenditure savings to ease the burden of funding government operations and administration.

The president’s policy of keeping a tight lid on cost of administrative and maintenance, while driving expansion in tax compliance rates, appeared to be bearing fruit after recurrent expenditure dropped a marginal 4.44 percent to Sh975.12 billion.

“The Kenyan government had initially made good progress in tackling the poor public finances,” Jason Tuvey, deputy chief emerging markets economist at UK-based Capital Economics, wrote in a note on Kenya this week.

“There have been signs of fiscal slippage recently, though, as spending has increased and revenues have underperformed. That spurred the government, in the 2024/25 Budget, to outline a raft of tax increases in a bid to get its fiscal consolidation plans back on track.”

The Treasury data shows taxes grew at a slower rate of 10.83 percent year-on-year to Sh1.93 trillion than that in non-debt recurrent expenditure in the 11 months ended May.

The Ruto administration’s plan to make up for slower growth in taxes than expenditure through Finance Bill 2024 was this week thwarted by youth-led demonstrators who poured onto the streets of cities and major towns countrywide saying additional taxes will exacerbate an already unbearable cost of living.

Dr Ruto was banking on the new taxes which targeted Sh346 billion in new revenue and expenditure cuts largely targeting non-essential expenditures such as hospitality and renovation of offices as well as slashing allocations for Semi-Autonomous Government Agencies to place the country on the path to a balanced budget by year 2027.

Analysts have, however, insisted that Kenya has an “expenditure problem and not a tax problem”, indicating that the government needs to tame its spend further to achieve a balanced budget where borrowing is kept at minimal levels.

International Budget Partnership's Country Manager for Kenya Abraham Rugo has cited supplementary budgets to cater for expenses that were not initially budgeted as the main driver of non-debt expenditures.

“Governments are meant to exist and deliver services perpetuity which means that as the size of government grows, recurrent expenditures are likely to increase indefinitely,” Dr Rugo said.

Business Daily,https://www.businessdailyafrica.com/bd/corporate/companies/court-directs-liquidation-of-blueshield-insurance-4671894,2024-06-28,00:00:00 UTC,Court directs liquidation of Blueshield Insurance,"Blueshield Insurance Company will now be liquidated after a judge agreed with the Insurance Regulatory Authority (IRA) that the underwriter cannot be resuscitated.

High Court Judge Alfred Mabeya spelt the death knell of the underwriter saying there was no evidence that shareholders were willing to inject any capital in the company to make its capital ratios compliant and the verified liabilities, in excess of Sh800 million still stare at the firm.

“A liquidation order is hereby made against Blueshield Insurance Company,” said Justice Mabeya.

Liquidation (or winding up) is the process by which a company's existence is terminated by disposing of its assets to settle debts. Any monies remaining after all debts, expenses, and costs have been paid off are distributed among the company's shareholders.

An application by the commissioner of IRA, Mr Godfrey Kiptum, had been opposed by Ms Beth Muigai and Ms Jean Ngengi arguing that there were still hope of reviving the company arguing that liquidation was draconian.

Blueshield was incorporated in December 4, 1982, and all was well until September 2011 when it was placed under receivership and Eliud Muchoki appointed the statutory manager, who served from September 15, 2011 to July 4, 2014.

Mr Kiptum informed the court that the company could not fulfil the reasonable expectations of policyholders and its shareholding and board structure were not in compliance with the Insurance Act.

He said the insurer had issues with compliance with respect to the non-remittance of contributions to the Policy Holder’s Compensation Fund, non-payment of premium levies as well as non-remittances to the Insurance Training and Education Trust.

And despite being placed under statutory management, the company was unable to fulfil the reasonable expectations of the policyholders.

Mr Kiptum added that the company did not have the required capital to support its day-to-day trading operations.

He said the verified liabilities were more than Sh855 million, which included court judgements, executed discharge vouchers, and service provider vouchers.

The court was informed that the Policy Holders Compensation Fund Board of Trustees had recommended the winding up of the company in its report of February 2017.

In an affidavit, the managing trustee of the Fund Mr William Masita said the company was experiencing continued financial and operational difficulties resulting to its shrinking in business, resources, and ability to meet its contractual obligations.

He added that the shareholders had failed to honour several undertakings and the company remained insolvent thus unable to operate as an insurer.

Mr Masita said it was in the best interest to have an insolvency order issued and a provisional liquidator appointed to ensure the orderly distribution of assets of the company.","Blueshield Insurance Company will now be liquidated after a judge agreed with the Insurance Regulatory Authority (IRA) that the underwriter cannot be resuscitated.

The cat who designed the interior of the Wine Bar, Lavington, should have a beer on us. (“Us” being anybody who rejected the Finance Bill). I say this because there is a feeling you get when you walk in there, through all those shelves upon shelves of bottles of wine. It’s like walking through an aquarium of alcohol.

You feel giddy with anticipation even if you don’t care too much about wine. Maybe this feeling is further complemented by the usage of wood. And lighting. It’s all in the simplicity and the flow. Anyhow, whatever it is, a beer to the interior stylist.

I recently sat with a friend in one of those raised tables inside, the one facing the short bar and the back entrance. Cosy little corner, too cosy to be wasted discussing politics. My friend is a typical middle-class who has never teared up from teargas but complains about the state of our governance. She also feels like going to protest is too “dangerous.” That tear gas might get into her hair. (Great hair, I will admit).

This is a malady that has afflicted us and our parents; taking it on the chin, turning the other cheek. It was my first ever protest and after that, I was calling out all my friends who think protests are for “other people.” I realise that I was quite insufferable.

Anyway, Wine Bar (no fault of theirs) felt like the kind of place people who have never sniffed teargas would gather to talk about teargas and violence. It’s safe and cosy and gorgeous. The staff/sommeliers are friendly and helpful and if you love wine and you have the ambition to go to heaven then you will wonder if that’s not heaven already.","The cat who designed the interior of the Wine Bar, Lavington, should have a beer on us.

The Uganda National Oil Company (Unoc), in a circular to oil marketing companies (OMCs), said it will ship fuel cargoes for oil firms without affiliates in Kenya, starting with the maiden shipments that are expected at the Mombasa port next week.

“For OMCs without affiliate logistics partners, Unoc will handle loadings on behalf of these OMCs in the Kenya Pipeline Company system,” Unoc told the OMCs in the circular this week.

Unoc’s move is set to hit local OMCs that have for decades been dealing in the fuel transit business to Uganda, which is the biggest transit market for fuel imported through Kenya’s Open Tender System (OTS) and now the government-backed deal.

Uganda will on July 2 end decades of relying on Kenya for her fuel needs, after Unoc signed a five-year deal to directly import fuel from Vitol Bahrain.

This means that Unoc is now only dealing with Ugandan OMCs who are at liberty to nominate their affiliate Kenyan partners.

The apex bank said it is pushing for the larger role noting that not all credit providers fall under the ambit of regulated entities at present.

CBK Governor Kamau Thugge said he has made submissions to the National Assembly Finance and National Planning Committee seeking to move changes to the CBK Act through future legislation including a Miscellaneous Amendment Act.

“We have submitted some amendments touching on digital credit providers’ clauses on the CBK Act to move away from digital credit to credit because a lot of the businesses that provide credit are not always digital,” he said in an interview.

The CBK has meanwhile issued permits to seven more digital credit providers (DCPs).

The new licensees who have been waiting for the regulator’s nod since late 2022 include car-log book loans provider Mogo Auto Limited, Ismuk Credit Limited, Mint Credit Limited, Payablu Credit Limited, Progressive Credit Limited, Stride Credit Limited, and ED Partners Africa Limited.

The CBK has received more than 550 applications for licenses since March 2022 and notes that it has been working closely with the applicants in reviewing their applications.

The approval process has however been lengthy as the CBK undertakes intense interrogation of the applicants’ business models, consumer protection, and fitness and propriety of proposed shareholders, directors, and management.

Digital lenders have sought CBK’s guidance on the documents required to unlock the more than 400 pending applications. CBK has only approved 10.5 percent of DCPs who applied for licenses or 58 entities out of more than 550 applications submitted.

Applications by firms seeking to enter the digital lending space have increased to more than 550 from 480 previously as of March when the banking sector regulator handed 19 new DCPs licenses. CBK gazetted the Digital Credit Providers regulations in 2022 requiring all digital lenders to apply for licenses before September of the same year.

DCPs are required to make disclosures on interest rates charged, and terms of credit to borrowers and sign off on a provision barring them from sharing information of loan defaulters with third parties.

The regulation of DCPs by the CBK seeks to bring sanity into an industry previously plagued by predatory lending and debt shaming.","The Central Bank of Kenya (CBK) wants an expanded mandate to oversee all credit providers, pushing its grip beyond commercial banks and microfinance institutions.

The Guardian,https://www.theguardian.com/politics/article/2024/jun/29/disbelief-as-us-uk-trade-deals-under-threat-after-britain-axes-negotiators,2024-06-29,20:09:34 UTC,‘Disbelief’ as US-UK trade deals under threat after Britain axes negotiators,"America was meant to be Britain’s route to the sunlit uplands of Brexit. Then, after hopes of a free trade deal evaporated, successive Conservative governments have set their sights lower, by trying to forge closer ties with individual US states.

Now the civil servants responsible for delivering those state-level deals have been let go, in what a furious British businessman described as “an act of arson”.

Nearly a seventh of trade posts within British consulates in the US have been axed, with 24 people losing their jobs, 18 from 139 posts in the trade department. The decision was taken barely two weeks before Rishi Sunak called the general election.

Many of the trade teams, based in the nine consulates across the US, had worked on trade pacts with Kemi Badenoch, the business and trade secretary, jetting around America to sign memorandums of understanding with governors of states including Florida, Indiana and Oklahoma.

But more importantly, according to British business leaders in the US, the regional trade directors and their staff had decades of experience and had built up contacts with American businesses from Google and Meta to the heads of Hollywood studios.

Jules Ehrhardt, a designer and investor, said there was “outrage and disbelief in the British business community” at the decision.

“They are tossing out collective centuries of relational and institutional knowledge core to the UK-US trading relationship,” he said. Ehrhardt moved to the US in 2012 to open the American arm of Ustwo, a digital design studio behind award-winning games such as Monument Valley, and worked with Google, Nike and Twitter, before founding a venture capital firm, FKTRY.

He said the consulate directors had “served as the connective tissue” between British and American business leaders, making introductions, giving advice and lending their expertise. “We shot ourselves in both feet by undermining Britain’s ‘gateway to Europe’ status for American companies following Brexit, and were told to go west, and now we’ve self-elected a lobotomy,” Ehrhardt said.

“This [is an] act of arson in the final stages of this government. We claim it is a special relationship, yet remove our people at the very heart of it.”

Allan Rooney, founder of Rooney Law, which has helped more than 300 companies from the UK, Ireland and Australia enter the US market, said the directors were “absolutely critical in building strong and mutually beneficial trade relationships between UK and US businesses”.

“The facilitation of strategic introductions that these directors provide is a massive benefit,” he said. “They plug companies into a market they otherwise don’t know anything about. They familiarise them via trade missions and other methods to support and understand the market and the subtle differences between the UK and the US ‘doing business’ culture. Removing that layer will impact trade relations.

“More than a million Brits are employed by American businesses – I can’t think of a more important trade relationship post-Brexit. It’s critical. And I think the removal of a very large swathe of intellectual capital and institutional knowledge is potentially worrisome. It could strain the trade teams who are already short on resources.”

Another US-based British business executive said that there was very little stability in the UK’s consulates because they were usually staffed by Foreign & Commonwealth Office officials who stayed in the US for four-year periods. “It’s a constant revolving door,” the executive said. “Those are the people we lean on.”

William Bain, head of trade policy at the British Chambers of Commerce, said: “If we want to grow our economy then we need to boost trade, so it’s a concern if cuts are being made to the team supporting key export sectors in the US, our second largest trading partner.

“We need to scale up, not slash, our support for companies seeking to enter or raise market share in the US. This is especially true as we hope to see deals on critical minerals and digital trade reached with the US federal government in the next year or so.”

Boris Johnson, Liam Fox and other Brexiters had hoped that signing a trade deal with the US would provide economic growth for the UK, but Johnson failed to persuade either Donald Trump or Joe Biden. Last June, Rishi Sunak signed an “Atlantic declaration” with Biden which allowed UK firms access to some US subsidies.

State-level deals have seen some recognition of British professional qualifications and removed some regulatory barriers.

A UK government spokesperson said: “The UK’s trade and investment teams in America are fully focused on furthering UK interests in the US, driving investment and strengthening our trading relationship with our closest ally. We continually keep our structures under review to ensure they deliver maximum impact for the UK, ensure the highest quality service to businesses, while offering taxpayers the very best value for money.”","Nearly a seventh of trade posts within British consulates in the US have been axed, with 24 people losing their jobs, 18 from 139 posts in the trade department.

The Guardian,https://www.theguardian.com/politics/article/2024/jun/30/uk-and-eu-horticulture-firms-warn-of-harm-caused-by-post-brexit-border-delays,2024-06-30,17:13:36 UTC,UK and EU horticulture firms warn of harm caused by post-Brexit border delays,"Nurseries and garden centres across Britain and Europe have warned that new post-Brexit border posts are not working properly and are leading to delays, damage and significant extra costs for importers bringing plants into Britain.

The Horticultural Trade Association, which represents 1,400 garden retailers and growers in the UK, has joined forces with several European trade bodies to write an open letter to call for urgent solutions, warning the new system was adding more than 25% to import costs.

It said the checks introduced in April had held up a significant number of deliveries at the border, sometimes for as long as 44 hours, while difficulties carrying out inspections were increasing the chance of harmful pests and plant diseases entering Britain.

The new rules mean certain plant and animal products coming into Britain from the EU must now be checked at border posts situated in or nearby British ports. Previously, plants were inspected in spot checks once they had reached nurseries.

The trade bodies said the new system is causing delays and piling on costs. One haulage company said it experienced 93 hours of driver waiting time in the first week of the checks, costing it £38,000 in extra pay.

The company calculated that this would add £1.5m to its logistics bill over the next year, an increase of 25%.

Another company reported three of its trailers filled with plants were held at a border post for 44 hours after a software problem. This resulted in the majority of plants dying or wilting and the loads being rejected by the end customer.

The letter was signed by International Flower Trade Association, whose membership accounts for 80% of the total value of worldwide trade of flowers and pot plants, as well as VGB, the Dutch association of wholesalers in floricultural products.

It comes as importers are already having to deal with increased costs on moving plant and animal products to Britain because companies are now charged for inspections of goods at the border.

The letter said in some cases providers could be paying £1,740 extra to bring in a mixed load of 12 different consignments of plants, making trade unviable for many small businesses.

Under the new Brexit rules, plants for planting have been categorised as high-risk, meaning much higher rates of inspection than for businesses that import meat and dairy, which are classified as medium risk.

Importers claim the posts are too small to process goods from multiple lorries, and they said there is insufficient equipment at nearly all facilities to unload plants such as large trees or those large plants not stacked into plant trolleys.

Before the checks came in April, imported plants were held at nurseries and farms in controlled conditions before checks on site by government inspectors.

Under the new rules these checks take place almost exclusively at both government-run and privately run border posts. The government has insisted that this would enhance the country’s biosecurity by stopping harmful diseases entering the country and damaging plants and crops.

However, the letter raised concerns about the standard of checks at border posts.

It claimed loads were being “observed, rather than intensely scrutinised”, which was increasing the chance of diseases being missed, while the lack of information on what was being checked was leaving some end customers in the dark about the health of plants they received.

In one case, checks on a load of 50 mature olive trees were abandoned because of difficulties unloading. The letter said: “Olive trees are a well-known host for Xylella fastidiosa, a very high-risk and damaging bacterial disease.

“The end customer would have expected and paid for the at-border check … Yet the business received no information about what had happened and why, nor was it aware that those trees had an incomplete check.”

The government said it was working closely with traders to ensure checks are completed efficiently and swiftly, while also publishing guidance on how to reduce delays for companies.

It added that checks were handled by fully trained staff to standard operating procedures ensuring inspections were undertaken safely.

The other signatories to the letter were the European Nurserystock Association, Royal Anthos (the Dutch Association for Nursery Stock and Flower Bulbs), VBN (the Dutch Flower Auctions Association) and Transport en Logistiek Nederland (the Dutch Transport & Logistics Association).","Nurseries and garden centres across Britain and Europe have warned that new post-Brexit border posts are not working properly and are leading to delays, damage and significant extra costs for importers bringing plants into Britain.
The new rules mean certain plant and animal products coming into Britain from the EU must now be checked at border posts situated in or nearby British ports.
Another company reported three of its trailers filled with plants were held at a border post for 44 hours after a software problem.
Under the new rules these checks take place almost exclusively at both government-run and privately run border posts.

The Guardian,https://www.theguardian.com/politics/article/2024/jun/29/transport-labour-tories-potholes-hs2-rail-road-pricing,2024-06-29,08:00:46 UTC,"From potholes to HS2, transport gets voters going – but some solutions are unsayable","Better railways, safer roads, cleaner fuels: in another decade, they would be the kind of transport issues commanding a pragmatic consensus in British politics.

But this election lands with transport wildly politicised, with clean air, speed limits and high-speed rail all dragged into the wider culture wars.

Meanwhile, transport has become emblematic of decline and the fraying public realm, from failing rail services to the potholes that pockmark Britain’s tarmac.

So what might the election resolve – and what are the transport policies deemed too difficult to sell?

The culture war battleground: drivers, Ulez and HS2

One of Keir Starmer’s less convincing recent repositionings may have been declaring Labour “the only party on the side of drivers” – a response to the long Conservative campaign to hammer home its backing for “people’s freedom to use their cars”.

The Tory plan for motorists was first outlined by the transport secretary, Mark Harper, in 2023 in a conference speech that appeared to echo online conspiracy theories about 15-minute cities, and signalled a clear move away from some of the urban planning measures the government had backed during Covid.

Now the party’s manifesto highlights its “backing drivers bill” in a chapter dedicated to “strengthening our communities”, pledging to curb low-traffic neighbourhoods (LTNs) and 20mph zones and reverse the expansion of London’s ultra-low emission zone (Ulez) – an unpopular move pinned firmly on Labour via the mayor, Sadiq Khan, despite the government’s own part in setting it up.

The rhetoric of ending a “war on motorists” is shared in Reform UK’s manifesto, which would scrap 20mph speed limits, LTNs and the Ulez, along with net zero commitments to transition from fossil fuel to electric vehicles.

Campaigners are concerned by the inflammatory language. Silviya Barrett, policy and research director of the Campaign for Better Transport (CBT), says: “We’re all more than just a driver, just a cyclist – we all need a range of means by which to move. Many drivers use buses and trains too, many walk their kids to school, and most drivers are keen to have more options.”

Another headline Conservative promise is to “stop road pricing”, implicitly accusing Labour of planning a pay-per-mile scheme. Starmer’s party has not backed any such policy, even though transport experts – including motoring organisations – believe some such scheme eventually must come.

Beyond roads, HS2 has perhaps been the only other transport issue as divisive. Scrapping the entire route, including that already half-built from London to Birmingham, is Reform’s headline transport policy, whose back-of-an-envelope calculations claim to save another £25bn.

Any mention of HS2 is conspicuously absent from Labour’s manifesto, while the Conservatives’ reiterates the derided “Network North” mixture of schemes funded by a putative £36bn saving from axing HS2’s northern leg. Only a lonely Liberal Democrat paragraph proposes finding a way to rekindle the high-speed railway to Manchester and beyond.

The post-election action areas: rail reform – and potholes

Despite the fate of the UK’s biggest engineering project, both big parties are pledging to speed up infrastructure delivery, with a Labour review under the ex-Siemens boss Jürgen Maier claiming both time and money could be saved.

But the humble pothole is perhaps focusing more minds: as Labour’s manifesto puts it, “the potholes cratering our roads are a visible sign of the decline after 14 years of Conservative rule”. The Tories have already earmarked £8bn to fill roads instead of building HS2. And even in a Labour manifesto where additional spending is all but forbidden, an extra £65m a year for potholes will be found by putting off a road-building scheme, the planned A27 bypass in West Sussex.

A bigger Labour pledge, but one that it argues is cost-free, is immediate rail reform, with the shadow transport secretary, Louise Haigh, promising “the biggest overhaul to our railways in a generation”.

Labour can afford to go large on reform plans that in many ways align with the Conservatives’ own belated attempts to force through change. Even what might once have been regarded as an ideological red line between the parties – partial renationalisation of rail – has been reluctantly enacted under the current government, as franchising collapsed and more train operators were taken into public hands.

Whoever wins, a new Great British Railways with a shake-up of the railway’s structure and fares is promised. The “guiding mind” will have plenty to work at: latest annual figures from the rail regulator, the Office of Rail and Road, show that only 85% of trains were officially on time (ie within five or 10 minutes of schedule) in 2023-24 – the worst performance in 19 years.

A critical task will be to end the disruption from rail’s long-running industrial relations standoff. While the Conservatives recommit to the ill-fated minimum service levels legislation, Labour makes no direct mention of the strikes, but a manifesto laced with references to working in partnership with unions to “end chaos” suggests a possible reset.

Off limits: road pricing and curbing flying

The vast majority of taxation from motoring comes from fuel duty paid via the petrol pump: about £27bn in annual Treasury revenue destined to dwindle and vanish as cars turn electric. For many transport experts, some form of road pricing appears inevitable and the fairest system. Politics, however, is likely to rule it out.

“Road pricing is toxic because it is very complicated,” says Steve Gooding, director of the RAC Foundation, who was once tasked as a civil servant with drawing up a plan that produced enormous public backlash. “People think – ‘I’m not driving in the rush hour because I like it, but because my employer wants me to turn up’.”

View image in fullscreen The Campaign for Better Transport advocates a charge of 2p a km for electric cars. Photograph: Ceri Breeze/Alamy

Barrett and the CBT have proposed a 2p per km charge for electric cars to make sure all drivers contribute to the exchequer. Gooding counsels that any scheme should be as simple as possible, citing the kind of pay-per-mile schemes being introduced in Iceland and New Zealand. He adds: “The dilemma is the government wants you to buy an electric car – but how do you do that if you charge people to drive it?”

But, he says: “I would be flabbergasted if someone in the Treasury building isn’t already doing that calculation. We all think this charge is coming. The sooner you are honest about it, the sooner people can factor it into their decisions.”

However, parties appear to be shying away from even the lip service paid to future net zero commitments. A Greenpeace/Friends of the Earth manifesto analysis scores the Conservatives on 1.5 out of 10 on transport, compared with 4.5 for Labour and 8.5 and 9 for the Lib Dems and Greens respectively.

Tackling aviation emissions is a harder, and could be even less electorally popular to fix than the transition for cars. The Lib Dems and Greens espouse some kind of frequent flyer levy, a ban on short domestic flights where a rail alternative exists, and increased taxation, on private jets in particular. Both main parties affirm support for the sector and its dubious solution of sustainable aviation fuels.","But this election lands with transport wildly politicised, with clean air, speed limits and high-speed rail all dragged into the wider culture wars.

The Guardian,https://www.theguardian.com/business/article/2024/jun/30/owner-of-port-talbot-steelworks-offers-talks-to-keep-last-blast-furnace-open,2024-06-30,17:34:46 UTC,Owner of Port Talbot steelworks offers fresh talks as last furnace faces closure,"The owner of the Port Talbot steelworks has written to trade unions offering fresh talks amid a battle to delay plans that would see 2,800 jobs lost and production suspended at a site that has been in operation since 1951.

The Guardian understands that a letter sent on Sunday afternoon by Rajesh Nair, the UK boss of Tata Steel, has offered a new round of discussions about future investments at the company’s plants in the UK, including Port Talbot.

However, sources have said the offer to the National Trade Union Steel Coordinating Committee, which represents all three unions at the site in south Wales, is predicated on unions agreeing to suspend any future industrial action.

Tata had originally planned to close the second of its two remaining blast furnaces at the end of September, while the process of shutting down the first is due to begin in the middle of this week. Other elements that will close include the harbour, sinter plant, ore yards and primary steelmaking, bringing to a halt more than 70 years of steelmaking in Port Talbot.

The plans were brought forward after the Unite union announced indefinite strike action beginning on 8 July. Tata said it could not “safely and stably” operate the plant during any strike, and it has brought forward complete closure of the second furnace to as early as next Sunday, 7 July.

The new electric furnace is not due to come onstream until 2027 and unions want steelmaking to continue until then. Unite warned over the weekend that any closure would be “irreversible” and urged Tata not to “abandon” the workers employed at the plant.

It said: “We again call on the company to wait until we have a change of government, not make any irreversible decisions, and enter into meaningful negotiations.”

The shadow business secretary, Jonathan Reynolds, was reportedly in talks with the unions and Tata last week in an effort to avert the early closure.

The first minister of Wales, Vaughan Gething, and the Welsh economy secretary, Jeremy Miles, said: “The news that Tata could switch off blast furnaces 4 and 5 at Port Talbot next week is extraordinary and will cause huge anxiety for the workforce, their families and the community.

“The Welsh government cannot and will not support the closure of both blast furnaces.”

Earlier this year, Tata struck a controversial deal with the UK government, securing a £500m grant to build a greener £1.25bn electric arc furnace. However, the company wants to mothball Port Talbot during construction, leaving thousands of local people without work in a town where Tata is the main employer.

The Labour party, widely expected to win a majority in Thursday’s general election, has previously promised to invest £3bn in the UK’s steel industry in the next parliament, if elected. This would include the £500m already pledged to Port Talbot.

Last month Unite announced that its 1,500 Tata members would commence “all-out indefinite strike action” from 8 July, vowing to continue the strikes until Tata stopped its “disastrous” plan.

The Community and GMB unions, which also represent staff at Port Talbot, have said they will wait until after the election before deciding whether to strike.

Unite insisted on Saturday it would keep enough staff on site during the strike to ensure all safety procedures would be met, which would ensure the furnaces could function until September.

Tata has also now launched a legal challenge against Unite to try to avert its planned strike action, with a decision on whether it has been successful expected on Wednesday.

If successful, Tata could revert to its plan of closing the second furnace in September.

Unite has hit back at the legal action, saying: “Instead of waiting for a likely change of government, Tata has decided to double down, making continued threats and hiring City lawyers to try to stop industrial action on trumped-up technicalities. If they are successful, Unite will reballot. We cannot allow these steel jobs to go.”

Tata has previously said it is losing about £1m each day keeping the remaining furnaces open.

A Tata spokesperson said: “In the coming days, if we cannot be certain that we are able to continue to safely and stably operate our assets through the period of strike action, we will not have any choice but to pause or stop heavy end operations (including both blast furnaces) on the Port Talbot site.

“That is not a decision we would take lightly, and we recognise that it would prove extremely costly and disruptive throughout the supply chain, but the safety of people on or around our sites will always take priority over everything else.”","The owner of the Port Talbot steelworks has written to trade unions offering fresh talks amid a battle to delay plans that would see 2,800 jobs lost and production suspended at a site that has been in operation since 1951.

The Guardian,https://www.theguardian.com/environment/article/2024/jun/30/uk-haulage-industry-calls-for-investment-in-electric-truck-infrastructure,2024-06-30,12:41:16 UTC,UK haulage industry calls for investment in electric truck infrastructure,"The road haulage industry is calling on the new government to urgently tackle investment in infrastructure for electric trucks, after pointing out there is just one public charging point for HGVs in the whole of the UK.

Takeup of electric cars is soaring, with about 1.1m fully battery-powered cars on British roads and about 63,000 charging units in 33,000 locations, according to Zapmap data.

But the haulage industry is miles behind, with just 300 electric HGVs registered out of the country’s 500,000-strong lorry fleet, says the Road Haulage Association (RHA).

After surveying the country, the RHA found only one public charging point at which lorries can power up. It is located at a service station at Rivington, on the M61 southbound about halfway between Manchester and Preston.

Chris Ashley, policy lead on environment and vehicles at the RHA, said action was needed. He said: “All the anxieties people have with cars, whether it’s raining, whether the windscreen wipers or air conditioning are running, applies to trucks. It depends on the weather and the load.

“On average, a good range for a diesel truck would be 600 miles, with caveats of course. That is why a public charging network is necessary, in our view,” he said.

Research shows 70% of British electric trucks return to depots for recharging overnight, according to the RHA. Longer-haul journeys are impossible on batteries, which means most electric trucks are used for local deliveries within a 50- to 80-mile radius.

The size and weight of trucks means the distance they can achieve on a battery is a fraction of a car, just 200 miles.

The RHA is planning to submit 12 demands to the new government, with polls predicting a Labour win in this week’s election.

It wants the incoming government to build a trial network of HGV charging points, speed up planning applications “gummed up in the wider planning process” for HGV electricy substations at truck depots, and offer financial incentives for small and medium-sized businesses to make the switch to electric.

Trucks cannot be charged outside truckers’ homes and companies with large fleets may need substations installed to cope with the energy consumption, as trucks need at least 150KW of power, compared with a 22KW minimum for cars.

Chris Pritchett, partner and energy and mobility lawyer at the law firm Shoosmiths, said it was “crucially important” the government developed the right strategy to install the charging units at the right places.

Energy and haulage companies may even have to work together to schedule times at the units at motorway stations.

“It will require a sort of utopian level of collaboration,” said Pritchett. “The way forward is more nuanced and complex than for passenger vehicles.”

Work is already under way to tackle the shortage. Energy company Gridserve is leading a government-backed trial to roll out 200 chargers capable of delivering 350kW.

“What we need is momentum and [we’ll] see decarbonisation start to snowball,” said Ashley.

The current government plan is to phase out the sale of diesel and petrol HGVs of 26 tonnes or below by 2035 and the sale of all new HGVs heavier than that by 2040.

The Department for Transport had no comment ahead of the election.","The road haulage industry is calling on the new government to urgently tackle investment in infrastructure for electric trucks, after pointing out there is just one public charging point for HGVs in the whole of the UK.
But the haulage industry is miles behind, with just 300 electric HGVs registered out of the country’s 500,000-strong lorry fleet, says the Road Haulage Association (RHA).
After surveying the country, the RHA found only one public charging point at which lorries can power up.
Research shows 70% of British electric trucks return to depots for recharging overnight, according to the RHA.
Longer-haul journeys are impossible on batteries, which means most electric trucks are used for local deliveries within a 50- to 80-mile radius.","['industry', 'investment', 'electric', 'need', 'infrastructure', 'rha', 'hgvs', 'truck', 'units', 'privacy', 'haulage', 'public', 'trucks', 'uk', 'charging', 'calls']",https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e2971b93c1ea92b953a890ff2048659d21eed927/0_225_4032_2419/master/4032.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=79546d1b6e935b4132c3421f3d1347f2,,fml lah,road haulag industri call new govern urgent tackl invest infrastructur electr truck point one public charg point hgvs whole uk takeup electr car soar m fulli batterypow car british road charg unit locat accord zapmap data haulag industri mile behind electr hgvs regist countri 's strong lorri fleet say road haulag associ rha survey countri rha found one public charg point lorri power up locat servic station rivington m southbound halfway manchest preston chris ashley polici lead environ vehicl rha said action need said `` all anxieti peopl car whether it 's rain whether windscreen wiper air condit run appli truck depend weather load `` on averag good rang diesel truck would mile caveat cours public charg network necessari view '' said research show british electr truck return depot recharg overnight accord rha longerhaul journey imposs batteri mean electr truck use local deliveri within mile radius size weight truck mean distanc achiev batteri fraction car mile rha plan submit demand new govern poll predict labour win week 's elect skip past newslett promot sign busi today free daili newslett get set work day - well point busi news analysi need everi morn enter email address sign privaci notic newslett may contain info chariti onlin ad content fund outsid parti inform see newslett may contain info chariti onlin ad content fund outsid parti inform see privaci polici use googl recaptcha protect websit googl privaci polici term servic appli newslett promot want incom govern build trial network hgv charg point speed plan applic `` gum wider plan process '' hgv electrici substat truck depot offer financi incent small mediums busi make switch electr truck can not charg outsid trucker ' home compani larg fleet may need substat instal cope energi consumpt truck need least kw power compar kw minimum car chris pritchett partner energi mobil lawyer law firm shoosmith said `` crucial import '' govern develop right strategi instal charg unit right place energi haulag compani may even work togeth schedul time unit motorway station `` it requir sort utopian level collabor '' said pritchett `` the way forward nuanc complex passeng vehicl '' work alreadi way tackl shortag energi compani gridserv lead governmentback trial roll charger capabl deliv kw `` what need momentum we ll see decarbonis start snowbal '' said ashley current govern plan phase sale diesel petrol hgvs tonn sale new hgvs heavier depart transport comment ahead elect
The Guardian,https://www.theguardian.com/business/article/2024/jun/30/the-baby-bust-how-britains-falling-birthrate-is-creating-alarm-in-the-economy,2024-06-30,10:00:21 UTC,The baby bust: how Britain’s falling birthrate is creating alarm in the economy,"Having children has become an unaffordable luxury for many of her generation, says Vanessa, a 35-year-old project manager living in Brighton.

“My friends who managed to start a family, without exception, all received large sums of money from their parents to get on the property ladder. For those of us not fortunate enough, we are trapped in the rental market, largely with insecure, poorly paid employment.”

Vanessa’s outlook is also clouded by concerns about the climate crisis, crumbling public services and the “plummeting mental health of young people”, she says. “Put these into the mix and you have a perfect storm for declining birthrates.”

Her decision is replicated worldwide. The number of women of child-bearing age is in long-term decline across Europe, parts of Asia, South America and the US, a situation made worse by the steep drop in the number of women, and their partners, who either want or are able to have children.

These factors have led to a sharp fall in fertility rates – the number of children born to each woman.

While the issues facing governments from rapidly ageing populations are relatively familiar, a decline in fertility rates that was once limited to Japan has spread across the world. Today, almost every continent has a growing age-dependency ratio as average birthrates fall and people live longer. If the global population hits 10.4 billion in the 2080s as predicted, it will only be because sub-Saharan Africa has continued on its current trend, pushing the population across the African continent from about 1.5 billion to as many as 2.5 billion.

Here we look at the trends, and the implications for future governments, of a demographic revolution.

How the UK is affected

The total fertility rate across England and Wales fell to 1.49 children per woman in 2022, from 1.55 in 2021, according to the Office for National Statistics (ONS).

As a benchmark, the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) says that to maintain a population, the “replacement rate”, often known as the “R-rate”, needs to be at least 2.1 children per woman.

It has been well documented that the pandemic, rather than spark a baby boom, had the reverse effect. Yet the recent drop in fertility has shocked demographers. The rate was already declining, starting in 2010: then came Covid-19, the Russian invasion of Ukraine and a deepening of the climate crisis, which all appeared to add a further downward shift, taking the fertility rate to the lowest since comparative data began being kept in the 1930s.

Ann Berrington, a professor of demography and social statistics at Southampton University, says: “The Human Fertility Database covering England and Wales documents the 1960s baby boom, 1970s baby bust, the fluctuations of the 1980s and 1990s that kept things fairly stable, increases through 2000s to 2010, and then a decline to the historical low levels seen today.”

The trend in Scotland follows the same pattern, but on a lower trajectory during each period over the last 60 years. Northern Ireland follows the same pattern on a slightly elevated path. ONS figures tracking live births tell the same story of decline. They show 605,479 in England and Wales in 2022, a 3.1% fall from 2021 and the lowest number since 2002.

This figure is not an all-time low because the UK’s population has been expanding since 2003, when the UK embraced the free movement of people from countries that had recently joined the EU. Opening its doors to workers from eastern Europe resulted in an increase in total births, and maintained fertility rates, which were about the same for UK-born and foreign-born women at the time.

But when record numbers of women are reaching the age of 30 child-free, the effect has clearly waned.

According to the latest data, half of women born in 1990 were childless by their 30th birthday – the first generation for which that is true.

It’s the economy …

When the Observer asked readers, including Vanessa, to say why they had not had children, or had restricted the size of their family, most replied that financial constraints were the main reason.

Hannah, a 35-year-old marketing executive living in London, says she had been unable to have the two children she wanted with her partner of 10 years, despite moving to a cheaper area to secure a bigger home.

Childcare costs were prohibitively high, along with other costs of living, she says. “The family we want to have is financially out of reach. We have only ever had one holiday together since our relationship began. We are cutting down on food bills and looking for extra work to make having a child happen.” She and her partner are considering moving abroad.

In the early 00s, Britain and France were outliers in Europe. Both countries had generous family benefits and governments with a stated aim of supporting children. The scale of generosity, from tax credits for low earners to an expansion of early years centres and childcare subsidies, meant both countries – under Labour in the UK and the Gaullist centre-right in France – arrested declines over previous decades.

In the UK and France, these subsidies were scaled back after the recessions of 2008-09. Austerity across all public services was the message from Nicolas Sarkozy, France’s president from 2007 to 2012, and from the UK ’s coalition government from 2010 to 2015.

For all the impact of welfare and public service cuts, a study by Fathom Consulting indicates those interested in creating a family look further ahead. In the aftermath of the financial crash of 2008, it was clear the future for many households looked bleak, with incomes flat and costs, especially housing, on a steady incline. Without the optimism of previous generations, couples decided not to have children, according to the initial findings from a study of Japan that links declines in fertility with periods when the future outlook for the economy was uncertain.

“It turns out that there is a good relationship between forecasts of 15-year forward growth in Japan at any point in time and the fertility rate in Japan at the same point in time,” says the report.

“In other words, people have kids when they feel optimistic that, when their kids join the workforce, the standard of living they will enjoy will be better than it is now.”

To measure growth, the report used national income per capita, which has improved in Japan while the overall economy has stagnated. Japan’s fertility rate is 1.3, just ahead of Italy’s 1.2 and South Korea’s 0.8.

The consultancy’s director, Erik Britton, says the research is ongoing and the conclusions only tentative, but the initial findings reveal that government support, while a necessary element, might not be the most important factor. A nation confidently growing its economy is the comfort people need before starting a family, he says.

… but also other factors

Recent data from the UK Generations and Gender Survey tells us that the ideal family size remains relatively high, with an average of about two children. There remains evidence of a two-child family ideal.

Berrington says that when her team asked childless people whether they intend to have children, there was “a lot of uncertainty in the answers”. Higher proportions of young adults said they probably or definitely would not have children, as compared with the proportions reported by millennials at a similar age.

Fiona Powley, 49, a life coach, knew she did not want children by the age of 12, and knows many contemporaries who also prefer to be child-free; she runs the group Bristol Childfree Women. As an indication of the problem faced by any government seeking to boost fertility, she says that when she asks people as they join her community what they enjoy most about being child-free, “they talk about time and freedom: finances don’t usually feature”.

She adds: “A common judgment from others asks ‘who will look after you when you’re old?’, to which most members might say they’ve made good financial provision for older-age care and pensions as they’ve not have the financial strain of children.”

Sarah Harper, a professor of gerontology at Oxford University, says one of the main issues is equality, meaning equal treatment by the state and within a relationship.

It is only when women believe they can continue working and have spare time that they will take the plunge into motherhood, she says – though the evidence from the Nordic countries, where fertility rates have followed the general downward trend, is weak. However, it might explain why traditional South Korea’s fertility rate is so low.

“These days women say they have no obligation to reproduce and ‘I’m not going to have a baby who turns my life upside down’,” says Harper, who advised the David Cameron’s government on the implications of an ageing society.

Public services

The Treasury’s independent forecaster, the Office for Budget Responsibility (OBR), says falling birthrates are going to have a negative effect on tax receipts. That is a situation that is not necessarily solved by higher immigration.

In a recent report, it said that while every additional migrant generally boosts the level of output in the economy, “the size of this impact and the effect on per-person living standards is highly uncertain.

“The age, education, skill level, and participation rate of migrants, alongside the investment response of businesses, are all factors that determine the impact of migration on per-person output,” it said.

At the moment, the UK population is increasing – by an estimated 6.6 million to 73.7 million over the next 15 years – but the economy is on course to grow at a slower pace, meaning there is less of the financial pie to go around.

Without a healthy rise in tax receipts, governments will struggle to pay for vital services.

Schools are in the frontline of cuts as pupil numbers decline, according to the Resolution Foundation. In England, they could lose up to £1bn in funding by 2030, with exceptional falls in pupil numbers prompting closures as some establishments cease to be financially viable. Councils across the country have begun to consult local residents about mergers and closures to make the system viable.

According to the Education Policy Institute (EPI), a thinktank, the north-east is projected to see the greatest decline in primary pupil numbers, down 13% by 2028-29.

Primary school teachers could face redundancy, such is the dramatic loss of young children, says Lindsey Macmillan, an education policy expert at University College London. She says secondary schools that are now suffering teacher shortages will see the gap close as classes are cut and schools merged.

Pupil numbers had grown because of a fertility surge in the 00s, but that cohort has moved through primary and on to secondaries, leaving empty seats in their wake.

Looking ahead, even with real terms increases in per-pupil funding over the remainder of the decade, the EPI predicts that many schools will suffer funding cuts due to fewer pupils causing income to fall, though costs will remain high.

What about ageing?

Plenty of questions arise over the fact that the birthrate is falling while medical improvements are helping older people live longer. Will robots be able to look after elderly people? Could a new social contract between young and old give millennials and gen Z the security and encouragement they need to have more children? And can the UK import all the missing labour it needs, such as from sub-Saharan Africa, where births are expected to be higher?

Nik Lomax, a professor of population geography at Leeds University, says one problem faced by the next government will be how different regions are affected.

“One way of thinking about the implications of this is to assess the old-age dependency ratio – the number of people of retirement age for every 1,000 people of working age,” he says. “This reveals striking differences by geography, and will get larger over time as the number of old people relative to working age people increases.”

Just as fertility rates are falling fastest in the north-east, Wales, the south-west and parts of the Midlands, the dependency ratio is increasing in these regions too.

Harper says a clear trend shows fewer people entering the workforce and older people living longer, and not necessarily in good health.

“Men in areas that rank in the lowest third by average incomes will live until they are 80, but spend their 70s in ill health,” she says. “Men who live in the top third of affluent areas will live until their late 80s and won’t be ill or have a disability, on average, until they are 80.”

Harper says the Cameron government put ageing into its industrial strategy and considered many of the implications of falling birthrates and rising levels of ill health among a growing number of over-65s. But the industrial strategy and policy initiatives were later jettisoned.

Given that we are not going to change the dynamics of fertility rates and have women go back to producing three to four children, we need to extend people’s lives in a healthy way, Harper says.

Berrington says the implications for policymaking are “very significant – for example, the short-term decline in demand for childcare, maternity services and other parts of the economy that depend on people buying goods and services for children. “Policy responses to low fertility have tended to focus on ways to increase fertility,” she says. “However, many pronatalist policies do not work, especially cash benefits, as they tend to just bring forward in time births that would happen anyway, and not increase the overall number of births.”

Pronatalist policies – those that attempt to boost the birthrate – are also often problematic in terms of entrenching gender inequality and reducing reproductive freedom.

A report by the Social Market Foundation thinktank in 2021 said the tens of billions of pounds it would take to support an expansion of family welfare could be better spent. “We do not recommend that the government pursues a distinct ‘population strategy’ to increase the birthrate. However, the government should convene a cross-departmental working group to examine how different policies affect the birthrate,” it said.

Berrington says healthy ageing is crucial to the prospects for the economy, providing more workers and helping fill the state’s coffers.

“And governments will need to look to other policy solutions, such as increasing employment among groups which for different reasons – poor mental wellbeing, or because they have young children – have relatively high inactivity rates.”","These factors have led to a sharp fall in fertility rates – the number of children born to each woman.

The Guardian,https://www.theguardian.com/business/article/2024/jun/30/unusual-economic-indicators,2024-06-30,11:00:20 UTC,What can lipstick and underwear sales tell us about the economy?,"Is the country heading towards a recession? Ask 10 economists and you’ll likely get 10 different answers. Which is why some people have given up on the traditional data – GDP, jobs, etc – and have instead recently been tinkering with more unusual economic indicators to help them guide their companies. Here are a few that I’ve seen.

Uniform patches

One known economic indicator is jobs and for that we tend to rely on unemployment numbers from the Bureau of Labor Statistics. But maybe there’s something better. Like the number of uniform patches sold each year. Uniform patches? Yes, those are the emblems that go on the uniforms worn by millions of workers, from fast food cashiers to drywall contractors. The financial data of one of the world’s largest makers of emblems and patches – privately held World Emblem – can’t be easily obtained. But the company’s owner recently told USA Today that sales are up 19% from the same period last year. A recession? “We’re not seeing it,” says Randy Carr, CEO of the Fort Lauderdale, Florida-based company. “It’s hard to believe there would be.”

Men’s underwear

Ask any guy about underwear, and they’ll usually admit the same thing. When times are good, we’re buying the good material. When money’s tight, we’re wearing those things until they literally fall off. So do men’s underwear sales mirror the economy overall? Some – including former Federal Reserve chief Alan Greenspan – think so. If you want to check out how the men’s underwear business is doing you can look at Hanesbrands or PVH Corp (which owns several leading brands, including Calvin Klein and Tommy Hilfiger) or Ralph Lauren Corporation. “Bottom” line: men’s underwear sales have been mostly flat over the past 12 months.

Lipstick

For the most part, lipstick is a relatively inexpensive accessory, with a typical tube costing anywhere from $5 to $20. History has shown that women will cut back on more expensive beauty goods like makeup and perfume when times are tight. But lipstick? Don’t even go there. When lipstick sales increase as luxury beauty item accessories decrease, that’s another potential sign of economic headwinds. Where to research lipstick sales? Try the big cosmetics companies like L’Oreal, Estee Lauder and Ulta Beauty. All three companies have shown strong revenue gains over the past year.

Overseas freight

World shipping has a significant impact on our economy and instead of tracking units and cargo activity, some economists instead track the price of freight. Why? Because in a supply and demand world, the greater the demand for shipping, the more freight should cost. To track this phenomena, look no further than the Baltic Dry Index. This is a well-watched measure of freight costs for shipping items across the Baltic Sea, one of the world’s busiest shipping lanes. So how are freight costs doing? They’re up more than 55% over the past year and even slightly higher than pre-Covid times.

Recreational vehicles

If you’ve never taken a trip in a recreational vehicle (RV), you’re missing out. It’s fun and a great way to explore our national parks. Some economists think that RV sales are an economic indicator because RVs – a luxury item - are not only expensive to buy, but they come with high maintenance costs and tend to calculate gas usage by gallons per mile. So how’s the RV industry doing? Judging by one of America’s largest makers of these vehicles – Winnebago – not so great. Sales have been declining for the past few years and the company’s stock price has fallen 35% in the past year.

I’m only scratching the surface on unusual economic indicators. Besides RVs you can follow the sales of champagne. Instead of men’s underwear you can also track women’s hemlines (which are believed to rise and fall along with the stock market). You can dig into the buttered popcorn index (which some say increases during times of recession as a small bit of a luxury in an otherwise cruel world). You can even keep track of hairstyles in Japan, where some say that women wear their hair longer when times are good and shorter when times are tough. Good luck finding this data, let alone making any sense of it.

Goofy economic metrics like these are fun to talk about with your friends and colleagues. But they shouldn’t be taken seriously. I run a business, and my go-to economic indicator is my clients. I’ve learned that the best way to insulate my business from the economy is to diversify: have as many clients in as many industries and geographic locations as possible. The US is a big country, and even when one client is cutting back on his underwear purchases in Illinois, I’ll likely have another buying uniform emblems in Texas.

The Guardian,https://www.theguardian.com/business/article/2024/jun/29/rishi-sunak-smoking-ban-bill-backlash-tobacco-firms,2024-06-29,05:00:44 UTC,Revealed: how Sunak dropped smoking ban amid lobbying from tobacco firms,"Rishi Sunak abandoned his “legacy” policy to ban smoking for future generations amid a backlash from the tobacco industry in the form of legal threats, lobbying and a charm offensive aimed at Conservative MPs, an investigation reveals.

The UK had been on course to become the first country to ban smoking for future generations, via the tobacco and vaping bill, which Downing Street hoped would help define Sunak’s place in British political history.

An investigation by the Guardian and the Examination, a non-profit newsroom that investigates global health threats, has uncovered how the UK’s largest cigarette companies fought against the policy, which would have raised the smoking age by one year every year.

After months of fierce opposition from the industry – and intervention from MPs and thinktanks with ties to tobacco firms – the proposal was excluded from the “wash-up” process, when outgoing governments choose which policies to fast-track and which to drop.

The policy, which in effect banned smoking for anyone born after 2009, was left out despite MPs having voted in favour of it.

Documents and freedom of information requests reveal how four of the world’s largest tobacco firms – the UK’s Imperial Brands and British American Tobacco (BAT), Japan Tobacco International (JTI) and US-headquartered Philip Morris International (PMI) – put ministers on notice of a legal backlash.

Imperial and BAT wrote to the health secretary, Victoria Atkins, in February, to claim the consultation process preceding legislation was “unlawful” because industry views had not been considered.

The Department of Health and Social Care has said it did not need to consider industry views, pointing to guidance included in a World Health Organization global treaty, signed by the UK, that says governments should form smoking policy without influence from cigarette companies.

The Marlboro-owner PMI and JTI, which makes Camel and Benson & Hedges, said the treaty permitted interactions with cigarette firms if they were “necessary”.

Imperial, which owns Lambert & Butler and Gauloises, followed up its warning with a legal letter threatening a “judicial review” challenging the consultation process.

Government lawyers responded by saying legal action might “derail” a bill that ministers believed could save tens of thousands of lives and billions of pounds in NHS costs.

BAT, JTI and PMI were named as interested parties in Imperial’s letter, giving them the right to join as co-claimants if a judicial review went ahead.

Imperial, which sells half of all of the cigarettes smoked in the UK, has not filed court proceedings but a spokesperson said the company was “keeping the situation under review as we monitor legislative developments”.

The legal threats came after the industry opposed the legislation in its submissions to the consultation, despite claiming publicly that they wanted to phase out cigarettes.

PMI’s chief executive, Jacek Olczak, indicated in 2021 interviews that it could stop selling cigarettes in the UK within 10 years.

However, the company’s UK subsidiary told the consultation it “did not support the age of sale ban as outlined”, arguing instead for “further restrictions” on “combustible tobacco” – ie cigarettes – instead of an outright ban.

PMI told the Guardian the bill risked “confusing” consumers because it included restrictions on some smoke-free products such as vapes, adding that it “firmly believes in phasing out cigarettes, to the benefit of the 6.4 million adult smokers in the UK”.

BAT, which has previously advocated for a “smokeless” future, proposed raising the age of sale to 21 instead.

As the government pressed ahead with its plans despite opposition, tobacco firms courted rightwing and libertarian Tory MPs. In January, three months after Sunak announced his policy on smoking, the then Clacton MP, Giles Watling, attended a “business lunch” with officials from JTI. Two months later, he went to the company’s annual party at the British Museum in London.

In May, he proposed an amendment that would have replaced Sunak’s proposals with a new minimum age of 21.

“We are strongly of the opinion that engagement results in better and more informed policy and is therefore in the best interests of all relevant parties,” JTI said. Watling did not return requests for comment.

Other MPs targeted by the tobacco industry included the business secretary, Kemi Badenoch. The Imported Tobacco Products Advisory Council wrote to her in March complaining about the “open dismissal of industry views in the decision making process”.

Its secretary general, Tatiana Camacho, accused the health department of “taking a position that seems to go against the spirit of collaboration and inclusiveness”.

A month later Badenoch voted against the smoking ban at its second reading in the Commons, posting on X at the time: “The principle of equality under the law is a fundamental one … We should not treat legally competent adults differently in this way, where people born a day apart will have permanently different rights.”

Two Conservative MPs, including Badenoch’s closest political aide, also attended a lunch and drinks reception hosted by the smoking lobby group Forest, days before the tobacco bill was in effect shelved.

The Beat the Ban event, at Boisdale restaurant in Belgravia, London, featured beermats depicting Sunak as a nanny, an allusion to the ban being a “nanny state” measure.

Badenoch’s parliamentary private secretary, Alexander Stafford, attended alongside fellow Conservative MP Andrew Rosindell. Tobacco lobbyists present included Camacho and Richard Cleary, who left Badenoch’s department to join Imperial in January.

Stafford has said he does not smoke but opposed the ban as a “lover of freedom, a lover of choice and a lover of information”.

He and Rosindell did not return a request for comment.

The Forest director Simon Clark said the organisation did not seek to persuade MPs who attended to oppose the bill becoming law but did outline the group’s position in a speech.

The government also came under pressure from rightwing thinktanks funded by the tobacco industry during the consultation process.

In total, there were 307 responses in which the respondent disclosed ties to the tobacco industry, including from the Institute of Economic Affairs (IEA) and Adam Smith Institute. Both have received funding from JTI, while the IEA has also received money from Imperial and BAT.

BAT, the owner of Lucky Strike and Rothmans, said: “We are clear that combustible cigarettes pose serious health risks, and the only way to avoid these risks is not to start smoking or to quit.

“However, we do not believe that a generational sales ban will have the desired impact given the serious unintended consequences that are likely to follow, such as age verification being difficult to manage, and an increase in illicit trading.”

The Conservative party did not return requests for comment.","Rishi Sunak abandoned his “legacy” policy to ban smoking for future generations amid a backlash from the tobacco industry in the form of legal threats, lobbying and a charm offensive aimed at Conservative MPs, an investigation reveals.

The Guardian,https://www.theguardian.com/business/article/2024/jun/29/will-rising-debt-cause-thames-water-to-sink-under-a-labour-government,2024-06-29,08:00:46 UTC,Will rising debt cause Thames Water to sink under a Labour government?,"If Labour triumphs in this week’s election, as polls suggest, then top of the incoming business secretary Jonathan Reynolds’s in-tray will be the possible collapse of Thames Water. The Thames timebomb is ticking – and could explode before new MPs have even become fully acquainted with the corridors of Westminster.

To recap, Britain’s biggest water company has been labouring under an £18bn debt mountain and has become the chief target of mounting anger from the public and politicians towards the industry over sewage spills, executive pay and shareholder payouts.

In March, Thames investors refused to stump up a pledged £500m of emergency funding amid a standoff with the industry regulator, Ofwat. So acute are concerns that the government has tasked officials with making contingency plans for a temporary renationalisation, codenamed Project Timber.

Its finances were back in the spotlight this week, when the Guardian revealed that a £150m dividend paid out from the regulated company on 27 March – hours before investors pulled the plug – was being examined by Ofwat. An internal party dossier by Labour’s chief of staff, Sue Gray, seen by the Financial Times, put the company’s potential collapse high on the party’s “risk register” after taking power, alongside prison overcrowding, bankrupt councils and an NHS funding shortfall.

One of the first tests will be the postponed publication of Ofwat’s proposals for the water industry on 11 July. The regulator had been due to release its draft “price review 24” – the process by which it determines how much each company can charge customers over the following five years – on 12 June, but the pivotal moment was delayed by Rishi Sunak’s soggy early election announcement.

Thames’s own five-year plan, submitted in October and updated in April, is at the heart of its standoff with shareholders, who fear Ofwat’s response to it will be too stringent. The company has promised an extra £1.1bn to tackle environmental issues on top of the £18.7bn already pledged, to be paid for in part by raising bills 59%, including inflation. The regulator has indicated it is reluctant to impose large increases on struggling households.

Investors will be combing Ofwat’s draft for an indication on the weighted average cost of capital it will allow companies, allowing them to calculate their returns. Last time round, some water firms successfully appealed Ofwat’s findings to the Competition and Markets Authority.

The documents will also be scrutinised to see whether the regulator will allow companies to build less than they promised, or the same projects at a cheaper cost, amid an industry pledge to spend £96bn on infrastructure, from new reservoirs to sewage treatment plants.

Thames, which serves about 16m households, is also due to publish its much anticipated annual results imminently. Sources said they were keen to examine whether the accounts, and those of the diverse collection of companies in Thames’s complex group structure, will be signed off on a going-concern basis, and whether they include a “material uncertainty” statement, as last year’s figures from parent company Kemble did. A source said the accounts were expected to be signed off at a board meeting on Friday and published by 15 July.

Investors hope the various publications could clarify the prospects for the group. Options still include a complex restructure, a debt-for-equity swap and a government-handled special administration – in effect a temporary renationalisation.

A source close to Kemble’s creditors said: “Obviously, the draft determinations are just a draft, but it will spark some activity.”

Colm Gibson, managing director at Berkeley Research, said: “Analysts and investors should be wary of reading too much into Ofwat’s draft determinations, as there is scope for Ofwat’s position to move materially before final determinations are revealed in December.”

He added: “Water companies have proposed large increases in their investment programmes just as they will face increased competition for staff and supply chain resources from the energy industry’s net zero programme, and a new government keen to invest in schools, hospitals, transport and other national … infrastructure. It will be interesting to see how this is taken into account in prices.”

This week, Reynolds said he “wouldn’t want to see a nationalisation” of Thames. “I think there should be a solution that involves [something] short of that,” he told an event in the City of London, without specifying what that solution might be.

Unfortunately for him, a testing financial squeeze at Thames may banish any post-victory party atmosphere before the balloons have even deflated.","If Labour triumphs in this week’s election, as polls suggest, then top of the incoming business secretary Jonathan Reynolds’s in-tray will be the possible collapse of Thames Water.

The Indian owner of the vast south Wales steelworks said on Thursday that it intended to cease operations at two blast furnaces on the site by 7 July – three days after the general election – in response to strike action announced by Unite members from 8 July. The company had planned to shut one furnace by the end of June and a second by September.

About 1,500 workers across Port Talbot and another site at Llanwern intend to strike over Tata’s decision to close its blast furnaces, cutting 2,800 jobs.

The company said: “We cannot be certain that we are able to continue to safely operate our assets in a stable fashion through the period of strike action.”

A Tata Steel spokesperson called on Unite to cancel the industrial action and said it had began legal action to “challenge the validity of Unite’s ballot”. Tata called on Unite to consider “the company’s proposed memorandum of understanding, which puts forward a wide-ranging proposal including generous employee support packages, training, and skills development”.

The decision has angered politicians and unions, who have argued that the Tata should wait until after next Thursday’s general election, which Labour is predicted to win.

Rachel Reeves, the shadow chancellor, and Jonathan Reynolds, the shadow business secretary, have pledged up to £3bn to support the industry’s transition to low carbon steel production, which is expected to include honouring an existing £500m package of government support for Port Talbot. A new electric arc furnace will be built by the end of 2027.

Torsten Bell, the former chief executive of the Resolution Foundation thinktank who is standing as Labour candidate for Swansea West, said on X that Tata’s decision was “incredibly worrying”.

He wrote: “Safety is of course paramount but Tata should avoid taking any action that cannot be reversed before seeing the result of the general election.

“We need to see everyone getting round the table. It is crucial we don’t lose the chance for the company and unions to sit down with an incoming Labour government, given the commitment from [Reynolds] and [Reeves] to a £2.5bn steel renewal fund.”

Onay Kasab, Unite’s national lead officer, said the union had asked for a meeting to discuss how to operate the site safely during the industrial action – the first steel strikes in 40 years – since it was called last week. He said that meeting had happened on Friday morning and safety plans were still being discussed with the company.

Kasab said: “To issue that statement last night knowing full well the meeting was today – it’s about trying to create fear and uncertainty among the workforce. Safety is paramount. Our argument is that the blast furnace does not have to be turned off before the electric arc furnace comes on, so of course we are not going to take action which means it is turned off.

“We are calling for the decision-makers in Mumbai to get involved in the discussions and we want Labour to stick to their commitment.”

Alun Davies, the national officer for steel at the Community union, said: “We went ballistic when we saw the communication and asked for an urgent meeting. Reynolds needs to sit down with the company to see to quickly put things in place.”

Keir Starmer, when launching Labour’s election campaign in Wales last month, said he would “fight for every single job and fight for the future of steel in Wales”.

Vaughan Gething, leader of Welsh Labour, said: “We will not support the closure of both furnaces. This will cause huge anxiety for the workforce, their families and the community. He added: “Urgent and good faith negotiations are required to ensure safety on site and avoid a severe and lasting impact on Port Talbot, Wales and the UK.”

Greenpeace UK’s head of climate, Mel Evans, said: “Tata should be listening to its steelworkers, not slamming the door behind them as soon as they threaten to walk out.

“A better deal for green primary steelmaking is possible, and with less than one week to go until the UK elects a new and, potentially, more sympathetic government, closing the steelworks before those newly elected ministers have sat down at the negotiating table is a costly mistake.

“It will have devastating consequences for the thousands of steelworkers set to lose their jobs, for the local community, and for steel production in the UK.”","Labour politicians have been urged to step in to help avert a “costly mistake” by Tata Steel, which has told staff it could close operations at its steel plant in Port Talbot just days after the general election.
About 1,500 workers across Port Talbot and another site at Llanwern intend to strike over Tata’s decision to close its blast furnaces, cutting 2,800 jobs.
The decision has angered politicians and unions, who have argued that the Tata should wait until after next Thursday’s general election, which Labour is predicted to win.

The Guardian,https://www.theguardian.com/business/article/2024/jun/30/better-economic-news-will-not-stop-tories-from-suffering-their-biggest-ever-defeat,2024-06-30,10:14:41 UTC,Better economic news will not stop Tories from suffering their biggest ever defeat | Larry Elliott,"Down the years the Conservative party has taken some heavy election beatings but the one in prospect this week could be of a different order of magnitude.

Assuming the polls are right – and they have been consistent since the start of the campaign – the Tories will do worse even than in 1906, their previous nadir. Back then, the Conservatives and their Liberal Unionist allies won just 156 seats, a repeat of which on Thursday would now be considered a good result.

But in 1906, Arthur Balfour’s outgoing government secured more than 43% of the vote, while Rishi Sunak is polling at about half that level. And Balfour’s defeat could at least be attributed to a policy issue – free trade versus protectionism. Today, voters just seem sick of the Tories.

News on the economy since the election was called has had little or no impact on the polls. In part, that’s because the signals have been mixed: inflation fell back to its 2% target and growth in the first quarter of 2024 has been revised up, but the economy stagnated in April and unemployment has increased.

Living standards are certainly improving. The Resolution Foundation thinktank calculates that real per capita household disposable income – a guide to whether people are getting better off after inflation is taken into account – rose by 2.4% over the past year.

That’s the good news. The bad news is that over the 2019-24 parliament as a whole, living standards fell by 0.6% and one of the unwritten rules of political economy is that governments don’t remain popular when voters are getting poorer.

Only twice in the past century have living standards been lower at the end of a parliament than when it commenced: in 1918-22, when the UK suffered from a post-first world war boom-bust, and in the short parliament of 1950-51, when inflation rose sharply as a result of the rearmament programme for the Korean war.

In the inevitable postmortem examination that will follow the election, attention will focus on whether the Tories might have done better had Sunak delayed the election so that in time more voters would have come to think an economic corner genuinely had been turned. Another quarter or two of rising living standards would not have saved the Conservatives from defeat but it would probably have limited the scale of it.

As it is, Rachel Reeves will be the beneficiary. Analysts have been revising up their growth estimates for 2024 and 2025 on the basis that consumers will start to run down the precautionary savings they accumulated during the cost of living crisis.

Other recent developments – especially those overseas – are not so welcome. Joe Biden’s poor performance in his head to head debate with Donald Trump has made it more likely that the latter will win the US presidential election. Tariffs will be raised and taxes will be cut if that happens, threatening higher inflation and rising debt.

Meanwhile, the first round of voting in France’s parliamentary election looks set to show sizeable gains for Marine Le Pen’s rightwing National Rally party and a defeat for Emmanuel Macron’s centrist government.

Events in both the US and France highlight how things have changed in the near decade and a half since Labour was last in power.

Most obviously, the world has become a less safe place. The war between Ukraine and Russia is now well into its third year and has shattered the notion that permanent peace can be guaranteed for western developed nations. There are always demands for Labour governments to spend more on the NHS and on the welfare state. This time there will also be pressure to raise defence spending.

Globalisation has gone into retreat. Weak growth since the financial crisis of 2008-09 has seen a marked increase in protectionist measures – not just on goods but on people too. In Europe, North America and Australasia alike there have been demands for governments to restrict the number of foreign nationals entering the country.

What’s more, multilateral bodies are for the most part weaker than they were in 2010. The increasingly fractious relationship between the US and China means the G20 group of leading developed and developing nations cannot agree on much. The World Trade Organization is a much-diminished institution, unable to fulfil either of its core functions: to negotiate multilateral trade deals and be the final arbiter in trade disputes. The EU is having to contend with rising nationalist sentiment, a function of feeble economic performance and a reaction against rule by unelected technocrats.

The developing world has been even harder hit by Covid and the cost of living crisis than the rich west, increasing the incentive for migrants to look for a better life elsewhere. Yet aid budgets have been cut and promises to help poor countries cope with the impact of climate change have not been fulfilled. The world is getting hotter and the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank urgently need more money to meet demands for their assistance.

So those are the sort of challenges that Labour will face when it takes office later this week. Not the world of 1997, when Russia was seen as an ally rather than a strategic threat. Not the middle of the Great Moderation – the period between the fall of communism and the global financial crisis – when the west enjoyed year after year of growth and low inflation, but rather a world still trying to claw its way out of the Great Stagnation of the past 15 years.

And an angrier world where voters can quickly turn on their governments. Labour should enjoy its honeymoon period. It might not last long.","And Balfour’s defeat could at least be attributed to a policy issue – free trade versus protectionism.

The Guardian,https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/article/2024/jun/30/labour-needs-billions-to-fund-its-plans-and-i-know-where-it-can-be-found,2024-06-30,08:00:16 UTC,Labour needs billions to fund its plans – and I know where it can be found | Will Hutton,"Since its foundation in 1900, the Labour party has had a Janus-headed attitude to capitalism. It needs capitalism to be successful, dynamic and job creating, even while it instinctively distrusts capitalism, with its capacity to generate extreme inequality, invest too little, cut corners and treat workers exploitatively. But its past efforts at improving things – nationalisation, top-down planning, championing strong trade unions or simply (as New Labour did) largely giving capitalism its head – have not been notably successful. It has been a standoff that the Conservative party has ruthlessly exploited.

The seismic importance of 4 July is that Conservatism’s approach to wealth generation – trying to shrink the state whose size and excess taxes supposedly “crowds out” suppressed investment and enterprise – is exposed as a dead end of stagnant living standards and eviscerated public services. Keir Starmer, boxed in by this dreadful legacy, has declared that Labour will become the party of growth and wealth generation. Only thus can sustained tax revenues be generated to repair the ravages of the past 14 years. My bet is that he has a better than even chance of pulling it off – and transforming Labour into Britain’s natural party of government.

His first advantage is that the economic evidence is unambiguous: the state does not “crowd out” investment, and low taxes do little to stimulate enterprise. What capitalism needs from the state is well-designed and stable policy that proactively manages the business cycle while “crowding in” innovation, infrastructure and abundant fit-for-purpose training, and shapes the savings system to deliver buoyant company share prices – the necessary if insufficient precondition for raising capital to enable higher investment and a startup and scale-up boom.

This is becoming the new common sense in business, finance and the financial markets. It is why investors are buying shares anticipating a Labour government, and why Dame Amanda Blanc, CEO of Aviva, suggested last week that there could be as much as £100bn from UK insurers ready to flow into business investment if chancellor Rachel Reeves can deliver her promises on stability. That alone would go some way to lift British public and private investment by £100bn every year – the scale of the gap between us and our major competitors – while not risking another Liz Truss-style fiasco.

One important avenue to growth, cited in the Labour manifesto, is the prospect of unleashing some of the £1.4tn funds fossilised in Britain’s 5,100 defined benefit pension fund schemes. Linked to a generous fraction of workers’ final year’s pay, they have become a financial burden. To wind them up, companies have closed them to new members, creating a £1.4tn universe of wholly risk-averse zombie funds. They need to be consolidated into bigger funds that can take risks – and the money made to work to accelerate Britain’s investment recovery.

There is the tool to hand. One of the most startling policy successes of the past 20 years has been New Labour’s Pension Protection Fund (PPF), established in 2005, which takes over the management of distressed defined benefit pension funds, guaranteeing the future pensions. Managed with great professionalism, the PPF has already consolidated more than 1,100 pension funds and is currently worth £33bn with a £12bn investment surplus – one of the most successful funds of its type globally in securing high investment performance. Industry insiders believe that there is another £600bn locked up in small, high-cost zombie funds that could be liberated for productive investment.

The first staging post would be to scale up the current PPF to at least £100bn. Conservative objections that this would leave the pension funds with no fiscal backstop can be easily overcome; backed by the state, the PPF will become the new backstop via a guarantee that does not score as public borrowing. Nor, because the PPF is so rich, would the state ever be at risk. Reeves will be on her way.

Britain would have an investment trio of financial institutions dedicated to multibillion-pound economic development

After all, such a guarantee is already delegated to the UK Infrastructure Bank (UKIB) to underwrite £10bn of commercial bank lending on infrastructure projects. Reeves should lift the facility to £50bn. A similar guarantee would enable the British Business Bank (BBB) to offer venture debt to startups and scale-ups, and seek out promising companies to back: there is an estimated annual shortage of up to £10bn of venture lending that needs to be closed. My understanding is that a scaled-up PPF would support both the UKIB and BBB; at a stroke, Britain would have equipped itself with an investment trio of financial institutions dedicated to serious multibillion-pound economic development and resultant growth – without additional direct government borrowing. It’s a fiscal get-out-of-jail-free card.

Against this background, Reeves can use her proposed rewriting of the fiscal rules to supplement public investment directly. The Financial Times recently reported that asset managers would buy an extra £20bn-£30bn of government debt if it were earmarked for investment projects and R&D. Altogether, the UK’s growth rate could accelerate to above 2.5% by the end of the parliament, with even the dropped £28bn target for green spending met. Growth would be higher again the more Britain regained access to lost EU markets.

In the near future, before growth kicks in, Starmer and Reeves may have to increase the current yields from capital gains, inheritance and council tax by up to another 1% of GDP. But overall there will be the funds to resuscitate education, the NHS, local government, defence, the criminal justice system, the arts and welfare. Do I dream? Some commitments are in the manifesto, others set out in Reeves’ Mais lecture in March, others have not been excluded during the election campaign, and the ambitious teams in the investment trio are all standing by for the call.

Some in the Treasury will oppose. And never underestimate the conservatism and parochialism of the pension fund world. Geopolitics may kill all hopes. But Britain under Labour could at last fulfil its economic promise and build a high-investment, inclusive, high-wage capitalism that treats its workers fairly. This time, no mistakes.","Since its foundation in 1900, the Labour party has had a Janus-headed attitude to capitalism.

The Guardian,https://www.theguardian.com/business/article/2024/jun/30/if-workers-rights-are-a-bit-french-as-the-tories-suggest-then-vive-la-revolution,2024-06-30,06:00:14 UTC,"If workers’ rights are ‘a bit French’, as the Tories suggest, then vive la révolution | Heather Stewart","To the stirring strains of the Marseillaise, a monochrome Angela Rayner reels off her plans for workers’ rights, as a red beret and a Gallic moustache jiggle around her head. “Angela Rayner’s Britain?” demands the title, alongside a tiny tricolour.

Tory messaging has become ever more bizarre as this gaffe-strewn campaign lurches towards a close, but Thursday’s example, warning that Labour may make the UK’s labour market un peu French, hit new heights of weirdness.

For one thing, the mention of France seems more likely to evoke pleasant holidays than picket lines. More importantly, polling suggests the policies Rayner set out in the clip – employment rights from day one of a job, banning fire and rehire, binning bogus self-employment – are popular with the public.

Recent TUC polling found that two-thirds of people supported employees having the right to unfair dismissal from day one – including 61% of 2019 Tory voters. Similarly, two-thirds were in favour of a ban on fire and rehire.

Two things probably underlie the groundswell of opinion that tougher rules are needed in the labour market. One is the plain fact that too many people have found themselves working hard and still un­able to make ends meet. Real wage growth has been all but stagnant for the best part of 15 years, with average earnings a pathetic £16 a week higher than in 2010 – despite significant increases in the minimum wage (rebranded as the “national living wage”) under successive Conservative governments.

Against that backdrop, it is hardly surprising some feel the balance has tipped too far from workers to employers – a sentiment that perhaps also partly explains the ­support for public sector strikes last year.

It is more than that, however: there is a sense not just of a lack of bargaining power, but of unfairness, injustice even, in the way the labour market works for those trapped at the bottom.

From “self-employed” gig economy workers summarily laid off via an app to social care staff exploited by rogue employers and shift workers unable to plan childcare because of last-minute changes, there is an infuriating impotence about so many people’s interactions with the labour market. That is only likely to increase as new technologies are used to monitor and even manage workers as they go about their jobs.

In theory, Labour’s new deal for working people should help to turn the tide, particularly when combined with the tougher approach to enforcement Rayner has promised.

Social care is set to be the testing ground for a new approach of “fair pay agreements” under which employers and unions will have to hammer out terms and conditions that ministers will then apply across the sector.

Unions will be given the right to enter workplaces and make the case for membership – something the GMB has only just won at Amazon’s Coventry warehouse under strict conditions as part of a statutory ballot. And a new Labour government would consult about establishing a single employment status, abolishing the halfway house of “worker”, which comes with more obligations than rights.

As with so many areas of Labour’s agenda, however, the details will be critical – as will timing. Fair pay agreements were introduced in New Zealand in 2022, but implementation took so long that not a single one had come into force before the government changed and the plan was scrapped.

When, as seems likely, Rayner arrives at her desk as deputy prime minister on Friday, she will face intense pressure to water down the plans from business groups – and from some in her own party.

The Tory attack video ­echoed a line that originated with the CBI’s president, Rupert Soames, that Labour is poised to create a “European model” for the labour market. It is worth stressing how far away the UK is from that at present: Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development data suggests that 26% of workers here are covered by collective bargaining, for example, compared with 100% in Italy, 98% in France and 54% in Germany.

Regulation of the labour market has the potential to change millions of people’s lives for the better

But Soames’s concerns will find an echo among some in Labour. Furious unions confronted the party earlier this year over what they saw as an effort to undermine the new deal for workers – with union insiders claiming the shadow chancellor, Rachel Reeves, was keen to burnish her business credentials by being seen to push back against the plans. A fragile peace broke out after a face-to-face meeting between union general secretaries and shadow cabinet members, including Keir Starmer, but much about the fine details will only become clear the other side of the election.

The necessity to regain business backing has been a key part of Labour’s plan to win Thursday’s vote. If it succeeds, as polls suggest, the question facing the party on Friday will be a very different one: how to wield that power?

Regulation of the labour market is knotty, unglamorous and the subject of intense lobbying, but it has the potential to change millions of people’s lives for the better. Rayner should embrace the beret, face down the doubters and be bold.","Tory messaging has become ever more bizarre as this gaffe-strewn campaign lurches towards a close, but Thursday’s example, warning that Labour may make the UK’s labour market un peu French, hit new heights of weirdness.
Two things probably underlie the groundswell of opinion that tougher rules are needed in the labour market.

The Guardian,https://www.theguardian.com/business/article/2024/jun/27/labours-growth-strategy-the-devil-lies-not-in-planning-but-in-implementation,2024-06-27,07:34:41 UTC,"Labour’s growth strategy: the devil lies not in planning, but in implementation","As in many other developed countries lately, the two major political parties in the UK have embraced economic growth as their top policy priority. After the volatile 49-day experience of Liz Truss’s government and its “dash for growth” in 2022, however, both parties emphasise that there are no financial shortcuts. The focus, instead, is on devising measures to boost productivity, resource allocation, and growth over the long term. In this respect, the opposition Labour party is ahead of the ruling Conservatives, though both are still working out the details of actual implementation.

Buoyant, durable, sustainable and inclusive growth is essential for a country where the older generations risk seeing their children end up worse off than they are. That has not happened in many decades. Only growth can deliver the resources needed to enhance living standards, improve public services, support sustainable energy initiatives, limit the scale of generalised tax increases, and combat inequality of wealth, income and opportunity.

In short, it is all about increasing the safe speed limit for economic growth. The Bank of England estimates the UK economy’s potential growth may be as low as 1%. At that speed, much that ails the country is likely to get worse, rather than better, over time. Moreover, this already weak growth potential could deteriorate even further if the problem is left to fester.

There is no singular, silver-bullet initiative that can change this outlook. Many British politicians are still haunted by the Truss saga, when the newly arrived prime minister tried to use unfunded tax cuts as a stimulus, only to create a damaging episode of financial instability. It is now widely acknowledged that after so many years of insufficient investment and sagging productivity, achieving high-quality growth requires a comprehensive policy approach that builds on many intermediate objectives.

The Labour party has gone further in specifying such structural reforms. Its programme includes proposals to revamp the planning system, boost infrastructure, improve trade links, crowd in domestic and foreign private investment (including through an energised National Wealth Fund), remove tax distortions, and pursue sector-specific initiatives. The party has also identified promising public-private partnerships geared toward enhancing investible funds, while encouraging innovation and efficiency.

Labour has indicated it would try to “hardwire” many of these reforms by strengthening existing institutions. To ensure all its policies remain compatible with financial stability, it has committed to adhere to the same public-debt “rule” as the current Conservative party.

The challenge now is to devise a detailed execution plan, one that includes a high-frequency monitoring system to provide real-time feedback and allow for timely course corrections, if needed. Any economic policy roadmap must favour comprehensive over piecemeal reforms. Such reforms should be implemented simultaneously, rather than sequentially, and they should come sooner rather than later.

As Labour demonstrated with its successful takeoff after coming to power in 1997, a new growth emphasis would benefit from serious credibility-enhancing steps. That is what then-chancellor of the exchequer Gordon Brown did with his surprising and insightful decision to hand over the reins of interest rate policy to the Bank of England, thus enshrining the principle of central bank independence.

One must hope that the current Labour leadership has not ruled out too much policy flexibility in its pursuit of a decisive election victory. Some of the most powerful measures that it is proposing would require resources upfront, but their growth and financial benefits would materialise only over time. The next government will also find itself confronting a more complicated, increasingly fragmented international system, and it will need to secure consistent buy-in from the private sector, which ultimately must do most of the heavy lifting.

Another, related task is to improve the functioning of existing growth engines while also supporting the development of the sectors and industries that will drive growth in the future. Striking a proper balance may prove to be the most difficult part of the challenge, given the country’s resource constraints and the fact that some key initiatives are better pursued at a regional level. (With its lack of sufficient robust regional initiatives to drive innovation in artificial intelligence, life sciences, and sustainable energy, the European Union faces a similar problem.)

Promoting high, durable, sustainable and inclusive growth was never going to be easy after so many years of neglect. The need to revamp the UK’s existing growth engines and simultaneously kickstart new ones makes the task even more complicated. But to paraphrase the US president John F Kennedy’s famous moonshot speech, the winning party must do these and “other things, not because they are easy, but because they are hard”.

The Guardian,https://www.theguardian.com/business/article/2024/jun/29/ai-drive-brings-microsofts-green-moonshot-down-to-earth-in-west-london,2024-06-29,09:00:48 UTC,AI drive brings Microsoft’s ‘green moonshot’ down to earth in west London,"If you want evidence of Microsoft’s progress towards its environmental “moonshot” goal, then look closer to earth: at a building site on a west London industrial estate.

The company’s Park Royal datacentre is part of its commitment to drive the expansion of artificial intelligence (AI), but that ambition is jarring with its target of being carbon negative by 2030.

Microsoft says the centre will be run fully on renewable energy. However, the construction of datacentres and the servers they are filled with means that the company’s scope 3 emissions – such as CO 2 related to the materials in its buildings and the electricity people consume when using products such as Xbox – are more than 30% above their 2020 level. As a result, the company is exceeding its overall emissions target by roughly the same rate.

This week, Microsoft’s co-founder, Bill Gates, claimed AI would help combat climate change because big tech is “seriously willing” to pay extra to use clean electricity sources in order “to say that they’re using green energy”.

In the short term, AI has been problematic for Microsoft’s green goals. Brad Smith, Microsoft’s outspoken president, once called its carbon ambitions a “moonshot”. In May, stretching that metaphor to breaking point, he admitted that because of its AI strategy, “the moon has moved”. It plans to spend £2.5bn over the next three years on growing its AI datacentre infrastructure in the UK and this year has announced new datacentre projects around the world including in the US, Japan, Spain and Germany.

Training and operating the AI models that underpin products such as OpenAI’s ChatGPT and Google’s Gemini uses a lot of electricity to power and cool the associated hardware, with additional carbon generated by making and transporting the related equipment.

“It is a technology that is driving up energy consumption,” says Alex de Vries, the founder of Digiconomist, a website monitoring the environmental impact of new technologies.

The International Energy Agency estimates that datacentres’ total electricity consumption could double from 2022 levels to 1,000 TWh (terawatt hours) in 2026, equivalent to the energy demand of Japan. AI will result in datacentres using 4.5% of global energy generation by 2030, according to calculations by research firm SemiAnalysis.

It means that amid the concerns about AI’s impact on jobs and humanity’s longevity, the environment is featuring, too. Last week, the International Monetary Fund said governments should consider imposing carbon taxes to capture the environmental cost of AI, in the form of a general carbon levy that captures emissions from servers as part of its reach, or other methods such as a specific tax on CO 2 generated by that equipment.

All the big tech firms involved in AI – Meta, Google, Amazon, Microsoft – are seeking renewable energy resources to meet their climate targets. In January, Amazon, the world’s largest corporate purchaser of renewable energy, announced it had bought more than half the output of an offshore windfarm in Scotland, while Microsoft said in May it was backing $10bn (£7.9bn) in renewable energy projects. Google aims to run its datacentres entirely on carbon-free energy by 2030.

A spokesperson for Microsoft said: “We remain resolute in our commitment to meet our climate goals.”

Microsoft co-founder Bill Gates, who left in 2020 but retains a stake in the company via the Gates Foundation Trust, has argued that AI can directly help fight climate change. The extra electricity demand would be matched by new investments in green generation, he said on Thursday, which would more than compensate for the use.

A recent UK government-backed report agreed, stating that the “carbon intensity of the energy source is a key variable” in calculating AI-related emissions, although it adds that “a significant portion of AI training globally still relies on high-carbon sources such as coal or natural gas”. The water needed to cool servers is also an issue, with one study estimating that AI could account for up to 6.6bn cubic meters of water use by 2027 – nearly two-thirds of England’s annual consumption.

De Vries argues that the chase for sustainable computing power puts a strain on demand for renewable energy, which would result in fossil fuels picking up the slack in other sections of the global economy.

“More energy consumption means we don’t have enough renewables to feed that increase,” he says.

NexGen Cloud, a UK firm that provides sustainable cloud computing, a datacentre-reliant industry that delivers IT services such as data storage and computing power over the internet, says renewable energy sources for AI-related computing are available for datacentres if they avoid cities and are sited next to sources of hydro or geothermal power.

Youlian Tzanev, NexGen Cloud’s co-founder, says:

“The industry norm has been to build around economic hubs rather than sources of renewable energy.”

This makes it more difficult for any AI-focused tech company to hit carbon goals. Amazon, the world’s biggest cloud computing provider, aims to be net zero – removing as much carbon as it emits – by 2040 and to match its global electricity use with 100% renewable energy by 2025. Google and Meta are pursuing the same net zero goal by 2030. OpenAI, the developer of ChatGPT, uses Microsoft datacentres to train and operate its products.

There are two key ways in which large language models – the technology that underpins chatbots such as ChatGPT or Gemini – consume energy. The first is the training phase, where a model is fed reams of data culled from the internet and beyond, and builds a statistical understanding of language itself, which ultimately enables it to churn out convincing-looking answers to queries.

The upfront energy cost of training AI is astronomical. That keeps smaller companies (and even smaller governments) from competing in the sector, if they do not have a spare $100m to throw at a training run. But it is dwarfed by the cost of actually running the resulting models, a process known as “inference”. According to analyst Brent Thill, at the investment firm Jefferies, 90% of the energy cost of AI sits in that inference phase: the electricity used when people ask an AI system to respond to factual queries, summarise a chunk of text or write an academic essay.

The electricity used for training and inference is funnelled through an enormous and growing digital infrastructure. The datacentres are filled with servers, which are built from the ground up for the specific part of the AI workload they sit in. A single training server may have a central processing unit (CPU) barely more powerful than the one in your own computer, paired with tens of specialised graphics processing units (GPUs) or tensor processing units (TPUs) – microchips designed to rapidly plough through the vast quantities of simple calculations that AI models are made of.

If you use a chatbot, as you watch it spit out answers word by word, a powerful GPU is using about a quarter of the power required to boil a kettle. All of this is being hosted by a datacentre, whether owned by the AI provider itself or a third party – in which case it might be called “the cloud”, a fancy name for someone else’s computer.

SemiAnalysis estimates that if generative AI was integrated into every Google search this could translate into annual energy consumption of 29.2 TWh, comparable with what Ireland consumes in a year, although the financial cost to the tech company would be prohibitive. That has led to speculation that the search company may start charging for some AI tools.

But some argue that looking at the energy overhead for AI is the wrong lens. Instead, consider the energy the new tools can save. A provocative paper in Nature’s peer-reviewed Scientific Reports journal earlier this year argued that the carbon emissions of writing and illustrating are lower for AI than for humans.

AI systems emit “between 130 and 1,500 times” less carbon dioxide a page of text generated compared with human writers, the researchers from University of California Irvine estimated, and up to 2,900 times less an image.

Left unsaid, of course, is what those human writers and illustrators are doing instead. Redirecting and retraining their labour in another field – such as green jobs – could be another moonshot.","If you want evidence of Microsoft’s progress towards its environmental “moonshot” goal, then look closer to earth: at a building site on a west London industrial estate.

Alongside football, she has had to pull her four children out of cadets, dancing, and say no to other requests like gymnastics and horse riding because of the costs.

“The middle two children do notice how stressful things can be. My son will cry and he’ll say, ‘mum, why are you so upset?’ And I’ll just say it’s one of those things, it’s hard.” Carol is a part-time teaching assistant and exam invigilator living in Wiltshire, and is one of 422,000 families affected by the two-child limit to benefits.

The two-child limit legislation means that a family with a third or subsequent child born from 6 April 2017 claiming universal credit or child tax credit no longer receives additional amounts for these children. Currently, one in 10 children are affected by it and it is considered a key driver of poverty in the UK. We spent six months with families across the country to build a picture of the impact of this rule on day-to-day family life. Parents talked frequently of fairness and were at pains to explain how they must treat all children the same, even if the government doesn’t.

“You can’t give money to one and not the other and it’s not their fault they were born after the government brought a rule in.” Carol’s children are 16, 11, eight and four and has supported her family on her own on the wage she brings in, and on universal credit.

She works three days a week, and gets £909 a month in the child element of universal credit for three children - her eldest was born pre-2016 so has always been eligible for payments. In May, her income was £2,753 in total for her and the four children, and her rent is £1,140. Earlier this month, she got married, which means universal credit payments will reduce when she starts living with her new partner.

“I could work more hours, but when would I see them and I need to make sure there’s a decent meal on the table,” she says.

In Manchester, mother-of-three Leanne, receives £584.58 a month for her two eldest sons from universal credit, but not for her daughter, six. Altogether, she is living on £1,200 a month with shopping, gas and electric bills, council tax, water, TV licence coming out of that and travel costs to the local hospital to take one of her sons to various appointments.

“The rule came into force in the April of 2017 and I had my daughter in the October. I thought ‘how am I going to support her through two children’s money?’

“I think it was as she was getting older and going on to solid foods and we needed more money for shopping. I also had my second boy, who was only young then, so that was two kids in nappies at home,” shesays.

Her eldest boys, 11 and eight, also love football and go and play at the local park, and at the local football club as much as they can. She also takes them to all the free activities that are put on locally, and saves money on food where she can.

“More parents are struggling because of this rule and more parents are behind on rent, housing. People can’t afford shopping. I do struggle.

“I never suffered from any anxiety until I had my youngest daughter.”

The UK government’s universal credit payments are now set at £333.33 for a first child if they were born before 6 April 2017, and £287.92 if they were born after that date. The payment for a second child is also £287.92.

Its plan includes a promise to build new towns but what would it take to pull it off?

“I think the new towns idea is very grabbing,” Robert Booth, the Guardian’s social affairs correspondent, tells Hannah Moore. “To build genuine new settlements, which are sufficiently large to have all the infrastructure, all the character, all the sense of place of a town or even a small city, rather than just another housing estate.”

However, it’s not clear how Labour would achieve this policy.

“The level of detail that Labour have put out about this is thin,” says Booth. “We don’t know where these might be, we don’t know very much about how they would be funded or delivered, and how long it would take to do that.”

Booth explains how Labour plans to change the planning laws to allow for more building, including on some greenbelt land. He reports from Hitchin, North Hertfordshire, where former greenbelt land is already zoned for over 2,000 new homes. He meets residents who are worried about the destruction of nature and the loss of identity for the hamlets there. He also meets renters who are struggling.

The Guardian,https://www.theguardian.com/money/article/2024/jun/29/unpaid-uk-carers-financial-hit-income-benefits-bills,2024-06-29,06:00:49 UTC,Unpaid UK carers ‘face financial hit that can last decades’,"People who look after family members free of charge are taking a huge hit to their finances which could continue into their retirement as they find themselves unable to balance paid work with their caring commitments.

Recent analysis of official figures by the financial firm Just Retirement found seven in 10 people who were receiving carer’s allowance were not in paid work, and missing out on earnings and private pension contributions.

Andresearch last year by the charity Carers UK found that 40% of those providing high levels of care for an ill, elderly or disabled relative or friend had left their employment, while 22% had reduced their working hours.

“Too often for unpaid carers in work, the immense stresses and challenges of the role with little support can mean having to reduce working hours or come out of the workplace altogether,” says Helen Walker, the chief executive of Carers UK. “This can have a significant impact on household finances, exacerbated by the current cost of living crisis.”

With just days to go until the election, the party that looks most likely to take power has said very little about what it would do to help the UK’s army of unpaid carers. The Labour manifesto does not include a single mention of the word “carer”. The Conservative manifesto does include a few brief mentions. Only the Liberal Democrats have put forward substantial proposals for better support.

Carer’s allowance is now worth £81.90 a week and is available to people who provide at least 35 hours a week of care to a disabled person.

Carers UK has been conducting an annual survey for several years, each time asking people about the impact of their role on their finances. Last year, it found 75% of those receiving carer’s allowance were struggling with cost-of-living pressures, with almost half cutting back on essentials including food and heating. The proportion saying that they were struggling to make ends meet had risen to 45%, from 39% in 2022.

The survey found that 72% were worried about the financial hit from expenses linked to caring, such as petrol for hospital visits, heating and specific dietary requirements.

Those who were employed worked in low-paid jobs as a result of the strict rules around carer’s allowance. An earnings limit means you do not qualify if you earn more than £151 a week – after that, you lose the entire benefit. The Guardian has revealed that carers who have inadvertently earned more have been taken to court by the Department for Work and Pensions.

Carers UK and Just Retirement say that these rules make it hard for people to stay in paid work.

“Removing unnecessary pressures and ensuring those who can, and want to, remain in paid work is essential,” Walker says.

She says the low level of the payments doesn’t recognise what carers do, “and there are clear problems in the way that it’s delivered, making even small amounts of work challenging. Raising the earnings limit is something that would help more carers to stay in paid work and help avoid some devastating overpayments.”

Stephen Lowe from Just Retirement says carer’s allowance was never intended to be a “wage” or payment for caring services. “However, if the rules are stopping or limiting people from taking up employment and earnings opportunities that are available to them, then we have to question whether it is fit for purpose.”

He warns that if people restrict their work or give it up entirely to provide care, “that loss of income and other work benefits such as employer pension contributions is likely to have an impact on their lives for decades to come, as well as on the businesses who lose key staff.”

Among proposals in the party manifestos for next week’s general election are a pledge by the Lib Dems to increase carer’s allowance by £20 a week and to introduce a new earnings taper of £183, after which carers would start to lose some of their allowance. Labour has previously said it would review the system but included no details in its election pledges.

Walker says that without better support for working carers, the problems they face will show no sign of abating.

“The last decade has seen a significant rise in the number of hours of unpaid care being provided and a reduction in social care available,” she says. “Our recent YouGov research revealed that 62% of UK adults – the equivalent of 10 million current or former unpaid carers – said they have had no choice about taking on an unpaid caring role.”","Carers UK has been conducting an annual survey for several years, each time asking people about the impact of their role on their finances.

While students are exempt from the tax during the course, they are liable to pay as soon as they finish their final year.

The UK government says student status ends the day after the close of a university’s summer term, usually at the beginning of June.

Student accommodation leases from private landlords typically run until late June, July or even August, and this discrepancy means the risk of a surprise bill.

Megan Lloyd, a debt expert at Citizens Advice, says: “Students become liable for council tax from the day after they formally stop being a student. This could be when their course officially ends, or the day after they abandon it or get dismissed from their studies.

“For example, if a student’s final term ends on 10 June, they will become liable for council tax from 11 June,” she says.

She adds: “This only applies to final-year students; students don’t have to pay council tax during the summer holidays between years of study.”

Manchester city council has already sent out letters billing graduating students for days since term ended. Other councils are less proactive.

A spokesperson for Council Tax Advisors said: “It’s advisable for students to check with their local council for precise details, as there can be variations in how councils handle the end of term exemptions and the start of council tax liability.”

Council tax bills are based on a property’s value so how much students could become liable for depends on the property they are renting.

According to Gov.uk, from 2024 to 2025, the average bill for a band D property (priced between £68,001 and £88,000 in value on 1 April 1991) will be £2,171 a year. This is about £181 a month – a lot when a third of students live off less than £50.

Students who receive a letter or due payment notice should take action so it does not result in a debt.

There can be serious consequences for council tax arrears, including legal action or a visit from a bailiff.

Students who can prove they are no longer living in the property may be able to get an exemption at their council’s discretion.

However, for the most part, those in this position will need to pay.

It is important for students to continue checking post, especially as their housemates begin to move out of their rented accommodation.","Final-year university students have been urged to check that they do not owe council tax for the last few weeks of their rented accommodation.

The Guardian,https://www.theguardian.com/money/article/2024/jun/28/savers-urged-to-open-inflation-beating-accounts-before-uk-interest-rates-fall,2024-06-28,07:00:15 UTC,Savers urged to open inflation-beating accounts before UK interest rates fall,"UK savers are being urged to lock into an inflation-beating savings account before interest rates start their downward journey.

A number of fixed-rate savings bonds currently pay 5%-plus – on these accounts your return is guaranteed and you will be earning more than twice the current rate of inflation.

However, with most analysts expecting the first Bank of England base rate cut in August or September, followed by several more over the next year or two, the rates available right now may not hang around for long, some commenters claim.

Mark Hicks, a savings expert at investment firm Hargreaves Lansdown, says: “This is a window of opportunity for savers, so now is the time to clamber in and grab a decent rate before it closes.”

Lucinda O’Brien, of the comparison website money.co.uk, has a similar message: “Now is the time to act, before it’s too late.”

Earlier this month it was announced that inflation measured by the consumer prices index (CPI) fell to 2% in May. It’s a far cry from the period in 2022 and 2023 when inflation was running at 10% to 11%, eating into the value of millions of people’s nest-eggs.

Many of the highest-paying savings accounts offering a rate of 5%-plus are fixed-rate deals where you have to tie your money up for 12 months.

At the time of writing, a number of players were offering one-year fixed-rate savings bonds paying 5.2% or more. These include the My Community Bank credit union and Union Bank of India (UK), both paying 5.22%; Vanquis Bank, offering 5.21%; and Close Brothers Savings, paying 5.2%.

These require a minimum deposit of £1,000, except Close Brothers Savings, which requires £10,000 to open an account.

However, Sarah Coles, the head of personal finance at Hargreaves Lansdown, says that while you can earn the most interest with a one-year fixed-rate account, “you would need to track down another fix when it matured [and] there’s a decent chance the rates on offer by then will be significantly lower”.

This is why two-year fixed savings bonds are looking attractive, she says. “You could consider tying up any cash you don’t need for two years, and making the most of the great rates while they’re around.”

On Thursday, the highest-paying two-year fixed-rate savings bonds were those offered by Vanquis Bank and Close Brothers Savings, paying 5.06% on minimum balances of £1,000 and £10,000 respectively.

Other providers offering two-year fixed savings accounts boasting best-buy rates included Hodge Bank (4.97%), Market Harborough building society (4.95%), and Atom Bank (4.9%). The minimum deposits for these are £1,000, £10,000 and £50 respectively.

“This is a really sensible time to consider locking in a fixed rate,” says Coles. She believes the Bank of England is not going to be in a hurry to cut rates, but they are likely to get progressively lower. “By the middle of next year [rates] are forecast to be 4.5%, and by the middle of 2026 they are expected to hit 4%.”

It is a good idea to review your savings rates anyway, if you have not done so during the past six to 12 months, says Rachel Springall, of the financial data provider Moneyfacts.

Loyalty “does not always pay”, and the average easy-access account interest rate paid across the biggest high street banks is 2.01%, which is 0.05% less than it was six months ago, based on a snapshot of rates on 19 June.","UK savers are being urged to lock into an inflation-beating savings account before interest rates start their downward journey.

The Guardian,https://www.theguardian.com/money/article/2024/jun/27/private-car-parks-uk-motorists-10-minute-grace-period-fines,2024-06-27,12:30:03 UTC,Private car parks to give UK motorists 10-minute grace period before fines,"Private car parks will offer motorists in the UK a 10-minute “grace period” before issuing fines, but motorists say the voluntary code is not enough to protect drivers from unfair practices.

The measure is part of a new code of practice that private car-park companies have promised to introduce in the autumn. Industry trade bodies will also implement a fairer appeals system and maintain an existing cap on charges of £100 – reduced to £60 if paid within 14 days.

However, motoring organisations have argued that the proposed code falls far short of the standards required and are calling for government legislation.

The AA’s head of roads policy, Jack Cousens, said: “This self-authored code doesn’t acknowledge the need to cap charges and remove debt recovery fees … These elements are desperately needed from a government-backed code to protect innocent drivers from the sharks running private car parks.”

The code was published by the British Parking Association and the International Parking Community, the two trade bodies representing private car-park operators.

It also includes requirements for more consistent signage and an “appeals charter” for drivers. The grace period means that vehicles in car parks will have 10 minutes after parking expires before being issued with a fine.

Parking companies will only be required to meet the new standards in full by December 2026.

Politicians and motorist groups have criticised private parking businesses – which issued 9.7m tickets between April and December last year – for unreasonable fees and misleading signage.

A bill to enable the introduction of a legislation-backed code of conduct received royal assent in March 2019. The legislation, which was withdrawn in 2022 after a legal challenge from private parking companies, included halving the cap on tickets for most parking offences to £50, among a number of other measures.

Simon Williams, the head of policy at the RAC, said: “Drivers shouldn’t be fooled into thinking this so-called code developed by the private parking industry itself is the same as the long-delayed official private parking code of practice that is backed by legislation.

“This, and only this, will bring an end to the worst practices of some private parking operators, and mean drivers – especially those who are vulnerable – are protected from unreasonable fines and debt collectors chasing down payments.”","Private car parks will offer motorists in the UK a 10-minute “grace period” before issuing fines, but motorists say the voluntary code is not enough to protect drivers from unfair practices.

The Guardian,https://www.theguardian.com/money/article/2024/jun/27/car-insurer-learner-driver-policy-collingwood,2024-06-27,06:00:30 UTC,Car insurer charged £40 to cancel learner driver policy,"I wanted to draw your, and your readers’, attention to something I think is extremely sharp practice by the insurance broker Collingwood.

I bought its annual learner driver policy for my son last year for £256.

Collingwood was clear that once he passed his driving test the policy would cease to be valid, which I understood.

In fact, it took my son almost the whole year before he passed, with only a few weeks of the policy left to run.

I was content to let it expire, in the knowledge that no partial refund would be due.

I was then very surprised to receive an email informing me that, since my son had passed his test, I now owed Collingwood a £40 “cancellation fee”.

I knew, in practice, no claim could now be made on it. I had paid the full premium upfront and owed nothing further.

Collingwood’s position is that the charge is included in its Ts and Cs, which I ticked when I bought the policy, and so is legitimate.

I see from different review websites that many people have been affected by this and are complaining they feel ripped off. I appreciate that cancellation fees may be appropriate when the consumer no longer wants the product, but charging £40 to basically allow a policy to lapse does not seem at all reasonable.

ML, by email

I couldn’t agree more. The company is, in effect, selling a policy that it expects the vast majority of its buyers will have to cancel before the end of the term, and is failing to explicitly mention this charge upfront.

It is likely doing so to make the policy look cheaper than it actually is in web comparisons. In my view, it is a hidden charge – one, as you say, that is catching out a lot of people.

I asked Collingwood about it and it says it was still looking into your complaint, made more than a month ago.

“The fee and conditions of cancellation are clearly presented in the customer journey prior to purchase, and also require an acknowledgment that they have been understood and accepted, before any policy can be purchased,” it said.

“With reference to the amount of the fee charged, this has been set with consideration to fair value and the consumer duty.”

If everyone who finds themselves on the wrong end of this £40 charge takes the matter to the Financial Ombudsman, the company will soon put it upfront on its website, which is what it should do anyway. Other potential Collingwood policy buyers take note of this shoddy behaviour.

In an announcement on Tuesday, the US Consumer Product Safety Commission said that the toy sets, which consist of spheres containing material required to assemble miniature imitations of appliance, food or lifestyle items, contain resin that, when liquid, can cause various physical issues.

The resin packaging in each set may imitate food items such as a peanut butter jar, maple syrup and a milk container and the resins when hardened imitate food, the CPSC said.

Each sphere consists of a disposable wrapper bearing the words “MGA’s Miniverse” on a yellow background and “Make It Appliances” or “Make It Mini Food” in bright pink, or “Make It Mini Lifestyle” in salmon pink. The wrapper contains information related to the manufacturer’s identity and country-specific information in different languages, CPSC added.

According to the CPSC, the resins contain acrylates, a chemical agent made from acrylic acid, in amounts prohibited in children’s products by the Federal Hazardous Substances Act. After the resins harden, they no longer pose a risk.

MGA Entertainment has received 26 reports of incidents with this product affecting children and adults. Those include reports of burns and irritation, respiratory irritation, as well as one report of a consumer’s asthma being triggered.

In addition to the toy sets being recalled across the US, there are 1m recalls that have been issued across Canada.

In a statement to CNN, the MGA Entertainment CEO, Isaac Larian, said that the product had been on the market for 18 months and that only 10% to 15% of the recalled products contain liquid resin.

From October 2022 through June 2024, the sets, which were manufactured in China and ranged in price from $7 to $13, were sold at Target, Walmart, Family Dollar, Dollar General, Aldi and Hobby Lobby, in addition to other stores and Amazon.com. Some sets were also sold in a box ranging in price from $14 to $52.

In an FAQ document posted online, MGA Entertainment said that the remedy upon returning a recalled set with unused resin is the consumer’s choice of a replacement product or a refund. MGA Entertainment also said it will pay for return shipping labels.

Our contract is for TV and broadband at £55 a month. We pay each month by direct debit and never use any extras or charged-for services. We have separate subscriptions for things like Netflix and Amazon Prime and pay for them directly.

In December, when we first received a bill with this extra £17.99, I contacted the firm and was told that I had added it to my package the previous month. I know I didn’t, as we were on holiday.

All my attempts since to get this removed have failed. Despite more than 20 different advisers assuring me this issue has been resolved, the charge keeps appearing on my bills.

I am offered goodwill credits of £12 when I have been overcharged £17.99 a month. I’ve genuinely been shocked at just how many different agents have promised to resolve this for me, but nothing ever happens.

After one five-hour – yes five-hour – chat, I was cut off.

I have had enough.

LP, Kidderminster

What a sorry tale and an incredible waste of everyone’s time – not least yours, and including that of Virgin Media’s staff. Spending five hours on a chat must be some kind of record, especially given the matter was still not resolved.

Happily, Virgin Media has, after Guardian Money’s intervention, finally got its act together and sorted out what had happened.

It has established the Netflix subscription was added to your account by an agent in error – probably by mistyping an account number. It has confirmed that the item will not appear on your bill again, repaid the £144 it had overcharged you, and offered an additional £222 to say sorry.

You are just delighted you won’t have to contact it again.

The upward revision to Q1 GDP growth from 0.6% quarter-on-quarter to 0.7% q/q this morning (see opening post) suggests whoever is Prime Minister this time next week may benefit from the economic recovery being a bit stronger than expected.

So says Paul Dales, chief UK economist at Capital Economics.

He told clients that the economy may grow faster than expected this year – a boost to the winner of next Thursday’s general election.

The larger rise in GDP in Q1 was mainly due to upward revisions to consumer spending (from +0.2% q/q to +0.4% q/q) and the contribution from net trade (from +0.4ppts to +0.6ppts) more than offsetting downward revisions to government spending (from +0.3% q/q to 0.0% q/q) and residential investment (from +4.1% q/q to +3.2% q/q). The revision suggests that real GDP growth in 2024 as a whole may be more likely to come in a bit above our existing forecast of 1.0%.

Dales adds:

It now looks as though real household disposable income will grow by more than our forecast of 2.0% this year and we are expecting a solid 3.5% gain next year too. This underpins our forecast that consumer spending will be the main driver of a rise in GDP of at least 1.0% this year and about 1.5% next year. Should the saving rate fall back from its unusually high level, the economic recovery could be even stronger. This is certainly good news for whoever will be the Prime Minister this time next week, although it could also contribute to the Bank of England cutting interest rates a bit slower than otherwise.","So says Paul Dales, chief UK economist at Capital Economics.

Gross domestic product (GDP) rose by 0.7% in the first three months of 2024, revised upwards by the Office for National Statistics from a first estimate of 0.6%.

The first-quarter figures were lifted by growth in the services sector, up by 0.8%, as well as the production sector, which expanded by 0.6%, although that was revised down from 0.8% in the initial estimate. Other areas of the economy fared less well, with bad weather hampering the construction sector, where output fell by 0.6%.

The data confirmed that the UK was the fastest-growing economy in the G7 during the first quarter after a short recession in the second half of last year.

Real household disposable income – how much each home is left with after tax, adjusted for inflation – is estimated to have increased by 0.7% in the first quarter of this year, matching the growth in the final quarter of 2023, according to the ONS.

The strength of the economy has been a big issue in the general election campaign after voters suffered a squeeze from higher inflation and increased mortgage rates over the past three years.

Rishi Sunak has insisted that the UK economy has turned a corner but the latest encouraging data comes less than a week before polling day.

The Resolution Foundation thinktank said living standards – as measured by real household disposable income per head – were up by 2.4% as a result of pay rising faster than prices.

Despite the improvement as cost of living pressures have eased, living standards over the 2019-24 parliament as a whole fell by 0.6%, leaving the average person £120 a year worse off than they were at the time of the last election.

Adam Corlett, the thinktank’s principal economist, said it was only the third time since the first world war that living standards had been lower at the end of a parliament than at the start.

The UK economy showed no growth in April, with an increase in the services sector offset by falls in production and construction after heavy rain hampered building work and deterred shoppers from spending on the high street.

However, more recent figures show consumer confidence is returning – bolstered by falling inflation and stronger retail sales. UK inflation fell to 2% in May returning to the official target rate for the first time in nearly three years. Figures released last week showed retail sales bounced back with 2.9% growth in May after a weather-affected drop of 1.8% the previous month.

Economists said the improving economy was likely to benefit the incoming prime minister, with the Bank of England widely expected to cut interest rates later this year.

“It now looks as though real household disposable income will grow by more than our forecast of 2.0% this year and we are expecting a solid 3.5% gain next year too,” said Paul Dales, the chief UK economist at the research company Capital Economics.

“This is certainly good news for whoever will be the prime minister this time next week, although it could also contribute to the Bank of England cutting interest rates a bit slower than otherwise.”

Dales said the household savings ratio – the proportion of disposable income saved rather than spent – stood at 11.1% in the first quarter, its highest level since the second quarter of 2021.

Households tend to save more when they feel uncertain about the future, and the savings ratio rose during the cost of living crisis. Dales said that should the savings ratio come down from its “unusually high level” growth could be stronger than the 1% and 1.5% he was expecting for 2024 and 2025 respectively.","The UK economy grew at a faster rate than previously thought in the first quarter of 2024, handing the next prime minister an improved economic backdrop.

Unless the polls are wildly inaccurate, the Conservative party is heading towards a catastrophic defeat in the coming election.

All across the rich world, voters are angry at their governments – they blame politicians for a burst of inflation that happened almost everywhere and is now subsiding almost everywhere, including in the UK. But the Conservatives deserve defeat more than most: they took power 14 years ago promising to deliver responsible policies and economic success. Instead they have presided over economic stagnation and a collapse in public services.

Why has Conservative governance gone so badly? It is natural to blame Brexit, which did indeed increase trade frictions and therefore surely had a negative effect on British real income. However, Brexit has not had the disastrous effects some predicted, and has somewhat perversely led to a rise rather than a fall in immigration, especially of the highly skilled.

In fact, the roots of Britain’s poor economic performance are older and deeper than Brexit. Though many bad decisions undoubtedly contributed, one central cause was the way David Cameron and George Osborne gratuitously embraced fiscal austerity when they came to power after the global financial crisis.

At the time, this looked like an obvious macroeconomic error; more than a decade later, it has become a social and political catastrophe.

Let us recall the circumstances when the Conservatives took power. The financial crisis had produced a severe global recession; by 2010 the world economy was growing again, but all major economies, Britain included, were still operating far below capacity and had high unemployment.

Textbook economics tells us that when unemployment is high and inflation is low, governments should try to stimulate demand with reduced interest rates and fiscal deficits. Interest cuts were not an option because rates were already close to zero, so the indicated policy was fiscal stimulus.

Yet the Cameron government chose to do the opposite, pulling back fiscal support from an economy that still needed it badly. Britain was not the only nation turning to fiscal austerity in the face of high unemployment – Greece engaged in savage austerity, while Portugal, Spain, Italy and Ireland made large cuts, and fiscal policy in the US also turned contractionary.

What made the British case unique was that it was almost entirely an unforced error. Southern European austerity was a response to pressure from the bond markets: Greece was in effect cut off from private markets, while other nations faced sharply increased borrowing costs, becoming dependent on official lenders who insisted on budget cuts as a condition for loans. Bond buyers never lost faith in the US, but after 2010 Barack Obama faced a deeply hostile Congress, which in effect blackmailed him into spending cuts by threatening to provoke a government default.

While Britain had low borrowing costs like the US, its government was not divided. The Cameron executive could have chosen to maintain spending. Why did it turn to austerity?

Part of the answer is that policymakers were genuinely spooked by the sudden emergence of the crisis in Greece. Until Greece hit the wall, debt crises were generally thought of as a problem that happened only in poorer nations. It is understandable that many observers, at least initially, wondered if the Greek crisis was the leading edge of a broader attack by bond vigilantes.

But UK debt was clearly far smaller relative to the economy than Greece’s – and it became obvious early on that contagion from the Greek debt crisis was restricted to eurozone nations. So there was no reason to continue believing that the UK risked “becoming Greece”, as many politicians recklessly claimed at the time.

In fact, it soon became clear that even the eurozone crisis was more a matter of market panic than one of fundamentally unsustainable levels of debt. As the economist Paul De Grauwe has said, nations with debts in another country’s currency can suffer something similar to a bank run: panicked investors seeking to pull out their funds can cause a government to run out of cash, forcing it into default. Nations that borrow in their own currency are not vulnerable to such a self-fulfilling crisis, because they can in effect print money in a crunch.

This analysis was validated in 2012 when Mario Draghi, the president of the European Central Bank (ECB), said three words: “Whatever it takes.” This was taken to mean that the ECB would, if necessary, supply cash to governments facing a market panic. And suddenly the euro “debt” crisis faded away, with investors demanding much lower interest rates on the debt of Italy, Spain and so on.

Since Britain has not adopted the euro and had debts in its own currency, it was not vulnerable to this kind of cash crisis.

The bottom line is that there was no pressing economic need to slash spending in the face of high unemployment. I would argue that the best way to explain Britain’s austerity is not economic but sociological.

Sociology? I used to talk about the push for austerity being led by Very Serious People (a term I borrowed from the blogger Duncan Black). This was not really a joke: if you spend any time consorting with members of the global policy elite, you realise that many of them are driven primarily by the desire to appear “serious”. In economic terms, this usually means pushing policies that will cause significant hardship – to other people, of course.

The obsession with perceived seriousness reflects peer pressure, but in some ways also reflects personal careerism. Officials in democratic nations cannot expect to remain in office for more than a few years. What do they do next? If they have lobbied for “serious” policies, they can have a bright future giving speeches at Davos about the importance of making “tough choices”. Or they might even end up employed by the financial industry to lobby their former colleagues – where a reputation for “seriousness” is a prerequisite, no matter how much damage those policies have caused. (Indeed, Osborne has done both.)

Sociology partly explains the Conservative embrace of austerity. But there was also political calculation. Denunciations of debt and deficits often go hand in hand with demands for smaller government, in particular a shrunken welfare state. In effect, politicians whose real goal is to move policy to the right exploit fear of deficits to push an agenda that would be deeply unpopular if stated openly. The Oxford economist Simon Wren-Lewis calls this the “deficit deceit” hypothesis. The deceit aspect is especially obvious in the US, where Republican leaders routinely denounce deficits while pushing for budget-busting tax cuts. But there is every reason to believe that the same kind of cynicism played an important role in UK austerity.

It turns out, however, that exploiting debt fears to engineer cuts in public spending tends not to work out quite the way that small-government advocates hope.

What serious conservatives – they do exist – want is a less generous social safety net, with fewer income transfers to households, while governments concentrate on those functions that only government can perform. I do not share that desire, but never mind. What is important is that voters do not share that desire: cutting direct financial aid is deeply unpopular.

What does this have to do with deficit deceit? Even when a government manages to build support for spending cuts by scaring the public about debt and deficits, it generally finds itself shying away from spending cuts that will directly affect families’ incomes. Instead, it tries to save money by shortchanging public investment and public services, a strategy that seems preferable because the consequences of these spending cuts may not be all that visible in the short run.

But the effects of inadequate public investment cumulate over time, so that a fiscal strategy advertised as an exercise in responsibility ends up being deeply irresponsible, leading to crumbling infrastructure and deteriorating public services. This is how Cameron and Osborne’s error has compounded over the past decade.

Consider the NHS. I am clearly not an expert on the system, and I am sure that the NHS’s problems have multiple causes. But it is obvious to an outsider that direct public provision of healthcare, while it has major advantages, creates a special form of political vulnerability.

Compare the NHS with single-payer systems – including Medicare, which serves older Americans – in which the government pays the bills but does not employ the doctors or operate the hospitals. An attempt to save money by underfunding Medicare would provoke an immediate public outcry – in fact, false rumours of such a move created an outcry in 2010. But a government can underfund the NHS for years before the consequences become obvious to voters, and by that time the crisis can be very hard to fix.

To sum up: a decade ago, the main critique of austerity was macroeconomic – it was holding back recovery from the severe recession that followed the global financial crisis. And it did. But that was not the end of the story. Austerity also gradually undermined public services, including healthcare.

What will a Labour government do to reverse this damage? There are two reasons to worry it will fall short.

First, the era of Conservative austerity coincided with an era of low interest rates and substantial excess capacity, exactly the conditions under which Britain should have been investing in its future. The current environment is much less favourable.

Second, Labour’s stated plans lack any ambition to reverse austerity. In the US, the Biden administration came in with bold plans and managed to accomplish a significant fraction of them despite having only a razor-thin congressional majority. I am not hearing anything comparable from Labour, even though Keir Starmer seems on course to have political capital beyond the wildest dreams of US progressives.

I hope to be proved wrong. But right now it looks as though the shadow of austerity policies adopted in error 14 years ago will continue to darken Britain’s prospects for many years to come.","Though many bad decisions undoubtedly contributed, one central cause was the way David Cameron and George Osborne gratuitously embraced fiscal austerity when they came to power after the global financial crisis.

The Guardian,https://www.theguardian.com/politics/article/2024/jun/27/labour-europe-eu-brexit-jonathan-reynolds,2024-06-27,16:47:34 UTC,Labour to seek ‘stable position’ with Europe rather than reopen Brexit debate,"Labour would rather have stability in the UK’s relationship with Europe than try to seek accelerated economic growth by rejoining the EU’s single market or customs union, the shadow business secretary has said.

Addressing the British Chambers of Commerce (BCC) conference on Thursday, Jonathan Reynolds acknowledged that Brexit had been “very difficult for businesses” because it had erected trade barriers, but said reopening the debate would be worse.

With less than a week to go until polls open in the general election, Reynolds was trying to woo business leaders at the London event with a pitch that emphasised policy stability and encouraged businesses to invest.

Some business leaders and economists have said Labour’s hopes to grow the economy – and thereby pay for improved public services – could flounder without improved access to EU trade. But Reynolds argued that returning to the tumultuous debate over Brexit would be economically harmful because businesses would hold back investments further.

“You could not relive the argument and provide people with the assurance they need that we are moving to a period where British politics is going to be in a stable position rather than frankly causing you more difficulties,” he said.

“The practical, trade-based agreements that we put forward, rather than the constitutional arguments around customs unions or single markets, are a genuinely better way to do that.”

Kemi Badenoch, Reynolds’s Conservative counterpart, appeared later at the same event. She portrayed a Labour government as a threat to the sector and said her party believed in the “power of business to do good”.

However, the business secretary focused much of her appearance on “my favourite topic, of course, the divisive topic of identity politics”.

Badenoch compared Labour plans to monitor ethnic pay disparities to apartheid South Africa, saying she thought that the policy – an idea previously proposed by the Tory prime minister Theresa May – was “morally repellent” and claimed Labour wanted ethnicity to influence pay.

Labour’s manifesto does not say ethnicity should influence pay. The party has pledged to “enshrine in law the full right to equal pay for Black, Asian and other ethnic minority people” as well as make larger companies report the gap between pay for disabled and ethnic minority employees and the broader workforce. The Conservative party introduced similar gender pay gap reporting in 2017.

Shevaun Haviland, the BCC’s director general, told the conference that the political parties must stop “walking on eggshells” and try to improve the UK’s relationship with Europe, notably on aligning food and drink regulations, VAT and mutual recognition of professional qualifications. However, she added that Reynolds was right that “businesses don’t want a renegotiation”.

Amanda Blanc, the chief executive of the FTSE 100 insurer Aviva, told the conference that “an air of weariness and cynicism hangs over our economy” and that some of the “doom and gloom” was justified. However, she said she was optimistic that stable public policy after the election would allow businesses to invest in growing the economy.

Labour’s emollient message to business contrasts with 2019, when it lost the last election under the leadership of Jeremy Corbyn. Reynolds said the party’s relationship with business was “one of the most visible ways that Labour has changed since 2019”.

He was challenged at the conference by the owners of one business who said they were concerned about Labour’s pledge to give workers stronger rights, such as statutory sick pay and parental leave, from their first day of employment rather than after two years.

Fintan and Alison Galvin, a couple who serve as the chief executive and chief people officer of the Surrey-based software company Inv Group, said they were concerned that the changes would make it riskier for them to hire and train new workers.

“It seems very anti-business,” Alison Galvin said. “All of a sudden to have this potential curveball … You’ve got your probation period, but then after that what does that all look like?”

Fintan Galvin said: “To grow a business you’ve got to take risks. Anything that enhances a risk profile of employing a person is bad.”

Reynolds said he did not believe that Labour’s changes would affect the company’s recruitment practices, and he invited them to meet him to discuss their concerns.

During the election campaign Labour has also avoided making surprise policy announcements, mostly sticking with longstanding policy. Reynolds defended the party against accusations of running a boring campaign.

“I’m told by some commentators they don’t think Labour’s campaign is exciting enough,” he said. “Look, my friends, we’re not pitching you a new Netflix series, you know, we’re not putting on politics as entertainment.”","But Reynolds argued that returning to the tumultuous debate over Brexit would be economically harmful because businesses would hold back investments further.

Newsflash: The Bank of England has warned that financial markets remain at risk of a sharp correction.

In its latest financial stability report, the BoE says that high inflation, or geopolitical risks, could trigger a selloff.

The Bank says risks to the UK financial system are “broadly unchanged” since the first quarter of the year.

But some asset prices have continued to rise, it points out, while the risk of a sharp correction persists.

European markets are up around 8% so far this year, while the US Nasdaq Composite index has surged by 18%.

The report, which is designed to track the stability of the financial system, says:

The prices of many assets such as shares and bonds remain high relative to historical norms, and some have continued to rise. This suggests that investors in financial markets are continuing to expect the economy to recover and inflation to fall. They are placing less weight on risks, such as geopolitical developments or continued high inflation, that might cause weaker growth or interest rates to stay higher than expected. These risks make it more likely that there could be a sharp correction in asset prices that could ultimately make it more costly and difficult for UK households and businesses to borrow.

The Guardian,https://www.theguardian.com/business/article/2024/jun/27/global-elections-uk-economy-bank-of-england,2024-06-27,11:33:58 UTC,"Global wave of elections could hit UK financial system, warns Bank of England","Uncertainty caused by a global wave of elections, starting this weekend in France, risks destabilising the UK’s financial system, the Bank of England has warned.

Officials are concerned about the kind of policies that newly elected governments may enforce in large economies, including the US, where Donald Trump is vying for another term as president in the run-up to the election in November.

The French president Emmanuel Macron’s shock announcement of a parliamentary election, with a first round of voting on 30 June and Marine Le Pen’s far-right National Rally party forecast to make significant gains, had shown how political uncertainty could impact economic growth forecasts and cause volatility in financial markets, affecting government debt prices, the Bank’s financial policy committee (FPC) said.

But it is the sheer number of elections taking place this year that was cause for concern, with more than 80 countries – more than half the world’s population –heading to the polls this year. That includes the UK, where citizens will vote in a general election on 4 July.

“Policy uncertainty associated with upcoming elections globally has increased,” the Bank’s financial stability report said. Questions over a country’s political direction could amplify geopolitical risks, increase government borrowing costs, and lead to further global fragmentation, in a way that was “relevant to UK financial stability”, it said.

The FPC said it was still monitoring the impact high interest rates were having on households and businesses in the UK, with the Bank’s monetary policy committee having held rates at 5.25% this month for the seventh consecutive time.

That includes the 400,000 households whose monthly mortgage payments are expected to soar by 50% as they roll off fixed rates between now and the end of 2026.

In total, about 3 million – or 35% – of mortgageholders are still on fixed rates of below 3% and are due to see their payments jump over the next two years.

However, if headline interest rates drop from August onwards, as markets predict, another 2 million mortgageholders – including those on variable rates or coming off mortgages set at a higher level – could benefit, offsetting refinancing pressure for some households.

There are also concerns about the financial system’s exposures to the $8tn private-equity industry, which boomed during a period of low interests rates and has grown to play a significant role in financing UK businesses.

“Although the sector has been resilient so far, it is facing challenges in the higher rate environment,” the FPC said, noting this was becoming apparent as firms were forced to refinance their debt at much higher prices.

The FPC said it had also found “gaps” in the way UK banks were managing their exposure to the private-equity industry. The Bank of England and Financial Conduct Authority said they were working together to address a lack of transparency in overall borrowing levels, as well as the valuation of private-equity firms and their investments.

Policymakers said they would continue to test the resilience of the UK’s banking sector, revealing they would be testing the industry against the possibility of two separate and “severe” economic shocks.

The first – a “supply-shock scenario” echoing the ripple effects of Russia’s invasion of Ukraine – would cause inflation and interest rates to soar to 12% and 9%, respectively, as geopolitical tensions disrupt supply chains and cause the price of global commodities to soar.

The second “demand-shock scenario” – which has similarities to the impact of Covid-era lockdowns – assumes demand for global goods and services in decline, sending inflation and interest rates below 0.5% for a prolonged period of time.

In both cases, unemployment is projected to peak at 8.5% and the property industry would take a big hit, with commercial real estate prices declining by nearly 50%.

This year’s so-called desk-based stress tests are the second to be conducted without input from individual banks since they were launched a decade ago in response to the 2008 financial crisis.

The Guardian,https://www.theguardian.com/politics/article/2024/jun/26/uk-post-brexit-deal-bcc-eu,2024-06-26,21:30:20 UTC,"UK must stop ‘walking on eggshells’ over post-Brexit deal, says BCC chief","The UK’s current trade deal with the EU is not working and the country must stop “walking on eggshells” around the issue of building closer ties with its biggest trading partner, the director general of the British Chambers of Commerce (BCC) is expected to say.

At the annual BCC global conference in London on Thursday, Shevaun Haviland will say that the UK must forge closer ties with the EU and the next government should focus on improving trading relations to grow the economy.

“We must stop walking on eggshells and start saying it how it is,” Haviland will say.

“The current plan isn’t working for our members. But better trade terms are possible if the UK government and the EU reach agreement in areas of mutual benefit for business on both sides. A better deal is best for everyone.”

The intervention comes amid an election campaign where the two main political parties have largely stayed clear of the Brexit debate. Labour and the Conservatives have been criticised for their reluctance to discuss how successful Brexit has been and future policies towards the EU.

In an interview earlier this month, Keir Starmer had to deny that he was scared of talking about the issue, instead saying he was determined to build a “closer, better” relationship with the EU and improve Boris Johnson’s “botched deal”.

Businesses have criticised the additional red tape and increased costs that Brexit has heaped on to firms importing and exporting goods to and from the continent.

Importers of food and plants have been hit by charges associated with new Brexit border checks brought in at the end of April, with some logistics companies saying the changes have added up to 60% to transport costs.

Other businesses have complained that the increasing divergence on standards, such as those around construction products, has made it more expensive for UK companies to get their products certified for sale on the continent.

The comments from Haviland come as the BCC makes improving relations with the EU one of its key requests for the next government, saying the step would reduce costs for businesses.

The trade body is made up of 53 regional chambers of commerce affiliated to a central body and says it represents 50,000 businesses in the UK, which collectively employ six million people.

Its requests cover several specific policies, including securing a supplementary deal with the EU to remove the complexity of exporting food for small and medium-sized enterprises, and ensuring there are no new trade barriers created by linking the UK and EU emissions trading schemes.

It is also lobbying for a new deal that would allow UK companies to travel and work in Europe for longer.

The Labour party has said it will not return to the single market, the customs union or freedom of movement, but wants to deepen ties with Europe.

This includes negotiating a veterinary agreement to prevent border checks, help touring artists secure visas, while also promising to an agreement on professional qualifications to help open up markets for UK service exporters.

The Conservative manifesto says that the party would aim to build on the UK’s trade and cooperation agreement with the EU, but would not agree to anything that would “infringe the country’s sovereignty or involve submission to the court of justice of the European Union”.

It also said it wanted to further the benefits of Brexit by signing more trade deals, speeding up infrastructure developments, cutting red tape for business and creating new fishing opportunities.

Haviland will also use her speech to call for a long-term economic growth plan with a vision of up to 20 yearsand warn that action is needed to fix the UK’s growing skills shortages.","The UK’s current trade deal with the EU is not working and the country must stop “walking on eggshells” around the issue of building closer ties with its biggest trading partner, the director general of the British Chambers of Commerce (BCC) is expected to say.

Today’s report says: The eurozone has exited the recent manufacturing recession, putting it cyclically ahead of the U.S. Meanwhile, the labor market continues to slow although the unemployment rate remains near all-time lows. Southern Europe (Spain and Italy) continues to outperform Northern Europe (Germany) not only due to a prevalence of services, but also a rise in productivity in the case of Spain. Recent slower growth at the eurozone level reflects in part a faster passthrough of monetary policy, which has led to weaker inflation pressures. Share

3d ago 14.56 CEST S&P Global have raised their forecast for the UK economy this year. They now expect UK GDP to rise by 0.6% this year, up from a previous forecast of 0.3%. Chief economist Paul Gruenwald says “the recovery in services in the first quarter has been stronger than expected” in the UK. However, the UK growth forecast in 2025 has been trimmed to 1.2%, from 1.4%. Spain’s growth forecast has also been revised up, to 2.2% in 2024 from 1.8%. This is to reflect “robust household balance sheets and rapid disinflation”, Gruenwald explains. Share

3d ago 14.35 CEST S&P Global: soft-landing narrative remains valid The global economy remain on track for a soft landing, as central banks start to lower interest rates followin recent falls in inflation. So says credit rating agency S&P Global, in its latest global economic update. S&P Global is still optimistic that policymakers will pull off a ‘soft landing’ – bringing down inflation without triggering a recession. It explains: GDP growth has moderated in most economies (the U.S. remains an outlier) and recessions have been avoided. Demand pressures have come down, bringing inflation back toward target. Services demand and employment remain robust, moderating the speed of decline, and bolstering the probability of a soft landing. S&P Global argues that central banks have reached “the beginning of the end-game”, as some – such as the Bank of Canada, the Swiss National Bank and the European Central Bank – have recently started cutting interest rates in response to falling inflation. Although inflation has been stickier than hoped, S&P Global argues this is “just the flipside” of resilient spending and strong jobs markets, and compatible with a soft landing. They say: A recession with a sharp drop in employment and labor demand would likely produce a faster decline in inflation, but is that what we really want? Share

3d ago 14.32 CEST Dominic Chappell must repay £50m over BHS collapse Back in the UK retail sector, the former head of BHS is digesting a court ruling that he must pay at least £50m to cover losses racked up before its collapse. Yeterday, a judge found that Dominic Chappell had sought to “plunder” the UK department store chain, which collapsed in 2016. Mr Justice Leech said Chappell had agreed to purchase BHS without “any prospect” of obtaining working capital to meet its day-to-day financial needs. He then took the “opportunity to plunder the BHS Group as and when he could”, the judge explained. The Financial Times has more details: At a hearing on Tuesday, the judge said Chappell “should make the payments” set out in a draft order. A copy of the order, seen by the Financial Times, shows the sums include £21.5m for a wrongful trading claim, £17.5m for breach of fiduciary duty, plus costs and interest, totalling at least £50m.

Sales were reported to be below “average” for the time of year. Sales volumes are expected to remain below seasonal norms in July, albeit to a lesser extent. #DTS pic.twitter.com/RhJ7ohmOgj — CBI Economics (@CBI_Economics) June 26, 2024 The CBI explains: Sales were reported to be well below “average” for the time of year (-39% from +2% in May). Sales volumes are expected to remain below seasonal norms in July, albeit to a lesser extent (-29%).

Orders placed upon suppliers fell moderately in the year to June at a broadly similar pace to last month (-14% from -11% in May). Retailers expect the cutback in orders to continue next month (-16%). Alpesh Paleja, CBI interim deputy chief economist, says: “Last month’s nascent recovery in sales proved to be short-lived, with retailers reporting a faster-than-anticipated decline this month. Unseasonably cold weather in June may have played a role, but it’s notable that internet retail sales fell sharply in our survey, too. Consumer fundamentals are improving, with inflation now at the Bank of England’s 2% target and real incomes rising. But it’s clear that households are still struggling with the legacies of the cost-of-living crisis, with the level of prices still historically high in some areas. With consumer demand still on shaky ground, an incoming government can help business by ensuring that the UK is the most attractive place to start, grow and run a business. This will require bold action such as delivering a holistic cross-economy solution to the UK’s overly complex business rates system, which is a particular burden for retailers. This would help to alleviate the burden of higher costs.” Share

3d ago 11.34 CEST LGIM will also divest from TJX Legal & General Investment Management has also decided to divest its stake in US retail chain TJX, the parent company of UK chain TK Maxx. LGIM says TJX, like Glencore, failed to sufficiently address concerns raised in recent years about its environmental impact. LGIM says it concerned over TJX’s lack of a zero-deforestation policy and insufficient disclosure of “material Scope 3 emissions” that fail to account for its material value chains’ emissions. Today’s decisions will raise the number of divestments through LGIM’s Climate Impact Pledge to 16. LGIM says this “stewardship” of its investments is a critical lever in the global push to reach net zero. Stephen Beer, senior manager sustainability and responsible investment at Legal & General Investment Management, adds: We find that as time progresses, our conversations with companies can become harder-edged; not necessarily more difficult, but more focused. We use tools such as voting and divestment to encourage companies to meet our expectations on net-zero, while also sending a clear signal to the wider market. While divestment is one of the many stewardship tools we use as a mechanism for driving change, we see it as a last resort and by no means the last stage of engagement. Our engagement will continue, and where companies make sufficient progress, they will be reinstated. Ultimately, whilst we are focused on a net-zero objective, there is no one size fits all approach; our engagement approach is nuanced, it is about listening to companies and understanding the challenges they face, as well as the potential opportunities ahead, in accelerating the pace of the transition at a global scale.” Share","Share3d ago 14.56 CEST S&P Global have raised their forecast for the UK economy this year.

The Guardian,https://www.theguardian.com/business/article/2024/jun/26/universal-theme-park-bedfordshire-harry-potter-shrek-mario-kart,2024-06-26,13:29:33 UTC,Planned Universal theme park in Bedfordshire to ‘bring £50bn to UK economy’,"The movies group Universal has said a Hollywood theme park it plans to build in Bedfordshire, England, will be open 365 days a year and will boost the UK economy by nearly £50bn.

Universal Destinations & Experiences, which is owned by the US telecoms group Comcast, the parent company of Sky, plans to build on a 192-hectare site (476 acres) in Kempston Hardwick near Bedford. The company has an option to buy a further 25 hectares.

The theme park is expected to attract millions of visitors a year and would include a 500-room hotel and a dining area open to those without a theme park ticket.

The park’s experiences would include rides, shows and areas “based on the most popular films, video games and stories that people have enjoyed for decades”. Universal’s existing theme parks around the world feature Nintendo, Harry Potter and Shrek.

Construction is forecast to create 20,000 jobs and once open create 8,000 jobs initially, with more jobs likely over time, according to Universal. The company has pledged to pay the living wage to employees.

An analysis by Universal, produced in line with Treasury guidelines on economic appraisal, estimates the resort would bring in nearly £50bn of economic benefits to the UK.

The net economic contribution is forecast to be £35.1bn during construction and the first 20 years of operation. It would generate up to £14.1bn in additional tax returns over the same period, the study said.

Universal is still conducting due diligence and expects to decide on the project by the end of the year.

The new park, which would take five to six years to build, would be constructed on the site of Kempston Hardwick brickworks, once the world’s largest brickworks, which shut in 2008 and was demolished in September 2021.

The company said 92% of 6,000 people surveyed during a four-week public engagement period in May supported the theme park. It said it had “been delighted by the enthusiasm and overwhelmingly positive responses provided throughout the public engagement period”.

Page Thompson, Universal’s president in charge of new ventures, said: “A world-class theme park and resort from Universal has the potential to generate billions in economic benefit for the UK, by creating thousands of high-quality jobs and attracting millions of new visitors to the country.”

He told Sky News: “We’ve spent the last decade looking all over Europe and the United Kingdom for locations, and we think this is the best location we’ve ever seen.”

At the moment, Universal has five theme parks around the world: US parks in Hollywood, California, and at Orlando in Florida; as well as sites in Japan, China and Singapore.

Disneyland Paris, together with the associated Walt Disney Studios Park, is Europe’s biggest theme park, and attracts nearly 15 million visitors a year.","The movies group Universal has said a Hollywood theme park it plans to build in Bedfordshire, England, will be open 365 days a year and will boost the UK economy by nearly £50bn.

The Guardian,https://www.theguardian.com/environment/article/2024/jun/26/air-freight-greenhouse-gas-emissions-increase-post-pandemic-economy,2024-06-26,12:00:16 UTC,"Air freight greenhouse gas emissions up 25% since 2019, analysis finds","Air freight operators have increased their greenhouse gas emissions by 25% compared with 2019, analysis has found.

In 2023, air freight operators ran about 300,000 more flights than in 2019, an increase in flight volume of almost 30%. The US accounted for more than 40% of global air freight emissions, according to the report by campaign group Stand.earth.

Dr Devyani Singh, one of the authors of the analysis, described the expansion as “a new climate and human health threat” and urged air freight companies to “end their reliance on air cargo and shift freight shipments to lower-carbon modes of transport such as marine shipping or rail”.

Air freight produces an estimated 80 times more carbon than shipping by sea or truck, making it one of the most carbon-intensive transportation methods.

The researchers attribute the sharp increase to shifts in the post-pandemic economy and newfound consumer expectations in e-commerce, where rapid shipping has become the standard; Amazon’s Prime membership programme is used by more than 200 million people globally.

The researchers said that before the Covid-19 pandemic, air freight was reserved mostly for perishable goods, time-sensitive deliveries and luxury items. However, disruptions in the pandemic-era supply chain led to an unprecedented rise in the number of non-perishable and lower-value goods transported by air freight.

The report highlights a twofold reason for increased emissions. Before the pandemic, cargo was often transported in the belly of passenger planes. The dip in consumer demand for international air travel during the pandemic led to an expansion of cargo-only fleets to transport wares. This has not subsequently fallen, even as belly cargo emissions have returned post-pandemic.

By 2023, air freight emissions had increased by 25% from 2019, making up 93.8m tonnes overall. Meanwhile, belly cargo emissions have bounced back to almost 90% of 2019 levels.

FedEx and UPS were responsible for 24.7% of the industry’s carbon emissions in 2023. It is estimated that 99.8% of aviation fuel is produced from fossil fuels, with the scaling of low carbon replacements a distant prospect.

The Guardian,https://www.theguardian.com/business/article/2024/jun/26/it-doesnt-make-sense-why-us-tariffs-on-chinese-cleantech-risk-the-green-transition,2024-06-26,04:00:06 UTC,It doesn’t make sense: why US tariffs on Chinese cleantech risk the green transition | Jeffrey Frankel,"With historic heatwaves sweeping across the US and other parts of the northern hemisphere, June is expected to be the 13th consecutive month of record-breaking global temperatures. The primary cause, of course, is the enormous amount of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere. Despite the existential threat posed by rising atmospheric concentrations of greenhouse gases, emissions continue to increase at a faster pace than previously anticipated.

On one front, however, progress in the fight against the climate crisis has exceeded expectations. Amid the global shift from internal combustion engines to electric vehicles and the accelerated adoption of solar and wind power, demand for renewable energy is rapidly rising in the US and the EU.

This increased demand has been fuelled by significant declines in the real prices of solar panels, wind turbines, batteries, and EVs. In the US, this can be attributed in part to the clean-energy subsidies included in President Joe Biden’s Inflation Reduction Act and, more significantly, to low-cost Chinese imports.

Alarmingly, new tariffs imposed by the US and the EU on imports of solar panels, EVs, and other equipment, threaten to derail this progress. While estimating the cost of the clean energy transition is a difficult task, even conceptually, the global electricity sector alone is projected to require $3.5tn in capital investment annually between 2021 and 2050. Western countries have demanded that China pay its fair share of these costs, but their own trade policies are starkly at odds with their objectives.

Although the disproportionate targeting of cleantech imports from China dates back more than a decade, the trend accelerated significantly under former US president Donald Trump and has continued under Biden. In May, the Biden administration imposed a 100% tariff on Chinese EVs, along with new levies on a range of other Chinese goods, including solar cells and lithium-ion batteries.

These measures aim to protect American workers and critical domestic industries. But they risk undermining the administration’s climate agenda, particularly its efforts to raise the share of renewables to 100% of US electricity by 2035 and the share of EVs to 50% of new car sales by 2030.

The new US tariffs could extend beyond China’s national borders. In response to western tariffs, some Chinese manufacturers have moved to south-east Asia in recent years. Earlier this month, the US International Trade Commission decided to investigate claims by American solar-cell companies seeking to impose countervailing and anti-dumping duties on south-east Asian manufacturers. This decision comes despite opposition from US solar-power developers who rely on imported equipment for domestic production.

Meanwhile, the European Commission has imposed provisional tariffs on Chinese EVs after an eight-month investigation found that China’s “unfair subsidisation” of its EV industry undercuts EU competitors. The new EU tariffs, while not prohibitive, average 31%, which is substantially higher than the duties on conventional car imports from other trading partners.

To be sure, while historically low labour costs and economies of scale have helped reduce the price of Chinese solar panels and EVs, generous government subsidies – often in the form of cheap credit – have also played a significant role. But it remains unclear how blocking these low-cost imports, as many western politicians propose, would benefit workers and consumers in the US and the EU. Do American and European policymakers prefer that their own taxpayers, instead of Chinese citizens, bear the costs of clean-energy subsidies? Recall that western countries wanted China to pay its fair share of the energy transition.

Admittedly, promoting climate policies by emphasising their potential to create green jobs for domestic workers could be an effective political strategy. But we should recognise that these arguments are political, not economic.

Although US tariffs may help create jobs in the solar-panel industry, those would be offset by job losses in the solar-energy installation sector, which relies on low-cost equipment. Similarly, some EV production jobs would disappear if tariffs led to higher prices for battery imports. Meanwhile, many export jobs would be cut when China and other countries inevitably retaliate against western restrictions.

With US unemployment at 4%, policymakers and voters are now more concerned about inflation than jobs. Removing tariffs is the surest way for western governments to lower energy and transportation prices, thereby reducing inflation. This is yet another example of how international trade could lower the costs of the clean-energy transition – if we were to embrace it.

Jeffrey Frankel is a professor of capital formation and growth at Harvard University. He served as a member of President Bill Clinton’s Council of Economic Advisers.

© Project Syndicate","In the US, this can be attributed in part to the clean-energy subsidies included in President Joe Biden’s Inflation Reduction Act and, more significantly, to low-cost Chinese imports.
In May, the Biden administration imposed a 100% tariff on Chinese EVs, along with new levies on a range of other Chinese goods, including solar cells and lithium-ion batteries.
In response to western tariffs, some Chinese manufacturers have moved to south-east Asia in recent years.
Meanwhile, the European Commission has imposed provisional tariffs on Chinese EVs after an eight-month investigation found that China’s “unfair subsidisation” of its EV industry undercuts EU competitors.
The new EU tariffs, while not prohibitive, average 31%, which is substantially higher than the duties on conventional car imports from other trading partners.","['tariffs', 'chinese', 'jeffrey', 'green', 'share', 'eu', 'doesnt', 'solar', 'jobs', 'transition', 'frankel', 'western', 'sense', 'evs', 'risk', 'energy', 'imports', 'cleantech']",https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/a5f4dab354e4721f108f6b717f690f8eaa2bb688/0_146_5472_3283/master/5472.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctb3BpbmlvbnMucG5n&enable=upscale&s=a012d3fc27fee944b54646c1375f190d,True,,histor heatwav sweep across us part northern hemispher june expect th consecut month recordbreak global temperatur primari caus cours enorm amount greenhous gase atmospher despit existenti threat pose rise atmospher concentr greenhous gase emiss continu increas faster pace previous anticip one front howev progress fight climat crisi exceed expect amid global shift intern combust engin electr vehicl acceler adopt solar wind power demand renew energi rapid rise us eu increas demand fuell signific declin real price solar panel wind turbin batteri ev us attribut part cleanenergi subsidi includ presid joe biden 's inflat reduct act and signific lowcost chines import alarm new tariff impos us eu import solar panel ev equip threaten derail progress estim cost clean energi transit difficult task even conceptu global electr sector alon project requir tn capit invest annual western countri demand china pay fair share cost trade polici stark odd object although disproportion target cleantech import china date back decad trend acceler signific former us presid donald trump continu biden may biden administr impos tariff chines ev along new levi rang chines good includ solar cell lithiumion batteri measur aim protect american worker critic domest industri risk undermin administr 's climat agenda particular effort rais share renew us electr share ev new car sale new us tariff could extend beyond china 's nation border respons western tariff chines manufactur move southeast asia recent year earlier month us intern trade commiss decid investig claim american solarcel compani seek impos countervail antidump duti southeast asian manufactur decis come despit opposit us solarpow develop reli import equip domest product meanwhil european commiss impos provision tariff chines ev eightmonth investig found china 's `` unfair subsidis '' ev industri undercut eu competitor new eu tariff prohibit averag substanti higher duti convent car import trade partner sure histor low labour cost economi scale help reduc price chines solar panel ev generous govern subsidi - often form cheap credit - also play signific role remain unclear block lowcost import mani western politician propos would benefit worker consum us eu american european policymak prefer taxpay instead chines citizen bear cost cleanenergi subsidi recal western countri want china pay fair share energi transit admit promot climat polici emphasis potenti creat green job domest worker could effect polit strategi recognis argument polit econom skip past newslett promot sign first thing free daili newslett us morn brief break key stori day tell what 's happen matter enter email address sign privaci notic newslett may contain info chariti onlin ad content fund outsid parti inform see newslett may contain info chariti onlin ad content fund outsid parti inform see privaci polici use googl recaptcha protect websit googl privaci polici term servic appli newslett promot although us tariff may help creat job solarpanel industri would offset job loss solarenergi instal sector reli lowcost equip similar ev product job would disappear tariff led higher price batteri import meanwhil mani export job would cut china countri inevit retali western restrict us unemploy policymak voter concern inflat job remov tariff surest way western govern lower energi transport price therebi reduc inflat yet anoth exampl intern trade could lower cost cleanenergi transit - embrac it jeffrey frankel professor capit format growth harvard univers serv member presid bill clinton 's council econom advis ( c ) project syndic

4d ago 21.12 CEST A summary of today's developments Four men were arrested on Tuesday on suspicion of aggravated trespass at the prime minister’s constituency home in Yorkshire, police said. The suspects were arrested in the grounds of Rishi Sunak’s home in Kirby Sigston, near Northallerton, at around 12:40pm before being escorted off the property, North Yorkshire Police said. The force said the men included a 52-year-old from London, a 43-year-old from Bolton, a 21-year-old from Manchester, and a 20-year-old from Chichester. They remain in police custody and inquiries are ongoing.

The Labour party said it is suspending one of its candidates, Kevin Craig, because he is being investigated by the Gambling Commission. Craig is the party’s candidate in Central Suffolk and North Ipswich. It is understood that Craig is being investigated for betting against himself. He said: “I am deeply sorry to the many dedicated and loyal local Labour party volunteers who have been supporting my campaign. I will comply fully with the investigation.”

The news broke after a day of other developments in the election betting scandal. This morning, after prevaricating for days, the Conservative party said it was suspending two of its candidates who are being investigated over suspect bets placed on the timing of the election. And this afternoon the Metropolitan police said five more of its officers are being investigated by the commission, also over suspect election date bets. The allegation is that bets were placed by people who had access to inside information about Rishi Sunak opting for July. One of the Tory candidates, Craig Williams, has issued a statement saying that, although he made an error of judgment, he did not commit an offence.

Russell George, a Conservative member of the Senedd, has stepped back from the Welsh shadow cabinet as he faces an investigation by the gambling watchdog over alleged bets on the timing of the General Election. George represents Montgomeryshire in the Welsh parliament – the same area that Craig Williams, the Tory candidate who has had party support withdrawn as he faces similar allegations, represented at Westminster.

Keir Starmer has vowed to make tackling knife crime a “moral mission” at an emotional meeting with victims’ families and the actor Idris Elba.

Victoria Atkins, the health secretary, accused Labour of planning “to eradicate women from our national language” as the Conservatives sought to ramp up attacks on Keir Starmer around gender identity issues.

The equalities minister Kemi Badenoch said she “will not shut up” after David Tennant suggested she should at the British LGBT Awards. Badenoch accused the ex-Doctor Who actor of being a “rich, lefty, white male celebrity so blinded by ideology” in a post on X. Tennant, who won Celebrity Ally at a ceremony on Friday, received cheers and applause when he said of the Conservative Cabinet minister: “I don’t wish ill of her, I just wish her to shut up.” Badenoch said in response: “I will not shut up. I will not be silenced by men who prioritise applause from Stonewall over the safety of women and girls.” Share

4d ago 20.59 CEST Russell George, a Conservative member of the Senedd, has stepped back from the Welsh shadow cabinet as he faces an investigation by the gambling watchdog over alleged bets on the timing of the General Election. George represents Montgomeryshire in the Welsh parliament – the same area that Craig Williams, the Tory candidate who has had party support withdrawn as he faces similar allegations, represented at Westminster. Welsh Conservative leader Andrew RT Davies said: “Russell George has informed me that he has received a letter from the Gambling Commission regarding bets on the timing of the General Election. “Russell George has stepped back from the Welsh Conservative shadow cabinet while these investigations are ongoing. “All other members of the Welsh Conservative Group have confirmed that they have not placed any bets. “I will not issue further comment on this ongoing process, recognising the Gambling Commission’s instruction for confidentiality to protect the integrity of the process.” George said he would “co-operate fully” with the inquiry. In a statement, he said it was “the Gambling Commission, not the media” that has the responsibility and powers to properly probe the matter, and that he would not be commenting further.

4d ago 20.56 CEST The former Tory culture secretary Nadine Dorries said there is a “rottenness at the core of the Conservative Party” which has been allowed to develop over several years. Dorries told LBC: “The rebuilding of the Conservative Party, which I know many people in the Conservative Party are talking about now, it has to start from the roots up. “Because there is a rottenness at the core of the Conservative Party which has been allowed to develop over the past number of years, the past six, seven, eight years.” Share

4d ago 20.54 CEST Nadeem Badshah Four men were arrested on Tuesday on suspicion of aggravated trespass at the prime minister’s constituency home in Yorkshire, police said. The suspects were arrested in the grounds of Rishi Sunak’s home in Kirby Sigston, near Northallerton, at around 12:40pm before being escorted off the property, North Yorkshire Police said. The force said the men included a 52-year-old from London, a 43-year-old from Bolton, a 21-year-old from Manchester, and a 20-year-old from Chichester. They remain in police custody and inquiries are ongoing. In a statement, North Yorkshire Police said:“We have arrested four people in the grounds of the Prime Minister’s constituency home this afternoon. “Our officers were with the four men within one minute of them entering the grounds. “They were detained at around 12.40pm before being escorted off the property and arrested on suspicion of aggravated trespass. “The men aged 52 from London, 43 from Bolton, 21 from Manchester, and 20 from Chichester, remain in police custody for questioning and enquiries are ongoing.” In a separate incident, a car crashed into the gates of Sunak’s official country residence Chequers in Buckinghamshire, police said.



The incident took place shortly after midday on Tuesday when a white Volkswagen Scirocco hit the barriers at the entrance. Sunak was not at the manor house at the time and was attending events linked to the Japanese state visit in London.



Thames Valley Police said the driver, who was a 44-year-old man from the county, was arrested on suspicion of criminal damage and drink driving, and was the only person in the car.



A spokesperson added the driver “suffered serious injuries” and was taken to hospital, “where he remains”.



“While we are still in the very early stages of our investigation, there is currently no evidence to suggest there was any intention to harm anyone,” the force added. Share Updated at 21.11 CEST

This is an early example of what life will be like if they win. “Keir Starmer stood by while Rosie Duffield was hounded. He and his supporters will do the same with the country. “Do not let the bigots and bullies win.” Tennant is “one of the LGBTQ+ community’s most fierce allies and supporters”, according to the British LGBT Awards, and “often does red-carpet interviews while wearing pins associated with the community.

4d ago 19.10 CEST Early evening summary The Labour party has announced that it is suspending one of its candidates, Kevin Craig, because he is being investigated by the Gambling Commission. Craig is the party’s candidate in Central Suffolk and North Ipswich, which used to be a safe Tory seat but which Labour was projected to win, according to some, but not all, MRP polls published recently. It is understood that Craig is being investigated for betting against himself. The news broke after a day of other developments in the election betting scandal. This morning, after prevaricating for days, the Conservative party said it was suspending two of its candidates who are being investigated over suspect bets placed on the timing of the election. And this afternoon the Metropolitan police said five more of its officers are being investigated by the commission, also over suspect election date bets. The allegation is that bets were placed by people who had access to inside information about Rishi Sunak opting for July. One of the Tory candidates, Craig Williams, has issued a statement saying that, although he made an error of judgment, he did not commit an offence. (See 4.15pm.) UPDATE: Kevin Craig has just issued a full statement. He says: Throughout my life I have enjoyed the odd bet for fun whether on politics or horses. A few weeks ago when I thought I would never win this seat I put a bet on the Tories to win here with the intention of giving any winnings to local charities. While I did not place this bet with any prior knowledge of the outcome, this was a huge mistake, for which I apologise unreservedly. I have so much respect for how Keir Starmer has changed the Labour party and I have been fighting so hard to win this seat and change the country alongside him. However, it is right that the party upholds the highest standards for its parliamentary candidates – just as the public expects the highest standards from any party hoping to serve in government. I deeply regret what I have done and will take the consequences of this stupid error of judgment on the chin. I am deeply sorry to the many dedicated and loyal local Labour party volunteers who have been supporting my campaign. I will comply fully with the investigation. Keir Starmer has vowed to make tackling knife crime a “moral mission” at an emotional meeting with victims’ families and the actor Idris Elba.

4d ago 19.09 CEST Steve Baker, the Northern Ireland minister, has become the latest Tory to say that he would oppose Nigel Farage joining the party. In an interview with Times Radio, Baker said: I know some colleagues want to welcome [Farage] in but in the diverse country that we have today, and particularly in a diverse community like the one that I represent, one must understand how one will be heard when talking about sensitive issues and I’m afraid Nigel just doesn’t, just does not illustrate his capacity to do that. And so for that reason I would not want him within the Conservative party. Share

4d ago 18.47 CEST David Davis, the Tory former Brexit secretary, said it was stupid for colleagues to bet on the timing of the general election. In an interview with Radio 4’s PM programme, he said: Even if it’s not criminal, it’s spectacularly stupid … I would have felt betrayed by the people who work for me making any sort of bet of this sort. But Davis said he thought some sorts of political bet were acceptable. There are times when it’s appropriate enough to bet on things. I mean, I bet on the Brexit vote because I was so annoyed that people said we were going to lose when I thought we would win, but that wasn’t improper. . Share

The Guardian,https://www.theguardian.com/politics/article/2024/jun/25/a-better-way-to-measure-the-uks-health-and-happiness,2024-06-25,16:10:51 UTC,A better way to measure the UK’s health and happiness,"Your editorial rightly points out that GDP is not a good measure of how people are faring (19 June). As an alternative, you offer the UN’s human development index. But we already have a better British alternative – the measure of life satisfaction in the Office for National Statistics’ annual population survey.

The question asked is: “Overall, how satisfied are you with your life these days (0: not at all satisfied, 10: completely)?” The results are published every quarter. That is an excellent measure of the nation’s success. It provides a good account of how we are doing on average and of the degree of fundamental inequality in our society.

It should become the objective of government policy to maximise wellbeing, measured in this way. As Thomas Jefferson said: “The life and happiness of the people ... is the first and only legitimate object of good government.” And Keir Starmer has said that “with every pound spent on your behalf, we would expect the Treasury to weigh not just its effect on actual income but also its effect on wellbeing”. So let us hope that the new government will judge all its policy options by their effects (per pound spent) on the life satisfaction of the population.

The Guardian is correct to agree with the late Robert Kennedy, who said in 1968 that growth figures measured everything “except that which makes life worthwhile”. More than 50 years later, it is important to recognise that a thriving economy makes an important contribution to the UK’s collective wellbeing. But GDP remains a poor measure of social progress. It measures criminal activity, but not caring responsibilities, and takes no account of the impact on public health or the planet.

That is why the next government should ground its decision-making in a wide range of statistics that measure our collective wellbeing. Ministers need to complement GDP data with a broad basket of figures about the reality of our lives and our impact on the environment.

In 2023, Carnegie’s Life in the UK Index revealed yawning gaps in wellbeing between different groups in society. Only when similar datasets are used to underpin policymaking will governments have any hope of properly tackling the biggest problems of our time.

While it’s true that the public don’t necessarily understand what GDP means, many politicians and journalists don’t seem to know how GDP is calculated. As the economist Richard J Murphy has pointed out, “10% of GDP is made up”. When calculating GDP, the average cost of renting is used to figure out how much money owner-occupiers would be spending if they rented rather than owned their homes. This is called “imputed rents” and it accounts for around 10% of GDP.

But does it make sense to call rent a productive part of the economy? If all landlords raised their rents massively, this would appear on GDP as “growth”, when in reality, no new goods or services would have been produced. It’s the same with private equity – if a financial investor buys and then asset-strips a company, this will appear in GDP as “growth”. But again, nothing has been produced, and therefore highly unproductive economic exchanges can appear in the GDP statistics as “productive”.

Looking at GDP in isolation is in practice about as useful as relying on the position of celestial bodies to tell you about your love life.

4d ago 16.12 CEST US consumer confidence dips US consumer morale has dropped this month, a new survey shows, but was stronger than expected. The Conference Board’s consumer confidence index dipped in June to 100.4, down from 101.3 in May. Economists had expected it would fall more, to exactly 100. The decline was due to a deteriorating short-term outlook for income, business, and conditions in the jobs market. Dana M. Peterson, chief economist at The Conference Board, explains: “Confidence pulled back in June but remained within the same narrow range that’s held throughout the past two years, as strength in current labor market views continued to outweigh concerns about the future. However, if material weaknesses in the labor market appear, Confidence could weaken as the year progresses.” 📈😁Americans are feeling confident!

4d ago 15.22 CEST A summer of savings: Barclays and HSBC to cut fixed-rate mortgage deals Rupert Jones HSBC and Barclays are cutting rates on their fixed mortgage deals in what some brokers claim could be the start of a “summer of savings” for homebuyers and those looking to remortgage. Barclays has reduced rates by more than 0.25 percentage points in some cases from Tuesday, and its cuts led to a quick response from HSBC, which said it would be cutting rates across its home loans range with effect from Wednesday. While new home loan rates have been broadly stable over the last month or two, the pricing of some deals has crept up. However, recent improvements to money market swap rates – which largely determine the pricing of new fixed deals – appear to have prompted two of the biggest mortgage lenders to reduce their rates, with others predicted to follow suit.

4d ago 15.03 CEST Over in Canada, inflation has jumped unexpectedly. Consumer prices across the Canadian economy rose by 2.9% in the year to May, up from 2.7% in April, dashing hopes of a small fall.

Faster price growth for services was led by cellular services, travel tours, rent and air transportation. Prices for goods (+1.0%) grew at the same rate as in April. Not a surprise in the least. Canada’s inflation rate is largely driven by enternal factors outside of the control of Canada.

4d ago 14.44 CEST Amnesty: Shein’s floatation would be a ‘badge of shame’ for London Stock Exchange Human rights organisation Amnesty International has hit out at plans for China’s fast fashion group Shein to float on the London Stock Exchange.

Shein wins Labour support as it prepares £50bn London listing Read more But Dominique Muller, Amnesty International researcher specialising in the garment industry, says the City should demand transparent and binding safeguards regarding human rights standards, before admitting Shein to the fold: ​“It’s deeply troubling that a company with questionable labour and human rights standards and an unsustainable fast fashion business model could be set to reap hundreds of millions of pounds via a sale of shares and a listing on the London Stock Exchange. “Where SHEIN goes, others will try to follow. The UK authorities and the London Stock Exchange should not facilitate SHEIN’s listing until transparent and binding safeguards regarding internationally accepted human rights standards covering its entire supply chain are agreed and applied, and any abuses identified fully remedied. “Rewarding SHEIN’s current methods via a flotation would be a badge of shame for the London Stock Exchange, the bankers helping bring it to market, and any investors set to profit from it. It would be an appalling example of a process which delivers for the rich by squeezing the poor. It validates the view that it is acceptable to regard workers and their rights, company products and the environment as expendable – which cheapens us all. “It is essential the new UK government does not allow a race to the bottom in terms of corporate and human rights standards. It should require companies to prevent serious environmental harms and human rights abuses occurring throughout their entire operations and supply chains. It should enable workers whose rights are abused by company activities anywhere in the world recourse to justice through UK courts.” Shein has been accused of using forced labour to make its affordable clothing, such as t-shirts and sweaters. ‘Worst of the worst’: why is fast fashion retailer Shein launching a reality show?

4d ago 14.25 CEST Fed Governor Bowman open to raising rates if inflation doesn’t improve A US central bank policymaker has indicated she would be open to raising interest rates if inflation not fall as hoped. In a speech in London today, Federal Reserve governor Michelle Bowman also said the time is not right yet to start lowering borrowing costs. Bowman explained: Should the incoming data indicate that inflation is moving sustainably toward our 2% goal, it will eventually become appropriate to gradually lower the federal funds rate to prevent monetary policy from becoming overly restrictive. However, we are still not yet at the point where it is appropriate to lower the policy rate. In my view, we should consider a range of possible scenarios that could unfold when considering how the FOMC’s monetary policy decisions may evolve. I remain willing to raise the target range for the federal funds rate at a future meeting should progress on inflation stall or even reverse. Latest comments from Fed's Bowman, though at the more hawkish end of the spectrum, suggest chances of the US Fed cutting rates this year (notwithstanding the Nov Presidential Elections) rapidly receding.

The Guardian,https://www.theguardian.com/business/article/2024/jun/26/human-rights-group-fca-shein-lse-flotation-uyghurs,2024-06-26,16:11:48 UTC,Human rights group urges UK financial regulator to block Shein’s LSE flotation,"A human rights group has urged Britain’s financial regulator to block the Chinese fast-fashion retailer Shein’s planned blockbuster flotation on the London Stock Exchange.

Stop Uyghur Genocide, a UK-based human rights charity that alleges minority Uyghur people are being used as forced labour at some of Shein’s cotton suppliers in China’s north-western Xinjiang region, has begun a legal campaign against the planned stock market listing.

Represented by the law firm Leigh Day, the campaign group has written to the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) to argue that “any attempt by Shein to list on the LSE should be refused”.

The China-founded company, which was valued at $66bn (£52bn) in a fundraising round last year, began to explore a listing on the LSE early this year, and is expected to file a prospectus with the UK regulator soon. Shein abandoned its original plan to list in New York after opposition from US politicians.

On Tuesday, Amnesty International UK said Shein’s potential London listing would be a “badge of shame” for the London market because of the fast-fashion firm’s “questionable” labour and human rights standards.

The fast-fashion retailer said on Wednesday: “Shein has a zero-tolerance policy for forced labour and we are committed to respecting human rights. We take visibility across our entire supply chain seriously and we require our contract manufacturers to only source cotton from approved regions.”

Stop Uyghur Genocide said it had reminded the FCA that its US counterpart, the Securities and Exchange Commission, has already refused to recommend the listing of Shein for trading on the US stock exchange because of concerns around labour practices in the company’s supply chains.

The group said the London listing should not be allowed to go ahead because the UK has signed up to International Labour Organization conventions, which set out minimum standards for engaging workers. Any concerns about companies engaging workers in their supply chains that may breach those minimum standards are inconsistent with the UK’s convention obligations, it said.

“The FCA has a statutory duty of integrity and to protect its investors,” the group added.

The Leigh Day solicitor Ricardo Gama, who represents Stop Uyghur Genocide, said: “Stop Uyghur Genocide expects UK financial institutions to uphold the high ethical standards that they pay lip service to, and to make clear that London isn’t the place to come for a ‘no questions asked’ approach to capital. At the very minimum regulators must make sure that laws in place to root out modern slavery are complied with.”

Stop Uyghur Genocide said it was concerned about the London Stock Exchange’s ability to detect and respond to any alleged forced labour in Shein’s supply chains.

Stop Uyghur Genocide is preparing a detailed submission to the regulator to support its letter.

In the meantime, the campaign group’s lawyers have asked the FCA to obtain more information from Shein about the “accuracy of its published modern slavery statement”.



Under the Modern Slavery Act, large businesses have to publish a statement every year that sets out the measures they have taken to ensure slavery and trafficking do not occur in their own operations and their supply chains.

Leigh Day lawyers have urged the regulator to “refuse Shein’s listing application unless the FCA is satisfied that its products are not tainted by forced labour”.

Rahima Mahmut, executive director of Stop Uyghur Genocide, said she was “deeply concerned” about Shein’s potential London listing and said the organisation had been highlighting concerns from national security and human rights experts that Shein “could be associated with egregious human rights abuses, including modern slavery, and pose ethical and security risks to businesses and citizens”.

“Our investment community must not support companies like Shein who are reportedly linked to the Chinese state and which we believe may enable the ongoing genocidal policies against Uyghurs.”

The FCA declined to comment on Shein’s potential listing. It noted that it has no investigation or enforcement powers relating to alleged breaches of legislation not within its remit, such as the Modern Slavery Act or tax legislation.

Before a company’s shares can be admitted to the LSE, the firm must apply to the FCA for admission to listing and to approve its prospectus. The watchdog said it was the company’s responsibility to ensure the information in its prospectus is accurate, and not the FCA’s role to independently verify the accurate of information.

Michael Polak, barrister and chair of Lawyers for Uyghur Rights, said: “A firm alleged to have involvement in goods directly produced by slave labour in the Uyghur region creates a risk that those vital principles will be violated. We will ask the FCA to consider the expert evidence that we will provide to them before deciding on a public listing in the UK.”","A human rights group has urged Britain’s financial regulator to block the Chinese fast-fashion retailer Shein’s planned blockbuster flotation on the London Stock Exchange.
On Tuesday, Amnesty International UK said Shein’s potential London listing would be a “badge of shame” for the London market because of the fast-fashion firm’s “questionable” labour and human rights standards.
The fast-fashion retailer said on Wednesday: “Shein has a zero-tolerance policy for forced labour and we are committed to respecting human rights.
Stop Uyghur Genocide is preparing a detailed submission to the regulator to support its letter.

European commissioner Thierry Breton has announced that the EU will take action against Apple under its new digital regulations, the Digital Markets Act. Posting on X, Breton says: For too long Apple has been squeezing out innovative companies — denying consumers new opportunities & choices.

5d ago 15.52 CEST The Bloomberg debate wrapped up with quick statements from the two protagonists. Jonathan Reynolds goes first, saying businesses are facing too many serious challenges to risk another five years of a chaotic and unstable government. “It’s time to return to a government that solves problems, rather than causing then”, he says, pledging to keep working with businesses after the election. Kemi Badenoch says the difference between the two parties is that Labour want to bring in new laws that make it harder to hire staff, and to micro manage businesses. Conservatives believe in capitalism, she pledges, the power of business to do good. “We don’t think profit is a dirty word, and we are optimistic about our future,” Badenoch concludes. Share Updated at 16.21 CEST

5d ago 15.47 CEST Badenoch and Reynolds on leadership ambitions And finally… Q: Bloomberg turns to its guests’ leadership ambitions. Jonathan Reynolds gets the giggles, turning red, before insisting he is “very much focused” on becoming the secretary state for business and trade. Keir Starmer has done a “quite exceptional” job of turning Labour around, he adds. Kemi Badenoch (who has been cited as a potential leader if the Conservatives are hammered in next month’s election) says the question was obviously meant for her (getting Reynolds guffawing). Badenoch says she stood for the leadership before, and lost, and is now “terrified” at the prospect of Labour coming into power. She insisted there was “no better job” than Business and Trade Secretary, which “is a lot easier and a lot less pressured than being prime minister”. Q: Some cabinet ministers may lose their seats… would you be up for the leadership challenge if it came up? Badenoch says leadership issues will be discussed after the election, not before…. That doesn’t exactly rule out a Badenoch bid… and appears to leave the door open for one…. Share Updated at 16.22 CEST

5d ago 15.40 CEST Q: Should Thames Water be nationalised? Kemi Badenoch says Thames Water is a “very, very difficult” situation; she doesn’t want to move markets by discussing nationalisation while it is going through difficulties. Reminder: The Guardian reported in April that the government was considering radical plans to renationalise Thames Water, under which most of its £15.6bn debt would be added to the public purse. The palava with Thames Water shows that the UK’s regulatory system is not working well, as the company tries to make a profit, keep bills low, and invest in infrastructure. Jonathan Reynolds says people are unhappy about the state of the UK water industry. Reynolds hopes that nationalisation can be avoided, pointing out that investment must involve losing as well as gaining money. Share

5d ago 15.35 CEST Reynolds: Shein London listing would help regulate company Onto topical issues. Q: Have you met with Shein, and would you put any restrictions if they chose to list in the UK [a decision which is moving closer…]. Jonathan Reynolds says Labour have met with Shein. Many people who are considering economic activity in the UK have spoken to Labour in recent years, he explains. His view is that if companies are doing businesses in the UK, they should be regulated from the UK. So, a listing would be the way to enforce the “highest standards” on, for example, the labour market, regulatory compliance, or tax. Any listed company in the UK has a fairly significant set of compliance placed upon them. If you are keen to see businesses operating to the highest standards, you should want to see them do that from the UK. Kemi Badenoch, the current business and trade secretary, reveals she has NOT met with Shein. She has two concerns with a potential Shein listing in London. 1) The way Shein ships individually packaged orders directly from Chinese warehouses to consumers’ homes, meaning they fall below the £135 threshold for import duty “That could mean quite a lot lost in terms of taxes,” Badenoch says. 2) Concerns that Shein are using forced labor in Xinjiang. Share

5d ago 15.23 CEST Q: What’s your policy on money from the Middle East and China? Jonathan Reynolds says Labour is extremely keen to bring in overseas investment. The Gulf is an “obvious place to look for that” money, he says, while China brings different considerations in terms of national security. Labour will hold an investment summit in its first 100 days of power, he says, and ‘make the case’ for investing in Britain. ‘It won’t take as long as people think’: Rachel Reeves on being ‘scrappy’ – and changing Britain Read more Reynolds says many of Labour’s plans come from the “reasonable complaints” of businesses who said they considered investing in the UK, but were put off by the prime minister changing, or because they didn’t know the country’s plans post-2016 (the year of the Brexit vote). Kemi Badenoch says the UK already has the largest foreign domestic investment of an European country. Share Updated at 15.24 CEST

5d ago 15.18 CEST Q: What will you do to help small businesses get paid on time? Kemi Badenoch says it is “extraordinary” how larger corporations treat smaller firms in their supply chain. “We will look again” at more regulations to speed up payments, she pledges. Jonathan Reynolds says Labour would force the audit committees of large public companies to say how quickly they pay their suppliers – that would address the power inbalance that allows them to leave small firms waiting for money…. Share

5d ago 15.11 CEST Kemi Badenoch is then asked about why more trade deals haven’t been signed. Badenoch says the US government is not signing any free trade deals at the moment, so the UK has been signing agreements with individual US states instead. It has been “very difficult” negotiating with India, she adds; any deal with Delhi has to work for business. UK and India put free trade deal talks on ice until later this year Read more Share

5d ago 15.07 CEST Jonathan Reynolds says Labour will improve the UK’s relationship with the European Union – starting with it not being governed by the internal politics of the Conservative Party. He says Labour will seek to reduce checks on food and agricultural products, and to improve the mutual recognition of professional qualifications. Reynolds argues that ‘relitigating the arguments on the customs unions or the single markets would not provide the stability Britain needs. Q: The EU say they’re open to negotiating a deal to ease border friction for fresh food, for example, but it must have a role for the European Court of Justice. Will you accept that? Reynolds says Labour won’t give away its negotiating hand. But surely, if you don’t want lower food standards than the EU, you can remove some of the trade frictions and costs. Kemi Badenoch says the Conservative government tried to strike such a deal, but the EU wouldn’t accept it. She insists the UK can’t accept oversight by the ECJ. Share

5d ago 14.59 CEST Onto Brexit! Q: What is your top proposal to cut costs for businesses exporting to the EU? Kemi Badenoch claims that it’s hard to tell the impact of Brexit, versus the impact of the pandemic. But she insists that services exports have been “going gangbusters”, making the UK the 2nd largest services exporter, and the 4th largest exporter in the world. “Those are facts”. Well….. this thread from Sky News’s Ed Conway shows that the picture is not quite as rosy as that: First thing to say is that the bare bones of the claim are certainly true.

Between 2021 and 2022 the UK did indeed rise from 7th in the league table of the world's biggest exporters (counting both goods and services) to 4th.

We'll get to why this happened in a moment. But still pic.twitter.com/jaZfDbHbsx — Ed Conway (@EdConwaySky) June 23, 2024 However here's some (very) important context.

It's not like the UK has only JUST hit fourth spot. In fact, it was in 4th place in 2020. And in 2015, 2014 and 2013.

Actually if you look at the modal average of our position in the past decade it was... fourth. pic.twitter.com/mKOsTe2Qtu — Ed Conway (@EdConwaySky) June 23, 2024 So that ""leapfrogging"" notion is wrong.

If anything the outlier here was 2021, where we dropped to the lowest position we'd EVER been in, going back two decades or so.

Raising the question: what happened? Forget leapfrogging - why did we drop down?

Brexit? Covid? Something else? pic.twitter.com/V3VlkjFLGy — Ed Conway (@EdConwaySky) June 23, 2024 Having looked into this, I can tell you at least part of the answer comes back to gold.

If u follow me you've prob already heard this, but UK trade figs are MASSIVELY distorted by flows of gold into & out of London vaults.

Film I made about this years ago https://t.co/Vgd3ONcNZQ — Ed Conway (@EdConwaySky) June 23, 2024 And gold flows have been a very big distortionary factor in UK trade post 2019. Just LOOK at how much of the total UK export figure since then has been gold: a LOT.

Even tho we don't mine sizeable amounts of gold, it's routinely been one of our biggest ""exports"" in recent years pic.twitter.com/SVP6sWfngY — Ed Conway (@EdConwaySky) June 23, 2024 Now, nearly every trade statistician agrees you should exclude gold from trade stats. After all, this is more of a financial transaction than a traded good.

The @ONS already excludes gold from most of its figs. More on this here: https://t.co/Ihz5gH6rY0 — Ed Conway (@EdConwaySky) June 23, 2024 But those UNCTAD trade league tables don't, as far as I can tell, exclude gold.

And this is relevant. Because look: in 2021 UK gold exports dropped a LOT. In 2022 they bounced back to the highest level ever, boosting TOTAL UK exports by a whopping 4% (that's MASSIVE). pic.twitter.com/GAPDjsETGJ — Ed Conway (@EdConwaySky) June 23, 2024 Raising the question, what does our trade picture look like if you EXCLUDE gold.

Are we still in fourth place?

In short: no.

Look, ex gold, our ranking would have been 6th last year. Not 4th.

In fact we wouldn't have hit 6th since 2015. Which is consistent with other datapoints. pic.twitter.com/POeOJU04pf — Ed Conway (@EdConwaySky) June 23, 2024 Share

5d ago 14.53 CEST Reynolds: Need to escape low-growth, high-tax, poor-services doom loop Next issue – fiscal issues, and the IMF’s warning that both major parties’ manifestos are too opaque and lack detail on tax and spend. Q: They say voters will be voting in a knowledge vacuum…. Kemi Badenoch says she “completely disagrees” with IFS’s assessment. The truth is that people are not placing their votes based on the IFS’s analysis, but actually base it on what a party believes in, and what its values are. She says the mini-budget showed the problems of cutting tax without cutting spending. We are the party of sound money, of business, Badenoch promises. Jonathan Reynolds says he respects the IFS…. and agrees that the Conservatives record speaks for itself (!). Taxes are at a record high, and public services don’t reflect that tax burden. The key is to break out of this low-growth, high-tax, poor-services doom loop, Reynolds says – and that’s Labour’s plan. He says the UK would have billions of pounds more, if the economy had grown at the rate of the last Labour government. Q: Are you ready to fight interest groups which won’t like the planning changes you have in mind? Reynolds says that’s why Labour needs a mandate, so it can build the homes and infrastructure Britain needs. Kemi Badenoch disputes this claim, pointing out that Labour members of the House of Lords had blocked the government’s attempts to remove nutrient neutrality rules, and free up housebuilding. Share

5d ago 14.40 CEST Reynoldsd defends Labour's plans for workers rights Next, a question on Labour’s plans for more protection against unfair dismissal, and ending zero-hours contracts. Q: Is a Labour government going to make life much harder for small businesses? Jonathan Reynolds says Labour’s manifesto is “a pro-worker, pro-business” agenda, that – he says – has been developed closely with businesses. That includes a better business environment, changes to planning rules, certainty on tax, that will deliver more growth. Reynolds adds that “The floor will rise”, but insists the vast majority of businesses are already operating at a much higher level than this new, higher floor already. Kemi Badenoch hits back, saying it’s businesses don’t want these measures. She claims it’s “unbelievable” that Reynolds claims these new regulations have been developed with businesses. She insists: Businesss is terrified of what Labour is selling. Badenoch says Labour’s plans for employment rights from day one are unpopular, and that the CEOs of Asda, Currys [see here] and M&S have said these are “terrible regulations”. Reynolds returns fire, saying that the Conservative Party promised an employment bill after Brexit, and security in the workplace, and hasn’t delivered on it. Labour, he says, will create a better working environment, one where people have secure work they can build a family round. Badenoch won’t accept this, telling business leaders they should be “absolutely terrified” of “surrendering” your business, the economy, and tax, to Labour. Badenoch argues that Labour are “fishing in an empty barrel”, and that flexible working rights are not the cause of problems in the UK economy. Share Updated at 14.52 CEST

5d ago 14.25 CEST Jonathan Reynolds agrees that governments must change their plans when circumstances change… …and blames Liz Truss’s “disastrous mini-budget” for forcing Labour to drop its £28bn green investment plans. He then returns to his criticism of Rishi Sunak’s climate u-turn speech last September, in which the PM pushed back the deadline for selling new petrol and diesel cars and the phasing out of gas boilers. That was a “short-lived relaunch of the Rishi Sunak premiership”, Reynolds says, to pitch the PM as a change candidate.

The Guardian,https://www.theguardian.com/business/article/2024/jun/24/london-tunnels-ipo-amsterdam-uk-markets,2024-06-24,13:18:16 UTC,London Tunnels moves IPO plan to Amsterdam in blow to UK markets,"London Tunnels, which aims to convert an abandoned underground network into a tourist attraction, has ditched plans to float in the capital, instead opting to list in Amsterdam.

The company aims to make the Kingsway exchange tunnels, a network of 8,000 sq metres under Holborn in central London, into a new attraction that will bring in 2 million visitors a year.

The group revealed on Monday that it hoped to raise £30m by listing on Euronext Amsterdam, saying it could make the most of the size and scale of the equity and capital markets of Europe by listing in the Dutch capital.

The decision comes after the company sent papers to the London Stock Exchange (LSE) in January outlining its intention to float in the capital.

At the time, its chief executive, Angus Murray, said: “This unique set of tunnels, owned by a British company, built by the British government, for the defence of Britain, that can further enhance London’s reputation as a leading tourist destination, should be listed in London.”

The change of heart by the company is the latest blow to the LSE after a number of high-profile companies opted to list in Europe and the US ahead of London in recent months.

In May, the Paddy Power owner, Flutter, announced its decision to switch its primary listing to New York, while the UK chip designer Arm opted to list on Wall Street last August after the government failed to convince it to float in London.

However, this has been partly offset by big players such as the fashion retail company Shein and Raspberry Pi announcing plans to list on the LSE.

The Kingsway tunnels were built in the early 1940s to shelter up to 8,000 people during the blitz but were never used for this purpose.

Instead, the Special Operations Executive, responsible for organising espionage and sabotage operations in German-occupied Europe, moved in during the final two years of the war and is thought to be the inspiration for the Q branch in Ian Fleming’s James Bond novels.

The tunnels later housed the first secure transatlantic telephone cable, which ran a hotline that connected the White House and the Kremlin during the cold war, before ownership was transferred to British Telecom (BT) in 1981.

London Tunnels has agreed to buy the site from BT next year and intends to open the attraction in 2027, including exhibits celebrating the history of the tunnels, as well as reinstating the city’s deepest London bar, which closed in the 1980s.

However, the float prospectus lists a number of risk factors to the project, including the warning that plans could be delayed if it cannot get the full planning permission it needs.

Last month, it secured the planning green light from the City of London Corporation but is still awaiting planning signoff from the London borough of Camden.

The list also includes risks around whether the structural integrity of the tunnels is affected by their age, the possibility that the removal of asbestos from the tunnels may take longer than expected, and that the company may be unable to complete the acquisition of the leasehold on the agreed date of 30 June next year.

Explaining its decision for moving the listing, London Tunnels said it could meet the £20m to £30m needed over the first few years of development. It added that it would then look to raise a further £120m in debt and equity to make the tunnels operational.","London Tunnels, which aims to convert an abandoned underground network into a tourist attraction, has ditched plans to float in the capital, instead opting to list in Amsterdam.

Sky News has learnt that Sebastian James is to become the new group chief executive of Veonet, which is owned by the private equity firm PAI Partners and Canada's Ontario Teachers Pension Plan.

He will leave Boots in November, as Sky News revealed on Saturday, and will join Veonet soon afterwards, insiders said.

Veonet was acquired by its current owners in early 2022 from Nordic Capital, another buyout firm.

In the UK, Veonet owns SpaMedica, which performs eye operations such as cataract removals for the NHS.

Overall, the group provides eye care services to more than 2m patients annually across five European markets, including Germany, the Netherlands and Spain.

Dr Markus Hamm, the current Veonet CEO, is retiring but will remain on its board.

Mr James is leaving Boots after its parent, Walgreens Boots Alliance, abandoned plans to sell or float the pharmacy chain for a second time in two years.

His departure will come during the retailer's 175th anniversary year.

Sky News has learnt that Sebastian James, who has run Boots since 2018, will leave the company in November.

City sources said this weekend that he had accepted a new role in the healthcare industry.

His exit comes soon after it emerged that New York-listed Walgreens Boots Alliance (WBA), the British retailer's owner, had decided for the second time in two years against pursuing a sale or stock market flotation of the chain.

An announcement about Mr James's departure is expected in the coming days.

WBA is not yet thought to have lined up a successor.

Mr James, who previously ran the electricals retailer Dixons (now named Currys), recently endorsed Sir Keir Starmer - a notable move because of his long friendship with Lord Cameron, the foreign secretary.

His departure from Boots will come during the Nottingham-based company's 175th year.

Its recent trading performance has been strong, with WBA this week saying that like-for-like sales at Boots during the quarter to the end of May rose by 6% and 5.8% across its retail and pharmacy operations respectively.

An insider said Mr James had overseen a successful turnaround, with market share having grown for 13 successive quarters.

It has been a rare bright spot for WBA, which has had a torrid time and has seen its shares slump.

A WBA spokesperson said this week: ""As Walgreens Boots Alliance continues a strategic review of the Company's assets, we took a critical look at Boots.

""While we believe there is significant interest in this business at the right time, Boots' growth, strategic strength and cashflow remain key contributors to Walgreens Boots Alliance.

""We are committed to continuing to invest in Boots UK and to find innovative ways for this business to fulfill its potential.""

During a previous auction in 2022, only one bidder - a consortium of Apollo Global Management and Reliance Industries - tabled a formal offer worth about £5.5bn.

However, growing concerns about the global economy had triggered severe doubts among large banks which help finance leveraged buyouts, with Boots among the biggest such deals in Europe.

Among the other challenges facing prospective acquirers at the time was finding an adequate solution for Boots' £8bn pension scheme - one of the largest private retirement funds in the UK.

This issue has now been resolved through an insurance deal struck with Legal & General.

Like many retailers, Boots had a turbulent pandemic, announcing 4,000 job cuts in 2020 as a consequence of a restructuring of its Nottingham head office and store management teams.

Shortly before the COVID pandemic, Boots earmarked about 200 of its UK stores for closure, a reflection of changing shopping habits.

Boots' heritage dates back to John Boot opening a herbal remedies store in Nottingham in 1849.

It opened its 1000th UK store in 1933.

In 2006, Boots merged with Alliance Unichem, a drug wholesaler, with the buyout firm KKR acquiring the combined group in an £11bn deal the following year.

In 2012, Walgreens acquired a 45% stake in Alliance Boots, completing its buyout of the business two years later.

Skynews,https://news.sky.com/story/energy-supplier-ovo-to-explore-options-including-sale-13160749,2024-06-29,08:02:00 UTC,Energy supplier OVO to explore options including sale,"Britain's fourth-biggest household energy supplier is lining up bankers to explore options including bringing in a new investor or a sale, 15 years after it launched in a bid to challenge the industry's oligopoly.

Sky News has learnt that OVO Group, which was founded by Stephen Fitzpatrick, is close to hiring Rothschild to assist with a strategic review of the business.

City sources said this weekend that a range of possibilities would be considered during the process, which is expected to take several months.

Money blog: How to split housework fairly

These are likely to include a refinancing - with talks already underway about OVO's existing borrowings - as well as issuing new shares to prospective investors, or a partial or full sale by some of the company's shareholders.

An outright sale of the business is considered by insiders to be unlikely at this point, but is expected to be explored as part of the strategic review.

OVO, which has about four million customers, sits behind Centrica, the owner of British Gas, Octopus Energy and E.ON Next in the rankings of Britain's leading gas and electricity suppliers, according to market share data provided by Ofgem, the industry regulator.

Under Mr Fitzpatrick, who launched OVO in 2009, the company positioned itself as a challenger brand offering superior service to the industry's established players.

OVO's transformational moment came in 2020, when it bought the retail supply arm of SSE, transforming it overnight into one of Britain's leading energy companies.

Its growth has not been without difficulties, with insiders referring to a challenged relationship with Ofgem and a torrent of customer complaints about overcharging.

In recent months, OVO's shareholders have reshaped its leadership team, bringing in the former J Sainsbury chief executive Justin King as its chairman.

In May, Mr King recruited David Buttress, the former Just Eat boss who was briefly Boris Johnson's cost-of-living tsar, as the energy group's new chief executive.

Mr Buttress replaced Raman Bhatia, who left to join Starling Bank.

He is expected to focus on sharpening the company's customer service performance as well as exploring ways to further diversify its products and services.

Key to OVO's valuation will be the growth of its technology platform, Kaluza, which was set up to license its software to other energy suppliers, and provides customers with smart electric vehicle charging and heat pumps.

OVO recently announced that AGL Energy, one of Australia's biggest energy suppliers, had bought a 20% stake in Kaluza at a $500m (£395m) valuation.

Kaluza is understood to be exploring further expansion opportunities in Europe, Japan and the US.

OVO has also entered the electric vehicle car charging sector under the brand Charge Anywhere, adding 34,000 public charging points across the UK.

In 2022, OVO Group made an unadjusted loss of £1.3bn, which it blamed on a decline in the value of energy it had bought in advance to meet future supply commitments.

It said this had ""no cash impact"" in a corporate filing, and that this value would rise as customers used the energy it had bought.

Last summer, the company announced a £200m secondary share sale which saw existing investors Mayfair Equity Partners and Morgan Stanley Investment Management increasing their stakes in the company.

Other investors include Mitsubishi Corporation, the Japanese conglomerate.

Mayfair is thought to hold a stake of over 30%, while Mitsubishi owns approximately 20%.

Mr Fitzpatrick also remains a significant shareholder.

This weekend, it was unclear which of OVO's investors might seek a disposal of their interests, although insiders acknowledged that a sizeable proportion of the company's shares could end up changing hands.

Like its rivals, OVO has been contending with the impact of the industry price cap after a period of enormous price spikes which sent customers' bills soaring.

Last month, Ofgem said the cap would fall in the quarter from July to September by the annualised equivalent of £122, to £1568.

Other big players in the sector include EDF and Scottish Power, which is owned by Spain's Iberdrola.

In recent months, Octopus Energy, run by Greg Jackson, has crystallised a valuation of over £7bn by selling stakes to a number of new investors.

Centrica has a market valuation on the London Stock Exchange of £7.3bn.

Nationwide customers complained on social media platform X they had not received their wages into their accounts.

""These payments are being processed, and will be paid into your account today,"" it added. ""Sorry for any inconvenience this is causing.""

Virgin Money said on X ""like other banks"" it is ""working hard to process the backlog of payments delayed as quickly as possible"".

The bank had earlier alerted customers to delays to payments in and out of accounts and asked users not to try to make payments again if they had received an error message.

Barclays said it was aware of the issue and the team was ""doing everything they can"" to get the ""faster payment system"" back up and running.

The system powers online banking by enabling people to send money between banks digitally, or via phone or in a branch.

Former senior Fujitsu engineer Gareth Jenkins told the Post Office Inquiry he did not hide glitches in the branch accounting system at the trial of Seema Misra in 2010 - widely seen as a crucial test case at the time.

Mrs Misra was jailed for 15 months on the back of his evidence as an expert witness.

On his fourth day in the witness box at the inquiry, Mr Jenkins insisted he was telling the truth about what he knew of Horizon glitches in answers to questions on the scandal from her lawyer Flora Page.

Ms Page described Horizon as an ""out of control monster"" by the time of her client's trial and added that ""hundreds of people had already had their lives ruined to protect it"".

She put it to Mr Jenkins: ""Isn't the truth that you knew Horizon was a monster and it was causing harm?""

He replied: ""No, that's not how I felt.""

Ms Page put to Mr Jenkins that he ""threw mud in the jury's eyes"", to which he said: ""I did not.""

She put it to Mr Jenkins that failing to tell the court that he knew that transactions were being injected at the counter was failing to tell the whole truth.

He said: ""I didn't think that at the time.""

It was put to him that there were ""thousands of known error log entries"", and Mr Jenkins said: ""I'm not sure how many known error log entries there were, I don't know the volumes.""

Ms Page said that during the trial Mr Jenkins was asked if he knew whether there were any problems with the Horizon system that Fujitsu was aware of, and put it to him that the truthful answer would have been ""cash accounts, remote access, tampering, bad error handling, silent faults across the system, the EPOSS code, the terrible code, hardware failures, persistent hardware failures, recovering transactions that were lost"".

Mr Jenkins replied: ""That was not how I understood the question to be.""

""You hid all these issues and problems when you gave evidence against Seema Misra, didn't you?"" Ms Page said.

He replied ""no"", then later added: ""I did not believe that I deliberately hid anything.""

Mr Jenkins, who is facing a police investigation for alleged perjury, told the inquiry in his witness statement that Post Office, which has a power to bring its own prosecutions, had applied pressure on him to support its case.

He claimed Post Office lawyer Warwick Tatford had looked over a draft of his witness statement for Mrs Misra's trial and recommended he ""make some points more strongly in favour of the Post Office"".

He explained how he thought such actions had been ""normal practice"", saying he had not understood his duties of impartiality as an expert witness in trials until 2020, by which time he had been involved in more than a dozen cases.

He later conceded, however, in his evidence that he had seen advice setting out what was expected of him in 2016, explaining that had not been the focus for him in the documents he received.

Also on Thursday, Mr Jenkins told the inquiry where he thought the blame could be laid.

""My feeling was then and is now that the issues to do with this are down to the way Post Office has behaved rather than actual faults in the Horizon system... I believe that I told the truth as I understood it at the time.""

""You were a Fujitsu man doing what Fujitsu needed you to do to protect the monster,"" Ms Page put to him.

Mr Jenkins said: ""I didn't think it was a monster.""

During his evidence, Mr Jenkins has said he was sorry for what happened to Mrs Misra.

She told Sky News on Tuesday that she would not accept that apology.","An expert on the Post Office Horizon IT systems has denied suggestions he was ""protecting the monster"" in evidence he gave to the trial of a sub-postmaster who was wrongly convicted while pregnant.

Sky News has learnt that the cinema chain and its advisers at AlixPartners have begun formally exploring a company voluntary arrangement (CVA) - a mechanism widely used by retailers and restaurant chains during the COVID pandemic to close stores and slash rents.

The details of a potential Cineworld CVA are still to be determined, with no visibility yet about any site closures or rent negotiations with landlords.

However, one insider said that an insolvency mechanism such as a CVA was now far more likely than an outright sale of the business.

Sky News revealed earlier this month that Cineworld had drafted in AlixPartners to consider a sale.

The company trades from more than 100 sites in Britain, including at the Picturehouse chain, and employs thousands of people, although its public relations adviser refused to confirm either figure.

In a statement issued to Sky News earlier in the month, it said: ""Like many businesses, we are continually reviewing our UK operations.""

Cineworld grew under the leadership of the Greidinger family into a global giant of the industry, acquiring chains including Regal in the US in 2018 and the British company of the same name four years earlier.

Its multibillion dollar debt mountain led it into crisis, though, and forced the company into Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection in 2022.

It delisted from the London Stock Exchange last August, having seen its share price collapse amid fears for its survival.

Under the deal struck last year, several billions dollars of debt were exchanged for shares, with a significant sum of new money injected into the company by a group of hedge funds and other investors.

Cineworld also operates in central and Eastern Europe, Israel and the US.

Since it emerged from bankruptcy protection, Cineworld has appointed a new leadership team, installing Eduardo Acuna, who ran Mexican cinema chain Cinepolis's operations in the Americas, as its chief executive.

Eric Foss, a former Pepsi executive, was parachuted in as Cineworld's chairman.

One property industry source previously told Sky News that an attempt by Cineworld to pursue a CVA or other restructuring which compromised landlords was likely to be met with fierce resistance.

In an update on its first growth estimate, the Office for National Statistics (ONS) said gross domestic product (GDP) rose by 0.7% between January and March.

It had originally said on 10 May that output was 0.6% up on the previous three months - a positive figure that brought to an end the shallow recession that struck during the second half of 2023.

Then, the effects of Bank of England interest rate rises to combat inflation were widely blamed by economists for choking off demand.

All the growth during the January-March period was attributable to the services sector, which accounts for almost 80% of the economy.

We have since learned there was zero growth recorded by the ONS for the month of April, with poor weather hitting construction and high streets.

The data is the last from the ONS before the country goes to the polls on 4 July - with the economy, and personal finances especially, among the topics high on voters' minds following the effects of the COVID pandemic and energy-driven cost of living crisis.

The timing of the general election has coincided with fierce debate over whether the Bank should now be cutting interest rates, allowing for an easing in borrowing costs.

At its last policy meeting just over a week ago, the rate-setting committee voted 7-2 to maintain Bank rate at 5.25%.

The minutes of the meeting betrayed continuing worries about the pace of wage growth and stubborn inflation within services.

The Bank fears that a rate rise, at this stage, risks fuelling price growth further as basic salaries grow at a pace of 6%.

The rate of inflation is currently back at its 2% target for the first time in three years.

Despite this gap in favour of consumers, with wage growth outpacing inflation since June last year, the effects of the crises since 2020 have taken their toll, according to campaigners on living standards.

The Resolution Foundation said on Friday real household disposable incomes were lower in early 2024 than they were back in late 2019.

It said growth so far in this parliament was weaker than all but two parliaments since 1910, despite growth over the past year of 2.4%.

The thinktank declared average incomes were £120 a year lower per person over the period since the last election.

Figures such as this get to the heart of the election campaign amid criticism of the main parties' lack of clarity over their tax and spending commitments.

But they also give ammunition to critics of the Bank of England who argue interest rates should come down.

In its financial stability report on Thursday, there was a further nod to pressures ahead as it warned there were still three million mortgage holders yet to feel the pain of higher interest rates in their repayments.

As things stand, financial markets and economists see August or September as the likely months for the first rate cut, barring any new shocks.

Skynews,https://news.sky.com/story/government-sale-of-natwest-stake-to-hit-fresh-milestone-13160305,2024-06-28,09:21:00 UTC,Government sale of NatWest stake to hit fresh milestone,"The government's sale of its stake in NatWest Group will reach a new milestone in the coming days when it falls below the threshold at which the Treasury is treated as a related party under stock exchange rules.

Sky News can reveal the taxpayer's shareholding in the high street lender is likely to be reduced below 20% at some point next week - and possibly on the day of the general election.

Under proposed changes to UK listing rules expected to be adopted later this year, the classification of related parties is to be raised from a 10% shareholding to 20%.

Falling below this level would trigger the related party clause exactly a year later, and mean that NatWest had passed another key milestone in its journey back to full private ownership.

Once the Treasury ceases to be categorised as a related party under the listing rules, it would reduce the bank's administrative burden, according to Whitehall insiders.

The government's stake in NatWest, which once stood at more than 80%, has been steadily reduced in recent months through a trading plan under which the Treasury's stake has been drip-fed into the market.

Separately, NatWest has been using surplus capital to buy stock back from the state, further reducing its stake.

A spokesperson for the bank declined to comment on the prospect of the government's interest falling below 20%, but said: ""We are pleased with the recent momentum in the reduction of HM Treasury's stake in the bank.

""Returning NatWest Group to private ownership is a shared ambition and we believe it is in the best interests of both the bank and all our shareholders.""

The continuing reduction in the government's interest in NatWest comes weeks after the timing of the election scuppered plans for a retail offering of a multibillion pound chunk of its stake.

Under the plans, ordinary investors were to be awarded ""bonus"" shares in the bank if they held onto stock they acquired as part of the offer.

Labour has yet to formally indicate whether it would proceed with the plan if it forms the next government.

A combined retail and institutional placing would put ministers within striking distance of returning NatWest to full private ownership 16 years after it was rescued from the brink of collapse with £45.5bn of public money.

Under Paul Thwaite, whose transition from interim to permanent boss of NatWest was confirmed earlier this year, it has struck a deal to acquire the bulk of Sainsbury's Bank and struck an optimistic tone about its prospects.

NatWest also has a new chairman, Rick Haythornthwaite, who replaced Sir Howard Davies at its annual meeting earlier this year.

It does still face the backdrop, however, of a potential legal challenge from Nigel Farage, the Reform Party leader, who was ""debanked"" by it in controversial circumstances last year.

The ensuing row cost Dame Alison Rose, Mr Thwaite's predecessor, her job.

NatWest, which changed its name from Royal Bank of Scotland Group in an attempt to distance itself from its hubristic overexpansion, was rescued from outright collapse by an emergency bailout that Fred Goodwin, its then boss, likened to ""a drive-by shooting"".

In March, the Treasury ceased to be the controlling shareholder in NatWest as it fell below a key 30% threshold.

The government previously said it was committed to exiting the stake by 2025.

Rachel Reeves, the shadow chancellor, has said Labour remains committed to the plan to sell down the government stake in the bank, so long as it provides value for money.","The government's sale of its stake in NatWest Group will reach a new milestone in the coming days when it falls below the threshold at which the Treasury is treated as a related party under stock exchange rules.

Four people were arrested on Tuesday after being identified at Gatwick Airport and have since been released on bail.

On Thursday, six more people were arrested at an east London community centre ""as part of a publicly-advertised event promoting airport disruption"".

Met officers worked with eight other police forces on Friday to arrest 17 further suspects at their homes across the country.

All the individuals were arrested under a section of the Public Order Act.

The act makes it illegal to conspire to disrupt national infrastructure.

""Our stance is very clear that anyone who compromises the safety and security of airports in London can expect a strong response from officers or security staff.

The company has said it will bring the final closure date to 7 July, from September, as Unite members at the steel plant were due to strike on 8 July.

Cutting emissions

One of the steel blast furnaces is to close at the end of this month in a push to reduce carbon emissions at what is the UK's single largest source of CO2.

But that second closure looks set to take place next month, quickening the end of the plant and the loss of 2,800 jobs - 2,500 in the next year, a further 300 in three years.

It comes despite £500m of taxpayer cash to support the site's transition to cheaper, greener steel production to cut emissions.

The previous fossil-fuel-powered blast furnaces are to be replaced by a single electric arc furnace.

Political intervention

Labour had pleaded with the company to hold fire on any closures before a new government is elected on 4 July.

Senior Labour figures including shadow Welsh secretary Jo Stevens had urged Tata to wait for a possible Labour government so fresh talks could take place.

Unite general secretary Sharon Graham said: ""Unite is fighting for the future of the steel industry. We have secured serious investment from Labour to safeguard jobs.""

Ms Graham described Tata's move as being the ""latest In a long line of threats that won't deter us"".

""The Unite campaign is not about selling jobs, it's about securing the long-term future of steel making in this country for thousands of workers in Port Talbot and South Wales. We call on the real decision-makers in Mumbai to take hold of this dispute, sit down, negotiate and realise that the investment secured will be good for the company and workers.""

The GMB union also voiced its support, saying ""Tata must step back from this irreversible decision and safeguard steelmaking assets. There's a general election in days that could change so much"".

A Tata Steel spokesperson said Unite's strike announcement was made unilaterally and it is ""unfortunately forced to commence legal action to challenge the validity of Unite's ballot"".

""In the coming days, if we cannot be certain that we are able to continue to safely operate our assets in a stable fashion through the period of strike action, we will not have any choice but to pause or stop heavy end operations (including both blast furnaces) on the Port Talbot site.

""That is not a decision we would take lightly, and we recognise that it would prove extremely costly and disruptive throughout the supply chain, but the safety of people on or around our sites will always take priority over everything else.

""The company again calls for Unite to withdraw its industrial action and join Community and GMB unions in giving consideration to the company's proposed memorandum of understanding, which puts forward a wide-ranging proposal including generous employee support packages, training and skills development.""

Wales first minister Vaughan Gething said: ""We will not support the closure of both furnaces.

Seeking Alpha,https://seekingalpha.com/article/4701742-chewy-stock-chwy-rally-will-fade?source=feed_all_articles,2024-06-30,17:59:39 UTC,Chewy: This Stock Rally Will Fade (NYSE:CHWY),"boytsov

After more than a year in the penalty box for slower growth and weaker consumer spending, Chewy (NYSE:CHWY) has been on a recent tear. Driven by both a combination of well-received earnings prints as well as being talked up by the meme stock pundit “Roaring Kitty,” Chewy is now up ~15% year to date.

Yet amid the sharp recent rise, we do have to ask ourselves: how much strength has already been priced in, and can the rally keep going?

Data by YCharts

I last wrote a bullish article on Chewy in March, when the stock was still trading at a mere ~$18 per share. I had argued at the time that a reasonable valuation, share buybacks, and expanding margins would help drive the stock toward a rebound. Since then, Chewy has skyrocketed more than 70%, obliging me to re-assess my previous thesis on this company.

Yes - it’s true that Chewy’s recent Q1 earnings print, released in late May, showed a very positive margin story. Higher gross margins helped to feed substantial growth in adjusted EBITDA and free cash flow, which prompted the company to raise its full-year outlook. But now we do have to ask ourselves: how much of this strength is already priced in?

At current levels, I see a more balanced bull and bear thesis for this company, and I’m downgrading the stock to a neutral rating.

Here are the positives I still see for Chewy:

Beloved consumer brand that is a clear category leader. Chewy has built up quite a lot of brand equity around being a very customer service-oriented company. This has helped the company build up a base of more than 20 million active customers, many of whom have their orders on autoship plans.

Chewy has built up quite a lot of brand equity around being a very customer service-oriented company. This has helped the company build up a base of more than 20 million active customers, many of whom have their orders on autoship plans. Margin expansion was driven by expanding product categories. Chewy's push to grow its own brand (Tylee's), plus focus more on selling higher-margin hardgoods, has proven very effective at producing margin expansion. Gross margins have recently expanded to ~29%, vs. low-20s at the onset of the pandemic. In addition, Chewy's success at passing on price increases to its customers has allowed it to preserve this gross margin progress even in the current inflationary environment.

In addition, Chewy's success at passing on price increases to its customers has allowed it to preserve this gross margin progress even in the current inflationary environment. Nascent opportunities in pet telehealth and pet insurance. The craze in telehealth and doctor consultations via your mobile device is spilling over into the pet world, too. The company's ""Chewy Health"" offering has built out a ""Connect With A Vet"" service, and it also has rolled out a pet pharmacy as well. In August, the company rolled out its ""CarePlus"" pet insurance plan, which was recently bolstered through a new partnership with Lemonade's (LMND) pet insurance vertical. This is a broad, new opportunity for Chewy that can both accelerate its growth and grow its margins.

And yet now, I do see a number of risks as well:

Commoditized product. While Chewy has certainly built up a following with autoship and its reputation for excellent customer service, at the end of the day the company is not selling differentiated goods and competes with brick and mortar pet outlets, both local shops and national chains.

While Chewy has certainly built up a following with autoship and its reputation for excellent customer service, at the end of the day the company is not selling differentiated goods and competes with brick and mortar pet outlets, both local shops and national chains. Decelerating growth. Despite the shift in focus to the margin story, Chewy is still ultimately a low-margin retailer that requires economies of scale; and it hasn’t been able to slow its pace of deceleration.

We can also no longer quite make the argument that Chewy is cheap. At current share prices near $27, the company trades at a market cap of $11.87 billion. And after we net off the $1.14 billion in cash off the company’s latest balance sheet (much of which is earmarked for buybacks), the company’s resulting enterprise value is $10.73 billion.

Meanwhile, as shown in the chart below, the company has updated its guidance to $11.6-$11.8 billion in revenue (4-6% y/y growth) and a 4.1-4.3% adjusted EBITDA margin, compared to a prior outlook of 3.8% adjusted EBITDA margins on the same revenue profile.

Chewy outlook (Chewy Q1 earnings deck)

The midpoint of Chewy’s latest outlook calls for $491.4 million in adjusted EBITDA. This puts the stock’s valuation multiple at 21.8x EV/FY24 adjusted EBITDA.

To me, the stock’s rising margin profile is balanced against slower growth, and I’m not willing to pay a >20x multiple of current-year EBITDA. I’m happily locking in gains (especially as “meme stock rallies” can tend to be shorter-lived in nature) and moving to the sidelines for a better entry point down the road.

Q1 download

Let’s now go through the company’s latest quarterly results in greater detail. The Q1 earnings summary is shown below:

Chewy Q1 results (Chewy Q1 earnings deck)

Revenue grew just 3.1% y/y to $2.88 billion, ahead of Wall Street’s $2.85 billion expectations (2.1% growth). But as can be seen in the chart below, growth has been decelerating sharply over the past few quarters, and fell 120bps sequentially from 4.3% growth in Q4. Only a year ago, Chewy had been growing revenue in the mid-teens.

Chewy trended revenue (Chewy Q1 earnings deck)

The good news: despite weaker macro conditions for discretionary pet spending, Chewy notes that it has been able to retain customers as well as reactivate lapsed customers at a better rate than expected. Per CEO Sumit Singh’s remarks on the Q1 earnings call:

Our Autoship customer base remains healthy and is continuing to grow. Further, on the topic of customers this quarter, we saw some encouraging customer trends. The work we have been doing to sharpen our already strong value proposition, for example, through pet type personalization began to pay off this quarter. Our efforts are driving higher response rates and had a positive effect on net new customers as well as reactivated customers, which were particularly strong in the quarter and up mid-teens relative to the prior year period. Notably for the first time since 2022, both new customer acquisition and reactivations modestly exceeded our internal expectations in Q1.""

Additionally encouraging was a continued trend in rising gross margins. As shown below, gross margins rose 130bps y/y and 150bps sequentially to an all time record of 29.7%. The boost in margins was primarily driven by revenue mix, as the company’s sponsored ads and insurance sales have become a slightly more meaningful percentage of company revenue.

Opex cost controls have also helped to push Adjusted EBITDA up to $163 million: up 47% y/y and also representing an EBITDA margin record of 5.7%, up 170bps y/y.

Key takeaways

In my view, the market has already given Chewy plenty of credit for its goody in profits and margin expansion. With its higher valuation, I’d prefer to de-risk my position and move to the sidelines.","Chewy outlook (Chewy Q1 earnings deck)The midpoint of Chewy’s latest outlook calls for $491.4 million in adjusted EBITDA.

By John R. Mousseau, CFA

The bond market in the second quarter was really two stories. The first part of the quarter saw a continual rise in overall yields that started at the beginning of the year. In other words, a reversion of the bond market rally that was the hallmark of the fourth quarter last year. The ten-year US Treasury (US10Y) rose from 3.88% at the start of the year to hit 4.70% on April 25th. What were the causes? More fear of the Fed – “higher for longer” – and this was buttressed by some strong job numbers early in the year, continuing low jobless claims, and some upward surprises on the monthly inflation front. All of these conspired to have investors move their expectations out longer for the Fed to cut short-term interest rates.

Towards the end of April we started to get some more bond-friendly data. Some softer job numbers, some increases in initial jobless claims, and better news on the inflation front – particularly the May inflation data, which showed 0% monthly growth in CPI and a negative adjustment to PPI. There was also a slowdown in both new and existing home sales as well as an increase in credit card delinquencies. All of these developments can be partially attributed to the higher level of short-term interest rates. Since then, yields have declined, with the ten-year yield moving back to the 4.30% range – a drop of 40 basis points. At this point we are still 70 basis points lower than the peak of last October in yields but 40 basis points higher than year end.

Municipal bond yields increased more than Treasury yields during the quarter. Some of this is reversing the strong relative municipal bond performance during the first quarter of 2024. We think the municipal performance earlier in the year was a combination of investors perceiving a change in tax policy coming out of November’s election along with some fading of Treasuries based on the deficit, Congressional disagreements, and the high percentage of government debt in relation to GDP.

The charts below show the changes in the US Treasury and the AAA municipal yield curves since the end of the year, end of the first quarter, the peak in yields in April, and now. We can see the yield ratio changes and the fact that, at the margin, the tax free muni market has become more attractive in the last two months. Municipal bond supply is running approximately above 30% ahead of last year and will probably end up the year in the $450–470 billion range. And more infrastructure spending is ahead of us.

What are we doing and why are we doing it?

We are keeping duration in the 6.25–6.5-year range on total return tax-free accounts. This is in line where we were after the beginning of the year, when we reined in duration a touch to reflect the large rally in bonds in the fourth quarter. We are being careful on general-obligation debt from big cities. Why? We still feel that there is an adjustment coming in the office real estate arena. This has implications for regional banks but also property taxes, as many of these buildings’ owners will be appealing their current level of property taxes.

We do feel the economy is slowing down at the margin; and while the Federal Reserve has continued to emphasize continuity in the present level of short-term rates, we would not be surprised to see the Fed do one rate cut in September to try and avoid having to do anything at their November meeting, right before the presidential election. If the economy shows further signs of softening, they would have the December meeting to apply another rate cut.

And finally, the yield curves (both Treasury and tax-free muni) are still inverted. The negative Treasury yield curve (three months to ten years) is now in its 17th month. As we have pointed out before, this has always happened in front of an economic slowdown, and this is a long time to have a negative yield curve. But Covid has stretched most economic activity, and the growth of private credit has filled in in areas where regional banks have pulled back.

We hope everybody enjoys the July 4th week. Happy Independence Day!

Seeking Alpha,https://seekingalpha.com/article/4701735-realty-income-still-a-reason-to-be-bullish?source=feed_all_articles,2024-06-30,16:45:02 UTC,Realty Income: Still A Reason To Be Bullish (NYSE:O),"Maxxa_Satori

The world of REITs is vast, with all sorts and sizes of companies for investors to choose from. One of the biggest players out there, however, is undoubtedly Realty Income (NYSE:O), a diverse REIT with assets that cater to grocery stores, convenience stores, dollar stores, restaurants, health and fitness centers, automotive service companies, and more. About 79.6% of the company's annualized contractual rent is dedicated to the retail space. However, the company also has exposure to the industrial space, as well as gaming. Most of the firm’s revenue comes from The US market. But it is truly diverse from a geographical perspective, with 11.1% of annualized contractual rent, for instance, coming from the UK.

The last article that I wrote about Realty Income was published in the middle of March of this year. At that time, I pointed out the multi-trillion dollar opportunity that existed for investors. To be precise, the total addressable market for the US alone for the business was estimated to be worth about $5.4 trillion. And in Europe, the opportunity is about $8.5 trillion. In that article, I acknowledged that shares were not exactly the cheapest. But they were priced similar to other comparable enterprises, and the high quality of the company justified a ‘buy’ rating. Given the time that has passed, as well as some new developments that popped up, I think it's only appropriate to revisit the picture. And what I found confirms that I was not wrong in my prior assessment of the business, even though shares have marginally underperformed the broader market since the publication of that article.

Things are looking good

Fundamentally speaking, things are going really well for Realty Income and its investors. Revenue in the first quarter of the 2024 fiscal year, for instance, came in at $1.26 billion. That's 33.5% higher than the $944.4 million reported one year earlier. A small portion of this growth came from same store rental revenue growth that was driven by rent escalators that the company has, as well as by new lease contracts being signed by customers. Foreign currency fluctuations also helped slightly. But the largest contributor to the $316.1 million year-over-year growth in revenue for the company, by far, was a $265.7 million increase caused by properties acquired during 2023 and 2024. This included the properties that the company acquired in early January of this year when the business completed its merger with Spirit Realty Capital in a move that brought to the business 2,018 additional properties.

Author - SEC EDGAR Data

With revenue rising, profitability metrics for the business also improved. Operating cash flow, as an example, increased from $731.2 million to $778.7 million. If we adjust for changes in working capital, the increase was even more significant, from $650.7 million to $785.4 million. There are, of course, other profitability metrics to pay attention to. One of these is FFO, or funds from operations. This metric increased from $684.3 million to $785.7 million. The adjusted figure for this grew even more, from $650.7 million to $862.9 million. And lastly, EBITDA for the business expanded from $843.6 million to $1.15 billion.

So far, things are going really well for investors. This is evidenced by a couple of factors. For starters, in May of this year, the company announced that it was increasing its common stock dividend by 2.1%. This was followed up by another modest increase in the firm's dividend in June of this year. This marked the 126th dividend increase since the company became listed on the New York Stock Exchange. It's also the fourth dividend increase that the company has seen this year, and it marked the 648th consecutive monthly dividend throughout the company's 55-year operating history.

Realty Income

As great as this is to see, it pales in comparison to management's announcement on June 4th of this year that the company is increasing guidance for 2024. There are many working parts to this guidance, so instead of detailing out each one, I would refer you to the image above. It shows prior guidance compared to the revised guidance that we should rely on now. Most notably, adjusted FFO per share should now come in between $4.15 and $4.21. At the midpoint, that's a bit higher than the $4.17 previously anticipated. Even more significant, to me, is the fact that the company announced plans to spend $3 billion on investment opportunities this year. That's 50% higher than the $2 billion management was previously expecting. And none of this includes the aforementioned merger that occurred in January.

Author - SEC EDGAR Data

If we assume the company's share count does not change from where it is right now, then the increase in guidance should result in adjusted FFO of about $3.49 billion. FFO should be around $3.57 billion if this is the case. If we assume that other profitability metrics should rise at the same rate, this would translate to adjusted operating cash flow of about $3.50 billion and EBITDA of approximately $4.55 billion. In the table above, you can see these figures and how they compare against results seen for 2023.

Author - SEC EDGAR Data

With this data taken into consideration, I then decided to value the stock. This can be seen in the chart above. As you can see, the stock looks much more attractive on a forward basis than if we were to use 2023 figures. But in all fairness, this is more of an apples to oranges comparison since the 2023 figures do not factor in any cash flows from the aforementioned merger. As part of my analysis, I then decided to compare Realty Income to five similar firms, as shown in the table below. I did this using only two of the four valuation metrics so that I could minimize complexity. On a price to operating cash flow basis, three of the five companies were cheaper than Realty Income. But when it comes down to the EV to EBITDA approach, this number drops to two of the five.

Company Price / Operating Cash Flow EV / EBITDA Realty Income 13.0 15.5 Simon Property Group (SPG) 12.9 13.7 Kimco Realty (KIM) 12.9 16.8 Regency Centers (REG) 15.0 17.2 Federal Realty Investment Trust (FRT) 14.9 17.5 NNN REIT (NNN) 12.2 14.9 Click to enlarge

Takeaway

As things stand, Realty Income does look to be more or less fairly valued compared to similar enterprises. But this doesn't mean that investors shouldn't be bullish. Management continues to make big investments focused on the future and, for such a high-quality company, its trading multiples are not unrealistic. Management seems very bullish, as evidenced by the continued dividend increases and the uptick in guidance. The big investments being made this year should do well to further create value for investors down the road. Given these factors, I do not think that rating the company a ‘buy’ was a bad decision. Rather, I suspect that the company will just need additional time to realize the upside it should enjoy.","The last article that I wrote about Realty Income was published in the middle of March of this year.

Scoreboard check! We've hit the mid-year mark of 2024, and it's time to tally up our top 15 Crypto Predictions for 2024 that we outlined at the end of last year. Spoiler alert: our home-field referee awarded us 95 out of 150 possible points.

From bitcoin's (BTC-USD) price hitting all-time highs to Solana's (SOL-USD) continued rise, our predictions have been put to the test. Let's break down the play-by-play of where we nailed it and where we missed the mark. Join us as we review the key developments and trends shaping the crypto market this year so far.

1. The U.S. Recession and the First Spot Bitcoin ETPs

Prediction: The U.S. would enter a recession in the first half of 2024, and the first spot bitcoin ETPs would launch with significant inflows, keeping Bitcoin above $30k.

Review: Although there are clear signs of economic slowing, with GDP slowing to a 1.3% annualized growth rate, the U.S. has not officially entered a recession. Key indicators like consumer spending and corporate earnings have shown resilience, mitigating the impacts of inflation and supply chain issues. However, the U.S. yield curve has been inverted for more than 700 days, the longest such streak in bond market history, often a precursor to recession. Jobless claims and corporate bankruptcy filings have also risen.

As for the spot bitcoin ETPs, the approval and launch of the first spot bitcoin ETPs on January 11, 2024, was a significant milestone. The ETPs saw overwhelming demand, with inflows surpassing $2 billion in the first month alone. This influx of investment played a crucial role in driving bitcoin to an all-time high of $73,000 in March and maintaining its price above $30k throughout the year. The success of these ETPs has provided a new, regulated avenue for investors to gain exposure to Bitcoin, significantly boosting its market appeal and stability.

2. Bitcoin Halving

Prediction: The Bitcoin halving in April 2024 would proceed without major issues, and post-halving, bitcoin would rise above $48k.

Review: The Bitcoin halving event in April 2024 occurred without any significant disruptions, demonstrating the network's stability and robustness. This halving reduced the block reward from 6.25 BTC to 3.125 BTC, effectively decreasing the rate at which new Bitcoin is introduced into circulation. Contrary to expectations of a brief consolidation period post-halving, bitcoin surged to a new all-time high of $73,000 in March, well ahead of the halving. This early rally was likely fueled by the anticipation of the halving and the massive inflows from newly launched bitcoin ETPs. Bitcoin's price remains strong at $67,500, far surpassing the $48k target we had set post-halving.

3. Bitcoin's All-Time High in Q4

Prediction: Bitcoin will reach an all-time high in Q4 2024, driven by political changes and regulatory optimism.

Review: Bitcoin's price soared to a new all-time high of $73,000 in March 2024, much earlier than our Q4 prediction. This surge was driven by the approval and subsequent success of the spot bitcoin ETPs in January, which attracted significant investment and heightened market confidence. The early achievement of this milestone was facilitated by positive regulatory developments and growing institutional interest. Although this prediction came to fruition ahead of schedule, the factors we predicted to drive the new high-regulatory progress and market optimism-were spot-on. The current price of $67,500 reflects the sustained interest and confidence in Bitcoin as a leading digital asset.

4. Ethereum Won't Flip Bitcoin in 2024

Prediction: Ethereum (ETH-USD) would not surpass Bitcoin in market cap but outperform mega-cap tech stocks.

Review: Ethereum remains well behind Bitcoin in market capitalization, particularly in light of Bitcoin's record-breaking performance this year. Despite this, Ethereum has had a strong year, outpacing many of the largest tech stocks in terms of growth and market performance. Its ecosystem continues to expand, driven by advancements like the EIP-4844 upgrade and the growing adoption of Layer 2 solutions. Despite not surpassing Bitcoin, Ethereum's resilience and robust growth align well with our prediction of its strong market performance relative to major tech stocks.

5. Ethereum Layer 2 (L2) Dominance

Prediction: Post EIP-4844, Ethereum Layer 2 solutions would capture the majority of EVM-compatible TVL and volume.

Review: While the rollout of EIP-4844 has significantly boosted the adoption of Ethereum Layer 2 solutions, we are still waiting to see L2s attract more TVL or DEX activity than Ethereum. However, while Ethereum TVL share vs. L2s is roughly where it was at the beginning of 2024, DEX Volumes are slowly transitioning to L2s. This is mainly because Ethereum has made a dedicated data layer for L2s to post data. This moved activity from Ethereum's transaction layer, freeing up block space and making transactions on Ethereum less expensive. While L2s cost substantially less than Ethereum to use, often 100x cheaper, many participants still choose to pay higher Ethereum fees. This may be due to the stickiness of Ethereum TVL, the broader range of trading venues, and the large supply of tradeable assets.

Within L2s, the consolidation of market share among the leading solutions is evident, with Base and Arbitrum seizing the majority (~80) of DEX Volume and TVL (>50%). The consolidation amongst L2s demonstrates the power of composability and network effect.

6. NFT Activity Rebounds

Prediction: The NFT market experienced a resurgence in the first half of 2024 compared to the latter half of 2023, predominantly on Ethereum, which remains the leader in NFT activity. New high-profile collections and ongoing interest have driven trading volumes upward, although these volumes are still far from the all-time highs seen in 2021. An exciting development has been the introduction of NFTs on the Bitcoin network through the Ordinals protocol, adding a new dimension to the market and attracting a fresh wave of investors and collectors. Despite this positive trend, the overall NFT volume far from its previous peaks. Instead, some of the speculative trading volume has shifted towards meme coins, which have supplanted NFTs in attracting speculative investors

7. Binance Loses Top Spot

Prediction: Binance (BNB-USD) would lose its position as the top spot trading exchange.

Review: Despite regulatory scrutiny and increasing competition, Binance has retained its position as the leading centralized exchange by trading volume in 2024. However, its dominance is being challenged by competitors like OKX, Bybit, and Coinbase (COIN), which have gained market share. Binance's deep liquidity and extensive user base support its leadership, but the narrowing gap with its rivals suggests a more competitive landscape. Although Binance has yet to lose its top spot and still holds over half of all spot volumes, the intensifying competition highlights the changing dynamics in the centralized exchange market.

8. Stablecoin Market Cap Growth

Prediction: The stablecoin market cap would reach a new all-time high, with USDC surpassing USDT in market share.

Review: The stablecoin market has continued to grow in 2024, but it has yet to achieve the $200 billion milestone. USDC has been gaining ground, particularly among institutional users, due to its reputation for regulatory compliance. However, USDT remains the dominant stablecoin, primarily because of its entrenched position on Tron, which accounts for ~50% of USDT supply and widespread usage in trading. The dynamics between USDC and USDT show a trend toward increasing competition, with USDC closing the gap but not yet overtaking USDT. The stablecoin market's growth and evolving competitive landscape reflects our prediction, though the shift in dominance is still developing.

9. DEX Market Share Increase

Prediction: Decentralized exchanges (DEXes) would capture a larger share of the spot trading market.

Review: Decentralized exchanges have continued to grow in market share throughout 2024. The improved user interfaces, lower fees, and enhanced liquidity offered by DEXes have attracted more traders. High-throughput blockchains and Layer 2 solutions have further facilitated this growth by providing faster and cheaper transactions. The ongoing trend towards self-custody and decentralized finance ('DEFI') supports this shift, with DEXes capturing an increasingly significant portion of the spot trading market. This aligns well with our prediction and underscores the evolving preference for decentralized trading platforms.

10. Bitcoin Yield Opportunities

Prediction: Remittances and smart contract platforms would create new yield opportunities for Bitcoin.

Review: Bitcoin's role in remittances has expanded in 2024, particularly in regions with high remittance flows and limited access to traditional financial services. Platforms leveraging Bitcoin and Layer 2 solutions like the Lightning Network have made transactions faster and cheaper. Additionally, yield opportunities for Bitcoin holders have emerged through staking and lending protocols that offer returns on bitcoin assets. These developments align well with our prediction, as they enhance Bitcoin's utility beyond mere transactions and provide new ways for holders to earn yields. However, the full potential of these opportunities is still unfolding, with ongoing adoption and innovation.

Rating: 4/10

11. Breakout Blockchain Game

Prediction: A blockchain game would surpass 1 million daily active users.

Review: While several blockchain games have seen significant user engagement in 2024, none have consistently reached the 1 million daily active users milestone. High-quality titles like Illuvium (ILV-USD) and Guild of Guardians have attracted large communities but are still building their user bases. The integration of blockchain technology in gaming continues to evolve, with improvements in-game mechanics and user experience driving growth. Despite not hitting the 1 million user mark, these developments suggest a strong foundation for future success in the blockchain gaming sector. The potential for a breakout hit remains promising as the market matures.

Rating: 5/10

12. Solana's Continued Rise

Prediction: Solana would become a top 3 blockchain by market cap, TVL, and active users and join the ETPs wars.

Review: Solana will continue to grow and strengthen its position in the blockchain ecosystem in 2024. It ranks highly in market capitalization, total value locked (TVL), and active users, though it has not yet cracked the top 3 in all these categories. Solana's ecosystem has attracted a wide range of projects and users, contributing to its strong market presence. However, solana-based ETPs have not yet emerged, contrary to our expectations. Despite this, Solana's ongoing growth and innovation highlight its significant impact and potential in blockchain.

13. Adoption of DePin Networks

Prediction: Decentralized physical infrastructure networks like Hivemapper and Helium would see significant adoption.

Review: Decentralized physical infrastructure (DePin) networks such as Hivemapper and Helium have made notable progress in 2024. Hivemapper has expanded its mapping capabilities, and Helium has increased its subscriber base for its decentralized wireless network. These networks use blockchain technology to create community-driven services, offering an alternative to traditional centralized systems. While adoption has grown, these platforms are still in the early stages of capturing significant market share from established giants like Google and traditional telecom providers. The potential for disruptive growth remains, but widespread adoption is yet to be fully realized.

14. New Corporate Crypto Accounting

Prediction: New FASB guidelines would rejuvenate corporate crypto holdings, and Coinbase would break out L2 revenues.

Review: The Financial Accounting Standards Board ('FASB') guidelines allowing corporates to report mark-to-market gains on crypto assets are set to take effect in 2025, with anticipation building throughout 2024. Some non-crypto companies have already added BTC to their treasuries, and these include US publicly traded health tech company Semler Scientific (SMLR, $40M), wealth and payments business MOGO ($5M), Japanese hotel services company Metaplanet ($7.2M). But wide-scale adoption has yet to occur. Within crypto, Defi Technologies recently added $7.5M in BTC to its treasury. However, the adoption of BTC by a greater treasury has yet to materialize.

Coinbase, while advancing its Layer 2 (L2) solutions like Base Protocol, has not reported L2-specific revenues in its filings and instead tucks it under the broader category of ""Subscriptions and Services."". The corporate adoption of crypto assets is increasing, with more firms exploring blockchain applications and digital asset holdings. Our prediction points towards future developments that are still on the horizon, with current trends suggesting growing interest and preparation for these changes.

15. KYC and DeFi Reconciliation

Prediction: KYC-enabled DeFi applications would gain significant traction.

Review: The integration of Know Your Customer ('KYC') features into decentralized finance ('DEFI') platforms has begun to take shape in 2024. Leading protocols like Uniswap have started experimenting with KYC-enabled functionalities to attract institutional liquidity and comply with regulatory requirements. These developments are bridging the gap between traditional finance and DeFi, making it easier for institutions to engage in decentralized ecosystems. While adopting KYC features is still early, it has generated significant interest and could transform how DeFi operates. The traction gained so far supports our prediction, although widespread adoption is still forthcoming.

Rating: 6/10

Conclusion

Our mid-year review shows that while some predictions have materialized as expected, others are still unfolding or have missed the mark. Bitcoin's unprecedented rally and the successful launch of spot bitcoin ETPs have been standout developments. We will continue to track these trends and incorporate the above data into future updates. Stay tuned!

Moreover, the extent to which Web3 companies or digital assets utilize blockchain technology may vary, and it is possible that even widespread adoption of blockchain technology may not result in a material increase in the value of such companies or digital assets. Digital asset prices are highly volatile, and the value of digital assets, and Web3 companies, can rise or fall dramatically and quickly. If their value goes down, there's no guarantee that it will rise again. As a result, there is a significant risk of loss of your entire principal investment. Digital assets are not generally backed or supported by any government or central bank and are not covered by FDIC or SIPC insurance. Accounts at digital asset custodians and exchanges are not protected by SPIC and are not FDIC insured. Furthermore, markets and exchanges for digital assets are not regulated with the same controls or customer protections available in traditional equity, option, futures, or foreign exchange investing. Digital assets include, but are not limited to, cryptocurrencies, tokens, NFTs, assets stored or created using blockchain technology, and other Web3 products. Web3 companies include but are not limited to, companies that involve the development, innovation, and/or utilization of blockchain, digital assets, or crypto technologies. All investing is subject to risk, including the possible loss of the money you invest. As with any investment strategy, there is no guarantee that investment objectives will be met and investors may lose money. Diversification does not ensure a profit or protect against a loss in a declining market. Past performance is no guarantee of future performance. © Van Eck Associates Corporation. Click to enlarge

Seeking Alpha,https://seekingalpha.com/article/4701726-robinhood-cyclical-platform-upside-rating-upgrade?source=feed_all_articles,2024-06-30,15:39:21 UTC,Robinhood: Cyclical Platform Upside (Rating Upgrade) (NASDAQ:HOOD),"LorenzoT81

Shares of Robinhood Markets (NASDAQ:HOOD) have been on a tear in 2024 due to investor sentiment towards equity and crypto asset classes improving considerably. With Bitcoin (BTC-USD) and the S&P 500 making new all-time highs this year, trading activity on retail-focused investment platforms like Robinhood Markets has significantly increased, resulting in an upsurge in net deposits, customers' investment assets and earnings. The profit picture has also improved as well on the back of improving customer monetization. Shares are not cheap, however, with a P/E ratio in excess of 40X, but Robinhood is worthy of a rating upgrade nonetheless!

Data by YCharts

Previous rating

I rated shares of Robinhood a sell back in January 2022 due to a downward trend in monthly active users as well as weakening customer monetization. However, the setup has improved in the last six months especially, chiefly because risk assets have seen strong returns, and in some cases, cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin reached new all-time highs. This backdrop has led to an inflow of new deposits to Robinhood as well as a swelling of investment assets. Current platform trends are favorable and as long as the stock market proves to be resilient, Robinhood has cyclical earnings upside.

Robinhood experiences fundamentally strong platform tailwinds

Robinhood delivered very strong results in Q1'24 and reported a 31% Q/Q surge in revenues, driven chiefly by strong asset returns in capital markets. Due to Robinhood’s ability to gather new deposits and assets on its platform, the company has been able to improve its monetization which, during the last bear market, weakened materially. Robinhood’s platform monetization, as measured by a growing average revenue per user/ARPU figure increased 28% quarter over quarter to $104/user and almost doubled compared to Q1’24. Growth in total platform revenues as well as higher ARPU have been driven mainly by an increase in variable fee streams related to transaction activity: the platform's transaction-based revenues soared 65% Q/Q in Q1’24 to $329M.

Robinhood

The truth of the matter is that the platform’s growth is highly cyclical and overall dependent on investors' attitudes toward risk and return expectations. New customers tend to gravitate to the investment and trading platform when markets make good news and money can be earned simply by jumping on the bandwagon and riding a bullish wave in either the crypto or stock market. During bullish times like these, it is much easier for companies like Robinhood to attract new customers and new investment capital (deposits).

Driven by positive news about stock valuations this year, Robinhood signed on a ton of new customers to its platform. In the first fiscal quarter alone, Robinhood acquired half a million new customers which brought the customer total to 23.9M.

Robinhood

The account growth trajectory is favorable and Robinhood has been able to consistently attract new customers even over longer period of time. However, the most recent jump is a out of the ordinary and related, in my opinion, to strong asset performance across asset classes in FY 2024 and investors fear over missing out.

Another key metric that is worth tracking is Robinhood’s 'assets under custody' which are investment assets on the Robinhood platform that are held on behalf of customers. These custody assets have surged lately, chiefly due to a broad increase in stock and crypto valuations. Robinhood's custody assets amounted to $130B in Q1'24, showing a massive 26% increase Q/Q.

Robinhood

High P/E valuation, but earnings growth looks good

HOOD is profitable and generating some solid earnings growth. I expect this earnings growth to be sustained in a rising market. The platform achieved two consecutive quarters of positive EPS growth lately and reached record GAAP earnings in Q1’24 of $157M. In the last four quarter, Robinhood was profitable in three. For the second-quarter, given the strong performance of the AI sector (semiconductors, Data Centers) which has driven the stock market to new highs, I believe Robinhood will see its third consecutive quarter of positive EPS in Q2'24.

Robinhood

In my last work on Robinhood two-and-a-half years ago, the platform was not profitable, but it is now which reduces risks for investors. I am comparing Robinhood, in terms of valuation, to Coinbase Global (COIN) and Interactive Brokers (IBKR) because all platforms are mainly retail investor-oriented, depend on transaction growth as revenue drivers and are seeing strong cyclical earnings upside in rising stock/crypto markets.

Robinhood has seen rapidly rising EPS estimates for FY 2024 and FY 2025 this year, due to the factors explained above.

Data by YCharts

Currently Robinhood is valued at a price-to-earnings ratio of 27.4X which is significantly (73%) above the 1-year average P/E ratio of 15.6X and not a cheap P/E even for a growth company with cyclical profit upside. The reason for the sharp upside revaluation is the swelling of investment assets, improving customer monetization and the platform achieving the inflection point of (fairly) consistent GAAP profitability in the last twelve months. Coinbase is significantly higher valued with a P/E ratio of 51.4X due to the fact that the platform is enormously profitable during bullish stretches in the crypto market.

In my opinion, Robinhood could trade at a 20-22X P/E given the improving fundamentals in the business, but I am personally not comfortable paying a higher multiplier, simply because the platform's earnings potential is largely outside of the control of Robinhood. General trends in the stock and crypto markets determine the flow of deposits and earnings upside of HOOD and while the picture currently looks good, these trends can change abruptly and quickly put cyclical trading platforms back into a situation of an earnings recession. The lack of long term earnings visibility is therefore the reason why I am up-grading HOOD only to hold. A 20-22X P/E ratio, which I consider to properly reflect the upside and risks of Robinhood, calculate to a fair value in the region of $17-18 per-share.

Data by YCharts

Risks with Robinhood

Robinhood is a retail-oriented investment platform and therefore exposed to cyclical earnings risks. Retail-focused marketplaces or investment services tend to do well when the market is making good news and investors feel they are missing out on investment gains. As a result, platforms like Robinhood or Coinbase Global can do extremely well when investors have an appetite for risk. If this risk tolerance deteriorates, likely on the back of falling stock and crypto valuations or the appearance of a recession, Robinhood would likely see a drastic decline in its assets under custody, net deposits and ARPU.

Final thoughts

A rising tide lifts all boats: Robinhood is an investment and trading platform that tends to do really well when capital markets are delivering strong returns and stock/crypto valuations are broadly rising. In FY 2024, the backdrop of soaring crypto prices, which caused Bitcoin to reach a new all-time high, and the S&P 500 trading at record highs as well, have made Robinhood more attractive as a destination for retail investors' capital. As a result, Robinhood is seeing a significant surge in revenues, platform assets and earnings which is likely to continue in the near term. However, Robinhood's shares are not cheap and I believe that the 27.4X P/E ratio overvalues the platform's cyclical earnings upside.","This backdrop has led to an inflow of new deposits to Robinhood as well as a swelling of investment assets.

Introduction & Investment Thesis

ServiceNow (NYSE:NOW) is an end-to-end workflow automation platform for enterprises that has slightly underperformed the S&P 500 and Nasdaq 100 this year. I initiated a “hold” rating on the stock before its earnings, with my thesis predicated on the belief that the stock’s price seemed to have fully priced in management’s forward guidance even though the company has strong underlying fundamentals. While the stock dropped more than 11% after I issued my rating, it has since climbed and is currently up 8.77% since the time of my writing, outperforming the S&P 500.

The company reported its Q1 FY24 earnings on April 24, where revenue and earnings exceeded expectations. The company is seeing strong success in landing large enterprises where its new deals with Average Contract Value (“ACV”) of $5M+ have grown 100% YoY. Simultaneously, it is also seeing success in deepening adoption of its solution suite, with customers above $1M+ in ACV growing 14.5% YoY to 1933 customers. This is driven by the company's robust genAI product innovation roadmap, where it is seeing customers adopting its Now Assist AI across Technology and Operations workflow solutions in order to unlock business value across use cases.

While management believes it will be able to grow its Subscription revenue by 20% annually every year until FY26, while improving its non-GAAP operating margin by 100 basis points every year in its latest Investor Presentation, I believe that its current valuation has fully priced in its future growth prospects with little to no upside from its current levels. Plus, there is a possibility that businesses may start to optimize their AI spending as they slowly start to assess the ROI on all their AI initiatives. Assessing the “good” and the ""bad,"" I have decided to stay on the sidelines given the risk-reward of the stock and rate it a “hold” at its current levels.

The good: Strong Subscription growth as $1M+ ACV customers expand, robust product innovation as genAI adoption grows and profitability improves.

ServiceNow reported its Q1 FY24 earnings where revenue grew 24% YoY to $2.597B driven by strength in Subscription revenue where the company continued to close new deals with ACV of $5M+, growing 100% YoY, as it strengthens its position as the AI platform for business transformation. Simultaneously, its Current Remaining Performance Obligations (“cRPO”) grew 21% YoY above expectation as the company continues to see deepening adoption and expansion of its solution suite with 1933 customers with at least $1M in ACV, which grew 14.5% YoY.

Q1 FY24 Earnings Slides: Growing number of customers with $1M+ ACV

During the earnings call, management continued to highlight AI as a central theme in its innovation roadmap as companies are adopting Now Assist AI across their Technology Workflow solutions, such as ITSM (IT Service Management) and ITOM (IT Operations Management), to accelerate value from their AI spend as they speed up issue resolution for IT operators and improve self-service experiences by creating AI-powered conversations with real-time localization. As a result, ITSM and ITOM were present in 16 out of 20 top deals during the quarter, with companies such as Hitachi Energy, Equinix, IBM, BNY Mellon, and numerous companies internationally, partnering with ServiceNow to unlock business value across use cases. At the same time, according to their 2024 Investor Presentation, 98% of net new ACV (“NNACV”) came from multi-product deals in 2023, with the NNACV for Pro Plus growing at the fastest rate in the company’s history. Plus, ServiceNow also expanded its partnership with Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) to integrate its Now Assist AI and Copilot to build new GenAI capabilities and boost employee experience.

One thing that stood out to me was that unlike the general weakness in the software space with companies such as Salesforce (NYSE:CRM), MongoDB (NASDAQ:MDB), and UiPath (NYSE:PATH) and more reporting longer sales cycles and increasing deal scrutiny in their latest quarter, as they fight for a zero sum IT budget, with businesses increasingly deploying budgets for AI proof-of-concepts, ServiceNow is not experiencing the weakness at all. In fact, Bill McDermott, CEO of ServiceNow, said that “its strategic relevance has never been higher,"" especially as business workflows in enterprises will be engineered with genAI. Given the past decade where organizations have accumulated too many systems and apps with low data quality and higher vulnerability to cybersecurity risks, CEOs are increasingly driving vendor consolidation towards fully integrated platforms to gain pricing advantage and operational efficiency, while getting immediate time to value from their genAI projects, which is where ServiceNow is well positioned, especially as it launched its Washington D.C. platform, which includes new genAI features, along with releasing StarCoder2 in partnership with Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) and Hugging Face, which is a family of open-access LLMs, which will enable developers to build enterprise applications with business-specific data more efficiently.

Shifting gears to profitability, the company generated $791M in non-GAAP operating income with a margin of 30%, which improved 400 basis points YoY driven by streamlining operational efficiencies as well as driving higher ACV per customer given its “land and expand” based go-to-market model along with superior sales efficiency.

Q1 FY24 Earnings Slides: Expanding profitability as it streamlines OpEx

The bad: Future projections could be optimistic, especially if we see AI spend optimization among companies.

Although the company is landing larger customers with more products and higher ACV, while time to hit $1M in ACV has significantly improved with newer cohorts to 2 years, with AI-powered experiences providing opportunities to upsell, there could be a possibility that it sees its revenue growth slow down once the companies move into the phase where they assess ROI from these AI projects, leading to some extent of optimization of AI spending in those phases where companies such as ServiceNow will see a plateau in its revenue growth. Although the company estimates that it will be able to grow its subscription revenue by 20% until FY26, while improving profitability at the same time, there is a likelihood that management is overly optimistic in extrapolating the current strength in acquiring large customers and expansion rate amongst existing customers into its future projections.

Revisiting my valuation: ServiceNow remains a “hold”.

Looking forward, the company expects to grow its subscription revenues by 21.5% YoY in FY24, and taking it as a proxy for the rate of overall revenue growth, it should generate $10.89B in revenue. Assuming that the company is able to grow its revenue at the rate of management’s projection of 20% annually into FY26, as it continues to see success in acquiring large customers with higher ACV while deepening adoption within its existing customer base across its solution suite, where it is driving genAI-led product innovation, it should generate $15.68B in revenue in FY26.

2024 Investor Presentation: Management's Subscription growth projection

From a profitability standpoint, management expects to generate a 29% margin in non-GAAP operating income and believes that it will be able to improve its margins by 100 basis points on a non-GAAP basis yearly, as it is able to streamline its operating expenses. Therefore, assuming that it reaches a non-GAAP operating margin of 31% by FY26, it should generate $4.8B in non-GAAP operating income, which will be equivalent to a present value of $4.017B when discounted at 10%.

2024 Investor Presentation: Future profitability expectations from the management

Taking the S&P 500 as a proxy, where its companies grow their earnings on average by 8% over a 10-year period with a price-to-earnings ratio of 15-18, I believe ServiceNow should trade at least at 2.5 times the multiple, given the growth rate of its earnings during this period of time. This will translate to a PE ratio of 42, or a price target of $811, which represents an upside of just 3.2% from its current levels.

Author's Valuation Model

My final verdict and conclusions

There is no doubt that ServiceNow has been executing splendidly as it focused its go-to-market strategy towards attracting larger enterprises with higher ACV while simultaneously deepening adoption among its existing customer base across its solutions suite, with its robust genAI-led product innovation unlocking business value across use cases and expanding profitability at the same time. While it has consecutively beaten its revenue and earnings forecasts over the last four quarters, there is a possibility that enterprises enter a phase over the coming business cycles where they begin to optimize their AI spend as they assess the ROI on these initiatives. At the same time, I believe that the current price has fully priced in the future growth estimates that have been set by management during the earnings call as well as at its Investor Presentation, leaving it little to no room for substantial upside from its current levels. This is also at a time when the S&P 500 is reaching new all-time highs with an elevated PE ratio of 21-22, which is extended from its five- and 10-year averages of 17.7 and 19.1, respectively, increasing the likelihood of a sizable pullback in the short term, which will also affect ServiceNow in the process. Therefore, I will stay on the sidelines at the moment as I believe the risk-reward doesn’t look attractive and rate the stock a “hold”.","The company reported its Q1 FY24 earnings on April 24, where revenue and earnings exceeded expectations.

The fund, composed of companies that are into oil production, drilling, refining, and transportation, found itself among the worst-performing S&P 500 sectors for the one-month period, trailing down 0.62%.

The ETF on a YTD basis, however, had risen 8.3% but was still far away from the near 15% rise in the benchmark index for the same period. Crude oil futures (CL1:COM) have risen 11.9%, while the S&P 500 Energy Index (SP500-1010) has risen 9.1% to date.

Within the index, the Energy Equipment & Services Index (SP500-101010) fell 5.7%, while the Oil, Gas, and Consumable Fuels Index (SP500-101020) rose 10.6% to date.

U.S. stock fund flows into and out of the energy sector have been in the red for most weeks in the second quarter of 2023. The energy-focused ETF has had a net outflow of $613.89 million for the quarter.

What Quantitative Measures Say

XLE has a Buy rating from Seeking Alpha’s Quant Rating system with a score of 4.05 out of 5, supported by A+ in liquidity and A in the expenses category. The ETF got an A- for momentum. However, it got a B+ for dividends and a D- for risks.

What Analysts Say

Seeking Alpha contributor JR Research said in their June 14 report that XLE's solid ""B+"" momentum grade underscores the robustness of its buying sentiment. They added that the recent pessimism doesn't suggest a significant trend reversal into a downtrend bias. XLE's relatively attractive dividend yield of 3.3% should attract income investors as the Fed moves closer to cutting interest rates.

“The energy sector's earnings growth estimates aren't falling off a cliff. The stakeholders have remained disciplined in their production capacity, helping to keep crude oil prices relatively high. As seen with the dip-buying confidence... Saudi Arabia's influence cannot be understated. The growth normalization in EVs underscores the complexities of the energy transition thesis. To bolster the energy requirements of the AI upcycle, more robust data center growth estimates will likely require the participation of all energy players. In other words, I have not assessed sufficient structural weakness in the energy sector's thesis to convince me to change my bullish assessment of its growth prospects,” they said in the report. The author has maintained a “Buy” rating for the fund.

The information technology sector, which consists of stocks including Nvidia (NVDA), First Solar (FSLR), and Apple (AAPL) led the pack among the S&P500 sectors with the highest second-quarter growth.

The sector was the highest performer in the S&P 500 Index, rising 8.38%, followed by Utilities (XLU) and Communications (XLC) both outperforming the benchmark index during the quarter too.

Nvidia (NVDA) saw the biggest growth in the S&P 500 IT index, rising nearly 36.73% during the quarter, having the lead among chipmakers in supplying the necessary units for the AI boom.

First Solar (FSLR) came in a close second, rising 33.57%, benefiting from the AI frenzy, as the demand for cheap energy increased. Sales and profit of its energy panels rose well past analyst estimates in its previous quarter results.

Investors were enthusiastic as Nvidia and Apple posted results that topped Wall Street estimates, piggybacking on the AI craze for data centers and servers. Apple also launched its $110 billion buyback program, raising its quarterly dividend to $0.25 per share.

Apple (AAPL) gained 9.40% so far this year.

Industries Second-Quarter Performance

Software & Services rose 3.4% during the second quarter. Technology, Hardware, and Equipment rose 20.22% and Semiconductors & Semiconductor Equipment rose 21.31%.

U.S. stock fund flow in and out of the sector, while average on a whole throughout the second quarter, rose and fell significantly during a week in June. The information technology sector-focused ETF (XLK) had a net outflow of $210.21 million as of June 27.

What Quantitative Measures say?

XLK received a Strong Buy rating from Seeking Alpha's Quant Rating system, with a score of 4.62 out of 5. The sector got an A+ for liquidity and momentum, an A for expenses, and a B for dividends. However, it was given a C- in the prospect of risk.

What do analysts expect?

Three analysts surveyed by Seeking Alpha in the last 90 days gave the sector a Buy. Another three recommended a Hold, with one recommending a Sell and the remaining one recommending a Strong Sell.

Seeking Alpha analyst Komal Sarwar wrote that investing in tech ETFs could offer exposure to the tech sector while lowering risks associated with single-stock investments.

However, another report by analyst Vladimir Dimitrov said that due to its weighting methodology, the ETF is extremely concentrated and NVDA is the sole reason why the XLK outperformed the broader technology sector.

""Extreme concentration within the ETF is making it less likely that it will continue to outperform more diversified alternatives,"" he added.","The Technology Select Sector SPDR Fund ETF (NYSEARCA:XLK), which tracks S&P 500's information technology sector, gained 8.38% so far this quarter, outperforming the 4.56% rise in the broader S&P500 Index.

The fund saw a pullback in April as market participants significantly dialed back their interest rate cut expectations amid a hawkish Fedspeak, with XLRE retreating by 8.63% for the month.

The next two months were relieving, but not enough to square up the April losses. The index increased by 5.17% in May and 0.76% in June, after the incoming economic data reignited rate cut hopes.

XLRE saw inflows worth $69.01M in Q2, compared to $484.73M a quarter ago.

Real estate services company CoStar Group (CSGP) was the biggest loser, declining 23.25% from Q1-end. Meanwhile, health care REIT Ventas (VTR) stood out as the winner, advancing 17.73%.

Subsector Performance

Real Estate Management & Development dropped the most among subsectors, declining 16.98% from the previous quarter. Industrial REITs followed, losing 13.76% of value.

Health care REITs and residential REITs were the winners, increasing by 11.37% and 8.75%, respectively.

What Analysts Expect

""There are opportunity and growth potential within the REIT sector. Office and apartment space remains the largest player, and there have been some serious issues there. However, areas like healthcare, industrial, multifamily and data centers are seeing meaningful growth,"" said Seeking Alpha author Sungarden Investment Publishing.

""While I do see potential for rates to come down, I am less confident they will stay down. Alternatively, they may continue to fall, but for the ""wrong reasons"" due to a recession. If that is the root cause of the decline in rates, equities don't look as good in general,"" the author said, upgrading XLRE to Hold from Sell.

""XLRE is a core fund for investors looking for exposure to real estate companies. XLRE focuses primarily on equity REITs, adding exposure to smaller real estate-related companies to complement the portfolio,"" said SA contributor REITer's Digest with a Buy rating on the ETF.

On average, SA analysts rate the fund as Buy.

The revision comes as investors “appear to have concerns” about makers of jet engines, especially after aviation giant Airbus (OTCPK:EADSY) (OTCPK:EADSF) cut its target for plane deliveries to 770 from 800 previously for the year, according to Wells Fargo. RTX (RTX) generates more profit from original equipment than engine makers such as GE Aerospace (GE) does, because Collins Aerospace makes avionics, power systems and interiors for planes.

“The impact from 30 fewer Airbus deliveries (about 4%) is still fairly small,” Matthew Akers, analyst at Wells Fargo, said in a June 28 report. “We trim our 2024 sales forecast by approximately 2% at Collins, with EPS coming down by about $0.05 for the year.”

RTX (RTX) is likely to report results for the second quarter on July 23, according to an estimate from Zacks Investment Research. It will be RTX’s (RTX) first earnings report from Chief Executive Chris Calio, who succeeded former company head Gregory Hayes on May 2.

“Another common investor concern we hear is that RTX (RTX) could revise down its 2025 guidance with second-quarter results,” according to Wells Fargo. “The second quarter will be the first opportunity for Chris to put his own stamp on the long-term outlook.”

Wells Fargo raised its price target on RTX (RTX) to $141 a share from $139 a share previously, based on a multiple of 26 times 2026 results.

In the same report, Wells Fargo raised its 2024 earnings estimate for GE Aerospace (GE).","RTX (NYSE:RTX) this year is likely to be less profitable than previously estimated, analysts at financial-services firm Wells Fargo said in revising their forecast for the aerospace and defense company, whose operations include Collins Aerospace and jet-engine maker Pratt & Whitney.

Growing up in Guatemala, Ruth Monrroy often spent time at her mother’s restaurant watching in awe of how she connected with customers.

“I knew I wanted to have my own business,” Mrs. Monrroy said on a recent weekday afternoon on Hollywood Boulevard, where her childhood wish has come true.

Mrs. Monrroy, 44, parks her metal cart in front of the TCL Chinese Theater six days a week, selling items including fruit salad, hot dogs and energy drinks.

“Mango, water, soda, Gatorade, hot dog!” she calls out to the crowds traipsing over Hollywood Walk of Fame stars dedicated to Bruce Willis and Billy Crystal.

Street vending is a quintessential California job — from the pickup trucks selling cartons of strawberries next to fields near Fresno to the pop-up stands offering carne asada tacos along Oakland thoroughfares. In Los Angeles alone, an estimated 10,000 street vendors sell food.

Until recently, vendors along Hollywood Boulevard were operating outside the law. And while that legal cloud has lifted, eking out a living remains a challenge. Cost-conscious tourists sometimes scoff at the prices, even if sellers struggle to break even. And while longtime street vendors respect and recognize the turf of other regulars, there are more sellers working in the area, and competition has increased.","“I knew I wanted to have my own business,” Mrs. Monrroy said on a recent weekday afternoon on Hollywood Boulevard, where her childhood wish has come true.

The Personal Consumption Expenditures index climbed 2.6 percent in May from a year earlier, matching what economists had forecast and down from 2.7 percent previously.

After stripping out volatile food and fuel prices to give a better sense of the inflation trend, a “core” price measure was also up 2.6 percent from a year earlier, down from 2.8 percent in the April reading. And on a monthly basis, inflation was especially mild, and prices did not climb on an overall basis.

The Fed is likely to watch the fresh inflation data closely as central bankers think about their next policy steps. Officials raised interest rates sharply starting in 2022 to hit the brakes on consumer and business demand, which in turn can help to slow price increases. But they have held borrowing costs steady at 5.3 percent since July as inflation has slowly come down, and have been contemplating when to begin lowering interest rates.","The Federal Reserve’s preferred inflation measure continued to cool as consumer spending grew only moderately, good news for central bankers who have been trying to weigh down demand and wrestle price increases under control.

Trump took to social media to share one of his central economic philosophies: “Trade wars are good, and easy to win.”

As president, Mr. Trump presided over the biggest increase in U.S. tariffs since the Great Depression, hitting China, Canada, the European Union, Mexico, India and other governments with stiff levies. They hit back, imposing tariffs on American soybeans, whiskey, orange juice and motorcycles. U.S. agricultural exports plummeted, prompting Mr. Trump to send $23 billion to farmers to help offset losses.

Now, as he runs for president again, Mr. Trump is promising to ratchet up his trade war to a much greater degree. He has proposed “universal baseline tariffs on most foreign products,” including higher levies on certain countries that devalue their currency. In interviews, he has floated plans for a 10 percent tariff on most imports and a tariff of 60 percent or more on Chinese goods. He has also posited cutting the federal income tax and relying on tariffs for revenue instead.

Mr. Trump, who once proclaimed himself “Tariff Man,” has long argued that tariffs would boost American factories, end the gap between what America imported and what it exported and increase American jobs.","They hit back, imposing tariffs on American soybeans, whiskey, orange juice and motorcycles.

The executives at the Business Roundtable, a group representing some of the country’s biggest corporations, objected to Mr. Biden’s proposals to raise taxes. They questioned the lack of business representation in the Cabinet. They bristled at what they called overregulation by federal agencies.

While the meeting was not antagonistic, it was indicative of three and a half years of executive grousing about Mr. Biden. Business leaders have criticized his remarks on “corporate greed” and his appearance on a union picket line. They chafe at the actions of officials he has appointed — particularly the head of the Federal Trade Commission, Lina Khan, who has moved to block a series of corporate mergers.

A number of prominent figures in Silicon Valley and on Wall Street — including the venture capitalists David Sacks and Marc Andreessen, and the hedge fund magnate Kenneth Griffin — have grown increasingly vocal in their criticism of Mr. Biden, their praise of former President Donald J.

The waiting room has books by America’s youth poet laureate Amanda Gorman and its Instagram poet laureate Rupi Kaur. The kitchen is stocked with Spindrift. A conference room also serves as a venue for “shots nights,” less raucous than they sound, where patients inject themselves with fertility drugs communally, with encouragement from staff.

Spring’s medical director in New York, Catha Fischer, dressed in a loose blouse and a low ponytail, beamed as she showed me the phlebotomy stations and operating room, where patients are anesthetized so that a doctor can puncture their ovaries with a needle and suck out eggs for freezing. The room, Dr. Fischer noted, “looks like a Grey’s Anatomy O.R.”

There is always a market for products, from skin care to weight loss, promising to ease the angst of womanhood. Efforts to slow down the reproductive clock are no different. The business of egg extraction is thriving, among the privileged group of people who can access it.","Spring Fertility, a clinic in Midtown Manhattan, looks like the place where the main characters on “Broad City” would have wound up if the millennial sitcom had done an episode about egg freezing.

She spent summers getting ready to show cattle at the county fair. During the school year, she rushed home after class to feed the chickens on her family’s corn and soybean farm. Neither of her parents went to college, but they encouraged their daughter when she decided to go to Carleton, a liberal arts school a two-hour drive from their farm in Minnesota.

Despite being physically close to home, Ms. Lunz Trujillo was surprised by how foreign her upbringing seemed at the college. She was dismayed when she checked out the farm club and learned that its members wanted to brew kombucha, not milk cows. When an art history teacher asked students which famous paintings they’d seen in person, Ms. Lunz Trujillo stayed quiet, because she had never been to an art museum. This sense of cultural alienation molded her research when she became a political scientist: What is rural identity? How does it shape a person’s politics?

This year, Ms. Lunz Trujillo, now an assistant professor at the University of South Carolina, was reading a new, best-selling book that cited her research to explore those same questions. But this recognition didn’t bring the thrill she might have expected.","Kristin Lunz Trujillo grew up proud of her family’s way of life.

So Detroit Is Making Changes.,"In January 2020, Robert Williams spent 30 hours in a Detroit jail because facial recognition technology suggested he was a criminal. The match was wrong, and Mr. Williams sued.

On Friday, as part of a legal settlement over his wrongful arrest, Mr. Williams got a commitment from the Detroit Police Department to do better. The city adopted new rules for police use of facial recognition technology that the American Civil Liberties Union, which represented Mr. Williams, says should be the new national standard.

“We hope that it moves the needle in the right direction,” Mr. Williams said.

Mr. Williams was the first person known to be wrongfully arrested based on faulty facial recognition. But he wasn’t the last. The Detroit police arrested at least two other people as a result of facial recognition searches gone awry, including a woman who was charged with carjacking when she was eight months pregnant.

Law enforcement agencies across the country use facial recognition technology to try to identify criminals whose misdeeds are caught on camera. In Michigan, the software compares an unknown face to those in a database of mug shots or drivers’ license photos. In other jurisdictions, the police use tools, like Clearview AI, that search through photos scraped from social media sites and the public internet.","In January 2020, Robert Williams spent 30 hours in a Detroit jail because facial recognition technology suggested he was a criminal.

Ms. Kaplan was already famous when she founded her law firm in 2017, having won a landmark Supreme Court case that paved the way for marriage equality for gay Americans.

But those triumphs couldn’t overcome an uncomfortable reality, according to people familiar with the law firm’s internal dynamics.

In the eyes of many of her colleagues, including the firm’s two other named partners, Ms. Kaplan’s poor treatment of other lawyers — ranging from micromanagement to vulgar insults and humiliating personal attacks — was impairing the boutique firm she had built, the people said. For one thing, they said, she was jeopardizing its ability to recruit and retain valuable employees.","Last fall, senior partners at Kaplan Hecker & Fink, a New York law firm known for championing liberal causes, made a fateful decision: They were going to sideline their hard-charging and crusading founder, Roberta A.

We don’t yet have “Madoff: The Musical,” but years after his 2021 death from kidney disease in a federal prison hospital, Bernie the Ponzi-scheming potentate keeps yielding cultural dividends. An experimental film shown at Lincoln Center. A Netflix documentary series, “The Monster of Wall Street.” And now, adding to a fat stack that includes a coloring book and an exposé by a New York Times reporter that generated its own Robert De Niro movie, a new prose probe entitled “Madoff: The Final Word.”

Final? As its own author, Richard Behar, admits: doubtful.

A longtime investigative journalist who has taken on, among other formidable institutions, the litigious Church of Scientology, Behar spent 15 years seemingly half-shackled to and half-tickled by this, his first book. Along with many, many secondary interviews, he visited Madoff in prison thrice; talked to him on the phone about 50 times; and received from him dozens of handwritten letters and hundreds of emails.(He’s far from the first or only reporter to have visited the man in the clink, but the passage of time has loosened some auxiliary tongues — though death has stilled others.)

For every dollar he stole, Madoff seems to have generated at least one piece of regular paper. The hoard of 30 million documents he didn’t manage to destroy, Behar writes, “is nearly half the size of the printed material collection of the U.S. Library of Congress.” The shredding operation Madoff ran starting in the mid-90s, in a Brooklyn facility now called Tuck-It-Away, was like an A.S.M.R. orgy: burlap bags of the scraps taken to a nearby recycling plant, his secrets “dissolving to mulch.”","MADOFF: The Final Word, by Richard BeharWe don’t yet have “Madoff: The Musical,” but years after his 2021 death from kidney disease in a federal prison hospital, Bernie the Ponzi-scheming potentate keeps yielding cultural dividends.

Still, it was hard to ignore his pitch. Three days earlier, we had received an email promising a “previously unseen classified video” with “dramatic proof and new facts.”

Trump.

The prime-time bout, organized by CNN and simulcast on more than a dozen networks, was easily the most-viewed moment of the 2024 presidential campaign, the sort of mass civic gathering that is increasingly rare in a choose-your-own-news era of media. And the figure released on Friday by Nielsen, which mostly measures traditional TV sets, did not include the likely millions more who watched on digital news sites and social media platforms.

The size of the TV audience — similar to that for an N.F.L. conference championship game — could be grim news for the Biden campaign, given the shaky and stumbling performance by the president, which set off panic in the upper echelons of the Democratic Party.

But viewership was also down 30 percent from the first Biden-Trump debate in September 2020, which notched more than 73 million viewers. Nielsen said Thursday’s matchup in Atlanta was the lowest-rated general-election debate since the final meeting of George W. Bush and John Kerry in 2004.","The numbers are in: 51.3 million Americans tuned in live to watch Thursday night’s televised debate between President Biden and former President Donald J. Trump.

The deal will help Rivian, which has never turned a quarterly profit, make more electric vehicles and help convince investors of its stability. It will provide Volkswagen with the software expertise that auto analysts say it sorely lacks.

People worried about bills, feeling overwhelmed about overspending or concerned about money management may expect a “money talk” to lead to an argument, so they avoid bringing up the topic, according to a report from researchers at Cornell University and Yale University, published this month in The Journal of Consumer Psychology. Yet prior research has found that communicating about money helps couples spend more responsibly and better manage their debt.

“They anticipate conflict, so they’re choosing not to have these conversations at all,” said Emily Garbinsky, associate professor of marketing and management communication at Cornell’s business school and one of the study’s authors.

Why is it so difficult for some people to talk about money with their partners in the first place?

The company, which is based in Osaka, had not provided new information on deaths potentially linked to CholesteHelp since March.

Since then, Kobayashi Pharmaceutical has received reports that 1,656 people sought medical advice for CholesteHelp-related health concerns, and 289 people have been hospitalized, the company reported.

Despite all the CNN logos filling viewers’ screens, and the nonstop hype that the network had piled onto Thursday’s prime time debate between President Biden and former President Donald J. Trump, the anchors Jake Tapper and Dana Bash mostly receded into the background as they moderated.

There were virtually no real-time fact-checks of Mr. Trump’s numerous baseless assertions. At tense moments, the moderators deferred to the candidates to directly address each other’s claims. And the concerns that Mr. Trump might pick a showstopping fight with his CNN interlocutors proved unfounded.

Mr. Tapper’s name was mentioned only twice in the course of 90 minutes. Ms. Bash’s name was not uttered once.

CNN had made clear ahead of time that its moderators would act as facilitators, not participants. Its chairman, Mark Thompson, called Mr. Biden and Mr. Trump “the stars of the show.” On that front, the network succeeded.","Despite all the CNN logos filling viewers’ screens, and the nonstop hype that the network had piled onto Thursday’s prime time debate between President Biden and former President Donald J.

The verdict, which capped a monthlong class-action trial and almost a decade of legal wrangling, includes about $96 million in damages for the bars and restaurants that subscribed to the service, and more than $4.6 billion for roughly 2.4 million residential subscribers. Damages in antitrust cases like this are tripled by law, which means the league may have to pay more than $14 billion.

The jury’s damages were most of what the plaintiffs lawyers were seeking. “It’s a great day for consumers everywhere,” said Bill Carmody, one of the plaintiffs’ lawyers.

The N.F.L. is expected to appeal the verdict.

“We are disappointed with the jury’s verdict today in the N.F.L.

He was 77.

The cause was cancer, said Brad Turell, a family spokesman.

Mr. Kellner was one of the most successful television executives of his generation, whose knack for capturing young viewers — first men at Fox, then women at WB — lured viewers away from the Big Three networks that had ruled television for nearly 40 years.

Mr. Kellner believed ABC, NBC and CBS were ignoring viewers under 35 and were hamstrung by middle-of-the-road taste. Rupert Murdoch, Fox Inc.’s owner, and Barry Diller, its chairman, recruited Mr. Kellner from the television syndication business in 1986 and installed him as president of the Fox Broadcasting Company.

Its aspiration to be the first new TV network since ABC in 1948 was broadly derided. But from the debut in 1987 of its first series, the lowbrow family sitcom “Married … With Children,” which was shown on six Murdoch-owned stations and a string of independent ones that Mr. Kellner helped stitch together, the new network began stealing the Big Three’s audience.","Jamie Kellner, a media executive who helped build Fox Broadcasting into a thriving television network with shows such as “Beverly Hills, 90210” and “The Simpsons” — and who went on to create the WB network, known for the angsty “Dawson’s Creek” and “Buffy the Vampire Slayer” — died on June 21 at his home in Montecito, Calif., near Santa Barbara.

The truth is that they spend most of their time trying to minimize risk.

It’s why theaters are clogged with vacuous sequels. It’s why so many Hollywood power players hide behind P.R. people. And it’s why all of the big movie studios and streaming services — and, in fact, most indie film companies — declined to distribute “The Apprentice,” a dramatized origin story about Donald J. Trump that the former president has called “malicious defamation” and showered with cease-and-desist letters.

But the movie business still has at least one wildcatter: Tom Ortenberg.

Mr. Ortenberg, 63, and his Briarcliff Entertainment are pushing to complete a deal to acquire “The Apprentice” for wide release in theaters in the United States in September or early October — close enough to the presidential election to bask in its heat, but far enough away to avoid final-stretch media overload. Briarcliff’s pursuit of the $16 million film was confirmed by five people involved with the sale process, who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss a private negotiation.

“Tom’s got more courage than most people in Hollywood combined,” said Stephen Galloway, the dean of Chapman University’s film school. “His interest in this kind of movie involves business, of course. He sees money to be made by leveraging millions of dollars in free publicity. But part of it is wanting to do his bit. He’s liberal and cares about social issues.”","The truth is that they spend most of their time trying to minimize risk.

Founded in 1979 and distinguished by its commitment to presenting work by living American writers, Second Stage said that its board had chosen Evan Cabnet as its next artistic director. Cabnet is currently the artistic director of LCT3, Lincoln Center Theater’s program for emerging writers, directors and designers. Cabnet will succeed Carole Rothman, one of the theater’s founders, who led the organization for 45 years and is stepping down in August.

Second Stage has a proud history of presenting acclaimed work, including the Pulitzer-winning shows “Between Riverside and Crazy,” “Water by the Spoonful” and “Next to Normal.” Its plays and musicals have won multiple other honors; most recently, the organization’s production of “Appropriate” won this year’s Tony Award for best play revival.

Second Stage owns Broadway’s smallest house, the 600-seat Hayes Theater. Like many nonprofit theaters, Second Stage has reduced its footprint since the pandemic — it let go of its Off Off Broadway space on the Upper West Side, and at the end of this year is letting go of its Off Broadway venue in Times Square, although it plans to continue to produce such work in other spaces, starting next spring at the Pershing Square Signature Center. The organization currently has 47 staffers and an annual budget of $27 million; this season it is planning to stage two Broadway shows, two Off Broadway shows and a Next Stage Festival for early-career work.","Second Stage Theater, one of the four nonprofit organizations with Broadway houses, on Thursday named a new artistic director as the sector braces for a wave of leadership turnover.

In a 5-to-4 decision, the justices found that the deal, carefully negotiated over years with states, tribes, local governments and individuals, had broken a basic tenet of bankruptcy law by shielding members of the Sackler family from lawsuits without the consent of those who might sue.

The plan for Purdue Pharma, the maker of the prescription painkiller OxyContin, the drug widely considered to have ignited the crisis, was unusual because it offered broad protections that the Sackler family, who controlled the company, had demanded for years even as the Sacklers avoided declaring bankruptcy themselves.

“The Sacklers have not filed for bankruptcy and have not placed virtually all their assets on the table for distribution to creditors, yet they seek what essentially amounts to a discharge,” Justice Neil M.

Alito Jr., Amy Coney Barrett and Ketanji Brown Jackson.","The Supreme Court said on Thursday that members of the Sackler family cannot be shielded from liability for civil claims related to the opioid epidemic, jeopardizing a bankruptcy plan that would have offered such protection in exchange for channeling billions of dollars toward addressing the crisis.
In a 5-to-4 decision, the justices found that the deal, carefully negotiated over years with states, tribes, local governments and individuals, had broken a basic tenet of bankruptcy law by shielding members of the Sackler family from lawsuits without the consent of those who might sue.
The plan for Purdue Pharma, the maker of the prescription painkiller OxyContin, the drug widely considered to have ignited the crisis, was unusual because it offered broad protections that the Sackler family, who controlled the company, had demanded for years even as the Sacklers avoided declaring bankruptcy themselves.

New York Times,https://www.nytimes.com/2024/06/27/business/dealbook/biden-trump-debate-cheat-sheet.html,2024-06-27,11:56:45 UTC,A Debate Cheat Sheet for Business,"Talking points

All eyes will be on CNN at 9 p.m. Eastern, when President Biden and Donald Trump face off in their first debate since 2020. Among the keenest watchers will be executives and investors looking for signs about how the candidates might handle the economy and business in a second term.

There will be plenty to scrutinize in the 90-minute, audience-free debate, including what the candidates say and how they say it. Here’s what we will be looking out for. (And, for a lighter take, check out our debate “bingo card” further below.)

The economy is the big question. Various measures show strong growth under Biden, but many voters feel differently. What will Biden and Trump say about some of the key issues?

Inflation: This is clearly a challenge for the president, as Americans complain about what they’re paying in the grocery store, at the pump and on their rent. Biden can say that price increases are slowing down, and will most likely emphasize his administration’s efforts to crack down on “corporate greed,” like taking on so-called junk fees. Trump will probably stress how good things were when he took office in 2017 — an economy many Americans want back.

Taxes: Biden’s proposals for higher corporate taxes will hit profits: “It’s simple math,” David Bahnsen, the founder and chief investment officer of the Bahnsen Group, told DealBook. Many business leaders don’t like Biden’s plan to increase taxes on the wealthy, either. Trump will probably stress his desire to extend his 2017 tax cuts and lower the corporate rate to 20 percent. But questions about corporate earnings and the economy may eclipse those concerns.

Protectionism: Both candidates want to increase tariffs on Chinese goods, but Biden has been more targeted in how he has done it during his presidency. Trump has proposed significantly higher across-the-board levies, though it’s unclear how serious he is about it. Economists have warned that Trump’s potential approach could aggravate inflation and hurt the economy.

Markets: The S&P 500 set 31 records this year; investors will hope neither party messes with that momentum. In Thursday night’s debate, “markets probably care more about presentation than policy pledges,” Paul Donovan, an economist at UBS, wrote in a client note. Biden may have a slight edge, he added, since investors would prefer keeping “some continuity.”

Other issues will probably feature prominently. Biden will most likely raise abortion rights, a topic that has helped Democrats win in recent elections. Trump will almost certainly speak a lot about immigration, perhaps his most potent issue — and one that many, including Elon Musk, say is a failure of Biden’s.

The intangibles will matter. Executives told DealBook that C.E.O.s will be paying attention to how Biden and Trump perform:

For Biden, 81, an important issue for business leaders and many voters is whether he is still fit to serve. A sharp, forceful performance could go a ways in quieting any concerns.

For Trump, 78, competence is a question as well. But his demeanor will also be under scrutiny, especially if he comes across as overly abrasive or erratic. Some executives said their feelings would come down to whether they can stomach another four years of a Trump presidency.

There’s also the show around the show. Trump has suggested that his potential running mate would be in Atlanta for the debate. The Times reports that his list is narrowing, with Senator J.D. Vance of Ohio, Gov. Doug Burgum of North Dakota and Senator Marco Rubio of Florida being of particular interest.","Talking pointsAll eyes will be on CNN at 9 p.m. Eastern, when President Biden and Donald Trump face off in their first debate since 2020.

Addressing reporters at a company factory in Renton, Wash., Elizabeth Lund, a Boeing executive, provided new details on Tuesday about how the plane involved in the incident left the plant apparently without four critical bolts that secured the panel, known as a door plug, in place.

Boeing said the information was not for release until Thursday morning, under a common kind of agreement that allowed the attending reporters time to process the detailed briefing.

But the National Transportation Safety Board became aware of the remarks at the briefing and rebuked the company hours before articles on the remarks were published. It said that Boeing improperly shared investigative information and speculated about the cause of the incident, adding that the company had “blatantly violated” the agency’s rules surrounding active investigations. The agency said it would provide details about that violation to the Justice Department, which is investigating the January flight.","Boeing drew fresh criticism from a federal regulator on Thursday over disclosures about the continuing investigation into a harrowing January flight during which one of the company’s 737 Max planes lost a panel, exposing passengers to howling winds at an altitude of about 16,000 feet.

New York Times,https://www.nytimes.com/2024/06/27/travel/qatar-airlines-international-documentation.html,2024-06-27,09:01:57 UTC,Help! Qatar Airways Denied Us Boarding Because of a Broken Link.,"Dear Tripped Up,

I am a single American mother living in Jordan and working for the United Nations. In September 2019, I adopted my then 5-year-old son from China, and promised him we would return to visit his country every year. But the pandemic broke out. When China finally reopened to tourists in 2023, we got visas and booked a July flight to Beijing via Doha on Qatar Airways, paying about $1,400 total. My now 9-year-old had worked hard to maintain his language and was excited, but nervous. At that time, the Chinese government required passengers to fill out a “Health Declaration Form” in advance or upon arrival. The link on the Qatar Airways website was broken, but I confirmed online and with friends who had recently traveled to China that I could fill it out upon arrival. At the airport, Qatar Airways disagreed, and when I once again couldn’t get the form to work, we were denied boarding. My son collapsed on the airport floor, sobbing. I rebooked for the next day, and we flew to Beijing via Istanbul on Royal Jordanian and China Southern for $1,882. Neither airline requested to see the QR code showing my form had been approved: All passengers upon arrival were made to fill out new forms. Qatar Airways mostly refunded the tickets — we received $1,185 — but refused to admit it was wrong. Considering the more expensive last-minute flight and other costs (such as rebooking domestic flights and trains in China) we are out about $930. I believe the airline should provide a flight voucher that compensates us for that amount. Can you help? Elizabeth, Amman, Jordan

Dear Elizabeth,

Your run-in with the complex world of international travel documentation was especially devastating because of the emotional stakes this trip represented for your family. But confusion over documentation leads to denied boarding “thousands of times a day,” said Max Tremaine, the chief executive of Sherpa, a company that maintains a database of international entrance requirements for travelers.

Not to excuse Qatar Airways for what I will charitably call a vigorous over-enforcement of the rules, but those frontline airline workers facing long lines at check-in can have a difficult task, making snap judgments on whether travelers have sufficient documents or not.

Countries all have their own entry rules depending on the passports that travelers hold and where they are coming from, and airlines are fined when they mistakenly allow people to fly. The decision may be straightforward when their customers are an American family with valid passports headed direct from New York to London for a week’s vacation. But travel can be complicated — consider, say, when a Dutch banker is on his way to Bangladesh via Cairo or an Australian trapeze artist with a one-way ticket heads to a performance in Kyrgyzstan through Frankfurt.The pandemic only complicated this complicated system. In your situation, your itinerary had you going through Qatar Airways’ hub in Doha, meaning those behind you in line in Jordan were probably headed to dozens of countries, all with their own rules.","When China finally reopened to tourists in 2023, we got visas and booked a July flight to Beijing via Doha on Qatar Airways, paying about $1,400 total.

This year, highlights from the Summer Olympics will be brought to you by artificial intelligence — and more specifically, the A.I.-generated narration of Al Michaels.

Executives at NBCUniversal and the streaming service Peacock said on Wednesday that a customized, daily highlight reel for the Olympics would be available to streaming subscribers. The reel will feature the voice of Mr. Michaels, the 79-year-old American broadcaster, who first covered the Olympics decades ago.

Mr. Michaels, however, will not be holing up in a broadcast booth each night to briefly summarize the dozens of Olympic events that took place. Instead, Peacock’s program has been trained from Mr. Michaels’s NBC clips — he joined the network in 2006 and was its longtime “Sunday Night Football” announcer — to formulate coherent, realistic-sounding sentences, which “will provide his signature expertise and elocution,” the company said.

Mr. Michaels granted approval for the use of his voice.

“When I was approached about this, I was skeptical but obviously curious,” Mr. Michaels said in a statement issued by the company. “Then I saw a demonstration detailing what they had in mind. I said, ‘I’m in.’”","This year, highlights from the Summer Olympics will be brought to you by artificial intelligence — and more specifically, the A.I.-generated narration of Al Michaels.

The preliminary injunctions, which suspend parts of the program known as SAVE, leave millions of borrowers in limbo until lawsuits filed by two groups of Republican-led states challenging the legality of the plan are decided.

That means the Biden administration cannot reduce borrowers’ monthly bills by as much as half starting July 1, as had been scheduled, and it must pause debt forgiveness to SAVE enrollees. The administration has canceled $5.5 billion in debt for more than 414,000 borrowers through the plan, which opened in August.

So Why Are a Quarter of Women Still Paying for It?,"Last week, Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont, chair of the Senate health committee, called on a government watchdog to investigate why insurance companies are still charging women for birth control — a move that thrust access to contraceptives back into the spotlight.

In a letter to the Government Accountability Office, the senator noted that insurance companies were charging Americans for contraceptives that, under federal law, should be free — and that they were also denying appeals from consumers who were seeking to have their contraceptives covered. Some experts estimate that those practices could affect access to birth control for millions of women.

Since 2012, the Affordable Care Act has mandated that private insurance plans cover the “full range” of contraceptives for women approved by the Food and Drug Administration, including female sterilizations, emergency contraceptives and any new products cleared by the F.D.A. The mandate also covers services associated with contraceptives, like counseling, insertions or removals and follow-up care.

That means that consumers shouldn’t have any associated co-payments with in-network providers, even if they haven’t met their deductibles. Some plans might cover only generic versions of certain contraceptives, but patients are still entitled to coverage of a specific product that their providers deem medically necessary. Medicaid plans have a similar provision; the only exception to the mandate are plans sponsored by employers or colleges that have religious or moral objections.","Some experts estimate that those practices could affect access to birth control for millions of women.

The underlying cause, though, are the billions of dollars their government owes its creditors.

Kenya has the fastest growing economy in Africa and a vibrant business center. But its government is desperate to stave off default. The country’s staggering $80 billion in domestic and foreign public debt accounts for nearly three-quarters of Kenya’s entire economic output, according to a recent report from the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development. Interest payments alone are eating up 27 percent of the revenue collected.

The Kenyan president, William Ruto, had promoted the tax bill as necessary to avoid defaulting on the country’s debt, but the violent reaction to Parliament’s approval prompted Mr. Ruto to abruptly reverse course on Wednesday and reject the legislation he had asked for. “Listening keenly to the people of Kenya,” he said, “I will not sign the 2024 finance bill, and it shall subsequently be withdrawn.” He proposed a 14-day period of discussions to chart a new economic course.

Mr. Ruto’s turnaround may have temporarily quieted protests, but it leaves the country’s finances more precarious than before. Just two weeks ago, the International Monetary Fund and Kenyan authorities had reached an agreement on a package of comprehensive reforms and tax increases needed to get the country on a more stable financial footing.","The immediate trigger for the raging protest that gripped Kenya’s capital on Tuesday was a raft of proposed tax increases — additional shillings that ordinary citizens would owe their government.

Three years ago, corporate leaders openly spoke out against Donald Trump over his role in the Jan. 6, 2021, Capitol attack. But as the former president leads in many polls this time around, most in the C-suite are staying quiet.

In 2021, C.E.O.s including Mary Barra of General Motors and Doug McMillon of Walmart publicly urged a peaceful transition of power. This time, leaders have largely stayed out of the political fray. Only a handful of executives have publicly supported Trump, who was willing to go after perceived enemies in corporate American when he was in office. And while there may be support for President Biden behind the scenes, few have offered it on the record.

What’s behind the silence?

A return to the norm: Executives have mentioned election-related topics 364 times in earning calls in the second quarter as of June 24, according to the data provider AlphaSense. It’s highly unlikely that tally will reach 902, the number of times the topics were mentioned in 2020 during the same period.","Quiet in the C-suiteThree years ago, corporate leaders openly spoke out against Donald Trump over his role in the Jan. 6, 2021, Capitol attack.

In contrast to the many lakes where my brother and I would swim or skate, attend Scout camps or sprawl out for family picnics, the hushed and shaded Housatonic seemed unfamiliar and at times downright eerie. Notions of Edenic riverbanks came from my mom reading “The Wind in the Willows” out loud after dinner — not from encounters with the actual river that flowed 330 yards from our front door.

Later, I came to associate the Housatonic with sorrow. An arched bridge over it, which I crossed on my walk to high school, marked the transition from home to the stresses of my teenage years. I learned, too, that reaches of the river acclaimed by Melville, Ives and Longfellow were laden with PCBs, an industrial pollutant.

Tourists, taking their cue from locals, have only rarely ventured down to the Housatonic’s banks. But in recent years, the river’s cleanup (the next stages of which remain a source of fierce community debate) has reminded everyone who loves the Berkshires that the Housatonic needs our attention and — whether from a canoe or a riverside trail — abundantly rewards our affection.","For much of my childhood in the Berkshires region of western Massachusetts, I didn’t give a hoot about the Housatonic River.

Move over, J.P. Morgan — we have a new contender for most apocalyptic stock-market forecast.

It comes courtesy of Peter Berezin, chief global strategist at BCA Research, who said in a report shared with MarketWatch on Thursday that he has revised down his target for the S&P 500 SPX to 3,750 — lower than J.P. Morgan Global Research’s year-end target of 4,200, the previous Wall Street low — due to expectations that the U.S. will soon enter a sudden and unexpected recession. Berezin expects that recession to begin either later this year or in early 2025.

Most Read from MarketWatch

Should that transpire, the S&P 500 could decline more than 30% from Friday’s levels as a result, according to his forecast.

Potentially making matters worse for markets, Berezin expects the economic pain will be widespread. He expects growth in Europe — which is only just starting to pick up — to slow. And China, which is still struggling in the aftermath of the collapse of a real-estate bubble, could also succumb.

The upshot is that, in this scenario, global growth would weaken at large, weighing on global stocks.

As far as the U.S. is concerned, Berezin’s thesis is rooted in the notion that a slowdown in the labor market is poised to accelerate rapidly — heaping enormous pressure on consumer spending, a key economic driver.

He rattled off a number of indicators suggesting that the torrid pace of pandemic-era hiring has given way to something far less appealing to workers. As official job-openings data show, the number of open positions have fallen substantially, as has the quit rate. And private surveys of job openings reflect an even more dramatic decline.

At the same time, Labor Department data show that the pace of wage growth has slowed.

There have also been signs that consumer spending has been slowing in recently released economic data, including Friday’s personal-consumption expenditures price index for May.

Story continues

But Berezin believes this could be only the beginning, as a suddenly enfeebled labor market may kick off a vicious cycle.

Data on bank balances already show that lower-income Americans appear to have depleted their pandemic-era savings. As delinquency rates for credit cards and auto loans — already at levels unseen since 2010 — continue to climb, banks could opt to raise their lending standards, adding to pressures facing the consumer.

As the consumer slows, Berezin expects businesses could slow their spending on capital projects.

Indeed, data collected by BCA that tracks businesses’ spending plans show that many are already preparing to cut back on capital expenditures, or “capex,” despite the artificial-intelligence boom, the CHIPS Act and ongoing reshoring trends that Wall Street believes should boost this type of spending.

Once the recession envisioned by Berezin arrives, the Federal Reserve likely won’t swoop in to stop it — at least not right away. Fear of reigniting a second wave of inflation likely means Fed Chair Jerome Powell and his colleagues would be reluctant to act until it is already too late.

And fiscal policy likely won’t be much help, either. The budget deficit is already projected to grow to 7% of GDP in 2024, according to official Congressional Budget Office estimates. Right now, the U.S. is in dire need of fiscal discipline, not an increase in deficit spending.

As a result, regardless of who wins in November, the bond market would likely rebel against any attempts to increase unfunded spending.

BCA recommended that clients reduce their equity holdings while boosting their allocations to bonds and cash earlier this week.

But for those more inclined toward tactical trades, Berezin recommended a few, including shorting the price of bitcoin BTCUSD and betting that falling bond yields will drag the U.S. dollar DXY lower against the Japanese yen USDJPY. Berezin expects that the yield on the 10-year Treasury note BX:TMUBMUSD10Y could fall to 3% if his recession scenario pans out, while the fed-funds target rate could be cut to 2%.

By comparison, the 10-year was at 4.34% as of Friday, while the fed-funds target rate remains in a range of 5.25% and 5.5%.

For its part, J.P Morgan’s top strategist, Marko Kolanovic, reaffirmed his target for the S&P 500, which is calling for the index to drop more than 23% from current levels by year’s end.

According to JPM’s midyear outlook, released this week, the investment bank expects U.S. growth to moderate during the second half of 2024.

The investment bank’s bear case for stocks is based on the notion that the megacap names that have driven much of the market’s rally over the past year will face an increasingly high bar to impress investors with their earnings and forecasts.

Investor positioning and valuations for these names already look stretched, according to Kolanovic. This means that at some point, the artificial-intelligence trade that has been holding up the market should reverse — and when that happens, the S&P 500 should see a major pullback.

U.S. stocks were dipping in the red on Friday afternoon, as the S&P 500 and Nasdaq Composite COMP struggled in their attempt to finish off the first half of 2024 at record highs. The two indexes were each losing more than 0.1%, while the Dow Jones Industrial Average DJIA was down 0.3%.

Yahoo Finance,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/2-stock-split-stocks-buy-080200111.html,2024-06-29,08:02:00 UTC,"2 Stock-Split Stocks to Buy Hand Over Fist Before They Soar as Much as 75%, According to Select Wall Street Analysts","A resurgence in the popularity of stock splits has been front and center in 2024 as a number of high-profile stocks have taken the plunge. Companies will typically go down this path after years or even decades of robust operating and financial results have pushed the stock price out of reach of some investors. While a stock split doesn't change anything about the underlying value of the business, it does make shares more affordable for employees and everyday investors, a reason that is often given by companies as the principal motivation for the split.

Investors, however, should focus on the robust results that ultimately led to the stock split, as this is historically an indicator of a business that is firing on all cylinders, which is a brilliant reason to own the stock.

Let's take a look at two companies that still have significant upside ahead, according to certain Wall Street analysts.

Image source: Getty Images.

Nvidia: Implied upside 59%

The first stock-split stock with mounds of upside is Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA). The chipmaker was already the gold standard for graphics processing units (GPUs) used by gamers and in data centers. However, the advent of generative artificial intelligence (AI) early last year kicked its business into overdrive.

The company is referred to as a ""picks-and-shovels play."" The investing reference has its origins in a famous quote attributed to Mark Twain: ""During the gold rush, it's a good time to be in the pick and shovel business."" For the AI gold rush, Nvidia is supplying the picks and shovels.

The parallel-processing capability of Nvidia's GPUs was groundbreaking for rendering lifelike images in video games. It allows them to run a magnitude of mathematical calculations simultaneously. It turns out this same functionality works equally well at processing AI.

Nvidia's recent results show why most analysts on Wall Street are upbeat. For its fiscal 2025 first quarter (ended April 28), Nvidia's revenue jumped 262% year over year to a record $26 billion, while earnings per share (EPS) surged 629% to $5.98. The company's data center segment, which includes the processors used for AI, has become the company's biggest money maker, as revenue of $22.6 billion jumped 427%.

Nvidia recently completed its high-profile, 10-for-1 stock split, and despite posting gains of more than 194% over the past year (as of this writing), Wall Street remains remarkably bullish. Rosenblatt analyst Hans Mosesmann boosted his price target to $200 while reiterating a buy rating on the shares. That represents potential gains for investors of 59% compared to Tuesday's closing price.

Story continues

Accelerating demand for AI-centric processors forms the foundation of the analyst's thesis, but he believes the secret sauce is Nvidia's proprietary software that's coupled with its best-in-class chips.

""We anticipate this software aspect will significantly increase in the next decade in terms of overall sales mix, with an upward bias to valuation due to sustainability,"" Mosesmann wrote. The analyst's price target suggests Nvidia's market will soar to nearly $5 trillion over the next year.

Despite the stock's epic run over the past year, Wall Street is still remarkably bullish on Nvidia. Of the 57 analysts who offered an opinion on the stock in May, 53 rated the stock a buy or strong buy, and none recommended selling.

Celsius Holdings: Implied upside of 75%

Another stock-split stock with significant upside potential is Celsius Holdings (NASDAQ: CELH). The company's focus on health-centric energy drinks has been a hit with consumers. It's the third-largest energy drink brand and the fastest-growing, contributing 47% of all industry growth in the first quarter, outpacing larger rivals Red Bull and Monster Beverage.

Celsius holds an enviable position in an industry that continues to grow. The energy drink category has continued to generate robust growth over the past three years, even as the broader beverage category has contracted -- and Celsius is leading the charge.

In the first quarter, revenue grew 37% year over year to $356 million, while diluted EPS surged 108%. It's always encouraging when profits are growing faster than revenue, as this illustrates that a company has reached the scale necessary to drop more income to the bottom line.

The company's sales more than doubled last year as it leaned into its partnership with PepsiCo, which resulted in the beverage and snacks giant making a $550 million investment in Celsius, taking an 8.5% stake in the company and inking a long-term distribution agreement. This is a double-edged sword, however, as Celsius now faces tough comps after such a banner year.

Celsius Holdings conducted its 3-for-1 stock split late last year, thanks to its track record of robust performance. However, fears regarding slowing growth have punished the stock, which has shed 42% over the past month, but some on Wall Street are undaunted. Jefferies analyst Kaumil Gajrawala has a $98 price target and a buy rating on the shares. That represents potential gains for investors of 75% compared to Tuesday's closing price. The analyst noted the drawdown is ""normal in year two of [a] national distribution"" agreement and advises investors to ignore the ""near-term noise.""

The analyst isn't the only one bullish on Celsius. Of the 16 analysts who offered an opinion on the stock in May, 14 rated the stock a buy or strong buy, and none recommended selling.

Yahoo Finance,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/john-deere-announces-mass-layoffs-172937300.html,2024-06-29,17:29:37 UTC,John Deere announces mass layoffs in Midwest amid production shift to Mexico,"John Deere, the world’s largest seller of tractors and crop harvesters, has announced another wave of layoffs Friday, telling around 610 production staff at plants in Illinois and Iowa that they will be out of a job by the end of the summer.

The company is slashing around 280 workers from a plant in East Moline, Illinois, while another 230 employees are being let go at a factory in Davenport, Iowa. About 100 production employees at the company’s Dubuque, Iowa, plant will also be impacted. All layoffs are said to be effective from Aug. 30, the company tells Fox Business.

The layoffs are being made due to reduced demand for John Deere's products from those factories.

The company says it generated $10.166 billion in profits last year.

JOHN DEERE EXPERT PREDICTS BATTERY-POWERED LAWN MOWER DEMAND WILL ‘RAPIDLY ESCALATE’

""We can confirm Deere leadership recently communicated that rising operational costs and declining market demand requires enterprise-wide changes in how work gets done to achieve our goals and best position the company for the future,"" a statement from John Deere reads.

Workers are to be offered Supplemental Unemployment Benefit (SUB) which will cover about 95% of their weekly net pay for up to 26 weeks, depending on their years of service. They are also being given profit-sharing options and health benefits.

Deere, known for its iconic green and yellow colors and jumping deer logo, is one of America's oldest companies, having been established in 1837, nearly 25 years before the start of the Civil War.

Earlier this month, Deere announced it is moving the manufacturing of skid steer loaders and compact track loaders from its Dubuque facility to Mexico by the end of 2026.

A John Deere 9700 Forage Harvester at the World Agriculture Expo in Tulare, California on Feb. 13, 2024.

The company said the decision was due to it evolving its business model and to address rising manufacturing costs and improve operational efficiencies.

""This includes optimizing our factories for future products, making our operations more efficient and taking advantage of locations in the U.S. and globally, with a growing labor force,"" a statement from the company reads.

In October, John Deere announced its first wave of 225 layoffs at its Harvester Works plant in East Moline. Another 34 production employees were laid off in May at its Moline Cylinder Works factory, while in March, company officials announced that they would lay off 150 more workers at a plant in Ankeny, Iowa, where sprayers and cotton pickers are made.

About 500 employees have been let go at its Waterloo plant in Iowa, per WQAD.

JOHN DEERE CEO PUTS 80-ACRE HORSE FARM UP FOR SALE

One longtime John Deere worker at the Harvester Works plant in East Moline, blamed the latest announcement on greed.

""We get wind of more layoffs daily, it seems, and it's causing uncertainty all over,"" the worker, who wished to remain anonymous, told The Guardian. ""The only reason for Deere to do this is greed.""

Deere & Co’s market capitalization stood around $102.81 billion as of Friday evening. In mid-May, the company said it had generated $27.42 billion in net sales and revenues over the first two quarters of the year. Its net income for the same timeframe was $4.121 billion.

The company recently trimmed its annual profit forecast for the second time and projected steeper declines in sales of large agricultural equipment.

Lower crop prices are leaving agricultural equipment sellers with an excess of unsold tractors and combines, leading some to offer discounts and suspend new orders.

The Department of Agriculture has also forecast farm income would slide 25.5% to $116.1 billion this year from 2023.

The news of layoffs comes amid a report on Wednesday that John Deere CEO John May has put his 80-acre horse farm property up for sale. Its asking price has been set at $3.925 million, according to its listing.

Reuters contributed to this report.

The chart of the day

What we're watching

What we're reading

Economic data releases and earnings

The weight of high expectations is often a heavy burden to carry.

In life, if you are a top performer at work, it's expected that you will show up to be a top performer every single day. Having a bad day? That's not allowed, so go sling that crap somewhere else.

Sure, some college professor who gave an inspiring leadership speech at a TED Talk 10 years ago and is now appearing in one-minute clips on your Instagram feed might suggest it's OK to have bad days at work, even if you are a winner.

Trust me, it's not — and don't let that social clip allow you to think otherwise.

This same philosophy could be applied to the stock market's most important stock: Nvidia (NVDA).

I know you like that transition, Morning Brief readers! Hear me out on this top performer in the market.

Over the past week, we were reminded of how inflated expectations are for Nvidia and how the stock has entered dangerous waters that many traders who arrived late to the Nvidia game have never navigated before.

On June 18, Nvidia's market cap hit a staggering $3.34 trillion, eclipsing Microsoft (MSFT) to become the world's most valuable company. Over the next three trading days, on seemingly no fundamental news, the company shed $430 billion in market cap.

For perspective, Coca-Cola's (KO) market cap is $275 billion.

Some folks I talked with told me people were taking profits on Nvidia going into the start of the second half of the year. Others I talked to for my ""Opening Bid"" podcast told me there is some chatter about new competitors entering Nvidia's turf, and maybe the company won't be as absurdly dominant over the next five years as many anticipate.

All of that is fair, but it reinforces the view that the stock is prone to sharp, out-of-the-blue negative shifts in sentiment because it's up 3,000% in five years.

But if you drill down further, you can see just how intense the expectations on Nvidia have become.

Nvidia's stock now trades at about 21x (super steep) forward sales, up from 12x (also steep) two months ago, according to research from Creative Planning chief market strategist Charlie Bilello. This is a significant premium over Microsoft at 12x and Apple (AAPL) at 8x, two tech titans that are performing very well fundamentally and are likely to continue rocking years ahead.



Nvidia's stock recently traded about 100% above its 200-day moving average, BTIG chief market technician Jonathan Krinsky pointed out. Since 1990, the widest spread that any US company has ever traded above its 200-day moving average while it was the largest company in the world was 80% by Cisco (CSCO) in March 2000, which marked its all-time high. ""In other words, Nvidia is in a league of its own,"" Krinsky said.

It sure seems that way.

Similar expectations were applied to chipmaker Micron (MU) going into earnings this week. The stock got blasted due to ""in-line"" guidance that didn't meet crazy expectations for anything tied to AI demand.

And I emphasize crazy: On Monday, several sell-side analysts jacked up their estimates and price targets on Micron ahead of the report. As someone who used to manage a team of stock researchers, I can tell you that this action heading into an earnings report is not the norm.

Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang delivers a speech during the Computex 2024 exhibition in Taipei, Taiwan, on June 2, 2024. (AP Photo/Chiang Ying-ying) (ASSOCIATED PRESS)

It reeked of analysts buying into the hype too much and hoping for a giant one-day pop in the stock.

""When you get a reaction like Micron's, where the numbers should be good enough to avoid a sell-off, let alone spur a rally, that’s a bad sign — a tell that expectations are so high that they can't be exceeded,"" Interactive Brokers chief strategist Steve Sosnick told me.

Others don't agree with my assessment that Nvidia is priced for perfection, and that is totally fine. I don't have a monopoly on good ideas!

""But for medium- to longer-term investors, the story still holds when we look at how far out their capacity is booked and pricing is firming,"" Tematica Research co-founder and chief investment officer Chris Versace said.

One thing we can all agree on: Nvidia is a top-performing employee in the market, and it will get no pass for trying to take a day off if it catches a cold.

Speaking of expensive tech stocks, shares of Amazon (AMZN) are up 55% in the past year. Questions linger about its culture, however. WSJ reporter Dana Mattioli talked about her explosive new book ""The Everything War: Amazon’s Ruthless Quest to Own the World and Remake Corporate Power"" in an episode of the ""Opening Bid"" podcast.

Yahoo Finance,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/planning-taking-rmds-converting-them-123000986.html,2024-06-29,16:00:42 UTC,"I Want to Put My RMDs in a Roth IRA, But Was Told I Can't. Is That True?","A woman and her husband look over their IRA balances as they talk about their plan for retirement.

If you’re looking for a tax-savvy way to deal with you required minimum distributions (RMDs), converting them into a Roth IRA isn’t an option.

A financial advisor can help you plan for RMDs and figure out if a Roth conversion is right for you.

It’s relatively common for retirees to need a plan for their required minimum distributions. That’s particularly true for households that don’t need their RMDs to cover living expenses and other spending needs. While you can reinvest these withdrawals in taxable accounts, the IRS restricts how you can fund tax-advantaged accounts like a Roth IRA.

Among those restrictions: you can only make IRA contributions with earned income. As a result, you can’t use RMDs to directly fund a Roth IRA.

What Are RMDs?

Required minimum distributions (RMDs) are the mandatory withdrawals that must be taken from a tax-deferred retirement account starting atage 73.

Starting at age 73 (or 72 depending on your birthdate), the IRS requires you to begin withdrawing a minimum amount each year from your pre-tax retirement accounts, such as 401(k) plans and IRAs. The exact amount depends on your age and the amount in your portfolio. To calculate your RMD, you divide the portfolio’s balance at the end of the year by a published life expectancy factor.

For any given year that you don’t take the full distribution, the IRS will charge you a tax penalty of either 10% or 25% of the amount that’s not withdrawn. For example, say that you don’t withdraw a required $10,000. You could face a tax penalty of up to $2,500.

The IRS requires you to take RMDs from tax-deferred accounts because each withdrawal is a tax event that triggers income taxes. Since you’ve already paid taxes on the money in Roth accounts, the IRS doesn’t require you to take minimum distributions from them. But if you have additional questions surrounding RMDs, consider speaking with a financial advisor.

Can You Invest RMDs in a Roth IRA?

For some retirees, the problem with a required minimum distribution is that they don’t need the money yet. This comes up, particularly for people who alreasdy sufficient income streams or those who hold multiple accounts and want to draw them down one at a time.

While you have several options for how to manage these distributions, you cannot reinvest them in a Roth IRA.

Roth IRA Requirements

You can only make IRA contributions with what’s called “earned income. This is defined as money that you receive from wages, salary, contract income and other forms of work. You cannot make contributions to an IRA – whether its a traditional or Roth account – from investment proceeds, capital gains or many passive income streams like rental properties.

This means that you’re free to get a job in retirement and put that money into a Roth IRA for later in life. However, you cannot withdraw money from a portfolio and transfer it into a Roth IRA or any other form of tax-advantaged retirement account. The IRS discusses this restriction in full in Publication 590-A.

Story continues

Conversions Are Also Restricted

This subject can get confusing because of the overlap between a withdrawal and a conversion. When you have a pre-tax portfolio, like a 401(k) or an IRA, you are allowed move money directly into a Roth IRA in what’s called a conversion. You take out a lump sum of money from a tax-deferred account, pay income taxes on the amount and deposit it into the Roth IRA.

However, the IRS specifically prohibits you from converting any required distributions into a Roth IRA. You can convert money that isn’t a required distribution, but the law is unambiguous that you cannot do so with an RMD. Navigating the IRS rules for RMDs and Roth conversions can be confusing, which is way you may want to consider connecting with a financial advisor.

Alternative Options for Roth IRAs and Required Minimum Distributions

A woman considers what to do with her RMD in the coming year.

So, what should you do instead? For retirees, there are a couple of options for how to manage RMDs.

First, you can convert the rest of your pre-tax portfolio after you meet the RMD requirements. In any year with an RMD, the first dollars you withdraw from that account are treated as part of your RMD. Once you meet the minimum amount, you’re free to convert the rest of your account (in whole or in part) into a Roth.

Say you have a $10,000 RMD in a given year. You first must withdraw that $10,000 before you may convert any remaining, eligible amount in your retirement account to a Roth IRA. As always, when doing so remember that Roth earnings have a five-year cooling-off period, so make sure you won’t need this money right away. And if you withdraw any of the money you convert before the five-year period is up, you could owe a 10% penalty on the money (unless you’re age 59 ½ or older).

Second, it is common for retirees to reinvest their minimum distributions. While you can’t put this money back into a tax-advantaged retirement account, you can put it into a taxable investment portfolio. The exact nature of these investments will vary based on your financial strategy and needs. Some retirees may do well investing for growth, taking money that they don’t need and putting it into equity-heavy funds. Others may do well investing for security, taking money that they will need someday and putting it into bond-heavy funds or annuities.

But if you need additional help reinvesting your RMDs, a financial advisor can help you make a plan to put this money to work for you.

Bottom Line

You cannot reinvest required minimum distributions in a Roth IRA. While you can convert any remaining amount from your pre-tax retirement account, the IRS specifically prohibits you from putting RMD funds in a tax-advantaged portfolio. However, RMDs don’t not need to be the end of your investing. You are free to invest this money in a taxable account as you see fit or convert your remaining IRA or 401(k) funds into a Roth account after your RMD for the year has been met.

Tips on Managing Required Minimum Distributions

The RMD formula can be difficult to manage, mostly because the IRS’ “life expectancy factor” can seem very arbitrary on the surface. But figuring out what you will need to withdraw is an important piece of long-term retirement planning puzzle.

A financial advisor can help you plan for and manage your RMDs. Finding a financial advisor doesn’t have to be hard. SmartAsset’s free tool matches you with up to three vetted financial advisors who serve your area, and you can have a free introductory call with your advisor matches to decide which one you feel is right for you. If you’re ready to find an advisor who can help you achieve your financial goals, get started now.

Keep an emergency fund on hand in case you run into unexpected expenses. An emergency fund should be liquid -- in an account that isn't at risk of significant fluctuation like the stock market. The tradeoff is that the value of liquid cash can be eroded by inflation. But a high-interest account allows you to earn compound interest. Compare savings accounts from these banks.

Yahoo Finance,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/broadcom-stock-once-generation-investment-091300997.html,2024-06-30,09:13:00 UTC,Is Broadcom Stock a Once-in-a-Generation Investment Opportunity Ahead of Its 10-for-1 Stock Split on July 12?,"When Broadcom (NASDAQ: AVGO) released the results of its fiscal 2024 second quarter, ended May 5, the company delivered results that sailed past Wall Street's expectations. More intriguing for shareholders, however, was another development.

In conjunction with its financial report, Broadcom's management revealed a 10-for-1 stock split. Since its announcement on Jun 12, shares have climbed 6% (as of this writing), and the stock has gained 93% over the past year. This helps to illustrate the ongoing interest from investors, likely spurred higher by the vast opportunity represented by artificial intelligence (AI).

The stock split is scheduled to take place after the market close on Friday, July 12. Does the upcoming stock split make Broadcom a once-in-a-generation investment opportunity? Let's see what the evidence reveals.

Stock split recap

A quick review of the purpose of the stock split can help give this process context. If a company delivers strong operational and financial performance over an extended period, demand for stock ownership increases, which is reflected in an increasing share price. Unfortunately, this oft times makes the stock inaccessible to some everyday investors.

To rectify the situation, management can initiate a stock split, reducing the share price. The company noted in its report that the purpose of the split was ""to make ownership of Broadcom stock more accessible to investors and employees."" The result is that everyday investors will be better able to buy full shares rather than resorting to purchasing fractional shares, which are available at a number of brokerage firms.

Once the stock split is completed, shareholders of record will receive nine additional shares of Broadcom stock for every share they own. At the same time, the price of each share will be reduced to 1/10th of the price, so the total value of each shareholder's investment won't change.The stock is due to split after the market close on Friday July 12, and begin trading on a split-adjusted basis on Monday, July 15. What should be more important to investors, however, is that the same factors that have driven Broadcom stock higher in recent years will still be at work.

Is Broadcom stock a buy?

The process of the stock split aside, the quintessential investing question remains: Is Broadcom stock a buy before its highly publicized stock split? Let's take a look at the company's recent results.

In the second quarter, Broadcom reported revenue of $12.5 billion, jumping 43% year over year and 4% sequentially. This pushed adjusted earnings per share (EPS) of $10.96 up 6%. Management said robust demand for generative AI was driving the results, noting that sales of AI-related products surged to a record $3.1 billion and now accounted for 25% of the company's total revenue.

Story continues

Management suggested the trend will likely continue. Broadcom raised its full fiscal year guidance to $51 billion, which would represent year-over-year growth of 42%.

The company is also developing a consistent track record of dividend payments. Broadcom is now in its 14th consecutive year of increasing payouts. From humble beginnings in mid-2013, the company has increased its payout from $0.21 to $5.25 per quarter, an increase of 2,400%. Wall Street expects Broadcom to earn $47.49 per share in 2024. That works out to a payout ratio of 44% of this year's expected profits, based on the current quarterly dividend, so there's plenty of room to increase the payout.

A once-in-a-generation investment opportunity?

Most experts agree that the accelerating adoption of AI has only just begun, and demand will only grow from here. Because generative AI automates many time-consuming and mundane tasks, it increases productivity, which leads to higher profits.

While estimates vary considerably, the impact of generative AI on the economy is expected to be between $2.6 trillion to $4.4 trillion over the coming decade, according to research compiled by McKinsey & Company, representing a once-in-a-generation opportunity. It's worth noting, however, that estimates have been increasing over time, so the actual impact may be higher as new applications for AI are created. Broadcom's extensive reach in technology circles gives the company the potential to grab an increasingly larger piece of the AI pie.

Over the past five years, Broadcom has been on fire, as revenue increased 126%, driving net income up 197%. This, in turn, has driven the stock price up 463% during the same period (as of this writing), more than five times the returns of the S&P 500. Furthermore, the stock has gained 93% over the past year alone, as its pivotal place in the AI ecosystem is boosting its results.

Broadcom currently trades for 33 times forward earnings, which is a premium compared to a multiple of 28 for the S&P 500. However, given its significant outperformance over the past five years, its clear that Broadcom is deserving of a premium.

Given the company's strong track record of results, pervasive reach, and prevailing secular tailwinds, I would argue that the evidence supports the case that Broadcom is a once-in-a-generation investment opportunity ahead of its 10-for-1 stock split. That said, I don't think it matters if you buy Broadcom before or after the stock split -- as long as you buy it.

During an episode of the personal finance help show, The Dave Ramsey Show, the show host and celebrated finance guru, Dave Ramsey, received a call from a woman who decided to change her finances. She called for advice and left with an unexpected gift from Ramsey.

Don't Miss:

Can you guess how many retire with a $5,000,000 nest egg? – How does it compare to the average?

Miami is expected to take New York's place as the U.S. Financial Capital. Here's how you can invest in the city before that happens.

The episode started with caller Tasia, who revealed to Ramsey that she had found his page on the TikTok social media app, which gave her the push she needed to start working her way out of debt. Tasia told Ramsey that she started her emergency fund, which Ramsey and his team have been teaching people to do. According to Ramsey Solutions, a starter emergency fund should have at least $1,000 as a temporary buffer, while a fully-funded emergency fund should save at least 3-6 months of expenses.

In addition to creating an emergency fund, Tasia told Ramsey that his advice helped her avoid overdrafting any accounts. Tasia revealed that she had been overdrafting her bank accounts her whole life, so this was a significant achievement for her, and Ramsey agreed. He told her, ""This is a breakthrough, isn't it, kid? Way to go.""

When it comes to overdraft, Tasia isn't alone. U.S. Sen. Bob Casey sent a news release in April this year slamming large corporate banks for profiting from excessive overdraft fees. In his statement, Casey wrote, ""Roughly 23 million households pay overdraft fees each year"" and that ""26 percent of Americans reside in a household that faced an overdraft fee or non-sufficient fund fee in the last year."" Casey revealed that American families are struggling to make ends meet, and more are going into overdraft. According to ABC News, Americans paid a whopping $9 billion in overdraft fees last year, with banks charging around $35 per transaction in overdraft. Currently, lawmakers are in the process of passing a rule to try and cut these overdraft fees.

Trending: If there was a new fund backed by Jeff Bezos offering a 7-9% target yield with monthly dividends would you invest in it?

Now that Tasia has managed to get herself out of overdraft, she can focus on growing her savings account. She told Ramsey that with her three jobs combined, she earns $90,000 annually and has around $30,000 still in debt, with half that amount being student loans. Ramsey told her, ""You're ready to go. You're ready to try new stuff because you're sick and tired of being sick and tired."" Ramsey also told Tasia that he was proud of her and then revealed his gift to her: a paid 9-week Financial Peace University class and paid access to the EveryDollar budgeting app. Ramsey explained that he's gifting her this experience because she is the reason why he does the show. He explained, ""People that are like you, that have for the first time in your whole adult life, you're not doing overdraft because we taught you something,"" and added, ""Now, we're going to teach you how to get rid of this debt."" Ramsey told Tasia he would teach her how to be a millionaire.

Story continues

When Ramsey had finished telling Tasia his gift to her, she was in tears at the unexpected gesture and told him, ""This has been my dream to talk to you."" Ramsey told Tasia that he would help her take control of her money instead of wondering where it went, giving her the tools to make sound financial decisions. With Ramsey Solutions, Tasia will learn how to use the snowball method of paying off her debts, from smallest to largest. Ramsey promised that if she follows this advice and stays out of restaurants with no vacations, she would be 100% debt-free by next year.

Yahoo Finance,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/could-buy-only-3-stocks-093200974.html,2024-06-30,09:32:00 UTC,"If I Could Buy Only 3 Stocks in 2024, I Would Pick These","Investors can own as many stocks as they want whenever they want, and thankfully so. After all, more stocks mean more diversification. In this vein, The Motley Fool suggests holding at least 25 different stocks at any given time.

Sometimes, though, it's eye-opening to think about which stocks you would buy if you could only buy a small number of them. Such an exercise forces you to identify the market's most promising risk-versus-reward scenarios.

With that as the backdrop, here's a rundown of the three names I would buy this year if I only had room and money to add another three tickers to my portfolio. (These picks, of course, only make sense for you if they improve your portfolio's diversification rather than making it less balanced.)

1. MercadoLibre

MercadoLibre (NASDAQ: MELI) is often referred to as the Amazon of Latin America. It's not an unfair comparison, but it is an incomplete one.

MercadoLibre is also akin to eBay, Shopify, and PayPal. Its wide lineup of tools has helped the company become South America's premier name in brick-and-mortar and e-commerce technology. The company facilitated nearly $41 billion in payments in the first quarter of this year while also serving as the middleman for $11.4 billion worth of sales of goods and services. Its subsequent revenue of $4.3 billion during the quarter was up 36% year over year, driving a 71% improvement in net income.

And this is still just the beginning. In many ways, South America is now where North America was roughly 20 years ago, when high-speed internet was still relatively new and smartphones were still only an idea. In the same way that Amazon was in the right place at the right time with the right business model, MercadoLibre is positioned to capitalize on the region's brewing mobile-technology boom.

And it is booming. Market researcher GSMA says 75 million people in South America became mobile internet users just within the past five years, while Canalys reports the region's smartphone shipments surged 26% year over year in the first quarter following the fourth quarter's growth of 20%.

Even so, only 65% of the continent's population currently uses a wireless broadband-capable smartphone. The rest are coming around, though. GSMA believes South America's mobile internet penetration rate will grow to 72% by 2030, with most of those connections likely to be ultra-high-speed 5G by that point.

Because e-commerce grows in step with consumers' growing ability to be online, Americas Market Intelligence is looking for Latin America's e-commerce market to grow 24% this year, then by another 21% next year, and then match that pace again in 2026.

Story continues

MercadoLibre is arguably better positioned than any other name to capitalize on this growth.

2. Alphabet

Few investors would deny that Google parent Alphabet (NASDAQ: GOOG) (NASDAQ: GOOGL) is still a force to be reckoned with. But plenty of people also seem to presume its highest-growth glory days are in the past. The search engine industry is fully matured, after all, and crowded with credible competition like Microsoft's artificial intelligence powered Bing.

If you don't think Alphabet has any growth engines left to rev, however, think again. Its cloud computing venture is an example. While still only a fraction of the size of Amazon's and Microsoft's cloud businesses, this segment still produced revenue growth of 28% during the first quarter of the year.

Better yet, Google Cloud is now consistently and meaningfully profitable, generating $900 million worth of operating profits in the three-month stretch ending in March. Mordor Intelligence expects the worldwide cloud computing market will grow at an annualized pace of more than 16% through 2029, so Alphabet's cloud segment holds tremendous profit promise.

Ratings agency Nielsen says the company's YouTube service is more watched within the United States than conventional streaming services like Netflix or Walt Disney's Hulu and Disney+. YouTube's top line improved 21% year over year in first quarter, as Alphabet continues to figure out how to make it a destination platform within the highly fragmented and often-unprofitable streaming space.

Google Search's advertising business might not be as stagnant as some suspect, too. Its ad revenue grew more than 14% during the first quarter of the year, helped by the search engine's sustained reach. GlobalStats says Google still handles about 90% of the world's web searches, as it has for well over a decade.

So Alphabet looks as strong as it's ever been. The fact that shares are rallying despite plenty of well-voiced worries should tell you everything you need to know about what investors see for its foreseeable future.

3. Bank of America

I would round out my limited number of stock picks for 2024 with a new position in Bank of America (NYSE: BAC).

It's not an easy name to get exciting about owning right now. The stock has underperformed since early 2022, dragged down by the economic malaise caused by sky-high inflation. Although high interest rates generally widen banks' profit margins, the subsequent trade-offs of that dynamic are diminished demand for loans as well as a greater number of loan defaults and delinquencies.

BofA's provision for loan losses grew to $1.3 billion in the first quarter, while net interest income slipped 3% to $14 billion, dragging per-share profits down from $0.94 in the first quarter of last year to $0.83 this time around. Other business lines like corporate banking and investment management are also running into headwinds.

Largely lost in all the noise, however, is that nothing about the banking industry's current challenges is new. This is a highly (and predictably) cyclical business tethered to an equally predictably cyclical economy.

We do not know exactly when inflation will finally abate or when the global economy will perk up again. We do know, however, we want to be positioned in BofA before it becomes clear that this recovery is happening. Like most stocks, this one tends to move predictively rather than reactively.

In the meantime, you're plugging into a ticker that's paying a healthy, reliable dividend. Although you can certainly find stocks with a bigger dividend yield than Bank of America's current forward-looking yield of a little more than 2.4%, this big bank is protecting its business and balance sheet in a way that ensures it will be able to continue funding its dividend payout as well as raise it.

Its annualized dividend payment of $0.96 per share is less than one-third of this year's expected per-share earnings of $3.25, and even relatively less than next year's estimate of $3.59. That's a nice cushion for anyone seeking dependable investment income.

Don’t miss this second chance at a potentially lucrative opportunity

Ever feel like you missed the boat in buying the most successful stocks? Then you’ll want to hear this.

Amazon: if you invested $1,000 when we doubled down in 2010, you’d have $21,765 !*

Apple: if you invested $1,000 when we doubled down in 2008, you’d have $39,798 !*

Netflix: if you invested $1,000 when we doubled down in 2004, you’d have $363,957!*

Right now, we’re issuing “Double Down” alerts for three incredible companies, and there may not be another chance like this anytime soon.

Yahoo Finance,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/nvidia-produce-massive-cash-gusher-165619422.html,2024-06-29,16:56:19 UTC,"Nvidia will produce such a massive ‘cash gusher’ that it will have to buy back more stock because all that money has nowhere else to go, analyst says","AI chip leader Nvidia will have an embarrassment of riches in the coming years, and shareholders will be rewarded, a tech analysts predicted.

Ben Reitzes, a managing director and head of technology research at Melius Research, told CNBC on Wednesday that Jensen Huang's Nvidia has mastered a ""full stack"" approach with its hardware and software, giving it a key advantage in AI.

""What they did is they built a computing language and an ecosystem that allows you to monetize AI, and obviously they're killing it,"" he said.

Reitzes has a price target of $160 on Nvidia stock, implying a 30% gain from Friday's closing price. Despite an ongoing selloff that began earlier this month, shares have soared 150% so far this year after more than tripling in 2023. Among the Magnificent 7 stocks that he covers, Nvidia has the most upside ahead, he added.

Another big advantage Nvidia has over rivals is its annual cadence of innovating new products, Reitzes said. That means developers and customers will know where Nvidia is headed and can a budget for upgrades accordingly.

""And they're running 150 miles an hour while everyone else is running 100. It's going to be hard to catch these guys,"" he said.

Given Nvidia's edge in the booming AI space, Melius Research projects the company will generate $270 billion in cash over the next three years, potentially setting the stage for huge shareholder returns.

Management may not be eager to tout the possibility of stock buybacks as those are often associated with older companies, Reitzes said. But in his view, it's obvious.

""No one's talking about it, and when you do the model we do, it's a cash gusher,"" he said. ""And there's nothing they can do. This government's not going to let them buy anything big. They can't invest that much in R&D. It's just not possible. So we gotta get it as shareholders.""

To be sure, Nvidia has been returning capital to shareholders. In August, it announced a $25 billion repurchase program. And last month, Nvidia boosted its quarterly cash dividend by 150% from $0.04 per share to $0.10, equivalent to $0.01 per share on a post-split basis.

Nvidia declined to comment about the possibility of more stock buybacks.

For his part, Reitzes was quick to point out that any future buybacks wouldn't imply that Nvidia has stopped growing. ""It's not an insult to buy back stocks if you have nothing else to do.""

Nvidia's recent financials show that its ability to generate cash is accelerating. In the fiscal year that ended in January, Nvidia's net cash provided by operating activities soared to $28.1 billion from $5.6 billion in the prior year.

Story continues

And in the first quarter that ended in April, net cash provided by operating activities was $15.3 billion—already more than half of last year's total.

Meanwhile, Huang told investors this past week that Nvidia will remain the gold standard for AI training chips amid concerns that rivals could cut into his market share.

The rollout of Nvidia’s Blackwell system later this year will only cement that lead, he said at the company’s annual shareholder meeting on Wednesday.

“The Blackwell architecture platform will likely be the most successful product in our history and even in the entire computer history,” Huang said.

Yahoo Finance,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/6-yield-dividend-stock-help-122200961.html,2024-06-30,12:22:00 UTC,This 6% Yield Dividend Stock Can Help You Build Wealth Brick by Brick,"Investors who strive for a specific investment return should love dividends because they are concrete returns you can't lose once paid. For example, suppose you want to earn 10% on a stock you own for a year. If that stock pays a dividend yielding 5%, you're already halfway to your goal!

You can rest easier knowing you have something to show for your investment and aren't entirely at the mercy of Wall Street's (often irrational) volatility.

Realty Income (NYSE: O) is a well-known dividend stock. It's famous for paying a rare monthly dividend and continually increasing the amount it pays. The company has raised its dividend for 31 consecutive years and counting.

You may have overlooked Realty Income recently. Shares have fallen 24% over the past five years.

Pay attention. I'll show you how powerful dividend stocks like Realty Income can be and why the stock is a wonderful buy today.

Do dividends matter? More than you realize

Realty Income is a real estate investment trust, or REIT. It's a company that acquires and leases real estate. In other words, it's like a landlord you can invest in, so that you can enjoy the cash flow real estate earns without buying buildings. Realty Income specializes in single-tenant retail properties, where one tenant, generally a consumer-facing business like a movie theater, convenience store, or gas station, rents the building.

REITs must pay at least 90% of their taxable income as dividends, so companies like Realty Income make great dividend stocks. Realty Income's dividend yield is approximately 6% at its current share price. Now, I get it. Nobody wants to be down 24% after five years. But the truth is that Realty Income's dividend has helped soften that blow quite a bit.

While the stock price is down 24% after five years, the stock's total return, including dividends, has investors close to break-even.

O Chart

To be fair to Realty Income, things have worked against the company these past five years. Real estate companies faced a generational crisis in COVID-19. Additionally, interest rates have surged higher. That's a problem for REITs because they rely heavily on borrowing to fund new property acquisitions. Realty Income has gotten a bad rap, primarily due to bad luck.

Ready to melt your mind? Zoom out further and see how big a difference dividends make over time. Realty Income has badly trailed the S&P 500 on price appreciation after decades, but it handily outperforms with dividends.

O Total Return Price Chart

Realty Income's share price declines get all the attention. Ironically, the dividends created big returns over time. Again, Realty Income's stock is down due to bad luck (pandemic and high rates), not because it's a bad business.

Story continues

Why is the stock poised for a comeback?

I suspect that Realty Income will eventually bounce back. For starters, the dividend, the most crucial aspect of the stock, is rock-solid. Analysts believe Realty Income will earn $4.22 per share this year. That is a dividend payout ratio of just 75% based on its annualized dividend per share.

Meanwhile, many expect interest rates across the U.S. economy to fall over time. The FOMC, which controls the primary interest rate in the economy, has been looking for inflation to come down, and recent data points to precisely that happening. Lower rates mean cheaper borrowing, which is a tailwind for REITs like Realty Income.

Realty Income stock now yields near its decade-high, and its price versus its cash flow is near its decade-low. That means the stock is cheap, and analysts still see Realty Income growing its distributable cash (profits for REITs) at a low-single-digit rate annually. Investors are looking at potential double-digit total returns when combining dividends and growth. A potentially higher valuation is just a bonus.

O Price to Free Cash Flow Chart

Remember, stocks like Realty Income can make you rich with their dividends. It just might take time. Investors should have no concerns over the dividend moving forward, and the stock's potential rebound is more icing on the cake than the main course.

Situations like this are how long-term investors win.

Soaring just shy of 30% year to date, Walmart is the best-performing component of the Dow Jones Industrial Average -- outpacing gains from Amazon, Microsoft, Apple, and other growth stocks. What's more, Walmart has raised its dividend for over 50 consecutive years -- making it a Dividend King.

Walmart has a clear plan for growing earnings and increasing its dividend -- but the stock has gotten more expensive and the yield is just 1.2%.

Tool and outdoor products maker Stanley Black & Decker (NYSE: SWK) is also a Dividend King. But the stock is down over 10% in the last three months and a painful 57% over the last three years. Here's why Stanley Black & Decker is out of favor, how it is turning things around, and why it is worth buying now.

A primer on Stanley Black & Decker

Stanley Black & Decker sells various hand tools, power tools, and accessories under brands like DeWalt, Stanley, Black+Decker, Craftsman, and others.

A whopping $13.4 billion or 85% of 2023 revenue came from its tools and outdoor segment, while just $2.4 billion came from its industrial business-to-business (B2B) segment. Sixty-two percent of 2023 sales were generated in the U.S. As such, the company has been heavily impacted by inflation, higher interest rates, weak consumer spending, and a challenged housing market. Meanwhile, other industrial companies that primarily engage in B2B sales -- such as General Electric and Siemens -- are hovering around all-time highs.

Peaks and valleys

Stanley Black & Decker has been on a roller coaster over the last few years. It achieved all-time high net income of $1.69 billion in 2021, only to lose a record $311 million in 2023. The following chart paints this dramatic picture well.

SWK Net Income (Annual) Chart

You may be wondering how a company can go from a period of growth and expansion to a period of weakness in just a few years. The short answer is that the COVID-19 pandemic threw a wrench in the toolmaker's business, disrupting supply chains and consumer behavior. Initially, Stanley Black & Decker benefited from a surge in goods spending, which is reflected in its 2021 results. But by 2022, it became clear that demand was merely pulled forward by a few years and that the boom was unsustainable.

Stanley Black & Decker's operating expenses increased to keep up with demand. But when demand fell, and revenue began to decline, those higher expenses ate away at margins. In 2023, Stanley Black & Decker had an operating margin barely over 4% compared to a pre-pandemic range of about 12% to 14% -- illustrating how inefficient the business has become.

SWK Revenue (Annual) Chart

Getting back on track

The company has implemented a massive cost-cutting effort to restore margins -- with a goal of reaching an adjusted gross margin of 35% over the long term and 30% for full-year 2024. Stanley Black & Decker achieved $145 million in pre-tax cost savings last quarter, bringing its aggregate cost savings to $1.2 billion since the program was launched in the second quarter of 2022.

To its credit, Stanley Black & Decker has stayed on track toward hitting its goals. When it first announced the program, it was guiding for $1 billion in pre-tax savings by the end of 2023 and $2 billion in savings within three years. During its first-quarter 2024 earnings call, Stanley Black & Decker said it was still targeting $1.5 billion in pre-tax run-rate savings by the end of 2024 and $2 billion by the end of 2025.

Reducing inventory has been another focus for the company. Stanley Black & Decker is forecasting $400 million to $500 million in inventory reductions for the full year and capital expenditures of just $400 million to $500 million. Reducing inventory and keeping a tight lid on spending should help the company reach its free-cash-flow (FCF) goal of $600 million to $800 million for the full year. That's still a way off from the $1.08 billion in FCF the company earned in full year 2019, which is a good benchmark considering it's before the pandemic disrupted its business.

A high yield with a (potentially) inexpensive valuation

2024 FCF guidance would allow Stanley Black & Decker to cover its dividend with FCF. In the recent quarter, Stanley Black & Decker paid $121.8 billion in dividends. Over the last couple of years, it has made minimum $0.01-per-share-per-quarter dividend raises to retain its status as a Dividend King -- which is understandable given the business is undergoing a turnaround. Therefore, investors should expect minimum raises over the next few years as well, meaning the annual dividend expense should be under $500 billion for 2024 and 2025.

A lower stock price paired with a moderately higher dividend has pole-vaulted Stanley Black & Decker's yield to 3.8% -- which is significantly higher than the 2% or so yield investors were getting pre-pandemic.

SWK Dividend Yield Chart

Given its net loss in 2023, Stanley Black & Decker currently has a negative price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio. However, analyst estimates reflect the impact of its cost-cutting efforts and a return to profitability. Average analyst estimates call for $4 in 2024 earnings per share (EPS) and $5.48 in 2025 EPS. Based on the 2025 EPS guidance, Stanley Black & Decker would have a P/E ratio of just 15.5 -- which is dirt cheap for a Dividend King. However, a lot could go wrong between now and when that full-year 2025 figure rolls in -- so investors shouldn't bank on analyst estimates.

Stanley Black & Decker is worth the wait

Stanley Black & Decker poorly navigated the COVID-19 pandemic, supply chain disruptions, and interest rates. And the stock price reflects these mistakes -- as it is just 15% or so off its 10-year low. However, the company has been doing a good job over the last seven quarters by sticking to its cost-cutting plan.

In the near term, Stanley Black & Decker's FCF projections indicate confidence that it can support its dividend with cash. Over the medium term, a return to profitability and earnings growth makes the stock look like a good value.

Even as the business recovers, investors shouldn't expect the company to drastically increase its dividend or buy back stock. The balance sheet has weakened in recent years due to higher debt. S&P Global's June 20 annual review of the company gave it an A- credit rating, which is good but could be improved.

At times like this, it's important to zoom out and think about where a business will be three to five years from now. If Stanley Black & Decker can return to its pre-pandemic form and chart a path toward growth, the valuation and yield will make the stock look too cheap to ignore. Patient investors may want to scoop up shares of the Dividend King now, while others may prefer to take a wait-and-see approach to ensure Stanley Black & Decker can effectively operate under a leaner business model.

Yahoo Finance,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/forget-nvidia-etf-could-turn-093900965.html,2024-06-29,09:39:00 UTC,"Forget Nvidia: This ETF Could Turn $25,000 Into $1 Million","Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA) has generated some massive returns for investors in recent years. But the danger in buying the stock today is that at an extremely high valuation, you might be limited in the returns you get from it. While it may still be a good long-term investment, you may be better off putting your money into other growth stocks instead.

You could even simplify your strategy even further by investing in an exchange-traded fund (ETF), which can give you exposure to a broad range of stocks while still putting you on a path to generate some great returns.

A fund with tremendous long-run potential

For growth investors, one ETF that is a popular option is the Invesco QQQ Trust (NASDAQ: QQQ). It tracks the Nasdaq-100 index and gives investors exposure to the top growth stocks in the world within just a single investment. It's a safer alternative than putting all or even most of your money into a few investments, even if you're incredibly bullish on them.

With the Invesco fund, you don't even need to stay on top of what the hot new growth stocks are, as the Nasdaq-100 is made up of the top 100 nonfinancial stocks on the exchange. You'll still get exposure to Nvidia, but along with that, you'll also have exposure to Microsoft, Apple, and many other top tech stocks.

By investing in the fund, you can put yourself in a good position to beat the markets. Over the past 10 years, the Invesco QQQ fund has generated total returns (which include dividends) of more than 450%, which is far higher than the S&P 500's comparable returns of 235%. That means that the ETF has averaged a compounded annual growth rate of 18.6% in the past decade -- well above the S&P 500's long-run average of around 10%.

The fund could put you on a path to reach $1 million

The Invesco ETF can be an ideal option for long-term investors due to the effects of compounding and its potential to generate significant annual returns. While a near-19% growth rate may be a bit of an optimistic expectation to set for any investment for the very long term, even at a much lower average annual return, the ETF could generate considerable wealth for investors who buy and hold.

Suppose, for example, that you invest $25,000 into the ETF. If it averages an annual growth rate of around 13%, then after a period of 30 years, it'll grow to be worth nearly $1 million. If you're able to invest $30,000, it would take less than 29 years to get to $1 million. And if you can invest additional funds over the years, that can help accelerate your gains.

Story continues

Invesco's ETF is a good default option for investors

If you're not sure what to invest in and are worried that hot stocks like Nvidia have become too expensive, the Invesco ETF can be a great option to consider investing in. It has a low expense ratio of 0.2%, and it gives you an easy way to invest in the best growth stocks in the world.

Even if you don't have a lot of money to invest today, you can periodically add to your investment every month or year to build up your position over time. And regardless of whether the ETF is up or down at the time you invest, it's likely to perform well in the long run, and that's ultimately what is most important.

Yahoo Finance,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/free-streaming-channels-have-become-sleeping-giants-as-netflix-max-others-hike-prices-154745358.html,2024-06-30,15:47:45 UTC,"Free streaming channels have become 'sleeping giants' as Netflix, Max, others hike prices","As streaming services get more expensive, consumers are increasingly turning to free content to fill out their entertainment diets.

Free ad-supported streaming platforms like the Roku Channel (ROKU), Fox affiliate Tubi (FOX), and Paramount's (PARA) Pluto TV, among others, have seen viewership steadily rise over the past few years, a surprising development given the lack of original content and heavy ad load on these channels, known as FAST channels.

FAST — which stands for free ad-supported streaming television — provides both linear and on-demand content in a single viewing experience that relies on advertising for monetization.

The rise of FAST comes as nearly every major streaming service has raised prices in recent months, including Paramount, Netflix (NFLX), Max (WBD), and Amazon (AMZN).

""It is different to be 100% free,"" Tubi CEO Anjali Sud said on the Ringer podcast ""The Town With Matthew Belloni"" in April.

""We're not asking you to subscribe to an ad tier or a subscription tier. We're not trying to upsell you. The fragmentation and friction is reduced.""

In other words, what appeals to users is the accessibility. Julie Clark, executive at marketing insights company TransUnion, described the model as a ""sleeping giant"" in the ever-evolving media landscape.

""FAST is easy, it's accessible,"" she told Yahoo Finance. ""You can get the basics that you need, like the news and the weather, but there's also older programming available and they're starting to have better distribution agreements there as well.""

To put it simply, FAST is the closest thing you can get to cable without actually paying for it. Not to mention that certain FAST providers, like the Roku Channel and Samsung's TV Plus, are also distributed across their respective smart TV devices, further broadening their presence for users.

""There's this catalog of content that is available within the FAST environment that you can binge all day,"" Clark said. ""And with recent price sensitivities, I think we're going to continue to see this grow.""

Content on FAST channels can encompass everything from made-for-TV movies and old shows from traditional studios to low-budget unscripted series, short-form videos, documentaries, and sports.

You still won't catch the new season of ""Bridgerton"" or the latest episode of ""The Bear."" But for cost-conscious consumers, that might not matter.

Tubi, which Fox acquired for $440 million in 2020, led year-over-year growth for the network following a nearly 5% monthly viewing increase in May, according to Nielsen. It secured a platform-best 1.8% of total TV usage for the month as a record 1 million viewers tuned in.

Story continues

Even more impressive? Its average audience for May came in ahead of traditional streamers Disney+, Peacock, Paramount+, and Max, Nielsen confirmed.

""A lot of people confuse Tubi as being sort of this passive FAST channel that is just on rotation in the background of a person's household. It's not,"" Fox CFO Steven Tomsic said at a MoffettNathanson conference last month. ""90% of Tubi consumption is [video on-demand] where it's a real lean-forward experience. People have deliberately chosen the title and watch through it.""

Tubi has experimented with original content, but its bread and butter revolves around its library. Tubi boasts more than 240,000 movies and TV series on its platform, the bulk of which is licensed. Its audience is 63% made up of ""cord cutters"" or ""cord nevers,"" while 40% are not subscribed to other traditional streamers.

Meanwhile, the Roku Channel, which has also dabbled in some original programming, saw a 1.3% monthly bump in viewing. That led the FAST provider to a platform-best 1.5% share of TV — the only company to climb in the rankings for May, nabbing 10th overall.

Competitors have taken notice. Bloomberg recently reported that Netflix is weighing its own free ad-supported tier in certain markets like Europe and Asia. It won't roll out a free version in the US since its subscriber base in the country is already heavily penetrated, according to the report.

But the FAST business model remains unproven. Tubi, for example, has yet to turn a profit. The long-term outlook also remains murky against the expected reacceleration of M&A within the media industry at large.

""I'm probably a little bit more cautious than others,"" Tim Nollen, analyst at Macquarie, told Yahoo Finance. He noted FAST providers must utilize a different strategic approach than other streamers, given their lack of premium or exclusive content.

""A lack of premium content means they have to be effective at using ad technology to target the users that they do have,"" Nollen said. ""It's a large audience, but it may not be a particularly engaged audience. I think they will be successful at using technology to target those users. But it might be in a somewhat different manner.""

Companies like Paramount, Fox, and Roku do not break out the financials of their respective FAST channels, although they're consistently called out as growth drivers on earnings calls.

Paramount, for instance, credited Pluto TV for its double-digit advertising revenue growth in the first quarter. Roku and Fox did the same.

The rise of ads on streaming

Advertising on connected TV, which refers to devices and platforms connected to the internet, has exploded in recent years. And it's not just FAST channels benefiting from the transition.

Companies like Netflix, Disney, and, most recently, Amazon have entered the ad-supported streaming space in recent years. That means more inventory and also more opportunities to better target and monetize consumers through technology.

""There's a lot of ability for advertisers to test, learn, and use sophisticated targeting that was only available within traditional digital advertising before,"" Clark told Yahoo Finance. ""That is absolutely leading to some of the growth in FAST and other ad-supported services.""

MoffettNathanson predicted total advertising on over-the-top streaming services will grow 33% this year, compared with a 17% increase in 2023, fueled by more consumers choosing ad-based streaming tiers.

""There's a comfort level [in] that value exchange,"" Clark said. ""Even younger consumers are getting used to ads on YouTube, so it's this natural progression.""

Ads are also easier to stomach if you know you're paying less (or nothing at all) to watch them.

""People value choice at the end of the day. And we have always been used to watching ads, whether it be on a cable network or on YouTube,"" said Vikrant Mathur, co-founder of Future Today, a company that specializes in ad-supported connected TV solutions.

""But now we have a choice. And if I can save money, I may be more willing to make that compromise.""

Yahoo Finance,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/another-artificial-intelligence-ai-stock-123000849.html,2024-06-30,12:30:00 UTC,Another Artificial Intelligence (AI) Stock Split Is Coming. Could Broadcom Be the Next Nvidia?,"If you believe its hype, artificial intelligence (AI) is one of the most profound advances in technology ever. This may be hyperbole -- time will tell -- but it's clear already that the technology has commercial power. Its impact in the market has been enormous, with its champion, Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA), joining Apple and Microsoft as among the biggest companies in the world.

Nvidia's rise led to the company splitting its stock 10-for-1, opening the door to more investors who were priced out. Now another company working in AI is splitting its stock, too. Broadcom (NASDAQ: AVGO), which designs, manufactures, and sells hardware and network infrastructure that allows AI programs to run, will split its stock later this summer.

So let's consider: Could Broadcom deliver the sort of returns Nvidia has?

Revenue growth has been impressive, but it's inflated by a major acquisition

Broadcom is in growth mode, having raised Q1 revenue by 34% from the year before Q2 revenue by 43% from Q2 2023.

AVGO Revenue (Quarterly) Chart

Notice the massive recent increase? That late-2023 inflection point is important. This growth isn't really organic -- much of it is coming from an acquisition. The company bought VMware, a highly successful cloud software company, in November 2023 for $69 billion, adding its revenue to Broadcom's.

Excluding this additional income from VMware, the company grew Q2 revenue by 12% on a year-over-year basis, not quite as eye-watering as the headline-catching 43%.

Looking at future earnings, the company looks reasonably valued

Still, 12% organic growth is nothing to shake a stick at and reflects Broadcom's growing AI-focused business. Communication within the AI server farms that power platforms like ChatGPT is a crucial aspect and is where Broadcom shines. Its PCIe and Ethernet technology is some of the best on the market. This made its products popular.

Hock Tan, Broadcom president and CEO, stated in the company's latest earnings release that ""revenue from our AI products was a record $3.1 billion during the quarter."" The combo of a growing AI business and a solid acquisition means that the company expects to continue delivering record revenues. It raised its guidance for this year to $51 billion in revenue, up 42% from 2023.

So what does this mean for how fairly valued the company is? If we look at its forward P/E, the company looks pretty solid at about 34. That's in line with much of big tech and is significantly lower than Nvidia's 48.

Broadcom is a solid company, but it'll have trouble rivaling Nvidia

Broadcom's growth prospects, while promising, just aren't comparable to Nvidia's, in my opinion. Nvidia is growing revenue at a pace that far outstrips Broadcom and doing it organically, not relying on costly acquisitions. Consensus estimates have Nvidia delivering more than twice the revenue growth of Broadcom by the end of this fiscal year and again next year.

Story continues

And this disparity will be even greater in looking at net income. Look at the difference over the last year.

AVGO Net Income (TTM) Chart

It's not just the acquisition affecting this. Nvidia expects to operate with roughly 20% better margins this year than Broadcom.

Aside from the numbers, Nvidia demonstrated immense vision as a pioneer in AI. While difficult to quantify, I think visionary leadership is an factor that can't be underestimated. As the industry matures and competition heats up, Nvidia's leadership may help it maintain its top position.

At the end of the day, however, Broadcom is still a good investment with a solid track record and optimistic prospects. Is it the next Nvidia? I don't think so, but it doesn't need to be.

Luckily, keeping tabs on the world's most successful investors isn't very hard to do.

Every three months, people managing a portfolio worth $100 million or more have to report their trading activity to the Securities and Exchange Commission. A quick look at the latest disclosures shows a handful of billionaire investors bought millions of shares of two dividend-paying stocks that currently offer ultra-high yields.

Shares of Pfizer (NYSE: PFE) and Annaly Capital (NYSE: NLY) offer yields that are several times the average stock in the benchmark S&P 500 index. Unfortunately, stocks rarely offer yields this high unless there's a good reason to worry about their ability to maintain their payout.

Let's look at their recent performance to find out if following the lead of billionaire fund managers makes sense for your portfolio.

Annaly Capital

Annaly Capital is a real estate investment trust (REIT) that buys mortgage-backed securities (MBSes) instead of real estate. It earns a living in the margins between its short-term borrowing expenses and the interest it receives from the hopefully higher-yielding MBS in its portfolio.

At recent prices, Annaly shares offer a mind-blowing 13.6% yield. The enormous yield is attracting funds run by billionaires. Citadel Advisors, which is run by Ken Griffin, and Millennium Management, which is run by Israel Englander, bought shares in the first quarter.

Annaly Capital doesn't own real estate, so it has to use its MBS portfolio to secure loans. It doesn't happen often, but from time to time, the value of its MBS can dip. When this happens, lenders demand more capital, and the company can end up selling off portions of its portfolio at fire sale prices.

NLY Dividend Chart

Before you jump up to fill your portfolio with shares of Annaly Capital, it's important to realize the company has lowered its dividend by 45.8% since 2019. Investors who bought the stock and reinvested all the dividends have gained only about 39% over the past decade.

While there's a good chance that buying Annaly Capital now and holding over the long run also leads to positive gains, the unpredictability of its dividend makes it a bad choice for most income-seeking investors.

Pfizer

During the first three months of 2024, John Overdeck and David Siegel of Two Sigma bought 18.9 million shares of Pfizer. The stock has fallen by more than half since its peak in late 2021.

Story continues

Pfizer's been dropping because record-breaking sales of its COVID-19-related products evaporated faster than the market expected. Now that the worst is over, though, the stock looks like a terrific bargain.

Pfizer's stock dropped, but the company still raised its dividend payout for the 15th consecutive year last December. The stock offers a 6.2% yield at recent prices, which is about 4.6 times more than you'd receive from the average dividend payer in the S&P 500.

At recent prices, you can buy Pfizer for around 11.6 times forward-looking earnings expectations. That's a reasonable valuation for a business you expect to grow at a snail's pace. A look at this drugmaker's recent performance and forward outlook suggests it will grow much faster than the market is expecting.

Pfizer invested heaps of COVID-19-related profits into new drugs, many of which are already on the market. If we exclude COVID-19-related sales and the negative effects of a stronger U.S. dollar, first-quarter sales rose 11% year over year.

Pfizer has the longest list of innovative new drugs in the pharmaceutical industry, and it's still growing relatively quickly. The FDA approved nine new medicines from the company in 2023, and they're poised to drive growth in the decade ahead. Adding some shares to a diversified portfolio looks like a relatively safe way for income-seeking investors to boost their passive income stream.

Yahoo Finance,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/1-stock-split-stock-buy-101500630.html,2024-06-30,10:15:00 UTC,1 Stock-Split Stock to Buy Hand Over Fist in the Second Half and 1 to Avoid Like the Plague,"The first half of the year brought the market many stock split announcements across industries, from technology giant Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA) to consumer stock Walmart. These companies launched splits to lower their share prices after the shares soared to high levels -- the idea is to make it easier for more people to invest without relying on fractional shares.

These players helped drive the S&P 500 higher in the first half of the year as investors welcomed the stock split news. Stock splits aren't share performance catalysts though, as they're just mechanical movements. So, investors who seize the opportunity to buy generally are making the move for a fundamental reason -- such as confidence in the company's future growth prospects.

Now, as we head into the second half of the year, you may be wondering which stock split players may continue their paths higher and represent the best long-term bets. Let's check out one to buy hand over fist, and one to avoid like the plague.

Image source: Getty Images.

Stock to buy: Nvidia

Nvidia already climbed more than 150% in the first half of the year thanks to its booming artificial intelligence (AI) business. The company sells the graphics processing units (GPUs) that power some of the most crucial AI tasks -- and Nvidia's GPUs are the fastest on the market. So, it's no surprise the company holds 80% share of the AI chip market.

The tech giant also sells a wide range of related AI products and services, including enterprise software -- available through all of the public cloud service providers. This makes access to Nvidia very easy for potential customers.

This has helped the company generate record revenue quarter after quarter, grow revenue and net income in the triple digits, and widen gross margin. In the most recent quarter, revenue reached $26 billion and gross margin came in at more than 78% -- from about 64% a year ago.

What makes me so optimistic about Nvidia in the second half and beyond? The company pledges to update its top performing chips on an annual basis, a strategy that should keep it ahead of rivals. As part of this, later this year Nvidia plans to launch its Blackwell architecture and chip -- a system laced with many innovations that could make it a game-changer.

All of this means Nvidia merits its valuation of 46 times forward earnings estimates, and the stock's gains this year and into the future may be far from over.

Stock to avoid: Chipotle

First, I'll start by saying Chipotle Mexican Grill (NYSE: CMG) isn't necessarily a sell or an avoid for every investor. This fast casual chain has progressively increased earnings over time, and its expansion strategy should keep that going. Chipotle's brand strength also may help it lift revenue over the long run too. So, if you're looking to diversify your portfolio and want to buy a solid restaurant stock, you may consider adding a few shares or if you're a Chipotle shareholder today, you might want to hold on to your position.

Story continues

But for the value investor, Chipotle is a stock to avoid, and here's why. The stock trades for 59 times forward earnings estimates, extremely high for the industry and high considering the source of Chipotle's growth. It's important to note that comparable restaurant sales growth has been in the mid-single digits -- increasing 7% in the first quarter of this year and 7.9% for the full year 2023. So Chipotle's growth mainly has come from adding on new restaurants -- it opened 271 last year.

Chipotle, now at about 3,500 locations, aims to double that to 7,000 in North America, and the company is expanding internationally too. It's fine to grow through expansion, but without stronger comparable sales increases, Chipotle doesn't look like a high-growth stock today, yet it's trading at growth stock prices.

Of course, over time, Chipotle shares still may have room to run as the company's new locations start adding to revenue. But, considering the hefty price tag for this stock, as we transition into the second half of the year, value investors should avoid this expensive player like the plague.

Yahoo Finance,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/2-unstoppable-dividend-stocks-buy-094000300.html,2024-06-30,09:40:00 UTC,2 Unstoppable Dividend Stocks to Buy if There's a Stock Market Sell-Off,"Dividend stocks offer a great way to add cash to your portfolio and help you compound your overall returns with time. Whether you use that dividend money to add to your portfolio or cash it out, these types of stocks can help you diversify the types of businesses you own shares in.

When it comes to investing in dividend stocks, you need to make sure the companies you buy have a strong underlying business and balance sheet that will support and help grow the dividends being paid out. A top dividend stock will also have a history of maintaining and raising its dividend in a wide range of market environments.

On that note, here are two top dividend stocks to consider for your portfolio. Each performs well, whether the bull market continues or bearish investor sentiment returns. If the bear market does return, these stocks have proven over the decades to be safe ones to hold.

1. Johnson & Johnson

Johnson & Johnson (NYSE: JNJ) has paid out and raised its dividend every single year for 62 years and counting. That places the pharmaceutical giant in a very select group of companies that have earned the moniker Dividend King.

J&J boasts a forward dividend yield of 3.4%, which is more than twice the average yield among S&P 500 stocks. Looking back over the last decade, Johnson & Johnson's dividend has increased an average of 6% annually. Its payout ratio is a very manageable 30%.

J&J's dividend helps to make up for the stock's relatively weak stock performance over the last several years. The weak stock performance also somewhat helps explain the higher-than-average yield. The stock is down based on several factors, but one of the biggest is ongoing litigation and potential multi-billion liabilities related to its talc products. The company has roughly $26 billion in cash on its balance sheet to help manage these ongoing lawsuits and eventually pay settlements while also maintaining its commitment to shareholders.

Investing in Johnson & Johnson also means putting cash into a company that has been in business for 138 years, and is one of the top pharmaceutical companies in the world by revenue. Over the trailing 12 months, the company has brought in over $17 billion in profits on about $86 billion in revenue. It's also generated approximately $24 billion in levered free cash flow looking back over the last 12 months.

Last year, J&J spun off its slower-growing consumer healthcare product segment into a company called Kenvue. The remaining two divisions -- pharmaceuticals and medical devices -- are faster growing and should help J&J boost its growth efforts in the coming years. The company has returned approximately 60% of free cash flow to investors over the last five years, while 65% of sales come from products in which it controls the top or second global market share position.

In the short term, this is likely not a business for growth-oriented investors. However, long-term investors seeking a company that generates steady financial gains from a broad portfolio of valuable pharmaceuticals and medical devices may find Johnson & Johnson poses a compelling investment opportunity. With its stock price underperforming, Johnson & Johnson's storied dividend history makes the business an attractive selection for income-seeking investors. When its underlying issues, including expensive litigation finally get resolved, share prices are likely to rise.

2. Coca-Cola

Coca-Cola (NYSE: KO) boasts a dividend yield of around 3% and has faithfully raised its dividend every year for 62 years as well. The beverage giant doesn't generate massive stock price gains these days, but its dividend and share price increases have helped deliver a total return of 46% over the last five years and over 108% in the trailing 10-year period.

Founded in 1886, the company now manages one of the largest beverage operations in the world. Coca-Cola controls roughly 46% of the soft drink market in the U.S., one of its largest markets.

Over the trailing 12 months, Coca-Cola has delivered profits of about $11 billion on revenue of $46 billion. It's maintained a profit margin of around 23%, an exceptional figure in an industry where margins are historically razor-thin. The company has a payout ratio of about 74%, which is relatively high but still quite manageable. Its dividend has grown an average of 5% annually over the past decade.

Just in the past 12 months, the company has brought in operating cash flow of about $12 billion, with levered free cash flow of approximately $11 billion. Currency headwinds and a fluctuating macro environment have impacted the company's growth in the last few years, but its commitment to its dividend and the strength of its balance sheet remain a testament to the resilience of this business.

Long-term buy-and-hold investors looking for steady portfolio growth and dividends can find a lot to love about Coca-Cola.

Getty Images; Alyssa Powell/BI

Amid a widespread retirement crisis in the US, some boomers are entering their golden years flush with savings.

They're benefiting from now-rare pensions, real estate value increases, and stock market gains.

But lower-income households face challenges with retirement savings and dwindling pension plans.

If you're looking for Michael, 75, try looking to the sky.

The retiree has a unique retirement side gig: He's a corporate airplane pilot.

He dabbles just with contract gigs because he loves it; that's a common theme for Michael at this stage in life. He's living the retirement dream, and splitting his time between Florida and Denver. According to documentation that Business Insider reviewed, his net worth, after a career spent in the Navy and then working in geology, is just over $6 million.

""It's totally comfortable. We absolutely have all the money that we need to live our life,"" he said. And that nest egg has made a huge emotional difference: He has no financial stress.

It's a similar story for Connie, a 79-year-old who said she didn't really start retirement planning until she was in her 30s, newly divorced, and working a state government job in Oregon. After about 20 years in the public sector, she was able to retire with a nice pension — a type of benefit that's increasingly rare these days. Her Social Security checks were also bolstered when her former spouse's survivor benefits kicked in. In her retirement, she earns more than she did from her previous salary.

""It gives me great peace of mind,"" Connie said. It also fills her with some pride: Her research and frugality paid off.

""I definitely fall into that category of people who had just a totally ordinary career and never made big money, and yet now my retirement income is probably one and a half times what I ever made working,"" she said.

The three retirees Business Insider spoke with for this story are bright spots amid a retirement crisis in which over half of Americans 65 and older live on just $30,000 a year, and Social Security funds are expected to start depleting in 2035 without legislative intervention. All of their full names are known to BI, but their last names have been withheld over privacy concerns.

As the way we save for retirement has evolved, some people are now cashing in on the golden age for retirement savings — when benefits were more generous and investments in real estate and stocks boomed. While it's still possible to achieve, a fat retirement account has become rarer. And the retirees who are living that dream are grateful.

Story continues

""Being in retirement and not having any financial stress and being able to help our kids and travel to go see them and stuff like that, it is just a fantastic place to be,"" Michael said.

The confluence of factors that led to flush retirement accounts

A stable retirement based on a lifetime of savings and smart decisions is possible — Michael and Connie are examples of that. But it's also a reality that's becoming increasingly rare, especially for lower-earning Americans.

The Government Accountability Office found in a 2023 report that lower-income households age 51 to 64 — those earning about a median of $19,100 — are increasingly less likely to have anything in a retirement account.

Back in 2007, per GAO's calculations of the Survey of Consumer Finances, around 21% of low-income households had a retirement account balance. By 2019, that had fallen to 10%. While losses weren't as profound for those in the middle-income quintile, their retirement account balances did fall slightly from 2007 to 2019. As GAO finds: ""For all but the highest income group, there was no detectable difference between the median balances in 2019 and 2007.""

The decline of one type of account, in particular, could be to blame. In recent decades, the US has shifted away from pensions, in which employers offer consistent payouts to former employees in their post-working years. Now, more American workers have defined contribution plans, like 401(k)s, which rely on workers to contribute funds to grow their coffers.

The share of low-income households with a defined benefit pension also fell by half from 2007 to 2019.

Michael acknowledges that some people have likely worked hard for their whole lives, but didn't have higher-paying jobs — meaning they were able to put away less.

""Retirement could have gone the other way for us. I could have made a few bad decisions and we could have lost a lot of money and it would've been a different scenario in terms of comfort,"" he said.

""We got fortunate with a few investments and it just took off and grew,"" Michael added.

The assets that today's retirees do have are also prospering; 401(k) investments have been bolstered by a soaring stock market, meaning that people cashing in on retirement investments right now are on the winning end of historic S&P 500 highs.

""If we look at someone who had a 401(k) fairly early on, so between roughly 1982 and 2002, we had stock market returns that went fairly high,"" David John, senior strategic policy advisor at the AARP, told BI. He added: ""They managed to build retirement savings at a time where there was both stock market returns but also fairly low inflation.""

Connie opted for a variable account to fund her pension — her employers' contributions went into investments, rather than promising a fixed return each year. While her account lost money some years due to the market, overall, her earnings have still outpaced what she would've had with a simply fixed amount.

""There are a lot less pensions out there these days. That's true,"" Connie said.

And for the current group of retirees with those perks, another thing might be boosting their bottom lines: Boomers are holding onto immensely valuable real estate. Thirty years ago, when today's retirees may have started buying real estate, homes were selling for a median of around $130,000. Today, they're going for nearly $300,000 more.

Today's retirees also still have full Social Security benefits, something that's increasingly imperiled for the next generation of workers who are throwing in the towel. All of that comes as retirement savings become more of an individual onus.

""Essentially, the people who need it the most are the ones who are least likely to have a retirement savings plan or a pension,"" John said.

Some have still been able to achieve this stability, but it's more of an uphill battle

Valerie, 46, is one of the Gen Xers trying to follow in the footsteps of prospering boomers. Valerie, who's based in Seattle, has already retired. According to documentation viewed by BI, she has over a million in her 401(k), but it's been hard-fought. Valerie — a former retail worker — tried to invest in real estate, but ended up on the other end of a hard market: Her properties went into foreclosure during the mortgage crisis, she said, and she ""barely had 20 bucks to survive.""

""I kept thinking of all these other ideas, well, how do I build wealth again? Do I just give up? Is this the end of my life?"" she said. For Valerie, the answer ended up hinging on her 401(k) — she said she'd borrow against it to invest back into the market, and then repay those loans. Now that she has a retirement plan secured, she's more willing to take risks to build more wealth.

""When I was 18 to 19 years old, I remember predicting I'd be where I'm at financially in my retirement account if I didn't touch it and didn't bother it. And sure enough, the calculations are right,"" she said.

Valerie is one data point showing that it's also not all bad news for future retirees, but instead, perhaps more of an uphill battle.

""We have an economy that is changing rapidly and there are going to be opportunities for investment growth and savings and new products. I mean, there's an amazing amount of innovation going on there,"" John said. There is a chance it won't be as easy as it was for someone ""who started investing say in the 1980s or the 1990s and are now reaching the end of their careers,"" he said.

""But yes, going forward, it's still possible.""

“What we found was some stark differences in approaches to investing and mindset toward overall investing,” Michael Pelzar, head of investments at Bank of America Private Bank, told Yahoo Finance.

Market research company Escalent surveyed 1,007 high-net-worth Americans on behalf of Bank of America Private Bank. The respondents, who were divided into a younger cohort (ages 21 to 43) and an older cohort (44 and older), had a minimum of $3 million in investable assets apart from their primary residence.

Here's what Bank of America discovered about the younger investors surveyed:

47% of the younger cohort's portfolios are invested in stocks and bonds. That's much lower than the older cohort (74%).

More younger investors are invested in alternative assets than older investors, and almost all of the younger cohort (93%) said they plan to allocate more to alternatives in the next few years.

Nearly half (49%) of the young cohort own cryptocurrencies, and 38% expressed some interest. Behind real estate, this cohort ranked crypto as the top area for opportunity.

45% of the younger cohort own physical gold as an asset, and another 45% said they are interested in owning it.

Differences in financial outlooks drove the disparities in investment allocations and where investors perceive opportunities to be.

Notably, over 70% of younger wealthy investors no longer think it's possible to achieve above-average investment returns by investing exclusively in a mix of stocks and bonds. In contrast, only 28% of older investors share that view.

Bank of America

Younger investors' skepticism over traditional investments comes as the stock market has ripped higher in 2024. As Myles Udland wrote this week, the S&P 500 (^GSPC) is up 42% since the beginning of 2023, pacing an annualized rate of return near 26%, or almost three times the average 10% yearly return of the index over time.

However, Pelzar saw this difference in viewpoint as “somewhat understandable,” citing the turbulence the younger generation has experienced in their investing lives.

“The younger generation has seen in their investing lives two market crashes … and then over the course of the last few years, they’ve seen an increasing correlation between stocks and bonds,” Pelzar said. “And so that’s really colored their thinking around how they need to allocate assets in order to generate the returns they look for.”

The survey revealed that the younger cohort focused their asset allocation on alternatives, and many expressed plans to allocate even more to these investments in the next few years.

Pelzar said this projected increase is “largely reflective” of the younger cohort’s thoughts on the growth opportunities in the market. Because some of the alternative asset classes are less liquid, Pelzar said this implies that the younger generation is taking a longer-term view.

“You see a much different profile between those two different cohorts, and I think that indicates lessons learned or things we need to be thinking about in terms of the investment landscape going forward,” he said.

These advanced systems can generate original content, streamline time-consuming processes, and automate procedures -- all with a few simple commands. This, in turn, promises to increase productivity and save money, which has companies racing to adopt the next-generation algorithms.

One of the most obvious beneficiaries of this trend is Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA). The company's graphics processing units (GPUs) supply the computational horsepower required to process AI training and inference. However, the investing community is beginning to look beyond the first phase of AI adoption (hardware) to what comes next, which will invariably be AI-infused software. It's estimated that generative AI software sales could soar as much as 18,647% to $280 billion by 2032, according to Bloomberg Intelligence.

While there's little doubt that Nvidia will continue to prosper from its early adoption of AI, another company has decades of experience in the field and is poised to profit as the tidal wave of AI software adoption commences.

An AI pioneer

Palantir Technologies (NYSE: PLTR) established itself as one of the early leaders in the AI revolution more than two decades ago. The company partnered with U.S. government agencies and its allies to develop AI software tools to aid in the war on terror. Its AI-powered data mining systems connected the dots between seemingly unrelated bits of information to helped flush out terrorists. In recent years Palantir has focused its attention on the enterprise sector, providing companies with actionable information to make data-driven decisions.

With decades of experience in the field, Palantir was able to pivot quickly and develop state-of-the-art generative AI tools to help businesses succeed. The company's latest brainchild is its Artificial Intelligence Platform (AIP), which provides users with keen insight to solve everyday business dilemmas.

One Palantir demo video shows the impact of shuttering a production line in the face of an oncoming hurricane. AIP provides suggestions regarding which orders to accelerate, delay, or cancel, which orders can be rerouted to other distribution centers, and how those decisions will affect backlogs and the associated sales. It can also estimate the financial impact of hiring additional trucks to accelerate high-priority deliveries before the storm hits, assessing how this will affect profits.

Most businesses would jump at the opportunity to deploy tools with those capabilities, but the complexity alone would be enough to confound all but the most technologically savvy executives. Palantir addressed the issue by staging AIP boot camps. Developers and executives alike can attend these hands-on sessions, allowing them to build sophisticated applications alongside Palantir engineers and building real-world, company-specific solutions.

Story continues

This strategy has been wildly successful, helping Palantir increase its U.S. commercial customer count by 69% year over year and 19% sequentially in the first quarter. This was largely thanks to AIP bootcamps and the resulting accelerated deal volume.

This helps illustrate the vast potential of Palantir's boot camp strategy.

The proof is in the pudding

The results have only just begun to impact the company's financial results. In the first quarter, revenue of $634 million grew 21% year over year and 4% quarter over year, resulting in Palantir's sixth consecutive quarter of profitability. U.S. commercial revenue, which includes AIP, grew 40% year over year while customers for the segment grew 69%. Remaining deal revenue (RDV), or the remaining value of contracts not yet recorded as revenue, grew 74%.

Management expects the company's growth streak to continue. Palantir increased its full-year outlook and is now expecting revenue of $2.68 billion, representing growth of 20% at the midpoint of its guidance. Perhaps more telling, however, is the expected strong showing from U.S. commercial revenue, which is expected to clock in at least $661 million, an increase of 45%. That's up compared to its guidance of 40% growth issued just last quarter. This suggests there's continuing strong demand for AIP boot camps.

Every rose has its thorns

The company's rapid growth and ties to AI aside, some investors will be put off by Palantir's valuation, which is understandable -- but looks can be deceiving. The stock currently trades for 211 times earnings and 25 times sales, which is enough to make any value investors run for cover. However, rapid growth tends to skew the most commonly used valuation metrics. However, a more useful measure in this case is the forward price/earnings-to-growth (PEG) ratio, which clocks in at 0.79, when anything less than 1 indicates an undervalued stock.

Generative AI is still in the early stages of adoption, and the resulting rollout could take years to accomplish. Palantir is poised to be an early winner in the next phase of the AI revolution thanks to its decades of expertise and brilliant go-to-market strategy.

That's why Palantir stock is a buy.

Yahoo Finance,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/outperform-88-professional-fund-managers-210400950.html,2024-06-29,21:04:00 UTC,You Can Outperform 88% of Professional Fund Managers by Using This Simple Investment Strategy,"Professional fund managers are in charge of investing billions of dollars for investors. They're often highly educated, have years of investment experience, and get paid well for their skills and expertise. But the truth is most aren't worth the fees they charge.

It doesn't take an advanced degree or special insider knowledge to do better than the vast majority of actively-managed mutual funds. A simple strategy can beat about 88% of them. It's a strategy Warren Buffett famously bet half a million dollars on with the expectation it could beat any hedge fund manager over 10 years.

He won the bet.

All you need to do is buy an S&P 500 index fund, such as the Vanguard S&P 500 ETF (NYSEMKT: VOO), and you can expect better long-term returns than most active mutual funds.

Image source: Getty Images.

Why 88% of active large-cap funds can't beat a simple index fund

S&P Global publishes its SPIVA (S&P Indices Versus Active) scorecards twice a year. The scorecard compares the performance of active mutual funds (after fees) to relevant S&P benchmark indexes over periods of one, three, five, 10, and 15 years. It found that 88% of active large-cap funds failed to beat the S&P 500 over the last 15 years as of the end of 2023. Even when you look at a shorter three-year period, about 80% failed to beat the benchmark.

There are a couple of factors that lead to such dismal results for active funds as a group.

First, it's important to consider how the stock market works. There's always someone on either side of a transaction; for every buyer, there's a seller. And among large-cap stocks, the people buying and selling shares are mostly institutional investors. In other words, one fund manager is typically selling their shares to another fund manager. They can't both be right.

Since large institutions make up most of the market, the odds of outperforming the market as an active fund manager may be only a little better than 50/50. But the second factor severely diminishes the returns passed on to investors in actively-managed funds.

Fund managers, their teams, and the institutions they work for all require compensation. That means mutual fund investors have to pay fees. The most common fee is the expense ratio, which captures a portion of the assets under management. Those fees can climb well over 1%. That means the fund manager has to outperform the market by the fee they charge clients just to break even. And that's a lot harder than simply beating the market by a few basis points.

As a result, the percentage of actively-managed mutual funds that outperform the S&P 500 in any given year is only around 40%. And very few can consistently beat the market by enough every year to come out ahead in the long run.

Story continues

Reduce your ""cost of participation""

If you want to outperform the average investor, the key is reducing what Vanguard founder Jack Bogle called ""the cost of participation."" Those are the costs you have to pay to invest your money.

It's become easier and less expensive to invest over the 25-plus years since Bogle coined that term. Portfolio transaction costs are near zero with most brokerages waiving commissions on stock purchases. On average, expense ratios for mutual funds have declined considerably from the mid-90s too. Still, an investor should aim to keep costs as low as possible, and that means avoiding unnecessary fees.

Since active mutual funds cannot outperform their fees, on average, those fees should be deemed unnecessary. You can buy the Vanguard S&P 500 ETF and practically match the market return for a fee of just 0.03%, or $3 for every $10,000 you invest.

And while it's true some fund managers have outperformed their fees for a long time, identifying those funds beforehand is not so simple. What's more, there's no telling whether the results came from skill or luck, so you can't be certain the fund can continue its winning streak.

As a result, your best bet remains an S&P 500 index fund.

What makes the Vanguard S&P 500 ETF Buffett's top pick?

In Buffett's big bet against fund managers, he put his money in the Vanguard S&P 500 index fund. Berkshire Hathaway owns a small amount of the S&P 500 ETF in its equity portfolio as well. There are a few things that make it his top pick.

First, as mentioned, it has an expense ratio of 0.03%. That's one of the best in the industry.

Second, it has a very low tracking error. Tracking error tells you how consistently close (or wide) the ETF tracks the index it's benchmarked to. That can make a big difference for someone investing on a regular schedule. You want the fund to reflect the performance of the index, so your results match the results of the index over the long run. It's not worth sacrificing a low tracking error for a lower expense ratio, especially when the Vanguard fund is so cheap already.

There are many options to choose from, but the Vanguard S&P 500 ETF stands out as a top choice. It's a great option not just among other index funds but among all large-cap stock funds.

Yahoo Finance,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/forget-nvidia-heres-another-spectacular-092100205.html,2024-06-30,09:21:00 UTC,"Forget Nvidia: Here's Another Spectacular Semiconductor Stock to Buy Right Now, According to Wall Street","I'm being facetious when I tell you to forget Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA). After all, how can you ignore a stock that soared nearly tenfold in just 18 months and now has a $3.1 trillion market cap, which accounts for 6.7% of the entire S&P 500 index? Not to mention, the company's chips are the driving force behind artificial intelligence (AI).

However, the incredible run in Nvidia stock made it quite expensive, even relative to its expected earnings a couple of years from now. Nvidia isn't the only chipmaker reaping the rewards of AI, so investors might find better value in other stocks in this space.

Micron Technology (NASDAQ: MU) is one to consider. The overwhelming majority of the analysts tracked by The Wall Street Journal give it the highest possible buy rating, with none recommending selling. Here's why.

Image source: Getty Images.

Micron is catching a tailwind from AI

Nvidia's graphics processing units (GPUs) are critical for AI development. However, memory chips are a key component of those GPUs. They basically give AI models short-term memory, storing data in a ready state where it can be instantly called upon either for training purposes or when a user queries a chatbot.

Micron makes the world's leading HBM3E (HBM stands for high-bandwidth memory) for the data center. HBM3E's architecture provides a higher bandwidth than previous generations of memory (like DDR), while occupying a smaller physical footprint that also consumes less energy. This means mountains of data can be transferred more quickly while reducing electricity costs. Both factors are top of mind for data center operators.

Micron's HBM3E is so efficient that Nvidia is using it in its latest GPUs, including in the new H200, which can inference AI models (ingest live data and make predictions) twice as fast as its flagship H100.

During the recent fiscal 2024 third quarter (ended May 30), Micron said its data center HBM solutions contributed $100 million in revenue. The company expects total HBM revenue to be in the hundreds of millions of dollars at the close of fiscal 2024 (ending Aug. 31), and several billions of dollars in fiscal 2025. In fact, all of Micron's supply is completely sold out for next year already.

But Micron's AI opportunity doesn't stop at the data center, because AI-enabled personal computers (PCs) require up to 80% more memory (DRAM) capacity than traditional PCs. Micron says Microsoft's new Copilot+ AI PC comes with a minimum DRAM content of 16GB, whereas the previous generation came with an 8GB option. Similarly, AI-enabled smartphones require up to double the memory capacity of their predecessors.

Story continues

These trends will lead to more money in the door for Micron.

Micron's revenue is soaring, thanks to AI

Micron generated $6.8 billion in revenue during Q3, representing year-over-year growth of 81%. That marked an acceleration from the prior quarter when revenue grew by 57%, which speaks to how quickly demand for AI is ramping up.

Beneath the surface of the headline number, the results were even more impressive. Micron's compute and networking (data center) business, which is the largest of its four segments, grew revenue by 85% in the last year. Its mobile segment expanded even faster, with revenue soaring by 94% as the world's leading smartphone manufacturers race to integrate AI into their flagship devices.

Micron also delivered a strong result at the bottom line. It generated $0.30 in earnings per share during Q3, which was a big swing from its $1.73 loss per share from the year-ago period. It was also above the high end of management's guidance of $0.24.

As I touched on earlier, supply of products like HBM3E is now sold out until the end of 2025, and those supply constraints give Micron the ability to charge higher prices. It translated to improved profitability in Q3, and that tailwind should persist for at least the next year.

Wall Street is very bullish on Micron stock

Micron stock is up 72% so far this year and trading near an all-time high, but that hasn't deterred Wall Street. The Wall Street Journal tracks 38 analysts covering the stock, and 27 give it the highest possible buy rating. A further seven are in the overweight (bullish camp), and two recommend holding. Although two analysts have assigned Micron an underweight (bearish) rating, none recommend outright selling.

Micron's fiscal year 2024 wraps up in August. Its final earnings result will be compromised by weakness at the start of the year, stemming from an inventory glut in its consumer-oriented segments. But analysts already turned their attention to fiscal 2025, when they expect Micron to deliver $9.06 in earnings per share -- based on its closing stock price of $142.36 on June 26, which places it at a forward price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio of just 15.7.

For perspective, the iShares Semiconductor ETF trades at a P/E ratio of 35.9 today, implying Micron stock will have to more than double within the next year just to trade in line with its peers in the chip industry (assuming Wall Street's earnings forecast is accurate). Plus, Nvidia trades at a forward P/E ratio of 46.6, which makes Micron stock look like an even better value.

Since Micron's HBM3E memory is a key component in many of Nvidia's latest GPUs, any investor who thinks Nvidia will do well should also consider adding Micron to their portfolio, especially at the current price.

Yahoo Finance,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/a-fintech-collapse-is-rippling-through-a-small-corner-of-the-banking-world-143054499.html,2024-06-30,14:30:54 UTC,A fintech collapse is rippling through a small corner of the banking world,"The unraveling of fintech upstart Synapse is rippling through a small corner of the banking world, leaving thousands of customers without access to their money and a mystery about millions of dollars that went missing.

Four small US banks have some of the money. No one is sure where the rest went.

The saga surrounding the bankruptcy of Synapse, a 10-year-old fintech firm, puts a new spotlight on how loose webs of partnerships between venture-backed upstarts and FDIC-backed lenders can go so wrong.

Regulators are more closely scrutinizing these relationships and warning various banks to tighten their controls when working with fintech firms.

Earlier this month, the Federal Reserve slapped one of Synapse’s partner banks with an enforcement action that identified risk management weaknesses surrounding such partnerships.

'Banking as a service'

Synapse was part of a wave of new fintech firms that emerged in the aftermath of the 2008 financial crisis as Silicon Valley-style digital banking upstarts promised to shake up the world of traditional finance.

In just a decade it became a major middleman between dozens of fintech companies and community banks by offering what it called ""banking as a service.""

It provided digital banking outfits like Mercury, Dave (DAVE), and Juno with access to checking accounts and debit cards they could offer their customers. It was able to do this by partnering with FDIC-backed banks that in return got a new source of deposits and fee revenue.

The traditional lenders that partnered with Synapse included Evolve Bank & Trust, American Bank, AMG National Trust, and Lineage Bank, all small banks when compared with giants like JPMorgan Chase (JPM) or Bank of America (BAC).

The largest was Evolve, which had roughly $1.5 billion in assets at the end of the first quarter.

The pitch that Synapse effectively gave to these smaller banks was ""we’ll bring in the deposits; you don’t have to do much,"" according to Jason Mikula, an independent fintech consultant who publishes a weekly newsletter and has followed Synapse.

""This turned out not to be accurate, in my opinion,"" Mikula added.

The problems surfaced shortly after Synapse filed for bankruptcy in April when it could not reach an agreement with Evolve on a settlement of funds.

Three weeks into the bankruptcy proceedings, Synapse cut off Evolve's access to its technology system. That, in turn, forced Evolve and the other partner banks to freeze customer accounts.

Both parties blamed each other as the culprit.

""Synapse’s abrupt shutdown of essential systems without notice and failure to provide necessary records needlessly jeopardized end users by hindering our ability to verify transactions, confirm end user balances, and comply with applicable law,"" Evolve said in a statement.

Story continues

Synapse CEO Sankaet Pathak rebuked this claim, accusing Evolve of having the means to settle a deficit yet delaying the return of customer funds.

""The debtor has been forced to play a perverse game of 'whack-a-mole' with unreasonable demands from Evolve as conditions to unfreezing the depositor accounts, all while the depositors suffer lack of access to their funds,"" Pathak stated in court documents last month.

The end result is that thousands of fintech customers lost access to their money.

“Synapse’s bankruptcy has left tens of thousands of end-users of financial technology platforms that were customers of Synapse stranded without access to their funds,” Jelena McWilliams, the court-appointed trustee to Synapse and a former FDIC chair, wrote in a letter last week to the heads of five federal banking regulators.

There was another problem: No one seemed to know where all of the money was.

McWilliams in early June said there was a shortfall of $85 million, with the four banks only accounting for $180 million of the $265 million belonging to end users.

More recently she said the range of the shortfall was $65 million to $96 million.

Some money has been paid back to customers. McWilliams said on June 21 that more than $100 million ""has been distributed by certain of the partner banks.""

Blind spots

Bank regulators have been concerned for some time about the partnerships between Silicon Valley-style digital startups and FDIC-backed banks.

Acting Comptroller of the Currency Michael Hsu used a September 2023 speech to discuss the potential blind spots for regulators as these relationships become more blurry.

“Banks and tech firms, in an effort to provide a ‘seamless’ customer experience, are teaming up in ways that make it more difficult for customers, regulators, and the industry to distinguish between where the bank stops and where the tech firm starts,” Hsu said in the speech.

Last June, regulators issued final joint guidance on how lenders should handle these relationships.

These partnerships are not yet widespread across the entire banking industry, even though the use of this model is accelerating while banks of all sizes seek ways to attract deposits and earn more revenue.

Fewer than 2% of US banks used the banking-as-a-service model in 2023, according to S&P Global Market Intelligence.

But regulators are nonetheless getting more aggressive about calling out such relationships. The banking-as-a-service model accounted for 13.5% of public enforcement actions from regulators in 2023, according to S&P.

In January, the FDIC issued a consent order to one of Synapse’s partner banks, Franklin, Tenn.-based Lineage, that identified weaknesses related to its banking-as-a-service program and ordered the bank to come up with a plan for how to achieve an ""orderly termination"" with significant fintech partners.

The next month, New York City-based Piermont Bank; Attica, Ohio-based Sutton Bank; and Martinsville, Va.-based Blue Ridge Bank received consent orders from regulators related to alleged deficiencies in their banking-as-a-service business.

Then, earlier this month, the Fed issued an enforcement action against Evolve, saying that examinations conducted in 2023 ""found that Evolve engaged in unsafe and unsound banking practices by failing to have in place an effective risk management framework"" for its partnerships with fintech companies.

Regulators asked Evolve to improve its policies and risk management practices ""by implementing appropriate oversight and monitoring of those relationships."" They also noted that the action was ""independent of the bankruptcy proceedings regarding Synapse.""

A spokesperson for Evolve said the recent order was ""similar to orders received by others in the industry"" and ""does not affect our existing business, customers, or deposits.""

The bank counts Affirm (AFRM), Mastercard (MA), and Stripe as notable fintech partnerships on its website.

It has also in the past partnered with two crypto firms that went bankrupt, FTX and BlockFi, as well as Bytechip, a financial services firm had its accounts with Evolve frozen late last year on the allegation it violated federal law by laundering money for fraudsters.

To add to its recent challenges, Evolve said this past Wednesday that some customer data was illegally spread on the dark web as a result of ""a cybersecurity incident involving a known cybercriminal organization.""

""Evolve has engaged the appropriate law enforcement authorities to aid in our investigation and response efforts,"" the bank said. ""This incident has been contained, and there is no ongoing threat.""

Yahoo Finance,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/spousal-social-security-benefits-3-095000736.html,2024-06-30,09:50:00 UTC,Spousal Social Security Benefits: 3 Things All Retired Couples Should Know,"Married couples share nearly everything -- food, homes, vacations, and more. In some cases, they can even share Social Security retirement benefits.

The Social Security program has included spousal benefits since its beginning in the 1930s. Here are three things all retired couples should know about spousal Social Security benefits.

Image source: Getty Images.

1. Eligibility requirements for spousal benefits

Can you receive Social Security retirement benefits based on your spouse's work record? Only if you meet specific eligibility requirements.

First, you usually must be married to your spouse for at least one year before you can receive Social Security spousal benefits. This doesn't apply, however, if you are the parent of your spouse's child. Ex-spouses may also be eligible for spousal benefits if they were married for at least 10 years.

Second, you'll need to be at least 62 years old to claim spousal benefits with a couple of exceptions. If you provide care for a child age 16 or younger, the age requirement is waived. That's also the case if you provide care for a child age 17 or older with a disability who is entitled to receive Social Security dependent benefits based on your spouse's record.

Third, your spousal benefit can't be higher than the amount you'd receive based on your own earnings history. If it isn't, the Social Security Administration (SSA) will pay you based on your own work record rather than your spouse's.

2. Potential spousal benefit amount

The maximum spousal benefit is 50% of the higher-earning spouse's primary insurance amount (PIA). The PIA is the amount of the higher-earning spouse's benefit at their full retirement age. For anyone born in 1960 or later, the full retirement age is 67.

Spouses won't receive this maximum benefit, though, if they begin collecting benefits before their own full retirement age. The Social Security early retirement penalty will be imposed with benefits reduced by five-ninths of 1% for each month up to 36 months before reaching full retirement age and five-twelfths of 1% for each month before then. However, if a spouse is providing care for a qualifying child, the spousal benefit won't be reduced.

Note that the spousal benefit isn't based on when the higher-earning spouse begins collecting retirement benefits. If this spouse retires early or holds off until age 70, it won't change the amount of the spousal benefit. However, it would impact the survivor's benefit if he or she dies.

3. Deemed filing

The Bipartisan Budget Act of 2015 made an important change often referred to as the ""deemed filing"" rule that affects Social Security spousal benefits. Deemed filing means when individuals file for spousal benefits, they also must file simultaneously for their own retirement benefits. In the past, people could file for spousal benefits before reaching their full retirement age but hold off on filing for their own retirement benefits until they reached full retirement age.

Story continues

However, the deemed filing rule doesn't apply if you receive spousal benefits because you're providing care for your retired spouse's qualifying child. It also doesn't apply to survivor benefits. If your spouse dies, you can begin receiving Social Security survivor benefits without filing for your retirement benefit.

The $ 22,924 Social Security bonus most retirees completely overlook

If you're like most Americans, you're a few years (or more) behind on your retirement savings. But a handful of little-known ""Social Security secrets"" could help ensure a boost in your retirement income. For example: one easy trick could pay you as much as $22,924 more... each year! Once you learn how to maximize your Social Security benefits, we think you could retire confidently with the peace of mind we're all after.

Yahoo Finance,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/sizzling-summer-3-top-dividend-125300260.html,2024-06-30,12:53:00 UTC,Sizzling Summer: 3 Top Dividend Stocks to Buy to Cash in on Red-Hot Power Demand,"A heat wave has gripped much of the country this summer. That has people cranking up their ACs to cool down, which is boosting power demand. The rise in power consumption and prices will likely raise the average power bill by about 3% this year compared to last summer.

The current heat isn't the only factor driving up power demand. The increasing electrification of the transportation sector, growth in power-hungry data centers (especially for AI), and other catalysts have the country on track to see a surge in power demand through the end of the decade.

Instead of sweating the heat wave (and rising future power prices), you can cash in on red-hot demand for power. Dominion Energy (NYSE: D), NextEra Energy (NYSE: NEE), and Duke Energy (NYSE: DUK) stand out to a few Fool.com contributors as great ways to potentially generate lots of dividend income from growing power demand.

Dominion Energy is a high-yield work-in-progress

Reuben Gregg Brewer (Dominion Energy): To get the bad news out up front, Dominion Energy's dividend won't be growing for a few years. That's because the company has just completed a corporate overhaul that includes selling natural gas utility assets so that it can focus on its electric utility business. Also in this mix is the goal of shoring up the company's balance sheet and reducing its payout ratio to be more in line with peers.

Thus, no dividend growth for now. But you will be paid very well to wait for Dominion's dividend to start growing again via the stock's attractive 5.4% dividend yield. That's well above the utility average of around 3%. However, the real attraction here is the markets Dominion serves in the Southeastern United States, which includes one of the world's fastest-growing data center markets.

To put some numbers on this, Dominion added 94 data centers to the grid over the past five years and expects to add another 15 in 2024. And there will be more to come in the future. Data centers use a tremendous amount of electricity and support the long-term demand growth that will help Dominion get its capital spending plans and rate requests approved by regulators.

Longer term, Dominion is projecting earnings growth of between 5% and 7%. And once the company has solidified its finances, dividend growth will likely resume and track earnings growth. So, you get a high yield today and a growing dividend tomorrow.

Cashing in on the summer's Sun

Matt DiLallo (NextEra Energy): NextEra Energy has multiple ways to cash in on rising power demand. The company operates the country's largest electric utility (Florida Power & Light, or FPL), which provides electricity to about 5.9 million customers in Florida. It also owns one of the world's biggest clean energy businesses (NextEra Energy Resources), which supplies electricity to other utilities and large corporate buyers.

Story continues

FPL benefits from higher electricity demand when customers crank up the AC on hot summer days. It also benefits from its ability to harness the Sun's power to produce electricity. Last quarter alone, it added more than 1.6 gigawatts (GW) of new, cost-effective solar energy. FPL now owns and operates 6.4 GW of solar, the largest utility-scale solar portfolio in the country. The utility's low-cost solar operations are one reason its customers don't sweat heatwaves (their bills are 37% below the national average).

NextEra's energy resources segment is well-positioned to meet the country's growing demand for power. While it primarily sells electricity under long-term, fixed-rate power purchase agreements, rising prices will enable it to lock in higher rates as legacy contracts expire. Growing power demand also enables NextEra to build more renewable energy capacity.

The company expects strong, rising power demand to drive 6% to 8% adjusted earnings-per-share growth through 2027. That should give it the fuel to increase its dividend, which it has done every year for three decades. It currently expects to grow its payout by around 10% annually through at least 2026. That's a robust growth rate for a payout that already yields an above-average 2.8% (more than double the S&P 500's 1.3 % yield).

Duke Energy has the power to potentially generate strong returns

Neha Chamaria (Duke Energy): Duke Energy is among the largest electric utilities in the U.S., with a customer base of nearly 8.2 million across six states. Importantly, some of these are among the fastest-growing states in the U.S., including Florida, North Carolina, and South Carolina. Florida and South Carolina were, in fact, the two fastest-growing states in the U.S. in 2023, clocking 1.6% and 1.7% growth, respectively, according to the U.S. Census Bureau.

Duke Energy projects 1.5% to 2% annual growth across all its jurisdictions between 2023 and 2028, driven by economic growth led by high-potential industries like artificial intelligence, chip manufacturing, data centers, electric vehicles, automakers, and pharmaceuticals. Florida and the Carolinas were also among the leading states in terms of migration last year, which partly explains why Duke Energy added 195,000 new customers in 2023, also its largest ever.

Duke Energy's profile alone, therefore, positions it well to benefit from a potential surge in power demand. The company isn't resting on its laurels, though -- it plans to invest a whopping $73 billion to expand and modernize its infrastructure through 2028 to grow its rate base steadily. The utility expects its investments to boost adjusted earnings per share by 5% to 7% through 2028, which should also support dividend growth.

The stock yields 4% today, and the utility believes it should be able to maintain its yield in the coming years. Overall, that makes Duke Energy a compelling stock to buy if you want to cash in on rising power demand.

Yahoo Finance,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/senator-questioning-plug-powers-government-160700242.html,2024-06-30,16:07:00 UTC,"With a Senator Questioning Plug Power's Government Loan, Is This an Opportunity to Buy the Stock?","Shares of Plug Power (NASDAQ: PLUG) surged in May after the company announced that it had received a conditional commitment for a $1.66 billion loan from the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE). However, the stock is now well below where it was before the announcement, and one U.S. senator has called the loan into question.

The stock, meanwhile, is now down over 70% in the past year.

Let's look at the proposed DOE loan, why it is being called into question, why it is so important for Plug Power, and whether the slide in the stock is a buying opportunity.

Fixing a flawed business model

Plug Power has long been grappling with a flawed business model, which it has set out to fix. The company initially found a niche selling fuel cells used in forklifts and other material-handling equipment to companies with high-volume, three-shift warehouses like Amazon and Walmart.

But the flaw in its business model was that it would sell the hydrogen fuel needed to run its fuel cells at a loss. This could be seen in the company's most recent results, where negative gross margin led to a $159 million gross loss.

Just to emphasize how bad this is, the loss was measured before any corporate costs. The company loses a lot of money on the hydrogen fuel it sells, although in the first quarter, it also lost money on the equipment it sold.

Obviously, acquiring or making something for $3 and then selling it for $1 is not a durable business model, but that is pretty close to what Plug Power did last quarter with hydrogen fuel. Over the years, the company has mostly obtained hydrogen from third parties and sold it to its customers at a huge loss.

This is why it has embarked on building a network of its own hydrogen plants that can produce fuel that it can sell to its customers for a profit.

This is where the DOE loan comes in. In May, the company was given the chance to secure the loan -- if certain conditions to be negotiated by the company and the government are met -- to help it build out its hydrogen plant network. If it is approved, the loan would help fund up to six green hydrogen production facilities.

Plug Power already has two plants up and running, and another is expected to be complete by the end of the year, and that would meet about 65% of where it sees demand headed.

The loan would help create a large plant in Texas scheduled for next year that would meet its customer needs and allow it to expand beyond that.

However, in June, Sen. John Barrasso, a Republican from Wyoming who is the ranking member of the Senate Committee on Energy and Natural Resources, asked the DOE's inspector general to investigate ""any potential impropriety"" by the the DOE’s Loan Programs Office and the loan program's director, Jigar Shah, due to possible conflicts of interest. The senator also questioned Plug Power's viability given its $1.4 billion in losses last year.

Story continues

While Plug Power could pursue financing elsewhere if the loan ultimately does not get approved, the terms and interest rates would undoubtedly be much less favorable. And given the company's financial position and negative operating cash flow, there is no guarantee it would be able to find an institution to lend it the money.

Is the sell-off a buying opportunity?

Plug Power shares shot up as much as 70%, to $4.90, in the day after the DOE loan offer was announced. Today it is trading more than 15% below where it was before the announcement.

If the loan is approved, there should be some immediate upside potential given the past reaction and where the stock now trades. However, that could be short-lived.

Plug Power, meanwhile, has said it is looking to get to gross margin breakeven in its fuel business in the fourth quarter, which would not be dependent on the loan. That is a potential catalyst, but a break-even gross margin is still not a complete solution because it will not make the company profitable or start generating cash.

At this point, I would view Plug Power more like a lottery ticket. If it gets the loan, builds out its plants, and turns positive in gross margin and free cash flow, there could be tremendous upside in the stock. But just like most lottery tickets, there is also the chance it becomes worthless.

Yahoo Finance,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/want-1-000-super-safe-072500567.html,2024-06-29,07:25:00 UTC,"Want $1,000 in Super-Safe Dividend Income? Buy $11,862 of This Ultra-High-Dividend Yield Stock","Investors love tobacco stocks because of their high dividend yields and growing dividend payouts. Long-term shareholders in these companies have made a fortune by simply holding and watching the dividend payments pile up in their accounts.

Today, Altria Group (NYSE: MO) has a dividend yield of 8.43%. The United States-focused tobacco giant can generate $1,000 in annual dividend income for investors who buy $11,862 worth of stock right now. But is this dividend sustainable? Is Altria Group a safe dividend stock today?

I think it is. Here's why Altria Group is a smart play for investors looking to build a diversified dividend income portfolio.

Volume declines, but rising new categories

Altria Group owns the U.S. brand of Marlboro, which is the top premium cigarette in the country with around 40% market share. This dominance has been retained for decades. However, investors are worried about accelerating overall volume declines in the cigarette category, which has caused stocks such as Altria to underperform the market.

For example, last quarter Altria estimated that cigarette volumes declined by 9% year over year for the entire U.S. market. Despite this, the company's net revenue for smokeable products only declined by 2.3%, with segment operating profit declining by a similar amount as well. While this isn't an ideal situation, Altria has been able to raise prices to counteract volume declines for decades to maintain profits.

Smokeable products are the majority of Altria's $11.4 billion in operating profits today, but they're increasingly getting replaced by new nicotine products in vaping and nicotine pouches. The company's recent acquisition of the Njoy brand has a market share of 4.3%, which grew by 0.6 percentage points last quarter. Now, the U.S. government and law enforcement are increasing crackdowns on illegal vaping devices, which should help Njoy greatly increase market share.

On top of this, the On! nicotine pouch brand grew shipment volumes by 32% year over year last quarter. It is still a tiny part of the brand portfolio but should continue to grow quickly. It might help too that the largest competitor in nicotine pouches, Zyn, is seeing supply shortages in the United States right now.

The dividend is not only safe, but can grow

Recent 9% volume declines and a 2% decrease in profits for the smokeable category are concerning for investors. However, running the math on Altria's dividend payout shows the 8%+ dividend yield is here to stay.

Over the last 12 months, Altria has paid a dividend per share of $3.88. Free cash flow per share -- the fuel for dividend payments -- was $5 and has been consistently above the dividend per share for the last five years. Altria is also reducing its shares outstanding through a stock buyback program, which has brought shares outstanding down by a cumulative 8% in the last five years.

Story continues

Having 8% fewer shares means an 8% lower cumulative dividend payout while maintaining the same dividend per share level. It also helps free cash flow per share grow, even if nominal free cash flow is flat. So, even if Altria's earnings stagnate due to heavy volume declines, the company has plenty of room to grow its dividend per share due to the wide spread between its dividend payout and free cash flow along with the consistent buyback program.

MO Dividend Yield Chart

Is the stock a buy?

With such a high dividend yield, I think contrarian investors looking to build retirement income are smart to buy Altria Group stock today. Its dividend yield has gone from less than 4% to over 8% in the last 10 years as the stock has suffered. But the business is still in fine shape and has the earnings power to maintain a growing dividend over the next five years and beyond.

Buying a little over $11,000 of Altria stock can deliver $1,000 in dividend income to your portfolio every year. Investors should remember to diversify their holdings, though. If $11,000 is a large investment for you, start with a smaller amount and build up your dividend income by buying more shares over time. It is never smart to go all in on one stock, as no company is a risk-free investment. The same holds true for Altria and any other tobacco stock.

With investors piling into technology and AI stocks at huge earnings multiples, it may be smart to zig while others are zagging and buy some high-dividend-yield stocks like Altria Group in 2024.

Yahoo Finance,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/june-jobs-report-ushers-in-new-quarter-during-holiday-shortened-trading-week-what-to-know-this-week-123222324.html,2024-06-30,12:32:22 UTC,June jobs report ushers in new quarter during holiday-shortened trading week: What to know this week,"A crucial week of labor market data will greet investors during a holiday-shortened trading week that begins the month of July, the third quarter, and second half of 2024.

The S&P 500 (^GSPC) enters Q3 up 14.5% so far this year, while the Nasdaq Composite (^IXIC) rallied more than 18%. The Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI) gained a more modest 3.8% in the first six months of the year.

With stocks sitting near record highs and recent inflation trends proving more positive, all eyes have turned to the labor market for signs of weakness as the Fed maintains its restrictive interest rate stance.

The June Jobs report will provide a robust look at the labor market on Friday, while updates on private payrolls and job openings will also be in focus throughout the week. Updates on activity in the manufacturing and services sectors will also be scattered throughout the schedule.

Constellation Brands (STZ) is expected to be the focus of the lone notable corporate earnings report during an otherwise quiet week before big banks officially kick off second quarter earnings season the following week.

Markets in the US will close early on July 3 (1 p.m. ET) and will remain closed on July 4 for Independence Day.

A look at the labor market

The June Jobs report is due for release on Friday morning and is expected to show further cooling in the job market.

The report is expected to show that 188,000 nonfarm payroll jobs were added to the US economy last month, with unemployment holding steady at 4%, according to data from Bloomberg. In May, the US economy added 272,000 jobs while the unemployment rate ticked up slightly to 4%.

Bank of America US economist Michael Gapen reasoned a report along these lines would continue to show a labor market that is ""cooling but not cool.""

On Friday, the latest reading of the Fed's preferred inflation gauge showed inflation eased in May as prices increased at their slowest pace since March 2021.

The print was viewed as a step in the right direction for the Federal Reserve's fight against inflation.

Positive trends in inflation, combined with signs of slowing in economic activity, have economists arguing the Fed should be leaning toward cutting interest rates sooner rather than later.

""Emerging signs of softness in the labor market show [Fed] officials also need to be attentive to risks to the full employment side of their mandate,"" Oxford Economics deputy chief US economist Michael Pearce wrote in a note to clients.

Halftime report

Just like 2023, most of 2024's stock market rally has been driven by a few large tech stocks.

Story continues

Midway through the year, more than two thirds of the S&P 500's gains for the year have come from Nvidia (NVDA), Apple (AAPL), Alphabet (GOOG, GOOGL), Microsoft (MSFT), Amazon (AMZN), Meta (META), and Broadcom (AVGO). Nvidia alone has driven nearly one-third of these gains.

Despite some short-lived rallies throughout the year, just two sectors have outperformed the S&P 500 this year: Communications Services and Information Technology. Both are up more than 18% compared to the S&P 500's roughly 15% gain.

This has kept the debate going over whether the second half of the year will bring a broadening of the stock market rally, a hot-button issue on Wall Street.

Morgan Stanley's chief investment officer Mike Wilson recently argued in a research note that given weakening economic data and high interest rates, a true broadening in which sectors unrelated to tech pick up the slack is unlikely to happen.

""Narrow breadth can persist but it's not necessarily a headwind to forward returns in and of itself,"" Wilson said. ""We believe broadening is likely to be limited to high quality/large cap pockets for now.""

More megacap exceptionalism

Most strategists have reasoned that megacap tech companies have led the rally for good reason, given their earnings continue to outperform the market. That's expected to be the case during second quarter earnings as well.

Nvidia, Apple, Alphabet, Microsoft, Amazon, and Meta are expected to grow earnings by a combined 31.7% in the second quarter, per UBS Investment Bank US equity strategist Jonathan Golub.

The S&P 500 itself is expected to grow earnings by a more modest 7.8%.

This means that the lion's share of earnings growth is once again expected to come from Big Tech. And a similar trend has been seen in earnings revisions for the second quarter.

Since March 31, Golub's work shows earnings estimates for the S&P 500 have fallen just 0.1%, far less than the typical 3.3% drop seen on average. This is due in large part to a 3.9% revision upward for the aforementioned six biggest tech companies.

Entering the second half of the year, the debate over whether these Big Tech companies' consistent earnings beats will fall off will remain at center stage.

Yahoo Finance,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/3-ai-stocks-second-half-114000529.html,2024-06-30,11:40:00 UTC,3 AI Stocks for the Second Half of 2024,"The tech bull market sparked by innovations in generative AI in 2023 continued in the first half of 2024. Even when focusing on tech broadly rather than the industry's strongest performers, the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite Index yielded a total return of nearly 19%.

Knowing that, investors may wonder which stocks could lead the way in the second half of the year. While the market offers no guarantees, the last two quarters of the year could be the time when some stocks begin to rise in earnest. In this article, three Motley Fool contributors deliver insights on stocks they believe investors should watch for the remainder of the year.

Alphabet is positioned to leverage its search-market dominance into AI riches

Jake Lerch (Alphabet): My choice is Alphabet (NASDAQ: GOOGL) (NASDAQ: GOOG), the parent company of Google. What I really like about Alphabet is that the company combines two of the most critical features of any outstanding stock: potential, best represented by its artificial intelligence (AI) tools, and results, as seen in its consistent financial performance.

Let's examine its potential first. Regarding AI, the sky is the limit for Alphabet. The company's latest AI-powered personal assistant, Google Assistant, offers many features to help people accomplish more. Through voice commands alone, users can:

Set timers, create lists, and save locations and passwords.

Call, text, and read emails aloud.

Gather local information, such as weather, traffic, and directions.

Answer general questions, such as ""how many grams in an ounce"" or ""what is 18% of $57.""

Find and play music, movies, or podcasts.

Moreover, Alphabet can capitalize on its massive user base. As the most-visited website in the world, Google processes over 8.5 billion searches per day -- about one for every person on the planet. As such, Alphabet has a significant opportunity to make Google Assistant the preferred AI assistant. This could lead to substantial benefits for Alphabet in the future as it explores ways to monetize Google Assistant through a subscription model where users pay a monthly fee for premium features or an advertising model where companies pay to have their products or services recommended by the assistant.

In the meantime, Alphabet can rely on its already established businesses, such as Google Cloud, YouTube, and Android, to keep ""bringing home the bacon."" These businesses show consistent growth and profitability, adding to Alphabet's overall stability and investment potential.

To sum up, Alphabet could be the AI stock to watch in the back half of 2024 -- and beyond. Investors seeking a stock with an unbeatable combination of potential and results would be wise to consider it.

Meta stock isn't done riding the AI wave

Justin Pope (Meta Platforms): Social media giant Meta Platforms (NASDAQ: META) has been on a rocket-like trajectory. Shares have risen 45% since January and are up an astonishing 326% since January 2023 when artificial intelligence began picking up steam. In just 18 months, Meta stock created the magnitude of wealth the broader market generally takes decades to achieve. I understand if people feel skeptical that Meta has more in the tank.

Yet, the fundamentals indicate that Meta could ride its current momentum through the latter half of this year. That's driven primarily by strong operating performance and a stock valuation that's still borderline cheap. Meta's core business is advertising to its billions of social media users. Meta impressively still gains users even though so many people already use its apps. Meta's family of apps, which include Facebook, Instagram, and WhatsApp, grew to 3.24 billion daily active users in the first quarter, a 7% year-over-year jump.

Digital advertising continues to take market share away from older media formats like television and print, so Meta is also enjoying tailwinds there. Meta's ad volume was up 20% year over year in Q1. Lastly, Meta has started using AI to help companies advertise more efficiently, which helped increase Meta's price per ad by 6% in Q1. In other words, Meta benefits from multiple variables boosting its primary business.

Investors will need to see how Meta continues to perform in future quarters. Analysts are very optimistic; 2024 earnings-per-share estimates of $20.16 would represent 35.5% growth over 2023. Meanwhile, analysts believe Meta will grow earnings by an average of over 19% annually for the next three to five years. Given that healthy growth outlook, Meta stock remains arguably cheap at a forward price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio of 25.

Meta is a world-class business that experienced severe adversity in 2022. The comeback has created eye-popping returns. While Meta's meteoric rise means there's probably far less upside than before, investors shouldn't jump ship too soon. There is still plenty of wind in its sails.

In the AI chip space, a rising tide could lift AMD

Will Healy (Advanced Micro Devices): Given Nvidia's dominance in the AI chip space, potential competitors are easy to dismiss at first glance.

However, according to Allied Market Research, the AI chip industry is expected to grow at a 38% compound annual growth rate (CAGR) through 2032. With Nvidia apparently struggling to meet current demand, it leaves an opening for competitors such as Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ: AMD).

Even though Nvidia leads in the innovation battle, AMD has a history of catching up to and sometimes surpassing its competitors. Moreover, while a Nvidia AI chip costs around $30,000 to $40,000, AMD's $10,000 to $15,000 semiconductors will likely appeal to customers who are anxious to snap up any AI chips they can find.

More recently, investors largely overlooked AMD as its revenue of $5.5 billion in Q1 2024 grew by only 2% yearly. However, data-center revenue of $2.3 billion rose 80% over the same period. Moreover, it made up 42% of the company's overall revenue, a level comparable to Nvidia's percentage of data-center revenue at the end of fiscal 2022 (ended Jan. 30, 2022) of 39%.

Fast forward to fiscal 2025 Q1 (ended April 28), and 87% of Nvidia's revenue came from its data center segment. With AMD's aforementioned 80% data-center growth, Nvidia's recent history shows how AMD could follow in its footsteps as AI chips become its dominant source of revenue.

Also, thanks mostly to AI chips, Nvidia's revenue grew 262% yearly in that quarter. Although AMD may or may not match that number over time, Nvidia's recent history describes what could happen to AMD's revenue growth as its AI chip sales accelerate.

Additionally, AMD holds a significant valuation advantage if looking beyond its misleading P/E ratio of 232. The company currently trades at a price-to-book value ratio of around 4.5. In comparison, Nvidia sells at 63 times its book value. This differential makes AMD stock a relative bargain, giving the stock room to run as the sale of AI chips becomes a more critical revenue stream.

Yahoo Finance,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/dividend-stock-down-37-ready-134500489.html,2024-06-30,13:45:00 UTC,This Dividend Stock Is Down 37%: Is It Ready to Skyrocket?,"While many investors want the stocks that they own to soar in price over time, there are some market participants who appreciate the passive income that their holdings throw off on a consistent basis. Starbucks (NASDAQ: SBUX) might catch the attention of these folks.

The world's leading coffee enterprise has paid a steadily rising dividend since 2010. The current yield sits at a healthy 2.9%. The only issue is that this stock is down 37% from its peak price, which was hit in July 2021.

Might Starbucks shares be ready to skyrocket again?

Hitting a rough patch

The company's stock performance in recent years might cause you to scratch your head. That's because fiscal 2023 revenue of $36 billion was 24% higher than the coffee chain generated in 2021, with operating income up 21% over that two-year stretch. Unsurprisingly, the business took a hit during the pandemic's height, but it has since been on a solid recovery path.

However, shares have been on a downswing in the past 14 months, and they immediately dipped 16% following the second-quarter 2024 (ended March 31) financial update. It's not hard to figure out why.

During the 13-week period, same-store sales declined 3% in the U.S., which is the company's most important market. This was driven by a troubling 7% drop in transaction counts. In the huge China market, it's a worse situation as same-store sales tanked 11%. CEO Laxman Narasimhan called this a ""challenging operating environment"" as consumers become more selective with their spending.

Scaring investors even more was the fact that management lowered guidance for fiscal 2024. It now expects revenue to increase by low single digits, down from a prior range of 7% to 10%.

Favorable qualities

It's not encouraging for shareholders to see Starbucks in this state. But for long-term investors, it's important to stay focused on the company's favorable qualities, of which there are many.

For starters, Starbucks has a wide economic moat, stemming from its brand strength, that protects its competitive position. There is something about Starbucks that has differentiated it and allowed it to resonate with consumers. It's hard to quantify a brand's status. But I think the fact that the company has typically been able to grow same-store sales through higher prices and foot traffic over long stretches of time demonstrates it has something special.

Plus, it helps that Starbucks' average gross margin over the past 10 years, for example, is a superb 28.2%. This might go overlooked, but Starbucks is a consistently profitable and financially sound enterprise. Ongoing positive earnings and free cash flow are precisely what help the business fund its dividend payouts.

Story continues

And the expansion isn't finished. As of March 31, there were nearly 39,000 Starbucks locations scattered across the globe. That's a ridiculously large figure. However, management believes there is still a sizable growth runway going forward. By 2030, the goal is to have a whopping 55,000 locations open, at which point sales and earnings will be much higher than they are today.

Low market expectations

Investors have clearly soured on Starbucks. The shares have taken a hit because there's uncertainty as to when things will start to improve.

But this pessimism creates a buying opportunity for those who can look out over the next three to five years. Starbucks trades at a price-to-sales ratio of under 2.5 right now. Shares have basically never been cheaper in the past decade.

To be clear, I'm not entirely sure that the stock will skyrocket. However, based on the company's positive attributes, I'm optimistic about this investment working out well for buyers.

Yahoo Finance,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/celsius-stock-nasdaq-celh-recover-231008379.html,2024-06-29,23:10:08 UTC,Will Celsius Stock (NASDAQ:CELH) Recover? My Thoughts as a Soft-Drink Business Owner,"Celsius Holdings (NASDAQ:CELH) stock has taken a hammering in recent months after Morgan Stanley (NYSE:MS), quoting the latest Nielsen data, suggested that the growth-focused firm had lost market share. This has been compounded by additional data inferring that further incremental gains in the energy drinks market may be challenging. I’m neutral on Celsius because despite liking the brand, the stock looks a little expensive to me.

Is There a Market for Celsius?

While I’m actually a founder of my own health-focused soft drinks business, it’s a million miles away from a company like Celsius. However, it’s certainly interesting to see Celsius develop its niche and gain market share.

Celsius positions itself as a healthier alternative to traditional soft drinks, offering beverages made with natural ingredients and caffeine sourced from nature. Emphasizing its commitment to healthy living, the company produces drinks without added sugars, aligning with current consumer trends.

In recent years, Celsius has capitalized on the growing demand for healthier beverage options. This is appealing to those seeking a more natural and refreshing way to stay energized and hydrated.

However, there’s a caveat. Celsius replaces the sugar with things like the artificial sweetener sucralose. For context, when I made my health-focused soft drink — it’s called Sumacqua — I decided I’d rather have some sugar from natural sources like grape juice — which is high in polyphenols — rather than artificial ingredients.

Nonetheless, many people in the industry still see this as an improvement on traditional sugar-heavy canned drinks like cola, which are partially responsible for the widespread nature of diabetes. Celsius also claims to create metabolically positive drinks. These claims are only possible if you have the research to back it up.

In short, there appears to be great scope for growth. Celsius is operating in growing markets, with the healthy drinks market expected to grow from $344.36 billion in 2023 to $408.8 billion by 2028. However, it’s worth noting that Celsius doesn’t necessarily fall into this category; it is often referred to as an energy+ drink (an energy drink designed to boost metabolism and burn fat).

Data Turns on Celsius

On May 15, Morgan Stanley reported that Celsius saw a minor market share dip from 10.8% to 10.5% based on Nielsen data. In turn, this led to a swift sell-off and arguably one that was justified. At 100x earnings and 20x sales, the stock was priced for perfection. For context, I was told by private equity that if my business hit $1 million in sales in a year, it would be valued on a price-to-sales (P/S) ratio of three to five.

Story continues

Moreover, Truist analyst Bill Chappell has suggested that while few companies make it above 10% market share, incremental gains from here on will be challenging. Chappell noted that further growth may necessitate converting loyal customers of Monster (NASDAQ:MNST) and Red Bull.

What Do the Forecasts Say About Celsius?

Celsius is expected to register earnings per share (EPS) of $1.08 in 2024, and that then rises dramatically to $1.45 in 2025 and $1.99 in 2026. This is impressive growth for a company that’s not operating in a fast-moving sector like technology or biotech. Looking beyond 2026, the number of analysts offering forecasts falls to just one. The singular analysts suggest that Celsius’s EPS will rise to $4.84 by 2033.

So, what do these earnings projections mean for valuation metrics? Well, Celsius is currently trading at 51.69x non-GAAP forward earnings. This price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio then falls to 38.64x in 2025 and 28.07x in 2026. The TTM P/S ratio has fallen to 9.4x, and the forward ratio sits at 7.9x.

According to the forecasts, earnings are expected to grow at a CAGR of around 28.8% over the next five years. Given the 51.69x non-GAAP forward P/E, Celsius does look a little expensive. The price-to-earnings-to-growth (PEG) ratio sits at 1.8x.

Is Celsius Stock a Buy, According to Analysts?

On TipRanks, CELH comes in as a Moderate Buy based on nine Buys, four Holds, and zero Sell ratings assigned by analysts in the past three months. The average Celsius Holdings stock price target is $80.33, implying a 40.7% downside potential.

The Bottom Line on Celsius Stock

I like Celsius’s brand, and I think they’re taking the industry in the right direction. Very few companies have successfully taken on the soft drinks market with a healthier alternative to the legacy brands producing forms of lemonade and cola. However, I do wonder, as noted by Truist analyst Chappell, whether incremental gains will be harder to come by from here on.

Equally, I believe the company is a little on the expensive side, even considering the strong earnings trajectory. This is highlighted by the PEG ratio of 1.8x. Personally, I’m already over-invested in the sector, given my attempts to start my own soft drinks company. But if I weren’t, I probably wouldn’t be investing in Celsius. While it’s a promising company, I’m neutral on the stock.

Yahoo Finance,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/walgreens-stock-collapses-weak-outlook-091100390.html,2024-06-30,09:11:00 UTC,Walgreens Stock Collapses on Weak Outlook. Is Now the Time to Buy?,"Share prices of Walgreens Boots Alliance (NASDAQ: WBA) plunged following the June 27 release of its fiscal third-quarter earnings report, with the stock having one of its worst days on record. The stock price has now fallen more than 53% since the start of 2024.

Let's look at Walgreens' most recent quarterly report, why the stock plummeted, and whether now is the time to buy.

Reduced guidance, store closures, and new plan

For its fiscal Q3 (ended in May), Walgreens saw its revenue rise 2.6% year over year to $36.4 billion. However, adjusted earnings per share (EPS) fell 36.5% to $0.63. U.S. retail pharmacy sales rose 2.3% year over year, with same-store sales up 3.5%. Comparable pharmacy sales were up 5.7%, while comparable retail sales were down 2.3%. Adjusted operating income plunged 47.9% year over year to $501 million, hurt by weak retail sales and pharmacy reimbursement pressures.

International sales rose 2.8% year over year. Boots UK sales grew 1.6%, with retail same-store sales up 6% and pharmacy same-store sales up 5.8%. Adjusted operating income slid 15.8% year over year to $175 million.

Revenue from its U.S. healthcare segment rose 7.6% year over year to $2.1 billion, with adjusted earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization (EBITDA) of $23 million, an improvement from negative $113 million a year ago. VillageMD revenue grew 7% year over year, while Shields revenue jumped 24%.

Gross margins fell to 17.8% from 18.6% a year ago. Gross margins in its U.S. retail pharmacy business fell to 17.7% from 19.1%. This shows how the company continues to get squeezed from pharmacy benefit managers over drug prices.

Walgreens generated negative $314 million in operating cash flow through the first nine months of the year and negative $1.4 billion in free cash flow. It ended the quarter with $8.9 billion in debt and $703 million in cash.

Looking ahead, the company reduced its fiscal full-year adjusted EPS outlook to $2.80 to $2.95 from a prior forecast of $3.20 to $3.35. Management expects the challenging consumer environment and muted script volume growth it is seeing to continue into 2025.

As a result, the company plans to close a ""significant portion"" of its 8,700 U.S. locations over the next three years, with it set to examine about 25% of its unprofitable locations. The company also said it will make investments to improve customer and patient experience, such as accelerating its digital and omnichannel offerings, building its loyalty program, and reducing the number of brands and SKUs on its shelves.

Story continues

The company also plans to reduce its stake in VillageMD and no longer be its majority owner. However, it plans to keep its positions in Shields and Boots UK.

The company also remains in talks with pharmacy benefit managers (PBMs) and health issuers about creating a better reimbursement system that will help stabilize its pharmacy margins and ensure fair payment.

Is this dip an opportunity to buy the stock?

Reimbursement rate pressures that continue to hurt Walgreens' margins and lower profitably remain its biggest problem. Shifting to a cost-plus model, where it would get additional payments when it can help slow the inflationary costs on drug prices, would greatly benefit the company. It would also help relieve the constant drug reimbursement pressure it has seen year in and year out.

However, while Walgreens is actively working with PBMs and other payers to change the model, this won't happen overnight. And the PBMs have clearly shown that they hold the upper hand.

In the meantime, it is a good idea to sell off some of its VillageMD stake, as this was a failed investment idea that stemmed from the company's previous management team. Closing unprofitable stores is also the right move. Walgreen's balance sheet is loaded with debt, so paying off debt and returning to positive free cash flow is a priority.

Trading at about a 4 times forward price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio, Walgreens finds itself in the bargain bin. However, its debt load, lack of operating cash flow generation, and weakening operating performance are reasons the stock is trading at the current levels.

WBA PE Ratio (Forward) Chart

For patient investors, Walgreens is worth taking a chance on at current levels. The stock is cheap, and the company's new CEO is now looking to make his imprint on the pharmacy giant. Given its valuation, if he can stabilize its pharmacy margins and improve its cash flow profile, the company has a lot of turnaround potential. However, a turnaround is going to take a while, and as such, it may take time for investors to be rewarded for their patience.

Yahoo Finance,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/avoid-social-security-tax-torpedo-160018318.html,2024-06-30,16:00:05 UTC,How to Avoid the Social Security 'Tax Torpedo',"A senior couple dealing with unexpected Social Security taxes, commonly referred to as the Social Security tax torpedo.

While retirees may be chagrined to discover that taxes don’t end when they leave the workforce, an unseen threat looms behind the U.S. tax code. The Social Security tax torpedo is as destructive as it sounds, blowing up the budgets of unsuspecting retired folks eagerly awaiting their first Social Security check. Having a clear understanding of your Social Security taxes could help you dodge this torpedo in retirement. Here’s what you need to know.

A financial advisor can help you create a financial plan to minimize your taxes in your golden years.

What Is Social Security Tax Torpedo?

The Social Security tax torpedo is a spike in taxes retirees can experience after receiving Social Security income. Specifically, 50% to 85% of your Social Security check may be taxable, depending on your income level and life circumstances. In addition, your Social Security income can increase your marginal tax rate, meaning the top portion of your income enters the next tax bracket. As a result, unsuspecting retirees can pay heavier taxes than anticipated, and their Social Security benefits provide less of a financial boost than expected.

Tax Torpedo Implications

The government bases your taxes in retirement on your modified adjusted gross income plus any nontaxable interest (usually from municipal bonds) and half of your Social Security benefits. The resulting sum is called your ‘combined income,’ which incurs different taxes depending on the amount and the filer’s status.

For instance, single filers with a combined income of $25,000 to $34,000 pay taxes on 50% of their benefits. An income above this amount results in taxes on 85% of the benefits. Likewise, those married filing jointly with combined incomes between $32,000 and $44,000 will pay taxes on 50% of their benefits. Any amount above this incurs taxes on 85% of the benefits.

Remember, the tax torpedo doesn’t mean you will lose 85% of your Social Security income taxes. Instead, you’ll owe your regular income tax rate on 85 cents of every dollar you receive from Social Security. In addition, your income tax rate isn’t the same across all your income because of how tax brackets work. The US tax code incurs progressive taxes on your income the higher it is.

For example, say you’re a single filer in 2023 with a total taxable income of $50,000 (putting you in the 22% tax rate for the income above $44,725). Your combined income is $35,000, and you receive $15,000 in Social Security benefits. You’re over the $34,000 combined income limit, meaning you’ll pay taxes on 85% of your Social Security benefits.

Story continues

This situation means applying your top marginal tax rate (22%) to 85% of your Social Security benefit ($12,750). So, your tax burden from Social Security is a $2,805 expense. If your combined income was $34,000 or less, only half your Social Security would be taxed, a $1,650 expense.

A financial advisor can help you navigate Social Security and the applicable taxes in your situation. Get matched with a financial advisor today.

How to Avoid the Social Security Tax Torpedo

A senior calculating his taxes to avoid the Social Security tax torpedo.

Losing your hard-earned Social Security benefits to Uncle Sam isn’t a foregone conclusion. Here’s how to sidestep the Social Security tax torpedo while maximizing your financial wellness and quality of life:

Use a Roth IRA

Roth IRAs are retirement accounts where contributions are made with after-tax dollars, meaning you don’t get a tax deduction when you contribute. However, the distributions during retirement are tax-free. As a result, your Roth IRA income doesn’t count towards your taxable income, reducing the likelihood that you’ll pass the threshold that determines whether 50% or 85% of your Social Security benefit is taxed.

Live in a Tax-Friendly State

Thirteen states tax your Social Security check, adding to the federal tax burden. As a result, you can save on taxes by avoiding residency in the following states:

Colorado

Connecticut

Kansas

Minnesota

Missouri

Montana

Nebraska

New Mexico

North Dakota

Rhode Island

Utah

Vermont

Washington

Give Your IRA Income to Charity

Qualified charitable distributions (QCDs) allow you to donate money directly from your traditional IRA to charity. The government doesn’t count the first $100,000 of donations as taxable income. While doing so won’t directly affect your Social Security tax, it will lower your overall taxable income, potentially reducing the portion of your Social Security benefits subject to taxation. Remember, this advantage is solely for traditional IRAs.

Buy a Qualified Longevity Annuity Contract (QLAC)

A QLAC is a specialized annuity that provides a guaranteed income stream later in life. You can transfer $130,000 from a traditional IRA or 401(k) to a newly opened QLAC, reducing the required minimum distributions (RMDs) you’ll take from your retirement account. This way, the distributions from your 401(k) or IRA won’t increase your annual income as much, mitigating Social Security taxes.

Your QLAC has a delayed RMD age compared to traditional retirement accounts. While the government requires RMDs from a 401(k) or IRA at age 73, you can delay distributions from your QLAC until you’re 85. Remember, you will owe taxes from QLAC distributions the year you receive them.

Compare Your Income Level to Tax Brackets

Understanding the income thresholds for different tax brackets can help you plan withdrawals from retirement accounts. By staying within lower tax brackets, you may reduce the portion of your Social Security benefits subject to taxation.

Delay Social Security

Taxes on Social Security income can’t apply until you receive your benefits. Therefore, delaying Social Security can help you avoid additional taxation through your 60s. If you can work or survive on other income until age 70, you’ll reap two benefits: first, you’ll maximize your Social Security payment amount. Second, you’ll avoid paying taxes on Social Security. Plus, if you live on a traditional IRA or 401(k) during that time, you’ll reduce your RMDs, giving you more control over your income level in your 70s.

Consider speaking with a financial advisor if you're interested in building a tax-efficient retirement plan.

Bottom Line

A senior surprised by unexpected taxes commonly known as the Social Security tax torpedo.

Understanding and proactively addressing the possibility of a Social Security tax torpedo can increase your net income during retirement. By utilizing tools like Roth IRAs, charitable donations, and QLACs, you can create a more tax-efficient retirement.

Additionally, being mindful of how your income level relates to tax brackets and considering delaying Social Security can provide further avenues to optimize your financial well-being and quality of life in retirement. Consulting a financial advisor can be instrumental in tailoring these strategies to your specific circumstances, helping you maximize your hard-earned retirement benefits.

Tips for Avoiding the Social Security Tax Torpedo

Consulting a financial advisor is a crucial step in planning for retirement and avoiding the Social Security tax torpedo as you can get personalized guidance tailored to your specific financial situation, goals, and preferences. Finding a financial advisor doesn’t have to be hard. SmartAsset’s free tool matches you with up to three vetted financial advisors who serve your area, and you can have a free introductory call with your advisor matches to decide which one you feel is right for you. If you’re ready to find an advisor who can help you achieve your financial goals, get started now.

Planning during your working years makes a tax-efficient retirement more doable. However, if you’re already retired, you can still lower your taxes and set yourself up for a brighter financial future.

Keep an emergency fund on hand in case you run into unexpected expenses. An emergency fund should be liquid -- in an account that isn't at risk of significant fluctuation like the stock market. The tradeoff is that the value of liquid cash can be eroded by inflation. But a high-interest account allows you to earn compound interest. Compare savings accounts from these banks.

Yahoo Finance,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/super-micro-computer-stock-190-130000175.html,2024-06-30,13:00:00 UTC,Super Micro Computer Stock Is Up 190% So Far This Year. Can the Growth Continue in the Second Half of 2024?,"Super Micro Computer (NASDAQ: SMCI) has become one of the more dramatic and surprising companies in the stock market over the past year. The company existed for decades in obscurity, and its stock gained little traction for years after its 2007 initial public offering (IPO).

However, a key partnership with Nvidia has changed the game for Supermicro (as the company is commonly called). Consequently, its stock is up 190% in the first half of this year. With its massive gains, investors are right to ask whether that momentum can continue through the second half of 2024.

The state of Supermicro

Supermicro is a technology hardware company known for producing energy-saving, environmentally friendly tech products for the cloud, metaverse, and other applications. Its servers have gained the most attention, particularly those equipped with Nvidia's artificial intelligence (AI) chips. Thanks to this partnership, its profits and stock price have grown exponentially.

As recently as four years ago, its stock traded for about $24 per share. This year, its recent growth has been so dramatic that analysts predict nearly $24 per share for Supermicro's net income! Not surprisingly, such improvements have led to a 3,400% gain in the tech stock's price since 2020.

SMCI Chart

A Market.us study seems to confirm this trend. It predicts that the AI server industry will expand at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 30% through 2033, transforming what was a $31 billion industry last year into one worth $430 billion by 2033.

Can the growth continue?

Even the most dedicated Supermicro bulls should not expect another 3,400% gain over the next four-and-a-half years. While an additional 190% gain in six months is far from guaranteed, that move is not out of the question when one looks at the financials. In the nine months of fiscal 2024 (ended March 31), its net sales of $9.6 billion rose 95% from year-ago levels. Its cost of sales grew at a slightly faster 102%.

Consequently, its net income of $855 million grew 92% over the same period. Also, with consensus estimates pointing to a 102% increase in net income for the fiscal year, its earnings are rising fast enough for the stock to maintain a rapid growth pace.

Additionally, despite surging profits and massive stock price growth, its price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio is 47 and its forward P/E ratio is 36. This is less than some of the faster-growing tech stalwarts such as Nvidia and Amazon, indicating it could sustain the multiple expansions needed to take the stock price much higher, possibly enough to maintain the current growth pace for another six months.

Story continues

Supermicro in the second half of 2024

Given its business and financial conditions, a 190% gain for the second half of this year is a plausible scenario. Admittedly, the market makes no guarantees, and ultimately, investors should not expect a 190% move higher by the end of 2024.

However, demand for the company's servers is likely to continue rising, possibly enough to sustain near triple-digit revenue and profit growth for the foreseeable future.

At its current valuation, a 190% increase in the stock price would give it an expensive, but not record-breaking P/E ratio. Hence, even if it falls short of that ambitious goal, Supermicro could still deliver significant returns for the rest of the year.

Yahoo Finance,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/rivian-soars-volkswagen-investment-too-133000251.html,2024-06-30,13:30:00 UTC,Rivian Soars After Volkswagen Investment. Is It Too Late to Buy the Stock?,"Share prices of Rivian (NASDAQ: RIVN) surged higher after the maker of electric vehicles (EV) received a sizeable investment from German automaker Volkswagen (OTC: VWAGY). Despite the recent price gains, the stock is still down nearly 43% in 2024.

Let's look at the importance of this investment, how it could help Rivian, and if it is too late to buy the stock.

Volkswagen investment

Volkswagen announced it will invest up to $5 billion in Rivian over three years as well as form a 50/50 joint venture (JV) between the companies. Volkswagen will initially invest $1 billion in the company in the form of a convertible note, which will convert to Rivian shares once it receives regulatory approvals, but not before Dec. 1, 2024.

If the JV is approved, the German automaker would look to invest another $4 billion into Rivian or the JV by 2026, including another $1 billion this year upon the implementation of the JV. The purpose of the JV will be to develop next-generation electrical/electronic (E/E) architecture for EVs.

For the JV, Rivian will contribute its expertise in the field of electronic architecture for software-defined vehicles and the associated IP via a fully paid-up license. The formation of the JV will also allow Volkswagen to use Rivian's current electronic architecture in its own vehicles, which includes its new zonal hardware design.

For Volkswagen, the deal brings with it immediate access to much-needed technology to develop its next generation of EVs. Rivian is one of the few non-Chinese automakers outside of Tesla so far to develop zonal architecture.

For Rivian, meanwhile, this is a huge cash infusion that will allow the company to continue to scale its business. Along with the current $7.9 billion in cash on its balance sheet, this should give Rivian ample room to ramp up production of its lower-priced R2 SUV models at its Illinois plant, as well as build out its planned $5 billion manufacturing campus in Georgia, which it temporarily paused construction on earlier this year.

Volkswagen will also lend some of its manufacturing expertise, which can help Rivian continue to cut manufacturing costs. Rivian has done a great job creating popular luxury electric SUVs, but it has not been able to sell them for a profit, losing money on each vehicle it sells. At its investor day following the Volkswagen announcement, the company spent much of its time discussing reducing the costs of its vehicles so it could obtain a positive gross margin.

The company reiterated its forecast to be near a positive gross margin in the fourth quarter, and it set a long-term target of a 25% gross margin. It is also looking for a 10% free cash flow margin and a high-teens adjusted profit margin over the long term.

Is it too late to buy the stock?

The Volkswagen investment, if the JV is approved, should give Rivian the cash it needs to scale its business and make it viable. Negative gross margins and cash flow have been its biggest issues, but the company has made aggressive steps to reduce the cost of its vehicles and improve its manufacturing process.

The development of its zonal architecture, meanwhile, has not only greatly improved the cost structure of its vehicles, but has also proven to be a highly valuable technology that Volkswagen was willing to pay a lot of money to get access to for use in its vehicles.

The deal now gives Rivian two very large powerful investors and partners in Volkswagen and Amazon, for whom it has a deal in place to make Amazon's electric van fleet.

Rivian remains a high-risk/high-reward stock given its early-stage nature and still negative gross margin. However, the deal with Volkswagen helped remove a lot of the liquidity risk associated with the company. As such, the stock looks more attractive from a risk-reward basis after its recent run-up than before the deal.

Yahoo Finance,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/billionaires-selling-nvidia-buying-undervalued-082500110.html,2024-06-30,08:25:00 UTC,Billionaires Are Selling Nvidia and Buying These Undervalued ETFs Instead,"Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA) has seen the value of its shares skyrocket over the past two years as the biggest chip supplier in the race for artificial intelligence (AI) supremacy.

Several hedge fund managers spotted the potential for Nvidia in AI early and made considerable bets on the semiconductor stock. Stan Druckenmiller accumulated a sizable position in the stock in late 2022 and early 2023 as OpenAI's ChatGPT took the world by storm. At one point, Nvidia stock accounted for 16% of his portfolio. David Tepper, owner of the NFL's Carolina Panthers, likewise built a huge position in the stock in the first half of 2023.

But billionaires, as a group, have started selling off their Nvidia shares. That's in large part due to the incredible run the stock has been on. It's up over 160% this year already, and it was briefly the most valuable company in the world.

Here are some of the billionaires selling their positions in Nvidia:

Stan Druckenmiller (Duquesne Family Office) sold 441,551 shares and all 4,895 call options, reducing his total exposure to the stock by about 84%.

Philippe Laffont (Coatue Management) sold 2.9 million shares, cutting his position by 68%.

David Tepper (Appaloosa) sold 348,000 shares, trimming his position by 44%.

Israel Englander (Millennium Management) sold 720,004 shares and 6,910 calls, cutting his bullish position by about one-third. He also trimmed Millennium's put options, but by less than 20%, leaning more bearish.

Billionaires are smart to take some of their money off the table and reinvest into other assets as a way to diversify their portfolios and potentially find the next big winners. The ones listed above put a lot of the money from selling Nvidia into some undervalued exchange-traded funds (ETFs) that both diversify away from Nvidia and provide a lot of potential upside.

Betting big on small stocks

Both Druckenmiller and Englander added exposure to the iShares Russell 2000 ETF (NYSEMKT: IWM). It tracks the Russell 2000 index, which is the most commonly used index for small-cap stocks.

Druckenmiller bought 31,579 call options on the ETF, which had a total value of $664 million as of the end of the first quarter. That makes the ETF his largest position, representing 15% of his portfolio. Englander, meanwhile, pared back on puts while adding a substantial number of calls and shares of the ETF itself.

There's good reason to be more bullish on small caps these days. While large-cap stocks like those found in the S&P 500 have fully recovered from the 2022 bear market, small-cap stocks like those in the Russell 2000 or S&P 600 aren't back to all-time highs. The current high interest rates are much more challenging for small caps, which often rely on revolving debt to fund their growth instead of long-term bonds or existing cash flows.

Story continues

As such, the valuation of small-cap stocks remains depressed relative to the large-cap market. The gap between the forward price-to-earnings ratio of the S&P 500 and the S&P 600 is the largest it's been since 2001. That could make it a stellar opportunity to invest in small-cap stocks right now. Druckenmiller is going big, and Englander is also coming around to the idea.

Finding value in China

Tepper and Laffont are looking to the world's second-largest economy for investment opportunities. Both added shares of the iShares China Large-Cap ETF (NYSEMKT: FXI). It tracks the performance of the FTSE China 50 Index, which follows 50 of the largest and most liquid Chinese companies trading on the Hong Kong Stock Exchange.

Tepper bought 6.4 million shares of the ETF, which had a value of $153.4 million as of the end of the first quarter, representing about 2.3% of his portfolio. Laffont added 2.1 million shares, worth about $50 million, or 0.2% of Coatue's portfolio.

Tepper is extremely bullish on China, adding many large-cap tech names from the country last quarter, including Alibaba Group, Baidu, PDD Holdings, and JD.com. Most can be found in the iShares ETF.

China was slow to reopen as COVID-19 pressures eased, and it now faces a property crisis, slow economic growth, and deflation as consumers slow their spending. It also faces political tensions. Stock prices declined for a third consecutive year in 2023. While prices have recovered somewhat in 2024, the China Large-Cap ETF is still down nearly 50% from the all-time high reached in early 2021.

But the tide might be turning for China. Pandemic-related restrictions have eased up, and the government is enacting stimulus measures to support the property sector and get Chinese consumers spending again. The efforts began in earnest in February, and the impact on the stock market is evident. Tepper and Laffont's new favorite ETF is up 22% since the start of February.

Considering how far Chinese stocks have fallen, there's still a long way for them to come back. Valuations remain attractive, but there's still a lot of uncertainty about how strongly China can rebound. With the attractive prices for some of the leading names in their industries, however, it could be worth taking a closer look at the Chinese stock ETF.

Yahoo Finance,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/best-stocks-invest-50-000-121900503.html,2024-06-30,12:19:00 UTC,"The Best Stocks to Invest $50,000 in 2024","Stocks have been on the rise this year, with the S&P 500 up 15% year to date. The index is on track to outperform last year's growth, as the S&P 500 rose 13% over the same period (January to June) in 2023.

Wall Street has grown particularly bullish about tech stocks thanks to advances in fields like artificial intelligence (AI). The same was true this time last year. However, the key difference is there have now been several quarters of tangible results that prove AI is truly boosting earnings for several companies and is a worthy venture.

However, tech is a lot more than AI. The industry covers countless sectors that will likely keep it expanding for decades. As a result, it could be a good idea to make a considerable investment in companies with exposure to AI and other areas of tech. Innovative organizations that lead critical parts of the industry could deliver major gains over the long term as the tech market expands.

So, are you looking to invest $50,000 in the stock market? Here are two of the best stocks that money can buy in 2024 (and are even worth buying with a smaller investment).

1. Nvidia

Nvidia's (NASDAQ: NVDA) business has exploded over the last year as it has become a leader in AI. Its chips have become the gold standard in the industry, coveted by developers worldwide. As a result, the company's stock is up 196% year over year, driven primarily by excitement over AI. However, as a leading chipmaker, Nvidia has positions in multiple markets outside of AI that could further boost its business for years.

Before the recent boom in AI, Nvidia was best known for its prominent role in gaming. The company was one of the first to sell graphics processing units (GPUs) for the consumer market, which gamers use to custom-build high-powered gaming PCs. Nvidia's success in the industry gave it the financial resources to branch out to other tech sectors like data centers, game consoles, consumer products, self-driving cars, and AI.

Increased interest in AI kicked off at the start of last year. However, Nvidia was a promising growth stock long before that, with its share price rising 338% in the five years leading up to 2023. AI has only strengthened Nvidia's outlook and worth as a long-term investment.

In the first quarter of 2025 (ending April 2024), Nvidia's revenue climbed 262% year over year, fueled mainly by a 427% increase in its data center segment (representing a rise in AI GPU sales). However, the company also saw encouraging growth in gaming and automotive, where revenue rose 18% and 11%.

Story continues

The automotive segment includes income from chips supplied to companies leading the way in self-driving technology. The market is still in its infancy but could be a major growth catalyst as chip demand rises alongside the expanding industry.

In addition to massive growth potential across tech, Nvidia's price/earnings-to-growth ratio (PEG) is less than 1, indicating its stock remains a value play despite recent growth. At its current position, an investment of $25,000 would secure roughly 201 shares in Nvidia -- significantly more than a few months ago, thanks to a recent stock split.

At this price, the company is screaming buy this year for long-term-minded investors.

2. Amazon

Like Nvidia, Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN) has significantly expanded its reach in tech. Since its founding in 1994, Amazon has ventured into and eventually dominated multiple industries, including e-commerce, video streaming, and cloud computing.

It's as if the company can do no wrong, with solid leadership and vast financial resources that allow it to expand and overcome unexpected hurdles. As a result, its stock is a compelling option as it continues to see gains in retail and develops its roles in AI and digital ads.

In the first quarter of 2024, Amazon's revenue popped 13% year over year. The company profited from massive gains in operating income, more than tripling since last year to $15 billion thanks to growth in its retail segments and highly profitable cloud platform, Amazon Web Services (AWS).

Moreover, the quarter signaled a budding business for the company, with revenue from advertising services jumping 24% after the introduction of ads on its Prime Video streaming service. Amazon has a competitive edge in the industry with a leading market share in streaming. This could allow it to dominate the developing streaming advertising market in the coming years, further diversifying Amazon's business.

A $25,000 investment would buy roughly 130 shares in Amazon at its current price. The company's stock has climbed more than 100% over the last five years but could outperform that figure as it continues to expand in AI and other areas of tech. Like Nvidia, Amazon's PEG is also less than 1, making its stock just too good to pass up in 2024.

The Answer Might Surprise You.,"The time has finally come. On June 16, shares of Chipotle Mexican Grill (NYSE: CMG) underwent a closely watched and historic 50-for-1 stock split. The previous four-figure price tag of the stock is currently at about $65.

Management felt this was the right proposal, given how well the restaurant company's shares have been performing. They're up 44% in 2024, and in the past five years, have soared 348%.

Is this magnificent restaurant stock a no-brainer investment opportunity right after its 50-for-1 stock split?

No fundamental changes

Stock splits typically happen after a company's nominal share price gets too high. Of course, this is a good problem to have for Chipotle because it means the stock has done well for investors over the years. But by artificially cutting the price, the stock can be accessible to more investors.

Chipotle's outstanding share count expanded 50-fold to 1.4 billion. And the share price is now 1/50th what it was before this event. It's helpful to think of this situation as a pizza being cut into smaller slices.

It's really important to remember that from a fundamental perspective, nothing has changed with Chipotle. This is still the same business it was yesterday. Through its fast-casual stores, this company still sells Tex-Mex food like bowls and burritos.

Since the executive team first announced the stock split in March, shares have climbed 17%. Perhaps the anticipation of this happening is precisely what has driven even greater bullish sentiment from the market.

Curb your appetite

As we view the company and stock today to assess if Chipotle is a no-brainer investment opportunity, it's critical to consider the quality of the company. This is a stellar business.

The company continues to post strong financial results, despite ongoing macro headwinds. After revenue jumped 14.3% in 2023, it rose 14.1% in Q1 2024 (ended March 31). This was boosted by same-store sales growth of 7%, as well as the opening of 47 new restaurants.

Chipotle is extremely profitable, which is supported by its proven pricing power. In the past five years, the company's operating margin has averaged 11.5%. And from a store-level perspective, 27.5% of revenue turned into operating profit in the first quarter, an outstanding figure.

There's still a lot of growth to be achieved. Management sees the potential to have 7,000 stores open in North America one day, roughly double the current footprint. This goal is higher than the previous target of 6,000, so it shows you that the leadership team is extremely optimistic about Chipotle's long-term prospects to further penetrate its key market.

Story continues

All of these positive factors might make you believe that this stock is a no-brainer buying opportunity. However, consider just how high the expectations have gotten. It seems wild to me to pay a price-to-earnings ratio (P/E) of 70.1 for the shares of this business. There's no margin of safety for investors should the company post quarterly financial results that the market isn't pleased with for whatever reason.

Of course, unsustainable trends can last a lot longer than people might think. And this could be the case with Chipotle stock, as it has traded at a steep valuation for a while.

Not only do I think the stock should be avoided, but I’m also not comfortable calling this a no-brainer investment opportunity right now. Maybe if the P/E multiple dropped below 30, I'd adopt this view. This might not happen for a long time, though.

However, compelling evidence suggests that all three are positioned to outperform the market in the second half and beyond. Here's why.

The investment case for UPS stock

UPS, the package delivery giant, faced a tumultuous 2023, with some challenges spilling into the first half of 2024. Slowing economic growth has led to declining volume growth and revenue growth. A costly labor contract resolution further exacerbated the situation. To make matters worse, the prolonged labor negotiations led to customers diverting their deliveries to other networks, fearing a strike action.

However, these headwinds will turn into tailwinds in the second half as management believes year-over-year volume growth will start in the second quarter in the U.S. Meanwhile, the cost increases due to the labor contract are now in the numbers, so comparisons with last year will get easier. UPS is making 12,000 job cuts in response to weaker demand.

Everything points to a stronger second half, and management's guidance calls for adjusted operating profit to increase by 20% to 30% in the second half compared to the same period in 2023.

The key to the turnaround and the metric investors should watch closely when UPS reports its second-quarter earnings on July 23 is a return to delivery volume growth in the U.S. Management previously said it expected slightly positive average daily volume growth in the U.S. in the second quarter. If it occurs, then UPS will be well on its way to a recovery in 2024.

Image source: Getty Images.

Hexcel investors are worried about Boeing

There's little doubt that Hexcel has great long-term growth prospects. Its advanced composites offer a weight and strength advantage over traditional materials like aluminum. That's a big issue in aerospace as it helps optimize fuel consumption and reduce lifecycle operating and maintenance costs, particularly on widebody airplanes.

As such, there's a clear trend of new airplanes using more advanced composite materials. Meanwhile, Boeing and Airbus have multiyear backlogs and are looking to ramp up production. Everything points to a bright future for Hexcel.

That said, there will be some near-term turbulence in 2024, and that's why the company's stock has declined.

UPS Chart

In a nutshell, since there's little aftermarket demand for Hexcel's products, when airplane deliveries slow at one of its ultimate end market customers, in this case, Boeing, Hexcel could feel it in its orders. Unfortunately, the slowdown at Boeing is creating uncertainty, and investors are concerned. Moreover, Hexcel has been building its infrastructure to support future solid growth, holding back near-term profit margins.

Story continues

Putting it together, it's understandable that investors might have concerns. Still, these are near-term issues, and Boeing will surely ramp up its airplane production rate in the second half and increase it in the future. As such, investors in Hexcel can look forward to an ongoing recovery in sales and margin growth in the coming years.

Allegion secures the future

The security door and lock maker also has a bright future. It's leading the movement toward the convergence of electronic and mechanical security products, which has myriad benefits. Wireless-enabled technology allows building owners to monitor and control access areas remotely. Consequently, they can reduce shrinkage, improve security, grant and deny access daily, and improve workflow productivity by knowing which workers are in which areas at all times.

The added value is significant, and given that only about 30% of sales are from electronic products and the adoption rate of electronic locks is only 10% in North America, there's ample growth potential.

Still, investors are concerned with the company's exposure to the North American residential market in 2024, and it doesn't help that overall sales in the first quarter were down 3.6% organically year over year.

Image source: Getty Images.

However, both issues are likely to prove temporary. The North American housing market will improve in a lower interest rate environment. In addition, the revenue decline in the first quarter is largely down to a tough comparison with the first quarter of 2023, when organic sales increased by 15% on an organic basis. On a two-year comparison, sales increased by 5.3% on a compound annual growth rate basis.

As such, the dip in the share price looks to be an excellent buying opportunity in a long-term growth story.

Yahoo Finance,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/3-reasons-buy-roku-stock-140000247.html,2024-06-30,14:00:00 UTC,3 Reasons to Buy Roku Stock Like There's No Tomorrow,"Once a pandemic darling that was making its investors rich, Roku (NASDAQ: ROKU) has come crashing back toward Earth. The shares trade 88% below their all-time high, which was established in July 2021.

But don't let that distract you from the actual business. This leading streaming platform has some positive attributes that investors should know and appreciate.

Here are three reasons to buy Roku like there's no tomorrow -- and that's on top of the fact that the stock trades at a cheap price-to-sales multiple.



Key metrics

The first reason to scoop up shares stems from its strong performance metrics. In the first three months of 2024, the business reported a 19% year-over-year revenue jump. And this was after revenue rose 11% in 2023.

What's more, the user base continues to expand. As of March 31, Roku had 81.6 million active accounts. That figure was up from 80 million at the end of last year. And it represented an impressive 14% increase compared to the first quarter of 2023. This wide reach gives Roku top market share in the smart-TV market in North America.

Engagement shows no signs of weakness. In Q1, a whopping 30.8 billion hours of content was watched on the Roku platform. That number has continued to go up steadily with each passing quarter.

One area that might worry investors is Roku's monetization trends. Average revenue per user totaled $40.65 in the first quarter. While this was down from six months ago, it does appear to be stabilizing.

Industry position

It's been interesting to watch the changing media landscape over the past several years. From an investor's perspective, it can be confusing trying to understand what's happening. The good news, though, is that Roku looks to be well positioned in the industry.

It benefits from the cord-cutting trend, as consumers cancel their traditional cable-TV packages and move fully to streaming. In the U.S., less than half of all households still have their cable subscriptions. And the percentage is expected to keep declining going forward.

Given the multitude of streaming services available, having a single user interface that combines these content offerings drastically improves the viewing experience. This is where Roku's value proposition speaks for itself.

Roku is able to grow its business because of the billions of dollars that are spent by content companies like Netflix and Walt Disney. By aiming to be an agnostic platform that provides broad distribution capabilities to content providers, Roku stands to gain from the rise of streaming with more accounts signing up over time.

Story continues

Ad market

Rapidly rising interest rates in 2022 dampened the perspective on the economy. This resulted in marketing executives paring back their ad budgets in the anticipation that a recession would happen and that consumer spending would be under pressure. But this didn't become a reality.

Roku's platform segment, which enters into advertising revenue deals with its content partners, grew sales by 19% in Q1 to $755 million, representing 86% of the company total. This double-digit growth is very encouraging to see.

""The year-over-year growth of video advertising across the Roku platform outperformed both the overall ad market and the traditional linear TV ad market in the U.S.,"" Roku's CEO and CFO wrote in the Q1 2024 shareholder letter.

Over time, there's a huge opportunity for Roku to become an even bigger force. Consumers are spending more and more time watching streaming services. As ad dollars catch up, flowing from traditional cable TV, Roku looks like it is going to continue being a big beneficiary. And this supports the prospects of solid top-line growth.

Yahoo Finance,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/better-hydrogen-stock-plug-power-082000323.html,2024-06-30,08:20:00 UTC,Better Hydrogen Stock: Plug Power vs. Nikola,"Plug Power (NASDAQ: PLUG) and Nikola (NASDAQ: NKLA) represent two different ways to invest in the nascent hydrogen power market. Plug Power sells hydrogen fuel systems for electric forklifts and other warehouse equipment, while Nikola develops semitrailer trucks that run on electric batteries and hydrogen fuel cells.

Both stocks initially attracted a stampede of bulls. Plug Power went public at a reverse split-adjusted IPO price of $150 in October 1999, and its stock skyrocketed to a record high of $1,498 during the peak of the dot-com bubble.

Nikola went public by merging with a special purpose acquisition company (SPAC) in June 2020, and its stock opened at a reverse split-adjusted price of $1,126.50 on the first day before hitting its all-time high of $2,391.90 over the following week.

Image source: Nikola.

But today, Plug Power and Nikola only trade at about $2 and $10, respectively. Let's see why these hydrogen stocks ran out of fuel -- and which one could be the better turnaround play.

Plug Power still has a lot to prove

Plug Power has severe customer concentration issues. It generates most of its revenue by selling its fuel systems to Amazon and Walmart. But to lock in those two big customers, it granted them stock warrants (options to buy more shares of the company at a discount) to subsidize the fuel cells they bought.

That loss-leading strategy caused it to report a negative net revenue of $93 million in 2020 as the costs of funding those incentives offset its customer payments. Plug's revenue turned positive again in 2021 and subsequently rose 40% in 2022 and 27% in 2023, but its operating margins consistently withered as its net losses widened.

Metric 2021 2022 2023 Revenue $502 million $701 million $891 million Operating margin (87%) (97%) (151%) Net income (loss) ($460 million) ($724 million) ($1.37 billion)

Data source: Plug Power.

To make matters worse, it delayed the filing of its annual report for 2020 and had to restate all of its financials for 2018 and 2019. Those blunders, along with the market's waning interest in renewable energy stocks, drove away the bulls.

For 2024, analysts expect Plug Power's revenue to only rise 4% to $926 million, its operating margin to improve to negative 89%, and its net loss to narrow to $826 million. It mainly attributes that slowdown to the macro headwinds, which are driving its top customers to dial back their big hydrogen fuel cell upgrades.

The company ended the first quarter of 2024 with only $173 million in cash and equivalents, but it recently secured a new $1.66 billion loan from the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) to build up to six green hydrogen production facilities. That lifeline should buy it a bit more time to scale up its business, but it hasn't proven that its business model is sustainable yet.

Story continues

Nikola overpromised and underdelivered

Nikola only delivered 79 battery-powered semitrailer trucks (BEVs) and 35 hydrogen fuel cell-powered semitrailer trucks (FCEVs) in 2023. That was well below the original target of 3,500 BEVs and 2,000 FCEVs which it set during its pre-merger presentation. It also recalled nearly all of its BEVs last year after a series of widely publicized battery fires. Nikola originally aimed to generate $1.4 billion in revenue in 2023 but fell far short of that.

Metric 2021 2022 2023 Revenue $0 $51 million $36 million Operating margin N/A (1,378%) (1,806%) Net income (loss) ($690 million) ($784 million) ($966 million)

Data source: Nikola.

Nikola's founder and former CEO Trevor Milton was also convicted of securities and wire fraud in 2022.

The current CEO, Steve Girsky, claims the company can scale up its business and generate ""$150 million to $170 million"" in total truck revenue in 2024. Analysts expect it to generate $126 million in revenue, with a net loss of $496 million for the full year.

That's a grim outlook for a company that only had $346 million in cash and equivalents at the end of the first quarter of 2024. It's also constantly diluting its existing investors with new share offerings to raise more cash. Over the past three years, Nikola increased its share count by a whopping 242% as Plug Power's share count rose 30%.

Nikola believes it can overcome its growing pains, ramp up its production, and build more hydrogen charging stations with its partner Voltera to support its FCEVs. But just like Plug Power, there's no clear indication that its business model can survive over the long term. Its BEVs could also face fierce competition from Tesla's new Semi model.

The better buy: Plug Power

Plug Power and Nikola both look historically cheap at 2 and 4 times this year's sales, respectively. I personally wouldn't touch either of these stocks until more green shoots appear, but Plug Power's higher revenue, DOE lifeline, and lower valuations make it a more compelling turnaround play than Nikola right now.

Yahoo Finance,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/barclays-says-buy-software-stocks-130055040.html,2024-06-30,13:00:55 UTC,Barclays Says Buy These Software Stocks as Organizations Start to Deploy Generative AI,"A wise man once said that there is no new thing under the sun – and that’s true enough lately when it comes to the stock markets. Like last year, tech stocks are leading the gains, and AI stocks are providing the foundation for the tech boom.

Artificial intelligence is not a new technology – its earliest iterations date back to the 1950s – but its latest twist, generative AI, hit the ground running at the end of 2022. Now, companies of all stripes are starting to deploy gen AI in a whole host of new applications. Gen AI represents a new evolution in artificial intelligence technology, the ability to generate new content and materials rather than simply analyzing and synthesizing existing data. Companies that can successfully integrate gen AI, and put it into action on behalf of their customers will have an edge in the current environment.

This perspective aligns with Barclays’ Ryan MacWilliams’ view on AI-related companies. In a recent research report, the analyst wrote: “We view the DevOps market as an attractive investment opportunity. In our view, DevOps is well-positioned to capitalize on near-term AI-driven demand as more enterprises prioritize increasing software development velocity via developer tool spend investments. We note that the IDC expects a broader DevOps market CAGR of ~36% during 2023-2027. Further, we think that front-office developer roles could be among the first to return in an improving macro.”

Against this backdrop, we’ve used the TipRanks database to examine two of MacWilliams’ top AI picks, both of which have received a Strong Buy consensus rating. Let’s take a closer look at these selections.

JFrog (FROG)

The first stock we’ll look at is JFrog, a DevOps software firm dedicated to providing a seamless pathway for both regular and invisible software updates, with the goal of providing a hassle-free, secure workflow directly from the developers to the end-users. JFrog gives its customers a set of DevOps tools that are compatible with all major software technologies. The company’s platform enables users to take advantage of a fully automated DevOps pipeline.

In addition to full automation, JFrog’s DevOps platform provides high levels of security and availability, for the safe creation of robust production pipelines. The company’s tools are scalable, for any number of users or servers, and any size of needed storage. In addition, JFrog is compatible with hybrid systems, giving its customers the flexibility to run varying combinations of cloud, multi-cloud, and on-prem solutions.

Recently, JFrog announced it had entered into an agreement for the acquisition of Qwak AI, a creator of AI and MLOps platforms. The acquisition will allow JFrog to provide a unified platform solution for DevOps, Security, and MLOps stakeholders, an industry-leading unified functionality. For JFrog, the deal will enhance its machine learning capabilities, as well as further streamlining its development models. The acquisition deal has been valued at $230 million.

Story continues

Many tech companies operate at a loss, but that has not been the case most of the time for JFrog. In its last set of financial results, covering 1Q24, the company’s bottom line came to 16 cents per share by non-GAAP measures. This EPS was derived from a top line total revenue figure of $100.3 million, which was up more than 25% year-over-year, and was more than $1.6 million better than had been estimated.

When we check in with Barclays analyst MacWilliams, we find him upbeat on JFrog for both the near- and long-term, starting out his comments by writing, “We believe FROG can capitalize on near-term improvement in cloud demand for coding workloads (due to generative AI) as the global leader in binary management (MSFT partnership shows strategic importance).”

Looking farther ahead, MacWilliams adds, “Longer term, AI could accelerate cloud adoption and drive additional cloud artifactory spend, which positions FROG well as the leader in software supply chain management. Further, we think FROG’s consumption-based pricing approach could offer additional upside as greater AI-driven software development workflows could accelerate binary demand. Therefore we think FROG’s monetization model could be more closely correlated to heightened software output as a result of AI.”

Quantifying this stance, the analyst goes on to initiate his coverage of FROG with an Overweight (Buy) rating and a $50 price target that implies a one-year gain of 33%. (To watch MacWilliams’ track record, click here)

Overall, the 15 recent analyst reviews, with their 13 Buys and 2 Holds, give FROG shares a Strong Buy consensus rating, while the $46.38 average price target and the $37.55 current trading price together point toward a 23.5% share appreciation for the year ahead. (See JFrog’s stock forecast)

monday.com (MNDY)

Next on our list is monday.com, a cloud-based software firm that develops and markets a line of popular work management software products. The company’s product lines include tools for office system optimization, CRM and project management, marketing, and sales ops tools. The platform is cloud-based and targeted at enterprise clients at a wide range of scales. monday.com’s platform connects people and processes to bring transparency to office workflows.

Some numbers will show just how popular the system is. At the end of 2023, the company had over 225,000 customers on the books, and at the end of Q1 this year, it had 2,491 customers with more than $50,000 in annual recurring revenue each. This customer base is served by over 1,900 employees worldwide, in offices as widespread as New York, Miami, and Chicago; London and Warsaw; Sydney and Melbourne; Sao Paulo, Tokyo and Tel Aviv. Enterprise clients, ranging from blue chips like Coca Cola to leading tech innovators like Uber, all trust monday.com.

Word processes are notoriously boring – but monday.com brings AI into the picture, using the tech to power its automation systems. Data sorting, analysis, and categorization; deriving insights from textual analysis; creating communication summaries; setting up action plans; even translating international communications – the company has integrated AI into its platform to smooth out all of these functions.

On the financial side, monday.com showed earnings of 61 cents per share by non-GAAP measures in 1Q24, beating the forecast by 21 cents. This EPS was up strongly year-over-year; the 1Q23 result was 14 cents per share. At the top line, the company brought in total revenues of $216.9 million, approximately $6.3 million better than had been anticipated – and up more than 33% year-over-year.

Analyst MacWilliams starts up his coverage of MNDY with an upbeat stance, writing,“We believe in MNDY’s greenfield opportunity and new product upsells (like monday Dev) across its existing customer set. This enhanced cross-sell motion, improving GTM efficiency, and pricing benefits could drive upside to CY25 Street estimates.”

He goes on to outline a number of monday’s strengths, adding, “MNDY recently called out that ~1/3 of its customers used a CRM or DevOps template in 2023 and ~10% of the Fortune 500 are using one of those products. Since the wide release of monday Sales CRM and Dev, both products are growing in line to faster than when monday.com first launched. We believe MNDY’s cross sell motion and greenfield opportunity in these markets will continue to supplement its rev. growth LT, and we note that CRM (~$25 mil in ARR as of December 2023) and Dev were only available to net new customers until May 2024.”

These comments, taken all together, fully support MacWilliams’ Overweight (Buy) rating for MNDY shares, and his $275 price target shows his confidence in a one-year upside of 14%.

On Wall Street generally, this stock is getting plenty of love. It has 14 recent analyst reviews with an 11 to 3 split favoring Buy over Hold, for a Strong Buy consensus rating. That said, the $258.33 average price target is somewhat less bullish than the Barclays view and implies a 7% one-year upside potential from the current share price of $240.76.

Yahoo Finance,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/soundhound-ai-most-undervalued-artificial-174100706.html,2024-06-29,17:41:00 UTC,SoundHound AI Is the Most Undervalued Artificial Intelligence (AI) Stock to Buy Now,"SoundHound AI (NASDAQ: SOUN) has had quite the roller-coaster ride this year. But there's more excitement ahead, and I say it's time to buckle up for the next climb.

Despite its negative earnings and eyebrow-raising valuation ratios, SoundHound AI stands out as a diamond in the rough. The voice-control specialist's stock is currently down by a significant margin from its previous highs, but don't let that discourage you. Here's why I see a big future for this little artificial intelligence (AI) powerhouse, and why I'd still call it ""undervalued"" today.

A closer look at SoundHound AI

SoundHound AI focuses on voice AI and conversational intelligence technologies, fields that are becoming increasingly vital in our tech-driven world. With a backlog of long-term contracts totaling a whopping $682 million, this company has a clear path to future income that seems largely ignored by the current market price.

Yes, the stock has more than doubled from early February, when AI giant Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA) announced a small investment in SoundHound AI stock. But it stands far below the nearly $14 peak price recorded shortly after the initial public offering (IPO) in the inflation-burdened spring of 2022.

The market buzz around Nvidia's investment was more than hype, by the way. It was a nod from a proven tech giant recognizing SoundHound AI's long-term potential. While the stock has since cooled off, the company's fundamentals are anything but frosty.

Financial metrics and growth prospects

Despite its current unprofitability and high valuation ratios, SoundHound AI's financial health remains robust. The order backlog mentioned above amounts to nearly $700 million as of Q1 2024, up from $336 million in the year-ago period. This backlog reflects committed client contracts and realistic adoption estimates for subscription services, providing a solid foundation for future revenue.

A skyrocketing balance in this column suggests that customer interest for SoundHound AI's services is high and rising, and the backlog should convert into revenues over time. The stock is worth about 1.9 times that backlog today.

Comparing backlog to price-to-sales ratios can be misleading because backlog represents future potential revenue, whereas price-to-sales is based on current revenue.

So it's not an entirely fair apples-to-apples comparison to price-to-sales figures, where this stock looks expensive with a 25.5x multiple -- it should take years to complete the revenue-generating services. Still, most growth stocks would sell their proverbial mothers for a backlog like that.

Story continues

Moreover, SoundHound's comes with a robust financial base. With a cash balance of $180 million and only $85.5 million of long-term debt, SoundHound is well-equipped to continue its growth trajectory. This solid foundation is crucial to the hypergrowth phase of a hungry upstart, allowing the company to take bottom-line losses while optimizing its top-line growth trajectory. In other words, that massive order backlog wouldn't be what it is without SoundHound AI's willingness to finance this business stage through debt papers and open-market stock sales.

Positioned for long-term growth

SoundHound AI might seem like a wild ride, but that's part of its charm. Sure, the stock has taken some steep dives, but the fundamentals paint a promising picture. The company's backlog of long-term contracts is substantial, and its strategic moves have positioned it well for future growth.

Investors should be prepared for a bumpy journey, but the potential rewards should be worth the uncomfortable ride. SoundHound AI's innovative technology, coupled with its impressive backlog, suggests that this growth story is just getting started -- nearly two decades after the company's founding.

For those willing to embrace a bit of excitement and hold on through the twists and turns, SoundHound AI could be the ticket to market-beating returns. It's not a classic value stock, but it's hard to find a better buy in the overheated AI sector right now. I'd certainly buy SoundHound AI stock long before doubling down on Nvidia's lofty valuation.

Yahoo Finance,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/vanguards-top-etf-24-heres-085000170.html,2024-06-30,08:50:00 UTC,Vanguard's Top ETF Is Up 24% This Year. Here's Another ETF Up Twice As Much.,"There's a good reason why Warren Buffett likes Vanguard funds. Vanguard, led by (the late) Jack Bogle, pioneered and popularized investing in index funds. Vanguard's funds are known for their low costs.

Those low expense ratios wouldn't mean much, though, if Vanguard's funds didn't perform well. The good news is that many of them do. Vanguard's top exchange-traded fund (ETF) is up 24% this year. But there's another ETF up twice as much.

Beating Vanguard's best

Vanguard offers 86 ETFs. One has outperformed all others in 2024: The Vanguard S&P 500 Growth Index Fund ETF (NYSEMKT: VOOG). This ETF has jumped 24% this year following an impressive 28% gain in 2023.

Most investors would probably be happy with these returns. However, those who want even bigger gains might want to check out the VanEck Semiconductor ETF (NASDAQ: SMH). This ETF has soared a whopping 48% year to date.

The VanEck Semiconductor ETF is managed by global investment manager VanEck. This ETF attempts to track the performance of the MVIS U.S. Listed Semiconductor 25 Index. As its name reflects, this index includes companies involved in semiconductor production and equipment that trade on U.S. stock exchanges.

This year's big returns aren't a fluke for the VanEck Semiconductor ETF. It has delivered an average annual return of 38.6% over the last five years. Since the fund's inception in December 2011, its average annual return is 26.5%. By comparison, the Vanguard S&P Growth Index Fund ETF is up 16.6% over the last five years and 15.7% since its inception in September 2010.

Why the VanEck Semiconductor ETF is soaring

You can probably make a good guess as to why the VanEck Semiconductor ETF is performing so well this year. Chip stocks are sizzling hot thanks primarily to surging demand for servers for training and deploying artificial intelligence (AI) systems.

This VanEck ETF owns only 26 stocks. The top five holdings make up over 50% of its total portfolio. When these stocks move higher, so does the ETF's price. And they've moved a lot higher so far in 2024.

The fund's largest holding is Nvidia, which comprises 20.4% of its total assets. Nvidia's share price has exploded 150% higher this year. Customers can't get enough of the company's graphics processing units (GPUs), which are the gold standard in supporting AI models.

Another 12.9% of the VanEck Semiconductor ETF is invested in Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing. The company makes chips designed by leading customers including Nvidia. Its stock is up 65% year to date.

Story continues

Roughly 7.7% of the fund's portfolio is in Broadcom. The company recently announced a 10-for-1 stock split. Its shares have jumped more than 40% in 2024.

The VanEck ETF's fourth- and fifth-largest positions are Advanced Micro Devices and ASML Holding with 4.97% and 4.8%, respectively, of the fund's net assets. Advanced Micro Devices is one of Nvidia's top rivals. Its stock is up only around 8% this year. Meanwhile, shares of semiconductor fabrication equipment maker ASML have risen over 35%.

Should you buy this high-flying ETF?

Risk-averse investors should probably stay away from the VanEck Semiconductor ETF. When it falls, it falls hard. For example, in the second quarter of 2022, the ETF plunged 24%. The fund also trades at a premium with a price-to-earnings ratio of over 39 for the stocks in its portfolio.

However, aggressive investors who want to own a basket of semiconductor stocks should consider buying the ETF. AI should continue to provide a strong tailwind for these stocks. The VanEck ETF's annual expense ratio is 0.35%, higher than Vanguard's top ETF this year but still not too expensive. Also, Morningstar gives the VanEck Semiconductor ETF a five-star rating (the highest possible).

As far as I know, Buffett has never recommended VanEck as he has Vanguard. He doesn't own any VanEck ETFs. But with the pluses of the VanEck Semiconductor ETF, maybe he should.

Yahoo Finance,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/3-reasons-buy-enterprise-products-224400370.html,2024-06-29,22:44:00 UTC,3 Reasons to Buy Enterprise Products Partners Like There's No Tomorrow,"Enterprise Products Partners (NYSE: EPD) is the kind of income stock that even the most conservative investors will fall in love with. The list of positives includes a conservative business model in a highly volatile sector, a large yield, and a strong financial foundation.

If that sounds good to you, here's a closer look at each point as it relates to this vitally important midstream energy company.

1. Enterprise Products Partners is boring

Oil and natural gas prices can become pretty exciting at times, as both are frequently subject to massive and rapid swings. Given the impact of the commodities' prices on the financial performance of energy producers, the energy sector as a whole is generally viewed as volatile.

But there's one niche that operates in a very different manner: the midstream sector. This is where Enterprise Products Partners operates.

Midstream players like Enterprise own pipelines, along with storage and transportation infrastructure. These are vital assets that connect the upstream sector (drilling) to the downstream (refining and chemicals) and to the rest of the world.

Midstream companies generally charge fees for the use of their assets, making them toll-taker businesses. That means that energy demand is more important than energy prices to financial performance at Enterprise. And energy demand tends to be robust even when energy prices are low.

Enterprise isn't exciting -- it just helps move oil and natural gas around -- and that's going to be a huge plus for investors who like consistency.

2. Enterprise has a big, reliable yield

As a master limited partnership (MLP), Enterprise is specifically designed to pass income on to unitholders. So a high yield shouldn't be shocking, per se. But its 7.2% yield will still be very compelling for income-focused investors.

Compare that figure to the yield from the S&P 500 index, which is a scant 1.3%. Or to the broader energy sector, which is yielding around 3.1% using Energy Select Sector SPDR Fund as an industry proxy. It is hard to beat Enterprise Products Partners if you are looking for passive income in the energy sector.

EPD Chart

And there's another very attractive fact here: The company has increased its distribution each year for 25 consecutive years. The annualized growth of the distribution has averaged 7%, which is pretty impressive.

To be clear, more-recent increases haven't lived up to that figure, so investors should go in only expecting mid-single-digit hikes. But the real story is the lofty yield, not lofty distribution growth. Yield will, in the end, make up the lion's share of an investor's return.

Story continues

3. Enterprise has a rock-solid financial foundation

Of course, the yield is only as good as the distribution is strong. And luckily, Enterprise scores very well on financial strength. The long streak of annual distribution increases speaks to that strength, but there are more direct ways to assess the financial foundation here.

EPD Financial Debt to EBITDA (TTM) Chart

For starters, the balance sheet is rated investment grade. It maintained its leverage at the low end of its peers. Its debt-to-EBITDA (earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization) ratio, a key leverage metric in the midstream space, has been an industry best for some time.

And, more to the point, the company's distributable cash flow covers its distribution 1.7 times over. There is a lot of room for adversity here before that distribution would be at risk of being cut.

A great option for income investors

There are always trade-offs when it comes to investing. With Enterprise, the biggest one is going to be low growth.

But if your goal is generating a reliable passive income stream, then you will probably look at Enterprise and want to buy it like there's no tomorrow. Of course, you shouldn't own only Enterprise, and it should be viewed as one part of a larger, diversified portfolio. But it is, really, every bit as good as it seems if you are trying to find reliable income stocks.

Yahoo Finance,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/stock-market-indicator-86-accurate-090000567.html,2024-06-30,09:00:00 UTC,"This Stock Market Indicator Has Been 86% Accurate Since 1984, and It Signals a Big Move in the Second Half of 2024","The S&P 500 (SNPINDEX: ^GSPC) advanced 14.5% in the first half of 2024. That momentum was initially driven by rate-cut hopes. Investors entered the year thinking the Federal Reserve would cut its benchmark interest rate six times. But sticky inflation reset those expectations. The market now anticipates just two cuts later this year, according to CME Group's FedWatch Tool.

Fortunately, enthusiasm about artificial intelligence (AI) provided a second tailwind for the S&P 500. Investors have shrugged aside concerns about the macroeconomic environment and piled into AI stocks. For instance, Nvidia alone has contributed about 30% of the gains in the S&P 500 year to date, while Microsoft, Alphabet, and Amazon have collectively driven about 26% of the gains.

The S&P 500's performance in the second half of 2024 will depend on how those variables continue to evolve, but one stock market indicator says the index will maintain its upward momentum. Specifically, following double-digit returns in the first half of the year, the S&P 500 has almost always climbed even higher during the second half. Here's what investors should know.

History says the S&P 500 will soar in the second half of 2024

Going back to 1984, the S&P 500 has returned at least 10% during the first half of the year on 14 occasions. The index continued moving higher during the second half of the year on 12 of those 14 occasions, or 86% of the time. The chart below provides more detail.

Year S&P 500 First-Half Return S&P 500 Second-Half Return 1985 15% 10% 1986 19% (3%) 1987 26% (19%) 1988 11% 2% 1989 15% 11% 1991 12% 12% 1995 19% 13% 1997 19% 10% 1998 17% 8% 1999 12% 7% 2013 13% 15% 2019 17% 10% 2021 14% 11% 2023 16% 7% Median N/A 10%

Data source: YCharts.

As shown above, when the S&P 500 has advanced at least 10% during the first half of a given year, the index has returned a median of 10% during the second half of the year.

Past performance is never a guarantee of future results, but history implies double-digit upside in the S&P 500 through the remaining months of 2024. That is significant because the S&P 500 is considered the best benchmark for the overall U.S. stock market. Investors can capitalize on that potential upside by purchasing individual stocks, especially those that fall into the category of AI enablers, or an S&P 500 index fund.

What investors should watch in the second half of 2024

Wall Street will continue to fixate on inflation and interest rates in the second half of the year, so investors should monitor both metrics. The Federal Reserve expects inflation to cool to 2.5% this year, as measured by the personal consumption expenditure (PCE) price index, but policymakers could cut interest rates faster than anticipated if inflation moderates more quickly. That would theoretically stimulate the economy and boost corporate earnings, potentially sending the S&P 500 higher.

Story continues

Alternatively, the Federal Reserve might not cut interest rates at all this year if inflation remains elevated. In that scenario, high borrowing costs would continue to weigh on consumer and business spending, creating headwinds to economic growth that could tailspin into a recession. Even if the economy avoids a downturn, elevated interest rates could lead to worse-than-expected financial results across the stock market, potentially sending the S&P 500 lower.

Additionally, investors should be aware of the precarious situation regarding valuations. The S&P 500 currently trades at 26 times earnings, a premium to the five-year average of 23.3 times earnings and the 10-year average of 21.4 times earnings. That means many stocks are expensive by historical standards, such that any pertinent bad news could have a particularly pronounced impact on the stock market.

Of course, those are not the only variables that could sway the S&P 500 in the second half. They are merely the furthest downstream. Ultimately, anything that influences corporate earnings or investor sentiment -- be it the presidential election, geopolitical turmoil, breakthroughs in AI, or any number of impossible-to-predict events -- could sway the stock market for better or worse in the remaining months of the year.

With that in mind, here's the most valuable insight I can offer: The stock market has consistently performed well over long periods. Economic downturns dragged the S&P 500 through 14 market corrections and five bear markets in the last three decades, but the index still returned 2,060% during that period, which is the same as 10.7% annually. So, patient investors that buy and hold good stocks (or an S&P 500 index fund) at reasonable prices will likely be well rewarded over time, regardless of how the stock market performs in the second half of 2024.

Getty Images The former Honda site in Swindon will become a warehousing and logistics facility

Amid a vast expanse of rubble, dust and noise, a green crane yanks away at a corrugated roof like a frustrated dentist attempting to extract a particularly stubborn wisdom tooth. Swindon’s Honda factory - once one of the world’s most advanced car factories - is being demolished, three decades after it opened. This used to be one of the fastest-growing towns in Europe. It was one of the jewels in the crown of investments attracted to the UK by Margaret Thatcher’s brand of 1980s enterprise. Swindon voted for her, John Major, Tony Blair, David Cameron, Theresa May and Boris Johnson. It was also one of the first towns to declare for Brexit, by 55%. But last year, its council changed hands to Labour. The council has had to continue to accelerate cuts to local services, passing a budget with record cuts in order to stave off bankruptcy. Inflation, rising care expenses, and central government grant squeezes meant cuts to libraries, the Dial-a-Ride community transport service and dimmed street lights. There has been an almost 5% rise in council tax. The council leader has warned any further cuts will affect frontline services. What is happening in Swindon is a visible consequence of sluggish long-term economic growth. Government spending cuts, low private investment, deindustrialisation and shrinking disposable income have left scars even on what was one of the UK’s famous boom towns.

The Honda site is set to become a warehousing and logistics facility. In another world, it would have been replaced by another major global manufacturer. Tesla, for example, was invited. Whereas five years ago the promise was to level up left-behind Northern towns, places like Swindon feel levelled down. The question about growth arising in this town is vital to whoever wins Thursday’s election. Elsewhere in the world, sites like this are being repurposed for electric car manufacturing. The Americans are pouring public money into their factories to try to compete with China, who will soon be confirmed as the world’s biggest car exporter. Emerging economies from Indonesia to Vietnam to Turkey are also investing in and growing their car industries. Indeed it was to Turkey that the entire Honda production line, including dozens of never-used industrial robots, was packed up and shipped off via the M4 and Bristol port last year. Swindon is not just about Honda. It is part of the M4 corridor where there are plenty of jobs in the knowledge sectors, and in finance, for example at the headquarters of Nationwide. The overall unemployment rate is just 2.6%, but the number of people not in work and not looking for work is 18%.

Faisal Islam joined Gary Huett, who contacted the BBC as part of the Your Voice, Your Vote election project, for a bike ride around Swindon

Marcus Kittridge, a former Honda engineer who now runs a cafe in the centre of town with his wife Tracey, accepts there are still “good employment prospects” but says many are at or “50p above” minimum wage, and says this has contributed to a decline in disposable income in the centre of town. “It’s like a Northern town that lost its industry in the 1970s,” he tells me. They now shut the cafe at 14:00 every day because of the high price of energy. He expects to be passing on his rising costs in higher prices for the next year or two. They have also stopped selling smoothies, after a notable decline in the availability and quality of fresh fruit, which they blame on post-Brexit changes. “We were told the quality of food was going to go up after Brexit, I can tell you now it has not. I’ve barely heard any politician mention it, but it definitely has had an impact on us,” Tracey says. Might she have been a bit unlucky with her purchases of fresh produce? “If I’m unlucky, I’m getting unlucky every single day and I’m probably the unluckiest person on earth,” she says. Their experience shows that some of the undercurrents of sluggish long-term growth - high energy prices, low disposable income, low investment, and new trade barriers can combine in unusual ways.

Gary Huett, a retired graphic designer also from Swindon who got in touch as part of the BBC's Your Voice, Your Vote project inviting you to tell us what matters, wanted to know why Swindon’s town centre looked like it was “rotting” and asked if anything could change. “We’ve now got pound shops predominantly, and the thriving night scene, packed with the yuppy set in the 1980s and 1990s has gone and decayed.”

Gary Huett wants to know why Swindon's town centre looks like it is ""rotting""

The Conservatives say green shoots are already here. The latest growth figures for January to March show the UK now has the fastest growing economy in the G7 group of advanced economies, after last year’s brief recession. Swindon’s jobs record remains strong. On the Honda site, new investment has come, and the jobs, albeit in warehousing rather than manufacturing, will return. For Labour, Swindon - a bellwether town where residents have voted the same way as the eventual national winner for the last 40 years - shows that there are no quick fixes. They are not competing with the US or European Union (EU) with big public investments in green energy. Council spending remains unprotected and subject to the same ongoing squeeze. A looser planning regime might help build more houses or expand the solar farms that dot the countryside around the town. But the job of transformation is very real. When asked what will happen if the economy does not grow, Labour has responded by saying some variation of “I’m not defeatist” or “we can do it”. When I interviewed shadow chancellor Rachel Reeves in Swindon, I said that if she was relying on planning changes to transform growth prospects, they were going to have to be a revolutionary, almost Thatcher-style ""Big Bang"". She told me: “It’s big reform we are offering… unless we grow the economy we’re going to be stuck in a doom loop of low growth, high taxes and poor public services.” Labour’s hope is that there is a tsunami of private investment that has been held back from this country due to political and economic instability. That, the party says, can be unleashed by the tens of billions with a strong and stable pro-growth government.","Swindon’s Honda factory - once one of the world’s most advanced car factories - is being demolished, three decades after it opened.
Government spending cuts, low private investment, deindustrialisation and shrinking disposable income have left scars even on what was one of the UK’s famous boom towns.

12 hours ago Share

BBC

The computer expert who helped build the faulty Horizon software has finally spoken under oath about his involvement in the Post Office scandal. Gareth Jenkins is a key figure, having appeared as an expert witness to defend Horizon in court cases, and is now at the centre of an alleged cover-up. His appearance at the inquiry was long-awaited after being postponed twice. He gave evidence over four days - the longest run of questions any witness has faced - and gave his version of events. Here are five key moments from his evidence.

1. He thought Horizon bugs were fixed quickly

Gareth Jenkins referred to Horizon's overall reliability throughout his testimony, even challenging findings from the landmark Bates v Post Office case that identified issues with the IT system. He acknowledged ""individual problems"" affecting specific branches but asserted that, as a whole, the system was ""working well"". When questioned about bugs, Mr Jenkins admitted lacking personal knowledge of all known issues, stating he typically became involved when drafted in for problem resolution. When pressed on how he could provide court evidence without full oversight of existing problems, Mr Jenkins said: ""Bugs impacting accounts were rare. Monitoring was in place, and fixes were prompt. Therefore, live system problems were rare, making me confident in its operation."" He claimed nobody from the Post Office alerted him to unknown issues, and he didn't actively seek information about bugs he wasn't involved in fixing. Mr Jenkins admitted not realising the need for comprehensive knowledge when giving evidence and ""with hindsight would have done things differently"".

2. He was sent expert witness rules

Mr Jenkins was an “expert witness” in several prosecutions brought by the Post Office. His duty was to the courts, not the Post Office or his employer Fujitsu. His role meant disclosing any relevant information about the Horizon software – even evidence that could help sub-postmasters' cases. Lawyers should have ensured that Mr Jenkins understood this. When asked about this by Mr Beer, Mr Jenkins stated that he didn’t know about his responsibilities until the end of 2020. But Mr Beer showed him a letter from November 2005, written by lawyers working for the Post Office. The letter mentioned that he was an expert witness and, according to Mr Beer, listed his duties in an “easy-to-understand way”. After initially denying he had received it, Mr Jenkins later accepted that it was sent to him. He said he had “no recollection of having been briefed” on his duties and had “clearly forgotten” about having seen the letter.

3. He knew remote access was possible

The former ""distinguished engineer"" faced intense questioning regarding remote access – the ability of Fujitsu staff to modify sub-postmaster branch accounts without their knowledge. In his 2010 witness statement for Seema Misra's trial, he stated: ""No external systems can manipulate branch accounts without user awareness and authorisation."" During the inquiry, Mr Jenkins accepted knowing that remote access was possible but believed it happened infrequently and left a visible trail. He based this view on ""informal chats"" with other Fujitsu IT staff. The former engineer told the inquiry that he only discovered the extent of unrestricted access Fujitsu technical staff had to sub-postmaster accounts during the 2018 High Court battle.

4. He was a 'willing actor' for the Post Office

In 2005, Mr Jenkins was asked to provide a draft witness statement in the case of sub-postmaster Noel Thomas. The Post Office wanted his thoughts on how the losses could have occurred. One possibility, he said, was some sort of system failure. But the Post Office demanded changes, saying the line was potentially “very damaging"". It got deleted. The inquiry heard he was a “willing actor” in this process. He said he was happy with the changes he ended up with as it still accurately reflected what had happened but used “less emotive words"". The Post Office was applying the pressure, but he never checked with his own Fujitsu lawyers about signing off evidence that had been toned down. Earlier he was asked to explain attempts to “tweak” his statements, but Mr Jenkins believed this was more of a “tidying up” to make them easier to read. He said he pushed back when the changes went too far.

5. He was 'better with systems than people'

Four days of forensic questioning meant plenty of room for big revelations. It also meant Gareth Jenkins had nowhere to hide. It was very revealing about the character of the man who has been mentioned so many times at this inquiry. An IT specialist who spent his entire career at one company, by his own admission, he dealt “better with systems than people”. He would have been happiest engineering and designing, but found himself entangled in something very different. Something, he argues, he didn't fully understand. ""Can't you use the report I have already sent you?"" Mr Jenkins wrote to a Post Office lawyer in 2012. It is clear he was viewing the growing number of legal queries as a confusing frustration, taking him away from the tech front line. It is an annoyance that hasn't gone away. At one point, Mr Jenkins told the inquiry chair he wanted this ""over with"". Given the ongoing investigations, that seems unlikely.","What we learned from IT expert at Post Office inquiry12 hours ago ShareBBCThe computer expert who helped build the faulty Horizon software has finally spoken under oath about his involvement in the Post Office scandal.

11 hours ago By Angie Brown , BBC Scotland, Edinburgh and East reporter Share

BBC Jakub Parulski, who lives with his wife and two young daughters, said they were in a 'horror story'

Residents of affordable housing developments in Edinburgh have said they are ""living in a horror story"" after being hit with a massive rise in their gas bill as costs are beginning to fall across the rest of the country. The Harvester's Way development has 180 properties which are all connected to a district heating system, where one huge gas boiler provides heating and hot water to all the homes. It is billed as a greener and more efficient way to heat their homes but it also means residents are unable to shop around for the best prices. Places For People Scotland, which operates about 1,000 homes across five sites in Edinburgh, has told residents the tariff for gas will jump 450% from 1 August, meaning people in a two-bedroom flat could be paying as much as £400 a month. It said the new heat tariff was procured at the end of last year and reflected the market conditions at the time. The unit price for gas can vary significantly and energy companies also impose standing charges, but the average UK unit price is currently just above 7p per kWh. The Harvester's Way residents were paying 4p/kWh but that is increasing to 22.18p/kWh.

Some of the residents from People For Places developments in Edinburgh who say they cannot pay their new gas bill prices

Jakub Parulski, who lives on the development with his wife Kasia and two young daughters, said his monthly gas bill will rise from £60 to £350. He said: ""These properties were aimed at affordable housing for low income families, this is not affordable by any means and we are very anxious about this. ""The problem is we can't boycott paying because we have pre-payment, pay-as-you go meters so they have us locked. ""We have no choice. The only choice we have is if we go cold with our small kids in the property."" The low carbon heating and hot water district heat network has a smart valve in each home linking payments to access to heating and hot water. As long as their account is in credit, the valve will remain open and they have access to heating and hot water. If an account runs out of credit, the valve closes until a top-up payment is made. Mr Parulski said he would not be able to sell his house because no-one would buy a property with such a high gas tariff. ""We are absolutely devastated. We are going to be locked in properties we cannot afford,"" he said. ""People will lose their homes. Some of us are looking at being homeless, some of us are nosediving into poverty. ""It is impossible now for us to sell our properties. We feel trapped and this is beginning to be a horror story and is no joke for a lot of us. ""It is really desperate.""

Henda Sankareh said she got the ""fright of her life"" at the new gas prices

The price rise was first introduced in April but delayed after residents complained. They told BBC Scotland the first they knew about their tariff changing was when credit in their pay-as-you-go meters suddenly dropped overnight. When Henda Sankareh noticed she had no hot water to wash her four-month-old baby at her rented flat on the Harvester's Way development she thought the boiler was broken. So the mother-of-two called the managers running the development to report the fault. But the 30-year-old said she got the ""fright of her life"" when they told her there was no problem with the heating and instead she had just run out of credit. She checked her meter and was shocked to see her monthly instalment had disappeared in less than a week. She said: ""They just told me the price had gone up so I needed to put more money in the meter. ""That's when I got into a panic. All the money had gone in just five days. I had had no notice or letter or email to warn me.""

Scott Walker with his wife Samantha and daughter Molly

After residents complained they had been given no warning Places for People Scotland launched an investigation. The company agreed to pay the higher tariff bill until the end of July but then residents would be locked into the new rates until the end of March 2025. In a letter to residents, it said: ""The procurement process requires us to adhere to terms and conditions known as the deed of conditions, which states we must get at least five cost quotes for price comparison before agreeing on a provider. ""Due to difficulties in finding gas suppliers for district heating, many providers chose not to participate."" Scott Walker, 50, a quality control technician living on the Harvester's Way development, said: ""I got a fright and felt very angry when I did the figures in my head and realised this was impossible to pay. ""We can't afford to move. He added: ""When we bought this house we were told this heating system was really efficient. ""We need to try to reduce the tariff. Obviously it has to go up but not that kind of percentage. It's extortionate. We would take a normal price that everyone else pays. ""I want to get an independent review done of the heating system and how they have come to these figures.""

Angela Stevenson said she would fight the price rise","The unit price for gas can vary significantly and energy companies also impose standing charges, but the average UK unit price is currently just above 7p per kWh.

Marks & Spencer is launching a new service for clothing repairs and alterations. From August, customers will be able to book through a dedicated online hub and have their fixed items posted back to them within seven to ten days. The work will be carried out by Deliveroo-style repairs start-up Sojo, and its in-house team of tailors, with prices starting at £5. The move comes as retailers try to encourage more sustainable habits among their shoppers.

Sojo launched during the Covid-19 pandemic in 2021 with a mission to make repairing, not simply replacing, clothing more mainstream. M&S said its partnership with Sojo aimed to provide customers with ways to extend the life of their clothing. “Through the launch of our repair service, we’re making it even easier for customers to give their clothes Another life, whether they are using our new repair service or long-standing clothes recycling scheme,"" said Richard Price, managing director of clothing & home at M&S.

Sojo's Josephine Philips wants to make repairing clothes more mainstream

Josephine Philips, Sojo's founder and chief executive, said the partnership marked ""an incredibly big step"" towards its mission of making clothes repairs more accessible. Siobhan Gehin, a retail expert and senior partner at consulting firm Roland Berger, told the BBC that by partnering with smaller, independent repair firms, large brands can provide customers with convenient alterations without having to create the infrastructure for these services themselves.

Growing trend among retailers

M&S is not alone in looking to repair services as a way to seemingly embrace and encourage sustainability. In January, Sojo took up a permanent space in Selfridges on London’s Oxford Street to provide customers with access to its clothing repairs service. The central London department store also gives shoppers access to handbag and trainer restoration services. Japanese fashion retailer Uniqlo, perhaps best known for its viral shoulder bag, offers clothing repairs and additional services such as embroidery for Uniqlo items at six of its UK stores. John Lewis has made its fashion rental service and recycling scheme a key part of its consumer-facing sustainability strategy, alongside accepting and reselling pre-loved products such as electronics and furniture. High Street stores Primark and H&M provide customers with online guides for repairing and maintaining their clothes, such as how to sew buttons and zips on to items or rework them entirely. Primark has also held free repair workshops for customers across the UK and Europe since 2022.

Thousands of UK bank customers were hit by payment problems affecting some of the biggest High Street lenders on Friday.

Banks including HSBC, Nationwide, Barclays and Virgin Money were all affected by issues with a system that operates payments between individuals and firms.

The group overseeing the payments system said the issue causing the problems has now been fixed, and the payment backlog has been cleared.

However, several people have told the BBC they are still facing issues, with some saying they now have little cash left.

The timing of the glitches was particularly problematic given the last Friday of the month is when many salaried staff are usually paid.

Many people also have to pay bills around this time.

""My bills are bouncing and I can’t pay for a train ticket I need in the next hour,"" said one customer on X.

Another said customers deserved compensation for the ""inconvenience on people’s pay day"".

""We all have bills to pay,"" they added.

Ryan, from Telford, who did not want his surname to be used, said he had not received his wages and as a result has £12 to his name.

The 29-year-old engineer said bills had started to be declined on his account.

""I’m supposed to be moving home next week and my savings have been emptied for deposits and rent,"" he said.

The BBC understands that the banks were affected by issues to Faster Payments, a system that operates ""under the bonnet"" of the UK financial system.

It aims to make sure real-time payments between millions of individuals and businesses are made seemingly instantly.

Pay UK, which oversees the system, said: ""We are aware that a small number of Faster Payments were delayed or not processed earlier today.

""Working with our infrastructure provider, this technical issue has been fixed.""

It then added later that ""payments have returned to normal and the backlog is resolved"".

However, some banking customers have disputed this, telling the BBC they have still yet to receive their salary payments.

HSBC, Nationwide, Barclays and Virgin Media had all apologised earlier for the delays to payments.

This is not the first time High Street lenders' services have been hit by problems.

Nationwide customers faced similar issues in March, while HSBC customers suffered an outage lasting over 24 hours in November.","Major UK high street banks say payment issues fixedThousands of UK bank customers were hit by payment problems affecting some of the biggest High Street lenders on Friday.

Lawyers acting on behalf of two people who fell ill in an E. coli outbreak in the UK have started legal action against two leading supermarkets. Law firm Fieldfisher said on Friday it had issued letters of claim for breach of the Consumer Protection Act over own-brand sandwiches purchased in Tesco and Asda. The claims for compensation relate to a man from the South East and an 11-year-old girl in the North West. One person in England has died linked to the ongoing E. coli outbreak, the UK Health Security Agency said on Thursday, although they had underlying health conditions. The E. coli outbreak is thought to be caused by some supermarket sandwiches containing salad leaves. The large majority of cases reported so far developed symptoms before 4 June and the number of cases being reported is now falling, offering hope the outbreak may have ended. Several food manufacturers recalled some of their products as a precaution. The Food Standards Agency said lettuce is the likely source, based on tests.

Fieldfisher said the claim against Asda related to a young girl who contracted E. coli after eating an own-brand chicken salad sandwich from the supermarket. ""The girl, aged 11, developed the serious condition haemolytic uraemic syndrome (HUS), which attacks the kidneys and has been on dialysis for three weeks,"" it said. ""She was discharged home two days ago but could be at risk of permanent kidney damage. Her mother bought three of the sandwiches as part of an online delivery."" An Asda spokesman said that it had not yet received any letter from Fieldfisher regarding these claims, but added: ""As soon as we do we will review the details of the claim as a matter of urgency."" Harvinder Kaur, a director at Fieldfisher, told the PA News agency earlier on Friday that she had issued a separate letter to Tesco on behalf of a man from the South East. He was also hospitalised with E. coli symptoms after eating Tesco-branded sandwiches containing salad, the law firm claims. ""Luckily, this client did not go on to develop HUS and is now home, but for a time he was seriously ill,"" she said. ""Under the Act, companies producing food must ensure it is safe to eat. ""If it causes illness, it is a breach of their duty and those injured are eligible to claim compensation, not least to fund possible ongoing medical care."" She added that the man was a ""regular shopper"" at Tesco, buying his lunch there most weekdays as it was very close to his work. The BBC understands Tesco has yet to receive the letter from Fieldfisher.

The economy grew by more than initially estimated in the first three months of 2024 as the UK emerged from recession, revised official figures show.

Between January and March, the economy grew by 0.7% the Office for National Statistics (ONS) said.

Figures released last month initially estimated growth had been 0.6%.

The strength of the economy has been a central battleground in the general election campaign, with growth having been sluggish in recent years.

Most economists, politicians and businesses want to see GDP rising steadily, because it usually means people are spending more, extra jobs are created, more tax is paid to the government and workers get better pay rises.

The original figure for the first quarter of the year was stronger than economists had expected, and growth in the services sector, which includes businesses such as hairdressers, banks, and hospitality, helped to push it higher, the ONS said.

But while services growth was revised upwards, increases in manufacturing were revised down on the back of more data being collected.

Due to the upward revision, the UK was the fastest growing economy in the G7 group of countries with advanced economies in the first three months of this year.

Prime Minister and Conservative leader Rishi Sunak hailed the new revised growth and said his party had a ""clear plan to deliver a more secure future for your family"".

But Labour accused the Conservatives of ""14 years economic vandalism"", which it said had left people worse off.

""A Labour government will grow the economy and show Britain is open for business with a plan for growth, so that we can put money back in people’s pockets,"" said a spokesperson.

Sarah Olney, Liberal Democrat Treasury spokesperson, said despite the upward revision, the figures would ""come as cold comfort for families being hammered by spiralling mortgage repayments, unfair stealth taxes and the cost of a weekly food shop going through the roof"".","UK economy grew more than first estimated in early 2024The economy grew by more than initially estimated in the first three months of 2024 as the UK emerged from recession, revised official figures show.

22 hours ago By Mark Palmer , BBC News Share

Getty Images The company had originally planned to shut down one of the blast furnaces by the end of June and the second by September

Workers at Tata Steel have been told the company is taking steps to potentially cease operations at much of the Port Talbot plant by 7 July because of a strike by the trade union Unite. The company had originally been planning to shut one of the blast furnaces by the end of June and the second one by September. But Port Talbot workers have been told that because of the strike from 8 July, the company can no longer be assured of sufficient resources being available to ensure safe and stable operations. The Unite union said Tata's statement to shut or pause the blast furnaces three months earlier than intended was the latest in a long line of threats and it would not deter them. The Welsh government said it cannot and will not support the closure of both blast furnaces.

Last week the Unite union announced that about 1,500 workers would begin an indefinite strike on 8 July over the company's plans to cut thousands of jobs. Onay Kasab, the national lead for Unite, told Radio Wales Breakfast that the union was due to have a conversation with the company regarding safety during the strike. Mr Kasab denied if the union had given the company an opportunity to shut the site. ""What other option have we got when we are facing 2,800 job losses. We have said to Tata, again and again, 'wait for a general election, wait for a new Labour government'"" he said. Mr Kasab said the union have a letter from the company asking the union to wait until after the general election for discussions to take place. However, the company previously said it would not be changing course in Port Talbot, regardless of who wins the general election. About 2,800 Tata Steel workers will lose their jobs when the company closes both blast furnaces in Port Talbot by the end of September. At the time, the company said if the strike affected the safety or stability of its operations it would be ""forced"" to accelerate closure plans. A spokesperson for Tata said: ""Following the announcement by Unite union to unilaterally call strike action from 8 July, Tata Steel is unfortunately forced to commence legal action to challenge the validity of Unite's ballot. ""In the coming days, if we cannot be certain that we are able to continue to safely and stably operate our assets through the period of strike action, we will not have any choice but to pause or stop heavy end operations [including both blast furnaces] on the Port Talbot site. ""That is not a decision we would take lightly, and we recognise that it would prove extremely costly and disruptive throughout the supply chain, but the safety of people on or around our sites will always take priority over everything else."" Tata said it is again calling on Unite to withdraw its industrial action and join Community and GMB unions in ""giving consideration"" to the company's proposal, which Tata said includes ""generous employee support packages, training and skills development"". It said it ""understands"" the impact the restructuring will have on many employees and contractors, but that it ""remains committed to a just transition"" and hopes for a ""long and sustainable future"" in the UK. The company plans to build a £1.25bn electric arc furnace to produce steel in a way which is less polluting than traditional blast furnaces but requires fewer workers. Tata said the move would secure the future of steelmaking at the site and the UK government is contributing £500m towards the cost of the project. The plans for the site will see both furnaces shut down. Number five will go off by the end of next week as planned while four is due to go off by the end of September. Preparatory work to shut down five will begin by 1 July if the strike goes ahead. Other elements that will close include the harbour, sinter plant, ore yards and primary steelmaking.

PA Media Unite union workers are protesting against Tata Steel's plans to cut 2,800 jobs

Sharon Graham, the Unite general secretary, said the union is ""fighting for the future of the steel industry"". She said Unite has secured ""serious investment"" from Labour to safeguard jobs. ""Tata putting out a statement to shut or pause its blast furnaces three months earlier than they intended to is the latest in a long line of threats that won't deter us. ""The Unite campaign is not about selling jobs, it's about securing the long-term future of steel making in this country for thousands of workers in Port Talbot and South Wales."" Unite said it is calling on the ""real decision makers"" in Mumbai to realise that ""the investment secured will be good for the company and workers."" GMB union said Tata must ""step back"" from this ""irreversible decision"" and instead ""safeguard steelmaking assets"". GMB national officer, Charlotte Brumpton-Childs, said that the upcoming general election could ""change so much"", and that GMB's next actions would be decided by its members. The Community union condemned Tata's ""unacceptable"" decision to bring forward the closure and said it continued to support the Labour Party's call for Tata not to make irreversible decisions before the general election.

Analysis by Ben Price, BBC Wales News

Developments have escalated quickly in the past two weeks. Unite is one of three unions which represents steelworkers and it has so far been the most militant in its action in the face of significant job cuts across Tata’s UK operations. Members are currently working to rule and there’s a ban on any overtime. However, the decision to walk out indefinitely is an escalation which now potentially threatens the early closure of the UK’s largest steelmaking operation in Port Talbot. Tata says it would have no option but to close if the strike goes ahead, but in the meantime the company has filed for an injunction at the High Court to try to prevent the strike happening. It suggests Unite’s ballot on industrial action wasn’t carried out properly. With the action due on 8 July, Tata will need a ruling quickly. The other unions, Community and GMB, say they’ll wait until after the general election before deciding whether to strike too. But having spoken to a number of steelworkers in Port Talbot, the sense is that many don’t want a strike which could cost them the current offer on the table from the company. What happens during the course of the next week could be crucial to the future of thousands of livelihoods, although Tata says no redundancies will be made until the end of September, regardless.

Workers and local people have protested about the closure plans

First Minister Vaughan Gething described the news from Tata as ""extraordinary"" and urged the company to wait for the result of next week's general election. In a statement, Mr Gething said: ""The news that Tata could switch off blast furnaces four and five at Port Talbot next week is extraordinary and will cause huge anxiety for the workforce, their families and the community. ""The Welsh government cannot and will not support the closure of both blast furnaces"". He added that acting whilst the nation went to the polls did not help de-escalate matters. Samuel Kurtz, the Welsh Conservative shadow minister for economy and energy,said it was ""disappointing news that will cause additional distress to communities already dealing with enough as it is"". ""Tata have shown no goodwill to their workforce at what is an anxious time. “The Welsh Labour government have also only paid lip service to Tata's workforce, failing to contribute a penny to the transition board, and UK Labour's manifesto says nothing on what it would do differently to support Port Talbot's steelworkers,"" he added. Luke Fletcher, Plaid Cymru's economy spokesperson, said steel should be brought under the control of the next UK government, which Plaid believes will be led by Sir Keir Starmer. Mr Fletcher said: ""The time has come now for an incoming Labour government to put words into action on steel. ""Save our steel is no good as just a slogan, if we are going to save our steel, nationalisation needs to happen on day one.""","The Welsh government said it cannot and will not support the closure of both blast furnaces.

17 hours ago Share

Getty Images Aer Lingus have now cancelled almost 400 flights

Aer Lingus has confirmed it is cancelling a further 122 flights up until 7 July due to the ongoing industrial action by pilots. The airline has now cancelled almost 400 flights as a result of an indefinite work-to-rule and strike action by pilots. The work-to-rule means not working over time or carrying out any other out-of-hours duties. An eight-hour strike from 05:00 -13:00 local time is planned for Saturday. Aer Lingus said that due to the “indefinite nature” of Irish Air Line Pilots' Association pilots’ industrial action it “must cancel” additional flights up to 7 July.

RTE Dublin Airport on the first day of industrial action

Irish broadcaster RTÉ had reported that the recommendation for an additional strike was made by IALPA on Thursday. However, on Friday afternoon, Capt Mark Tighe, president of the union, said that Ireland's Labour Court has invited both parties in the dispute to return to them on Monday afternoon. ""We are in the process of discussing that and that of course would have relevance to whether or not we escalate the industrial action,"" he told Radio Ulster's Evening Extra programme. ""I’m hoping now that they have noted the seriousness of the situation and that they’ll be able to apply their considerable expertise."" Talks between it and Aer Lingus to resolve the ongoing pay dispute broke down without a resolution on Thursday.

School pupils 'slept on floor'

A group of students and teachers from Shimna Integrated School in County Down who were retuning from a trip to Berlin had their flight home cancelled while they were in the airport. Teacher Luke McWatters, said that their 21:45 flight on Thursday was initially showing as delayed and then, more than two hours after the flight was initially due to take off, they were told it was cancelled. “Trying to ring through to Aer Lingus I was on three different calls to three different agents who, every time I got to a certain way through said: ‘Because you’re a group we can’t do anything for you -you have to contact group Aer Lingus who don’t open until 9am’.” Mr McWatters told the BBC’s Evening Extra programme that he felt they had been “left high and dry”, with no offer of accommodation or food.

Luke McWatters Luke McWatters said support from the airline ""fell short"" of what was expected

He said the group slept on the airport floor. Mr McWatters said they were offered an alternative flight on 1 July. “At that stage we made the call to try other airlines and split ourselves up as a group,” he added. Half of the group travelled to Edinburgh, while the other half caught a flight to Poland, with both groups booked on flights back to Ireland on Friday. Mr McWatters said that the support for Aer Lingus had “fallen very short of what you would expect from a major airline dealing with children”. The BBC has contacted Aer Lingus for a response.

'Reasonable pay claim'

Capt Tighe said ""passengers are extremely dear to us as pilots. Management don’t meet you, we do every day. ""We’ve been left in a position where our pay is being eroded and all we’re looking to do is maintain our pay."" Speaking to BBC News NI's Good Morning Ulster programme on Friday, Capt Tighe said in an effort to resolve the dispute, the union had said it would accept less than an inflationary rise. ""We don’t believe anybody should be getting less than inflation, but yesterday in an effort to resolve this, we said we would accept less than inflation."" However, he added: ""We believe inflation is a very reasonable claim in this current time.""

PA Media IALPA President Capt Mark Tighe said the Labour Court has invited both sides to further discussions on Monday

Additional strike action?

IALPA had recommended to trade union Fórsa that the additional strike should be longer than the action planned for Saturday, RTÉ has reported. If sanctioned, Fórsa will have to give seven days’ notice to Aer Lingus before pilots can stop work. Aer Lingus has described the potential of further strike action as ""entirely inappropriate given the request of the Labour Court this week that the dispute should not be escalated"". Donal Moriarty, Aer Lingus' chief corporate affairs officer, said the airline is ""willing to go back to the Labour Court on a formal joint referral basis"". He said Aer Lingus has encouraged IALPA and Fórsa to ""agree to this step"".

How many Aer Lingus flights have been cancelled?

All Aer Lingus UK regional flights, operated by Emerald Airlines, and Aer Lingus UK transatlantic flights to and from Manchester will operate as scheduled. A full list of cancelled flights can be found on the airline's website.

How much are Aer Lingus pilots paid?

Co-pilots can start out at about €36,000 (£30,400), with packages increasing based on actual flying hours. Irish broadcaster RTÉ has reported a captain at the top of the scale can be paid about €287,000 (£242,000). Capt Mark Tighe explained on Thursday that this can take up to 26 years. There are differences for pilots depending on whether flights are short or long-haul.

Speaking at an inquiry into the Horizon scandal, Mr Jenkins was accused by lawyer Flora Page of ""protecting"" it when he gave evidence as an expert witness between 2010 and 2013. Ms Page represents Horizon victims including former sub-postmaster Seema Misra, who Mr Jenkins gave evidence against in 2010. Ms Misra told the BBC the system was a monster which ""had blood on its hands, and so do the people who protect [it]"".

Between 1999 and 2015, the Post Office prosecuted hundreds of sub-postmasters on the strength of faulty Horizon data, with 700 convicted of offences such as theft and false accounting. Horizon falsely flagged discrepancies in accounts, with many sub-postmasters using their own savings to make good the imaginary shortfalls. The wrongful prosecutions, which have been called one of the biggest British miscarriages of justice, had a devastating effect on the lives of the sub-postmasters affected. They faced financial ruin and the loss of standing in their communities. Some sub-postmasters ended up taking their own lives after being pursued by the Post Office for supposed losses, including Martin Griffiths, whose widow was later paid in instalments by the Post Office for her silence, the inquiry heard in April.

Giving his fourth day of evidence at the inquiry into the Horizon scandal, Mr Jenkins was questioned by Ms Page, a barrister who represented Horizon victims including Seema Misra. Ms Misra was pregnant with her second child when she was convicted of theft and sent to jail in 2010. She later told the BBC she would have killed herself had she not been pregnant at the time. In a charged atmosphere at the hearing, with Ms Misra sitting next to her, Ms Page accused Mr Jenkins of being a ""Fujitsu man"". She said Mr Jenkins ""knew the Misra trial was a test case for Horizon"". Ms Page alleged his role was to make sure Horizon had a ""clean bill of health"" and that he had ""tailored"" his evidence accordingly. ""My role was to tell the truth,"" Mr Jenkins said. ""I attempted to answer as best I could the questions I was asked"". Ms Page responded: ""Never mind whether a by-product of protecting the monster was that a woman was sent to jail"". Mr Jenkins said he was ""sorry for had happened to Mrs Misra"" but he felt that was down the to way that the Post Office had behaved and wasn't ""purely down to me"". ""I clearly got trapped into doing things I shouldn't have done, but that was not intentional on my behalf,"" he said.

Mr Jenkins was part of the Fujitsu team that developed the Horizon software, and part of his role was dealing with bugs in the system. Mr Jenkins has maintained throughout his evidence that he didn't understand his previous duties as an expert witness to tell the court about problems with Horizon, and that he didn't know that he shouldn't just narrowly answer questions about the technology. Under questioning at the inquiry on Friday, Mr Jenkins said: ""I appreciate that I got things very wrong, but it was done through ignorance rather than maliciousness"". He added that the Horizon system ""as a whole was working well"". Mr Jenkins is currently being investigated by the Metropolitan Police on suspicion of perjury - lying to a court, and perverting the course of justice. No criminal charges have been brought.","Fujitsu expert: I didn't think Horizon was a monster21 hours ago By Tom Espiner , BBC business reporter ShareBBCFormer Fujitsu engineer and Horizon expert Gareth Jenkins has said he didn't think the software was ""a monster"" and that he was ""trapped into doing things I shouldn't have done"".

Slow economic growth and three major economic shocks have meant households' disposable incomes have grown very slowly since 2010, according to a think tank report. Typical household incomes went up by just £140 a year, new analysis from the Resolution Foundation showed. That is a total rise over the 14 year period of just 7% - or an average of half a percent a year - in the amount people had left over to spend after paying tax. By contrast, disposable incomes rose 38% over the 14 years up to 2010, the poverty-focused think tank wrote. However, poorer households had seen stronger income growth than richer ones, it said. The Resolution Foundation said the 2008 financial crisis, the Covid pandemic and high inflation had all contributed to the slowdown, but that growth in general had also been ""sluggish"". That resulted in income rises ""slowing to a crawl"" it said, hampering progress in reducing poverty levels. The state of the economy, and especially the squeeze on ordinary families through the cost of living crisis, is a central theme in the general election, with the Conservatives defending their record in government since 2010.","Incomes have risen 'at a crawl' says think tank19 hours ago By Faarea Masud and Lucy Hooker , Business reporters, BBC News ShareGetty ImagesSlow economic growth and three major economic shocks have meant households' disposable incomes have grown very slowly since 2010, according to a think tank report.

Nike shares plunged more than 12% in after hours trading

Nike has said it expects a surprise 10% drop in quarterly revenue, as it faces growing competition from newer rivals such as On and Hoka.

The news sent Nike shares plunging more than 12% in after hours trading, which could mean a loss of $15bn in market value if the losses hold on Friday.

The world's largest sportswear company also told investors it is facing weakening demand in international markets, including in China.

But Nike is optimistic that new products and a marketing campaign at the upcoming Olympic Games in Paris will help the company regain momentum with consumers.

""The Paris Olympics offers us a pinnacle moment to communicate our vision of sport to the world,"" CEO John Donahoe said on the earnings call.

The company also lowered its outlook for the 2025 fiscal year.

It said direct-to-consumer business declined 8%, as some customers went for more trendy upstart brands.

""There's a sense that Nike just hasn't innovated enough, it hasn't marketed enough, it hasn't told enough stories around its products,"" the Managing director of GlobalData Retail, Neil Saunders, told the BBC.

The sportswear giant's strategy to sell its products through its own stores and website instead of wholesales like Foot Locker hurt sales, Reuters said.

""Nike needs to get on the front foot again in terms of persuading people to buy its products,"" Mr Saunders added.

Nike is currently the top sponsor of jerseys at the UEFA Euro 2024 football tournament, beating out brands like Adidas and Puma.

Prosecutors say through their actions the employees avoided losses ranging from $24,000 to more than$108,000.

Three employees of subsidiaries of HYBE, the agency behind K-pop superstars BTS, have been charged with insider trading by South Korean prosecutors.

They are being accused of selling shares in the agency before BTS members announced they were taking a break on 14 June, 2022.

The announcement sent HYBE shares plunging 25% when markets opened, resulting in a loss in market value of nearly 2 trillion won ($1.4bn; £1.1bn).

The prosecutors said the three employees acted with prior knowledge of what was about to happen, avoiding losses ranging from $24,000 to more than $108,000.

At the time, many analysts speculated about the reasons for the hiatus, with some saying the band members would have to attend South Korea's mandatory 18-month military service.

South Korea is still technically at war with North Korea, so nearly all able-bodied men are obliged to enlist for 18 months by the time they turn 28.

All members of the band would end up being drafted in the months and years that followed.

The oldest member of the hit boy band, Jin, was discharged earlier this month after completing his service.

The other six - J-Hope, V, RM, Jimin, Jung Kook and Suga - are still serving and the band is expected to reunite only in June 2025.

Fans of the wildly popular boyband are hoping Jin's return is also the beginning of BTS' return from its hiatus.","K-pop agents charged with insider trading over BTSProsecutors say through their actions the employees avoided losses ranging from $24,000 to more than$108,000.

An electric car battery developed by UK start-up Nyobolt has successfully charged from 10% to 80% in four minutes and 37 seconds in its first live demonstration.

It was achieved with a specially-built concept sports car on a test track in Bedford, and is part of industry-wide efforts to get electric vehicles (EVs) charging more quickly.

By comparison, an existing Tesla supercharger can charge a car battery to 80% in 15-20 minutes.

Experts say eliminating so-called ""range anxiety"" is key to increasing uptake of EVs - but also stress the importance of improving the charging infrastructure.

“Developing technology that enables people to charge more quickly, which chimes with the time it currently takes to re-fuel a car – is really important,"" Paul Shearing, Professor of Sustainable Energy Engineering at Oxford University, told the BBC.

But he added there needed to be more chargers of all types.

“People are going to want fast-charging infrastructure, independent of what car they’re using – everyone wants to do this more quickly,” he said.

2 days ago By Natalie Sherman , BBC News Share

EPA Campaigners and family members of those who have died of opioids outside the US Supreme Court

The US Supreme Court has struck down a part of the bankruptcy deal for Purdue Pharma that would have shielded members of the Sackler family from future lawsuits over their role in fuelling the opioid crisis. The Sacklers, who owned and operated the Oxycontin-maker for decades, had agreed to pay $6bn (£4.7bn) towards a wider settlement in exchange for sweeping protections against civil claims related to the addictive opioid. But the nation's top court ruled that granting such protections to the Sacklers, who did not themselves declare bankruptcy was not authorised under law. Sackler family members said they would continue to push for a settlement, warning that the alternative was ""costly and chaotic legal proceedings in courtrooms across the country"". The ruling is a victory for the US government and others who had challenged the deal, arguing that releasing the Sacklers was a misuse of the system. But it raises major questions about the future of the agreement, which had won significant, if mixed, support from many who sued the company and saw it as the only practical way to reach the family's billions for drug treatment and other uses. Ellen Isaacs, whose son Patrick Ryan Wroblewski died of an overdose in 2018 at the age of 33, was one of the family members who had opposed the shield for the Sacklers. She said she was not sure what came next, but was hopeful that justice would be done. ""I'd like to see them held fully accountable,"" she said. ""I'm just so grateful to the Supreme Court right now I can't get beyond that.""

Reuters Oxycontin, often an entryway into harder drugs, such as heroin, has been blamed for driving the opioid crisis

Purdue became a household name in the US as the maker and promoter of OxyContin - a prescription painkiller it promoted as safe, despite being aware it was both highly addictive and widely abused. The company declared bankruptcy in 2019, after it was hit by thousands of lawsuits brought by states, cities and families. It later pleaded guilty to criminal charges, including defrauding health agencies and making illegal payments to doctors. The kind of shield granted to the Sacklers in this deal has been a critical feature of other high-profile settlements, including those involving Boy Scouts of America and the Catholic Church. But courts have been divided as to whether such ""releases"" from liability for third parties like the Sacklers are actually permitted. In asking the Supreme Court to take up the issue, lawyers for the US government said letting it stand ""would leave in place a roadmap for wealthy corporations and individuals to misuse the bankruptcy system"" and escape accountability. Writing for the 5-4 majority, Justice Neil Gorsuch echoed those concerns. ""The Sacklers have not agreed to place anything approaching their full assets on the table for opioid victims, "" he wrote. ""Yet they seek a judicial order that would extinguish virtually all claims against them for fraud, willful injury, and even wrongful death, all without the consent of those who have brought and seek to bring such claims."" The court noted that the Sacklers, who have long denied wrongdoing, ""seek to pay less than the code ordinarily requires and receive more than it normally permits"".

Oxycontin, often an entryway into harder drugs, such as heroin, has been blamed for driving the opioid crisis. Since 1999, a few years after the drug became available, deaths from opioid overdoses have surged eightfold to more than 80,000 annually. Court filings allege the Sackler family was long aware of the legal risks, and withdrew some $11bn from the company in the decade before its bankruptcy. They stashed much of the money overseas, while using some of it to pay company taxes, making recovery difficult. When the Supreme Court heard arguments last year, dozens of protesters opposing the deal showed up, holding signs such as ""my dead son does not release the Sacklers"". But many others had backed the deal, willing to accept the terms if the result was billions of dollars for treatment, as well as $750m that would go directly to opioid victims, estimated at $3,500-$48,000 each.

2 days ago By Tom Espiner , BBC business reporter Share

Alamy Thursday was the third day the inquiry heard from Gareth Jenkins. He will conclude his oral evidence on Friday

A Fujitsu software expert who helped build the Horizon system has said he felt pressurised by the Post Office over evidence he gave in the 2010 prosecution of sub-postmistress Seema Misra. Gareth Jenkins said the Post Office ""clearly"" wanted him to say that ""everything was perfect, and I don't think I actually said that"". However, in an email discussing the case at the time, he said Mrs Misra had ""jumped on the bandwagon"" in blaming Horizon for shortfalls in accounts. Mrs Misra told the BBC that this was an example of a culture that went ""right through the Post Office... [that] Horizon is perfect"".

Mrs Misra was one of hundreds of sub-postmasters and postmistresses prosecuted by the Post Office between 1999 and 2015 on the strength of faulty data from the Horizon accounting system. The technology made it look as though money was missing from Post Office branch accounts when it wasn't. At Mrs Misra's trial in 2010 she was accused of theft and false accounting. The sub-postmistress from West Byfleet, Surrey, was found guilty and sent to prison when she was eight weeks pregnant. Her conviction was quashed in 2021.

Mr Jenkins said he felt, prior to the prosecution, that he was being pressurised by the Post Office to make out that Horizon was ""perfect"" in commenting on a report written by an expert witness for the defence. He added that the management of Mrs Misra's case was ""fairly chaotic"", and that requests from the Post Office legal department had been unclear. Nevertheless, in an email discussing Mrs Misra's case in 2010, he wrote that Mrs Misra ""saw an article in [tech publication] Computer Weekly indicating that Horizon was unreliable and decided to jump on the bandwagon"". Mr Jenkins said this was ""totally inappropriate wording"" and apologised. Lead counsel for the inquiry Jason Beer asked Mr Jenkins whether he had been able to give evidence dispassionately, or had he been ""afflicted"" with the belief that sub-postmasters were jumping on the bandwagon in blaming Horizon for shortfalls. Mr Jenkins said that he didn't think Horizon was the problem, and that there were ""other reasons"" for shortfalls. Responding to Mr Jenkins' evidence, Mrs Misra said she felt that the former Fujitsu engineer's comments showed the culture in the Post Office at the time, which was that sub-postmasters were to blame for shortfalls, rather than Horizon being at fault.

Guidance sought

The inquiry was also shown an email sent on 27 January 2010 where Mr Jenkins had read a report on a separate prosecution and wrote that Horizon data “probably needs some further investigation”. However, he said the decision to do so would be “highly political”. ""We don't really want to be seen to be undermining a Post Office prosecution!"" he wrote. Mr Jenkins said he wanted guidance from senior management on ""what exactly we should be doing"". Mr Beer asked: ""Why did you need guidance on whether or not Fujitsu should just present the facts irrespective of whether they supported or undermined a Post Office prosecution?"" Mr Jenkins replied: ""The guidance I got was to just tell the truth, which is what I would have liked to have done anyway."" ""Did you need guidance from management on whether you should tell the truth or not?"" Mr Beer asked. Mr Jenkins said he would just tell the truth, but said he needed guidance from management on whether he was covered by management in this.

Delia-Ioana/BBC News Delia-Ioana said she can't imagine being able to afford a mortgage

The average cost of renting privately in England has risen by nearly a quarter since the last general election. In December 2019 rent cost £1,064 a month on average according to the Office for National Statistics (ONS). By May 2024 this had risen by 22% to £1,301 for new and existing tenancies. Renters have told the BBC they have settled for mouldy properties, sofa-surfed or moved back in with relatives. The National Residential Landlords Association blamed a “chronic shortage” of private rental homes on high interest rates prompting landlords to leave the market. Hundreds of people have been in touch with the BBC about rent via Your Voice, Your Vote.

'All of us have been homeless'

Delia-Ioana, a 24-year-old freelance production assistant, pays £567 per month for a flat share in Bristol. She said it took eight months for a dripping tap to be fixed, impacting her water bills, and the walls were mouldy and damp with mineral deposits. Delia-Ioana plans to move out soon, but said rent was often too expensive, and she worried about the future. “I was looking at my friends – all of us have been homeless at some point. A floor here, a sofa there,” she said. “How are we going to afford to have children if we can’t afford a house?” Average rents in Bristol rose 34% between December 2019 and May 2024, from £1,312 to £1,759 per month, the eighth largest increase among local authorities in England.

Why has rent been increasing?

Between December 2019 and May 2024, average private rent in England rose by 22% according to the Office for National Statistics (ONS). It used a ""geometric average"" to account for differences in property types and changes in the rental markets. Across a similar period (April 2019 to April 2024) the Institute for Fiscal Studies estimated UK earnings rose by 4-6% in real terms. The Bank of England started raising interest rates in December 2021, pushing mortgages up. It has kept them at 5.25% since last summer, aiming to slow the pace of rising prices. Richard Donnell, property company Zoopla’s executive head of research, said these increases have made it harder for potential first-time buyers. According to Mr Donnell there are fewer private landlords, meaning the total number of rental homes in the UK has barely changed since 2016 - but demand has continued to soar. “The big increase in demand happened after the pandemic ended and the economy reopened,"" he said. ""You had this big return of people to cities, the international borders reopened.” He said the growth of working from home has made cheaper areas outside big cities more appealing.

Where has rent increased the most?

London has the highest average rent in England. But Tameside in Greater Manchester saw the largest percentage increase, up by more than 40% - from £555 in December 2019, to £780 in May 2024. Six Greater Manchester local authorities were among the areas with the biggest percentage rises in England.

'It was like a bidding war'

Luisa, a civil servant renting in Tameside, lived with her two adult children in a three-bedroom house for £695 per month in 2022. On 25 September that year, her landlord sent her a letter saying he was selling the property. He cited government decisions, interest rate increases, rising insurances and legislation he said unfairly tackled landlords. Two days earlier, then Prime Minister Liz Truss’s chancellor Kwasi Kwarteng shared a ‘mini budget’ intended to stimulate economic growth. This included £45bn of unfunded tax cuts - now mostly reversed. Following this, inflation and interest rates increased. A Liberal Democrat spokesperson blamed ""Liz Truss' botched budget"" for ""driving up rents for tenants"" and a Labour spokesperson said ""time and time again, the Tories have failed to stand up for renters"". A Conservative Party spokesman said “Covid and the war in Ukraine hiked up inflation and put pressure on renters, but we have got inflation down to normal levels”, adding they were committed to creating a fairer market for renters. Luisa spent four months looking for somewhere to live. “People were offering over the asking price or six months’ rent up front. I wasn’t in a position to do that,” she said. “It was like a bidding war – I’d turn up and there was a block viewing with about eight to 10 different people there.” Luisa rented the sixth house she viewed for £900 per month. She said: “I feel sorry for my children because my daughter’s 20 and at uni, my son is 26 – he has to help me out with rent. He’s unable to save up for his future.”

PA Media Surfers in Aberdeen stage a protest on the beach calling for an end to new oil and gas licensing

""Do you support new oil and gas licences, yes or no?"" That's the binary question which has been at the centre of the political debate in Scotland since parties began preparing to fight the general election. Political leaders have been hurling accusations that 100,000 jobs in Scotland will be at risk if no more licences are issued. But that figure is 40,000 more than the total number of people in Scotland whose roles currently rely directly or indirectly on fossil fuel extraction. And analysis by BBC Scotland News suggests that new licences will only extend the life of the North Sea by up to five years at today's production levels. The North Sea Transition Authority (NSTA) - which issues licences - estimates that about two billion barrels of ""unlicenced"" oil remains. Last year the industry produced 440 million barrels.

Environmentalists have been campaigning for governments to stop issuing exploration licences which allow oil companies to search for new discoveries of fossil fuels. The industry says without new oil finds, the rate at which the sector declines will accelerate - putting jobs at risk. It is now 25 years since production peaked in the North Sea. In 1999, the equivalent of about 1.7 billion barrels of oil and gas was pumped ashore. Output had dropped to 884 million barrels by 2010, then plummeted further to 552 million in 2022, a fall of about 67% on peak levels. Government predictions suggest output will halve again by 2030 to 251 million barrels and fall as low as 58 million by 2050 - which is just 3% of peak production. That's because when the oil boom came we targeted the biggest reserves first which were easiest to exploit.

Nowadays, operators are focused on the remaining smaller wells and using much more advanced - and expensive - techniques to extract it. While the North Sea Transition Authority estimates that the UK has around 10 to 15 billion barrels of oil and gas remaining, only about two billion are in areas where the UK government has so far not issued licences for operators to explore. The suggestion that 100,000 North Sea jobs could be at risk without new exploration licences came from Aberdeen and Grampian Chamber of Commerce. Using data from the investment banking firm Stifel, it produced a report last month saying the next Westminster government had ""just 100 days to save 100,000 jobs"" in the industry across the UK. During the general election campaign the Conservatives and SNP have repeatedly asserted that by promising to end exploration licences, their opponents risk 100,000 Scottish jobs.

Renewables industries like offshore wind are expected to ramp up this decade

The Conservatives fully support continued licences while the SNP say applications should be considered on a case-by-case basis. Labour has said it will issue no more licences and the Liberal Democrats believe the focus should be on creating more jobs in renewable energy like wind power. The Scottish Greens would go furthest of all, by rescinding recently issued licences including 54 which were granted in October and January. Offshore Energies UK estimates that there are now only 60,700 people in Scotland who work directly or indirectly in oil and gas. That number rises to 120,000 across the UK as a whole. Research by Robert Gordon University (RGU) estimates that in the worst case scenario the number of oil and gas jobs lost in the UK by 2030 could reach 60,000. It predicts that even on a best case scenario, with new licenses continuing and investment returning, some 33,000 jobs will still go as a result of falling oil and gas production. So by their estimate, the actual number of jobs ""at risk"" is 27,000 across the whole UK, not just Scotland.

Richard Cuevas claimed he witnessed substandard work on a crucial section of the Boeing 787

An aircraft mechanic who was contracted to repair Boeing planes has alleged he was labelled a ""snitch"" and then sacked for speaking up over safety concerns.

Richard Cuevas claimed he witnessed substandard manufacturing and maintenance work on a crucial section of Boeing 787 aircraft.

Boeing, which has been dogged by questions over whether its safety culture is rigorous enough, said the issues had been investigated and ""did not present a safety concern"".

Lawyers representing Mr Cuevas alleged he reported critical issues that could create a serious public safety risk and has filed complaints with the Federal Aviation Administration and the Occupational Health and Safety Administration.

Mr Cuevas, who has worked in the aviation industry for 40 years, was contracted to Spirit Aerosystems, to work on Boeing's 787 forward pressure bulkhead, a dome at the nose of the aircraft which serves as a barrier.

“He recognised the substandard work and expressed concern,"" Mr Cuevas' lawyers said. ""But Spirit and Boeing failed to stop the faulty manufacturing processes.""

According to the legal filings a colleague then remarked: “We’ve got a snitch among us.”

Mr Cuevas said he was sacked by Spirit Aerosystems in March 2024.

Boeing told the BBC: “A subcontractor’s employee previously reported concerns to us that we thoroughly investigated, as we take seriously any safety-related matter.""

However, the issues raised were found not to present a safety concern and had been addressed, Boeing said.

Spirit Aerosystems spokesperson Joe Buccino, said the firm was ""looking into the matter"".

""We encourage all Spirit employees with concerns to come forward, safe in knowing they will be protected,” he said.

Mr Cuevas' lawyers Debra Katz and Lisa Banks have previously represented another Boeing whistleblower, Sam Salehpour, who earlier this year told US Congress he had been harassed and threatened after he alleged there were quality problems at Boeing.

Mr Salehpour's concerns were also focused on production of the Boeing 787 model.

That is a different model to the 737 Max which was involved in mid-air cabin blow out in January.

That incident prompted heightened scrutiny of Boeing's safety standards.

In April, Boeing said that it had seen a sharp increase in employees speaking up after it gave assurances there would be no retaliation for doing so.

Boeing said that signalled progress towards ""a robust reporting culture"".

""We continue to put safety and quality above all else and share information transparently with our regulator, customers and other stakeholders,"" the company said.","Mechanic claims sacked for raising Boeing concernsRichard Cuevas claimed he witnessed substandard work on a crucial section of the Boeing 787An aircraft mechanic who was contracted to repair Boeing planes has alleged he was labelled a ""snitch"" and then sacked for speaking up over safety concerns.

Job aspirants speak to a hiring agent outside the Foxconn factory near Chennai

Neither Apple nor the Tamil Nadu state government responded to requests for comment from Reuters.

Foxconn said in a statement it ""vigorously refutes allegations of employment discrimination based on marital status"".

The federal labour ministry says the law ""clearly stipulates that no discrimination [is] to be made while recruiting men and women workers"".

A Reuters investigation alleged that Foxconn had excluded married women from jobs at its main India iPhone plant near Chennai, citing their greater family responsibilities compared to unmarried women.

The Indian government has sought a detailed report from Tamil Nadu state following media reports that Apple supplier Foxconn was allegedly rejecting married women for iPhone assembly jobs.

The BBC has also reached out to the Tamil Nadu labour department for a response.

Foxconn, the largest supplier of Apple iPhones, set up its first factory in Tamil Nadu in 2017 but has since been aggressively expanding its operations in India.

In 2023, it began assembling the iPhone 15 in the state and earlier this year, Foxconn tied up with Google to make Pixel smartphones in Tamil Nadu.

The company said it does not stand for discrimination in hiring or recruitment.

In a recent round of recruitment, 25% of women hired were married, according to the company.

It did acknowledge that 20 job ads posted by hiring agencies were removed in 2022 because they ""did not meet our standards"".

The discriminatory practices detailed in the Reuters investigation allegedly took place in 2023 and 2024.

""When we see an issue we act, including corrective action up to and including termination of the hiring agency,"" Foxconn added.

Rights activists say the reports about the firm's hiring practices in India are concerning, given that thousands look to its factories for employment opportunities.

Reuters said it spoke to numerous employees and Foxconn hiring agencies for the story.

The report said that hiring agents and Foxconn HR sources ""cited family duties, pregnancy and higher absenteeism as reasons why Foxconn did not hire married women at the plant"".

This is not the first time the firm has come under scrutiny for its labour practices.

In 2018, a US-based rights group had accused the firm of overworking and underpaying temporary workers at its factory in China that manufactured products for Amazon.

In 2022, its iPhone factory in China saw protests by workers who claimed that they had not been paid certain dues.","India reviews iPhone factory for 'not hiring married women'Job aspirants speak to a hiring agent outside the Foxconn factory near ChennaiNeither Apple nor the Tamil Nadu state government responded to requests for comment from Reuters.

The factory in Flint may have to close due to the UK government's ban on plastic in wet wipes

The UK government announced new legislation to ban wet wipes containing plastic in April 2024.

The manufacturer said phasing out plastics from its baby wipes had ""long been part"" of its sustainability plans.

Kimberly-Clark said the UK government's deadline to remove plastic from wet wipes by mid-2026 ""significantly limits"" its ability to adapt its processes in time, meaning it may ""no longer be viable"" to keep its site running in Flint, Flintshire.

Hundreds of jobs are at risk after a nappies and wet wipes manufacturer announced it is considering closing one of its sites.

Around 220 people are employed at the factory which makes a range of paper products, including Huggies nappies.

If the closure goes ahead, Kimberly-Clark said the site will stay operational until 2025, and that supporting its staff through the ""complex situation"" is its ""top priority"".

It said it had already removed a significant amount of plastic from its products.

A spokesperson said: ""Most of our baby wipes use a proprietary technology with 70% natural fibres and 30% plastic added to provide the necessary strength to clean and care for babies' skin properly.

""However, we're unable to meet the UK government's deadline of mid-2026 as it significantly limits our ability to adapt our consumer manufacturing processes in Flint in time, which means it may no longer be viable to keep our sites operational.""

The UK government said the ban would reduce plastic and microplastic pollution and ""reduce the volume of microplastics entering wastewater treatment sites when wrongly flushed"".

The Welsh government, which proposed a similar ban before the UK government announced its legislation, said the news was ""disappointing and distressing"" for Kimberly-Clark staff.

A spokesman said: ""Without wishing to pre-judge the outcome of the consultation, our focus is on supporting those who may be affected and supporting them into alterative local employment.""","Hundreds of jobs at risk at wet wipe factoryThe factory in Flint may have to close due to the UK government's ban on plastic in wet wipesThe UK government announced new legislation to ban wet wipes containing plastic in April 2024.

He has since been sued by BHS liquidators FRP Advisory.

The ex-director was imprisoned for six years in 2020 over tax evasion.

A High Court judge said Mr Chappell tried to “plunder the BHS Group whenever possible"" after he bought the company for £1 from Sir Phillip Green in 2015.

Ex-BHS director Dominic Chappell has been ordered to pay £50m to cover losses the firm incurred before its collapse.

At a hearing on Tuesday, Mr Justice Leech said Mr Chappell never had a realistic plan to secure capital for the company when he acquired it.

The judge also said Mr Chappell “should make the payments” outlined, which includes £21.5m for wrongful trading.

He must also pay £17.5m for breach of fiduciary duty and other additional costs.

This takes the total to over £50m but Mr Chappell still faces another fine over a misfeasance or wrongful trading claim.

The amount he has to pay for that will be determined at a later date.

Mr Chappell gave a hand written note to the judge saying he had no legal counsel ""due to lack of funds” and raised health and computer access concerns.

Mr Chappell is a former racing driver and had no retail experience when he bought BHS for £1 in March 2015.

The firm made headlines when it fell into administration with a billion pounds worth of trading liabilities and pension debts in 2016.

Just over a year into the new ownership the chain went under, resulting in 11,000 job losses and a £571m pensions shortfall.

Sir Philip Green was heavily criticised at the time for agreeing to the deal, and later agreed a £363m cash settlement with the Pensions Regulator to plug the gap in the pension scheme.

Earlier this month, two former BHS directors Lennart Henningson and Dominic Chandler were ordered to pay at least £18m to creditors over their role in the collapse of the retailer.

Robin Henry, partner and head of dispute resolution at Collyer Bristow, said: ""The Court has clearly identified Chappell as the person who should take most of the blame for BHS’ losses.""","Ex-BHS director must pay £50m over firm's collapseHe has since been sued by BHS liquidators FRP Advisory.

Thousands of former and current Royal Mail staff are being asked to sell their shares to a Czech billionaire.

On Wednesday morning, Daniel Kretinsky’s investment group, which wants to buy Royal Mail's parent company, published its formal offer online and sent it by post.

Mr Kretinsky can now formally start lobbying investors to accept the offer.

He needs the approval of shareholders of three quarters of the parent company, but this task will be made easier because he already owns 27.5% of it.

Big asset managers including Blackrock, UBS, Vanguard and Schroders own most of the other 72.5% of International Distribution Services (IDS) that Mr Kretinsky does not own.

Meanwhile, Royal Mail staff still collectively own 5.5% of the shares after qualifying staff received 600 shares in the company at the time of its privatisation in 2013. This offer values those staff shares at nearly £200m.

Mr Kretinsky made his fortune in energy companies. He also has stakes in Sainsbury's and West Ham Football Club.

The board of IDS has already recommended that shareholders big and small accept his offer of 370p per share.

This is more than the 315p it is currently trading at and substantially above the 220p it was worth before Mr Kretinsky’s first offer to buy the company.

However, the government still has the ability to block this deal, which it may do given Royal Mail's importance to the UK.","Czech billionaire offers to buy all Royal Mail staff sharesThousands of former and current Royal Mail staff are being asked to sell their shares to a Czech billionaire.

The tie-up will allow VW and Rivian to share technology

German car making giant Volkswagen (VW) says it will invest up to $5bn (£3.94bn) in Tesla rival Rivian.

The deal creates a joint venture that will allow VW and the US-based electric vehicle (EV) maker to share technology.

Rivian shares jumped by almost 50% after the announcement.

The tie-up comes as competition intensifies between EV makers and Western countries move to impose tariffs on Chinese imports.

Under the agreement, VW said it will initially invest $1bn in the electric truck and SUV maker, with another $4bn to be put into the company by 2026.

Founded in 2009, Rivian has not yet posted a quarterly profit. In the first three months of 2024 the company saw a net loss of more than $1.4bn.

VW, like other motor industry giants, has come under pressure from rivals like Tesla and China's BYD as it tries to make the shift from fossil fuel-powered vehicles.

Meanwhile, some EV start-ups have struggled to make headway in the highly competitive market and as higher interest rates hit demand for big ticket purchases.

The partnership will give VW immediate access to Rivian's software allowing the German car maker to use it in its cars.

Motor industry giants like VW have also been facing growing competition from Chinese EV makers, which have been expanding globally.

Earlier this month, the European Union (EU) warned that it will raise tariffs on Chinese EV imports by as much as 38%.

Officials from China and the EU have held talks ahead of a 4 July deadline.

A months-long investigation by the European Commission found that Chinese EV companies had been ""unfairly subsidised"".

In response, China said the tariffs violated international trade rules and described the investigation as ""protectionism"".

The plan came just a month after the US said it will increase import levies on Chinese EVs from 25% to 100%.

This week, Canada said that it was considering a similar move to align itself with allies.

Separately on Tuesday, Tesla said it would recall most of its Cybertrucks sold in the US over issues with their windscreen wipers and exterior trim.

The recalls cover more than 11,000 of the vehicles, which first went on sale at the end of November last year.","VW to invest up to $5bn in Tesla rival RivianThe tie-up will allow VW and Rivian to share technologyGerman car making giant Volkswagen (VW) says it will invest up to $5bn (£3.94bn) in Tesla rival Rivian.

Jailed sub-postmistress does not accept Horizon engineer's apology

A former sub-postmistress who was wrongly jailed while pregnant has rejected an apology from an ex-Fujitsu engineer whose evidence helped convict her.

Seema Misra told the BBC that a statement from Gareth Jenkins was ""too little, too late"".

The Post Office wrongly prosecuted about 700 sub-postmasters between 1999 and 2015 for theft and fraud on the basis of incorrect data from their IT system.

At the inquiry into the scandal on Tuesday, Mrs Misra said she wanted to know ""why on Earth he did what he did"".

While at Fujitsu, Mr Jenkins was involved in the development of the Horizon accountancy software used by sub-postmasters across the UK.

As an expert witness, Mr Jenkins was pivotal in helping the Post Office defend the faulty computer software system in criminal and civil cases.

At Mrs Misra's trial in 2010, he failed to tell the court about a bug in the software that could have undermined the case against her.

Mrs Misra, from West Byfleet, Surrey, was found guilty of theft and false accounting and was sent to prison while she was eight weeks pregnant.

Her conviction was quashed in 2021.","Wrongly jailed sub-postmistress rejects apologyJailed sub-postmistress does not accept Horizon engineer's apologyA former sub-postmistress who was wrongly jailed while pregnant has rejected an apology from an ex-Fujitsu engineer whose evidence helped convict her.

Getty Images Amazon had to defend the use of AI technology in its physical grocery stores

Amazon received critical headlines this year when reports questioned the “Just Walk Out” technology installed at many of its physical grocery stores. The AI-powered system enables customers at many of its Amazon Fresh and Amazon Go shops to simply pick their items, and then leave. The AI uses lots of sensors to work out what you have chosen. You then get automatically billed. However, back in April it was widely reported that rather than solely using AI, Just Walk Out needed around 1,000 workers in India to manually check almost three quarters of the transactions.

Amazon was quick to claim that the reports were “erroneous”, and that staff in India were not reviewing video footage from all the shops. Instead it said that the Indian workers were simply reviewing the system. Amazon added that “this is no different than any other AI system that places a high value on accuracy, where human reviewers are common”. Whatever the exact details of the Amazon case, it is a high-profile example of a new and growing question – whether companies are making over-inflated claims about their use of AI. It is a phenomenon that has been dubbed “AI washing” in reference to the environmental ""green washing"".

But first, a reminder of what exactly AI means. While there is no exact definition, AI allows computers to learn and solve problems. AI is able to do this after first being trained on huge amounts of information. The specific type of AI that has made all the headlines over the past few years is so-called ""generative AI"". This is AI that specialises in creating new content, be it having text conversations, or producing music or images. Chatbots like ChatGPT, Google's Gemini, and Microsoft's Copilot are popular examples of generative AI. When it comes to AI washing, there are several types. Some companies claim to use AI when they're actually using less-sophisticated computing, while others overstate the efficacy of their AI over existing techniques, or suggest that their AI solutions are fully operational when they are not. Meanwhile, other firms are simply bolting an AI chatbot onto their existing non-AI operating software. While only 10% of tech start-ups mentioned using AI in their pitches in 2022, this rose to more than a quarter in 2023, according to OpenOcean, a UK and Finland-based investment fund for new tech firms. It expects that figure to be more than a third this year. And, says OpenOcean team member Sri Ayangar, competition for funding and the desire to appear on the cutting edge have pushed some such companies to overstate their AI capabilities. ""Some founders seem to believe that if they don’t mention AI in their pitch, this may put them at a disadvantage, regardless of the role it plays in their solution,"" says Mr Ayangar. ""And from our analysis, a significant disparity exists between companies claiming AI capabilities, and those demonstrating tangible AI-driven results.""

Sri Ayangar Sri Ayangar says that some start-up bosses feel they just have to mention AI

It is a problem that has quietly existed for a number of years, according to data from another tech investment firm, MMC Ventures. In a 2019 study it found that 40% of new tech firms that described themselves as ""AI start-ups"" in fact used virtually no AI at all. ""The problem is the same today, plus a different problem,"" says Simon Menashy, general partner at MMC Ventures. He explains that ""cutting-edge AI capabilities"" are now available for every company to buy for the price of standard software. But that instead of building a whole AI system, he says many firms are simply popping a chatbot interface on top of a non-AI product.

Douglas Dick, UK head of emerging technology risk at accountancy giant KPMG, says the problem of AI washing is not helped by the fact there not a single agreed definition of AI. ""If I asked a room of people what their definition of AI is, they would all give a different answer,” he says. “The term is used very broadly and loosely, without any clear point of reference. It is this ambiguity that is allowing AI washing to emerge. ""AI washing can have concerning impacts for businesses, from overpaying for technology and services to failing to meet operational objectives the AI was expected to help them achieve."" Meanwhile, for investors it can make it harder to identify genuinely innovative companies. And, says Mr Ayangar: ""If consumers have unmet expectations from products that claim to offer advanced AI-driven solutions, this can erode trust in start-ups that are doing genuinely ground-breaking work.""

Regulators, in the US at least, are starting to take notice. Earlier this year, the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) said it was charging two investment advisory firms with making false and misleading statements about the extent of their use of AI. ""The firm stance taken by the SEC demonstrates a lack of leeway when it comes to AI washing, indicating that, at least in the US, we can expect more fines and sanctions down the line for those who violate the regulations,"" says Nick White, partner at international law firm Charles Russell Speechlys.

Nick White Nick White says that it is good to see US regulators clamping down on the problem","What is 'AI washing' and why is it a problem?

Linköping University It might look basic - but could this be the future of screens?

At first glance, it looks like a relic from the 1980s. A tiny computer screen with flickering, low-resolution text scrolling across it. But this could be the future. The screen was made using perovskite light emitting diode (PeLED) technology. It is radically different to the LED technology used in your smartphone display today, and it could lead to devices that are thinner, cheaper and have longer battery life. Not only that, PeLEDs are very unusual in that they can absorb light as well as emit it, meaning you can use the same material to integrate touch, fingerprint and ambient light-sensing capabilities, says Feng Gao at Linköping University in Sweden. “This is difficult but we think it’s possible."" In today’s smartphones, such functions are carried out by electronic components separate to a phone’s screen itself. In a paper published in April, Prof Gao and colleagues demonstrated their prototype with touch and ambient light sensitivity already working. “It’s a very nice demonstration… it’s very new,” says Daniele Braga, head of sales and marketing for Fluxim, a technology research firm in Switzerland. Though he notes that optimising all the different functions promised here might make it difficult to commercialise this kind of display quickly. Via video call, Prof Gao shows off the latest version of the technology. It is another small screen, but this time the pixels per inch (ppi), a measurement of the sharpness of the display, has been nearly doubled – at 90 ppi. On the screen, a simple animation plays, showing two stick figures fighting. A paper with further details about this prototype has just been published.

It was discovered in the 1800s, but people later realised that they could make other kinds of perovskites that shared the same structure while having different elements or molecules as the components. Depending on the materials chosen, perovskites can be really good at, for example, conducting electricity or emitting light. “By slightly tuning the chemical composition you can cover the full visible spectrum,” says Dr Braga, explaining that making perovskites is a relatively simple and cheap process. “If you think about mass production, this is gigantic.” There are some problems, though. PeLEDs are notoriously unstable – they go bad with exposure to moisture or oxygen, for instance. Loreta Muscarella at VU Amsterdam, a university, is working to develop new kinds of PeLEDs. She says that if you leave a PeLED lying around for a few hours or days, the colour of light it emits will gradually degrade or shift to a less pure version of, say, green, than the green you want. And this undermines the whole point of perovskites. They are desirable in part because they can be tuned to emit a very specific, very pure form of red, green or blue – the key hues required for full colour digital displays.

To keep them stable, PeLEDs can be encapsulated in glue or resin, says Prof Gao. But researchers are still working on ensuring that the technology does not falter over a long period. Dr Muscarella says that traditional LEDs have lifetimes of 50,000 hours or more whereas PeLED lifespans are still in the hundreds to thousands of hours range. It could be years before you buy a commercial product that contains a PeLED, she adds. But there’s a different type of light-emitting perovskite that you might see on the market first. It relies on photoluminescence. This isn’t an LED as such but rather a filter or film-like material that absorbs and re-emits light in a particular colour. In some TV’s on the market today, a coloured filter supplies the crucial red, green and blue colours used in every pixel on the screen. It’s by mixing those colours at different levels that you can get the range of hues required to display a full picture. The red, green and blue filters are lit up by an LED backlight. But today’s filters actually block a lot of that light. Photoluminescent perovskites, in contrast, let almost all the light through, which would mean a big increase in brightness and efficiency. Helio, a British company, is working on this. A video on their website shows how a red or green coloured perovskite film can re-emit blue light as either red or green almost perfectly.

The technology Prof Gao and his colleagues are developing is quite different. They are experimenting with screens that emit light using LEDs which are themselves made with perovskites. These are known as electroluminescent perovskites. Working with them is tricky because they are sensitive to electrical fields and, as mentioned, aren’t very stable. But eventually they could be even more efficient options for lighting up the red, green and blue pixels in a smartphone, tablet or TV screen without any need for colour filters at all. The main advantages of switching to this technology could be in lowering the cost of these devices and in reducing their energy consumption. No-one is quite sure how much less energy a future PeLED display might consume versus, say, an OLED screen, but lab experiments suggest that PeLEDs are already competitive with OLEDs and could one day significantly exceed them in terms of efficiency, says Dr Muscarella.","The screen tech that can do almost anything4 days ago By Chris Baraniuk , Technology Reporter ShareLinköping University It might look basic - but could this be the future of screens?

“They can keep saying that, and we can keep proving them wrong.” That was the response of Saudi Arabia’s Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman in a TV documentary broadcast in July 2023, while talking about scepticism surrounding Saudi Arabia’s flagship construction projects. Almost a year later, some of the doubts are turning out to be true. In recent months, Saudi Arabia has seemingly scaled back plans for its vast desert development project Neom, which is the centrepiece of Vision 2030. This is the economic diversification programme spearheaded by Prince Mohammed, the Gulf state’s de-facto ruler, to transition the country’s economy away from oil-dependency. As well as Neom, Saudi Arabia is also developing 13 other large construction schemes, or “giga projects” as they are referred, worth trillions of dollars. These include an entertainment city on the outskirts of the capital Riyadh, multiple luxury island resorts on the Red Sea, and a cluster of other tourist and cultural destinations.

But low oil prices have impacted government revenues, forcing Riyadh to reassess these projects, and explore new funding strategies. An advisor, who is associated with the government but wished not to be named, tells the BBC that the projects are being reviewed, with a decision expected soon. “The decision will be based on multiple factors,” he says. “But there is no doubt that there will be a recalibration. Some projects will proceed as planned, but some might get delayed or scaled down.” Announced in 2017, Neom is a $500bn (£394bn) plan to build 10 futuristic cities in a desert region in the north west of the country. The most ambitious of them, and the one that has gained all the headlines, is The Line. This will be a linear city consisting of two adjoined, parallel skyscraper walls standing 500m high - taller than the Empire State Building. Yet they will have combined width of just 200m, including the gap between them.

The original plan was that they would extend for 170km (105 miles), and become home to nine million inhabitants. But according to people familiar with the details – and as already leaked to the press - the project developers will now focus on completing just 2.4km by 2030, as part of the first module. When The Line was first announced it was billed as a “carbon-free linear city” that would redefine urban living, with amenities for residents like parks, waterfalls, flying taxis, and robot maids. The city would have no roads or cars, and would be made up of interconnected, pedestrianised communities. It would also include an ultra-high-speed train, with a maximum journey duration of 20 minutes anywhere within city limits. How many of these features will be part of the first phase are unclear. Along with The Line, Neom is also due to include an octagon-shaped floating industrial city, and a mountain ski-resort that will host the Asian Winter Games in 2029. Ali Shihabi, a former banker now on Neom's advisory board, says the targets set for projects under Vision 2030 were deliberately “designed to be over ambitious”. “It was meant to be over ambitious, with the clear understanding that only a part of it would be delivered on time. But even that part would be significant,” says Mr Shihabi.

The scaling back of Neom has put the spotlight on the funding challenges that the Saudi government is facing. Neom is being paid for by the Saudi government through its sovereign wealth entity, the Public Investment Fund (PIF). The official cost to build Neom, $500bn, is 50% more than the country’s entire federal budget for the year. But analysts estimate that it would ultimately cost more than $2tn to execute the full project. Saudi Arabia’s government budget has been in a deficit since late 2022, when the world’s largest oil exporter began slashing production to accelerate global prices. The government has forecast a deficit of $21bn for this year. The PIF is feeling the pinch. It controls assets of about $900bn, but it had just $15bn in cash reserves as of September.

Tim Callen, the former IMF chief to Saudi Arabia and now a visiting fellow at the Arab Gulf States Institute, says that raising capital for Neom and other large-scale projects is a key challenge in the future. “It is going to be increasingly challenging to fund the PIF to the levels that are required for these projects,” Mr Callen says. The Gulf state is tapping other avenues to shore up capital. Earlier this month, it sold roughly $11.2bn worth of shares in its national oil company Saudi Aramco. Most of those proceeds are expected to go to the PIF, which was also the biggest beneficiary when the company went public in 2019. The sale comes amid volatility in oil prices. In July of last year, in an attempt to bolster prices, the Saudi Arabia-led OPEC+ oil producing group of countries curbed production. Riyadh voluntarily cut its supplies by one million barrels a day. However, this month, OPEC+ reversed the decision, and it will gradually start increasing production from October.

According to the International Monetary Fund, the price of a barrel of oil needs to be $96.20 for Saudi Arabia to be able to balance its budget. Brent, one of the main benchmarks for crude, has been hovering around $80 a barrel. The country has also relied on selling government bonds to maintain funding flows for the PIF. The other challenge has been that foreign direct investment has remained far below targets, underlining Riyadh’s struggle to attract funding from private companies and international investors. ‘It’s going to be very difficult to persuade investors to come into projects that they view as being overly ambitious,” says Mr Callen. “It’s unclear where your returns will ultimately come from.” The Gulf state is also funnelling money into sectors such as tourism, mining, entertainment, and sports as part of the economic diversification strategy. In recent years, Saudi Arabia has won the hosting rights for several major international events, such as the football Asian Cup in 2027, Asian Winter Games in 2029, and the World Expo 2030. It has also emerged as the sole bidder for the 2034 FIFA Men’s World Cup. All these projects will require massive investments in the years to come.","In recent months, Saudi Arabia has seemingly scaled back plans for its vast desert development project Neom, which is the centrepiece of Vision 2030.
