CNN,https://www.cnn.com/style/article/kate-moss-glastonbury-fashion-remember-when/index.html,2024-06-28,12:57:05 UTC,Kate Moss’ rain boots at Glastonbury: A fashion moment to remember,"Editor’s Note: Delving into the archives of pop culture history, “Remember When?” is a new series offering a nostalgic look at the celebrity outfits that defined their eras.

CNN —

Remember when Kate Moss wore wellies (that’s rain boots for those outside the UK) to Glastonbury?

As the historic festival once again returns to Worthy Farm, we look back at one of its most memorable fashion moments. After all, no British summer would be complete without copious amounts of mud.

And no one has conquered it quite like Moss.

Some 19 years ago, Britain’s best-known supermodel broke fashion’s proverbial fourth wall and joined the mortals in their muddy squalor. Sure, she’d probably spent the weekend glamping in the festival’s VIP zone. But a filthy field is England’s great leveler – and during those brief, well-photographed walks through the Glastonbury grounds, cigarette in hand, she was just like us.

Until, that is, her choice of practical footwear transformed festival fashion and helped save a heritage boot maker from the brink of obsolescence.

It was the summer of 2005 and Moss was near the height of her powers. Media interest in her festival whereabouts was amplified by a fixation with her then-nascent dalliance with Pete Doherty. But while The Libertines’ frontman certainly looked more at home in the conditions, it was Moss who grabbed the limelight.

Matching a pair of classic black Hunter rain boots with a waistcoat, short shorts and studded belt (and later a glittering tunic), the model was a picture of understated glamor. Below the knee her look was interchangeable with that of a Somerset pig farmer. But above it, she could just have easily emerged from a Chelsea mansion to a well-placed paparazzi ambush.

The images quickly went viral (or as viral as they could in the pre-social media age). The bastion of mid-1990s so-called “heroin chic” had become the face of its slightly older, more respectable cousin: mid-2000s festival chic.

In the process, wellies secured their place in the popular imagination. No longer the preserve of agriculture, they had become a rubbery status symbol best matched with trilby hats, cravats and other questionable noughties accessories. This once-practical boot had morphed into bourgeois badge of honor indicating that the wearer was prepared to “rough it” and still look fabulous (the drug-afflicted rockstar boyfriend remained an optional part of the look).

Suddenly, festival wear became its own category of clothing, something far greater than an amalgam of items you didn’t mind ruining. But an even more profound transformation was also taking place – that of the then-struggling Hunter Boot Limited.

The Scottish brand’s true heyday may have been during the World Wars, when it produced huge quantities of waterproof boots for the front lines. But never before in the company’s then 149-year history had its sensible footwear been so desirable. While one shouldn’t overstate the power of the Moss effect (her endorsement couldn’t save the boot maker from entering administration in 2006), it helped set in motion a remarkable turnaround in the company’s fortunes.

By 2007, the firm was under new ownership and reporting an 85% increase in year-on-year sales. It has since become a bona fide festival fixture, producing rainwear, outerwear and boots in all manner of colors and styles.

Once prized for keeping gangrene at bay in the trenches, Hunter has completed the ultimate 21st-century transformation to become the rainy-day boot de jour for celebrities from Rita Ora to Rihanna, Cara Delevingne to Alexa Chung.

And to think that all Kate wanted was a pair of snug, dry feet.","CNN —Remember when Kate Moss wore wellies (that’s rain boots for those outside the UK) to Glastonbury?

CNN —

The teenage cousin of the gunman responsible for the 2022 Uvalde, Texas, school shooting was arrested Monday on suspicion of threatening to “do the same thing” to a school, according to court documents obtained by CNN.

Nathan James Cruz, 17, was arrested on a felony charge of making a terroristic threat to a public place and a misdemeanor charge of making a terroristic threat against a family member, according to Bexar County Central Magistrate records.

Nathan James Cruz Bexar County Sheriff's Office

Cruz is the cousin of Salvador Ramos, the 18-year-old who fatally shot 19 children and two teachers at Robb Elementary School in May 2022, San Antonio police Sgt. Washington Moscoso told the New York Times on Monday.

CNN has sought comment from San Antonio police.

Ramos stormed into Robb Elementary last year armed with an assault rifle and tactical vest and opened fire on two adjoining classrooms – perpetrating one of the deadliest school shootings in modern US history. Law enforcement’s response has been heavily scrutinized, as officers waited outside the classrooms for more than an hour before entering and fatally shooting Ramos.

Cruz’s mother contacted police on Monday after her daughter reported that Cruz said he planned to “do the same thing” as his cousin, according to an affidavit obtained by CNN.

His mother told investigators she was “especially concerned because the suspect is currently on probation, was intoxicated at the time” and because the family lives across the street from an elementary school, the affidavit states.

Cruz’s sister told investigators that while she was giving her brother a ride, he “threatened to shoot her in the head and stated he would ‘shoot the school,’” according to the affidavit.

The mother allegedly overheard a phone conversation in which Cruz was attempting to illegally acquire an AR-15-style assault rifle – the same style used by Ramos to carry out the Uvalde shooting, according to the affidavit.

Following his arrest, Cruz “denied making any threats” when interviewed by a detective, the document states.

CNN has been unable to confirm whether Cruz has an attorney. His charges carry a combined $160,000 bond, according to the magistrate records.","Editor’s Note: (6/27/24) Since this story was published in August 2023, the case against Nathan James Cruz was dismissed due to a missing witness, according to court records in Bexar County, Texas.

CNBC,https://www.cnbc.com/2024/07/01/chewy-shares-rally-20percent-after-sec-filing-reveals-roaring-kitty-keith-gill-has-6point6percent-stake.html,2024-07-01,12:58:18 UTC,Chewy shares rally more than 10% after SEC filing reveals ‘Roaring Kitty’ Keith Gill has 6.6% stake,"The filing showed Roaring Kitty, whose legal name is Keith Gill, bought just over 9 million shares — amounting to a 6.6% stake in the company. That makes him the third-biggest Chewy shareholder, according to FactSet. Based on Friday's close, that stake is valued at more than $245 million.

Shares of Chewy popped in premarket trading Monday after a Securities and Exchange Commission filing showed meme stock trader ""Roaring Kitty"" took a stake in the pet food e-commerce retailer.

The SEC filing also included a section that read: ""Check the appropriate box to designate whether you are a cat."" There was an ""x"" next to a response that read: ""I am not a cat."" This line was included in Gill's statement in a series of congressional hearings about 2021's GameStop trading mania.

The stock was up more than 10% before the bell.

Chewy shares took a wild ride last week after Gill posted a picture on social media platform X of a cartoon dog that resembled Chewy's logo. Shares were up as much as 34% on Thursday but ended the day down slightly.

CNBC emailed Chewy PR seeking comment on the new shareholder.

Gill is known to be a champion of GameStop and has been stirring up trading in the video game company in the last few months. In mid-June, he disclosed a stake of 9.001 million GameStop shares after exiting his massive call options position. It's unclear if he sold his GameStop bet to fund the purchase of Chewy.

GameStop shares fell over 7% in premarket Monday following the news.



There's a big connection between GameStop and Chewy. GameStop CEO Ryan Cohen was the founder and CEO of Chewy, who was instrumental in PetSmart's takeover of Chewy in 2017 and its subsequent initial public offering in 2019.

Cohen joined the GameStop board of directors along with two other Chewy executives in January 2021, partly helping fuel the initial GameStop rally. He later took over as GameStop CEO in 2023, leading a turnaround in the brick-and-mortar video game retailer.

In a recent YouTube livestream, Gill said GameStop is in the second stage of a reinvention, and it has become a bet on Cohen himself, who's been leading a turnaround and pivot to e-commerce.

Gill is a former marketer for Massachusetts Mutual Life Insurance. He came into the limelight after successfully encouraging retail investors to buy GameStop shares and call options in 2021 to squeeze out short-selling hedge funds.","The filing showed Roaring Kitty, whose legal name is Keith Gill, bought just over 9 million shares — amounting to a 6.6% stake in the company.

CNBC,https://www.cnbc.com/2024/07/01/boeing-to-buy-spirit-aerosystems.html,2024-07-01,12:12:21 UTC,Boeing agrees to buy fuselage maker Spirit AeroSystems in $4.7 billion deal,"Boeing said Monday that it will buy back its struggling fuselage maker Spirit AeroSystems in an all-stock deal that the plane maker has said will improve safety and quality control.

It said it agreed to pay $37.25 a share in Boeing stock for Spirit, giving the aerospace company an equity value of $4.7 billion. Including Spirit's debt the deal has a transaction value of $8.3 billion Boeing said. Spirit's shares closed Friday at $32.87 a share, giving it a market capitalization of about $3.8 billion.

Boeing in March disclosed it was in talks to acquire the Wichita, Kansas-based company, weeks after a fuselage panel blew out midair from a nearly new Boeing 737 Max 9 on an Alaska Airlines flight, sparking a fresh crisis for Boeing. Spirit makes the fuselages for the 737 and other parts, including sections of Boeing's 787 Dreamliners.

In 2005, Boeing spun off operations in Kansas and Oklahoma that became the present-day Spirit AeroSystems. Boeing accounted for about 70% of Spirit's revenue last year, while roughly a quarter came from making parts for Boeing's main rival, Airbus, according to a securities filing.

Boeing CEO Dave Calhoun, who has said he will step down at the end of the year, on Monday said bringing Spirit in-house will ""fully align"" the companies' production systems and workforces.

""Among the many actions we're taking as a company, this is one of the most significant in demonstrating our unwavering commitment to strengthen quality and make certain that Boeing is the company the world needs it to be,"" Calhoun said in a message to employees.

He said he expects the deal to close mid-2025, subject to approval by regulators, Spirit shareholders and the sale of Spirit's operations dedicated to Airbus planes.

Spirit's CEO, Pat Shanahan, is considered a possible successor for Calhoun.

Airbus, meanwhile, said Monday it has reached an agreement with Spirit so that the European aircraft manufacturer is compensated $559 million by Spirit to acquire its manufacturing lines dedicated to Airbus planes. Those include operations in Belfast, Northern Ireland, where the wings and mid-fuselage of the A220 are produced, A220 pylons in Wichita and A350 fuselage sections in North Carolina.","Boeing said Monday that it will buy back its struggling fuselage maker Spirit AeroSystems in an all-stock deal that the plane maker has said will improve safety and quality control.

A bitcoin exchange that collapsed 10 years ago after being hacked is set to return billions of dollars' worth of the token to users — and it has investors worried. In a few days, bankrupt Tokyo-based bitcoin exchange Mt. Gox will begin paying back thousands of users almost $9 billion worth of tokens. The platform went under in 2014 following a series of heists that cost it in the range of 650,000 to 950,000 bitcoin, or upward of $58 billion, at current prices. The payout follows a protracted bankruptcy process that's involved multiple delays and legal challenges. On Monday, the court-appointed trustee overseeing the exchange's bankruptcy proceedings said distributions to the firm's roughly 20,000 creditors would begin in early July. Disbursements will be in a mix of bitcoin and bitcoin cash, an early offshoot of the original cryptocurrency. While this is good news for victims of the hack who have spent years waiting to be made whole, the price of bitcoin slid to $59,000 last week, in the crypto market's second-worst weekly decline of the year.

CNBC spoke to half a dozen analysts to get their take on what to expect when roughly 141,000 bitcoin — or roughly 0.7% of the total 19.7 million bitcoins outstanding — are returned to Mt. Gox victims this week.

Pressure on bitcoin could pick up

Mt. Gox — short for ""Magic: The Gathering Online Exchange"" — was once the largest spot bitcoin exchange globally, claiming to handle around 80% of all global dollar trades for bitcoin. When it shuttered in February 2014, bitcoin was worth around $600. Today, the world's largest cryptocurrency is trading at about $61,000 per coin. That means users opting to be reimbursed in-kind — that is, in the cryptocurrency itself, rather than the cash equivalent — have seen the value of their coins surge over 10,000% in the last decade. John Glover, chief investment officer of crypto lending firm Ledn, told CNBC the windfall for Mt. Gox users would likely translate to huge sales in bitcoin as investors look to lock in gains. ""Many will clearly cash out and enjoy the fact that having their assets stuck in the Mt. Gox bankruptcy was the best investment they ever made,"" said Glover, who was previously a managing director at Barclays. ""Some will clearly choose to take the money and run,"" added Glover. James Butterfill, head of research at CoinShares told CNBC the overhang of the nearly $9 billion of bitcoin set to be released has ""long been a concern for those with bullish views on bitcoin."" ""Consequently, the market is highly sensitive to any related news. With the announcement that the Trust will begin selling in July, investors are understandably worried,"" said Butterfill.

It wouldn't be the first time bitcoin's moved in reaction to big redemptions of funds locked up in centralized trading platforms. Last month, crypto exchange Gemini returned more than $2 billion worth of bitcoin to users with funds that had been trapped in its Earn lending program, marking a 230% recovery after bitcoin prices more than tripled since Gemini suspended Earn withdrawals on Nov. 16. JPMorgan analysts linked this to negative price action, saying in a research note last week that it's ""fair to assume that some of Gemini creditors, which are mostly retail customers, have taken at least partial profits in recent weeks."" Similarly, JPMorgan analysts expect Mt. Gox customers to be similarly inclined to sell some of their bitcoin to profit from seismic gains for the cryptocurrency. ""Assuming most of the liquidations by Mt. Gox creditors take place in July, [this] creates a trajectory where crypto prices come under further pressure in July, but start rebounding from August onwards,"" they wrote. Separately last month, the German government sold 5,000 — worth approximately $305.8 million as of Thursday's prices — of a 50,000-bitcoin pile seized in connection with the movie piracy operation Movi2k. The funds were sent to various crypto exchanges, including Coinbase, Kraken, and Bitstamp, according to blockchain intelligence firm Arkham Intelligence. Analysts say these crypto liquidations, too, have placed pressure on bitcoin's price.

Mt. Gox customers expected to hang on to their bitcoin

Most analysts agree losses in bitcoin are likely to be contained and short-lived. ""I think that sell-off concerns relating to Mt. Gox will likely be short-term,"" said Lennix Lai, chief commercial officer of crypto exchange OKX. ""Many of Mt. Gox's early users as well as creditors are long-term bitcoin enthusiasts who are less likely to sell all of their bitcoin immediately,"" he said, adding previous sell-offs by law enforcement, including the Silk Road case, did not result in a sustained catastrophic price drop. Butterfill suggested there's enough market liquidity to cushion the blow of any possible mass market sell action. ""Bitcoin has maintained a daily trading volume of $8.74 billion on trusted exchanges this year, suggesting that liquidity is sufficient to absorb these sales over the summer months,"" said Butterfill. According to CCData research analyst, Jacob Joseph, the markets are more than capable of absorbing the selling pressure. ""Moreover, a healthy part of the creditors are likely to take a 10% haircut on their holdings to receive the repayment early, and not all holdings are set to be liquidated on the open market, reducing the overall selling pressure,"" he said.

Recent price moves suggest the temporary impact of the Mt. Gox repayments may already be priced in, Joseph added. Galaxy Digital's head of research, Alex Thorn, believes fewer coins will be distributed than people think, meaning there will be less sell pressure than the market expects. However, he also wrote in May that, even if only 10% of the bitcoin distributed is sold, ""it will have a market impact."" ""Most of the individual creditors will have their coins deposited directly into a trading account at an exchange, making it extremely easy to sell,"" Thorn said. Vijay Ayyar, head of consumer growth for Asia-Pacific at crypto exchange Gemini, said that the overall impact of the Mt. Gox disbursement is likely to be ""dissipated,"" given the recipients of the funds are varied. On the one hand, there are individual holders who will get their bitcoin straight away. Then there's the ""significant amount"" of bitcoin that will be disbursed out to claims funds, Ayyar said. ""Those funds would then need to distribute these out to their LPs [limited partners], hence the whole process could take a while adding a time element to the impact on price,"" he told CNBC.

Macro headwinds behind bitcoin's fall

It's worth noting there are plenty of other reasons behind bitcoin's recent declines. The cryptocurrency had a stunning rally earlier this year, climbing past $70,000 on the heels of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission's approval of the first spot bitcoin ETF.

But investors have remained anxious amid outflows from bitcoin ETFs and sizable market liquidations. The broader macro environment, too, has investors worried. Earlier this month, the Federal Reserve suggested it plans to cut rates just once this year, down from the multiple cuts it had indicated previously. Cryptocurrencies, which are inherently volatile, are particularly sensitive to changes in the interest rate environment. CoinShares' Butterfill said the Fed's new rate forecast was among ""the likely culprits for the recent price decline"" in bitcoin. This, along with other issues, is ""likely to weigh on prices in the lower volume summer months,"" Butterfill said. However, ""the fundamental investment case remains very much intact,"" he added.","In a few days, bankrupt Tokyo-based bitcoin exchange Mt.

CNBC,https://www.cnbc.com/2024/06/29/next-food-and-beverage-trends-include-honey-tinned-fish.html,2024-06-29,12:00:01 UTC,These could be the next big food and beverage trends,"The budding trends in food sound like a return to the diet of cavemen: Fish is the hottest protein, honey is the flavor du jour and game meat is an upgrade to charcuterie boards. That's according to the hundreds of items on display at the Summer Fancy Food Show, a trade show hosted by the Specialty Food Association that has gained a reputation as a place to spot the next big flavors, foods and drinks that will dominate menus and grocery store shelves. The annual show returned to the Jacob K. Javits Convention Center in New York this week, running Sunday through Tuesday. More than 2,400 companies exhibited their foods and drinks for attendees, which include restaurant operators, specialty food retailers and trendspotters. Past show trends that are making their way to mainstream consumers' palettes include yuzu, mushrooms and sophisticated alcohol substitutes. Previous shows have also been a springboard for small brands seeking a wider audience. Honest Tea, Ben & Jerry's and Tate's Bake Shop are among the companies that attended the show in their early days on their way to becoming well-known consumer brands now owned by the industry's biggest players. Here are some highlights from this year's Summer Fancy Food Show:

Honey — as a flavor

Humans have been eating honey for thousands of years, but it's taking center stage as a flavor with some food and beverage makers. In the SFA's preliminary report on the show, its trendspotters called out honey, noting its health benefits. Honey was the star in both foods and drinks across the show. Green Bee showed off its honey soda, which includes a Honeycomb Cider flavor. Owl Creek Organics & Natural Flavors displayed honey spreads, with flavors ranging from caffe mocha to lemon poppyseed. And Dutch company Klepper & Klepper used honey as a flavor for their licorice.

Tinned fish

In years past, tinned fish was relegated primarily to booths in the Spanish and Portuguese pavilions. But this year, exhibitors showed off their tinned fish products across the show floor. TikTok helped fuel the tinned fish trend last year, boosting sales of canned sardines. Now specialty food companies are responding. This isn't the canned tuna of yore. There are more flavors, different seafood varieties and trendier packaging. Wildfish Cannery, an Alaska-based company that was founded in 1987, showed off a new retro design for its sockeye salmon, giving it a more upscale feel. Krill Arctic Foods exhibited its canned krill meat, which may lack the same curb appeal on its packaging but boasts about the food's nutritional profile.

Fish to go

Exhibitors also showed off new ways to eat fish on the go, hoping to capitalize on consumers' desire for convenience and more protein in their diets. The association named ""satisfying snacks"" as one of the trends that it's been watching. Acme Smoked Fish highlighted its new Lox in a Box snack kits, available with cream cheese or avocado. Legend of Master International, an Asian food supplier, sampled its Kani fish cake sticks, made to eat like string cheese or for cooking.

Upgraded charcuterie

Fossil Farms' array of salami flavors, including lamb and bison Amelia Lucas | CNBC

Like tinned fish, the popularity of charcuterie boards owes a lot to social media, where users can dazzle their followers with elaborate displays of preserved meats, cheeses and fruit. Companies at the Summer Fancy Food Show showed off some new options to level up the charcuterie — especially the salami. Tempesta Artisan Salumi offered up black truffle-flavored salami, while Salt & Twine's selection included a mezcal and salted lime flavor. But exhibitors weren't just having fun with the flavors. Some are looking beyond pork to make the cured meat. Driftless Provisions' salami uses elk, venison and bison alongside pork. Fossil Farms' salami lineup included lamb and wagyu beef.

CNBC,https://www.cnbc.com/2024/06/30/democrats-defend-biden-debate-flop-voter-poll.html,2024-06-30,16:58:10 UTC,'Preparation overload': Democrats defend Biden after debate flop as voter support flinches,"Democrat candidate, U.S. President Joe Biden, and Republican candidate, former U.S. President Donald Trump, attend a presidential debate in Atlanta, Georgia, U.S., June 27, 2024.

Democrats are making the rounds on the Sunday media circuit working to reshape perceptions about President Joe Biden after he delivered a stumbling debate performance that left his voters cringing and his party in a damage-control frenzy.

""Yes, it was a bad performance,"" South Carolina's Democratic Rep. Jim Clyburn, a close Biden ally, said on CNN's ""State of the Union."" ""I know when I see what I call preparation overload. And that's exactly what was going on the other night.""

The South Carolina Democrat followed the post-debate spin formula that has emerged from Biden supporters since the Thursday showdown: Acknowledge the fumble and then pivot to critiques of the presumptive Republican presidential nominee, former President Donald Trump.

""Joe Biden should continue to run on his record. I do believe that we will find him when contrasted with the record of the four years of Trump to be exactly what we need going forward,"" Clyburn said.

Former presidents Barack Obama and Bill Clinton followed that structure in similar arguments on Friday.

House Democratic Leader Hakeem Jeffries, Sen. Chris Coons, D-Del., Sen. Raphael Warnock, D-Ga. and former House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., also jumped to Biden's defense on the Sunday media junket.

Despite the full-court press, Biden's Thursday debate performance, marked by several instances where he tripped over his words or trailed off mid-answer, has only amplified voter concerns about his age and fitness to carry out a second presidential term.

A new CBS News/YouGov poll taken between June 28 and June 29 found that 72% of registered voters surveyed do not think Biden should run for president, up from 63% in February. The poll also found that 72% of the respondents do not think that Biden has the mental and cognitive ability to serve as president, a seven percent increase since June 9.

A poll taken so shortly after a major event like Thursday's debate represents a knee-jerk reaction. A more accurate snapshot of public sentiment may emerge as the initial hype dies down and voters have more time to process. The CBS News poll surveyed 1,130 registered voters and had a margin of error of +/- 4.2%.

But those new numbers come in direct tension with Biden's argument that voters are not as down on his debate blunders as much as political pundits.

""I understand the concern about the debate. I get it. I didn't have a great night. But here's what [is] not getting reported: Voters had a different reaction than the pundits,"" the president said at a Saturday campaign event in East Hampton, N.Y. ""Since the debate, polls show a little movement, and we've moved us up, actually.""

Biden and Trump are scheduled for a second debate on Sept. 10, though it is unclear whether both candidates will follow through.

Ultimately, the debate has triggered a Democratic reckoning over whether Biden should remain the presumptive nominee.

Some Democratic strategists, along with newspaper editorial boards across the country have suggested he should step down and forfeit his delegates ahead of August's Democratic National Convention to allow someone else to take on Trump in November.

Biden is at Camp David on Sunday, joined by his family where he is expected to discuss the path forward of his reelection bid, according to NBC News.

In the meantime, the Biden campaign has been raking in large fundraising hauls in the wake of the debate. As of Sunday morning, the campaign had raised $33 million since Thursday, $26 million of which came from grassroots donors, according to Biden campaign spokesperson Kevin Munoz.

Munoz added that nearly half of that grassroots funding came from donors giving money to the campaign for the first time this election season.","Democrat candidate, U.S. President Joe Biden, and Republican candidate, former U.S. President Donald Trump, attend a presidential debate in Atlanta, Georgia, U.S., June 27, 2024.

Pride month is winding down — and this year, the corporate world took a more cautious approach. June tends to bring a wave of rainbow-themed merchandise and affirming ads and social media posts from retailers and consumers brands, coinciding with parades and other events that celebrate the LGBTQ+ community. As the presidential election approaches, however, some companies have grown quieter about diversity, equity and inclusion efforts to avoid stepping into the culture wars or facing the blowback from conservative customers that Target and Bud Light did a year ago. The starkest example of that came late Thursday: Tractor Supply, a retailer that sells animal feed, cowboy boots and lawn supplies in rural parts of the country, said it is ending all spending tied to diversity and environmental causes. That includes no longer sponsoring Pride festivals, the statement said. The move, while an outlier in its magnitude, underscores how some companies that made inclusion commitments in recent years are treading cautiously. It is difficult to track how many companies shared supportive messages, donated to LGBTQ+ causes or sold rainbow-themed merchandise in June compared to previous years. According to Gravity Research, a Washington, D.C.-based reputational research firm, 45% of Fortune 100 companies had at least one social media post on LinkedIn or X explicitly related to Pride as of June 21 this year, compared with 51% last June. Gravity Research President Luke Hartig said the volatility of the presidential election and the two candidates' willingness to call out companies by name has also made companies less likely to go public about their stand. ""There's a little bit of like, 'keep our heads down while we go through this election,'"" he said. Tim Bennett, cofounder of Tribury Productions, a marketing company that specializes in reaching LGBTQ+ Americans, works with Fortune 500 companies, including recent projects with Procter & Gamble. He said more clients have taken ""a wait-and-see"" approach to marketing to LGBTQ+ consumers or decided to scatter efforts throughout the year instead of making a big splash in a single month. ""June this year has not been like the last five or six,"" Bennett said. That may not be a bad thing for LGBTQ+ initiatives and charities. Sarah Kate Ellis, CEO of nonprofit advocacy group GLAAD, said she's seeing more companies get involved with year-round philanthropy and activism in more meaningful ways. She also pointed to a survey by Gravity Research that found that 78% of companies did not plan to change their Pride strategy this year. Thirteen percent were unsure whether they'd make changes and 9% said they planned to revise their strategy. Gravity Research surveyed 45 corporate executives and Fortune 500 leaders across industries in April. ""The visibility of companies putting flags out and having product to celebrate our Pride and to mark a month that's really significant and important for our community is really important, and I don't want to ever devalue that,"" Ellis said. ""I do think, though, those companies must look inside and make sure that they have the policies and the HR practices that match their outward marketing."" Major companies are still writing checks for LGBTQ+ causes, too. A GLAAD spokesperson said Friday that the group has not seen donations or corporate support decline this Pride month, though it does not yet have a total tally. On Friday, when the Stonewall National Monument Visitor Center officially opened its doors to commemorate the New York City bar that was a catalyst in the LGBTQ+ rights movement, the event had major backing from the business community. Supporters included Google, Amazon, JPMorgan Chase and Booking.com. President Joe Biden also made an appearance and remarks at the monument's opening.

The Bud Light and Target effect

Consumer staples brands were the most likely to say they planned to shift their Pride month strategy this year, according to Gravity Research's survey. That may stem from the conservative boycotts of Target and Bud Light last year. Target has carried a Pride collection for over a decade. Yet last year, the big-box retailer removed some items and moved displays after employees faced threats. Boycotters targeted items for transgender shoppers, such as ""tuck-friendly"" swimsuits, and also criticized separate Pride merchandise for kids. Instead of putting Pride merchandise in all stores this year, Target only carried it in the locations that accounted for 90% of total Pride sales in 2022 and 2023. It also stopped selling any Pride apparel for kids. On the company's website and in those select stores, shoppers can find a wide variety of Pride-themed items. The volume of negative feedback to the Pride collection externally and internally is ""significantly lower"" this year than in 2023, according to a Target spokesperson. In a statement, Target said it is ""committed to supporting the LGBTQIA+ community during Pride Month and year-round"" and would participate in Pride events across the country and support LGBTQ+ groups, in addition to offering Pride products.

Anheuser-Busch InBev and other large beer brands, on the other hand, have backed away from public support of the LGBTQ+ community. Conservatives like singer Kid Rock and Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis called for a boycott of the beer and its parent company, Anheuser-Busch InBev, after Bud Light sent personalized cans of its beer to transgender influencer Dylan Mulvaney. The marketing campaign coincided with the March Madness college basketball tournament. Bud Light sales tumbled around 25%, and the brand lost its spot as the best-selling beer in the U.S., ceding the position it held for more than two decades to Constellation Brands' Modelo. AB InBev distanced itself from Mulvaney and fired Bud Light's vice president of marketing. In October, AB InBev CEO Michel Doukeris said the brand would focus its marketing more on events like sports games and concerts. It also returned as the official sponsor of the UFC. In recent months, some consumers have returned to Bud Light, as RBC Europe analysts estimate that the brand's U.S. volume is down only about 10% these days. For its part, Bud Light hasn't posted in support of Pride month on its Instagram or X pages this year. The boycott was unusually sticky for a few reasons, according to Neil Reid, a geography professor at the University of Toledo who researches the beer industry. Studies have shown that consumers' loyalty to top-selling beers may be more tied to the brand than the taste, Reid said. Right-wing news outlets like Fox News also devoted plenty of airtime to the controversy, stretching its duration and potentially reaching new consumers who missed the initial reaction. Plus, once Bud Light sales fell, retailers gave more shelf space to its rivals. ""You can look at this issue from a moral, ethical perspective or you can also look at it from a pure business perspective. Those two often don't result in the same strategy,"" Reid said.

Two couples enjoying a drink at the races.

Millennials are poised to be the wealthiest generation in history, but are they ready to handle the large inflow of money?

A vast $90 trillion wealth transfer over the next 20 years will likely make millennials ""the richest generation in history,"" according to estimates from global real estate consultancy Knight Frank.

It found that the so-called silent generation — those typically born between 1928 to 1945 — and baby boomers — born from 1946 and 1964 — will ""hand over the reins"" to millennials — those born between 1981 and 1996 — when they pass on their assets.

Millennials have been portrayed as lazy and frivolous spenders, more keen to open their purse strings for avocado toasts instead of saving for a house — so just how equipped are they in managing the seismic flow of income?

""The millennials are very ill prepared … they're not as well prepared as the wealth creating generation,"" Salvatore Buscemi, co-founder and managing partner of multi-family office Brahmin Partners told CNBC.

By the time the millennials inherit this wealth, they will be in their 40s and may not have the aptitude for starting their own business or for investing, he elaborated.

""They don't have the skill sets earlier on to be able to do that because they never had to - they were never pushed,"" he said. ""And the problem is - are they going to be motivated later in life to push themselves to acquire these skill sets?"" asked Buscemi, adding that human nature suggests that people are less inclined to pick up new skills as they age.","Millennials are poised to be the wealthiest generation in history, but are they ready to handle the large inflow of money?

There's an army of unsponsored athletes commanding attention at the U.S. Track & Field Olympic Trials this year, decked out in all-black, logo-less gear.

The 35 athletes are supported by apparel company Bandit Running's Unsponsored Project, an effort to challenge the standard sponsorship model for professional athletes and boost up-and-coming competitors.

Unsponsored athletes in track and field would typically purchase their own apparel bearing the emblems of major brands, effectively providing free advertising for the companies. Instead, Bandit Running offers Olympic hopefuls the all-black kits and warmups — along with short-term endorsement deals.

Bandit co-founder Tim West said the company is giving out at least 35 two-week deals for unsponsored runners at the trials, a U.S. Olympian's gateway into the four-year games. The deals consist of unbranded apparel, a platform and cash to cover expenses. Last year, Bandit partnered with nine athletes.

""We're really hoping for a new sponsorship model where brands take a healthy piece of their budget and apply it to the kind of amateur, sub-elite athlete to help grow the sport. I think when you lift up, sort of the bottom, everything pushes up,"" West told CNBC.

Bandit's deals have a built-in release clause, West said, allowing an easy out for athletes who get a traditional sponsorship offer during the trials.

Given the high prices associated with competing, West said unsponsored athletes are ""investing in themselves,"" posing an opportunity for brands to step in and help out.

And, the all-black, logo-free kits help call attention to which athletes may be available to strike a longer-term deal.

Among them is Courtney Okolo, a 400-meter runner.

After winning a gold medal in the 2016 Rio Olympics and being sponsored by Nike for four years, Okolo, 30, is embracing the Unsponsored Project. She said getting support while competing without a sponsorship is difficult, but Bandit's initiative makes it feel like she isn't doing it all on her own.","Christopher Royster, left, and JT Smith, athletes who participate in Bandit Running's Unsponsored Project, at the 2024 Olympic trials in Eugene, Oregon.

CNBC,https://www.cnbc.com/2024/06/30/how-life-expectancy-figures-into-retirement-planning.html,2024-06-30,13:00:01 UTC,How long you may live is one of retirement planning's biggest unknowns. How experts say to get the best estimate,"Peopleimages | Istock | Getty Images

To effectively plan for your retirement, experts say, you need to watch your savings rate and total nest egg. But how much you really need to have set aside depends on another number — your life expectancy. Yet that figure is also the most elusive — no one knows how long they will live. ""Nobody really knows, and that uncertainty is uncomfortable,"" said Lisa Schilling, director of practice research at the Society of Actuaries Research Institute, the research arm of the Society of Actuaries. The financial industry typically uses age 95 as a default assumption, according to research from HealthView Services, a provider of health-care cost projection software. More from Personal Finance:

Why inflation is still upending retirement plans

Older voters want candidates who will protect Social Security

Workers in certain industries tend to have higher 401(k) balances Instead of planning for one life expectancy number, the Society of Actuaries and American Academy of Actuaries emphasize longevity. Longevity risk measures the likelihood someone may live longer than expected and outlive their savings. ""If you read that life expectancy is 84 and you are planning on your money lasting until 84, there's a big surprise behind the curtain that you haven't opened,"" Schilling said. ""There's a really good chance for a lot of reasons that you might need your money to last longer than that.""

Longevity estimates may bring surprises

The Society of Actuaries and American Academy of Actuaries recently relaunched a free online longevity illustrator. The tool asks for basic information on either an individual or a couple: age, sex, retirement age, smoking status and a description of their general health — poor, average or excellent. The results aim to provide a ""reasonable"" estimate of how long you might live, according to the organizations. The illustrations show the probability of living to certain ages, as well as the number of years of life one might live in retirement. Generally, the higher your current age, the greater the possibility you may live longer. While life expectancy at birth may be 84, it will be even longer if you've already made it to age 65, Schilling said.

The results may help individuals fully understand the range of possibilities when planning for how long their money may need to last, she said. For couples, there is also another revelation that often comes as a surprise. ""The chance that at least one of you lives to 90 is even bigger,"" Schilling said. Yet the financial industry's assumption of living to age 95 may be too generous, according to recent research from HealthView Services. The projected life expectancy for someone who is 65 years old today with no chronic conditions is age 90 for women and age 88 for men. Yet only around 5% of people over 60 have no chronic conditions, according to the research.

Health status affects life expectancy projections

Chronic health conditions such as high blood pressure, cardiovascular disease, cancer, diabetes, high cholesterol, tobacco use, obesity or Parkinson's disease reduce an individual's projected life expectancy. For example, while a healthy 65-year-old man with no chronic conditions has a 19.3% probability of living to age 95 or longer, that gets reduced to a 17.5% chance if he has high blood pressure, 15.8% if he has cardiovascular disease, 12.5% for high cholesterol, 8.8% for obesity with a body mass index of 35 to 39, 7.4% for tobacco use, 2% for obesity with body mass index of 40 to 44 and to just 0.4% for diabetes, according to the research. Those probabilities could mean a huge difference to his retirement funding needs. A healthy 65-year-old man may need around $1.1 million to maintain the 80% income replacement rate he needs if he was earning $100,000 in 2023, according to HealthView Services. This assumes he lives to age 95, has a 6% annual portfolio return, receives Social Security benefits, and inflation is 3%.

However, if that 65-year-old man has a chronic condition, his life expectancy will be lower. And that could free up more of that retirement nest egg to be spent in other ways, according to HealthView Services. High blood pressure could reduce his life expectancy by nine years to age 86, and therefore allow for $447,469 to be used for long-term care planning, emergency savings, money for heirs or other uses, the research found. Tobacco use could reduce his life expectancy by 13 years to 82, freeing up $616,245, the research estimates, while diabetes may reduce his lifespan by 16 years, enabling him to spend $727,947. Most experts advise individuals to plan for outliving their assets by delaying Social Security retirement benefits or considering an annuity to amplify monthly income.

U.S. prosecutors plan to seek a guilty plea from Boeing over a charge tied to two fatal crashes of 737 Max planes, attorneys for the victims' family members said Sunday, blasting a potential agreement as a ""sweetheart deal.""

Justice Department attorneys and victims' family members and their lawyers spoke for about two hours on Sunday, discussing the plan, lawyers said.

Boeing declined to comment, and it wasn't immediately clear if it would accept a plea deal. A guilty plea could complicate its ability to get government contracts. Boeing is a major defense contractor.

The Justice Department didn't immediately respond to a request for comment.

The DOJ said in May that it was reviewing whether Boeing violated a 2021 settlement that protected the company from federal charges tied to the 2018 and 2019 crashes of its best-selling 737 Max planes, which killed all 346 people on the two flights. Under that agreement, Boeing said it would pay $2.5 billion.

The DOJ revisited the agreement after a door panel blew out of a new 737 Max 9 midair during an Alaska Airlines flight in January, sparking a new safety and quality control crisis for one of the world's two suppliers of large commercial airplanes. The so-called deferred prosecution agreement was set to expire days before the door panel blew out.

Boeing admitted in 2021 that two of its pilots defrauded the Federal Aviation Administration by concealing its addition of a new flight-control system to the planes before they were flown commercially. That system was later implicated in the two crashes.

The plea deal would require Boeing to pay an additional fine of about $247 million and call for the installation of an outside monitor on Boeing, according to Paul Cassell, one of the lawyers. Cassell called the new deal a ""slap on the wrist.""","U.S. prosecutors plan to seek a guilty plea from Boeing over a charge tied to two fatal crashes of 737 Max planes, attorneys for the victims' family members said Sunday, blasting a potential agreement as a ""sweetheart deal.""

CNBC,https://www.cnbc.com/2024/06/29/biden-campaign-fundraises-27-million-post-debate.html,2024-06-29,16:49:15 UTC,Biden campaign fundraises $27 million after first debate,"US President Joe Biden speaks at the Stonewall National Monument Visitor Center grand opening ceremony in New York on June 28, 2024.

The Biden campaign has raised $27 million starting from the day of the first presidential debate through Friday evening, a campaign spokesperson announced on Saturday.

The number comes in the middle of President Joe Biden's post-debate fundraising swing, during which the campaign is looking to keep pace with former President Donald Trump's recent donation momentum.

The Biden campaign, the Democratic National Convention, and Biden PACs and committees jointly raised $85 million in May, lagging behind Trump's $141 million haul in the same month that the former president was convicted on 34 felony charges.

The post-debate campaign push is also trying to reassure donors that Biden can still deliver a Democratic win come November, despite his fumbling performance at Thursday's first debate against Trump.

After the 90-minute face-off in Atlanta, Biden on Friday headed to Raleigh, North Carolina, to hold a rally where he spoke with a more energetic tone and acknowledged his debate slip-ups.

""Folks, I don't walk as easily as I used to. I don't speak as smoothly as I used to. I don't debate as well as I used to. But I know what I do know: I know how to tell the truth,"" he said.

After North Carolina, the president flew to New York to deliver remarks at the Stonewall National Monument Visitor Center to mark Pride Month. Later that evening, he held several campaign receptions.

Biden will participate in even more campaign receptions on Saturday in New York and New Jersey before returning to Camp David later in the evening. Those events will likely boost the $27 million fundraising figure higher.

The Biden campaign did not immediately respond to a request for comment about how much of this new fundraising came from grassroots donors online versus higher-dollar donors.

Since the 90-minute face-off on Thursday, Democrats have been in a frenzy trying to clean up the mess of Biden's debate flop.

Biden supporters, including former Presidents Barack Obama and Bill Clinton have tried to spin the debate by recognizing, rather than ignoring the president's debate blunders while also asking voters to look past them.

Some Democratic strategists, however, are calling on Biden to drop out of the presidential race and forfeit his delegates to a fresh candidate.

Biden and Trump are scheduled to debate again on Sept. 10, a potential redemption opportunity for the president's perception with voters, many of whom express concerns over his age and ability to handle a second term.","US President Joe Biden speaks at the Stonewall National Monument Visitor Center grand opening ceremony in New York on June 28, 2024.

Biden supporters, including former Presidents Barack Obama and Bill Clinton have tried to spin the debate by recognizing, rather than ignoring the president's debate blunders while also asking voters to look past them.","['campaign', 'president', 'york', 'presidents', 'biden', 'million', 'debate', 'national', 'used', '27', 'know', 'fundraises']",https://image.cnbcfm.com/api/v1/image/107435198-1719608968398-gettyimages-2159064351-AFP_34ZP3MT.jpeg?v=1719608994&w=1920&h=1080,True,us presid joe biden speak stonewal nation monument visitor center grand open ceremoni new york june biden campaign rais million start day first presidenti debat friday even campaign spokesperson announc saturday number come middl presid joe biden postdeb fundrais swing campaign look keep pace former presid donald trump recent donat momentum biden campaign democrat nation convent biden pac committe joint rais million may lag behind trump million haul month former presid convict feloni charg postdeb campaign push also tri reassur donor biden still deliv democrat win come novemb despit fumbl perform thursday first debat trump minut faceoff atlanta biden friday head raleigh north carolina hold ralli spoke energet tone acknowledg debat slipup folk walk easili use to speak smooth use to debat well use to know know know tell truth said north carolina presid flew new york deliv remark stonewal nation monument visitor center mark pride month later even held sever campaign recept biden particip even campaign recept saturday new york new jersey return camp david later even event like boost million fundrais figur higher biden campaign immedi respond request comment much new fundrais came grassroot donor onlin versus higherdollar donor sinc minut faceoff thursday democrat frenzi tri clean mess biden debat flop biden support includ former presid barack obama bill clinton tri spin debat recogn rather ignor presid debat blunder also ask voter look past them democrat strategist howev call biden drop presidenti race forfeit deleg fresh candid biden trump schedul debat sept potenti redempt opportun presid percept voter mani express concern age abil handl second term
CNBC,https://www.cnbc.com/2024/06/30/here-are-our-top-3-and-bottom-3-stocks-during-a-divergent-second-quarter.html,2024-06-30,15:18:01 UTC,Here are our top 3 and bottom 3 stocks during a divergent second quarter,"It was another largely great quarter for the stock market — completing a strong first half of the year for the Dow Jones Industrial Average , the S & P 500 and the Nasdaq , all trading around record highs. The Nasdaq was the big winner of the second quarter, adding 8.26% over the past three months thanks to an artificial intelligence-powered tech rally. The S & P 500 gained 3.92% since the end of March. The Dow, on the other hand, closed out the April through June period in the loss column — ending down 1.73%. The Dow is not as heavily weighted in tech, which was the top-performing sector in Q2. Here's a look at the three best second-quarter performers among the 33 stocks in the CNBC Investing Club portfolio and the three worst. Best Performers NVDA YTD mountain Nvidia YTD Nvidia continued to be the top-performing stock in the portfolio for the second quarter in a row, gaining 36.73%. The major contributor to the upside was a blowout fiscal 2025 first quarter accompanied by strong current quarter guidance. During the post-earnings call in May, the risk of a so-called air pocket in sales momentum as the company transitions to its new Blackwell chip architecture was taken off the table . Management said demand for the yet-to-be-released platform already outstrips supply. Last week, if only briefly, Nvidia became the most valuable U.S. company. After record high after record high, the stock pulled back recently. On Wednesday, at Nvidia's annual shareholders meeting, founder and CEO Jensen Huang took questions and laid out the company's overall strategy to maintain its lead position in enabling AI. AAPL YTD mountain Apple YTD The second big winner was Apple , which rose 22.82% in Q2. The stock didn't do much in the first month of the second quarter. However, all that changed in early May when the company reported solid earnings . Services revenue was better than expected and China was nowhere near as bad as feared. That got the stock going. But the real break out to all-time highs followed the company's AI announcements at this month's Worldwide Developers Conference. Shares took that other leg up, in our view, because Apple Intelligence will only be available on last year's iPhone 15 Pro models or better. That means the vast majority of iPhone users, who we know to be extremely loyal to the brand, have a better reason than ever before to upgrade their devices. We expect many to do so. AVGO YTD mountain Broadcom YTD Broadcom came in third and saw its stock advance 21.13% in April through June. After consolidating for much of the quarter, the stock started jumping earlier this month on strong quarterly results and management raising their outlook for AI-related revenue generation. Investors also came away with increased confidence that the legacy aspects of the business were bottoming and set to rebound into the back half of the year. That confidence also makes sense when considering that Broadcom is a key Apple supplier. So any outsized AI-upgrade cycle that Apple sees is going to translate into a strong cycle for suppliers like Broadcom as well. Worst Performers EL YTD mountain Estee Lauder YTD Estee Lauder was the worst name of the second quarter for the Club portfolio, losing 30.98%. The stock was largely rangebound in April, however, the negative momentum took hold once again when shares got punished for its light guidance. Management's disappointing outlook sparked fresh concerns over the pace of the recovery in Asia Travel Retail. While the report was largely positive and we did see signs of an inflection playing out, these concerns on the pace and magnitude of the recovery continue to weigh on shares. DIS YTD mountain Disney YTD The second worst performer was Disney , which dropped 18.85% in April through June. Disney started to drift back down after management won its proxy fight to keep activist investor Nelson Peltz off the company board. Peltz, who had a big stake in Disney, exited the position. The stock then took another hit on lackluster earnings , in which the company missed expectations on the top line. While noting that Disney's combined direct-to-consumer (DTC) business is still on the path to profitability by the end of fiscal year 2024 in September, the current quarter would see pressure resulting seasonal weakness attributable to its streaming offering in India, known as Disney+ Hotstar. SWK YTD mountain Stanley Black & Decker YTD The third worst performer of the quarter was Stanley Black & Decker , with an 18.42% decline. While shares recovered post-earnings losses quickly, they subsequently reversed back down and now sit below where the level reached in the selloff after the quarterly numbers were release in early May. At least some of that pressure was likely caused by a rebound in longer-term bond yields, which kept borrowing costs high. We view Stanley Black & Decker as our play on Federal Reserve interest rate cuts, which when they happen, should lower mortgages and boost the housing market. Stanley Black & Decker was one of nine stocks featured in our Fed rate cut stocks commentary. (See here for a full list of the stocks in Jim Cramer's Charitable Trust.)

CNBC,https://www.cnbc.com/2024/06/30/fathom-joint-venture-of-amc-regal-cinemark-makes-major-gains.html,2024-06-30,15:21:20 UTC,"Fathom, the company behind classic films at your local theater, is making major gains in moviegoing","At a time when the box office is starved for content and audiences seem pickier than ever, Fathom Events is posting record revenue gains.

For 20 years, the joint venture between AMC , Regal and Cinemark has been best known for bringing alternative content to the big screen in the form of classic Hollywood titles, live telecasts of theater and opera productions, concerts and even television series.

Most recently, it ventured into the specialty distribution space to deliver ""The Blind,"" ""The Chosen,"" ""Jesus Thirsts: The Miracle of the Eucharist"" and ""Waitress: the Musical"" to audiences. Still to come is ""Andrea Bocelli 30: The Celebration.""

In 2023, Fathom generated $100 million at the box office, a 116% increase over 2019 levels and its highest-grossing year ever. And that momentum has continued into 2024, as the company tallied $43 million in the first quarter, up nearly 140% compared to the $18 million it tallied in the year-earlier period.

Fathom's relationships with Hollywood's biggest studios and its cinematic reach — as the partnership of the industry's three biggest theater chains — has made it a formidable force at the box office. Its value proposition is twofold: It breathes new life into older films, and into theaters.

""Falling mostly under the event film banner, anniversary titles have truly come into vogue seemingly more so now than in years past with a particular emphasis given to these beloved older films,"" said Paul Dergarabedian, senior media analyst at Comscore. ""These anniversary re-releases are a win-win, providing joy to movie fans and notably additional revenues to movie theaters often decades after initial theatrical run.""

In post-pandemic times, Fathom has acted as a crutch for many smaller cinema operators, providing much-needed content for the big screen amid a drought caused by pandemic and strike-related production shutdowns.

Season 4 of ""The Chosen,"" a faith-based television show about the life of Jesus, generated $32 million at the box office for Fathom, around 75% of its first-quarter haul.

""'The Chosen' was through [Fathom], and it was huge for us,"" said Brock Bagby, president and chief content, programming and development officer at B&B Theatres. ""It gave us a lot of extra revenue in February and the beginning of March that we wouldn't have had.""

Fathom has also benefited from its anniversary titles and classic cinema showings. Each year, the company brings films back to theaters to celebrate milestone years alongside fan-favorite titles.

""We've seen that there's a growing segment in the box office, people that are interested in seeing older films on the big screen,"" said Jordan Hohman, vice president of project development at Phoenix Theatres. ""These audiences are getting to enjoy classic films, either for the first time or for the first time, in a new way. I think that that's valuable.""

This year, the company celebrated the 85th anniversaries of ""The Wizard of Oz"" and ""Gone with the Wind"" as well as the 35th anniversary of ""Steel Magnolias."" Still on the calendar is the 50th anniversary of ""Blazing Saddles,"" the 70th anniversary of Alfred Hitchcock's ""Rear Window,"" the 40th anniversary of ""Neverending Story"" and the 20th anniversary of ""Mean Girls.""

It also has a film series called Studio Ghibli Fest, which features 14 films from the studio in their original Japanese and English dubbed versions. This year, the lineup boasts the 20th anniversary of ""Howl's Moving Castle,"" the 35th anniversary of ""Kiki's Delivery Service"" and the 30th anniversary of ""Pom Poko.""

And these titles can generate big box-office hauls even decades after they were first released.

Fathom's three-weekend run of the original Lord of the Rings trilogy resulted in $8.2 million at the box office.

""Lord of the Rings was wildly successful nationwide, and for us,"" Bagby said. ""We just did 4DX Lord of the Rings this weekend in our new Dallas theater, and we sold out every single show.""

4DX is a screen format that utilizes motion seats, practical effects and sensory elements to immerse viewers in a movie experience.

Audiences are already buying tickets for showings in August celebrating the 15th anniversary of ""Coraline,"" which will be shown widely in 3D for the first time since its original release.

Fathom re-released ""Coraline"" twice before with great success. In 2022, the film showed in 800 theaters for one day and tallied $1.2 million in ticket sales. Last year, the film extended its release to five days and snared $7.1 million, making it the highest-grossing classic film release in Fathom history.

That $7.1 million figure is about 10% of the initial domestic run for ""Coraline"" in 2009 and 42% of its opening weekend, according to data from Comscore.

What's more, 53% of the audience who attended screenings of the film last year were 34 years old or younger.

""New audiences are seeing it for the first time although the film is 15 years old,"" said Ray Nutt, CEO of Fathom Events.

Fathom reports presales for this year's screenings of ""Coraline"" are selling seven times as many tickets per location as were sold during the same period last year, with two-thirds of those ticket sales for the 3D version of the film.

Because Fathom has a wide footprint through its parent companies and nationwide marketing, it does the heavy lifting for smaller theater chains.

""[Fathom has] built a lot of relationships,"" Phoenix Theatre's Hohman said. ""They worked out the licensing and they created the marketing behind re-releasing these classic films that, you know, we just can't do ourselves. It's a national campaign. So, I think that they just offer a lot of value.""","At a time when the box office is starved for content and audiences seem pickier than ever, Fathom Events is posting record revenue gains.

CNBC,https://www.cnbc.com/2024/06/29/some-american-plan-to-take-on-debt-for-summer-travel.html,2024-06-29,10:05:01 UTC,36% of Americans plan to take on debt for summer travel. Here's why that worries financial experts,"Some people could find themselves wrangling with summer travel bills well after Labor Day.

To that point, 36% of Americans said they plan to take on debt in order to travel this summer, according to a March survey from Bankrate. The payment methods for summer travel expenses ranged from personal loans (5%) and buy now, pay later services (8%) to borrowing from family and friends (6%).

Additionally, 26% of summer travelers said they intend to use a credit card and pay over for the vacation over multiple billing cycles.

""The reason that's worrisome is because the average credit card charges more than 20%, which is close to a record high,"" said Ted Rossman, a senior credit card industry analyst at Bankrate.

""I don't want to tell people they can't have any fun,"" he said. ""But this represents a lot of people taking on expensive debt, and this is the kind of thing that can linger.""

Millennials (47%) and Gen Zs (42%) are the demographic cohort most likely to say they plan to go into debt to pay for vacation, according to Bankrate.

""There are so many compelling reasons why people choose to take on debt to have these vacations,"" said Sabrina Romanoff, a clinical psychologist.

""If your kids are dreaming of going to Disney World and there's no way the family could ever really swing it without going into debt, it could be a memory the family will have forever,"" she said by way of example.

""And parents often can rationalize spending in these terms for their children, especially when the trip feels like such an important, seminal part of childhood,"" she added.","Some people could find themselves wrangling with summer travel bills well after Labor Day.

One specific detail is cause for immediate rejection, says Stacie Haller, chief career advisor at Resume Builder. ""If I see a picture, that's going in the no pile,"" says Haller, who has over 30 years of staffing and recruiting experience. Including a headshot on your resume invites ageism and snap judgments based on appearance, she says, and indicates ""that person is out of touch with how we do things today."" Recruiters are critical of anything that feels out of date, Haller says, and some details could add bias to the hiring process. Here are other details that should be scrubbed from your resume, according to Haller: An objective: Including an objective on a resume is a waste of space when recruiters are looking at your document for roughly 6 seconds or less, Haller says. The purpose of your resume should be clear — to provide your qualifications for a stated job — so you can save this point for a cover letter.

The purpose of your resume should be clear — to provide your qualifications for a stated job — so you can save this point for a cover letter. A street address: Including your specific home address and ZIP code could lead to discrimination if there are socioeconomic differences by neighborhood, Haller says. Plus, if you don't live where the business is based, a hiring manager could de-prioritize you as a candidate knowing you'd require relocation. Instead, just include your city and state. And if you're open to remote roles, you can note that in your location as well, Haller adds.

And if you're open to remote roles, you can note that in your location as well, Haller adds. An AOL email address: It's been years since the AOL email domain fell out of favor, so using it can make it seem like you're not up to date with technology. Opt for a free Gmail account instead, Haller says.

How to format your resume

Another piece of resume advice: The simpler, the better. Don't add creativity if it comes at the cost of readability, Haller says. Keep your text in one column with clear sections and short bullets, which is better for both human readers and teams that leverage AI readers. Recent grads without professional experience in their field can lead with their education section at the top. Once you have a year or two in the field, put your professional experience section first, listed in reverse-chronological order of your jobs. Then each section should list the bullets of your accomplishments and tasks by what's most relevant to the job you're applying for. Keep a separate skills section to list all the technical skills and certifications you have under your belt — again, it can be worthwhile to order them by what's most critical in the new role you're up for. Stick to a one-page resume if you're early-career in your 20s, Haller says, adding that one to two pages will work for most people throughout their entire careers. Tenured workers with 20-plus years of experience can likely stick to listing their work highlights from the last decade, Haller says. ""Nobody is hiring someone for what they did 20 years ago. It might be part of your story and on there without dates, and for CEOs it could be important,"" but generally, you can edit some of those selections down. C-suite leaders, meanwhile, might stretch their resumes to three or four pages.

Disney and Pixar's ""Inside Out 2"" is the newest member of the billion-dollar club.

The animated feature has tallied $1.014 billion worldwide as of Sunday, making it the highest-grossing film of 2024 and the first film since Warner Bros.′ ""Barbie"" to top $1 billion at the global box office.

""On behalf of movie theatre owners across the country and around the world, we want to congratulate Disney's 'Inside Out 2' for grossing $1 billion faster than any animated movie in history,"" said Michael O'Leary, president and CEO of the National Association of Theatre Owners. ""The film's stunning global success once again illustrates that audiences the world over will respond to compelling, entertaining movies, and that they want to enjoy them on the big screen.""

The billion-dollar benchmark is a much-needed win for Disney's Pixar animation hub. A once prolifically successful studio, Pixar has suffered at the box office in the wake of the pandemic. Much of its difficulties have come, in part, because Disney opted to debut a handful of animated features directly on streaming service Disney+ during theatrical closures and even once cinemas had reopened.

As a result, before ""Inside Out 2,"" no Disney animated feature from Pixar or its Walt Disney Animation studio had generated more than $480 million at the global box office since 2019.

""Inside Out 2"" has also showcased how vital the family audience is to the box office. This underserved crowd accounted for more than 70% of those in attendance during the film's domestic debut, according to data from EntTelligence.

While this audience came out in droves for Universal's ""The Super Mario Bros. Movie,"" which generated more than $1.36 billion at the global box office, there was little for them to feast on until the recent releases of Sony's ""The Garfield Movie"" and Paramount's ""IF.""

""Inside Out 2"" also drove the coveted teen demographic to cinemas, with 14% of foot traffic coming from those aged 13 to 17. This younger generation has been largely absent from the market in recent years.

As the future of moviegoing, this group is particularly important to the industry. Getting them back to the big screen has become a top priority for studios and movie theater operators.

Next up for family and teens is Universal and Illumination's ""Despicable Me 4,"" due out in theaters during the July Fourth holiday weekend.

Farmers can lease their land to solar energy developers, diversifying their income streams while maintaining agricultural activities on the remaining areas. This symbiotic relationship supports sustainable development by reducing greenhouse gas emissions and promoting renewable energy adoption.

Google will partner with BlackRock to develop a 1 gigawatt pipeline of new solar capacity in Taiwan, the U.S. tech giant announced Monday as it seeks to boost energy capacity and cut carbon emissions amid the artificial intelligence boom.

The deal will see Google make a capital investment, yet to be approved by regulators, in Taiwanese solar developer New Green Power ""to facilitate the buildout of its large-scale solar pipeline.""

Google did not reveal how much it was investing into New Green Power, a BlackRock portfolio firm.

The investment will boost clean energy on Taiwan's local electricity grid, and help Google reach its goal of achieving net-zero emissions across all its operations and value chain by 2030, the company said.

The new solar capacity will help power Google's data centers and cloud region in Taiwan, the press release said. Some of the clean energy capacity will also be offered to Google's chip suppliers and manufacturers in the region, it said.

""We expect to procure up to 300 [megawatts] of solar energy from this pipeline through power purchase agreements (PPAs) and the associated energy attribute certificates (Taiwan Renewable Energy Certificates or T-RECS) to help meet electricity demand from our data center campus, cloud region and office operations in Taiwan,"" Amanda Peterson Corio, global head of data center energy at Google, said in a blog post Monday.

Taiwan produces nearly 60% of the world's semiconductor chips and accounts for an even bigger share of advanced AI processors, according to global consulting firm EY. Chip fabrication facilities are among the most energy-intensive facilities in the world as chip manufacturing is a long and complex process.","The aerial view reveals the mutual benefits of combining solar energy production and agricultural land use.

Shares of Facebook parent Meta are down more than 30% this year amid a troubling macro environment and weaker-than-expected results. Igor Golovniov | SOPA Images | LightRocket | Getty Images

Facebook parent company Meta was on Monday accused by EU regulators of failing to comply with the bloc's landmark antitrust rules over its recently introduced ad-supported social networking service. The Commission labelled the ad-supported subscription option a ""pay or consent"" model — which means users have to either pay to use Meta's platforms ad-free, or consent to their data being processed for personalized advertising. The service was introduced for Facebook and Instagram in Europe last year. ""In the Commission's preliminary view, this binary choice forces users to consent to the combination of their personal data and fails to provide them a less personalised but equivalent version of Meta's social networks,"" regulators said in a statement Monday. A Meta spokesperson told CNBC in a statement that its ad-supported subscription model ""follows the direction of the highest court in Europe and complies with the DMA."" ""We look forward to further constructive dialogue with the European Commission to bring this investigation to a close,"" the spokesperson added.

Meta introduced the new model in response to a ruling from the European Court of Justice, the EU's top court, last year that a company may offer an ""alternative"" version of its service that does not rely on data collection for ads. Meta has previously pointed to this ruling as a reason for introducing the subscription offer. In its statement Monday, the Commission said that Meta's ad-supported offering failed to comply with the DMA for two key reasons: one is that it doesn't let users opt for a service that uses less personal data but is still equivalent to the ""personalized ads""-based service. Regulators said users should still be entitled to ""get access to an equivalent service which uses less of their personal data, in this case for the personalization of advertising."" The other reason cited by the EU is that the Meta ad-supported service doesn't allow users to exercise their right to ""freely consent"" for their personal data to be used to target them with online ads.

The largest utility companies in the U.S. are warning that the nation is facing a surge of electricity demand unlike anything seen in decades, and failure to rapidly increase power generation could jeopardize the nation's economy. After a more than decade-long period of largely flat growth, electricity demand is poised to skyrocket by 2030 as the artificial intelligence revolution, the expansion of chip manufacturing, and the electrification of the vehicle fleet all coincide as the U.S. is trying to address climate change. The tech sector's build out of data centers to support AI and the adoption of electric vehicles alone is expected to add 290 terawatt hours of electricity demand by the end of the decade, according to a report released by the consulting firm Rystad Energy this week. The expected demand from data centers and electric vehicles in the U.S. is equivalent to the entire electricity demand of Turkey, the world's 18th largest economy, according to Rystad. ""This growth is a race against time to expand power generation without overwhelming electricity systems to the point of stress,"" said Surya Hendry, a Rystad analyst, in a release following the report's publication.

'The stakes are really, really high'

The major tech players – Amazon , Alphabet's Google unit, Microsoft and Meta – are urgently requesting more power as they bring data centers online that in some cases require a gigawatt of electricity, said Petter Skantze, vice president of infrastructure development at NextEra Energy Resources. To put that in context, a gigawatt is equivalent to the capacity of nuclear reactor. NextEra Energy , parent of Skantze's subsidiary, is the largest power company in the S&P utilities sector by market capitalization and it operates the biggest portfolio of renewable energy assets in the nation. ""This is a different urgency coming. They need this load to drive the next iteration of growth,"" Skantze told the Reuters Global Energy Transition conference in New York City this week. ""They're showing up now at the utility and they're banging on the door and they're saying I need to put this resource on the grid,"" the executive said.

A big challenge will be whether enough resources are available to connect those large data center projects to the power grid, Skantze said. The stakes are high for the U.S. economy, the executive said. ""If I can't get that power capacity online, I cannot do the data center. I cannot do the manufacturing. I can't grow the core businesses of some of the largest corporations in the country,"" Skantze said. ""The stakes are really, really high. This is a new environment. We have to get this right."" NextEra CEO John Ketchum told investors earlier this month that U.S. power demand will increase by 38% over the next two decades, a fourfold increase over the annual rate of growth in the previous 20 years. NextEra expects much of the demand to be met by renewables and battery storage, Ketchum said. The company has a 300-gigawatt pipeline of renewable and storage projects.

'Energy security brings national security'

Southern Company , the second-largest utility in the U.S. by market cap, is also seeing a historic wave of electricity demand. The power company is headquartered in Atlanta, one of the fastest growing data center markets in the U.S. with 723 gigawatts under construction in 2023, up 211% over the prior year, according to real estate services firm CBRE. Southern Company CEO Chris Womack said the company is seeing a level of demand not seen since the advent of air conditioning and heat pumps in the South in the 1970s and 1980s. The utility is expecting demand to grow by three or four times, he said. ""A lot of this is dependent and contingent upon what we see with artificial intelligence and all those large learning models and what data centers will consume,"" Womack said. ""You're also seeing in the Southeast, this incredible population growth and you're seeing all this onshoring with manufacturing."" Supplying the demand with reliable power is a matter of economic and national security, Womack said. Southern expects 80% of the demand through the end of the decade to be met by renewables, he said.","The expected demand from data centers and electric vehicles in the U.S. is equivalent to the entire electricity demand of Turkey, the world's 18th largest economy, according to Rystad.

CNBC,https://www.cnbc.com/2024/06/28/amazon-doubling-value-of-credits-for-startups-to-build-on-aws-cloud.html,2024-06-30,00:56:26 UTC,Amazon is doubling value of credits for some startups to build on AWS as Microsoft cloud gains ground,"Attendees walk through an expo hall at AWS re:Invent, a conference hosted by Amazon Web Services, at the Venetian in Las Vegas on Nov. 28, 2023.

Amazon will double the value of credits it offers some startups to use its cloud infrastructure, CNBC has learned, as the company faces heightened competition from Microsoft in artificial intelligence services.

Starting July 1, startups that have raised a Series A round of funding in the past year will be eligible for $200,000 in credits through AWS' Activate program, up from $100,000 before, the Amazon cloud unit said in an email to venture capitalists this week. Seed-stage startups will still be eligible for $100,000 in credits, AWS said.

Two people briefed on the changes confirmed the credit increase, though they asked not to be named because the information is private.

Matt Garman, who was recently promoted to CEO of AWS after running sales and marketing, was meeting with founders in Silicon Valley this week, the people said. Garman told the execs that collaborating with startups would always be a primary focus, one of the people said, adding that Garman described AI companies as AWS' ideal customers.

AWS confirmed the increase in credits and Garman's visit to Silicon Valley, and said that in the past, the $100,000 would expire in one year, while the $200,000 credit will now expire in three years. A company spokesperson called AWS the leader in cloud ""by a wide margin,"" adding that over 280,000 startups run on AWS, including 96% of ""unicorns"" in AI and machine learning.

""These new programs are simply us doubling down on this incredible momentum,"" the spokesperson said.

Amazon, which is best known for its massive online retail operation, derives most of its profit from AWS, a business it launched in 2006, well before rivals Microsoft and Google hit the scene. AWS leads the market, with $25 billion in revenue in the first quarter, up 17% from a year earlier.

But Microsoft Azure and Google Cloud are growing more quickly, and are benefiting from rapidly advancing AI models. Backed by Microsoft, OpenAI launched ChatGPT in late 2022 on Azure, and has since attracted a wave of AI workloads to Microsoft from companies big and small. Google has a number of large language models, most notably Gemini.

Amazon has been trying to catch up in generative AI and has poured billions of dollars into OpenAI challenger Anthropic.

Last month, AWS CEO Adam Selipsky announced his resignation after three years running the business, with Garman named as his successor. During Selipsky's time at the helm, Microsoft and Google increased their share of the cloud infrastructure market. One analyst told CNBC that Microsoft ""ran laps around"" AWS in generative AI.

Startups have long been fertile ground for cloud infrastructure companies, as they try and lure ambitious founders who could be building the next multibillion-dollar business.

In November, Microsoft announced a partnership with Silicon Valley accelerator Y Combinator that would provide participating startups with $350,000 in Azure credits and access to graphics processing units (GPUs) for training AI models, a spokesperson said. Microsoft has since extended the $350,000 credit incentive to other accelerators, including the AI Grant.

Startups enrolled in Microsoft's Founders Hub program, which doesn't require previous venture funding, can receive up to $150,000 in Azure credits over four years.

In addition to its Activate offering, Amazon has a new 10-week generative AI accelerator program. Participants will be able to access up to $1 million in cloud credits, according to the website.

Earlier on Friday, Amazon's head scientist, Rohit Prasad, told employees that the company has hired David Luan, co-founder and CEO of AI startup Adept, along with some of Luan's colleagues. ""Amazon is also licensing Adept's agent technology, family of state-of-the-art multimodal models, and a few datasets,"" Adept said in a blog post.

AWS remains the leader in cloud infrastructure, but Microsoft is quickly closing the gap. AWS' market share slipped to 31% in the first quarter of this year from 32% three years earlier, while Azure jumped to 25% of the market from 19% in 2021, according to Canalys. Google is also picking up share, accounting for 10% of the market, up from 7% in early 2021.

CNBC,https://www.cnbc.com/2024/06/30/move-over-remote-ceos-say-borderless-talent-future-tech-jobs.html,2024-06-30,15:41:36 UTC,"Move over, remote jobs. CEOs say borderless talent is the future of tech work","To work remotely or not is no longer the question. Experts say it's borderless hiring for technology roles that is stealing the conversation.

""Remote is like the gateway drug to borderless,"" said Jeremy Johnson, CEO of AI-enabled tech talent marketplace Andela, whose customers include Goldman Sachs, Github and Coursera. ""Once you realize that you don't have to all be in the same office five days a week in order to build a compelling culture and feel connected to the mission and solve complex problems, you then start thinking there are great people all over the world.""

With tech leaders focusing concurrently on innovation and value-driven efficiency, tech hiring that eclipses national or even global time zone delineation is a growing phenomenon. Borderless tech hiring has doubled in the last three years, according to Gartner's 2023 CEO Survey. By 2022, the tech talent workforce in cities like Beijing and Delhi far outweighed that of U.S. powerhouses like San Francisco and New York, reports CBRE Global Tech Talent Guidebook 2024. The report cites burgeoning tech talent markets like Bucharest, Romania; Cape Town, South Africa; Cebu City, Philippines; Nairobi, Kenya and more.

Global hiring is an example of a luxury that's moving down the value chain, Johnson said. Much like services such as Uber increased access to what is essentially a private driver on demand, talent marketplaces and a digitized workforce make global hiring more than just a pricey C-suite search.

Global payment processing platform Payoneer has its hands in the borderless hiring world from an internal perspective (with about 2,200 employees in 50 countries and more than 25 offices globally), but it also benefits from and drives the borderless trend with its clients.

""The rhetoric about the globalized opportunity is powerful, but it doesn't make any difference to the business you're doing unless you actually have the utilities and tools to do it,"" said Payoneer CEO John Caplan.

Pockets of talent worldwide

Adam Jackson, CEO of decentralized tech talent platform Braintrust, does borderless differently. ""We don't have a physical office,"" he said. ""Everyone works remotely. Every engineer but one who works on Braintrust is outside of the U.S."" Braintrust's clients, from NASA to Nestlé, are building borderless teams, too, Jackson says.

""It was the case maybe 20 years ago when I moved to San Francisco that the best tech, best developers, best product managers and designers all lived here in Silicon Valley,"" Jackson added. ""That's just not true anymore. There are still many here, but there are pockets all over the world.""

Some leaders, like Johnson, believe time zone coordination is still important to provide certain employees with the opportunity to work synchronously. Jackson, however, has the viewpoint that global innovation with an asynchronous workforce is a chance to create a company ""where the sun never sets.""

While there are questions about work-life balance, Jackson says that doesn't exist in startup culture anyway, but that asynchronous work can increase clarity in documentation and minimize the endless treadmill of meetings, leaving more time for creative thinking and deep work.

Johnson says local labor laws, compliance and payroll are all factors at play in global operations, which is why many organizations have opened centers in specific countries. But even these obstacles aren't insurmountable.

AI and future of work geographies

One thing these experts agree on is that there's no one-size-fits-all approach to borderless hiring. ""Every company has to find their own bespoke solution,"" Caplan said. ""You have to design your office footprint, your future-of-work philosophy to the business you're building.""

Thinking about artificial intelligence innovation and, on the flip side of the same coin, AI regulation, Johnson says the European Union's standard-setting regulatory framework will make it tough for tech operations to thrive. As more regulatory and case law settles around the globe surrounding AI and data, cross-border employment trends will shift like puzzle pieces.

""I think Europe is going to have a really tough time over the next few years,"" he said. ""They're pushing a lot of data innovation out of the continent, and I think that's an opportunity for Africa and Latin America and other parts of the world.""

Regardless of where organizations hire, Jackson emphasizes the importance of managing risk and hiring good people. ""Quality still matters,"" he said. ""The old adage is when you're building software, do you want to be fast, good quality, or cheap? Pick two. Now, I reject that. You can have all three, but quality still matters, no matter where you are.""

Caplan relishes in the more altruistic potential of borderless employment, namely its ability to ""lift up communities around the globe."" This may be true, but at the very least, its benefits for expanded talent reach and cost effectiveness are enough for leaders in all kinds of industries to take it on. With applications for standard work-sponsored visas in the U.S. up 263% in 2023 compared to the year prior, according to Deel's latest Tech Migration Report, and U.S. cities accounting for the top five average monthly apartment rent costs, borderless hiring could ease the burden for employment seekers and employment providers in one

""If you could make your single biggest expense, which is talent, 10% more efficient, you have a dramatic advantage,"" Johnson said. Borderless hiring, it seems, will continue to infiltrate the growth playbook at all levels.","Borderless tech hiring has doubled in the last three years, according to Gartner's 2023 CEO Survey.

""Where past generations visited department stores or shopping malls to buy basics or check out new styles, Gen Z are looking for trends online, following idols and influencers and aspiring to wear the same clothing,"" the report said.

The report surveyed 7,000 consumers across 14 markets including China, Singapore, Indonesia, Vietnam and the Philippines. Nearly half of the respondents in each market were in the Gen Z age group – defined as 18 to 24 years old in the survey.

Gen Z ranked social commerce (63%) and livestreaming commerce (57%) as important to their shopping experience, the survey revealed. Social commerce was the most popular form of retail tech among Gen Z – especially in China, Vietnam, Indonesia and the Philippines.

Gen Z is known as the first generation to grow up with the internet and digital devices as a part of daily life.

Nearly two in three workers around the world are ""vacation deprived,"" according to a new report published by Expedia. However, the report shows the feeling is highest among cultures that take the most days off. Some 84% of Germans and 69% of French respondents said they feel they don't have enough time off, according to Expedia's ""Vacation Deprivation Report"" published on June 20. That's despite respondents from both countries taking the most vacation days — 27 days and 29 days, respectively — in the survey. The survey of more than 11,500 workers showed Americans take the least time off per year (11 days), followed by Japan (12 days). However, only 53% of Japanese said they feel ""vacation deprived"" compared to 65% of Americans, it showed.

The survey — Expedia's 24th annual report on the topic — shows that while vacation deprivation rates have decreased in many parts of the world, the feeling is at an 11-year high in the United States.

What's happening in France and Germany?

Expedia's report indicates that feeling ""vacation deprived"" has less to do with the actual time off one takes, and more to do with cultural mores around work and free time. ""The French overwhelmingly view time off as a basic, fundamental right, while Americans seem to treat is as a guilty pleasure,"" said Christie Hudson, head of public relations for Expedia in the United States. ""This is why not even a month seems like enough time to the average French worker.""

Among Germans, however, only 42% said they feel their employers are supportive of them taking their vacation time, the lowest rate across all markets, said Hudson. ""This can contribute to guilt and being unable to unplug and feel refreshed after vacation,"" she said, adding that ""vacation deprivation"" can result from feeling unable to use the days off you are given, she said.

Wasted vacation days

Despite most workers indicating they feel vacation deprived, respondents from nearly every location admitted to letting some of their annual leave lapse.

Hong Kongers, however, meticulously planned their leave, not allowing a single day to go unused, on average, the report showed. Interestingly, Hong Kong was the only location where workers said they planned to take more time off than they're given, said Hudson. ""In 2024, 15% of Hong Kongers plan on taking 31 vacation days, exceeding the average allotted 25.5 days,"" said Hudson. ""It's an interesting finding and could be linked to the fact that they seem to have a strong pro-PTO culture: 80% of Hong Kong workers agree that their employers are supportive of employees taking their vacation time, which is one of the highest rates globally."" That could mean that ""those few extra days here and there are overlooked,"" she said. Singaporeans, too, carefully plan their time off, allowing only one of their 20 days of annual leave to lapse, according to the report. But those in Japan aren't nearly as focused on maximizing their days off, it showed. Respondents there left seven out of 19 days on the table, on average.

Bloomberg | Bloomberg | Getty Images

Optimism in artificial intelligence drove up Taiwan's stock market in the first of the 2024, making it the top performing market in Asia-Pacific so far this year. The Taiwan Weighted Index has surged 28% so far this year, powered by stocks along the AI value chain. Heavyweight Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Corp climbed 63% in the first half of the year, while its rival Foxconn — traded as Hon Hai Precision Industry — jumped 105% in the same period. ""The performance of global markets this year has been largely driven by the themes of Artificial Intelligence and central bank policy, and that is likely to continue,"" said Rahul Ghosh, global equity portfolio specialist at asset management company T. Rowe Price said in the firm's investment outlook. The potential and scale of the AI investment cycle continues to drive economic activity globally, he said, adding that the impact of AI investments are broadening out to sectors such as industrials, materials and utilities.

Japan's benchmark index Nikkei 225 ranked second in the region, after repeatedly surpassing all-time highs earlier this year. In the first six months of the year, the Nikkei has gained about 18%. The Nikkei smashed past a 34-year record in February, breaching its previous all-time high of 38,915.87, set on Dec. 29, 1989. Following that, the index surged past the psychological threshold of 40,000, and eventually reached a new all-time closing high of 40,888.43 on March 22. While Taiwan may lead Asian markets, Japan seems to be the favored market going forward, among analysts who spoke to CNBC.

Ghosh said that improved corporate governance standards continue to have a tangible — and considerable — impact on company performance in the world's fourth largest economy. Furthermore, a June 14 note from Ben Powell, chief APAC investment strategist at the BlackRock Investment Institute, pointed out that the Bank of Japan has increasing confidence it will meet its inflation targets, and as such, normalize its monetary policy ""in a gradual and measured way."" Powell said Japan's macroeconomic backdrop is favorable for risk assets. ""We remain overweight Japanese equities, driven by strong corporate reform momentum, healthy earnings and the valuation support from still-negative real interest rates."" While most Asian markets are in positive territory year-to-date, three stock markets — Thailand, Indonesia and the Philippines — fell into negative territory. Thailand's SET Index plunged 8% in the first six months, to be the worst performing index in the region. The Jakarta Composite was down by 2.88% while the Philippine stock exchange index slipped about 0.6% in the same period.

All eyes on the Fed

Most central banks in Asia are keeping a close eye on the Federal Reserve's next move, as they typically make monetary policy decisions based on the U.S. central bank's anticipated moves. The Fed signaled toward the end of 2023 that several rate cuts were on the cards this year. However, the most recent ""dot plot"" from the Fed's May meeting projected only one cut of 25 basis points for the remainder of 2024.This was a huge departure from the graph released at the end of March, where the Fed implied that rates will be cut by 75 basis points in 2024. The dot plot is a visual representation of each FOMC member's interest rate projection for the bank's short-term interest rate at specific points in the future. The central bank, however, has penciled in a more aggressive path to tightening monetary policy in 2025, increasing its forecast to four cuts of 25 basis points each.

watch now

Rate cut expectations have been pushed back repeatedly as inflation remained stickier than expected. Higher employment and wage growth in the U.S. also added to the narrative that there was no need for the Fed to lower rates. The question now is: When will the first rate cut happen? The CME FedWatch tool indicates that 61% of traders expect the Fed to cut rates by 25 basis points in the September meeting. But on June 16, Minneapolis Federal Reserve President Neel Kashkari said it's a ""reasonable prediction"" that the U.S. central bank will cut interest rates once this year, but will wait until December to do it. Kashkari's view was echoed by Ken Orchard, head of international fixed income at asset management firm T. Rowe Price. ""We still see the Fed cutting 25 basis points at its December policy meeting, after the November elections are out of the way, and possibly once in the summer.""

Air traffic, extreme weather The Federal Aviation Administration has found a shortage of up to 3,000 needed air traffic controllers. Last summer, a record-breaking summer for airports, there were air traffic jams and near collisions amid challenges in flight coordination. Based on air traffic patterns and airport density, New York City and Florida are subject to the highest risk of backups. The massive heat wave across the U.S. was a peek at the kind of extreme weather that can lead to travel issues. The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration expects disruptive weather for the holiday week, with storms across the Midwest and East Coast, and continuing dangerous heat in the Southwest and interior Northeast. Extreme temperatures cause technical failures that result in delays. High heat creates thin air, which hampers the plane's thrust for takeoff and ascent. That means airplanes need more runway for takeoff or a lighter aircraft — by removing baggage or passengers. And it means that very high temperatures increase the risk of flight cancellations. The best bet to avoid this risk is to take early morning and late-night flights. Good news to reduce travel anxiety If travelers prepare and secure backup plans, they can make the best out of the busy summer season. And despite travel anxiety and a cascade of uncertain factors, travel expert and managing editor at The Points Guy, Clint Henderson, says airlines and airports are so far showing signs of being better prepared than past years. Despite May issues and despite some airlines pulling back on overall hiring plans compared to past years, in part due to Boeing delays, Henderson said, ""We have not seen the major meltdowns that we saw a couple of years ago. And I think part of the reason for that is the airlines and the airports, and everyone from Uber to rental car companies, you know, you name it, everyone staffed back up.""

United Airlines has projected a 7% increase in flyers from the 2023 Independence Day week, and is adapting with new staff. American Airlines is slated for 10% more summer departures year over year. Improvements in coordination for air traffic controllers are also taking place. ""The federal government and local ATC towers have been working together better, and that includes the military. They've opened up military airspace to help accommodate the crowd, so we have seen snarls,"" Henderson said. ""There is still a shortage of air traffic controllers, but it hasn't led to the worst outcomes that we were expecting when we were talking about the shortage of air traffic control workers even a year ago."" That said, he warns that in severe weather, a shortage of air traffic control may still worsen delays for travelers. Tips for Independence Day travel With lower-than-expected prices, many more flyers this summer are infrequent flyers, who should start by signing up for airline apps which may offer them some introductory benefits, starting with miles and extending to free WiFi on some flights. Henderson said the easiest ways to save hours of wait times include signing up for programs that offer passengers faster movement through security, including TSA PreCheck and Clear, as well as the no-application-required Mobile Passport Control app, which allows users to go through an expedited U.S. Customs lane. He also recommended the ""Flighty"" tracker app, or similar flight tracker, to stay on top of options in the event flight status changes. Flyers need to also stay on top of the routes that the planes they plan to take are already traveling on, to catch issues at other airports which could ultimately cause a cascade of cancellations. ""If your flight gets canceled, you're competing with all those people on that plane to get on the next available flight. So if you have a head start on those people, you're going to be the winner,"" Henderson said. When it comes to traveling during peak season, ""Information is power,"" he said. Cheaper airfares may not be here to stay Airfares are down, but many factors influence price, from the specific destination of a traveler, with wide variation in prices depending on route, to how far in advance tickets are purchased, midweek travel versus weekend dates, and what additional fees (e.g. baggage) may push up the total cost of travel significantly. In addition, with issues lingering in the supply of new planes, from Boeing production being curtailed by the FAA to Airbus running into supply chain snafus, the recent dip in fares may not last too long. Henderson eventually expects price hikes from airlines related to increasing maintenance costs and reduced fleet capacity. Labor costs and fuel costs per flight skyrocketed in the past year. With production delays, airlines pay billions to fly less fuel-efficient and more costly and aged jets. Technical issues are more common on older plans and increase delays as well. On June 26, Southwest Airlines cut its second-quarter revenue forecast while citing booking concerns. The firm announced a decline in expected revenue per seat per mile, and fuel costs increasing up to 7.5% year over year. But for now, even with rising costs, flight prices have yet to return to their summer 2023 peaks, and consumers are taking advantage. Henderson said many last-minute travel deals that airlines are offering this summer are still available. Even if the security lines are long, prices on many routes should not weigh travelers down. Hopefully, neither will delays and cancellations.","Last summer, a record-breaking summer for airports, there were air traffic jams and near collisions amid challenges in flight coordination.

French stocks staged a relief rally early Monday after results from the first round of the nation's snap election raised expectations of a hung parliament. The far-right National Rally party and its allies won 33.1% of the vote, the left-wing NFP alliance was second with 28% and Macron's coalition secured 20%, France's Interior Ministry said Monday. France's benchmark CAC 40 index was 1.3% higher by 10:17 a.m. London time, off earlier highs of more than 2.5%. ""The election, in the end, tells us pretty much what we knew before, which is that the most likely scenario remains a hung parliament,"" Sebastian Paris Horvitz, director of research at La Banque Postale Asset Management, told CNBC's ""Squawk Box Europe."" From a market perspective that is the ""least bad"" option, he added, although it's far from ideal. ""Generally you have a majority to govern France ... After the second round, maybe we are not going to have such a majority. And so we have to figure out how France will be governed.""

It comes after economists at Citi and elsewhere warned that an outright victory for either the far-right or leftist alliance could cause a severe market shock given their tax and spending plans, with the potential to spiral into a debt crisis. ""A hung parliament appears likely and would, we believe, be seen as a positive development for European assets, as markets would price in policies on tax and immigration that would more closely resemble the status quo,"" Matthew Ryan, head of market strategy at financial services firm Ebury, said in a note Monday. ""Following their strong showing in the first round, the possibility of a majority for National Rally remains in play, however, which could act to cap gains in the euro in the coming days.""

Stock Chart Icon Stock chart icon Euro/U.S. dollar.

The second round of the vote is due on July 7 and to win a majority, the National Rally would need to secure 289 out of 577 seats in the National Assembly, France's lower house of parliament. Current candidates now have until Tuesday evening to confirm whether they will be proceeding to the final round. Some left-wing and centrist candidates who placed third in their local race are expected to drop out to avoiding splitting the vote, in an effort to curb far-right gains. This has added to uncertainty over the final result.

A key question remains who will be prime minister — a position currently held by Gabriel Attal, an ally of President Emmanuel Macron. National Rally is hoping it will be the party's 28-year-old leader, Jordan Bardella. With Macron previously stating he plans to carry out the remainder of his term as president until 2027, this would lead to a ""cohabitation"" scenario in which the two roles are at odds. Even in a hung parliament — where no party has an overall majority, making it difficult to pass bills and implement a broad agenda — the French Constitution allows for the continuation of the current budget, so areas such as pension payments are not destabilized, Horvitz said.

""Still, there is no reform,"" he continued, noting this comes as a critical time for Europe as it deals with defense threats, the energy transition and weak French and German economic growth. Horvitz added that French borrowing costs, which have soared versus Germany's since the election was called, are likely to remain elevated. That will likely lead to continued pressure on assets linked to bonds, including bank stocks and some utilities, he said.

But the one thing they all have in common is that they're irrational, according to one phobia specialist.

""A phobia is an irrational response to a benign substance,"" Christopher Paul Jones, a London-based phobia specialist with a clinic on London's Harley Street, told CNBC Make It in an interview.

""As human beings, we are primitively hardwired that when we experience danger, our amygdala fires off, and then we do one of several things. Most commonly fight, flight, or freeze. So, either get angry and punch the thing, or we run from the thing, or we hide from the thing,"" he said. The amygdala is a part of the brain that processes emotions like fear or motivation.

This trigger is handy when we were fighting saber-toothed tigers or if we were in actual danger, Jones said. However, a phobia is when that response is to something that isn't dangerous.

Jones' clinic has treated a variety of phobias from a fear of water, heights, germs, needles, and even the fear of failure.

He explained that phobias develop through a conditioned response like that of Pavlov's dogs experiment. That famous experiment was carried out by Russian neurologist Ivan Pavlov who would ring a bell every time he fed his dogs. The dogs eventually started to salivate when they heard the bell ring because they associated it with food.

""Human beings do the same thing,"" Jones explained. ""Most commonly with a phobia, at some point in your past, your brain has linked danger to something that has happened ... then whenever you think about that thing again in the future, it fires off that old response.""

Jones' recently published book ""Face Your Fears"" guides readers through exercises to help them overcome their fears. He shared his three top tips to overcome any fear with CNBC Make It.","Phobias come in many forms: Some people fear spiders while others fear flying on a plane.

For the third year in a row, Vienna, the capital of Austria, is the world's most livable city, according to the Economist Intelligence Unit.

The annual report, which aims to show how comfortable or livable a city is, examined 173 cities globally based on 30 indicators organized into five categories: stability, health care, culture and environment, education and infrastructure.

Boosted by its perfect scores for stability, health care, education and infrastructure, Vienna led this year's list, followed closely by its Western European counterparts: Copenhagen, Denmark, in second place and Zurich, Switzerland, in third.

Vienna's overall score took a minor hit in the culture and environment categories, ""owing to a lack of major sporting events,"" according to the EIU Global Liveability Index for 2024.

""EIU's Liveability Index has risen fractionally over the past year,"" the report said. ""Declines in stability and infrastructure across a number of cities in advanced economies were offset by structural improvements in healthcare and education in several cities in developing markets.""

Here are the 10 most livable cities in the world, according to EIU.

Vienna, Austria Copenhagen, Denmark Zurich, Switzerland Melbourne, Australia Calgary, Canada Geneva, Switzerland Sydney, Australia Vancouver, Canada Osaka, Japan Auckland, New Zealand

Four Asia-Pacific cities made it to this year's top 10: Australian cities Melbourne and Sydney, as well as Osaka, Japan, and Auckland, New Zealand.

Melbourne, Sydney and Vancouver made the top 10 this year, but slipped ""amid a significant shortfall in housing availability,"" the EIU said. For the same reason, Toronto fell to 12th place this year, after ranking among the top 10 in the previous two years.

Western Europe was the best-performing region for livability globally, scoring an overall 92 out of 100. However, it has dropped since last year due to an increase in protests and crime, which weighed on the stability category, according to the report.

North America was the second best region, scoring an average of 90.5 out of 100, and ranking highest for education. The ongoing housing crisis in Canada has dragged down the region's infrastructure scores, EIU said.","Vienna, Austria is the wrold's most ""liveable"" city, according to the Economist Intelligence Unit's 2024 Global Liveability Index.

CNBC,https://www.cnbc.com/2024/06/29/obama-clinton-excuse-biden-trump-debate.html,2024-06-29,14:36:53 UTC,"Obama, Clinton excuse Biden's debate performance to fend off Democratic meltdown: 'Bad debate nights happen'","Former US President Barack Obama (L) and former US President Bill Clinton (R) cheer for US President Joe Biden during a campaign fundraising event at Radio City Music Hall in New York City on March 28, 2024.

Former Presidents Barack Obama and Bill Clinton on Friday tried to do some damage control following President Joe Biden's debate fumble against his November election opponent, former President Donald Trump.

""Bad debate nights happen. Trust me, I know. But this election is still a choice between someone who has fought for ordinary folks his entire life and someone who only cares about himself,"" Obama said in a post on X, linking to Biden's campaign website. ""Last night didn't change that, and it's why so much is at stake in November.""

Several hours later, Clinton mimicked the defensive play.

""I'll leave the debate rating to the pundits, but here's what I know: facts and history matter,"" Clinton said in his own post on X, following with a brief list of Biden's accomplishments.

Throughout the 90-minute showdown on Thursday, Biden regularly stumbled, taking mid-sentence pauses to gather his words and tripping over his sentences. The blunders happened even on topics like abortion and the economy, which he tends to be cogent on during campaign rallies and White House events.

The messaging from Obama and Clinton marks a shift in strategy for Democrats as they try to course-correct after Thursday's flop.

Much of Democrats' spin immediately following the debate attempted to play down Biden's conspicuous blunders, instead attacking Trump's performance and giving Biden a generous evaluation.

""As the night went on, I think [Biden] really kind of rose to the occasion,"" Biden co-campaign chair Mitch Landrieu told NBC News Thursday night after the debate. ""I'm proud of the fact that he stood up to Donald Trump.""

The comments from Obama and Clinton represent a new tact: Acknowledge the debate disaster and then tell the public not to focus on it.

Biden himself followed that framing on Friday during a rally in North Carolina: ""Folks, I don't walk as easily as I used to. I don't speak as smoothly as I used to. I don't debate as well as I used to. But I know what I do know: I know how to tell the truth.""

But debates do matter to voters. After the September 2020 debate, a slew of polls found that voters thought Biden did a better job, which helped him maintain his lead against Trump.

This year's presidential race has been a near dead-heat so far and will likely be won by tight margins come November, leaving little room for error.

In the days since the debate, Democrats have been concerned about how it might weigh on voter perceptions, which are already rife with worries about Biden's age and fitness to lead the country for another four years.

Some Democratic strategists, donors and pundits have already suggested that Biden should drop out of the race and reopen the Democratic field to potentially stronger candidates.

The Biden campaign has so far rejected that proposal. Biden and Trump are scheduled to face off at a second and final debate on Sept. 10.","Former Presidents Barack Obama and Bill Clinton on Friday tried to do some damage control following President Joe Biden's debate fumble against his November election opponent, former President Donald Trump.

China has stepped up its aggression against the Philippines in the contested waters of the South China Sea, calling into question the strength of American deterrence, according to policy analysts. Last week, the Chinese coast guard seized two Filipino ships on a resupply mission to an outpost on the Second Thomas Shoal in the Spratly Islands, severely injuring a navy personnel, according to Philippine officials. The shoal is claimed by both Manila and Beijing. The area has seen several clashes over the past months. Experts say the latest incident represents an escalation and shows the limitations of the U.S.-Philippines Mutual Defense Treaty signed in 1951. ""The failure of the MDT to deter the [latest confrontation] shows the vagueness in the conveyed commitments of the two parties,"" said Chester Cabalza, president and founder of the Philippines-based think tank International Development and Security Cooperation.

Last year, the Philippines and U.S. released new ""Bilateral Defense Guidelines,"" reaffirming that an ""armed attack"" in the South China Sea on Filipino vessels would invoke mutual defense obligations of the U.S. China, on its part, has been careful not to trigger the MDT by avoiding the use of guns, instead employing ""gray zone"" tactics — coercive actions that fall short of an armed conflict — at the Second Thomas Shoal. These reportedly have included the use of water cannons and ramming into Philippine boats.

U.S. 'gray zone' conundrum

Beijing's actions aim to stop resupply missions to a rusted Philippine vessel grounded on the shoal since 1999, as its existence there appears to lend credence to the Philippines' claim on the reef. According to Cabalza, unless Manila and Washington do more to increase deterrence, Beijing will continue to employ ""gray zone"" tactics in its attempt to win the shoal and other areas contested by the Philippines. ""The usage of these tactics should be classified as an armed attack [in the MDT] if the U.S. is serious about helping the Philippines in its strategic and asymmetrical warfare with China,"" he said.

An expanded definition of an ""armed attack"" in the treaty could include ""any willful act to inflict injury or that leads to fatality on Filipinos,"" said Richard Heydarian, policy adviser and senior lecturer of international affairs at the University of the Philippines. Those guidelines are consistent with the interpretation of the MDT in a report by the U.S. Indo-Pacific Command that was unclassified last year. However, according to Heydarian, a muted Philippine reaction to last week's clash could be a sign of its apprehensions with regard to invoking the mutual defense treaty.

""The Philippine Government is confronted with a huge dilemma. It wants greater reassurance from the United States, but it's likely not getting that, and it also wants to avoid unwanted escalation,"" said Heydarian. ""It's extremely important for the Philippines and U.S. to signal that Filipino troops are empowered and sanctioned to use live firearms to defend themselves, and that usage of live firearms by China would immediately trigger the MDT,"" he added. However, according to Abdul Rahman Yaacob, a research fellow at the Lowy Institute's Southeast Asia Program, the U.S. is unlikely to widen the scope of the defense pact, as doing so could draw them into a wider military conflict.

Amid a ""sober assessment on the risk of U.S. non-involvement,"" the Philippines will also look to step up its own deterrence and strategy in asserting its territorial claims, according to Matteo Piasentini, China and Indo-Pacific analyst at Geopolitica, an Italian think tank. Philippine President Ferdinand Marcos Jr. said on Thursday that while the latest incident at the shoal was not an ""armed attack,"" the country needs to ""do more"" than protest China's actions.

""The Philippines will continue to resupply the Sierra Madre, and hopefully invest in more outposts in their Exclusive Economic Zone in the South China Sea ... There is no illusion that China will give up; what Manila is trying to do is not to give up on its own,"" Paisentini said. The Philippines defense chief has reiterated that the military would not announce its resupply missions to the shoal in advance. According to the Lowy Institute's Yaacob, this could help it outmaneuver Beijing while avoiding direct confrontations. The country has also been working to bolster its own defense capabilities in the South China Sea with the support of the U.S.

What's at stake?

The Second Thomas Shoal is emblematic of how great powers are becoming involved in the security architecture in Asia, with states such as the Philippines increasingly turning to the U.S. and other powers to increase deterrence and security, according to Geopolitica's Paisentini. ""Non intervention [ if China gets more aggressive] would cause a massive blow not only in U.S.-Philippines relations, but also in the relationship between the U.S. and other key regional allies,"" he added.

Honor

HANGZHOU, China — The transforming power of artificial intelligence is of no value unless user data is protected, CEO of Chinese smartphone company Honor, George Zhao, told CNBC in an exclusive interview on Thursday. His comments come as Apple this month announced it will start rolling out personalized AI tools on certain devices in the U.S. this fall. Honor already integrates some AI functions, such as enabling users to open text messages and other notifications just by looking at them, or eliminating copy-paste steps by directly linking Yelp-like apps to navigation or ride-hailing apps. This week at Mobile World Congress in Shanghai, Honor unveiled new AI tools for detecting the use of deepfakes in videos, and for simulating lenses that can decrease myopia during long hours of screen usage. Zhao emphasized that Honor's approach is to keep AI operations involving personal data limited to the smartphone. It's also known as on-device AI, and stands in contrast with AI tools that tap cloud computing to operate.

""Without data security and user privacy protection, AI will become worthless,"" Zhao said in Mandarin, translated by CNBC. ""This has always been one of our value propositions."" ""We say user data doesn't leave [the device],"" Zhao said. ""This is a principle we adhere to."" Apple Intelligence, the iPhone company's AI product, claims that it uses on-device processing and draws on ""server-based models"" for more complex requests. Apple said its new ""Private Cloud Compute"" never stores user data. Honor says its on-device AI is self-developed, and the company is working with Baidu and Google Cloud for some other AI features. ""Overall, my view is that AI's development to date has two directions,"" Zhao said. ""Network [cloud] AI has become more and more powerful. But I believe on-device AI, in its capabilities and empowerment of consumers, will become more and more intimate, more and more understanding."" ""It will give consumers more support and help them interact with the future AI world,"" he added.

Zhao pointed out that many generative AI applications, such as from OpenAI's ChatGPT, require large amounts of computing power well beyond the battery capability of a single smartphone. That means they need to use the cloud, which raises questions about the security of data transfer. Balancing AI capabilities with energy usage and data privacy is a ""huge challenge"" for manufacturers, Zhao said. He said a system collecting lots of user data to deliver more personalized features becomes a ""stronger"" object compared to the individual using the system. ""In the future development of smartphones, our goal is that the individual becomes stronger,"" Zhao said. ""When an object becomes stronger, this will reveal the smallness of the individual in its presence. I believe mobile end devices need to empower and enable individuals.""

HANGZHOU, China — Apple 's mixed-reality headset began deliveries in China on Friday with a retail price roughly 18% higher than in the U.S.

The device starts at 29,999 yuan, or $4,128, in China, compared to a $3,500 retail price in the U.S.

When asked by CNBC, a customer surnamed Chen in Beijing said his suggestion to Apple CEO Tim Cook was to make Vision Pro cheaper by about 10,000 yuan, or $1,376. The customer, who did not share his first name due to concerns about speaking with foreign media, said many people in China might prefer to buy a secondhand Vision Pro because of the discounted price that typically comes with purchases from sellers unaffiliated with Apple.

Many of the most popular posts about the device on Chinese social media platform Weibo on Friday focused on the hashtag ""is it worth paying for the China version of Vision Pro,"" according to a CNBC translation.

CNBC has reached out to Apple for comment.

Greater China accounted for about 18% of Apple's revenue in the three months that ended March 30, according to an Apple filing.

Over the past year, Apple has faced growing competition from Huawei devices and other domestic brands, amid greater attention on national security.

Chen preordered his Vision Pro and was at a major store in Beijing to pick it up and receive some training on how to use it.

Store salespeople told CNBC that all of Friday's half-hour training sessions for preorders of the Vision Pro were booked up at Apple stores in Beijing — from 8 a.m. to 10 p.m.

This report is from this week's CNBC's ""Inside India"" newsletter which brings you timely, insightful news and market commentary on the emerging powerhouse and the big businesses behind its meteoric rise. Like what you see? You can subscribe here.

A curry without onions would be considered blasphemous by much of India.

So, even a modest change in the price of the bulbous vegetable soon becomes the talking point around dinner tables for hundreds of millions of people in the country.

And it has been for the past year.

The price of raw onions has risen 165% over the past year, according to the Lasalgaon Agriculture Produce Market Committee, which is India's largest wholesale onion market. Prices have also inflated for other vegetables, such as tomatoes, which now cost nearly twice as much as this time last year.

Poor weather has been behind much of the havoc. The drought last year and the ongoing heatwave, which CNBC has previously reported on, have disrupted the supply of staple foods such as grains and vegetables.

Temperatures in large parts of the country are about 4 to 9 degrees Celsius (7.2 to 16.2 Fahrenheit) above average for this time of the year. The high heat has spoilt large amounts of recently harvested and stored vegetables and is threatening to stop the planting of a fresh batch of crops.

Food prices, which rose an annual 8.7% in both April and May, account for nearly half of the overall consumer price basket. The sharp rise in the cost of food has kept headline inflation above the central bank's target of 4%, preventing it from cutting interest rates.

""The Indian economy remains hostage to intersecting food price shocks,"" Michael Patra, deputy governor of the Reserve Bank of India, said in his statement at the latest monetary policy meeting. ""Food prices are holding back any consideration of possible changes in the monetary policy stance,"" he added.

Keeping rates elevated, though, appears to be ""an unacceptably high growth sacrifice,"" according to Jayanth Varma, another member of the central bank's monetary policy committee, who voted to cut rates. Politically, an economic slowdown is unlikely to bode well for the newly elected BJP-led coalition government.

The anxiety was palpable this week when the government announced limits on traders stockpiling wheat.

""Imposing stock limits was just one option. We have many other tools at our disposal to ensure that wheat prices do not rise abnormally,"" food secretary Sanjeev Chopra told reporters and added that there was no shortage of wheat in the country.

The government also has the option to remove import taxes — currently set at 40% on wheat — to hold prices down.

Yet, Prime Minister Narendra Modi is stuck in a bind if he wants to gain favor with the country's farmers ahead of elections in two large agricultural states scheduled for later this year.

Lowering tariffs would enable grains to be imported from wherever they are cheaper and bring down their cost within India, but it will also undercut profits for local farmers.

For now, the prime minister has instead opted to raise the price the government is willing to pay farmers by 5.4% to about $275 per metric ton of rice. These grains are then redistributed to low-income families at no cost, making it the world's biggest food welfare program.

There are signs that these cost pressures are unlikely to abate soon due to further bad weather. This week, at least 200,000 people have been affected by the floods in India's northeastern region, a key rice-growing area.

But, an elevated inflation and interest rate environment haven't appeared to deter companies or investors.

""You talk to Indian companies, and even with inflation at 6%, they barely bat an eyelid because they're growing at twice that or more,"" said James Thom, lead fund manager of the abrdn New India Investment Trust , which trades like an ETF in London. ""[They] are used to operating with that level of inflation for decades.""

""That's just the norm,"" he added.","A seller is arranging onions at a vegetable market in Nagaon district, in the northeastern state of Assam, India, on February 1, 2024.

The Financial Action Task Force, an international watchdog organization dedicated to combating money laundering and illicit cash flows, on Friday removed Turkey from its ""gray list"" of countries that need special monitoring, handing a major vote of confidence to the country in the midst of its economic turnaround efforts.

""The FATF welcomes Türkiye's significant progress in improving its AML/CFT regime,"" the Paris-based organization wrote in its latest report, using the Turkish government's spelling of its country's name and the acronym for anti-money laundering and combating the financing of terrorism.

It said that Turkey had strengthened the effectiveness of its AML/CFT regime to address ""deficiencies"" that FATF listed in its October 2021 monitoring report.

Those deficiencies included FATF concerns over unregistered money transfer services, insufficient resources dedicated to terrorist financing investigations, alleged involvement in sanctions evasion, lack of oversight on high-risk sectors used for money laundering such as banking and real estate, and insufficient oversight of nonprofit organizations that could be used for terrorist financing, among others.

The FATF in its 2021 report had found sectors like banking, construction and property in Turkey vulnerable to illicit financing of United Nations-sanctioned groups like the Islamic State and al-Qaeda.","As the sunsets, a ferry boat glides across the waters of the Golden Horn with the Suleymaniye Mosque and the city of Istanbul, Turkey in the background.

""It's worth paying attention to value,"" the firm's head of research told CNBC's ""ETF Edge"" this week. ""It feels like … [for a] long time that growth has outperformed value.""

On Friday, the Russell indexes underwent their annual reconstitution to reflect changes in the market as companies grow and shift. The iShares Russell 1000 Growth ETF is up 20% so far this year, while the iShares Russell 1000 Value ETF is up almost 6%.

""We do think there's a place for both growth and value within a broader portfolio — just people are skewed more toward growth heading into the second half of the year,"" he added. ""There have been periods when the pendulum has swung back in favor of value.""

FTSE Russell CEO Fiona Bassett said on ""ETF Edge"" the indices are built to reflect the nature of the market.

""One of the benefits of the Russell franchise generally is our ability to provide different sleeves of exposure,"" she said. ""So, for those people who want to get concentrated exposure to value or to growth, we have the indices available to do that.""

Marco Bello | Reuters

President Joe Biden's raspy, unfocused, often inarticulate and widely panned debate performance stoked deep anxiety among Democrats — and caused some commentators and fundraisers to openly call for a new nominee to run against former President Donald Trump. But replacing Biden as the party's pick less than five months out from Election Day carries enormous political risks and would be difficult, if not impossible, to pull off. Right now, the only likely way Biden could be replaced is if he willingly ends his campaign. And Biden's aides and top Democratic officials say the 81-year-old incumbent has no plans to do so. If he did drop out, Democrats have yet to identify a clear alternative candidate to swap in. But the panic among donors and party officials after watching Biden falter Thursday night in his debate against Trump has led some of them to take steps to get Biden out of the race. There are already discussions among Democratic fundraisers about trying to convince congressional leaders — Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer in particular — to urge Biden to announce to drop out, according to people familiar with the matter who were granted anonymity to speak freely.

Saul Loeb | AFP | Getty Images

Schumer, D-N.Y., is a top target for donors making that pitch because he privately has voiced concerns about Biden's standings in presidential election polls, those people said. Schumer was worried before the debate that Biden and Trump were statistically tied nationally, despite the Republican challenger's conviction in his New York criminal hush money trial. A spokesman for Schumer declined to comment to CNBC but pointed to a social media post the majority leader published after the debate. Schumer in that X post wrote: ""Tonight's debate made the choice clear: Four more years of progress, or four more years of attacks on our fundamental rights and our democracy."" ""We've got to get out the vote for Joe Biden, Kamala Harris, and a Democratic Senate and House!"" the post said. That spin has not alleviated the post-debate anxiety felt by some of the president's top fundraisers. Some of those wealthy donors have lost trust in Biden's team, believing they were given false assurances about Biden's ability to take on Trump. And some of those donors who already planned to attend a high-dollar fundraiser Saturday in the Hamptons section of Long Island say they will attend the event to judge for themselves whether Biden can continue as a viable candidate. ""Democrats are in a very difficult situation because it's late in the campaign for a change,"" said Meena Bose, director of the Peter S. Kalikow Center for the Study of the American Presidency at Hofstra University, in an interview with CNBC. The only feasible way Bose could see it playing out is with Biden throwing his full support behind Vice President Kamala Harris to become the new nominee.

Otherwise, Democrats have a wide-open nomination fight just a few months before the Nov. 5 election, she said. Bose called that a ""disastrous"" prospect."" ""Vice President Harris is a risky choice, but certainly has the visibility and is the logical choice,"" said Bose. ""It's difficult to see how you open up the Democratic presidential nomination now and have a unified path to victory in November,"" she added.

However, even if Biden backed Harris to replace him ahead of the Democratic National Convention in August, there is no guarantee that the delegates he has won so far will shift their support to her. Biden has won nearly all of the roughly 4,000 Democratic-pledged delegates, far exceeding the threshold to make him the party nominee. If Biden refuses to drop out before August, the only opportunity to boot him as nominee would be at the Democratic National Convention that month. It is technically possible that Biden's delegates could abandon him en masse then and throw open the convention to nominate another candidate. Some Democrats who want an alternative to Biden but are concerned about Harris' relatively low opinion polls and rocky campaign history have looked to California Gov. Gavin Newsom, Ohio Sen. Sherrod Brown, Illinois Gov. J.B. Pritzker and others as possible contenders.

But blocking Biden from the nomination is highly improbable, as delegates tend to be strong supporters of their chosen candidate. ""That is probably the worst-case scenario,"" Bose said. ""If the Democrats are going to have a change at the top of the ticket, President Biden has to endorse it and, frankly, probably initiate it."" The DNC rules allow for the party to select another presidential nominee, but only in the ""event of death, resignation or disability"" that leaves the role vacant.

ATTA KENARE | AFP

Iran is voting for its next president Friday in a snap election following the unexpected death of former President Ebrahim Raisi in a helicopter crash — and the outcome could have implications far beyond its borders. While there was no clear frontrunner leading up to the vote, all but one of the six candidates approved to run are conservative hardliners — and half of them have been sanctioned by Western governments. Of the six initial contenders, four remain in the race after two dropped out on Thursday. If there is no clear majority after Friday's vote, the top two candidates face a second round of voting on July 5. The winner will serve for four years — and faces no shortage of challenges. The election comes at a fraught time for the country of 88 million, and turnout is expected to be low. Iranians will go to the polls against the backdrop of a battered economy, widespread popular discontent and harsh crackdowns on dissent. Iran is also dealing with high inflation, heavy Western sanctions, mounting tensions with the U.S., ramped-up Iranian nuclear enrichment and the Israel-Hamas war. Voting is open to roughly 61 million eligible Iranians, but many have pledged to boycott, pointing out the lack of genuine choice for voters. Iran's ultra-conservative Guardian Council controls who is allowed on the ballot and only approved six candidates to run for the presidency, out of a list of 80 registrants.

watch now

Most of the candidates are hardliners who hold staunch anti-Western positions, with just one representing the reformist camp. Women who had registered to run were all disqualified by the Council. Iran's last presidential and parliamentary elections in 2021 and March 2024, respectively, saw the lowest recorded voter turnout in the Islamic Republic's history. Many observers expect that trend to continue. ""In the past, the government has put great emphasis on participation to claim popular legitimacy as a republic ... the decline in turnout over the last several years underscores the public's growing disillusionment with the system,"" Iran analysts Ali Vaez and Naysan Rafat at the think tank Crisis Group wrote in a report. ""Many citizens have come to doubt that they can produce meaningful change through the ballot box,"" they wrote. ""A major reversal of that trend appears unlikely.""

Who is running?

Two candidates appear to be leading the race, according to national polls: Mohammad Bagher Qalibaf and Saeed Jalili, both staunch conservatives. The candidate field features only one reformist candidate, Masoud Pezeshkian. Two of the six initial contenders, Amirhossein Ghazizadeh Hashemi and Alireza Zakani, dropped out of the race on Thursday. Mohammad Bagher Qalibaf: Iran's current speaker of Parliament and a former Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC) commander, Qalibaf also previously served as mayor of Tehran and has already made three attempts at running for the presidency. Saeed Jalili: A former nuclear negotiator, Jalili currently serves as a representative for supreme leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei on the Supreme National Security Council, known to be the most hardline wing of the regime. Jalili is further on the right politically than Qalibaf and a longtime Iranian government insider, but has also had several failed attempts at running for office. Masoud Pezeshkian: The sole reformist candidate in the field, Pezeshkian formerly served as minister of health and has been a parliament member since 2008. He is a member of the Islamic Consultative Assembly and the vice speaker of Parliament, and wants to loosen social restrictions like Iran's strict hijab law and improve relations with the West, including potentially re-starting nuclear talks with world powers. Mostafa Pourmohammadi: The only cleric in the race, Pourmohammadi formerly served as a prosecutor of the Revolutionary Court and deputy minister in Iran's Ministry of Intelligence, working under both conservative and reformist presidencies.

Where the real power lies

Iran's next president will have to contend with whoever takes the White House in November. This raises the stakes for both Tehran and Washington, as well as the Middle East writ large, as Iran comes closer than ever to nuclear bomb-production capability and continues to back proxy groups fighting Israel. On issues of foreign policy and war, the Iranian president wields some influence and is the country's public-facing messenger. But power and critical decision-making in Iran ultimately lies with the supreme leader, Ayatollah Khamenei, and unelected institutions like the Revolutionary Guards.

Nike CEO John Donahoe appears to be on thin ice. The former top executive of eBay , who has been at the helm of Nike since January 2020, is starting to lose Wall Street's confidence after the company capped off a lackluster fiscal year with more bad news. On Thursday, Nike warned that sales in its current quarter were expected to decline by a staggering 10% – far worse than the 3.2% drop LSEG had projected – after it posted its slowest annual sales gain in 14 years, excluding the Covid-19 pandemic. The company also said it expects fiscal 2025 sales to be down mid-single digits when it previously expected them to grow. The warning signs led shares to close 20% lower on Friday -- making it the worst trading day in the company's history since its IPO in Dec. 1980. The plunge wiped about $28 billion off of Nike's market cap, bringing it to just under $114 billion from $142 billion a day earlier. As Wall Street digested the dismal outlook from the world's largest sportswear company, at least six investment banks downgraded Nike's stock. Analysts at Morgan Stanley and Stifel took it a step further, specifically calling the company's management into question. ""The FY25 guide (the 5th downward consensus revision in 6 quarters), pushes prospects for growth inflection further into 2025 (perhaps FY4Q or spring '25 at the earliest) asking investors to both underwrite success of not yet proven styles and look across an uncertain consumer discretionary backdrop into 2HCY24 until momentum could build again into 2HCY25,"" wrote Stifel analyst Jim Duffy. ""Management credibility is severely challenged and potential for C-level regime change adds further uncertainty.""

Stock Chart Icon Stock chart icon Nike stock has underperformed the S&P 500 during CEO John Donahoe's tenure.

Since Donahoe took over as Nike's top executive, its stock is down more than 25% as of Friday's close, significantly underperforming both the S&P 500 and the XRT – the retail-focused ETF – which saw gains of around 67% and 66% in that time period, respectively. Nike finance chief Matt Friend on Thursday attributed the guidance cut to a host of factors. Some, like softness in China and challenging foreign exchange headwinds, are outside of Nike's control, but others are problems it squarely created under Donahoe's leadership. The company is expecting wholesale orders to be slow as it scales new styles, pulls back on classic franchises and works to repair its relationships with key retail partners after spending the last few years cutting them off in favor of a direct-selling strategy. At the same time, loyal customers who shop on Nike's website are no longer springing for new pairs of Air Force 1s, Air Jordan 1s or Dunks, the company's core franchises. Critics say the sneaker lines have dominated the retailer's offerings for too long and turned customers away as they sought fresh styles and innovative designs from a slew of upstart competitors. That's left Nike to win back some of its most essential customers – runners. As the retailer focused on its direct-selling strategy at the expense of innovation, scrappy competitors like On Running and Hoka snatched up market share.","In this article NKE Follow your favorite stocks CREATE FREE ACCOUNTJohn Donahoe, attends the first day of the annual Allen & Company Sun Valley Conference, in Sun Valley, Idaho.

CNBC,https://www.cnbc.com/2024/06/28/french-election-le-pens-far-right-national-rally-election-gains.html,2024-06-28,13:48:52 UTC,France's far right looks headed for victory in the first round at the polls. Here's what that means,"Jordan Bardella, President of the National Rally (Rassemblement National), a French nationalist and right-wing populist party, speaks to over 5,000 supporters at his final rally ahead of the upcoming European Parliament election on June 9th, at Le Dôme de Paris - Palais des Sports, on June 2, 2024., France, on June 2, 2024, in Paris, France. Nurphoto | Getty Images

With just days to go until France's snap parliamentary election kicks off, victory for the far right looks increasingly likely in the first phase of the two-stage runoff. Marine Le Pen's National Rally and its allies are seen winning 36% of votes, signaling growing support for the party's euroskeptic, anti-immigration agenda, according to the latest opinion polls from Elabe released ahead of the first vote on June 30. The left-wing New Popular Front, meanwhile, is projected behind with 27%, while President Emmanuel Macron's Renaissance party is predicted to clinch 20% of the support, as of June 27. The shift away from centrist politics has spooked investors and analysts, who warn of implications ranging from ""political paralysis"" to ""immediate financial crisis."" But predicting the outcome of France's final vote on July 7 is less clear cut, given the complexity of France's voting system. CNBC takes a look at the likelihood of a far-right French victory and the impact for markets.

A complex system

Under France's two-stage voting system, all parliamentary candidates who receive at least 12.5% of locally registered voters progress to the second-round runoff — a feat that the National Rally is likely to achieve in a large number of constituencies. But even with sweeping gains in the first round, the party could be stumped at the final hurdle by voters using ""le vote utile"" — or tactical voting — to keep them out. That was seen as part of Macron's gamble when the French leader called the surprise vote following the National Rally's record 31.3% gain in this month's European Parliament elections. Others say the president hopes to discredit his competitors ahead of France's 2027 presidential election, with Macron since claiming there will be ""civil war"" if either extreme wins. Voter turnout for the national election is also expected to be larger — and therefore more representative — than the 51% who cast their ballot in the EU vote. With that in mind, analysts see a 30% to 40% chance of the National Rally winning the 289 seats needed to secure an absolute majority in the 577-seat National Assembly. A more likely outcome, however, would be major gains for the far right, with the National Rally potentially becoming the biggest party in France, but ultimately falling short of a majority and leading to a highly divided hung parliament.

Market turmoil

Such a stalemate could leave France with lower trend growth, elevated yield spreads and a ""worse reputation globally,"" Holger Schmieding, chief economist at Berenberg Bank, told CNBC on Monday. Already, France's blue-chip CAC 40 index is heading for its worst month since May 2023, having lost as much as 6% since the vote was announced on June 9. The spread between French and German borrowing costs — a key indicator of French political risk — has also jumped to its widest in more than a decade. A majority government for either the far-right or the ultra-left alliance, meanwhile, could spark a far more dramatic outcome.

""Spendthrift agendas"" from either party — whose policies both include lowering the retirement age and cutting income tax — could result in an ""immediate financial crisis,"" Schmieding suggested. Citi analysts said in a note Thursday that markets were currently ""too optimistic"" about a benign outcome, adding that its higher probability scenarios of gridlock or an extreme parliament could lead to a 5% to 20% fall in French equity valuations. ""Combined with our finding that French equities tend to be more volatile than peers' around elections, this could be reason to expect additional choppiness from here,"" the analysts noted.

Political paralysis

The CEO of Paris-based Euronext, Europe's biggest stock exchange group, sought to quell investor concerns earlier this week, telling the Financial Times that neither the left nor the right would be able to implement their more extreme policies amid checks and balances from the president, ratings agencies and the European Union. On Monday, Jordan Bardella — Le Pen's 28-year-old protege, who could become prime minister under a strong showing for the National Rally — was seen stepping back on some more extreme measures, vowing to implement ""reasonable"" spending plans. That includes an aim to bring France's deficit back to the EU limit of 3% of GDP. Even with more measured fiscal plans, however, parliamentary gridlock could make such policies difficult to enact. Bardella, for his part, has recently stressed that he would ""need an absolute majority to govern,"" in a bid to boost his backing. ""You start with deficit at 5.5%, debt at 110%, you're unable to do anything for the next three years, which means that deficits are just not coming down. To me that's the biggest issue that France faces right now,"" Jefferies' chief financial economist for Europe, Mohit Kumar, told CNBC's ""Squawk Box Europe"" on Tuesday.","Nurphoto | Getty ImagesWith just days to go until France's snap parliamentary election kicks off, victory for the far right looks increasingly likely in the first phase of the two-stage runoff.
But predicting the outcome of France's final vote on July 7 is less clear cut, given the complexity of France's voting system.

CNBC,https://www.cnbc.com/2024/06/29/ikigai-3-daily-practices-for-a-long-and-happy-life-.html,2024-06-29,19:36:59 UTC,"These 3 daily practices are the Japanese 'secret' for a 'long and happy life,' says authors of 'Ikigai'","Here are a few of the practices that contribute to the longevity and happiness of some of Japan's longest-living people.

The island's age-defying residents caught the attention of authors Héctor García and Francesc Miralles. The pair interviewed over 100 of the oldest people in Okinawa and wrote about the principles and techniques that Japanese centenarians adhere to daily in their book titled Ikigai: The Japanese Secret to a Long and Happy Life .

On average, Okinawan women live longer lives than women from all other areas worldwide, according to longevity expert Dan Buettner . Additionally, ""Okinawans have less cancer, heart disease and dementia than Americans,"" Buettner wrote on his site .

Blue Zones are areas in the world with the most people living the longest lives.

If you, like many others, have ever fallen down a rabbit hole trying to learn more about what causes some people to live longer and feel more happiness, then you've probably already heard of Blue Zones like Okinawa, Japan.

1. Engage in low-intensity movement for at least 5 minutes a day

Just about every super-ager that García and Miralles spoke to shared that they regularly practice radio taiso which is a well-known, decades-old Japanese exercise.

""Even the residents of the nursing home we visited dedicated at least five minutes every day to it, though some did the exercises from their wheelchairs,"" the authors wrote in their book.

It helps that the exercise calls for low-intensity movements and can be completed in five minutes or less. And what makes the practice really stand out is that it's typically done among groups of people.

One of the main goals of radio taiso is to ""promote a spirit of unity among participants,"" according to García and Miralles.

2. Find a purpose and stay busy

There's a Japanese proverb that states: ""Only staying active will make you want to live a hundred years."" Okinawans achieve this by finding their ikigai, or purpose, that encourages them to focus on their deeper meaning in life.

Ikigai can be loosely translated to ""the happiness of always being busy."" Often, people who live the longest don't retire.

For example, Hayao Miyazaki, 83, is the director of animated films at Studio Ghibli in Japan. A day after retiring in the 90s, Miyazaki came to work to sketch new animations; he just released a movie in 2023.

3. Achieving a state of flow

""There is no magic recipe for finding happiness, for living according to your ikigai,"" García and Miralles wrote in their book. ""But one key ingredient is the ability to reach this state of flow and, through this state, to have an 'optimal experience.'""

Flow is a concept used to describe being fully engaged in an action, and it was coined by psychologist Mihaly Csikszentmihalyi.

Being engulfed in a state of flow allows you to be more present, improve your focus and temporarily forget about your worries, according to García and Miralles.

""The happiest people are not the ones who achieve the most,"" they wrote. ""They are the one who spend more time than others in a state of flow.""

Amazon is ramping up its development of artificial intelligence technology, hiring top talent from AI agent startup Adept and licensing the company's technology.

Rohit Prasad, a senior vice president and head scientist who oversees Amazon's artificial general intelligence unit, wrote in a memo to employees on Friday that the company hired Adept co-founder and CEO David Luan and ""a few other deeply talented team members to our AGI team.""

Luan will oversee Amazon's ""AGI Autonomy"" division, and report to Prasad, he wrote in the memo, which CNBC obtained. Amazon confirmed the contents of the memo. Geekwire was first to report on it.

Amazon faces fierce competition in AI, as rivals Microsoft and Google rapidly add new features into their core products while also giving businesses more ways to access large language models in their public cloud offerings. Amazon's cloud unit has launched a range of AI services, including its own models, which are generally viewed as lagging behind the top competitors.

Amazon has also pumped billions of dollars into OpenAI competitor Anthropic, and it's planning to overhaul its Alexa voice assistant with a new paid version that has generative AI capabilities. Prasad, who previously served as a head scientist for Alexa, was tapped in August to steer Amazon's development of AGI, or software that's significantly more advanced than current AI and starts to approach human-level capabilities.

Last month, Amazon announced Adam Selipsky, the head of Amazon Web Services, would be stepping down and succeeded by Matt Garman, the head of sales at marketing at AWS.","The front desk of the Amazon office is pictured in New York, May 1, 2019.

JPMorgan Chase and Morgan Stanley said Friday that they were boosting both dividend payouts and share repurchases, while rivals Citigroup and Bank of America made more modest announcements.

JPMorgan, the biggest U.S. bank by assets, said it was raising its quarterly dividend 8.7% to $1.25 per share and that it authorized a new $30 billion share repurchase program.

Morgan Stanley, a dominant player in wealth management, said it was boosting its dividend 8.8% to 92.5 cents per share and authorized a $20 billion repurchase plan.

Citigroup said it was raising its dividend 5.7% to 56 cents per share and that it would ""continue to assess share repurchases"" on a quarterly basis.

Bank of America said it was increasing its dividend 8% to 26 cents per share. Its release made no mention of share repurchases.

The big banks announced their plans to boost capital return to shareholders after passing the annual stress test administered by the Federal Reserve this week. While all 31 banks in this year's exam showed regulators they could withstand a severe hypothetical recession, JPMorgan said Wednesday that it could have higher losses than the Fed initially found.

Still, that would not affect its capital-return plan, the New York-based bank said Friday.

""The strength of our company allows us to continually invest in building our businesses for the future, pay a sustainable dividend, and return any remaining excess capital to our shareholders as we see fit,"" JPMorgan CEO Jamie Dimon said in his company's release.

Warren Buffett on Friday made his biggest annual donation to date, giving $5.3 billion worth of Berkshire Hathaway shares to five charities.

The legendary investor, who's turning 94 in August, converted 8,674 of his Berkshire Class A shares to donate more than 13 million Class B shares, according to a statement Friday. A total of 9.93 million shares went to the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation, with the rest going to the Susan Thompson Buffett Foundation, named for his late first wife, and the three charities led by his children Howard, Susan and Peter Buffett.

The ""Oracle of Omaha"" has pledged to give away the fortune he built at Berkshire, the Omaha, Nebraska-based conglomerate he started running in 1965. Buffett has been making annual donations to the five charities since 2006.

After Friday's donations, Buffett owns 207,963 Berkshire A shares and 2,586 B shares, worth about $130 billion.

New charitable trust

In an interview with The Wall Street Journal, Buffett clarified that after his death, the enormous fortune he amassed from building the one-of-a-kind conglomerate will be directed to a new charitable trust overseen by his three children.

""It should be used to help the people that haven't been as lucky as we have been,"" he told the Journal. ""There's eight billion people in the world, and me and my kids, we've been in the luckiest 100th of 1% or something. There's lots of ways to help people.""

Buffett has previously said his three children are the executors of his will as well as the named trustees of the charitable trust that will receive 99%-plus of his wealth.

He told the Journal that the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation will no longer receive donations after his death. Buffett resigned as a trustee at the Gates Foundation in June 2021 in the midst of Bill and Melinda Gates' divorce.

At Berkshire's annual meeting in May, Buffett spoke candidly to shareholders about a future when he's no longer at the helm, appearing solemn at times as he pondered his advanced age and reflected on his late friend and business partner Charlie Munger.

Greg Abel, vice chairman for noninsurance operations at Berkshire, has been named Buffett's successor and has taken on most of the responsibility at the conglomerate.

Buffett previously said his will will be made public after his death.

""After my death, the disposition of my assets will be an open book – no 'imaginative' trusts or foreign entities to avoid public scrutiny but rather a simple will available for inspection at the Douglas County Courthouse,"" Buffett said in November.","Warren Buffett speaks during the Berkshire Hathaway Annual Shareholders Meeting in Omaha, Nebraska on May 4, 2024.

The U.S. is the only G20 economy to see growth above pre-pandemic levels, and ""robust"" growth indicates ongoing upside risks to inflation, the 190-country agency said.

""We do recognize important upside risks,"" IMF Managing Director Kristalina Georgieva said at a press briefing on Thursday. ""Given those risks, we agree that the Fed should keep policy rates at current levels until at least late 2024."" The Fed's current fed funds rate has stood within the range of 5.25% to 5.50% since July 2023.

The IMF, often called the world's ""lender of last resort,"" forecasts that the core personal consumption expenditures price index — the Fed's preferred measure of inflation — will end 2024 at around 2.5% and reach the Fed's 2% target rate by mid-2025, ahead of the Fed's own projection for 2026.

U.S. economic strength during the Fed's rate-hike cycle was aided by labor supply and productivity gains, Georgieva said, while highlighting the need for ""clear evidence"" that inflation is coming down to the 2% target before the Fed cuts rates.

Nonetheless, the IMF's ""more optimistic"" assessment of the downward inflation trajectory is based on indications of a cooling labor market in the U.S. and weakening consumer demand.

""I want to recognize that a lesson we learned from the last [few] years is we are at a time of more uncertainty. This uncertainty also lies ahead. We are confident, however, that the Fed will move through that, and certainly with the same prudence it has demonstrated over the last year,"" Georgieva said.

Roaring Kitty, whose legal name is Keith Gill, has stirred up trading in speculative names such as GameStop by posting cryptic images and memes online. A picture of a cartoon dog appeared on his X feed Thursday afternoon, briefly driving up Chewy shares as much as 34% to $39.10. The stock later fell into negative territory again in Thursday's session, closing the day down 0.3%.

Chewy shares rallied dramatically on Thursday after meme stock leader Roaring Kitty posted a picture on social media platform X that resembles the logo of the online pet food retailer, but the gains were quickly erased later in the session.

There's also a strong connection between meme stock GameStop and Chewy. GameStop CEO Ryan Cohen was the founder and CEO of Chewy, who was instrumental in PetSmart's takeover of Chewy in 2017 and its subsequent initial public offering in 2019.

Cohen joined the GameStop board of directors along with two other Chewy executives in January 2021, partly helping fuel the initial GameStop rally. He later took over as GameStop CEO in 2023, leading a turnaround in the brick-and-mortar video game retailer.

Shares in pet retailers such as Chewy and Petco saw big spikes during the pandemic when stuck-at-home consumers adopted cats and dogs in droves. With the adoptions came purchases of needed accessories such as new beds and leashes for their furry family members.

But as the pandemic ended and people began venturing outside again, adoption numbers slowed and consumers had less need for discretionary pet items such as toys and cages, which carry higher profit margins than pet food.

Over the past year or so, Chewy and Petco have seen consistently strong pet food sales, but revenue for higher margin categories has fallen.

Gill is a former marketer for Massachusetts Mutual Life Insurance. He came into the limelight after successfully encouraging retail investors to buy GameStop shares and call options in 2021 to squeeze out short-selling hedge funds. The mania in 2021 led to a series of congressional hearings featuring Gill in brokers' practices and the ""gamification"" of retail trading.","A picture of a cartoon dog appeared on his X feed Thursday afternoon, briefly driving up Chewy shares as much as 34% to $39.10.
The stock later fell into negative territory again in Thursday's session, closing the day down 0.3%.

CNBC,https://www.cnbc.com/2024/06/27/jpmorgan-chase-fed-stress-test-results-error.html,2024-06-27,14:34:23 UTC,JPMorgan Chase says its stress test losses should be higher than what the Fed disclosed,"JPMorgan Chase CEO and Chairman Jamie Dimon gestures as he speaks during the U.S. Senate Banking, Housing and Urban Affairs Committee oversight hearing on Wall Street firms, on Capitol Hill in Washington, D.C.

JPMorgan Chase said late Wednesday that the Federal Reserve overestimated a key measure of income in the giant bank's recent stress test, and that its losses under the exam should actually be higher than what the regulator found.

The bank took the unusual step of issuing a press release minutes before midnight ET to disclose its response to the Fed's findings.

JPMorgan said that the Fed's projections for a measure called ""other comprehensive income"" — which represents revenues, expenses and losses that are excluded from net income — ""appears to be too large.""

Under the Fed's table of projected revenue, income and losses though 2026, JPMorgan was assigned $13 billion in OCI, more than any of the 31 lenders in this year's test. It also estimated that the bank would face roughly $107 billion in loan, investment and trading losses in that scenario.

""Should the Firm's analysis be correct, the resulting stress losses would be modestly higher than those disclosed by the Federal Reserve,"" the bank said.

The error means that JPMorgan might require more time to finalize its share repurchase plan, according to a person with knowledge of the situation who declined to be identified speaking about the regulatory process. Banks were expected to begin disclosing those plans on Friday after the market closes.

The news is a wrinkle to the Federal Reserve's announcement Wednesday that all 31 of the banks in the annual exercise cleared the hurdle of being able to withstand a severe hypothetical recession, while maintaining adequate capital levels and the ability to lend to consumers and corporations.

Last year, Bank of America and Citigroup made similar disclosures, saying that estimates of their own future income differed from the Fed's results.

Banks have complained that aspects of the annual exam are opaque and that it's difficult to understand how the Fed produces some of its results.","The bank took the unusual step of issuing a press release minutes before midnight ET to disclose its response to the Fed's findings.

CNBC,https://www.cnbc.com/2024/06/26/fed-banks-stress-test-2024.html,2024-06-26,21:26:37 UTC,Federal Reserve says all 31 banks in annual stress test withstood a severe hypothetical downturn,"Federal Reserve Board Vice Chair for Supervision Michael Barr testifies before a House Financial Services Committee hearing on the response to the bank failures of Silicon Valley Bank and Signature Bank, on Capitol Hill in Washington, D.C., on March 29, 2023.

The Federal Reserve said Wednesday that the biggest banks operating in the U.S. would be able to withstand a severe recession scenario while maintaining their ability to lend to consumers and corporations.

Each of the 31 banks in this year's regulatory exercise cleared the hurdle of being able to absorb losses while maintaining more than the minimum required capital levels, the Fed said in a statement.

The stress test assumed that unemployment surges to 10%, commercial real estate values plunge 40% and housing prices fall 36%.

""This year's results show that under our stress scenario, large banks would take nearly $685 billion in total hypothetical losses, yet still have considerably more capital than their minimum common equity requirements,"" said Michael Barr, the Fed's vice chair for supervision. ""This is good news and underscores the usefulness of the extra capital that banks have built in recent years.""

The Fed's stress test is an annual ritual that forces banks to maintain adequate cushions for bad loans and dictates the size of share repurchases and dividends. This year's version included giants such as JPMorgan Chase and Goldman Sachs , credit card companies including American Express and regional lenders such as Truist .

While no bank appeared to get badly tripped up by this year's exercise, which had roughly the same assumptions as the 2023 test, the group's aggregate capital levels fell 2.8 percentage points, which was worse than last year's decline.

That is because the industry is holding more consumer credit card loans and more corporate bonds that have been downgraded. Lending margins have also been squeezed compared to last year, according to the Fed.

""While banks are well-positioned to withstand the specific hypothetical recession we tested them against, the stress test also confirmed that there are some areas to watch,"" Barr said. ""The financial system and its risks are always evolving, and we learned in the Great Recession the cost of failing to acknowledge shifting risks.""

The Fed also performed what it called an ""exploratory analysis"" of funding stresses and a trading meltdown that applied to only the eight biggest banks.

In this exercise, the companies appeared to avoid disaster, despite a sudden surge in the cost of deposits combined with a recession. In a scenario where five large hedge funds implode, the big banks would lose between $70 billion and $85 billion.

""The results demonstrated that these banks have material exposure to hedge funds but that they can withstand different types of trading book shocks,"" the Fed said.

Morgan Stanley is pushing further into its adoption of artificial intelligence with a new assistant that is expected to take over thousands of hours of labor for the bank's financial advisors. The assistant, called Debrief, keeps detailed logs of advisors' meetings and automatically creates draft emails and summaries of the discussions, bank executives told CNBC. Morgan Stanley plans to release the program to the firm's roughly 15,000 advisors by early July, marking one of the most significant steps yet for the use of generative AI at a major Wall Street bank. While the company's earlier efforts involved creating a ChatGPT-like service to help advisors navigate the firm's reams of research, Debrief brings AI into direct contact with advisors' most prized resource: their relationships with rich clients. The program, built using OpenAI's GPT-4, essentially sits in on client Zoom meetings, replacing the note-taking that advisors or junior employees have been doing by hand, according to Jeff McMillan, Morgan Stanley's head of firmwide artificial intelligence. ""What we're finding is that the quality and depth of the notes are just significantly better,"" McMillan told CNBC. ""The truth is, this does a better job of taking notes than the average human.""

Consent required

Importantly, clients must consent to being recorded each time Debrief is used. Future versions will allow advisors to use the program on corporate devices during in-person meetings, said McMillan. The rollout will serve as a real-world test for the vaunted productivity gains of generative AI, which took Wall Street by storm in recent months and has bolstered the value of chipmakers, tech giants and the broader U.S. stock market. Morgan Stanley's wealth management division hosts about 1 million Zoom calls a year, the bank told CNBC. While estimates vary, one Morgan Stanley advisor involved in the Debrief pilot said the program saves 30 minutes of work per meeting; advisors typically spend time after meetings creating notes and action plans to address client needs.

""As a financial adviser I'm doing four, five or six meetings a day,"" said Don Whitehead, a Houston-based advisor who's been testing the software. By ""having the note-taking service built in through AI, you can really be invested in the meeting, you're actually a lot more present."" It remains to be seen what advisors will do with the hours reclaimed from essential grunt work. In a sense, Morgan Stanley's projects in generative AI amount to a ""grand experiment in productivity,"" said McMillan. If, as McMillan and others believe, advisors will spend more time serving clients and prospecting for new ones, the technology should boost Morgan Stanley's growth in assets under management, as well as retention of clients and advisors. Morgan Stanley's wealth management division is one of the world's largest with $5.5 trillion in client assets as of March; the firm wants to reach $10 trillion. It will take at least a year to determine whether the technology is boosting advisor productivity, McMillan said. ""I'm the analytics guy, but the advisors will tell you that they're at their best when they're engaging"" with clients, said McMillan. ""None of them will tell you they love taking notes or looking at research reports, right? That's not why they got into this business.""

""I believe the governments [of China and the European Union] are now considering how, through negotiations, they can combine investment together with commodity trade,"" said Wan Gang, now president of the China Association for Science and Technology.

Wan was speaking via an official English translation during a livestream of a panel at the World Economic Forum's ""Summer Davos"" meeting in Dalian, China. Spokespersons for the European Commission were not immediately available when contacted by CNBC.

Regarding specifics, China's Ministry of Foreign Affairs referred CNBC to the Chinese authorities ""in charge,"" according to a CNBC translation of the Chinese. The ministry said China and the EU are each other's most important trade and investment partners, and that China hoped the EU would keep its trade and investment markets open.

China's Ministry of Commerce did not immediately respond to a request for comment outside of business hours on Thursday. The Commerce Ministry's spokesperson told reporters earlier in the day that the Chinese and European working groups remain in close consultations.

The Commerce Ministry had said over the weekend that it was launching consultations with the EU over the bloc's probe into the role of subsidies in Chinese electric cars. The EU said earlier this month that it would increase tariffs on imports of the vehicles.

""Even though we are not exporting a large number of EVs, perhaps the Chinese companies can try investing in Europe,"" Wan said, noting that such funding could create local jobs.","HEFEI, China — The man who spearheaded China's electric car strategy said Wednesday that Chinese investment in the European electric vehicles industry could be a way forward for both sides amid trade tensions.

CNBC,https://www.cnbc.com/2024/06/26/your-401k-is-up-but-a-new-report-says-americans-need-to-save-more-.html,2024-06-26,11:00:06 UTC,"Your 401(k) is up, and a new report shows increased savings. But Americans need to do more","How's your 401(k) looking? A new report shows Americans are saving more, but probably need to do even more.

Vanguard has released its annual report, How America Saves 2024. Vanguard and Fidelity are the two biggest sponsors of 401(k) plans, and this is a snapshot of what nearly five million participants are doing with their money.

The good news: stock market returns are up and, thanks largely to automatic enrollment plans, investors are saving more than they did in the past.

The bad news: account balances for the median 401(k) of a person approaching retirement (65+) remains very low.

The takeaway: Americans are still very reliant on Social Security for a large chunk of their retirement.

Higher returns, participation rates, savings rates

Why do we care so much about 401(k) plans? Because it's the main private savings vehicle Americans have for retirement. More than 100 million Americans are covered by these ""defined contribution"" plans, with more than $10 trillion in assets.

First, 2023 was a good year to be an investor. The average total return rate for participants was 18.1%, the best year since 2019.

But to be effective vehicles for retirement, these plans need to: 1) have high participation rates, and 2) hold high levels of savings.

On those fronts, there is good news. John James, managing director of Vanguard's Institutional Investor Group, called it ""a year of progress.""

Plan participation reached all-time highs. Thanks to a change in the law several years ago, a record-high 59% of plans offered automatic enrollment in 401(k) plans. This is a major improvement: ipreviously, enrollment in 401(k) plans were often short of expectations because investors had to ""opt-in,"" that is they had to choose to participate in the plan. Because of indecision or simple ignorance, many did not. By switching to automatic enrollment, participants were automatically enrolled and had to ""opt-out"" if they did not want to participate.

The result: enrollment rates have gone up. Plans with automatic enrollment had a 94% participation rate, compared with 67% for voluntary enrollment plans.

Participant saving rates reached all time highs. The average participant deferred 7.4% of their savings. Including employee and employer contributions, the average total participant contribution rate was 11.7%.

A few other observations about Vanguard's 401(k) plan investors:

They prefer equities and target date funds. They love equities over bonds or any other investments. The average plan contribution to equities is 74%. A record-high 64% of all 2023 contributions went into target-date funds, which automatically adjust stock and bond allocations as the participant ages.

They don't trade much. In 2023, only 5% of nonadvised participants traded within their accounts; 95% did no trading at all. ""Over the past 15 years, we have generally observed a decline in participant trading,"" Vanguard said, which it partially attributed to increased adoption of target-date funds.

Despite gains in the market, account balances are still low

In 2023, the average account balance for Vanguard participants was $134,128, but the median balance (half had more, half had less) was only $35,286.

Why such a big difference between the average and the median? Because a small group of investors with large balances pull up the averages. Forty percent of participants had less than $20,000 in their retirement accounts.

Median balances for those near retirement are still low

A different way to look at the problem is to ask how much people who are retirement age have saved, because it's an indication of how prepared they are for imminent retirement.

Investors 65 years or older had an average account balance of $272,588, but a median balance of only $88,488.

A median balance of $88,488 is not much when you consider older participants have higher incomes and higher savings rates. That is not much money for a 65-year old nearing retirement.

Of course, these balances don't necessarily reflect total lifetime savings. Some have more than one retirement plan because they had other plans with previous employers. Most do have other sources of retirement savings, typically Social Security. A shrinking number may also have a pension. Some may have money in checking accounts, or have stocks or bonds outside a retirement account.

Regardless, the math does not look great

So let's do some retirement math.

A typical annual drawdown for a 401(k) account in retirement is about 4%. Drawing down 4% of $88,488 a year gets you $3,539 every 12 months.

Next, Social Security. As of January 2023, the average Social Security benefit was almost $1,689 per month, or about $20,268 per year.

Finally, even though pensions are a vanishing benefit, let's include them.

According to the Pension Rights Center, the median annual pension benefit for a private pension is $9,262 (government employees have higher benefits).

Here's our yearly retirement budget:

Personal savings $3,539

Pension $9,262

Social Security $20,264

Total: $33,065

It's certainly possibly to live on $33,000 a year, but this would likely only work if you own your home, have low expenses and live in a low-cost part of the country.

Even then, it would hardly be a robust retirement.

And these are the lucky ones. Only 57% of retirees have a tax-deferred retirement account like a 401(k) or IRA. Only 56% reported receiving income from a pension.

And that extra income largely determines whether a retiree feels good or bad about their retirement.

In 2023, four out five retirees said they were doing at least okay financially, but this varied tremendously depending on whether retirees had sources of income outside of Social Security. Only 52% of retirees who did not have private income said they were doing at least okay financially.

What can be done?

To have a more robust retirement, Americans are just going to have to save more.

One issue is investors still don't contribute the maximum amount allowed. Only 14% of participants saved the statutory maximum amount of $22,500 per year ($30,000 for those age 50 or older). The likely reason: most felt they couldn't afford to.

However, only 53% of even those with income over $150,000 contributed the maximum allowed. Given that the employee match is ""free money,"" one would think participants in that income bracket would rationally choose to max out their contribution. The fact that many still don't suggests that more investor education is needed.

Regardless, it's very dangerous to assume that retirees are going to be bailed out by an ever-rising stock market. Another year anywhere near 2022, when the S&P 500 was down 20%, and investor confidence in their financial future will likely deteriorate.","The bad news: account balances for the median 401(k) of a person approaching retirement (65+) remains very low.

Patrick Van Katwijk | Getty Images

AMSTERDAM — Europe is at risk of falling behind the U.S. and China on artificial intelligence as it focuses on regulating the technology, according to Prince Constantijn of the Netherlands. ""Our ambition seems to be limited to being good regulators,"" Constantijn told CNBC in an interview on the sidelines of the Money 20/20 fintech conference in Amsterdam earlier this month. Prince Constantijn is the third and youngest son of former Dutch Queen Beatrix and the younger brother of reigning Dutch King Willem-Alexander. He is special envoy of the Dutch startup accelerator Techleap, where he works to help local startups grow fast internationally by improving their access to capital, market, talent, and technologies. ""We've seen this in the data space [with GDPR], we've seen this now in the platform space, and now with the AI space,"" Constantijn added. European Union regulators have taken a tough approach to artificial intelligence, with formal regulations limiting how developers and companies can apply the technology in certain scenarios.

The bloc gave final approval to the EU AI Act, a ground-breaking AI law, last month. Officials are concerned by how quickly the technology is advancing and risks it poses around jobs displacement, privacy, and algorithmic bias. The law takes a risk-based approach to artificial intelligence, meaning that different applications of the tech are treated differently depending on their risk level. For generative AI applications, the EU AI Act sets out clear transparency requirements and copyright rules. All generative AI systems would have to make it possible to prevent illegal output, to disclose if content is produced by AI and to publish summaries of the copyrighted data used for training purposes. But the EU's Ai Act requires even stricter scrutiny for high-impact, general-purpose AI models that could pose ""systemic risk,"" such as OpenAI's GPT-4 — including thorough evaluations and compulsory reporting of any ""serious incidents."" Prince Constantijn said he's ""really concerned"" that the Europe's focus has been more on regulating AI than trying to become a leader innovating in the space. ""It's good to have guardrails. We want to bring clarity to the market, predictability and all that,"" he told CNBC earlier this month on the sidelines of Money 20/20. ""But it's very hard to do that in such a fast-moving space."" ""There are big risks in getting it wrong, and like we've seen in genetically modified organisms, it hasn't stopped the development. It just stopped Europe developing it, and now we are consumers of the product, rather than producers able to influence the market as it develops."" Between 1994 and 2004, the EU had imposed an effective moratorium on new approvals of genetically modified crops over perceived health risks associated with them.

The bloc subsequently developed strict rules for GMOs, citing a need to protect citizens' health and the environment. The U.S. National Academies of Sciences says that genetically modified crops are safe for both human consumption and the environment. Constantijn added that Europe is making it ""quite hard"" for itself to innovate in AI due to ""big restrictions on data,"" particularly when it comes to sectors like health and medical science. In addition, the U.S. market is ""a much bigger and unified market"" with more free-flowing capital, Constantijn said. On these points he added, ""Europe scores quite poorly."" ""Where we score well is, I think, on talent,"" he said. ""We score well on technology itself."" Plus, when it comes to developing applications that use AI, ""Europe is definitely going to be competitive,"" Constantijn noted. He nevertheless added that ""the underlying data infrastructure and IT infrastructure is something we'll keep depending on large platforms to provide.""","Prince Constantijn is special envoy to Techleap, a Dutch startup accelerator.

DALIAN, China — For China's yuan to be used more globally, the currency needs more ""applications"" such as for stocks and bonds, Bonnie Chan, CEO of Hong Kong Exchanges and Clearing Limited, said on a panel Tuesday. Beijing has long touted its ambitions for increasing global use of the Chinese yuan — also known as the ""renminbi"" or ""RMB"" — in an international financial market where the U.S. dollar is the dominant currency. U.S. sanctions on Russia have also increased the pressure on some countries to have alternatives to the greenback. Chan, speaking during the World Economic Forum's ""Summer Davos"" meeting in Dalian, China, noted that people hold a currency for trade, or, more importantly, as a store of wealth. ""We're not just going to hold on to a bunch of RMB and put it into this bank account,"" she said. ""You want to have bonds, you want to have equities, etc."" ""One of our strategic imperatives [has] been changed to make sure that we continue to produce more RMB-denominated security products,"" Chan said, ""so that investors around the world can actually see more applications of the RMB and be able to use those as the medium to store wealth in the form of the RMB.""

Last year, the HKEX announced a ""Dual-Counter"" program that allows investors to trade Hong Kong-listed securities in Hong Kong dollars or Chinese yuan. In a significant step toward internationalization of the yuan, the International Monetary Fund in 2015 announced that it would add the yuan to its basket of reserve currencies the following year. The yuan was the fourth-most active currency for global payments by value in May, accounting for nearly 4.5% of such transactions, according to the interbank messaging network SWIFT. The U.S. dollar had a nearly 48% share. In trade finance, the yuan ranked third at about 5.1% in May, according to SWIFT. The euro was slightly higher at 5.6%, while the U.S. dollar dominated with a nearly 85% share, the data showed. Fred Hu, founder, chairman and CEO of Primavera Capital, said on the same panel Tuesday that the internationalization of the yuan is probably going to take longer than many expect, despite an increased amount of statements from Beijing. While China is the largest trading nation and has large financial centers, ""we're not as big, as deep as the U.S.,"" Hu said. ""Besides our capital account is also closed, it's not fully convertible, [which] also in some way [is] hampering the internationalization of the renminbi.""

A maturing financial market

Developing more Chinese yuan-denominated investment products also requires a maturation of the local financial sector. Part of that includes having a more sophisticated investor base. Chan said that during the annual Lujiazui Financial Forum in Shanghai last week, nearly every conversation with top leaders included the term ""patient investing."" The phrase has emerged in official releases to encourage long-term investing over short-term speculation. ""Patience comes from learning through the market volatility,"" Kenny Lam, CEO of Two Sigma Asia-Pacific, said during the same panel on Tuesday. He said that policymakers have been giving more thought to making their policies more stable and consistent.

Why life insurance purchases have 'steadily' fallen

Many Americans fail to plan for their mortality, neglecting to draft wills, put a power of attorney in place or designate beneficiaries for financial accounts. Overall, the share of households with life insurance has ""steadily"" decreased since the early 1970s, according to the ACLI. There are likely many reasons for that drop-off.

watch now

For one, younger generations are deferring big financial and life milestones such as getting married, buying a home and having kids relative to older generations. Each of these events generally acts as a key trigger to buy life insurance, experts said. Higher-costing homeownership and child care, coupled with rising debt burdens (for student loans, for example), may mean younger households are less willing or able to pay monthly insurance premiums, said Knoll, a senior financial planner at The Planning Center. Insurance costs themselves are also generally rising for consumers, Shapiro said. Additionally, life insurance is often not typically easy or quick to buy due to factors such as medical testing for underwriting, Shapiro said. ""It's a complex transaction,"" he said.

There are more benign factors at play, too: For instance, fewer consumers have sought out the tax benefits of certain life policies as other tax-advantaged savings options, such as 401(k) accounts and 529 plans, have come into existence, Knoll said. That said, even as fewer people buy life insurance, ""I do think there's a need for it,"" he added. Life insurance isn't necessarily right for everyone, though. Here are some key considerations.

When to buy life insurance

Consumers should consider their financial situation and the standard of living they want to maintain for survivors, such as dependents or spouses, according to the Illinois Department of Insurance. Absent a policyholder's income, there might be a financial shortfall in paying day-to-day household expenses, or for debts and big-ticket items such as tuition, for example. ""Who will be responsible for your funeral costs and final medical bills? Would your family have to relocate? Will there be adequate funds for future or ongoing expenses such as daycare, mortgage payments, or college?"" the department said in a consumer guide. Single people without kids may also have financial obligations, such as funeral expenses, medical bills, debts like credit cards or student loans, and financial support for elderly parents, the IDOI said.

What type of life insurance to buy

There are two broad types of life insurance: term and permanent. Term insurance will typically be best for most consumers, according to financial advisors. These policies last for a designated term, perhaps 10, 20 or 30 years. They generally carry fixed monthly premiums. The length of one's financial obligation is a good guide to the term one should choose, Shapiro said.

It's absolutely clear to me there's a very large gap here. Scott Shapiro U.S. insurance sector leader at KPMG

If a policyholder's spouse is 35 years old and the policyholder seeks a financial hedge until their spouse retires — perhaps at age 65 — the buyer might choose a term of 30 years, for example. Ensuring there's enough money for young kids to go to college might mean having a policy that lasts about 20 years. Permanent life insurance, such as a whole or universal life policy, is meant to last throughout life. It may make sense for consumers to pay for a lifelong policy if they want to leave a financial legacy for charities, or reasonably expect to develop a medical condition that can make it harder to get insurance later. Permanent insurance is generally more costly and complex than a term policy, advisors said. For example, it often carries an interest-bearing account in addition to the insurance component. Policyholders can build up cash value over time depending on factors such as dividends or investment returns. The cash value can have various uses: to pay insurance premiums, as collateral for a loan, or as cash in the event a buyer surrenders their policy in the future. However, there's a lot of fine print and consumers should avoid buying something they don't understand, advisors said.

Chinese EV-makers have ramped up their global expansion in the last year as domestic competition intensified.

However, trade tensions have escalated, with the U.S. and likely the European Union, increasing tariffs on imports of Chinese electric cars.

That doesn't necessarily restrict their growth. Chinese automakers, such as BYD, are investing in local factories.

Cisco, which provides networking equipment and software for businesses, is working with at least 10 electric car customers as they build factories, offices and research and development centers overseas, according to Wong.

DETROIT — Purchasing a vehicle has never been that easy. But shoppers entering traditional dealer showrooms for the foreseeable future may have a new challenge: An alphabet soup of ""electrified"" vehicle offerings. As all-electric vehicle adoption crawls along in the U.S., automakers are increasingly releasing various hybrid vehicles as alternative options to EVs and traditional gas-powered engines. A variety of models means more customer choice, but also more complexity for automakers and consumers, many of whom are returning to the new vehicle market for the first time in years following unprecedented supply chain shortages and record used vehicle prices. ""More choice in the marketplace is good for consumers, but only if they understand the differences,"" said Paul Waatti, director of industry analysis at AutoPacific. ""There needs to be more clarity on what the terms and acronyms actually mean, and what the potential benefits and drawbacks are."" A car shopper today has their pick of traditional internal combustion engine (ICE) vehicles; mild-hybrid electric vehicles (MHEVs); hybrid electric vehicles (HEVs); plug-in hybrid electric vehicles (PHEVs); fuel cell electric vehicles (FCEVs) and battery-electric vehicles (BEVs), also commonly known as EVs. Also coming later this year from Stellantis : range-extended electric vehicles (REEVs) that are similar to plug-in hybrid vehicles but can exclusively function as an EV, with its electric motors powered by a gas engine. Each type of vehicle may be better for a different kind of customer. All except EVs and fuel-cell vehicles continue to offer a traditional internal combustion engine combined with ""electrified"" technologies such as a battery or motor to assist in performance or fuel economy. Heather Seymour, of St. Johns, Florida, said she did quite a bit of research prior to purchasing a 2022 Jeep Wrangler Rubicon plug-in hybrid electric vehicle, known as a 4xe model. ""I knew I wanted to kind of dip my toe in the water of the hybrids. I wasn't ready to go full electric, so the plug-in was definitely of interest to me,"" said Seymour, who said she typically uses the all-electric range of the SUV, except on longer trips. ""The more we learned about it, the more we figured out what we wanted.""

EV naming

While consumers may not need to know every acronym or technology to find their right model, automakers aren't exactly helping the situation with their consumer-facing naming. For example, Hyundai's Genesis brand calls its all-electric vehicles ""electrified,"" while many others reserve that term for hybrids. Chrysler's Pacifica minivan is a plug-in hybrid labeled as a regular ""hybrid,"" and Toyota markets some of its traditional hybrids as ""hybrid EVs."" Stellantis says its REEV vehicles are not PHEVs, despite operating similarly. ""Every automaker is using different terms. There's no standardization, and that causes some confusion on the consumer side,"" Waatti said.

Some automakers such as General Motors also use traditional nameplates such as the Chevrolet Blazer and Equinox for new EVs that share little to nothing with their gas-powered counterparts other than the name. Stellantis' Jeep also uses the ""Wagoneer"" moniker for two large gas-powered SUVs as well as a smaller, all-electric Wagoneer ""S"" SUV. Jeep CEO Antonio Filosa has said he isn't worried about any confusion, as the brand has a strong naming heritage and customers can decide which vehicle is best for their needs. ""I believe that we need education, but after education we have a lot of choices for the consumer,"" he said during a recent interview. ""It's all for the benefit of the consumer. They will have a lot of flexibility.""

Education is key

One thing automotive executives from Japan and South Korea to Detroit and Germany can agree on is the need for consumer education. Whether vehicles are electrified or all-electric, they're critical for automakers to meet tightening emissions and fuel economy targets as well as to build production scale, reduce prices and increase profits.

Kia and its dealers have put out myth-busting pages online to answer concerns or frequently asked questions about EVs and hybrids. They range from technical questions about batteries to practical questions like whether you can go through a car wash in an EV (you can). GM has taken it a step further. The Detroit automaker launched ""EV Live"" in 2022. It's an online video platform, now known as ""GM Energy Live,"" that allows participants to interact one-on-one with EV specialists and learn about electric vehicles and charging. Ford Motor recently launched its own video-based training program, geared toward its more than 3,000 U.S. franchised dealers to improve customer service, better engage employees and provide dealers and the company with more data to help in selling the vehicles. Auto executives say it's up to the companies as well as their dealers to be trained and educated about the benefits of the vehicles, whatever they may be. ""Each customer, in the end, is very different,"" said Jérémie Papin, chair of Nissan Americas, earlier this year. ""I think it's what the vehicle can do for them,"" not necessarily how the technology works, he said.

Plug-in hybrid electric vehicle (PHEV) : These vehicles feature an internal combustion engine combined with a hybrid system, including a larger battery than traditional hybrid vehicles as well as a plug to recharge the vehicle's battery. They typically allow drivers to travel a certain number of miles using the battery before the engine is needed to power the car or truck.

Pfizer had a ""phenomenal"" first quarter — and Wall Street took notice, CEO Albert Bourla told thousands of employees during a companywide town hall on May 2, according to a recording heard by CNBC. A day earlier, the pharmaceutical giant's stock had closed 6% higher after its quarterly results topped analyst estimates and it hiked its full-year outlook. It was a far cry from the year prior, when Pfizer's shares plunged more than 40%, making it one of the worst-performing large pharmaceutical stocks of 2023. Its market cap of about $157 billion is now less than half of its 2021 peak of nearly $350 billion. Few companies benefited from the pandemic as much as Pfizer did. The drugmaker's profits boomed, fueled by its Covid vaccine and antiviral pill Paxlovid. After Pfizer and German company BioNTech rapidly developed and deployed a lifesaving shot that helped the world emerge from the pandemic, Pfizer drew widespread praise. Pfizer's success contributed to its equally jarring fall from grace. When the virus receded in 2023, its Covid products revenue plummeted. The world, which hailed Pfizer as a pandemic hero a few years earlier, no longer needed the company in the same way. Pfizer may be on its way toward stabilizing its business and winning back Wall Street's favor after the strong first quarter. But the company is struggling to balance that with the fears of its employees, some of whom said they feel uncertain about their future and unmotivated after the sudden reversal of fortune. In October Pfizer launched a multibillion-dollar cost-cutting program, slashing research and development spending and laying off hundreds of employees — including in the once-lauded Covid vaccine unit. In May the company said it's on track to deliver $4 billion in savings by the end of the year.

Stock Chart Icon Stock chart icon Pfizer's stock surged after it rolled out its Covid vaccine and antiviral treatment, then plunged when the company's Covid revenue started to drop.

Now, as Pfizer appears poised to turn a corner, the company is trying to boost employee morale to match Wall Street's optimism. CNBC spoke with 11 current and former Pfizer employees — all of whom asked to remain anonymous for fear of retaliation — about Pfizer's dizzying climb, rapid decline and turnaround strategy. The company's seesawing fortunes have fueled uncertainty within Pfizer's workforce. Most of the current and former employees CNBC spoke with called Pfizer a good place to work, and some current employees said they feel optimistic about the direction of the company after the first quarter. But other current employees are dissatisfied with where the strategy shift has left them. Some cited higher workloads after teams were stretched thin by budget cuts, a return-to-office policy they said has forced out some remote workers, and doubts about how the business will perform moving forward. The company's separate multiyear cost-cutting program announced in May is also stoking fears about the potential for new U.S. layoffs, according to some current workers. Some employees working in certain manufacturing and supply chain divisions, which they believe are likely to be affected by the cuts, described having low morale and motivation to work. Meanwhile, several former Pfizer employees, most of whom were laid off over the last six months or left voluntarily, said they're unhappy with how the company handled cost cuts in 2023. Some alleged that Pfizer management provided little transparency around the layoffs and seemed more focused on the company's stock performance than its staff throughout the process. During the latest town hall, Bourla told employees that layoffs in the U.S. have been completed but that more are occurring internationally. He called the job cuts ""very, very painful"" and said it was ""killing"" him to let employees go. But he also acknowledged that Wall Street likes the cuts. ""And, of course, I'm very concerned with everyone that could be affected and impacted by that, but it works,"" Bourla said, according to the recording. ""And we saw it, how the Street will respond."" A Pfizer spokesperson said reducing costs will ""put us on strong footing towards margin expansion and improved financial returns moving forward."" The spokesperson added that cutting expenses is one of Pfizer's five priorities for the year, along with maximizing the performance of new products, innovating its drug pipeline, growing its oncology business with its acquisition of cancer drugmaker Seagen, and allocating capital to increase its dividend, reduce outstanding debt and reinvest in the business. To cut costs, apart from layoffs the company is trimming its drug portfolio and direct marketing spending, shrinking its real estate footprint and reducing its investment in Covid, among other efforts, said the spokesperson. The spokesperson said Pfizer does not take the layoffs ""lightly"" and that the company is ""focused on providing our impacted colleagues with the resources and compassion they deserve.""

What went wrong in 2023

Pfizer entered 2023 on a high. The company had just capped a record-breaking 2022 with $100 billion in sales, more than half of which came from its Covid vaccines and Paxlovid. Employee morale at Pfizer was relatively high at the time, some current and former workers told CNBC. The company had gone on a hiring spree and piled money into different projects, they said. The success came with trade-offs. Two former employees involved in developing the Covid vaccine manufacturing process said they were experiencing burnout at the start of 2023. In January 2023, Pfizer forecast a steep drop in annual revenue, to between $67 billion and $71 billion. That outlook included $13.5 billion and $8 billion in sales of Covid vaccines and Paxlovid, respectively. But it could not predict at the time just how much revenue would dry up.

During an earnings call that same month, Pfizer executives said they expected roughly 24% of the U.S. population to get an annual Covid booster in 2023. But by December, only around 17% of U.S. adults had received the new Covid shots from Pfizer and Moderna, according to data from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Many Americans who got previous Covid shots felt they did not need more protection because the threat of the virus had diminished, according to recent surveys. Meanwhile, use of Paxlovid in the U.S. was dented by reductions in Covid testing and infection rates, and by doctors' concerns about interactions with common medications, among other factors. As demand plummeted, the federal government returned millions of the antiviral treatment courses to Pfizer. In January this year, however, Pfizer said fewer courses were returned by the end of 2023 than it had expected. The company soon acknowledged the challenges its Covid business faced towards the end of 2023. In October, Pfizer said it slashed both ends of its 2023 sales guidance by around $9 billion ""solely due to its Covid products."" At the same time, Pfizer started to cut costs. The company still hasn't said how many employees it laid off, though it reduced staff around the world. Pfizer's 2023 revenue ultimately came in at $58.5 billion, including $11.22 billion from its Covid vaccine and $1.28 billion from Paxlovid. The end of the year brought other challenges for Pfizer: The company scrapped the twice-daily version of its experimental weight loss drug, danuglipron, and saw slower uptake for a newly launched RSV vaccine in the U.S. than competitor GSK saw with its own version. After the string of difficulties, investors showed relief when Pfizer announced the cost cuts. But for many employees, the shift in post-pandemic strategy was a nightmare, they told CNBC. During a conference in January, Bourla acknowledged that 2023 was a rough year for the company and its stock price. But he said Pfizer took steps to start 2024 with a ""clean slate."" Those included renegotiating multibillion-dollar Covid contracts with the EU and other governments, transitioning its Covid products to the commercial market in several countries and writing off unused stock of its vaccine and Paxlovid. ""So it's not simple, how many people will use the vaccine. There were a lot of things we had to remove"" he said. Bourla also touted Pfizer's portfolio of new products that it said will boost sales, including nine new product approvals in the U.S. last year and a pipeline of drugs that could bring in more future revenue. Pfizer has also repeatedly said that the Seagen deal brings a proven antibody-drug conjugate platform that enhances its commercial structure and could help the company become a ""world-class oncology leader."" Pfizer has said Seagen could contribute more than $10 billion in risk-adjusted sales by 2030 with its targeted cancer therapies. Those revenue streams would help Pfizer prepare for upcoming patent expirations for blockbuster drugs, including its breast cancer treatment Ibrance, and Eliquis, a blood thinner it shares with Bristol Myers Squibb .

A 'slap in the face'

Some current and former employees said they knew early in 2023 that wide-scale layoffs were possible. Those people alleged that Pfizer has long had a culture of hiring too many people and later laying many employees off — a cycle seen at many other large companies. Pfizer wasn't the only Covid-boom company whose business declined. Biotech company Moderna 's revenue from its Covid shot also plunged in 2023. Companies outside the pharmaceutical industry that flourished in 2020, including fitness firm Peloton and digital meeting platform Zoom , also struggled to adjust as people returned to their pre-pandemic lives. Other drugmakers big and small are still downsizing and restructuring their workforces. Big pharmaceutical companies, such as Bristol Myers Squibb, are trying to conserve cash as they could lose revenue from upcoming drug patent expirations and Medicare drug price negotiations, among other threats. Biotech companies are also working to stay afloat after a rough 2023 marked by rising interest rates, a poor deal market and a lack of fundraising. At Pfizer, there were other warnings of trouble ahead, according to current and former employees: a small round of layoffs during the first quarter of 2023 and budget restrictions that limited travel, team lunch outings and purchases of new lab and manufacturing equipment. Pfizer's announcement in March 2023 that it would acquire Seagen for a whopping $43 billion was another sign, according to some current and former employees. While most of the 11 workers acknowledged that the deal made sense for Pfizer's growth, they said the hefty price tag at a time when Covid sales had already started to decline left them uneasy. Still, a few former employees said they felt blindsided by the company's decision to let go of staff, saying they were relatively optimistic about the business before the October cost-cut announcement. One former employee who worked at a site focused on gene therapies in Durham, North Carolina, said they were repeatedly told their job would be safe — even as Pfizer divested much of its early stage portfolio for those treatments at the start of 2023. The company confirmed with news outlets in October that it would close that site and lay off an undisclosed number of staff. Notably, Pfizer's layoffs also affected some workers involved in the research, development and manufacturing of the company's Covid vaccine, according to some current and former employees. They said those workers, whom Pfizer celebrated as pandemic heroes just a year earlier, felt especially betrayed by the cuts. ""It felt like we were tossed out the door when they no longer needed us,"" said one former employee who worked on the vaccine.

All the current and former employees who spoke with CNBC said they believed the company handled the layoffs and the months leading up to them poorly. Some workers said they were disappointed with what they called higher management's lack of transparency around the layoffs. Some also questioned why Pfizer did not set more realistic expectations for its Covid business earlier, especially as cases and public concern about the virus diminished in the U.S. On Oct. 17, just a few days after Pfizer publicly announced its cost-cutting program to investors, executives held a companywide town hall with Pfizer's more than 80,000-person workforce that one worker described as ""disastrous"" and another called a ""slap in the face."" On the town hall, Bourla and Pfizer Chief Human Experience Officer Payal Sahni Becher acknowledged the company's Covid business was struggling but said it was positioning for growth with the cost cuts, according to some current and former employees. Those people said the executives addressed the looming layoffs during the town hall but provided scant details on how many workers, teams or sites they would affect, when they would occur or how the company decided who would lose their jobs. Many workers also alleged that Bourla and Becher were too casual during the town hall, cracking light jokes and chuckling at some of the questions asked by staff, such as one about employee bonuses.

Return-to-office policies

On top of layoffs, return-to-office policies launched in 2023 forced out some workers in fully remote roles, some current and former employees said. Those people said some fully remote employees had their virtual work status revoked and were asked to start working in person at their site starting on a certain date under the new mandates. While some workers were asked to come in only two or three days a week, even that was impossible for staff members who lived too far from their sites, according to the employees. Some remote workers who did not comply over time were let go, the current and former employees said. A Pfizer spokesperson did not confirm or provide any details about its recent return-to-office policies. ""The return to office has been possibly the worst managed factor in all of this,"" one current employee said.

Those policies also applied to workers who were relocated from recently closed facilities, according to some employees. For example, Pfizer in October said it would shut down its office in Peapack, New Jersey in 2024, which affected nearly 800 workers. The company first announced those plans in 2021. Pfizer told news outlets that the majority of employees would be relocated to its headquarters in New York City. For one employee, a 15-minute commute to work became closer to an hour-and-a-half trip. During another town hall, on Oct. 26, Pfizer Chief Global Supply Officer Mike McDermott said the decision to close the Peapack site ""wasn't made lightly."" But he said having Peapack employees work in person at the company's headquarters was ""right for Pfizer's culture,"" according to a recording heard by CNBC. He said the company isn't taking away remote work as an option. Pfizer leadership has been vocal about asking employees to work in person again. ""Teleconferencing is simply no substitute for the personal interaction that makes it possible to share ideas, build connection, or even agree to disagree,"" Bourla said during the APEC CEO Summit in November. Pfizer is just one of several companies across different industries to push for in-person work again after the pandemic. Tech giants such as Google similarly reversed course on remote work in 2023 after offering flexibility to employees throughout Covid, reportedly frustrating workers.

Employee morale

Employee morale plummeted in the months after the October layoff announcement, according to current and former employees. Some of those people said they were unmotivated to work with their job security in question, while one worker described ""walking on eggshells"" for weeks out of fear that they would lose their job. Other employees said they were stretched thin due to understaffing and a lack of other resources. A few workers said they struggled to keep up with abrupt internal changes, such as being assigned to new managers or being moved onto different teams. Some current employees said Pfizer has held several so-called transparency meetings, which allow workers to anonymously ask questions and provide feedback to senior leadership. Faith in executive leadership also plunged among some workers, according to most of the current and former employees who spoke with CNBC. Some employees acknowledged that executives have a duty to care about their company's stock price but said that Bourla and other officials appeared to be hyper-focused on Pfizer shares even as people lost their jobs. Some current workers said that hasn't appeared to change after the town hall on May 2. Others said Bourla's remarks were encouraging and sounded far more genuine.

NASA and Boeing are further extending the first Starliner crewed flight but are not yet setting a new target date for returning the capsule to Earth, the organizations announced Friday.

Boeing's Starliner capsule ""Calypso"" will stay at the International Space Station into next month while the company and NASA conduct new testing back on the ground. Boeing's crew flight test represents the first time Starliner is carrying people, flying NASA astronauts Butch Wilmore and Suni Williams.

Officials say the Starliner team is starting a test campaign of the spacecraft's thruster technology at White Sands, New Mexico — testing that will be completed before Starliner returns to Earth.

""We think the testing could take a couple of weeks. We're trying to replicate the inflight conditions as best we can on the ground,"" NASA's Commercial Crew manager Steve Stich said during a press conference.

Before launching on June 5, Boeing and NASA planned for Starliner to be in space for nine days. As of Friday, the Starliner flight has tallied 24 days and counting.

Despite the extended stay at the ISS, officials emphasized that Starliner is safe to return at any point in case of an emergency. NASA and Boeing say the delay for testing is solely to gather more data about the spacecraft's performance, in particular its thruster system.

""I want to make it very clear that Butch and Suni are not stranded in space,"" Stich said.

The Starliner crew flight test represents a final major step before NASA certifies Boeing to fly crew on operational, six-month missions. Yet, similar to the previous two spaceflights that were uncrewed, Starliner is running into several problems during the mission.","Boeing's crew flight test represents the first time Starliner is carrying people, flying NASA astronauts Butch Wilmore and Suni Williams.

CNBC,https://www.cnbc.com/2024/06/28/ford-ceo-30000-ev-coming-in-two-and-a-half-years-at-a-profit.html,2024-06-28,21:30:54 UTC,"Ford CEO says a profitable $30,000 EV is coming in two and a half years","An electric Ford truck is displayed during the Electrify Expo D.C. in Washington, D.C., on July 23, 2023.

Ford Motor expects to introduce a $30,000 all-electric vehicle that will be profitable in roughly two and a half years, CEO Jim Farley said Friday during the Aspen Ideas Festival.

Farley did not release many other details about the vehicle, which is being developed by a Ford ""skunkworks"" team, but said its main competitors are expected to be Chinese automakers such as BYD and an anticipated entry-level car from U.S. EV leader Tesla .

Farley said Ford is first focusing on smaller EVs instead of larger all-electric trucks and SUVs, which have historically been gas-powered profit engines for the company, because such vehicles are ""never going to make money.""

""You have to make a radical change as an [automaker] to get to a profitable EV. The first thing we have to do is really put all of our capital toward smaller, more affordable EVs,"" Farley said during an interview with CNBC's Julia Boorstin. ""That's the duty cycle that we've now found that really matches. These big, huge, enormous EVs, they're never going to make money. The battery is $50,000. … The batteries will never be affordable.""

A Ford spokesman later clarified Farley was referring to large vehicles such as the company's Super Duty models or vehicles that require massive battery packs to achieve significant EV ranges of 500 miles. He was not referring to ones such as Ford's current all-electric F-150 Lightning pickup or next-generation EVs.

Ford earlier this year said it was postponing production of a large three-row SUV at a plant in Canada to 2027 from its initial plan of 2025. It also postponed a next-generation pickup, codenamed ""T3,"" from late 2025 to 2026.

Farley on Friday reiterated Ford's next-generation vehicles would be profitable.

He also said Americans need to ""get back in love"" with small cars instead of larger ones, a surprising statement given a majority or Ford's profits come from trucks and considering American carmakers have historically had trouble making money on small models.

""We have to start to get back in love with smaller vehicles. It's super important for our society and for EV adoption,"" Farley said Friday. ""We are just in love with these monster vehicles, and I love them too, but it's a major issue with weight.""

Ford's EV unit lost $1.32 billion during the first quarter of this year on 10,000 vehicles wholesaled. While the unit also includes EV-related business such as software, those losses equate to a loss of $132,000 per vehicle the unit sells.

Farley said it is crucial for Ford to make profitable EVs in the next five years as Chinese automakers continue to expand globally.

""If we cannot make money on EVs, we have competitors who have the largest market in the world, who already dominate globally, already setting up their supply chain around the world,"" he said. ""And if we don't make profitable EVs in the next five years, what is the future? We will just shrink into North America.""","Ford Motor expects to introduce a $30,000 all-electric vehicle that will be profitable in roughly two and a half years, CEO Jim Farley said Friday during the Aspen Ideas Festival.

CNBC,https://www.cnbc.com/2024/06/28/tractor-supply-ends-dei-pride-support-carbon-goals.html,2024-06-28,15:22:47 UTC,"Rural retailer Tractor Supply eliminates DEI roles, Pride support and carbon emissions goals","Shoppers are seen at the parking lot of a Tractor Supply Co. store near Bloomsburg.

Tractor Supply, a retail chain that sells home improvement equipment, livestock and agricultural supplies for farmers and pet owners, is eliminating diversity, equity and inclusion roles; withdrawing carbon emission goals; and walking back support for the LGBTQ community as part of sweeping changes to environmental, social and governance initiatives, the company announced this week.

The retailer said in a Thursday release that it will no longer submit data to the Human Rights Campaign, an LGBTQ advocacy group. The company will also stop sponsoring Pride festivals and voting campaigns, the release said. The company previously earned a perfect score on the Human Rights Campaign Foundation's 2022 Best Places to Work Corporate Equality Index.

The announcement comes in the final days of Pride Month.

Tractor Supply is also retiring initiatives aimed at reducing environmental impact and improving employee diversity. The company had set goals to achieve net zero carbon emissions in operations by 2040 and to reduce its water usage by 2025. Its DEI targets included boosting the number of employees of color at the manager level and above by 50% by 2026.

Tractor Supply said it's making the changes to better represent the values of the communities and customers it serves. The retailer caters to largely rural communities, with 50,000 employees across 2,250 stores in 49 states, according to company data.

""Rural communities are the backbone of our nation and what make America great,"" Tractor Supply said in the news release. ""We have heard from customers that we have disappointed them. We have taken this feedback to heart.""

Tractor Supply said it has invested millions of dollars in veteran causes, state fairs, animal shelters, rodeos and farmers markets and that it invests in the future of rural America by being the largest supporter of FFA, a nonprofit that promotes agricultural education for middle and high schoolers.

The retailer was previously included on Newsweek's list of America's Greatest Workplaces for Diversity in 2023 and was named to Bloomberg's Gender Equality Index for 2022 and 2023.

The publicly traded company has a market valuation of about $29 billion. CNBC contacted Tractor Supply for more details about the changes, and the company declined to comment beyond the release.

The changes come amid a growing wave of anti-DEI sentiment in the wake of a U.S. Supreme Court decision in 2023 to strike down affirmative action in colleges. Experts at the time predicted the ruling could have implications for corporate hiring or recruiting.

Companies, including Starbucks , Disney and Target , have faced legal challenges over DEI initiatives for LGBTQ customers and employees. In February 2023, pharmaceutical giant Pfizer dropped race-based eligibility requirements for a fellowship program designed for college students of Black, Latino and Native American descent, the Associated Press reported.","Shoppers are seen at the parking lot of a Tractor Supply Co. store near Bloomsburg.

CNBC,https://www.cnbc.com/2024/06/27/nike-nke-earnings-q4-2024.html,2024-06-28,15:11:44 UTC,"Nike shares plunge after retailer says quarterly sales will fall 10%, warns on China weakness","Nike shoes and logo are seen at a store in Nice, France on May 28, 2024.

Shares of Nike plunged on Friday after the retailer cut its full-year guidance and said it expects sales to drop 10% during its current quarter as it warned of soft sales in China and ""uneven"" consumer trends across the globe.

The expected 10% first-quarter slump is far below the 3.2% drop that analysts had expected, according to LSEG.

Nike shares plunged nearly 20% in trading Friday.

The sneaker giant, which reported quarterly earnings Thursday, now expects fiscal 2025 sales to be down mid-single digits, compared to analyst estimates of a 0.9% increase. Nike previously expected sales to grow. The company also expects sales in the first half to be down in the high single digits, compared to previous guidance of declines in the low single digits.

""A comeback at this scale takes time,"" the retailer's finance chief Matthew Friend said on a call with analysts Thursday. ""Although the next few quarters will be challenging, we are confident that we are repositioning Nike to be more competitive with a more balanced portfolio to drive sustainable, profitable, long-term growth.""

The company cut its guidance as it contends with slower online sales, planned declines in classic footwear franchises, ""increased macro uncertainty"" in the Greater China region and ""uneven consumer trends"" across Nike's markets, Friend said. It also expects sales into wholesalers to be slower as it scales new innovations and pulls back on classic franchises.

For the fiscal fourth quarter, the company handily beat earnings estimates as its cost-cutting efforts continue to bear fruit, but Nike fell short on revenue.

Here's how Nike did during the period compared with what Wall Street was anticipating, based on a survey of analysts by LSEG:

Earnings per share: $1.01 adjusted vs. 83 cents expected

$1.01 adjusted vs. 83 cents expected Revenue: $12.61 billion vs. $12.84 billion expected

The company's reported net income for the three-month period that ended May 31 was $1.5 billion, or 99 cents per share, compared with $1.03 billion, or 66 cents per share, a year earlier.

Sales dropped to $12.61 billion, down about 2% from $12.83 billion a year earlier.

In fiscal 2024, Nike posted sales of $51.36 billion, which is flat compared to the prior year. It's the slowest pace of annual sales growth the company has seen since 2010, excluding the Covid-19 pandemic.

Nike executives attributed the sales miss to a range of factors. They said its lifestyle business declined during the quarter and that momentum in its performance business, such as its basketball and running shoes, wasn't enough to offset it.

Online performance was soft because Nike had a higher share of lifestyle products, more promotions and fewer sales of classic franchises, such as its Air Force 1. It also saw traffic in China decline across all channels beginning in April due to macro conditions in the region.

Despite the traffic decline in China, sales in the region exceeded Wall Street expectations, according to StreetAccount, coming in at $1.86 billion, compared with estimates of $1.79 billion. It was the only geographical segment to top estimates for the period.

Sales in North America, its largest market, came in at $5.28 billion, below StreetAccount expectations of $5.45 billion.

In Europe, Middle East and Africa, Nike posted revenue of $3.29 billion, compared to estimates of $3.32 billion. In Asia Pacific and Latin America, Nike saw $1.71 billion in sales, compared to estimates of $1.77 billion.

Still, Friend later warned of the ""softer outlook"" in China and said had it not been for Chinese marketplace Tmall's early start to the region's 618 shopping holiday, sales in the country would've fallen short of Nike's internal expectations.

""The China marketplace remains highly promotional, and we continue to manage both Nike and partners' inventory carefully,"" said Friend. ""While our outlook for the near term has softened, we remain confident in Nike's competitive position in China in the long term.""

Nike's Converse brand was once again a significant underperformer in the overall results. The division saw revenue plunge 18% to $480 million, largely due to declines in North America and Western Europe.","Nike previously expected sales to grow.

CNBC,https://www.cnbc.com/2024/06/27/how-walmarts-sams-club-is-trying-to-take-on-costcos-kirkland.html,2024-06-27,12:10:56 UTC,How Walmart-owned Sam's Club is trying to take on Costco's private label Kirkland,"Stuck at home during the Covid pandemic, Megan Crozier needed a way to keep her two young children entertained. She bought an inflatable pool from Sam's Club.

The pool began leaking air after just a few uses.

For Crozier, chief merchant of the Walmart -owned membership club, that trashed pool — and the disappointment that came with it — helped kickstart a years-long effort to catch up with chief rival Costco and the popularity of its private brand, Kirkland Signature.

As Sam's Club opens more locations, it is trying to raise the bar for its own brand, Member's Mark. The label's makeover has become critical for Sam's Club as it aims to close the gap with Costco, which has roughly the same number of U.S. clubs but about twice as much annual revenue. Net sales for Sam's Club totaled $86.2 billion in its most recent fiscal year, compared with $176.63 billion for Costco's U.S. clubs.

Sam's Club CEO Chris Nicholas told CNBC the brand's revamp was inspired, in part, by the retailer's chief rival.

""The club model survives because you have brilliant merchants focusing on creating or buying exceptional items,"" he said in an interview. ""Costco did such a great job of that over the years with Kirkland and we saw that be successful.""

The success of Member's Mark will help determine how Sam's Club fares as its expands, with plans to open more than 30 stores over the next four years. At least some stores will be in regions where potential customers belong to a competing club like Costco or B.J.'s Wholesale , or in areas where customers may need convincing to pay an annual membership to be able to shop.

Overtaking Costco and its beloved private label won't be easy for Sam's Club, said Michael Baker, a retail analyst for D.A. Davidson.

""Never say never,"" he said. ""Who knows? But I think it's going to take a long time.""

But he added Costco's success with Kirkland Signature created a formula that Sam's Club can follow.

The popularity of Kirkland's brand, which includes a diverse range of items like vodka, batteries and dress shirts, has helped to drive membership sign-ups and renewals. It is one of the features that Costco highlights when the retailer's pitch to members.","As Sam's Club opens more locations, it is trying to raise the bar for its own brand, Member's Mark.

CNBC,https://www.cnbc.com/2024/06/27/goodrx-tracker-drug-prices-rise.html,2024-06-27,22:10:55 UTC,"Drug prices have risen almost 40% over the past decade, according to a new tracker","The cost of prescription medications in the U.S. has increased 37% since 2014, far surpassing the rate of inflation, according to data from drug savings company GoodRx .

Though the price increases have slowed this year in comparison to the past decade, the higher costs are raising out-of-pocket expenses for consumers. The average American spends $16.26 out of pocket per prescription, according to the data.

""When things increase … inevitably, they do trickle down to consumers, especially those who are in a high deductible plan or who don't have insurance or find themselves paying substantially out of pocket,"" said GoodRx director of research Tori Marsh.

GoodRx said the patients' share of the cost continues to grow due to rising copays, coinsurances and deductibles. The company found that over the past 10 years, the average person's deductible nearly doubled, and copays are rising as the majority of plans are adding another tier of drugs with higher copays.

It is a dynamic GoodRx deems ""the big pinch."" High medication costs are coupled with reduced insurance coverage. Analyzing coverage for more than 3,700 Medicare Part D plans between 2010 and 2024, GoodRx found that the portion of medications covered dropped 19% during that period.

""The impact is really kind of threefold,"" Marsh said. ""Rising costs or rising prices are a big part of it, but it's really that with the combination of increased friction. … It's hard for people to, in some ways, access their medication or access a pharmacy.

On average, Americans pay two to three times more for prescription drugs than consumers in other developed countries, according to the White House.

Drug costs have become a focus for President Joe Biden, particularly as he approaches the 2024 election. The Biden administration has taken several measures to lower out-of-pocket drug expenses.

On Wednesday, the White House announced it would lower prices on 64 prescription drugs for some Medicare beneficiaries as a result of inflation penalties on drugmakers.

The lower costs, effective during the third quarter, will benefit roughly 750,000 people who use the drugs annually, some of whom could save up to $4,593 per day, according to the release.

""Despite efforts by policymakers and industry leaders to break down affordability and accessibility barriers, a patient's actual out-of-pocket cost continues to increase and is often a huge surprise to them,"" said GoodRx interim CEO Scott Wagner in a news release.

Tesla is losing its lead over legacy automakers in the quality of its new all-electric vehicles, according to an annual influential study conducted by J.D. Power.

The 2024 U.S. Initial Quality Study found the quality of Tesla's battery-electric vehicles, or BEVs, and those of traditional carmakers were the same, at 266 problems reported per 100 newly sold or leased vehicles.

Previously, Tesla models had outperformed the electric vehicles of legacy automakers in the annual survey. Last year, the Tesla received a rank of 257 problems per 100 vehicles, compared with 265 problems per 100 vehicles on average for EVs from traditional automakers.

The study attributes Tesla's growing problems to a negative response from customers after the company removed traditional feature controls, such as turn signals and wiper stalks.

Across the broader industry, not just BEVs, Tesla has consistently ranked toward the bottom in initial quality since J.D. Power began including Tesla in the study in 2022.

Overall, the study, which included repair visits data of franchised dealers for the first time, found electric vehicles such as BEVs and plug-in hybrid electric vehicles (PHEVs), are plagued with more problems than traditional gas- and diesel-powered vehicles with internal combustion engines.

""Owners of cutting edge, tech-filled BEVs and PHEVs are experiencing problems that are of a severity level high enough for them to take their new vehicle into the dealership at a rate three times higher than that of gas-powered vehicle owners,"" J.D. Power's senior director of auto benchmarking, Frank Hanley, said in a news release.

The study found that plug-in vehicles require more repairs than gas-powered vehicles across all repair categories.

BEVs averaged 266 problems per 100 vehicles, 86 points higher than gas- and diesel-powered vehicles, which averaged 180 problems per 100 vehicles, according to the study. A lower score indicates higher vehicle quality.

Top concerns included features, controls and displays as well as wireless smartphone integration, as customers reported frequent difficulties with Apple CarPlay and Android Auto.

The study also reported frustration over false warnings, unnecessary traffic alerts and automatic braking features. Specifically, rear seat reminders contribute 1.7 problems per 100 vehicles across the industry, as owners report receiving signals even when no one is in the rear seat.

""It is not surprising that the introduction of new technology has challenged manufacturers to maintain vehicle quality,"" Hanley said.

2025 Rivian R1S Rivian

A Thursday investor event for Rivian Automotive that focused on cost-cutting efforts, efficiency gains and in-house technologies and software wasn't enough to build on the company's significant share growth this week. Shares of the all-electric vehicle startup fell by about 2% to 6% for much of the event, eating into some of its 23% gain in shares the day before on news of an up to $5 billion investment by Volkswagen Group . Rivian's stock closed Thursday down 1.8% to $14.47 per share, off by roughly 39% year to date amid investor concerns regarding cash burn and a slowdown in EV sales. Rivian on Thursday reconfirmed its 2024 guidance that included production of 57,000 vehicles and a path to positive gross profit during the fourth quarter, including regulatory credits. It also outlined longer-term growths, such as plans to achieve positive adjusted earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization in 2027. ""Everything that you're hearing from us, around our product, around how we're running the business, around how we're driving toward profitability, my hope is that you're seeing really an extreme sense of urgency,"" Rivian CEO RJ Scaringe said during the event. ""We're very, very fast driving towards the improvements necessary to get to positive free cash flow and, before that, positive margins this year.""

Rivian also outlined long-term financial targets of a roughly 25% gross margin, 10% free cash flow and adjusted profit margin in the ""high teens."" The company did not release a time frame for these targets. Scaringe spent much of his time during the roughly four-hour presentation discussing efficiencies in products and manufacturing, which he said are expected to lead to 20% material cost reductions in its current vehicles, followed by 45% targeted reductions in its upcoming ""R2"" vehicles, which are projected to begin production in early 2026. The reductions range from physical savings, such as a 54% decrease in design costs of its R2 vehicles compared with current models, to lower costs on more complex systems such as battery packs and electrical hardware. For example, the company is using 10 fewer in-house electronic control units, or ECUs, in its recently redesigned R1 vehicles, allowing it to remove 1.6 miles in wiring harness length and 44 pounds out of the vehicle. Rivian's software expertise is at the center of VW's plans to invest $5 billion in the automaker by 2026, including an anticipated joint venture between the companies to create electrical architecture and software technology. Volkswagen is expected to use Rivian's electrical architecture and software stack for vehicles beginning in the second half of the decade, Scaringe said during the investment announcement. He said the joint venture does not include anything with battery technologies, vehicle propulsion platforms, high voltage systems or autonomy and electrical hardware.

CNBC,https://www.cnbc.com/2024/06/27/walgreens-wba-earnings-q3-2024.html,2024-06-27,20:35:07 UTC,Walgreens stock plunges as drugstore chain slashes profit guidance in 'challenging' consumer environment,"Shares of Walgreens closed more than 20% lower on Thursday after the company reported fiscal third-quarter earnings that fell short of expectations and slashed its full-year adjusted profit outlook, citing a ""challenging"" environment for pharmacies and U.S. consumers.

The retail pharmacy giant now expects fiscal 2024 adjusted earnings of $2.80 to $2.95 per share. That compares with the company's previous outlook of between $3.20 and $3.35 per share.

""'We assumed ... in the second half that the consumer would get somewhat stronger"" but ""that is not the case,"" Walgreens CEO Tim Wentworth told CNBC.

He added that ""the consumer is absolutely stunned by the absolute prices of things, and the fact that some of them may not be inflating doesn't actually change their resistance to the current pricing. So we've had to get really keen, particularly in discretionary things.""

Still, Walgreens topped revenue estimates for the quarter on strong performance in its health-care segment. The company views that business division as critical to its ongoing push to transform from a major drugstore chain into a large health-care company.

The results come as Walgreens works to slash costs after a rocky last year marked by low pharmacy reimbursement rates, weakening demand for Covid products and a challenging macroeconomic environment.

The company on Friday said it is simplifying its U.S. health-care portfolio and finalizing plans to close underperforming U.S. stores over multiple years, among other ongoing cost-cutting efforts.

""Seventy-five percent of our stores drive 100% of our profitability today,"" Wentworth said. ""What that means is the others we take a hard look at, we are going to finalize a number that we will close.""

Here's what Walgreens reported for the three-month period ended May 31 compared with what Wall Street was expecting, based on a survey of analysts by LSEG:

Earnings per share: 63 cents adjusted vs. 68 cents expected

63 cents adjusted vs. 68 cents expected Revenue: $36.4 billion vs. $35.94 billion expected

Walgreens booked sales of $36.4 billion for the quarter, up 2.6% from the same period a year ago.

The company reported net income of $344 million, or 40 cents per share, for the quarter. That compares with net income of $118 million, or 14 cents per share, for the same period a year ago.

Excluding certain items, adjusted earnings were 63 cents per share for the quarter.

Walgreens did not provide a new revenue forecast for the fiscal year. The company has not offered that guidance since October, when it said it expected $141 billion to $145 billion in sales.","Shares of Walgreens closed more than 20% lower on Thursday after the company reported fiscal third-quarter earnings that fell short of expectations and slashed its full-year adjusted profit outlook, citing a ""challenging"" environment for pharmacies and U.S. consumers.

Chinese automakers are expected to continue rapidly expanding outside of their home country to achieve 33% of the global automotive market share by 2030, according to a new report released Thursday by prominent consulting firm AlixPartners. Much of the growth, from a forecast 21% market share this year, is expected to come outside of China. Sales outside of China are expected to grow from 3 million this year to 9 million by 2030, representing growth from 3% to 13% of market share by the end of this decade. The rapid expansion of Chinese automakers is a growing concern for legacy automakers and politicians globally. Many fear that the less-expensive, China-made vehicles will flood the markets, undercutting domestic-produced models, especially all-electric vehicles.

AlixPartners said it expects the Chinese brands to grow across all markets globally. However, the firm added that it expects far smaller expansion in Japan and North America, including the U.S., where vehicle safety standards are more stringent and a 100% tariff on imported Chinese EVs has been announced. ""China is the industry's new disruptor – capable of creating must-have vehicles that are faster to market, cheaper to buy, advanced on tech and design, and more efficient to build,"" Mark Wakefield, global co-leader of the automotive and industrial practice at AlixPartners, said in a statement. In North America, Chinese automakers are forecast to only achieve a 3% market share, largely in Mexico, where one in five vehicles are expected to be Chinese brands by 2030. In most other major regions of the world, AlixPartners reports that the share of Chinese automakers is expected to exponentially grow. Those areas include Central and South America, Southeast Asia and the Middle East and Africa. Chinese brands in China also are expected to grow from 59% to 72% in market share, according to AlixPartners. Legacy automakers such as General Motors have lost significant ground in China in recent years amid the rapid rise of China's domestic automotive industry and companies such as BYD , Geely and Nio .

Maxar Technologies | Via Reuters

NASA will have a spacecraft from Elon Musk's SpaceX guide the International Space Station's destruction later this decade, the agency announced Wednesday. The National Aeronautics and Space Administration awarded an $843 million contract to SpaceX to build the so-called ""U.S. Deorbit Vehicle."" The spacecraft will be designed to guide the football-field-sized research laboratory back into the Earth's atmosphere after retiring in 2030. The SpaceX-built vehicle will effectively destroy the ISS by pushing the station into reentry from orbit. ""It is crucial to prepare for the safe and responsible deorbit of the International Space Station in a controlled manner,"" NASA said in a press release, with the U.S. Deorbit Vehicle needed to ""ensure avoidance of risk to populated areas.""

NASA did not specify whether SpaceX's design for the U.S. Deorbit Vehicle will be based on one of the company's existing spacecraft, such as its Dragon capsules. SpaceX and NASA did not immediately respond to CNBC's request for comment on the design. Sign up here to receive weekly editions of CNBC's Investing in Space newsletter. The U.S. – along with four international partner agencies representing Russia, Europe, Canada, and Japan – has been preparing for the eventual end of the ISS, which has been crewed since 2000. The ISS, primarily created as a crewed research laboratory, has seen more than 3,300 experiments conducted in microgravity. That includes research not possible on Earth such as medical sciences and technology demonstrations.

Aging ISS

But the ISS is aging, with NASA and its lead partner Roscosmos, unable to solve a worsening problem of microscopic leaks on the station. NASA published a study on Wednesday with analysis of why it decided to intentionally destroy the ISS in a controlled reentry. The agency evaluated a variety of alternatives, including disassembling the station in orbit or trying to raise the ISS to a higher orbit with a large spacecraft like SpaceX's Starship. ""The space station is a unique artifact whose historical value cannot be overstated. NASA considered this when determining if any part of the station could be salvaged for historical preservation or technical analysis,"" the agency wrote. Ultimately, the agency study determined that any attempts to preserve or reuse the ISS were technically or economically infeasible. NASA noted the possibility the ISS' operational lifetime could be extended beyond 2030, but that is yet to be determined and requires agreement with its international partner agencies. NASA is planning to replace the ISS through private space stations and is helping fund U.S. companies' development through the Commercial LEO Destinations (CLD) program. The ISS totaled about $150 billion to develop and build and costs NASA about $4 billion each year to operate, so the agency sees privately built space stations as a way to replace the ISS at a fraction of the cost.","A satellite image shows an overview of the International Space Station with the Boeing Starliner spacecraft, June 7, 2024.

CNBC,https://www.cnbc.com/2024/06/26/levi-levi-earnings-q2-2024.html,2024-06-27,09:17:32 UTC,Levi's shares drop 15% as jeans maker's sales disappoint despite denim craze,"Denim is having a moment with consumers, but it hasn't led to a major sales boost at Levi Strauss .

The jeans creator on Wednesday posted fiscal second-quarter revenue that fell just short of Wall Street's expectations at a time when shoppers are stocking their wardrobes with denim dresses, skirts and ultra low-rise baggy pants.

Levi's posted better-than-expected earnings as its direct sales to consumers and cost cutting continue to bear fruit. The company raised its dividend by 8% to 13 cents per share, its first increase in six quarters.

Still, shares fell about 15% in extended trading.

Here's how Levi's performed during the quarter compared with what Wall Street was anticipating, based on a survey of analysts by LSEG:

Earnings per share: 16 cents adjusted vs. 11 cents expected

16 cents adjusted vs. 11 cents expected Revenue: $1.44 billion vs. $1.45 billion expected

The company's reported net income for the three-month period that ended May 26 was $18 million, or 4 cents per share, compared with a loss of $1.6 million, or zero cents a share, a year earlier. Excluding one-time items, Levi's posted earnings of $66 million, or 16 cents per share.

Sales rose to $1.44 billion, up about 8% from $1.34 billion a year earlier. However, the sales jump was coming off of an easier comparison.

In the year-ago period, sales were down 9% after Levi's shifted its wholesale shipments from its fiscal second quarter into its fiscal first quarter. The shift reduced sales last year by about $100 million, the company said previously. Excluding the shift, as well as the exit of Levi's Denizen business, sales would have been up by only about 1% in its most recent quarter compared to the year-ago period.

Finance chief Harmit Singh attributed the sales miss to unfavorable foreign exchange conditions and weak sales at Docker's. During the quarter, the khaki and chinos brand saw $82.4 million in sales, up 8.6% from $75.8 million in the year ago period. It's not clear how sales at Docker's were affected by the timing of Levi's wholesale orders.

""People are generally cautious,"" Singh told CNBC in an interview. ""It's not necessarily an environment where people are buying a lot, people are cautious.""

While Levi's posted a strong earnings beat, it only reaffirmed its full-year guidance, which was in line with estimates. The company continues to expect full-year earnings per share to be between $1.17 and $1.27, which now includes a 5-cent hit coming from the company's new distribution and logistics strategy.

Levi's said it is transitioning from a primarily owned-and-operated distribution and logistics network in the U.S. and Europe to one that relies more on third parties.

""In the near term, these changes require the parallel operation of new and old facilities for the rest of 2024, resulting in a transitory increase in distribution costs,"" the company said.

The change allows Levi's to shift the responsibility of final mile delivery to third parties. The denim maker noted that it has new terms with its supplier that result in Levi's taking ownership of inventory closer to the point of shipment rather than its eventual destination. Levi's distribution network was built for a business that primarily sold to wholesalers, and now it needs to change into one that's more focused on selling directly to consumers.

The changes are necessary because nearly half of Levi's sales these days are coming from its own website and stores.

Direct-to-consumer sales jumped 8% during the quarter, representing 47% of overall sales. Online sales increased 19%.

""Our transformational pivot to operating as a DTC-first company is yielding positive results around the world, giving me great confidence that we will achieve accelerated, profitable growth for the rest of the year and beyond,"" CEO Michelle Gass said in a statement.

During the quarter, wholesale revenue grew 7%, but excluding the shift in timing of wholesale orders, sales in the channel decreased 4%. Singh noted that wholesale revenue improved on a sequential basis, but the company has a ""conservative"" view of the channel's growth moving forward.

By building out its own direct channels, Levi's enjoys higher profits, better data on its consumers and less reliance on shaky wholesalers like Macy's and Kohl's, which are continuing to shrink and fall out of favor with consumers.

However, selling directly can also be more expensive, and can come with unexpected hiccups that can impact sales and drain profits. For example, when someone buys a pair of Levi's from Macy's and wants to return them, Macy's typically bears that cost. Under a direct model, that responsibility, including the cost and logistics, would fall on Levi's.

Nike has come to be known as a cautionary tale for retailers long reliant on wholesalers that try to expand direct sales.

For a while, Nike's focus on direct sales boosted revenue and profits, but some critics said the strategy shift led to a slowdown in innovation, and ultimately, market share losses.

Recently, the company acknowledged that it erred when it cut off so many of its wholesale partners and said it has since ""corrected"" that.

It's been almost 20 years since the founding of Alphabet's YouTube, and Hollywood still doesn't really know what to do with it. YouTube, which effectively invented user-generated content, claims a daunting share of overall media consumption. And it's no longer just dominating the internet, it's dominating the living room, too. YouTube made up 9.7% of all viewership on connected and traditional TVs in the U.S. in May — the largest share of TV for a streaming platform ever reported by Nielsen's monthly ""The Gauge"" report. Netflix ranked second, claiming 7.6% of viewership. Among streamers only, YouTube's total viewership was close to 25% market share. ""We're not talking about your mobile phone, your laptop, that I'm sure you see your kids using all the time, but on the biggest screen in the house, the TV,"" said LightShed media analyst Rich Greenfield. ""Every [media] executive has to be paying attention."" But media companies such as Netflix, Disney and Warner Bros. Discovery aren't sure whether YouTube is friend or foe. Some media executives see YouTube as a companion platform to subscription streaming services and cable TV — an unwieldy behemoth of non-narrative, creator-led content with a social media slant that doesn't really fit the New York-Hollywood nexus of professional media. Others — even at times the same executives — view YouTube as an existential threat to the entertainment industry, stealing viewership from subscription streaming services and, with it, the cultural center of American youth. Those competing truths have led media and entertainment companies to concoct a wide array of strategies to combat the growing threat. Disney leaders discuss YouTube ""every day"" in strategic meetings and have considered adding user-generated content to Disney+, though it's not on the immediate roadmap, according to people familiar with the matter, who asked not to be named because the discussions are private. Netflix and Warner Bros. Discovery, on the other hand, have consciously chosen to focus on the other 90% of the TV viewing world that isn't YouTube. ""I do think it snuck up on people that YouTube was as important a presence in people's lives and people's viewing experiences not just on the phone but in the living room,"" said Tara Walpert Levy, YouTube's vice president of Americas, in an interview. ""When Nielsen first noted that YouTube was winning the streaming wars in terms of viewing, full stop, not just for ad-supported platforms, I had a ton of my friends from advertising, from media, who were like, 'Can you believe it?' It exceeded even our expectations,"" she said.

YouTube's growing dominance

Earlier this year, YouTube Chief Executive Officer Neal Mohan announced that users watch more than 1 billion hours of YouTube content on TV screens each day. More than 150 million Americans watch YouTube on connected TVs each month, according to the company. Ad dollars have followed. In 2023, YouTube took in $31.5 billion in advertising revenue, up 8% from 2022 and 271% from six years ago. In the first quarter of 2024, YouTube's ad revenue climbed 21% from a year earlier to $8.1 billion. YouTube, founded in 2005, sold to Google for $1.65 billion a year later. It's since ballooned in size as advertisers flocked to the platform. MoffettNathanson media analyst Michael Nathanson estimated in March that YouTube would be worth a whopping $400 billion as a standalone company — more than Disney and Comcast combined. ""YouTube is still the 800-pound gorilla in this space, and I do believe they're a pretty unstoppable juggernaut,"" said Candle Media co-CEO Kevin Mayer, who previously ran Disney's streaming business and was briefly CEO of TikTok.

Disney's YouTube focus

Disney executives are particularly attuned to YouTube's rising dominance, given its grip on younger people, according to people familiar with the company's thinking. Disney has a legion of super-fans who flock to YouTube and other social media sites to promote and critique its parks, rides and merchandise, movies and TV shows. Integrating some of that content as shoulder programming to Disney's scripted series and movies could help keep users on Disney+. A Disney spokesperson declined to comment on conversations about adding original content to the platform. The company claims 11.4% of TV viewership, according to Nielsen's ""The Gauge"" report, when adding up cable and streaming, including Hulu and ESPN.

You're betraying your audience. You're leaving YouTube to act, and then you're not posting online anymore, and you're asking them to wait on a project that's in development for what? A year, two years? People are going to forget about you, girl. That's how the internet works."" Brittany Broski YouTube creator

""I think what we're seeing from all of these traditional media companies is they don't have enough content, and it's too expensive to produce the types of premium content at scale that they need. And so maybe the [user-generated content] economy is a place they look ... not to create their competitor, but as a lower cost way to add content to their services,"" said LightShed's Greenfield. Disney is also considering putting more full episodes of Disney+ and Hulu series geared to older kids and adults directly on YouTube to entice an audience that isn't currently subscribing to its streaming platforms, said a person familiar with the matter. This is a strategy Disney has done with kids content for years, helping amplify hit animated series such as ""Bluey,"" ""Spidey and his Amazing Friends"" and ""Mickey Mouse Clubhouse.""

""At the end of the day, Disney is a storytelling machine,"" said Mayer. ""We used short-form video on YouTube as a promotional device for our content. But I don't think that we at Disney, nor have any other traditional media companies, leaned into YouTube as an original storytelling device the way they probably should have."" According to internal research, Disney executives concluded that younger Americans use YouTube as an online encyclopedia, said one of the people familiar with the company's discussions. That's led the company to focus on the benefits of the platform's discovery functionality while also programming against it, the person said. Disney has made bespoke YouTube content for its new preschool series ""Disney Junior's Ariel,"" which debuts June 27, to introduce the mermaid character to kids. It has also developed a series of ""Winnie the Pooh"" shorts so that it can research how the animated bear and his friends resonate with today's youth. The company is now considering making a full-length animated series on ""Winnie the Pooh"" based on the short-form video data, the person said.

Netflix's muted response

Netflix is taking on YouTube from a different angle. It doesn't view the platform as the same singular threat to viewership that some of its peers do. Netflix famously considers everything that could occupy a user's time, even sleep, as a long-term competitor. For the time being, Netflix executives consider YouTube as catering to a different consumer need. ""We have built a hard-to-replicate combination of a strong slate, superior recommendations, broad reach and intense fandom, which drives healthy engagement on Netflix. Improvement in these key areas is the best way to delight our members and continue to grow our business,"" Netflix said in its most recent quarterly shareholder letter. Netflix has even found some success duplicating content on YouTube in specific instances. ""Cocomelon,"" the animated toddler-geared short-form video series owned by Candle Media's Moonbug Entertainment, has become massively popular on both YouTube and Netflix. ""Cocomelon"" has 175 million subscribers to its English language YouTube channel, and ""many more if you add in all languages,"" Mayer said. At the same time, ""Cocomelon"" frequently tops Netflix's most-watched list among kids shows.

The more immediate YouTube threat for Netflix comes from an advertising perspective. Netflix is now going head-to-head with YouTube for marketing dollars after introducing its ad-supported tier in November 2022. Netflix said in May that it has 40 million global monthly active users for its advertising tier. That's a far cry from YouTube's more than 2 billion monthly active users. Netflix is even contemplating launching free versions of its service in certain international markets to court advertisers, though there's nothing concrete planned, Bloomberg reported earlier this week. Netflix declined to comment for this story.

Other strategies

Comcast -owned NBCUniversal has experimented with new ways to copy the rabbit-hole effect of YouTube Shorts, which force-feed users content based on interest, by offering curated clips of ""Saturday Night Live"" sketches, scenes from ""The Office"" or favorite Bravo show moments. If younger users are being conditioned to watch in a certain way, NBCUniversal's Peacock streaming service wants to give consumers that choice in addition to its long-form movies and TV shows. But simply curating feeds within a content vertical now feels like a ""YouTube 1.0 strategy"" given how TikTok, YouTube Shorts and Instagram Reels have redefined short-form viewing, according to Nathanson. ""I don't think, at this point, there's a strategy in place among any of the traditional media players to create content for the YouTube generation that's more than just their branded strategy they're doing now,"" said Nathanson. ""The future strategy is to use AI to deliver personalization for each of us. Today, none of the traditional media players has that. That's YouTube 2.0."" Amazon is trying a more direct plan of attack — pay YouTube's biggest star to make a show for their own service. The company announced a deal earlier this year with MrBeast, whose real name is Jimmy Donaldson, to make a reality TV show, ""Beast Games,"" that will pay the winner $5 million in cash. The format will largely borrow from previous MrBeast giveaway videos that pit many contestants against each other for cash, using a ""fast-paced and high-production format,"" as Amazon has promised.

MrBeast's YouTube channel has the most subscribers worldwide at 289 million and expects to take in a whopping $700 million in revenue in 2024, primarily through advertising and brand deals. But while MrBeast may have crossover appeal, there's skepticism among creators that YouTube celebrities will have success making shows for subscription streaming services. Moreover, the entire Hollywood system may operate too slowly for a younger generation that demands immediate content.

YouTube's community

The popularity of YouTube stems from the authentic relationship creators have with their fans, according to Brittany Broski, 27, whose YouTube channel has more than 2 million subscribers. ""I still watch Netflix and HBO, where if I want a good fantasy series or whatever, I know where to go for that. But what YouTube is more concerned with is in this digital age, we've lost a sense of community and a sense of third spaces where we can go to hang out and meet new friends,"" Broski said. Broski's audience, which she described as Generation Z and young millennial women and members of the LGBTQ+ community, ballooned during the pandemic. Stuck at home with limited social options, hundreds of thousands of people found Broski as they searched for fresh, real-time content. That personal relationship is YouTube's secret sauce, and it doesn't translate when creators port to other services, Broski said. ""You're betraying your audience,"" said Broski. ""You're leaving YouTube to act, and then you're not posting online anymore, and you're asking them to wait on a project that's in development for what? A year, two years? People are going to forget about you, girl. That's how the internet works.""

The business model of YouTube for successful creators incentivizes staying on the platform. YouTube has shared more than $70 billion with its creators over the last three years through its Partner Program, which shares advertising revenue with more than 3 million channels on the platform. ""Why would I create a show and sell it to a network when I could just put it on YouTube?"" Broski said. ""You're self-funding, but if the money you're making from AdSense is going right back into your content to make more money, why do you even have to contact that third party?"" YouTube also benefits from a low barrier to entry to create content and from instant feedback through comments from fans that often help shape future content immediately. That model can't be replicated in a scripted form, where full seasons of TV shows are premade and rolled out on specific schedules. ""In the traditional industry, it's about proving to other people that the content deserves to be made, deserves to be seen, deserves a marketing campaign, deserves dollars behind it,"" said YouTube star and former professional cyclist Michelle Khare, 31, whose channel has more than 4.5 million subscribers. ""With YouTube, if you have the drive, the ability, and in many cases, your phone, you can skip those steps and put it out into a democratic platform where the audience ultimately decides what rises to the top.""

Southwest expects revenue per available seat mile, the amount the airline brings in for every seat it flies one mile, will fall between 4% and 4.5% in the second quarter over last year, after previously estimating a 1.5% to 3.5% decline.

It also said its unit expenses, excluding fuel, would be up as much as 7.5% over the year-earlier period and that capacity would still rise as much as 9% in that period, both unchanged from its previous forecast.

Southwest still expects record quarterly operating revenue in the second quarter.

Airlines are raking in record numbers of passengers but higher costs and growth in capacity have weighed on fares and profits.

CNBC,https://www.cnbc.com/2024/06/26/biden-to-lower-some-drug-costs-through-inflation-penalties.html,2024-06-26,13:24:06 UTC,Biden administration to lower costs for 64 drugs through inflation penalties on drugmakers,"US President Joe Biden speaks during an event at the National Institutes of Health (NIH) in Bethesda, Maryland, US, on Thursday, Dec. 14 2023.

The Biden administration on Wednesday said it will impose inflation penalties on 64 prescription drugs for the third quarter of this year, lowering costs for certain older Americans enrolled in Medicare.

President Joe Biden has made lowering U.S. drug prices a key pillar of his health-care agenda and reelection platform for 2024. A provision of Biden's Inflation Reduction Act requires drugmakers to pay rebates to Medicare, the federal health program for Americans over age 65, if they hike the price of a medication faster than the rate of inflation.

It is separate from another provision under the law that allows Medicare to negotiate lower prescription drug prices with manufacturers. On average, Americans pay two to three times more than patients in other developed nations for prescription drugs, according to the Biden administration.

Some patients will pay a lower coinsurance rate for the 64 drugs covered under Wednesday's announcement, which fall under Medicare Part B, for the period from July 1 to Sept. 30 ""since each drug company raised prices faster than the rate of inflation,"" according to a release from the administration.

Some Medicare Part B patients may save as much as $4,593 per day if they use those drugs during the quarter, the release added.

More than 750,000 Medicare patients use the drugs each year, according to the release. The medications treat conditions such as cancer, certain infections and a bone disease called osteoporosis.

The list includes Bristol Myers Squibb's Abecma, a cell therapy for multiple myeloma; and Pfizer's targeted cancer treatment for certain lymphomas called Adectris. It also includes Astellas Pharma and Pfizer's Padcev, a targeted cancer treatment for advanced bladder cancer.

The Biden administration said Padcev's price has increased faster than inflation every quarter since the Medicare inflation rebate program went into effect last year.","The Biden administration on Wednesday said it will impose inflation penalties on 64 prescription drugs for the third quarter of this year, lowering costs for certain older Americans enrolled in Medicare.

Delta Air Lines is the country's most profitable airline. CEO Ed Bastian's challenge is to make sure his carrier stays on top. The airline's unit revenue, the amount it brings in for every seat it flies one mile, outpaced its competitors' last year. Delta's share price has soared more than 17% in 2024, one of the strongest performers in the rocky airline sector, in a rally that's outdone the S&P 500 's. It expects free cash flow to rise as much as 50% this year to between $3 billion and $4 billion, and is eyeing a return to an investment-grade credit rating. And a stat any traveler would appreciate: Delta came in first in punctuality last year, with more than 83% of its flights arriving on time, according to the Transportation Department. Rival United Airlines — second to Delta in net profit margins — is circling. It says it could grow profit even more this year. ""Knowing that there's someone that thinks that they can take that mantle from us, that keeps us on our toes and keeps us continuing to drive hard,"" Bastian told CNBC.

Delta has fashioned itself as America's premium airline. It has won over hordes of splurging travelers, many of them carrying American Express cards, Delta's cash cow of a partner that generated almost $7 billion for the airline last year. Sales growth of Delta's roomier and more expensive seats continues to outpace revenue from standard coach. As they vie for luxury flyers, both Delta and United have added more high-end seating to their planes to cater to travelers who deem worthwhile a $300 surcharge for a few inches of extra legroom on a cross-country round trip, or 10 times as much for a seat in business class. Bastian, a former auditor who said he took his first flight at age 25 for a business trip (New York to Chicago), is in charge of ensuring Delta lives up to its brand luster. On Wednesday, Delta took its next shot in the battle for high-spending flyers when it opened its newest, highest tier of airport lounge at New York's John F. Kennedy International Airport for passengers in its Delta One cabin, its top cabin that features lie-flat beds for longer flights. At more than 39,000 square feet it is Delta's largest lounge, accented with pillows that have the iconic zigzag motif of Italian fashion house Missoni, its new amenity kit partner. It features complimentary spa treatments, like ice globes and serum for jet-lagged eyes, along with showers, a full restaurant, and a deck overlooking the airfield, in a bet that travelers' desire to treat themselves is here to stay. Delta is taking a page from the playbooks of United and American , which already dedicate their swankiest lounges to customers flying in long-haul business class. Delta plans to open Delta One lounges in Boston and Los Angeles later this year, and is studying airports where it could open others. ""The thing with this industry is no good idea goes uncopied,"" said Raymond James airline analyst Savanthi Syth. Meanwhile, United is placing huge orders for new Boeing and Airbus planes and remodeling hundreds of narrow-body cabins that feature seatback screens and Bluetooth technology, a strategy that aims to cater to travelers from international business class to those flying on the cheapest basic economy tickets. ""We haven't exactly achieved the No. 1 profitability status in the industry, but I know we're on our way,"" United's chief commercial officer, Andrew Nocella, said in an interview last month. ""If we continue to invest in our customers through great service and great products and great network, we know that will feed upon itself and it'll help us achieve the financial results that we're looking for."" Delta, United and American are approaching their 100th birthdays, and are trying to stay ahead — if not drive — shifting travel demand and still turn a profit. United is adding to the more than 300 airports it serves. Figuring out the next hot destination is ""part art"" and ""part science,"" said Patrick Quayle, its head of network planning. The airline's sprawling global network makes United the biggest U.S. airline by capacity and it recently launched service to places like Dubrovnik, Croatia, and Amman, Jordan. Quayle pointed to United's addition of Cape Town, South Africa, which it first announced before the pandemic, as a success. ""Another airline has subsequently copied us. ... I might want to add based in Atlanta,"" he said, alluding to Delta's home city. The latest changes come at a difficult time for a lot of U.S. airlines. Labor and other costs swelled after the pandemic, eating into margins despite record numbers of travelers. Added capacity in the U.S. market has forced carriers to discount fares in off-peak travel periods. It's tricky, and expensive, to change course. Even Southwest Airlines is facing investor pressure to add things like premium seating or seat assignments as its simple, but long successful, business model shows signs of age.

Meanwhile, U.S. consumers are growing more selective: Some corporate leaders have lamented a spending pullback while others, like Delta's CEO, are saying the opposite. Americans are still digging into the so-called experiences economy, and paying for more comfort along the way, according to Bastian. ""They may not be buying that new EV or that new house, but they're saying we're going to go out and experience the world and invest in that experience,"" he said. ""And that's why you see it happening in high-end concerts, high-end hospitality.""

'Brick by brick'

When the U.S. was careening toward recession almost two decades ago, Delta's leaders made a correct bet that travelers would eventually pay more to fly on its jets. Delta was emerging from Chapter 11 bankruptcy in 2007, which other U.S. carriers found themselves in the years after the Sept. 11, 2001, terrorist attacks. Former CEO Richard Anderson said the airline had to start with basics: stop losing bags. Make sure flights didn't get canceled and arrived on time. Clean up the cabins. ""It was about building the operation brick by brick,"" said Anderson, who handed the reins to Delta's former president, Bastian, in 2016. ""It didn't matter what you did with AmEx. If the flight canceled, you ruined your brand."" Delta took better care to avoid maintenance problems. It also started ferrying planes to airports to avoid cancellations if a replacement aircraft was needed. And the carrier tried to clean up its image, hiring a marketing firm that advised former President Barack Obama's 2008 presidential campaign.

Anderson said the airline needed to be consistent and not fly its mix of paint jobs and cabin interiors. It faced fresh competition from low-cost airlines like a then-spritely upstart out of Queens, New York, called JetBlue Airways . Delta and United had both launched their own low-cost subsidiaries, but they discontinued them. Delta executives knew they needed a brand to match if they were going to command a premium over competitors. ""One of the things about being a premium product is consistency, consistency in policy, consistency in appearance,"" said Anderson. ""If you got on a flight in Tokyo we wanted you to feel like you were home."" After the string of changes, Delta's performance improved. Corporate business travel contracts helped boost profits and still do, as business travel returns post-pandemic. Delta had a key advantage over competitors. After it came out of bankruptcy, it merged with Northwest Airlines in 2008, allowing it to stabilize and expand around the world while other carriers floundered. The rest of the industry spent much of the next decade recovering from bankruptcies and a subsequent musical chairs of mergers that left four big carriers in control of about three-quarters of the U.S. domestic market. Delta's rivals were years behind the carrier on integrating their merged staff, operations, networks and fleets. Bastian said Delta's focus on reliability has made life easier for not just its customers, but also its employees. ""They're not having to explain for a cancellation or mishandled luggage,"" he said. ""They have time to serve rather than to apologize."" Delta is also unique as the least unionized of the major U.S. airlines, at about 20%. In April, as campaigns were underway to organize its flight attendants and other workers, it again raised worker pay. Flight attendants for Delta's regional carrier, Endeavor, which are unionized, have recently demanded compensation on par with the carrier's mainline flight attendants.

Time to remodel

After Delta got the basics down, Bastian, 67, who joined Delta in 1998, said it was time for the airline to focus on more ambitious projects. ""You had the liberty to start investing in premium,"" he said. ""You started to figure out how to make first class more available to customers."" It has expanded in big-spending New York and Los Angeles, the country's two largest air travel markets by revenue, according to aviation data firm OAG. Delta also built up its host of global alliances, joint ventures and minority ownership stakes, giving it more reach. That includes its 49% stake in Virgin Atlantic, which already had a strong foothold in premium air travel and popular lounges. ""I think some of that heritage has made its way into the core of Delta,"" said Virgin Atlantic's CEO, Shai Weiss. ""I'm not suggesting we are the messiah for Delta, but there is no surprise that Delta and Virgin Atlantic see eye to eye on many things."" The vast majority of the more than 940 million people who flew on U.S. airlines last year fly in coach, and Delta has tried to make its flights more desirable to travelers on all sections of the plane. It remodeled old and dated terminals, and built out its network of luxury airport lounges, which are tied to its lucrative credit card deal with American Express. It added seatback televisions and better in-flight entertainment options, and in February 2023, it announced its long-awaited free Wi-Fi to customers enrolled in its SkyMiles frequent flyer program.

Delta has invested more than $12 billion to rebuild and update its U.S. hubs with soaring ceilings, new technology and in some lounges, a signature scent. (""It's proprietary,"" said Claude Roussel, who oversees Delta's lounges, when asked what was in it.) One of its latest efforts is its terminal and new Sky Club at New York's LaGuardia Airport, alongside other airlines' new terminals. A decade ago, then-Vice President Joe Biden famously said someone who was blindfolded and taken to that airport would think, ""I must be in some third-world country."" The airline faced big problems along the way like a dayslong system outage in 2016. And the worst of all: Covid-19. Like other airlines, Delta accepted billions in federal aid to weather the pandemic. The carrier successfully urged some 17,000 workers to take buyouts, hiring newer, lower-paid staff who lacked the experience of departed employees. Early in the process, Bastian said the newer workers gave the company a ""juniority benefit."" The airline employed about 100,000 people in the U.S. as of the end of last year. Delta and its competitors also pulled out of many small cities as the pandemic eased, isolating some smaller cities amid a shortage of regional jet pilots. But international travel has proved resilient so far, as consumers show they are willing to shell out on experiences.

Luxury air travel? In the U.S.?

Luxury air travel and the United States didn't go together for many years — and might not still, if you ask well-heeled globetrotters. U.S. airlines don't offer on-board showers or roomy suites like those on the superjumbos flown by the likes of Etihad Airways or Singapore Airlines. But the U.S. air travel market, the world's largest, has gotten a number of upgrades in recent years, and travelers have grown to expect the same convenience they get from their online shopping sites and ride-hailing and food-ordering apps. ""Delta's not bougie by any stretch, but when your competitors don't try very hard, it doesn't take much,"" said Henry Harteveldt, a former airline executive and founder of Atmosphere Research Group. But as a rewards credit card boom, strong consumer spending, social media envy and a wanderlust that predated the pandemic combined to boost demand, airlines executives were taking notice. Delta's sales from premium products are growing faster than revenue from its main coach cabin, a trend the airline forecasts will continue. Sales from Delta's loyalty business, premium cabins and other streams comprise more than half of the carrier's revenue. Airlines have made big changes as they struggle to accommodate the swelling numbers of big-spending travelers armed with elite status. Major carriers have all overhauled their frequent flyer programs to reward the biggest spenders instead of those who fly the most miles, and made it harder to earn coveted elite status. And at Delta and other airlines, many of the perks for luxury flyers come through lounges. One of Delta's Sky Clubs at Los Angeles International Airport offers a separate, dedicated security checkpoint for customers flying Delta One, away from the masses at the airport. That feature will make it to the new JFK lounge later this year, a Delta spokesman said. United and American Airlines have also worked to glam up and expand their airport lounges, access to which is a common perk with credit cards. Delta softened some restrictions on Sky Club lounge access last year — which it made to end annoying and unsightly long lines to enter its exclusive airport real estate — after an uproar from customers.

'We're constantly pushing each other""

Both Delta and United have issued sunny financial forecasts for this year, while many carriers are losing money or not pulling in similar profit margins. ""Watching [Delta] succeed, I became convinced that the product mattered and service mattered, and we have done that at United now,"" United CEO Scott Kirby said at a JPMorgan industry conference in March. And at an investor conference last month, he pointed to how the two are pulling away from the rest of the pack in profitability, particularly at big hubs. United has made some big bets that paid off. It held onto its wide-body planes, when travel demand collapsed in the pandemic, and has benefited from the surge in international travel. With United on Delta's tail, Bastian is trying to expand the airline's reach. Bastian has attended the massive Consumer Electronics Show in Las Vegas and has announced new partnerships with Lyft and Starbucks for its loyalty program.

CNBC,https://www.cnbc.com/2024/06/27/hm-plunges-12point5percent-on-doubts-over-full-year-margin-target-june-sales-outlook.html,2024-06-27,08:02:15 UTC,"H&M plunges 13% on doubts over full-year margin target, June sales outlook","Shares of H&M plunged more than 14% on Thursday morning after the company reported a smaller-than-expected increase in second-quarter profits and cast doubt over its June sales and full-year profit margin target.

The stock pared losses slightly to trade down 13% by 9:00 a.m. London time.

The world's second largest retailer said operating profit for the period between March and May came in at 7.1 billion Swedish kroner ($672 million), below the 7.37 billion Swedish kroner anticipated by analysts, according to an LSEG poll cited by Reuters.

The second-quarter result was nevertheless above the 4.7 billion Swedish kroner recorded in the same period last year.

The company also said that bad weather was likely to dampen sales in June, which it expects to decline by 6% in local currencies, compared with the same period of last year.

Further weighing on stock, H&M CEO Daniel Ervér cast doubt over the company's ability to meet its margin target this year.

""Our goal of an operating margin of 10 percent for full-year 2024 remains in place,"" he said. ""However, the conditions for achieving that level this year have become more challenging as it is assessed that external factors that influence our purchasing costs and sales revenues, including materials and foreign currency, will have a more negative impact than we expected in the second half of the year.""

He added that the company was continuing to invest in both its online and in store experiences, with upgrades to stores in Paris, Milan, Berlin, Stockholm, Hamburg and Munich to follow those already undertaken in New York, London and Tokyo.

It comes as higher living costs and a slowdown in post-pandemic spending have weighed on both high street and luxury retail sales.

Earlier this month, Zara owner Inditex reported a slowdown in first-quarter sales compared to the previous year's growth, but pointed to an uptick in May.

CNBC,https://www.cnbc.com/2024/06/26/micron-shares-slide-after-revenue-forecast-fails-to-top-estimates.html,2024-06-26,22:51:00 UTC,Micron shares slide after revenue forecast fails to top estimates,"Sanjay Mehrotra, Micron Technology President & CEO at the WEF in Davos, Switzerland on May 24th, 2022.

Micron shares fell about 7% in extended trading on Wednesday as investors looked past better-than-expected results and focused instead on a revenue forecast that was in line with estimates.

Here's how the company did versus LSEG consensus estimates for the fiscal third quarter ended May 30:

Earnings per share : 62 cents adjusted vs. 51 cents expected

: 62 cents adjusted vs. 51 cents expected Revenue: $6.81 billion vs. $6.67 billion expected

Micron, which makes computer memory and storage, said it expects adjusted earnings per share of $1.08 on revenue of $7.6 billion in the current quarter. Analysts were expecting earnings per share of $1.05 on revenue of $7.6 billion.

The shares have more than doubled in the past year as the company rides the artificial intelligence boom. Micron's most advanced memory is needed for AI graphics processing units (GPUs) like Nvidia's , putting the company in position to benefit from demand for technology to train and deploy AI applications like OpenAI's ChatGPT.

Micron reported $332 million in net income, or 30 cents per share, versus a net loss of $1.9 billion, or $1.73 per share, in the year-ago quarter.

Micron CEO Sanjay Mehrotra highlighted the company's AI business in a statement while saying that its smartphone and PC markets remain sluggish.

Mehrotra said the company's AI-oriented products were likely to increase in price and that the company's data center business grew 50% on a quarter-to-quarter basis.

""Robust AI-driven demand for data center products is causing tightness on our leading-edge nodes,"" Mehrotra said in a statement. ""Consequently, we expect continued price increases throughout calendar 2024 despite only steady near-term demand in PCs and smartphones.""

On a call with analysts, Micron said that its high bandwidth memory, the kind used in AI chips, is sold out through 2025.

""We believe that Micron will be one of the biggest beneficiaries in the semiconductor industry in the multiyear growth opportunity driven by AI,"" Mehrotra said.

CNBC,https://www.cnbc.com/2024/06/25/fedex-fdx-earnings-q4-2024.html,2024-06-25,22:54:46 UTC,FedEx shares jump after hours as massive cost-cutting measures kick in,"FedEx shares soared more than 15% after hours Tuesday after the company reported results that topped analysts' estimates in both earnings and revenue.

Here's how the company did in its fiscal fourth quarter compared with what Wall Street was anticipating, based on a survey of analysts by LSEG:

Earnings per share : $5.41 adjusted vs. $5.35 expected

: $5.41 adjusted vs. $5.35 expected Revenue: $22.11 billion vs. $22.07 billion expected

The company reported net income for the three-month period that ended May 31 of $1.47 billion, or $5.94 per share, compared with $1.54 billion, or $6.05 per share, a year earlier.

Revenue rose to $22.1 billion, up slightly from $21.9 billion a year earlier. For the full fiscal year, revenue was $87.7 billion, down from $90.2 billion.

FedEx reported that capital spending for fiscal 2024 was $5.2 billion, down 16% from $6.2 billion in fiscal 2023 and less than the $5.7 billion it forecasted in its fiscal 2024 guidance last year.

For fiscal 2025, the company said it expects low to mid-single-digit revenue growth year over year, driven in large part by e-commerce and low-inventory levels, FedEx Chief Customer Officer Brie Carere said on the company's earnings call.

""We think e-commerce is going to outpace the B2B growth,"" Carere said. ""We like the fundamentals from an e-commerce perspective that will help us here in the United States and around the world.""

The capital spending decline comes as the company amps up its cost-cutting measures as part of a sweeping commitment to cut $4 billion by the end of fiscal 2025.

Following weak freight demand, FedEx enacted its DRIVE transformation program to cut costs and consolidate the business.

""DRIVE continues to change the way we work at FedEx. We achieved our target of $1.8 billion in structural costs out in fiscal year '24,"" CEO Raj Subramaniam said on the call.

Subramaniam said the company is firmly on track to achieve the $4 billion cost-cutting goal and further expects another $2 billion from the company's plans to consolidate its air and ground services.

As part of the DRIVE initiative, FedEx announced in April 2023 that it will be consolidating its delivery companies Express, Ground, Services and others into a unified Federal Express Corporation, operating under the FedEx brand and alongside the company's Freight segment which will continue to exist separately. The company said at the time that it expects the combined delivery business to handle all deliveries starting June 2024.

The newly combined segments are expected to be the larger driver of fiscal year 2025 adjusted income and margin improvement, finance chief John Dietrich said on the call.

FedEx further expects the demand environment to moderately improve through the next fiscal year, according to Carere.

Investor's eyes are also on the company's largest segment Express, which has been struggling with margin growth the past year. The segment's margins ended the fourth quarter at 4.1%, unchanged year over year. Its operating margin for fiscal 2024 was 2.6%, up slightly from 2.5% last year.

Subramaniam said improving performance of the Express segment is a ""top priority"" for the company.

While the company hiked its quarterly dividend by 10% earlier this month, investors do foresee headwinds, particularly after the company lost its U.S. Postal Service contract to rival United Parcel Service n April.

UPS will become the primary air cargo provider for USPS starting Sept. 30, after FedEx's contract expires. USPS was the largest customer for the company's Express segment. The company shared that it expects a $500 million headwind from the loss in fiscal 2025.","FedEx shares soared more than 15% after hours Tuesday after the company reported results that topped analysts' estimates in both earnings and revenue.

In a lyric on her latest album, Beyoncé sings ""denim on denim, on denim, on denim."" Levi Strauss shoppers are taking that advice to heart. Levi Strauss executives are ecstatic. Western wear is booming as consumers opt for top-to-bottom denim looks, the iconic, 171-year-old clothing maker said on Wednesday. As the style wins cultural favor, its popularity is juicing denim niches — like shirts, skirts and dresses — that fall outside Levi's widely-known blue jean offerings. ""The growing popularity of Western wear is at an all-time high,"" CEO Michelle Gass told analysts Wednesday night after the California-based retailer's latest earnings report for the quarter ended in May. A Western renaissance has been gaining traction over the past several months, sending stylish shoppers searching for pieces like jeans, boots and cowboy hats. Levi's scored a huge hit when its jean brand was referenced in Beyoncé's song ""Levii's Jeans,"" released earlier this year. Beyond Beyoncé's chart-topping ""Cowboy Carter"" album, the increased ubiquity of Western style has also been tied to a fashion line unveiled by Louis Vuitton earlier this year and Taylor Swift's ongoing Eras Tour.

Gass, who took over as Levi Strauss CEO earlier this year after previously serving as the CEO at Kohl's , has touted that denim is having a moment in the popular imagination, with Western wear trending more broadly throughout the culture. More specific data shared on the company's earnings call Wednesday showed how Levi Strauss is taking advantage of demand for denim beyond its popular ""501"" jeans. Sales of denim skirts, jumpsuits and dresses all at least doubled in the latest quarter, Gass said. Western shirts sales are also up significantly, she said, especially on the women's side. Levi is find success in what the 55-year-old chief executive described as a new strategy of trying to dress customers denim — from head-to-toe. ""Our new focus is, yes, continuing to own jeans, but taking that denim top to bottom,"" Gass said on CNBC's ""Mad Money"" late Wednesday. While noting that the denim skirt and dress categories haven't been historically large for the company, now ""they're exploding,"" she said.

Denim rage sets a high bar on Wall Street

To be sure, the well-documented denim craze alone isn't necessarily impressing Wall Street. Levi Strauss tumbled more than 15% on Thursday in response to its latest numbers, its second worst day since going public in early 2019. Levi Strauss posted $1.44 billion in revenue in the fiscal second quarter, slightly missing the $1.45 billion consensus forecast of analysts polled by LSEG despite the denim boom. The company's finance chief told CNBC that the sales miss was driven by unfavorable foreign exchange rates and weakness in the Dockers brand. On the other hand, Levi Strauss earned 16 cents per share, excluding items, ahead of the 11-cent average estimate by analysts. In the year through Wednesday, shares had run up amid the buzz around the cotton-based fabric and the resurgence of Western clothing. Following Thursday's drop, the stock is still up more than 18% on the year. For comparison, shares of Kontoor Brands , the parent of denim brands Wrangler and Lee, have risen 5% year to date.

CNBC,https://www.cnbc.com/2024/06/28/may-pce-inflation-report.html,2024-06-28,19:35:23 UTC,"Key Fed measure shows inflation rose 2.6% in May from a year ago, as expected","Including food and energy, headline inflation was flat on the month and also up 2.6% on an annual basis. Those readings also were in line with expectations.

Both numbers were in line with the Dow Jones estimates. May marked the lowest annual rate since March 2021, which was the first time in this economic cycle that inflation topped the Fed's 2% target.

The core personal consumption expenditures price index increased just a seasonally adjusted 0.1% for the month and was up 2.6% from a year ago, the latter number down 0.2 percentage point from the April level, according to a Commerce Department report .

An important economic measure for the Federal Reserve showed Friday that inflation during May slowed to its lowest annual rate in more than three years.

""It is just additional news that monetary policy is working, inflation is gradually cooling,"" San Francisco Fed President Mary Daly told CNBC's Andrew Ross Sorkin during a ""Squawk Box"" interview. ""That's a relief for businesses and households who've been struggling with persistently high inflation. It's good news for how policy is working.""

The Fed focuses on the PCE inflation reading as opposed to the more widely followed consumer price index from the Labor Department's Bureau of Labor Statistics. PCE is a broader inflation measure and accounts for changes in consumer behavior, such as substituting their purchases when prices rise.

While the central bank officially follows headline PCE, officials generally stress the core reading as a better gauge of longer-term inflation trends.

Outside of the inflation numbers, the Bureau of Economic Analysis report showed that personal income rose 0.5% on the month, stronger than the 0.4% estimate. Consumer spending, however, increased 0.2%, weaker than the 0.3% forecast.

Prices were held in check during the month by a 0.4% decline for goods and a 2.1% slide in energy, which offset a 0.2% increase in services and a 0.1% gain for food.

However, housing prices continued to rise, up 0.4% on the month for the fourth straight time. Shelter-related costs have proven stickier than Federal Reserve officials have anticipated and have helped keep the central bank from reducing interest rates as expected this year.

Stock market futures were modestly positive following the report while Treasury yields were negative on the session.

Investors have been trying to handicap the Fed's intentions on rates this year and have had to scale back expectations. Whereas traders earlier in 2024 had been expecting at least six rate cuts this year they are now pricing in just two, starting in September. Fed officials at their June meeting penciled in just one reduction this year.

""The lack of surprise in today's PCE number is a relief and will be welcomed by the Fed,"" said Seema Shah, chief global strategist at Principal Asset Management. ""However, the policy path is not yet certain. A further deceleration in inflation, ideally coupled with additional evidence of labor market softening, will be necessary to pave the way for a first rate cut in September.""

The Fed targets 2% inflation and began raising interest rates in March 2022 after a year of dismissing rising prices as transitory effects from the Covid pandemic that likely would fade. The central bank last raised rates in July 2023 after taking its benchmark overnight borrowing level to a range of 5.25%-5.50%, the highest in some 23 years.

Recent economic data has painted a picture of an economy that has withstood the Fed's aggressive monetary tightening. Gross domestic product rose at a 1.4% annualized rate in the first quarter and is on pace to increase 2.2% in the second quarter, according to the Atlanta Fed.

There have been some slight cracks in the labor market lately, with continuing jobless claims hitting their highest level since November 2021. However, the unemployment rate is still 4%, low by historical means though also rising at a slow pace.","Including food and energy, headline inflation was flat on the month and also up 2.6% on an annual basis.

CNBC,https://www.cnbc.com/2024/06/27/theres-a-big-fed-inflation-reading-coming-friday-heres-what-to-expect.html,2024-06-28,10:56:54 UTC,There's a big Fed inflation reading coming Friday. Here's what to expect,"People purchase beverages in a store on a sweltering afternoon in Brooklyn, New York, on the first day of summer on June 21, 2024.

The official Dow Jones forecasts for Friday's numbers are for the headline, or all-item, PCE price reading to come in flat on the month, while core is projected to rise 0.1%. That would compare to respective increases of 0.3% and 0.2% in April . Both headline and core are forecast at 2.6% on a year-over-year basis.

If that date rings a bell, it's when core PCE first passed the Fed's coveted 2% inflation target during this cycle. Despite a series of aggressive interest rate increases since then, the central bank has yet to wrest the pace of price increases back into its target range.

But even more importantly, when stripping out volatile food and energy prices, the core PCE price index, which draws even closer scrutiny from Fed policymakers, is set to indicate its lowest annual reading since March 2021.

The personal consumption expenditures price index, an inflation measure the Federal Reserve watches closely, is expected to show little, if any, monthly increase for May, the first time that would be the case since November 2023.

There could be some pretty good inflation news on the way from the Commerce Department when it releases a key economic report Friday.

Should the core PCE price forecasts transpire, it will serve as a milestone of sorts.

""We are in line with [the forecast] that the PCE core pricing data will come in soft,"" said Beth Ann Bovino, chief economist at U.S. Bank. ""That's good news for the Fed. It's also good for people's pocketbooks, although I don't know if people feel it just yet.""

Indeed, while the rate of inflation has receded precipitously from its mid-2022 peak, prices have not. Since that March 2021 benchmark, core PCE is up 14%.

That steep climb and its pernicious effect is why Fed officials are not ready to declare victory yet, despite the obvious progress made since the rate hikes began in March 2022.

""Returning inflation sustainably to our 2% target is an ongoing process and not a fait accompli,"" Fed Governor Lisa Cook said earlier this week.

Cook and her colleagues have been circumspect about the timing and pace of rate cuts, though most agree that easing is likely at some point this year as long as the data stays in line. Futures markets are currently pricing in a good likelihood that the Fed will enact its first quarter-percentage-point cut in September, with another to follow by the end of the year. Policymakers at their meeting earlier this month penciled in just one cut.

""We do expect softening in the real economy — not falling off a cliff, just softening — that suggests that inflation will be softer as well later on. That gives us reason to expect the Fed will be able to likely have their first cut in September,"" Bovino said.

""Now we all know it depends on the data and the Fed is still watching,"" she added. ""Could they wait? Could it just be a one and done this year? I can't rule it out. But it does look like the numbers might give the Fed cover to cut rates two times this year.""

In addition to the inflation numbers, the Commerce Department at 8:30 a.m. ET will release figures on personal income and consumer spending, with estimates at a rise of 0.4% and 0.3%, respectively.","If that date rings a bell, it's when core PCE first passed the Fed's coveted 2% inflation target during this cycle.

The annual survey conducted by the China General Chamber of Commerce in the U.S. found that nearly 60% of companies aim to maintain a stable level of investment and that about 30% plan to boost it.

""A notable degree of long-term optimism persisted, with the majority expressing positive future revenue expectations,"" CGCC said, adding that the survey reflected ""a commendable sense of optimism, determination, and resilience.""

The survey was conducted in April and May of this year, polling nearly 100 Chinese companies across various industries about performance and outlook.

The report said Chinese firms remain committed to the U.S. market despite growing negative sentiment about the overall business environment amid rising trade tensions between the world's two largest economies.

Over 60% of survey respondents saw a deteriorating business environment in the U.S. Meanwhile, the rate of concern regarding a ""stalemate in Sino-US bilateral relations political and cultural relations"" surged to 93% from 81% a year prior.

Over the past year, the Biden administration has ramped up curbs on Chinese businesses, scrutinizing certain China-dominated industries, placing new sanctions on various Chinese firms and goods and trying to outright block Chinese ownership of certain companies and platforms.","A recent survey of Chinese enterprises in the U.S. has found that a majority remain bullish on the market long term despite growing concerns about U.S.-China relations and the broader business environment.

CNBC,https://www.cnbc.com/2024/06/25/fed-governor-bowman-says-shes-still-open-to-raising-rates-if-inflation-doesnt-improve.html,2024-06-25,16:07:05 UTC,Fed Governor Bowman says she's still open to raising rates if inflation doesn't improve,"Michelle Bowman, governor of the US Federal Reserve, speaks during the Exchequer Club meeting in Washington, DC, US, on Wednesday, Feb. 21, 2024.

Federal Reserve Governor Michelle Bowman said Tuesday the time is not right yet to start lowering interest rates, adding she would be open to raising if inflation doesn't pull back.

""Should the incoming data indicate that inflation is moving sustainably toward our 2 percent goal, it will eventually become appropriate to gradually lower the federal funds rate to prevent monetary policy from becoming overly restrictive,"" Bowman said in prepared remarks for a speech in London. ""However, we are still not yet at the point where it is appropriate to lower the policy rate.""

Those comments reflect a prevailing sentiment at the central bank, in which most policymakers have said in recent weeks that, while they still expect inflation to get back to the Fed's 2% target, they need more evidence.

Recent readings have shown moderating inflation, with the Fed's preferred indicator running just under 3%. However, the rate-setting Federal Open Market Committee noted after its last meeting that there has been only ""modest further progress.""

Bowman noted that there are ""a number of upside risks"" prevailing that could accelerate her outlook, which is among the most hawkish of all policymakers.

""I remain willing to raise the target range for the federal funds rate at a future meeting should progress on inflation stall or even reverse,"" she said. ""Given the risks and uncertainties regarding my economic outlook, I will remain cautious in my approach to considering future changes in the stance of policy.""

The Commerce Department on Friday will release its reading on the May personal consumption expenditures price index, the Fed's preferred inflation gauge. Economists surveyed by Dow Jones expect a 12-month inflation rate of 2.6% on both the all-items and core, which excludes food and energy prices.

While that would represent a nudge lower from April, Bowman said she still expects the Fed to hold its key overnight borrowing rate in a range between 5.25%-5.50% ""for some time.""

Moreover, she indicated she is not being swayed by rate reductions from the Fed's global counterparts such as the European Central Bank, which recently lowered its key rates by a quarter percentage point. Bowman said ""it is possible over the coming months that the path of monetary policy in the U.S. will diverge from that of other advanced economies.""

In other Fed news Tuesday, Governor Lisa Cook expressed optimism that inflation would show more significant progress in 2025, allowing the Fed to lower rates at some point.

""With significant progress on inflation and the labor market cooling gradually, at some point it will be appropriate to reduce the level of policy restriction to maintain a healthy balance in the economy,"" Cook told the Economic Club of New York.

While Cook said she is optimistic that inflation will head lower and supply and demand in the labor market is coming into better balance, she also noted that risk factors remain. They include higher credit card delinquency rates and tighter credit conditions, along with the difficulty in assessing economic data that has come under continuous and significant revision.

Both officials' remarks follow other policymakers saying Monday that they're hesitant to cut.

San Francisco Fed President Mary Daly rejected the idea of doing a preemptive cut to hedge against deterioration in the labor market and a slowing economy.

""I do think that preemptive cutting is something that you do when you see risks,"" Daly told CNBC's Deirdre Bosa during a public event in San Francisco. ""We're going to be resolute until we finish the job. That's why not taking preemptive action when it's not necessary is so important.""

Also, Chicago Fed President Austan Goolsbee told CNBC's Steve Liesman earlier on Monday that if he sees ""more months"" of good inflation data, then he would question whether policy needs to be as restrictive as it has been, paving the way for cuts.

As governors, Cook and Bowman are permanent FOMC voters. Daly also gets a vote this year while Goolsbee does not, though he does get a voice at meetings and submits his forecast to the committee's

CNBC,https://www.cnbc.com/2024/06/30/top-wall-street-analysts-favor-these-dividend-stocks-for-better-returns.html,2024-06-30,10:55:21 UTC,Top Wall Street analysts favor these dividend stocks for better returns,"A sign is posted in front of an Olive Garden restaurant on June 20, 2024 in Rohnert Park, California.

Dividend-paying stocks can help investors bolster their portfolios and boost returns.

Investors searching for these names will need to find companies that have a track record of making steady payments, backed by robust financials.

Here are three attractive dividend stocks, according to Wall Street's top pros on TipRanks, a platform that ranks analysts based on their past performance.

Darden Restaurants

The first dividend stock is Darden Restaurants (DRI), which operates several popular brands in full-service dining, including Olive Garden, LongHorn Steakhouse and Yard House. The company recently announced mixed results for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2024. While Darden exceeded analysts' earnings expectations, its sales slightly missed the Street's consensus amid increased discounting by rivals.

Darden issued $628 million in dividends and committed $454 million to share repurchases in fiscal 2024. Moreover, the company announced a dividend hike of nearly 7%, bringing the quarterly dividend to $1.40 per share. The stock has a dividend yield of 3.5%.

Following the results, BTIG analyst Peter Saleh reiterated a buy rating on DRI stock with a price target of $175. The analyst highlighted that at the mid-point, Darden's earnings per share outlook of $9.40 to $9.60 indicates double-digit total shareholder return, which is in line with the company's long-term targets.

Saleh thinks that the company can achieve its targeted return metrics, supported by several factors, including a modest rise in pricing, advertising initiatives and easing inflation.

""We view Darden Restaurants as one of the strongest operators in the industry with historical sales and restaurant margin performance that has consistently exceeded peers,"" said Saleh.

Saleh ranks No. 360 among more than 8,900 analysts tracked by TipRanks. His ratings have been successful 61% of the time, with each delivering an average return of 11.7%. (See Darden's Financial Statements on TipRanks)

International Seaways

Next up is International Seaways (INSW), a tanker company that offers energy transportation services for crude oil and petroleum products. On June 26, the company paid a combined dividend of $1.75 per share. The company's combined dividend represented 60% of its first-quarter adjusted net income.

In its first-quarter results, INSW highlighted that its combined dividend payments of $5.74 per share over the last twelve months reflected a dividend yield of more than 13%.

Following meetings with INSW's management, Stifel analyst Benjamin Nolan reaffirmed a buy rating on the stock and increased the price target to $68 from $66. The analyst noted that the tanker market remains cyclically strong due to a continued increase in global oil consumption, the limited supply of new ships and the longer average voyage lengths caused by the ongoing geopolitical troubles.

Accordingly, Nolan increased his rate assumptions for 2024 and 2025. The analyst expects International Seaways to continue to deliver higher cash flows, fueled by a favorable backdrop for the tanker market.

Nolan expects INSW to sustain high supplemental dividends, given the estimated $200 million to $300 million of excess cash flow after capital expenditure (assuming there is no new debt associated with tanker acquisitions). ""We are modeling $5.51/share in 2024 dividends, although there is room to be a little higher,"" said the analyst.

Nolan ranks No. 68 among more than 8,900 analysts tracked by TipRanks. His ratings have been successful 67% of the time, with each delivering an average return of 19.5%. (See International Seaways' Stock Charts on TipRanks)

Citigroup

Finally, let's discuss this week's third dividend stock, banking giant Citigroup (C). At a quarterly dividend of 53 cents per share, Citigroup offers a yield of 3.3%.

The bank held its Services Investor Day on June 18. Management expressed confidence about achieving the 2024 guidance, driven by revenue growth across all the core businesses despite macro uncertainty and the possibility of lower interest rates.

Following the event, Goldman Sachs analyst Richard Ramsden reiterated a buy rating on Citigroup stock and slightly raised his price target to $72 from $71. The higher price target reflects an increase in the analyst's EPS estimates for 2024, 2025 and 2026 based on management's commentary, which indicated that the bank's strategic transformation plan is gaining momentum.

Ramsden noted that Citi is highly focused on its transformation efforts, with the bank making steady progress on risk control and data quality. Coming to the Services business, the analyst noted that management established strategic priorities for this vital component of the company's financial targets. The analyst estimates that the Services business will account for 25% of the group revenue growth through 2026.

""The Services business is well positioned to maintain their market leading positions with potential to continue share gains across businesses,"" said Ramsden. The analyst's optimism is based on Citi's extensive global network in 95 countries, well-established long-term client relationships, and market share gains that are expected to be driven by investments in technology and innovative offerings.

Ramsden ranks No. 969 among more than 8,900 analysts tracked by TipRanks. His ratings have been successful 65% of the time, with each delivering an average return of 11.9%.

CNBC,https://www.cnbc.com/2024/06/29/two-paths-for-jana-to-bolster-shareholder-value-at-rapid7.html,2024-06-29,11:55:40 UTC,Activist Jana has a stake in Rapid7. There are two paths to bolster value at the cybersecurity company,"Business: Rapid7 is a global cybersecurity software and services provider. Its products span across information security, cloud operations, development and information technology teams, enabling them to understand attackers and leverage that information to take control of their fragmented attack surface. Rapid7 Managed Threat Complete is the company's flagship offering, and it includes the Rapid7 Managed Detection and Response program. Rapid7 also provides risk and threat coverage through InsightIDR and Insight VM services, making them available in a single package. Its security solutions help more than 11,000 global customers unite cloud risk management and threat detection.

Activist Commentary: Jana is a very experienced activist investor founded in 2001 by Barry Rosenstein. The firm made its name taking deeply researched activist positions with well-conceived plans for long term value. Rosenstein called his activist strategy ""V cubed."" The three ""Vs"" were"" (i) Value: buying at the right price; (ii) Votes: knowing whether you have the votes before commencing a proxy fight; and (iii) Variety of ways to win: having more than one strategy to enhance value and exit an investment. Since 2008, the firm has gradually shifted that strategy to one which we characterize as the three ""Ss"" (i) Stock price: buying at the right price; (ii) Strategic activism: sale of company or spinoff of a business; and (iii) Star advisors/nominees: aligning with top industry executives to advise them and take board seats if necessary.

Rapid7 is a cybersecurity company that expands the expertise of its clients' security operations. Its Managed Threat Complete flagship offering combines end-to-end 24/7 managed detection and response with vulnerability management offerings. Historically, the company has focused on on-site cybersecurity operations, but it has begun to expand into the explosive growth area of cloud security. Rapid7 operates in a highly attractive industry and is the beneficiary of some meaningful tailwinds. In a time where software budgets are being cut or reallocated toward AI, the threat of cyberattacks looms large and presents a great enough risk that spend is either flat or increasing for these types of services. In addition, cybersecurity analysts and internal security staff are limited, so there is a tremendous need for outsourcing. With more complex operations and numerous applications both on-site and in the cloud, Rapid7 is well-positioned to continue growing and aims to be a high-quality provider for subject matter experts who may not be able to retain the services of their largest and most expensive competitors.

Despite its favorable position, the company has delivered negative returns on a one-, three-, and five-year basis. Rapid7 is one of three main players in vulnerability management, yet it's assigned a much smaller revenue multiple (3x) compared to peers Tenable (5.5x) and Qualys (8x). One factor in this is that Rapid7 offers a combination of low- and high-growth cybersecurity offerings, which is difficult to value, but more important are the multiple slip-ups by management, exacerbated by a lack of oversight by the board. First, the company has undergone changes to its sales model, including a shift to selling packaged products from selling offerings individually. It's also moved to a channel model from direct. Next, the company has encountered challenges in bringing its cloud product to market. In addition, to shift from pure growth to a profitable software company, Rapid7 has focused on meeting targets for $160 million in free cash flow and improved margins. In August 2023, likely in pursuit of these goals, the company abruptly announced plans to reduce its staff by 18%. Rapid7 has had further retention problems in key executive roles, including the departure of its chief innovation officer and its critically important chief operating officer and president. Finally, the company has not been able to properly make forecasts, leading to tremendous investor uncertainty and questions of board oversight. In February 2024, the company announced its 2024 guidance, which it stated it was highly confident in, only to cut it in May when the company delivered its Q1 results. That led to a 17% stock price decline on May 8. This is a company operating in a highly complex and dynamic space – it is doing everything all at once and has seemingly failed to deliver.

With a company like this, there are generally two paths to shareholder value creation: (i) a long-term plan involving board reconstitution, management overhaul and review of strategic and operational plans and (ii) a shorter-term plan to sell the company to an interested buyer who can make those changes. With respect to the long-term plan, Jana generally works with industry executives and consultants in performing due diligence and implementing its activist plans, and we do not expect this situation to be different. The firm will often bring these individuals to the table to serve as director nominees, if deemed necessary. Jana is experienced in getting these experts on company boards, where they often serve as assets in getting the company to correct its issues, from operational to governance to capital allocation. But Jana also has extensive experience in strategic activism and getting portfolio companies sold. We expect that Jana will advocate for the strategy it expects will maximize shareholder value on a risk- and time-adjusted basis. Given the problems the company has been experiencing and the lack of CEO focus (Aside from being chairman and CEO of Rapid7, Corey Thomas is on the National Security Telecommunications Advisory Committee, chair of the Federal Reserve Bank of Boston and a member of the Council on Foreign Relations. He also serves on the boards of the Blue Cross Blue Shield of Massachusetts, LPL Financial and Vanderbilt University.), a sale looks like it could be the easier and more certain path if there is a suitor at the right price.

Given industry tailwinds, there may be several strategic and financial buyers interested in this company. Recent transactions in the cybersecurity sector include Cisco's $28 billion takeover of Splunk and Francisco Partners' $1.7 billion acquisition of Sumo Logic. If Jana does advocate for a sale of Rapid7, it will ask the board to do it through a full sales process that attains the highest value for shareholders. In addition, Jana has a strategic partnership with Cannae Holdings, which could be helpful in providing the equity in a strategic transaction with a private equity firm. Consider that in 2019, Cannae joined with private-equity firms to buy Dun & Bradstreet. It is important to note that even if Jana thinks a sale of the company is the best way to optimize shareholder value, the firm will still have to get the board to agree. This does not look like a board and management team that will just go quietly. In such a case, Jana's remedy would be to launch a proxy fight, but that could take some time. The 2024 annual meeting just passed on June 13 and the director nomination window does not open until Feb.13, 2025.

JERUSALEM, Israel – After President Joe Biden's shocking debate performance Thursday, Israelis are alarmed, as are many other allies. They worry evil actors on the world stage might take advantage of the world's greatest superpower being led by a frail, weak, commander-in-chief.

If America's Leader is Frail & Weak, Will Israel's Enemies Choose Now to Strike Harder?

As columnist Amnon Lord put it in Israel Hayom, “In a world rife with aggressive forces, the unflattering image of an American president – the leader of the free world – appearing weak and incoherent encourages them to exploit opportunities.”

Israeli columnist Nadav Eyal added in Yediot Ahronot, , ""Weakness is not a trait that an American president can convey, by any means.""

Senator John Barrasso (R-Wyoming) expressed similar worries on Fox News this weekend, saying, ""It's what foreign leaders – our enemies – saw in that debate, in China, Russia, Iran, North Korea. Right now are they thinking, 'This is our moment of opportunity?'""

Biden Administration Accused of Still Withholding 7 Weapons Systems from Israel

Israeli Defense Minister Yoav Gallant told Israel Defense Forces in northern Israel this weekend it's their military might that may intimidate Hezbollah enough that it will halt its daily attacks in the region and negotiate a peace deal.

Gallant declared the nation is readying either for war or for peace, noting Israel is ""preparing the military force, defense, attack, and this can happen quickly. On the other hand, the political alternative is being prepared. It is always preferable. We are not looking for war, but we are ready for it.""

He added, ""The thing that gives us the flexibility to be able to discuss political solutions is that we have military solutions.""

But as Israel may soon face war with Hezbollah and its more than 150,000 missiles, one highly-placed U.S. lawmaker says the Biden administration is still withholding seven weapons systems from the Jewish Nation.

On Fox News Sunday, Rep. Michael McCaul (R-Texas), who chairs the powerful House Foreign Affairs Committee revealed, “This is what is most disturbing to me, is that we’re withholding weapon systems that I have signed off on and Congress has appropriated with the intent of sending those weapons to Israel.”

'Hamas is the Only Obstacle'

Noa Argamani, one of those four Israeli hostages rescued in Gaza recently, is speaking out. She's reminding the nation that so many hostages remain in captivity.

In a video, she implored, ""We can't forget about the hostages who are still in Hamas captivity, and we must do everything possible to bring them back home.""

Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu is pointing out that no hostage deal can currently be worked out because Hamas refuses to deal.

As he put it, “And today everyone knows a simple truth: Hamas is the only obstacle to the release of our hostages.""

Hamas claims the problem is that Israel won't agree to end the war and remove all its troops from Gaza.

""Without this being achieved, all that is presented is just a waste of time,"" said senior Hamas official Osama Hamdan.

Netanyahu, though, contends that there is no way to end the war until Hamas is completely defeated by Israeli forces.

""Every day they (the IDF) eliminate dozens of terrorists,"" Netanyahu stated. ""It is a difficult struggle that is waged above ground, sometimes in face-to-face battles, and it is also waged underground.""

“Anthem of Grace” kicked off with a massive global broadcast on Good Friday, hitting tens of millions of people with the Gospel. Translated into 60 languages, millions more are still consuming the content in nations across the world months after the event was first aired.

“It’s been amazing to see what God is doing,” Hall, founder of the Pulse Movement, told CBN News. “And I think we all know this, but … there’s a revival spreading. There’s joy, there’s hope.”

The evangelist said the Anthem of Grace campaign centers, in part, on “Amazing Grace,” the “most sung and most translated hymn ever.” Beyond that, he said the campaign seeks to focus on the power of the Gospel to change hearts and minds.

“[It also focuses on the] story of every believer whose life has been changed by this and trying to tell the story of God’s grace in our lives, and welcoming people into that anthem of grace,” Hall said.

The faith leader said the mission of highlighting the change God has made in people’s lives and helping others discover the same transformation in their own journeys is the pinnacle of the campaign.

“It’s just incredible to see the hunger, and we’re really just trying to see a global movement of just pointing back to the grace of God,” Hall said. “And, hopefully, equipping as many believers as possible to share that story of how God’s changed them.”

Hall said he is humbled to see how God has used his ministry to reach so many hearts.

Listen to the latest episode of “Quick Start”

“This is amazing. … I’ve got three kids, I’m in a ministry now 20 plus years,” he said. “And I’m just incredibly humbled and incredibly thankful to still be following Jesus. I’m thankful to be more in love with Jesus than I’ve ever been.”

At the end of the year, Hall said he hopes “Anthem of Grace” helps light a fire in the hearts of people who have not yet encountered the Lord.

“In my heart and talking to so many believers … I just believe Jesus is coming soon … I just go to, you know, ‘How do we see as many people as possible hear the Gospel and know the Gospel?'”

Hall continued, “Because we know that … the Word promises things, right? The Word’s going to go to the ends of the Earth and then Christ is going to return.”

The preacher offered a reminder of what the Bible says about the end of days, noting how Jesus proclaims there will be “wars, and rumors and wars” and other happenings. Every generation since Christ has awaited His return, but Hall said world conditions right now make it feel more impending.

“It does seem like there’s a quickening around the world,” he said. “And I think what we’re seeing is that the dark is getting darker and the evil is getting greater. And, with that, the light is seeing brighter.”

Hall wants every person who claims to know Jesus to “testify to the goodness of God” — something he believes would immediately transform global circumstances.

“It would change the world overnight … just the testimony of the saints,” Hall said. “Even in Revelation, it says, ‘We’re going to overcome by the blood of the lamb and the word of their testimony.'”

Thus, he hopes people’s testimonies make a massive difference by proving the Gospel’s power and sway to a watching world.","Evangelist Nick Hall is in the midst of yet another monumental, year-long evangelism campaign — and he believes hearts and souls are being transformed.

Hengaw, an organization reporting on human rights violations against Kurds in Iran, stated there has been no reason given for the charges against the five Christians.

Listen to the latest episode of “Quick Start”

Hamid Afzali was sentenced to 10 years behind bars, followed by Nasrollah Mousavi, Bijan Gholizadeh, and Iman Salehi, each of whom were sentenced to five years, and Zohrab Shahbazi, who received a nine-month jail sentence, The Jerusalem Post reported.

In a statement to CBN News, Todd Nettleton, vice president of message for the Voice of the Martyrs, said, “The growth of the church in Iran is wonderful news for Christians around the world, and a great reminder of God’s ability to grow His church in spite of anything that any government might do to stop it.”

“But the high price our Iranian brothers and sisters are paying to follow Christ is a different kind of reminder: to pray often for them as they willingly suffer for the name of Christ,” he added.

The report from Hengaw noted that, while Christians are “acknowledged as a religious minority in Iran, authorities impose severe penalties, especially on those who convert from Islam to Christianity.”

Iran’s decision to imprison the five Christian converts violates article 18 of the United Nations’ International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, which states, “Everyone shall have the right to freedom of thought, conscience and religion. This right shall include freedom to have or to adopt a religion or belief of his choice, and freedom, either individually or in community with others and in public or private, to manifest his religion or belief in worship, observance, practice, and teaching.”

In addition to these five Christian arrests, Hengaw noted that another recent Christian convert in Iran, Yasin Mousavi, has been sentenced to 15 years in prison for charges including “membership in groups or associations aimed at disrupting security” and “propaganda against the government through promoting Christianity.”

OpenDoors.org, which tracks Christian persecution around the globe, has placed Iran at No. 9 on its World Watch List and rates the persecution Christians face in the Muslim-ruled country as “extreme.”

“For Christians who convert from Islam, not even the veneer of tolerance is present. Conversion from Islam to Christianity is illegal in Iran, and anyone caught as a convert can be arrested and imprisoned,” the organization explained in part. “The government views conversion as an attempt by the West to undermine Islam and the Islamic government of Iran. This means that anyone who is discovered to be a member of a house church can be charged with a crime against national security, which can lead to long prison sentences.”

Now, it's on a mission to build 40 more megachurches in the next 10 years.

Most roads in Hyderabad on Sundays lead to Calvary Temple. Shortly after 4 a.m., side streets around the church here are already jammed.

As church volunteers coordinate traffic, shuttle buses, auto rickshaws, and motorcycles ferry thousands of people, all trying to get here two hours ahead of Calvary's first of five services that begin at 6 a.m.

By sunrise, the faithful have taken their seats.

The main sanctuary holds 18,000 people supported by adjacent Bethlehem Hall with 15,000 and a third structure accommodating more than 3,000 more.

Hundreds more watch on television screens scattered around the sprawling Calvary campus.

Pastor Satish Kumar preaches all five services with the last one ending at 8 p.m.

""I've been given the grace to pastor this church which is beyond my dream and imagination,"" Pastor Kumar told CBN News.

Calvary Temple started in 2005 with about two dozen people. Today, it boasts more than 300,000 members making it one of the largest churches in the world.

They have 11 satellite churches with plans for more nationwide expansion.

""God put a burden in my heart to establish 40 mega churches just like what you see here during the next 10 years,"" said Kumar.

Pastor Kumar says the church adds some 3,000 new believers each month in a sign that the Lord is moving mightily across the country.

""God's hand is upon India, it's a time for India to reach the lost, not only within the country but across the globe,"" Kumar said.

In addition, the church produces over 650 TV programs each month in 17 of the country's major languages for broadcast on national television.

""It's not only within the nation, but also in Bangladesh, Nepal, Sri Lanka, Afghanistan, Pakistan and Gulf countries,"" said Kumar.

Millions more follow on social media. The reason for the church's success?

""Preaching the pure Word of God is what attracts people, and practicing the Word of God is what keeps people within the church,"" said Kumar.

That practical demonstration is on full display here each Sunday.

Narayana Podhili works as a civil engineer during the week. On Sunday, he leads an army of 150 church volunteers who spend hours chopping, slicing, peeling, and stirring – all to prepare free breakfast, lunch, and dinner meals for 50,000 people.

""We are committed to come here every Sunday at 3:30 a.m., 4 a.m., and we keep working till evening,"" Podhili told CBN News as he marshaled his forces.

Nagavalli Mendem has served in the Calvary kitchen for seven years after making a promise to God that if He healed her cancerous tumor, she would serve the church in this capacity.

""Because I made that promise, God healed me completely without surgery,"" Mendem said. ""God cleared the tumor in my chest and healed me. As a thanksgiving to Him, I serve here at the Lord's house.""

She and volunteers feed more than 200,000 people each month.

""In India, we say, 'service to mankind is service to God' so that is what we try to practice,"" Kumar said. ""We try to show God's love in action in every possible way that we find.""

Calvary also has an on-campus hospital where members get free medical treatment on Sundays and medicines at reduced cost.

""The majority of the people who come here are poor and cannot afford treatment,"" said Dr. Vinod Kumar of Calvary Hospital.

Members also have access to church facilities to hold marriages. And when a church member passes away, Calvary handles all funeral, burial, and meal arrangements – again, all for free.

In 2007, Calvary Temple created an access card system, the first of its kind, to follow up with members and their families.

""I have thousands of people. How do I know who hasn't shown up on a Sunday? As I was praying God put access card into my mind,"" Kumar said.

Each member must swipe their card when attending any one of the five Sunday services.

""Without fail, if we don't show up to church, we get a call,"" said Chandraiah, a Calvary Temple member. ""They'll ask me why I didn't come to church and after they find out they will pray for me. I'm happy when I receive that call. Not only that, but the fact also that they care for us is special, and because of that we will surely come to the next service.""

Pastor Kumar says prayer has always been an integral part of their success. The church has held 40 days of prayer and fasting regularly since 2005 drawing tens of thousands of young participants to stadiums around the country.

""During this 40 days of fasting and prayer, I teach from Genesis to Revelation,"" Kumar told CBN News. ""Every book I try to explain. Hundreds of thousands of young kids end up reading the whole Bible.""

Each month, the church, along with its satellite campuses, holds a ""Night with God"" as members pray for revival.

""About 25,000 to 30,000 people join. That has been the biggest, largest all-night prayer services in our nation,"" Kumar said.

In recent years, however, India has witnessed an unprecedented uptick in violence against Christians.

""The more the persecution, the more the church grows and that's what's happening in India,"" Kumar said.

Most attacks are carried out by Hindu extremist groups who accuse Christians of forcibly converting people to Christianity.

Pastor Kumar, a Hindu convert to Christianity himself, says resistance produces power.

""No persecution has ever succeeded in stopping the preaching of the Word of God, it always promoted the Word of God and spread the Word of God across the countries,"" said Kumar. ""It's my passion, my burden that before I die, I want to see every Indian will hear the gospel and know the Savior.""

Oklahoma's top education official ordered public schools to incorporate the Bible into lessons for grades five through 12 this week.

State school superintendent Ryan Walters says his mandate is compulsory and “immediate and strict compliance is expected.”

He points out that since the Bible's influence on America and Western civilization has been foundational, students need to be educated about its role in U.S. and world history.

""The Bible is an indispensable historical and cultural touchstone,"" Walters said. ""Without basic knowledge of it, Oklahoma students are unable to properly contextualize the foundation of our nation which is why Oklahoma educational standards provide for its instruction.""

Walters has previously noted that America is in a culture war and he doesn't want “woke ideology” spread by the state's public schools.

Left-wing groups have predictably threatened legal action calling the state school superintendent's move a violation of the U.S. Constitution. “Public schools are not Sunday schools,” said Rachel Laser, president and CEO of Americans United for Separation of Church and State.

Oklahoma law explicitly allows Bibles in the classroom and lets teachers use them in instruction.

But earlier this week the Oklahoma Supreme Court blocked the state's attempt to launch the first publicly funded religious charter school in the U.S.

He went on to condemn the modern political left as “aggressively anti-common sense” during an interview with English journalist Tina Brown at the Aspen Ideas Festival in Colorado.

“Part of it the left has to own,” he told Brown. “They are aggressively anti-common sense. The Democrats keep running on this one idea, saying to the American people, ‘You can’t possibly think you can do worse than Donald Trump.’ And they keep saying, ‘Yes, we can. Yes, we can.'”

Maher went on to explain he has Democratic friends who have leftist children, many of whom, the comedian suggested, accuse their parents of “old thinking” and not understanding their progressive points of view.

“Tear down statues of Lincoln? Maybe give communism another shot? Get rid of the border patrol? Get rid of capitalism? White supremacy has never been worse? Gender is always just a social construct? It’s OK to have penises in the women’s swimming pool, in women’s prisons?” he said, listing a handful of the views held by leftists. “No, it’s not that I’m old; it’s that your ideas are stupid.”

Listen to the latest episode of “Quick Start”:

Maher explained to Brown that, if Democrats insist on embracing far-leftist ideals and refuse to collaborate in any way with Republicans who oppose Trump, they are only aiding the GOP in defeating incumbent President Joe Biden.

“That’s as good as it gets,” he said. “If you can’t talk to those people, you’re just abandoning the country to half the people who are even worse, who are going to vote for Trump this next time — and they are — and he very likely will win, and then what are we going to do?”

“I think we should keep the dialogue open,” the HBO’s “Real Time” host added.

Maher recently appeared on the ABC talk show “The View,” where he condemned those on the left who have chosen to vehemently oppose Israel and protest in support of Hamas.

“If I had any doubt that I was right about the change that’s happened in the left, watching people protest for a terrorist organization like Hamas — that straightened me out pretty quick,” he said, later adding, “It’s astounding to me that they can’t tell the good guys from the bad guys, just morally. If you’re for Hamas, just live in Gaza for a day … [even] before the war.”

Ultimately, he said the best way to stop Israel from retaliating is to “stop attacking Israel.”

In what's widely known as the Chevron case, the court took a step to curb the ability of the ballooning federal bureaucracy to bypass Congress with backdoor regulations.

In the other case, the high court issued a ruling about obstruction that could have a big impact on the future of President Trump and Capitol riot defendants.

The Chevron Case & the 'Deep State'



In a far-reaching decision, the Supreme Court upended the 40-year-old Chevron precedent that made it easier for federal government agencies to create their own rules on issues like the environment, public health, and business regulations.

The original Chevron decision allowed federal agencies to unilaterally fill in the details whenever government officials claimed the laws passed by Congress were too ambiguous.

Critics have argued for decades that only Congress has been given the power to legislate, so allowing bureaucrats broad power to invent thousands of regulations violates the U.S. Constitution. It's one of the reasons those critics have referred to the massive size of the federal government as the ""nanny state"" or even the ""deep state"" because unelected bureaucrats often seized that opportunity to operate autonomously from the legislative or judicial branches.

THE CHEVRON CASE David v Goliath: Small Businesses Fight Federal Bureaucracy at US Supreme Court

BREAKING: In a major blow to the unelected administrative state, the Supreme Court has overruled the Chevron doctrine, which required courts to defer to the legal interpretations of unelected bureaucrats.



“Chevron is overruled.” pic.twitter.com/tqC5EYaUBl — Sean Davis (@seanmdav) June 28, 2024

Chief Justice John Roberts wrote the court's opinion stating, ""Perhaps most fundamentally, Chevron's presumption is misguided because agencies have no special competence in resolving statutory ambiguities. Courts do.""

Tyler O'Neil, managing editor of the Daily Signal, wrote on X, ""This is a huge step forward for holding the administrative state—and the deep state—accountable.""

The Capitol Riot and Obstruction

In the other major case, the Supreme Court made it harder to charge Capitol riot defendants with obstruction, a charge that also has been brought against former President Donald Trump.

In a 6-3 ruling, the court ruled that charging someone with obstructing an official proceeding must include proof that defendants tried to tamper with or destroy documents. Only some of the people who breached the Capitol on Jan. 6, 2021, fall into that category, so many of those cases are expected to be affected by reduced sentencing.

Liberty Counsel Founder and Chairman Mat Staver said, ""This new narrow interpretation will make it difficult for these indictments to stand.""

Chief Justice John Roberts wrote Friday's decision, joined by Justices Samuel Alito, Neil Gorsuch, Brett Kavanaugh, and Clarence Thomas, and by Biden nominee Justice Ketanji Brown Jackson.

It's unclear how the court's decision might affect the obstruction case by Special Counsel Jack Smith against Trump in Washington. But the high court is expected to release a separate decision Monday regarding presidential immunity, and that ruling will directly impact Smith's case.

German-born Alexander Dietze learned about Germany’s history and the Holocaust in school, but it wasn't discussed at home. Raised in a secular household, he became a Christian in his early 20s.

Years later, an abrupt awakening came when his grandfather offered him Nazi SS medals as part of their family heritage. This moment spurred Alexander and his wife, Cäcilia, to found the ministry Back to Zion, dedicated to helping Holocaust survivors in Israel.

Each week, the Dietzes invite Holocaust survivors to their home, sharing their story, providing meals, singing Israeli songs in Hebrew, and gifting bouquets of flowers.

But the amount of firepower being assembled on Israel's northern border suggests that war could start any day now.

By the tens of thousands, Israeli troops continue gathering and preparing on that border with Lebanon. Their purpose is to stop Hezbollah terrorists who've been attacking northern Israel from Lebanon almost daily for months.

That's forced some 80,000 Israelis to flee their homes and empty out whole communities near the border. As Kiryat Shmona resident Yarden Haziza puts it, ""Living right now in Kiryat Shmona is very sad. The city is empty most of the time.""

Hezbollah hit the north with some 40 rockets on just Thursday alone. The terrorists say it was to avenge a number of recent Israeli air strikes on Hezbollah infrastructure and personnel.

'On the March to Conquer the Middle East'

As the war against Hamas grinds on in Gaza and tensions mount in the north, Israel's prime minister keeps trying to get the world to focus on the threat from Iran, the massive power behind both Hezbollah and Hamas. Benjamin Netanyahu insists Iran's jihadists have an evil goal.

He's warning Iran and its proxies are, as he put it, ""On the march to conquer the Middle East.""

Visiting the north this week, Israel's president complained the international community is doing little to stave off war. So Isaac Herzog said it shouldn't be surprised if, as he said, ""The situation spirals out of control.""

Exuberant Defiance of Terrorism

Even as Israel braces for what could be another massive and painful war, the Tribe of Nova came together in Tel Aviv Thursday in exuberant defiance of terrorism. They held their first mass concert since Hamas attacked their festival near Gaza on October 7th.

Nimrod Arnin's sister was among the more than 360 festival-goers killed there.

He told the concert crowd, “On that Saturday at the beginning of October, our light was put to the test - a test which in our worst nightmares we didn’t imagine we would have to pass. The ultimate darkness challenged the big light of the Tribe of Nova.""

The Thursday concert featured dozens of dancers on stage re-enacting the horror of that morning. And the crowd of tens of thousands all stood quiet in a long moment of silence commemorating all who were lost.

'We Will Dance Again!'

But the main message of the day wasn't at all somber. It was that Israelis will not let the terrorists steal away their lust for life, or their joy, or their dance.

As concert attendee Maxim Mileyev put it, ""Nothing can stop us from living our lives here in Israel. And nothing can stop us from keeping on dancing and living.”

Nimrod Arnin summed up what so many in the Tribe of Nova have come to know. He told the concert crowd, ""In a moment of enlightenment we realized what is going to be the essence of our life from now and on. We will dance again!""

The crowd cheered him...and danced for hours. They wanted to show that while Hamas worships death, Israelis embrace life...and life to the fullest.

Some are even calling for Biden to be replaced as the nominee.



Voters were also concerned by what they saw from the president as he struggled and stumbled throughout the evening.



Within the opening minutes, he flubbed a line saying, ""What I've been able to do with the Covid, excuse me, with, dealing with everything we have to do with, look, if we finally beat Medicare.""

Cognitive Concerns



It became clear to the former President's surrogates, that Biden was in trouble.

Rep. Elise Stefanik (R-NY) said, ""The Biden campaign said this would be the reset moment for Joe Biden's candidacy and what they saw, what the American people saw, was a weak, horrible president, who is the weakest president in our nation's history.""



Voter concerns about Biden's age and mental sharpness were on display during the 90-minute debate as the president struggled at times to answer questions.



Sen. Marco Rubio (R-FL) said, ""He repeated things that were not true and he also said things that, to be frank, there were times that I could not understand what he was saying.""



The showdown had Biden and Trump, the two oldest candidates to ever seek the White House, trading barbs on a number of topics.



On the Economy



""The only jobs he created are for illegal immigrants and bounce back jobs that bounce back from the Covid. He has not done a good job, he's done a poor job, and inflation is killing our country,"" Trump said.



On Abortion



""We are not for late-term abortion. Period. Period, period,"" Biden said.

Trump replied, ""Under Roe v Wade, you have late-term abortion. You can do whatever you want. Depending on the state, you can do whatever you want. We don't think that's a good thing. We think it's a radical thing. We think the Democrats are the radicals.""



On Immigration



Biden said, ""When he was president, he was taking separating babies from their mothers, put him in cages, making sure that the families were separated. That's not the way to go.""



Trump pushed back accusing Biden of putting in place weak border policies that make America unsafe.

""We have the largest number of terrorists coming into our country right now. All terrorists all over the world, not just in South America, all over the world. They come from the Middle East, everywhere, all over the world. That pouring in. And this guy just left it open.""

Biden's Poor Performance



The two also tackled wars in Ukraine and Gaza.



But by the end of the night, everyone was talking about President Biden's poor performance.

Michigan resident Rosanne Ponkowski said, ""I have dealt with people that have dementia before, and it's very obvious just from the look on his face, not understanding what's going on, the surprised and shocked look sometimes, the eyes, the very stiff face, the very stiff hands, they're all very prominent signs of what's going on.""

The White House tried to put a brave face on the evening telling reporters that Biden had a cold.



Surrogates like California Governor Gavin Newsom (D) attempted to side-step voter concerns that the president is too old.



CBN News directly asked Gov. Newsom, ""There's a lot of concern about the president's stamina and mental health. Are you concerned, 81 years old, are concerned about that going forward?"" Newsom replied, ""I'm worried about President Trump's stamina."" We followed up with, ""No, I'm talking about the president."" Newsom replied, ""No, I'm talking about President Trump as well.""



One top Biden donor reportedly called the president's performance disqualifying, telling Reuters that he expects Democrats will urge him to step aside ahead of the party's national convention in August.

Still, in a post-debate rally, Biden told supporters that he was confident he could win against Trump. ""Look, we're going to beat this guy. We need to beat this guy. And I need you in order to beat him. You're the people I've run for,"" Biden said.



Coming into the debate, Biden and Trump found themselves nearly tied in some national opinion polls. We'll see in the coming days whether this debate did anything to significantly change those dynamics. For now, though, the race is set to be decided here in Georgia and a handful of other key swing states like Wisconsin, Michigan, and Arizona. Meanwhile, voters there and across the country will get another look at the candidates on September 10th.","ATLANTA – Democrats are panicking over President Biden's shaky performance in last night's historic debate with former President Trump.

The hijab — the headscarf traditionally worn by many Middle East women — is becoming harder to spot in Iran these days.

For many Iranian women, the hijab has become a symbol of oppression. They're refusing to wear it, even under the threat of beatings and imprisonment.

Change is coming to the autocratic, saber-rattling Islamic Republic of Iran that Americans see on the news. And it's coming fast.

It's clearly visible on the streets of the capital Tehran in the wake of the mass protests that began in September 2022, following the death in police custody of Mahsa Amini, a 22-year-old woman who resisted wearing her hijab.

The raw emotion of the protests — including images of women publicly burning their hijabs — has evolved into a controlled expression of resoluteness and strength.

Explosive Yearning

The protests, known as the ""Women, Life, Freedom Movement"", burst the cork out of the bottle. The demonstrations, resulting in thousands of arrests and more than 500 deaths over several months, were an explosion of yearning for women's rights.

And the Iranian regime got the message loud and clear.

The protests cleared the fog and smoke between the demands of the people and the demands of the state. A clear line has been drawn. Both know what each other's demands are. The government has resumed its ""morality police"" project to force women to wear the hijab. But Iranian women are not backing off.

This movement continues to gather momentum.

Increasingly, Iranian men are showing broad support for women's rights and freedoms. They're recognizing core human rights that benefit the whole of society. This would have been unimaginable just a few years ago.

The change is not only social. It's religious, too.

Christians in Iran have long been subjected to persecution and even torture and death. Today, Iran has the third highest number of religious prisoners, with 347 citizens behind bars for their faith — and those are just ones we know about.

But most Iranians don't see Christians as ""the enemy"" anymore.

A generation ago, the idea of being an Iranian and a Christian was unthinkable, unforgivable even. Now it's accepted without a blink.

Yet the hardline regime still denies citizens the freedom to attend church or convert to Christianity. Officially, there isn't a single Farsi-speaking church in the entire nation of 90 million people.

Illegal house churches — believers secretly meeting in homes — are raided routinely by the police, their leaders interrogated and imprisoned.

A New Revolution

But new media platforms, including Zoom, Instagram, and WhatsApp, are revolutionizing church for Iran's ""isolated"" believers.

They're worshiping online in real-time with other isolated believers outside Iran in places such as Türkiye, building a sense of Christian unity in a region that's 97% non-Christian. Respected Iranian Bible teachers living in exile overseas teach and preach via Zoom and on-air via live broadcasts, encouraging and strengthening the underground church.

There's more to this new media revolution.

SAT-7, the multimedia ministry with which I serve in the Middle East, launched the first-ever Christian video-on-demand streaming service in the region, which is totally free to watch.

Social media, especially Instagram, allows us to connect directly with Iranians watching live programs on satellite television or on their phones and digital devices. Viewers, young and old, pepper us with questions about Jesus and Christianity.

A boy named Kaamran told us: ""The kids at school know I'm a Christian. They ask questions and I don't know how to answer. I pray for them. I really want the Lord's throne to be set up here in Iran.""

Change is coming to Iran. It's coming fast.

In fact, it's already here.

He helped launch SAT-7's online Church for Kids in Iran and ""digital church"" for isolated believers who have no other way to attend church.","ANALYSIS: Change Is Coming to Iran, and It's Coming FastThe hijab — the headscarf traditionally worn by many Middle East women — is becoming harder to spot in Iran these days.

(AP Photo/Alex Brandon)

In one of the most eagerly anticipated opinions of this term, the U.S. Supreme Court has essentially decided to kick the can down the road on Idaho's abortion law.

The official release of the ruling comes a day after the decision was prematurely leaked by someone at the Supreme Court. It was published online briefly on Wednesday before being removed. A court spokeswoman said the post was a mistake.

The decision will allow emergency abortions for now in a procedural ruling that leaves key questions unanswered. For now, the Idaho case will continue to play out in lower courts, and could end up before the Supreme Court again.

Liberty Counsel Founder and Chairman Mat Staver explained, ""This order means that the case returns to the Ninth Circuit, which had ordered that the appeal of the preliminary injunction be decided by the full court on an expedited basis without any further briefing. The abortion ban currently remains in place in Idaho, except for those in emergency room situations.""

WATCH Our Analysis: Supreme Court Rules on Idaho Abortion Ban

What the Case Is Really About

The Biden administration had sued Idaho claiming the state's law violates a federal law called the Emergency Medical Treatment and Labor Act (EMTALA). The White House insists the EMTALA requires hospital emergency rooms to provide abortions to women if their general health is at risk. Idaho's law already provided an exception to save the life of the mother, so the case is seen as an effort to expand abortion access beyond that.

Idaho Solicitor General Joshua Turner suggested the Biden administration's ""health"" definition is too broad because it could be interpreted to include many non-life-threatening health concerns, including mental health.

And the Alliance Defending Freedom accused the Biden administration of trying to invent ""a federal abortion mandate by manipulating EMTALA.""

During the arguments at the court, Justice Samuel Alito said the EMTALA was not intended to include abortion because it specifically identifies unborn children as patients who should be cared for in emergency rooms.

""One potentially very important phrase in EMTALA,"" he said, ""is the reference to the woman's unborn child. Isn't that an odd phrase to put in a statute that imposes a mandate to perform abortions? Have you ever seen an abortion statute that uses the phrase, 'unborn child?'""

Alito pointed out, ""So in that situation, the hospital must stabilize the threat to the unborn child. And it seems like the plain meaning is that the hospital must try to eliminate any immediate threat to the child. Performing an abortion is antithetical to that duty.""

Abortion Leaks at the Supreme Court

Two years ago, Politico obtained a draft of the Dobbs ruling that overturned Roe v. Wade, stoking widespread outrage by pro-choice activists before the ruling was officially meant to be revealed. It fueled extremists who began firebombing and vandalizing pro-life pregnancy clinics and issuing death threats to the workers who try to help women facing unexpected pregnancies.

The Supreme Court never discovered who infamously leaked that Dobbs ruling, and now there is speculation about why this Idaho abortion ruling was also leaked.



Pro-life activist Kristan Hawkins posted on X, ""With media reporting on what appears to be a disappointing outcome in the EMTALA case, you have to wonder whether it's time for some people working on our nation's highest court need to be invited to find new jobs. Did the person who leaked the Dobbs decision 'accidentally' post today? Inquiring minds want to know.""","An pro-life protestor is seen on the ground after being pushed during a protest by abortion activists at the Supreme Court, June 24, 2024.

During the great North Korea starvation in 1998, Mrs. Son served in the military, as caretaker of supplies and later as a broadcaster of the Juche, North Korea's propaganda outlet.



She told CBN News, ""My father was the provincial governor and bribed the military officer with a pig so I could get in because it was a way we can get food rations and not starve like the rest of the country. But things got bad when my father lost the elections. He became very sick and died. My brother was detained and died of starvation in prison.""



In order to survive, Mrs. Son and her mother escaped to China.



""We swam across the Tuman River for two days and bribed the North Korean soldiers and brokers in China. There we found a Christian church who helped us,"" Mrs. Son said.



After a few months, Chinese police began to trail them. Mrs. Son shared her harrowing experience.

""My mom noticed the police. She told me to jump out of the van when it stopped. I took off my clothes and shoes and gave to my mom because it was winter time and she needed to be warm. With only my underwear on, I jumped out of the van and 8 Chinese police chased me. I was already a Christian but not deep. But I knew it was God who protected me and instructed me to hide and hold onto the under bars of a truck. I got away but my mom was taken back to North Korea. I went back to try to find her only to find out that she suffered and died in prison because she did not deny her Christian faith.""



Mrs. Son eventually returned to China where she married a Chinese Christian. Several months later, she was re-captured though this time her husband gave her money to help her escape.



""Right before I was transferred to North Korea, I put all the money, the paper bills in plastic bags and swallowed them so that the soldiers will not see them. A week later, I got them all out. I used this to bribe the soldiers and brokers to go back to China.""



After yet another arrest, Mrs. Son spent 400 days in a North Korean prison under inhumane conditions where once again, she experienced God's help.



""The guard was my friend and he gave me rice. But it was the worse because I had to eat insects to survive. After 400 days, I was released… malnourished and could barely walk. This was when my husband used his Chinese citizenship to get me to South Korea,"" Mrs. Son recounted.



Once in South Korea, Mrs. Son joined the Seopyoung Church where she grew in her Christian faith. She realized how God saved her miraculously each time she was arrested.

The name of the church, ""Seopyoung"" stands for Seoul, the capital of South Korea and Pyongyang, the capital of North Korea. Most of its members are North Koreans whom they help settle in South Korea. The church envisions a unified North and South Korea by spreading the gospel in North Korea.



Rev. Chun Myeong Guen, head pastor of Seopyoung Church, said, ""It is impossible for North and South Korea to reunite politically because of different cultures and backgrounds. Therefore, reunification can only happen through faith because there will be no misunderstanding of each other. Only faith can make us reunite overnight.""

""During the starvation, many North Korean defectors escaped to China. Many believed Jesus, received Christian education in other countries and became missionaries in North Korea where there are now about 600,000 Christians in underground churches,"" he reports. ""Many Christians in South Korea who are praying for reunification believe it will happen in 5 years. It is like a ticking bomb.""



North Korean Christians like Mrs. Son can help make this happen.



""I want to thank my Mom and be like her. She gave her life for her Christian faith. I am also dedicating my life to serve Jesus Christ and spread the gospel and worship Him until I die,"" Mrs. Son said.","""We swam across the Tuman River for two days and bribed the North Korean soldiers and brokers in China.

Those are the words of Lex Renick, a female who formerly identified as a transgender male before she and her husband — who used to identify as homosexual — came to faith in Jesus.

Nic and Lex Renick got married on May 30, 2020, when both of them were living out their LGBT lifestyles. They have since turned away from their past decisions, with Lex restoring her female identity and returning to the name she was given at birth and Nic abandoning his homosexual identity.

Listen to the latest episode of “Quick Start”

The pair married one another as husband and husband but, since their respective salvation experiences, now identify as a heterosexual couple — husband and wife. They recently spoke with The Daily Wire’s Michael Knowles about their salvation experiences in a lengthy interview.

Knowles, a Catholic, described the couple’s testimony as “one of the wildest stories I’ve ever heard.”

In addition to restoring their live spiritually, Lex and Nic told Knowles they are seeing physical restoration. The two now share a healthy baby and, early on in their relationship, Lex underwent biopsies and was told she had cancerous cells in her body. But a doctor from Planned Parenthood recently told her, “This doesn’t make physical possible sense, but you no longer have any cancerous cells in your body.”

“I think it just goes to show that anyone can transform or turn into anything that they want,” said Nic of their experience together. “But nobody talks about transforming back to the original design that you’re supposed to be.”

He continued, “The world can tell you so much about who you’re ‘supposed to be’ based off of your interests or your personality type, and try to fit you into all of these crazy, outlandish boxes that might … make you feel included for a time.”

For her part, Lex opened up about the fact she believed the “lie” of the LGBT community.

“The whole world in the queer community was saying, ‘Well, you know if God made you then God made you this way,'” she recalled hearing. “[But] that argument doesn’t work with the trans community. Because, if we say, ‘God made me this way,’ then that means that I should have been a woman.”

Lex went on to explain to Knowles she found solace in the LGBT community because she was desperate for identity and belonging — something she had not previously found in her family or faith.

She grew up in an abusive household — one that claimed to be “Christian” — with a mother who struggled with alcoholism and even once told Lex, “If I would have known that you were going to be my child, I would have aborted you,” a comment her mother made after learning Lex struggled with her sexuality and gender identity.

Every time she tried to find comfort and safety in her family or in a church, Lex said they would “reject me.” Ultimately, she found the belonging she desired in the LGBT movement.

“I ran to this loving community, and that was the queer community, because they accepted me for me, not that I needed edifying or acceptance from the church,” she recalled. “I just needed a loving body of believers or family to wrap their arms around me and say, ‘Hey, we’re going to walk with you through this journey.’ But all I faced was rejection.”

Nic, on the other hand, began identifying as homosexual as a teenager but never faced the kind of isolation and rejection Lex experienced. His family, he said, “never tried to change me,” even though they took issue with his sexual identity, believing it contradicted God’s design for males and females.

“They didn’t condone or agree with what I was doing, and that is the exact Christian model of how I feel we should address the community,” he said. “We can’t shun or reject nor condone at the same time.”

Initially, as a transgender male — meaning biologically female — and a homosexual male, the couple wanted to have children, even when Lex was identifying as a man. But since their transformation, they have abandoned their former identities and now are true to their biological realities: a female and a male.

They currently share one child and just announced they are pregnant with their second baby.

The couple said they eventually found a church in Las Vegas where, even though its leaders didn’t condone their LGBT lifestyles, they welcomed them in as they were. It was there that they experienced true spiritual transformation.

“They chose to love us,” Lex said of the church they attended. “And that ministered to our hearts so much because we got to hang out with more believers and allow God to do the work on our hearts and then have friends in our lives to encourage us in the leading of the Lord rather than separating and kind of gatekeeping Jesus by taking people out of the church.”

In March, Lex and Nic renewed their wedding vows for the first time as husband and wife.

“I’m so in AWE of the Goodness of God,” Lex wrote in an Instagram post. “He is so so good! So many tears hearing my husband say, ‘I do,’ after Pastor Ivan said, ‘Do you take her to be your bride.’ Words, I never thought would be so sweet to hear deep within my soul. What an honor it is to be Nic’s bride. What an honor it is to serve God together and build His Kingdom.”

Rachel Levine, assistant secretary for health at the Department of Health and Human Services and herself a transgender woman, urged them to drop the proposed limits from the group's guidelines and apparently succeeded,"" The Times reports.

The administration was reportedly concerned that age minimums would trigger political backlash that could fuel legislation opposing the trans ideology.

More than two dozen states now have laws restricting gender-altering medical experiments on the bodies of minors. And this week, the Supreme Court agreed to hear the Biden administration's challenge to one of those laws.

LATEST Supreme Court Takes up Hot Topic of Gender-Altering Procedures on Children

Critics say children are too young to make these irreversible, life-altering decisions while supporters claim that young people with gender dysphoria need the procedures right away.

But as CBN News reported earlier this year, U.S.-based think tank Environmental Progress reported that even the WPATH admitted behind closed doors that ""children and adolescents cannot comprehend the lifelong consequences of 'gender-affirming care,' and in some cases, due to poor health literacy, neither can their parents.""

When we confronted WPATH about those claims, Marci Bowers, M.D., president of the group, told us in a statement, ""The world is not flat. Gender, like genitalia, is represented by diversity. The small percentage of the population that is trans or gender diverse deserves healthcare and will never be a threat to the global gender binary.""

Meanwhile, England and other European nations are backing away from transition procedures on minors after studies showed ""weak evidence"" that they lead to long-term positive impacts.

""This is one instance in which I think Europe is headed in the right direction,"" Sarah Parshall Perry of the Heritage Foundation told CBN's Wendy Griffith. ""In addition to that, we are now seeing Norway, Finland, Sweden, and now the most recent edition is Scotland who has backed off the use of chemical castration agents as well.""

There is also a growing number of people who regret undergoing gender transition and are seeking to revert back to their biological gender. They're warning distressed children and their families about rushing into life-altering medical decisions.

This debate is also the earliest in modern history, well ahead of the traditional fall schedule.

New rules aim to prevent chaotic scenes from past debates. There will be no live audience, no opening statements, and both candidates' microphones will be muted unless it's their turn to speak.

Performance on the debate stage might be the most crucial aspect for the 81-year-old Biden as Republicans highlight his age and mental health.

""Which Joe Biden's going to show up?"" asked House Speaker Mike Johnson. ""My summary is this: It doesn't matter if he drinks a whole gallon of energy drinks, he's not going to be able to match the acumen and the readiness of Donald Trump.""

Nathan Gonzales from Inside Elections tells CBN News that because some Republicans have portrayed Biden as too old and incompetent, the real challenge may lie with Donald Trump. ""Trump is used to feeding off the crowd and energy in the room, and that's just not going to be there,"" Gonzales explained. ""Trump is going to have to be disciplined when it comes to time and whether the mic is on or off. He must avoid being perceived as a bully.""

Biden is expected to focus on Trump's 34 felony convictions—a first for a presidential candidate—and other pending criminal cases. He will also likely address the abortion issue after the Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade, thanks to three Trump appointees. Trump, on the other hand, is expected to highlight issues such as the flood of unchecked migrants on the U.S. southern border and high inflation.

President Biden has been preparing for the debate at Camp David over the past several days. Former President Trump has been on the campaign trail, and Wednesday night, he attended a prayer conference call with members of a faith advisory board.

That news comes as top Israeli leaders visited the border with Lebanon where war could break out any day.

Aides to the prime minister have reportedly told the White House that when Netanyahu addresses a joint session of Congress in July, he'll present a new take on achieving a pathway to a Palestinian state. That would be a huge shift.

Yet those reports may be wrong. The Prime Minister's Office told The Times of Israel that Netanyahu ""opposes a Palestinian state and will not change his position in his address to Congress.""

The prime minister has consistently opposed Palestinian statehood in recent years, as poll after poll shows a huge majority of West Bank Palestinians themselves don't want a state next to Israel. They just want Israel destroyed.

Itamar Marcus, director of Palestinian Media Watch, points out most Palestinians hail the murderous attacks on Israelis, including what happened on October 7th.

""There's tremendous support within the West Bank for what happened on October 7th,"" Marcus stated. ""There was a poll taken a month and a half after October 7th – and everyone knew what happened, everybody knew about the rape and the destruction and the massacres – and Palestinians were asked 'With everything that's happened up till now, does it make you proud as a Palestinian?' And 98 percent of Palestinians said it made them proud.""

Preparing for War with Hezbollah & US Weapons Delays

On another front, both Netanyahu and Israeli President Isaac Herzog toured Israel's northern border with Lebanon this week. That's where all-out war may soon come, as the Jewish nation seeks to end daily attacks from Hezbollah on Israeli communities along the border.

In Washington, Israel's Defense Minister Yoav Gallant has supposedly made progress in speeding up shipments of weapons to the U.S. from Israel.

Netanyahu has accused the Biden administration of deliberately slow-walking such shipments.

For the first time, the U.S. administration is admitting there have been bottlenecks in getting some of those weapons shipped.

Gallant addressed Americans, saying Israel needs the U.S. by its side. ""The powerful and enduring bond between the United States and Israel is key to our nation's strategy and our security,"" the defense minister said.

Pennsylvania Sen. John Fetterman has been one Democrat particularly strong in supporting Israel's war with Hamas as others have wavered. He's met with Netanyahu on his first visit here. ""We stand with Israel through this and I'm so sorry for what's been done to this nation,"" Fetterman declared.

Turkey's President Recep Tayyip Erdogan pledged that his nation will stand with Hezbollah if it comes to war. He's condemning Western nations for backing Netanyahu, whose mental fitness he questioned. Erdogan asserted, ""It is extremely bad and pathetic that governments that talk about freedom, human rights, and justice are captives of a mentally ill person like Netanyahu.""

Antisemitism in NYC

In New York City, a masked man who demanded Jews get off a subway car earlier this month faces criminal charges of attempted coercion. He had yelled, ""Raise your hands if you're a Zionist – this is your chance to get out!""

Earlier this week, several dozen people protested against Manhattan District Attorney Alvin Bragg for his refusal to prosecute most of the anti-Israel demonstrators who illegally occupied Columbia University's Hamilton Hall this spring.

One protester said of Bragg, ""He's either a coward or an antisemite.""

Americans are being treated for health conditions such as heart disease, cancer, and depression to the tune of $43 trillion a year. One doctor believes up to 80 percent of these illnesses could be avoided by addressing what truly causes them.

After watching her beloved mother suffer from poor health for decades and then die relatively young, Casey Means pursued a career in medicine to help others avoid what happened to her mom.

""She had seen her doctors faithfully, taken all the medications, done exactly what they said, but the reality is she never healed,"" Dr. Means told CBN News.

Ditching Mainstream Medicine

After becoming a head and neck surgeon, Dr. Means became disillusioned with the entire process and walked away from mainstream medicine.

""What I saw in the health care system is that we're spending more money every single year on treating diseases, but patients in America aren't really getting better. Our rates of chronic illnesses are going up every single year,"" she said.

Dr. Means believes this is due to the system ignoring the root cause of many diseases, which she labels metabolic dysfunction.

""This leads to every imaginable chronic disease we're facing today from cancer to heart disease, stroke, Alzheimer's, dementia, type two diabetes, obesity, depression, anxiety, migraine, infertility, erectile dysfunction, you name it,"" Dr. Means said.

She explains in her book, Good Energy: The Surprising Connection Between Metabolism and Limitless Health, that metabolic dysfunction refers to how cells make energy, right down to the mitochondria.

Diet Matters Most

Dr. Means rates a proper diet as the best way to avoid metabolic dysfunction or reverse it. Other habits, like exercise and sleep, also play a role, but she says diet matters most. She believes if more doctors were to take ""an ultra-aggressive stance on diet"" with patients, many could avoid medications and surgery. However, with the current system in place, that's unlikely to happen.

""The average medical student in the United States does not take a single class in nutrition in medical school,"" Dr. Means said. ""Four years of medical school, three to seven years of residency, and we are not talking about nutrition or lifestyle virtually at all. So there's this huge mismatch between what's causing diseases and then what doctors are trained to understand and treat.""

After nine years, Dr. Means switched from surgery to functional medicine, one of the few specialties that emphasized healthy habits.

""It's a lot harder to counsel a patient for an hour on their lifestyle and their diet than send them with a prescription for a pill,"" Dr. Means said.

Avoid Processed Foods

Dr. Means says her top diet recommendation involves avoiding processed foods, which are found in packages and in many restaurants.

""Seventy percent of the calories we're eating in the United States today are ultra-processed foods made in factories,"" she said. ""Essentially we should think of ultra-processed food as a recent experiment in human culture that has failed. We know that ultra-processed foods drive diseases in children, in infants, in adults and the elderly.""

She advises people to eat food close to what's found in nature and ideally cooked at home.

""We've got to focus on the freshest, cleanest, unprocessed, whole foods as possible,"" she said.

Dr. Means recommends avoiding processed oils, such as soybean, vegetable, canola, shortening, peanut, safflower, and sunflower. She recommends consuming olive oil because it's rich in polyphenols, compounds that help protect against oxidative stress and inflammation. She also recommends avocado oil, and organic coconut oil.

As a child Hernandez was a migrant farm worker, toiling in fields in California alongside his Mexican parents and siblings. That hard labor fueled his big dreams of becoming an astronaut. And he never gave up on those dreams, even as NASA turned him down nearly a dozen times.

Now, his inspiring journey from rejection to acceptance has become a feature film called ""A Million Miles Away.""

Hernandez shared his inspiration to travel to outer space with CBN News' Studio 5.

""The stars always attracted me. When I was a kid, Star Trek, the first run series, was coming on, with Captain Kirk. Then when we would go out in the field, we would go away from the pollution of light of the city. It was still dark and man you can see constellations up above,"" he said.

""When I was a 10-year-old, I see on the black and white TV, the very last Apollo mission, Apollo 17, Gene Cernan, walking on the moon. That is when it hit me. I was like, 'I want to be like that guy. I want to go to outer space.' I told my dad, and my dad did something incredible. He only has a third-grade education, but he had the wisdom to empower me to believe it because he told me, 'I think you can do it.' As a 10-year-old, I never looked back. As I grew up, I just add perseverance,"" he continued.

Hernandez described his personal path to perseverance.

""I always tell people when you select something that you are going after, make sure you enjoy the journey because that is about 80 to 90% of your effort. So I was enjoying the journey,"" he told CBN News.

Faith also played a major role in Hernandez's life.



""A lot of people always argue with me and say, 'Isn't that a contradiction in life, science and religion?' and I say no. Quite the contrary. Science explains how things work. Religion explains why things happen. Not how things happen, but why they happen. And so it fills you spiritually as to why things happen. So, I think they go hand in hand,"" he told CBN News.

Many are now enjoying seeing his story on the big and small screens.

""It's kind of like I opened the door of my house to the public and they are all watching me now. I think it's good in the sense that I want people to see my story to understand where I came from that they get empowered to say that if he had it that bad and he was able to accomplish this, then why can't I accomplish my own goals,"" he said.

As a devoted father of five children, he is building a legacy they can model.

""My oldest four weeks ago, graduated from Purdue in Aerospace Engineering with a PhD. I asked him why Purdue. He said, 'Did you know that Purdue graduates the most Astronauts?' That's how he told me he wants to be an astronaut,"" he continued.

As Jose supports his son's space dreams, he's also back on the farm working alongside his dad in the vineyard their family owns.

""A Million Miles Away"" is streaming on the Amazon Prime platform.

Listen to the latest episode of “Quick Start”

The baptisms were part of an event series known as PNG for Christ, with initial estimates apparently accounting for only a portion of the total baptisms that took place, Adventist Today reported.

The outlet went on to say the PNG for Christ campaign is a joint Seventh-day Adventist effort of the Papua New Guinea Union Mission (PNGUM), the General Conference, and Adventist World Radio, among others.

The effort was reportedly a two-week campaign tour featuring Pastor Ted Wilson, president of the Seventh-day Adventist world church. He and his wife, Nancy, spoke at daily events as the crusade traveled around Papua New Guinea to share the Gospel.

Wilson released a May 19 statement on Facebook detailing some of the incredible baptism numbers that reportedly took place during these events.

“The latest information from the South Pacific Division and the Papua New Guinea Union Mission is that 278,369 people have been baptized so far in ‘PNG for Christ’ with only about 52% of the over 2000 sites reporting,” he wrote. “This is a miracle of God! Many more will be reported.”

He followed up that announcement a week later, revealing that more than 300,000 had been baptized as reports continued to come in from around the country.

Wilson said the PNG effort carefully instructed people in biblical truth to help them understand the Gospel. He went on to say the baptisms were evidence of the “Holy Spirit power being poured out on Papua New Guinea.”

Just days before Wilson’s post, Adventist Record stated in a May 14 article that, with official numbers still being counted, the total baptismal count was already at 260,000.

With so many being immersed, some pools had to be made to accommodate up to 1,000 people — an incredible feat that shows the depths of new believers’ desire to express their faith.

The impact of PNG for Christ on individual hearts was apparently sweeping, with the Adventist Record noting reports of “drug lords burning their marijuana crops and being baptised, prisoners responding to calls, whole villages declaring themselves Adventist, healings and people understanding the Gospel presentations in their own languages.”

PNG for Christ was coordinated by Pastor Miller Kuso, personal ministry director for PNGUM. He oversaw 2,000 sites where events were held throughout the country, including in some remote areas.

“It is a great privilege and honor for me to visit different sites right across our country,” he told the Adventist Record. “I would like to thank [the almost 300 international speakers] for standing together, as a movement, with PNGUM to deliver the message of hope, the message of salvation to the people of this great nation of Papua New Guinea.”

Be sure to pray for the hundreds of thousands who were reportedly baptized during PNG for Christ and for the many leaders helping disciple people who are leaving behind other religious and faith systems to begin new and vibrant relationships with Christ.

CBN News has reached out to the Seventh-day Adventist world church to confirm final baptism numbers and will update the story when we hear back.

The Department of Homeland Security is searching for hundreds of ISIS-related ""subjects of concern"" who crossed the southern U.S. border illegally.

The DHS says more than 400 migrants came into the U.S. from Central Asia through a smuggling network affiliated with the Islamic terrorist group referred to as ISIS. Only about 150 have been arrested while others are reportedly being tracked across 17 states.

However, the whereabouts of more than 50 of those suspects are unknown.

Most of the ISIS-connected individuals who crossed the border were allowed to stay because they were not on a terrorism watch list, according to NBC News.

House Committee on Homeland Security Chairman Mark E. Green, MD (R-TN) recently released a statement saying, ""Almost weekly we are getting reports that someone with terrorist ties or other major criminal connections has been released into our country by the Biden administration and allowed to roam free for months or even years.""

""It's only a matter of time before one of these individuals connected to a terrorist group is involved in something devastating on U.S. soil, and this administration will be responsible. How much longer will we let this madness continue?"" Green asked.

Recent attacks in Russia, such as this weekend's assault on churches and synagogues in the republic of Dagestan, have raised concerns about the terror group ISIS and its offshoots spreading abroad.

Earlier this month, federal agents revealed they had arrested eight people in several U.S. cities with alleged ties to ISIS.

Federal agencies released a joint statement saying, ""The individuals arrested are detained in ICE custody pending removal proceedings … The FBI and DHS will continue working around the clock with our partners to identify, investigate, and disrupt potential threats to national security.""

Lead Pastor Cole Bailey reflects on those challenging days with gratitude for CBN's Operation Blessing, praising it as a powerful, life-changing force for good.



Scars from Hurricane Michael are still visible in Panama City Beach. Where the former Lighthouse Church building once stood, now there's just a mere concrete slab that once supported a thriving congregation.



""When you're in Florida, a Category 3 hurricane might not worry you – but when it escalated to a five, we knew it was serious and we evacuated,"" said Pastor Bailey.



The first Category 5 storm to strike Florida's Panhandle, Michael became the most powerful hurricane to make landfall in the U.S. It claimed 59 lives and caused an estimated $25 billion in damage.



After 24 years of serving this community, Lighthouse Church lost its entire physical site to Hurricane Michael except for the ground it once stood on. The church's foundation in faith, however, remained unshaken.

Pastor Cole Bailey, an Air Force veteran, brought his military experience to bear when Hurricane Michael devastated Panama City Beach. As pastor of Lighthouse Church, his leadership was instrumental in organizing the community and coordinating relief efforts. He vividly recounted the pivotal moment when a helicopter from CBN's Operation Blessing landed at their ravaged property, bringing much-needed aid and volunteers to help restore hope and order.



""I get a call from someone from Operation Blessing and they said, 'We're looking for a church to partner with, someone in the area where we can come in, we can set up operations and begin to do what we do,'"" Pastor Bailey recounted. ""And I said, 'I'm your guy, I'm your guy.' And they said, 'Okay, can we land a helicopter in your parking lot?' And I was like, 'Come on, bring that helicopter here!' And I start telling everybody else like, 'Okay, Operation Blessing from CBN, they're bringing a chopper in, y'all, right now. They're on their way in.' And whenever that helicopter landed, we met a man named Tom. Tom got off that chopper, man. He shook my hand, and we walked around, and he said, 'Can we set up here?' And I'm like, 'Our place is your place. Do anything you want to do. I mean, we're so, so thankful that you're here.' And they came in and just brought peace to chaos.""



Volunteers brought chainsaws, hot meals, and a spirit of perseverance. Pastor Bailey saw it as the power of faith in action.

""They came in with resources that blew our minds,"" said Bailey. ""They came in with hundreds of volunteers just at one location. We were able to serve 38,000 hot meals after that storm. Resources are coming in, equipment is coming.""

Stephanie Robinson has been a part of Lighthouse since it started in 2000.

""I knew God was going to move, but it's hard to see in that, you know, that devastating time of just everything that God had kind of built, just plummeting,"" said Robinson. ""But it was amazing to watch the community of God just immediately step in.""

Despite the storm, Stephanie says the church found its true strength in the faith of its people. Today, the new building stands in a renovated movie theater across the bridge in Panama City.

""And it's a beautiful picture of God taking the destruction and bringing something out of the ashes really, and truly just exploding here,"" said Robinson.

Pastor Bailey mentioned the church is experiencing significant growth, with multiple services each week, and they currently do not have enough chairs to accommodate everyone attending. He highlighted that they have 1,300 people participating in small groups weekly.

""But this church right here is so thankful for when Operation Blessing landed on our property and helped us through the hardest time of our lives,"" said Pastor Bailey. ""I cannot express how life-changing and how powerful that ministry is.""

Less than five months from the presidential election, state officials are busy preparing for the voting process. According to one survey, a vast majority have increased security since 2020, hoping to ensure results can be trusted.

The Pentagon is reaching out to higher education for help, enlisting research teams from two Maryland universities. Their task: a three-year risk assessment focused specifically on the vulnerabilities of voting machines.

""We are looking at all the things that could possibly go wrong. Those could be an actor trying to disrupt something, maybe...trying to break a machine or trying to back vote for somebody who's dead, or things like that. But they could also be honest mistakes,"" Dr. Natalie Scala of Towson University told CBN News.

Scala, the co-director of the Empowering Secure Elections Lab at Towson, says this is the perfect assignment for academia, rather than government officials to tackle.

""For academics, we look at it based purely on data,"" Scala explained. ""So we don't necessarily have a favorite candidate. We don't necessarily have an agenda to push. We just want that vote to stay the way it is, from the moment somebody casts it to the moment we count it, we want nothing to happen there. And what can we do to make sure that that happens, that that integrity stays there, so the American people can have their votes counted.""

The project's focus involves optical scanners, used by 70 percent of voters, and ballot marking devices, used by the remaining 30 percent.

""We are looking at it from the, you know, America like the average American standpoint and making sure that you feel confident and secure in the processes that we have,"" Scala said.

In the past, her lab provided training for Maryland poll workers, a project she says will add to their current research.

""We don't want poll workers to make honest mistakes, and those mistakes become risks, you know, or problems. And we also want poll workers to be able to identify if something is going wrong,"" Scala said.

This is the first of the lab's three-year Pentagon grant. The team will consider cyber, physical, and insider threats. An overall approach, that will hopefully result in protecting other critical infrastructure, like the power grid.

The presumptive Republican presidential nominee told a crowd gathered in Philadelphia Saturday he is denying the Rev. Franklin Graham’s suggestion he avoid using course language during his speeches, essentially because it makes his addresses less interesting.

In a clip shared on X, Trump praised Graham as a “man I like” and described him as someone he admires before recalling a letter the evangelist — the son of the late Billy Graham — wrote, in which he asked the brash politician to stop using “foul language” on his campaign stops.

At a rally in Philadelphia, Trump tells crowd that Franklin Graham wrote him a letter telling him his speeches would be better if he didn’t use “foul language.” Trump says Graham is “wrong!” @Franklin_Graham #trump pic.twitter.com/1zfMKpL9a3 — Jesse Jackson (@JesseTJackson) June 23, 2024

“He said, ‘President, I love your speaking. Your ability to speak is incredible. Your storytelling is great, but it could be so much better if you didn’t use foul language,'” Trump recalled of the note from Graham, before responding to his request, saying, “He’s wrong.”

While Trump claimed he has been working “so hard” to avoid course language during his speeches, he said the lengths of his monologues — which often run between one and two hours — make it very difficult for him to completely eliminate swearing from his vocabulary.

He requested Graham allow him “one or two” curse words, because “if you don’t, you don’t get the emphasis.”

Listen to the latest episode of “Quick Start”

To show he has made a good-faith effort, the former president noted a recent speech he delivered over the weekend at the Faith and Freedom Coalition’s Road to Majority Conference, a gathering of Christian political activists in Washington, D.C.

Trump said, “I was really good. I didn’t interject. Could have been better if I used a couple of bad words.”

The likely Republican presidential nominee, though, did acknowledge one scenario in which he would stop using bad words altogether: “When I see people start to walk out, then we’ll stop.”

“I’m not going to use the word bull****,” Trump stated, saying the full curse word without censoring himself, going on to claim it’s “not that bad a word.”

As for Graham, he told The Wall Street Journal earlier this year he does not officially endorse political candidates. The evangelist has nonetheless become a stalwart supporter of the former president.

In 2021, for example, 10 Republican lawmakers sided with Democrats in the U.S. House of Representatives in voting to impeach Trump over the rioting inside the U.S. Capitol. Graham compared those GOP legislators to Judas Iscariot, the wayward disciple who betrayed Jesus to the Roman authorities for 30 pieces of silver — a sinful decision that set into motion Jesus’ crucifixion.

“These ten, from [Trump’s] own party, joined in the feeding frenzy,” Graham wrote in a Facebook post at the time. “It makes you wonder what the thirty pieces of silver were that Speaker [Nancy] Pelosi promised for this betrayal.”

News of the language-based request from Graham comes as the Samaritan’s Purse and Billy Graham Evangelistic Association president launched a new fund for Christians facing religious liberty challenges in the United Kingdom.

“There are so many problems in our society, and people are looking for hope,” he said in a statement shared with CBN News. “We know that true hope can only be found in Jesus Christ, so we need to support one another in getting the Good News of Jesus Christ out — whatever it takes.”

As the Jewish state is simply looking to protect its people from daily rocket attacks, the U.S. is pushing for a diplomatic solution to the fighting between Lebanon-based Hezbollah and Israel before it turns into a full-blown war. Meanwhile, Israel's Supreme Court ruling Tuesday concerning the drafting of ultra-Orthodox men could also pose problems for Netanyahu's government.

U.S. Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin warned Hezbollah that Washington can't stop Israel from going to war to prevent the terror group's daily attacks on the north.

""Hezbollah's provocations threaten to drag the Israeli and Lebanese people into a war that they do not want,"" Austin said Tuesday. ""And such a war would be a catastrophe for Lebanon, and it would be devastating for innocent Israeli and Lebanese civilians.""

Still, Austin is urging Israel's visiting Defense Minister Yoav Gallant to seek a diplomatic solution.

""Another war between Israel and Hezbollah could easily become a regional war, with terrible consequences for the Middle East. And so, diplomacy is by far the best way to prevent more escalation,"" Austin stated.

Yoav Gallant says Israel is determined to establish security in the north and bring back some 80,000 citizens evacuated from their homes. He asked the U.S. to focus on heading off a larger threat: Iran getting nuclear weapons.

""The greatest threat to the future of the world and the future of our region is Iran. And time is running out,"" Gallant insisted.

In Israel itself, the Supreme Court ruled that ultra-Orthodox young men must now serve in the military. The community, which has 65,000 young men, has been exempt from the military draft since 1948 when Israel's first prime minister allowed 400 students to study full-time as a spiritual blessing to the state.

Former Knesset Member Dov Lipman, now the CEO of a group that helps immigrants, noted the exemption for the ultra-Orthodox posed a problem for secular Israelis. ""And broader Israel said that there needs to be equality,"" he told CBN News. How can there be tens of thousands who are being exempted from military service when everyone else is serving? Lipman explained the coalition partners with Netanyahu's Likud Party are ultra-Orthodox, and they don't want their people drafted. ""The Supreme Court ruling is (that) everyone gets drafted until you cover the law that shows equality. Everyone gets drafted. There's no way these ultra-Orthodox parties can stay in a government where that's the government policy – and that could collapse the government and lead to a new election,"" Lipman said.

And in a New York political campaign where Israel was a point of contention, Congressman Jamaal Bowman, a member of the Progressive “Squad” lost his primary race this week to moderate Democrat George Latimer. Bowman’s opposition to Israel was a key issue in the first loss for the Squad since it was formed 6 years ago.

Fortune,https://fortune.com/europe/2024/07/01/commute-4-hours-day-pandemic-style-suburban-life-trainline/,2024-07-01,12:34:27 UTC,Trainline: Workers would rather commute 4 hours than live near office,"During the pandemic, an exodus of professionals left their urban jungle flats for sprawling suburban homes in more scenic rural areas—and now despite cities bouncing back and offices reopening, they’d rather commute for hours on end on a train (or plane) than give up their newfound life on the outskirts.

New research by Trainline shows that the number of people in the U.K. spending more than 3 hours getting to work and back—otherwise known as, “super commuting”—has doubled since before the pandemic.

Although super commuters are defined as those with journeys to work of least 90 minutes one-way, the train ticket platform found that most actually spend at least 2 hours traveling in each direction.

Perhaps surprisingly, most super commuters aren’t those lucky few who only have to show face in the office once in a blue moon.

Most professionals who moved far from the office during the pandemic say they have hybrid working to thank (or blame) for their new commuting habit and for being able to keep their after-work country lifestyle.

On average, super commuters are heading into the office three days a week and as a result, wasting at least 12 hours—more than an entire work day—on a train each week, just to sit at their desks.

Yet despite having less time to actually enjoy their suburban life than those living close to the office, three-quarters of super commuters said they are happier for it, and over a third reported enjoying a better work-life balance.

Others admitted that the hefty journey is worth it for their reduced cost of living on the outskirts.

Super commuting is a global phenomenon

Super commuting isn’t a U.K.-specific trend. Across the pond in the States, the mean distance to work rose from 10 miles in 2019 to 27 miles at the end of 2023, according to a study from payroll processing and HR services company Gusto.

According to their data, millennials—who are mostly in their thirties and settling down—live the farthest away from their employer.

Take hairstylist Katlin Jay: The 30-year-old travels 650 miles on a plane from Charlotte, N.C. to New York on a biweekly basis.

But, she told New York Post that she is paying less money on travel (at around $1,000 a month) than she would on rent if she lived near her Upper West side job.

Meanwhile, even in Germany, a 32-year-old director is flying across the continent to London for work to get the best of both worlds. However, to those enticed by Seb’s way of life, he warned in Business Insider that the 5-hour commute won’t be sustainable in the long run.

But be warned: You may be asked to move back

Even now that it’s clear most companies will require their workers in the office for part of the week—and having undoubtedly heard their colleagues complain about their long commute—Trainline’s research found that over half of city-living workers are eyeing up the super commute club.

Why? Just like current super commuters, most think it’ll improve their work-life balance.

“Hybrid working has helped fundamentally shift work and travel habits over the past few years, with more people now choosing a longer commute so they can both live and work where they want,” Sakshi Anand, VP of growth at Trainline, said.

“Our research shows that not only are these rail super commuters on the rise, but that the phenomenon is here to stay.”

But beware: Bosses could ask you to choose between the office or your life on the outskirts.

Just last week, Patagonia told its remote customer service employees that they must now live within 60 miles of one of seven “hubs” in Atlanta, Salt Lake City, Reno, Dallas, Austin, Chicago, or Pittsburgh.

The sustainable outdoors brand gave around 90 workers the ultimatum: relocate or quit.

Likewise, last year TikTok warned U.S. workers whose home addresses aren’t in the vicinity of its office, that they could lose their jobs if they don’t relocate.","Although super commuters are defined as those with journeys to work of least 90 minutes one-way, the train ticket platform found that most actually spend at least 2 hours traveling in each direction.

Fortune,https://fortune.com/2024/07/01/canadas-westjet-deal-end-mechanics-union-strike-disruptions-canceled-829-flights-continue/,2024-07-01,11:40:04 UTC,Canada's WestJet reaches deal to end mechanics union strike,"Canada’s second largest airline, WestJet, has reached a deal with its mechanics to end a strike that had disrupted the travel plans of tens of thousands of passengers over the Canada Day long weekend.

WestJet said late Sunday there will still be flight disruptions in the week ahead as its planes are brought back into service.

In its own news release, the Airplane Mechanics Fraternal Association urged its members to return to work immediately pending a vote on the temporary agreement.

Some 680 workers, whose daily inspections and repairs are essential to airline operations, had walked off the job on Friday evening despite a directive for binding arbitration from the labor minister.

Since Thursday, WestJet has canceled 829 flights scheduled between then and Monday in the busiest travel weekend of the season in Canada.

The vast majority of Sunday’s trips were called off as WestJet pared down its 180-plane fleet to 32 active aircraft and topped the global list for cancellations among major airlines over the weekend.

“The damage to Canadians and our airline is massive, a swift resolution was necessary; we take no victory laps on this outcome but will sleep better tonight knowing further harm has been prevented,” Diederik Pen, President of WestJet Airlines and Group Chief Operating Officer, said in a statement.

“We will see no further labor action coming out of this dispute, as both parties agree to arbitrate the contract in the case of a failed ratification.”

Details of the agreement were not immediately available.

The union had previously said its demands around wages would cost WestJet less than $8 million Canadian (US$5.6 million) beyond what the company has offered for the first year of the collective agreement — the first contract between the two sides. It has acknowledged the gains would surpass compensation for industry colleagues across Canada and sit more on par with U.S. counterparts.

WestJet had said it has offered a 12.5% wage hike in the first year of the contract, and a compounded wage increase of 23.5% over the rest of the 5 1/2-year term.","Canada’s second largest airline, WestJet, has reached a deal with its mechanics to end a strike that had disrupted the travel plans of tens of thousands of passengers over the Canada Day long weekend.

Fortune,https://fortune.com/asia/2024/07/01/chinas-factory-slowdown-pmi-new-export-orders-eu-us-ev-tariffs/,2024-07-01,11:19:23 UTC,China factory slowdown continues as new export orders falter,"Surveys of Chinese factory managers showed a mixed outlook for the world’s second-largest economy in June, with growth steady but not picking up much steam.

The China Federation of Logistics and Purchasing’s official purchasing managers index, or PMI, remained at 49.5, the same as in May, on a scale up to 100 where 50 marks the cut off for expansion.

“From the perspective of output, China’s economy is maintaining expansion, but the momentum of recovery still needs to be consolidated,” the official Xinhua News Agency cited Zhao Qinghe, senior statistician for the National Bureau of Statistics, as saying.

The PMI for new export orders slipped to 49.4 from 49.6, perhaps reflecting announcements by the European Union and United States of plans to increase their tariffs on imports of electric vehicles from China.

A private-sector survey released Monday by the financial media group Caixin was more optimistic, edging up to 51.8 from 51.7 in the previous month. That was the fastest expansion of factory output in two years, it said. Analysts had forecast that it would fall.

But while sentiment was positive, the level of confidence among purchasing managers fell to the lowest in over four-and-a-half years due to worries over intense competition and uncertain market conditions, Caixin said.

The surveys offered scant insight into whether various measures to boost the property sector, such as cutting mortgage interest rates and down payments, have had much impact on an industrywide slump that followed a crackdown on excessive borrowing by developers.

“The PMIs for June were mixed but on balance suggest that the recovery lost some momentum last month,” Capital Economics said in a report.

The official PMI reading for high-tech manufacturing rose to 52.3 in June from 50.7 in May, reflecting the government’s drive to boost investment in upgrading factories and equipment in new industries such as computer chip and electric vehicles.

“This shows that the transformation and upgrading of China’s manufacturing industry has continued to advance,” Zhao was quoted as saying.

Chinese leader Xi Jinping has made growth of such advanced industries a top priority, a theme likely to dominate an upcoming meeting of top officials of the ruling Communist Party when they meet later in the month.

Xinhua said in a separate report that during the meeting the party would disclose a new round of “deep and comprehensive reforms.”

Such measures will “chart the course forward for the world’s second largest economy,” it said.","Surveys of Chinese factory managers showed a mixed outlook for the world’s second-largest economy in June, with growth steady but not picking up much steam.

Fortune,https://fortune.com/europe/2024/07/01/europeans-vacation-deprivation-working-less-time-off-america-japan-expedia/,2024-07-01,11:02:19 UTC,"Europeans suffer from ‘vacation deprivation,’ despite working less and having more time off than their American and Japanese peers","In the eyes of many, Europe is viewed as a vacation dreamland, with its liberal holiday allowances and a culture that heavily promotes work-life balance.

But if you ask Europeans, they might disagree. As far as they are concerned, they’re not getting nearly enough vacation days—even as they’re getting the most among some of their peers, a new Expedia report shows.

Germans and French have among the most generous annual leave periods, with 31 and 33 days, respectively. That’s over a month in both cases—two-and-a-half times the number of days the U.S. employees get. Yet, a survey of over 11,500 employees worldwide revealed that workers in Germany and France report not having enough vacation time.

In contrast, their American and Japanese peers take significantly fewer days off work and seem largely satisfied with it. While 65% of U.S. and 53% of Japanese employees feel deprived of a vacation, that figure climbs to 84% among Germans and 69% for the French.

More time off certainly doesn’t address the larger question of work-life balance, as some European employees are left wanting more. But what explains this divergence?

It turns out that people’s attitudes toward vacation and its place in each country’s culture dictate why they feel deprived of their downtime.

If you consider the U.S., employees work longer hours, according to OECD data. In 2022, the average worker spent 1,811 hours working through the year compared to 1,341 hours and 1,511 hours in Germany and France, respectively.

Call it what you will, whether that’s ambition—or its lack thereof, as the Norwegian sovereign wealth fund CEO Nicolai Tangen said in April, it’s what distinguishes the workers’ attitudes.

“Particularly in America, there’s an ‘ideal worker’ norm, and we feel pressure to look committed to the job at all times,” Dr. Mindy Shoss, a professor of psychology at the University of Central Florida, said to Expedia. The reason Americans cited for not taking enough time off was “life is too busy to plan or go on vacation,” the travel company’s 24th iteration of the “Vacation Deprivation” report found.

On the contrary, vacations are seen as a “basic right” in France, Christie Hudson, Expedia’s head of public relations, told Fortune last month. They’re also seen as a crucial aspect of overall well-being, which isn’t valid to the same extent in the U.S.

“The distinctly French emphasis on the fundamental right to rest is one to adopt everywhere,” the Expedia report said.

What gives?

France has become known as one of the least workaholic nations, with many people taking time off and working fewer hours.

However, more generally, studies have found that European culture accommodates work-life balance more than the U.S. Countries like the U.K. have a statutory requirement entitling workers to 28 days off.

The approach is straightforward for Europeans: As long as people meet the subsistence level, they choose free time over wealth creation, unlike their American counterparts who prioritize the opposite, the Financial Times reported.

Even when Americans choose to take vacations, rest and relaxation are often not a priority, making it harder to unplug. This explains the desire for more time off.

If we widen our gaze further, countries like Hong Kong and Japan offer unique lessons on how best to utilize the time workers get—whether that’s a little or a lot.

Hong Kong-based workers systematically plan their time off, often around public holidays, to maximize their vacations. That’s how they have no leftover days on average, and the same is true of Singapore.

In Japan, where workers get roughly 19 days off a year, seven days go unused, according to Expedia. Still, Japanese employees feel the least deprived of vacations. The trick? Taking short, but frequent breaks between work to make the most of time off.

“In Japan, people take time off every month instead of just twice a year. For the French, not even a full month of vacation feels like enough time,” Melanie Fish, Expedia brands public relations head said.

“Clearly there’s a lot for the U.S. to borrow from, whether it’s spreading your PTO throughout the year or prioritizing rest on your next vacation.”","As far as they are concerned, they’re not getting nearly enough vacation days—even as they’re getting the most among some of their peers, a new Expedia report shows.

Fortune,https://fortune.com/2024/07/01/youtube-philanthropist-mrbeast-jimmy-donaldson-donations/,2024-07-01,10:56:25 UTC,"YouTube star and philanthropist MrBeast says ‘ideally’ governments, not content creators, should build homes and cure blindness—but he won’t ‘stand by and do nothing’","Jimmy Donaldson has in the past been criticized for using the $700 million fortune amassed by his work on YouTube to right social inequalities. But the 26-year-old, who goes by the online moniker ‘MrBeast’ has a question: what would you have him do instead?

The creator posted on X this week about the backlash he has received on videos such as ‘I built 100 homes and gave them away’ and ‘1,000 blind people see for the first time.’

But the content creator—who has launched a philanthropic arm to his brand—is determined to keep up the work in the same vain as many high net worth individuals before him.

Posting on the Elon Musk-owned social media platform formerly known as Twitter, Donaldson wrote on Sunday: “When we help people (curing 1,000 blind people, building 100 houses, 100 wells, etc) people get mad and say I shouldn’t be doing this and governments should.

“Yes, ideally a YouTuber isn’t the one fixing these issues but I’m not just gonna stand by and do nothing.”

MrBeast’s blindness video, posted on Jan. 28, 2023, sparked a debate about the ethics of influencers making content about philanthropic deeds. Donaldson was accused of “making content out of people who can’t see.” Others added: “Now you have to be filmed for a YouTube video to get vision.”

The influencer, who sleeps in his North Carolina studio to cut down on driving time to the office, hit back in February 2023. Again posting on X, he wrote: “Twitter – Rich people should help others with their money.

“Me – Okay, I’ll use my money to help people and I promise to give away all my money before I die. Every single penny.

“Twitter – MrBeast bad.”

Me – Okay, I’ll use my money to help people and I promise to give away all my money before I die. Every single penny.

Even Donaldson, who has grown his business empire with the likes of a burger brand ‘MrBeast Burgers’ and snacking brand ‘Feastables’, has questioned before why individuals are stepping in to bridge inequalities that should, in theory, be addressed by governments.

“I don’t understand why curable blindness is a thing,” Mr Beast wrote on X. “Why don’t governments step in and help? Even if you’re thinking purely from a financial standpoint it’s hard to see how they don’t ROI on taxes from people being able to work again.”

Government and philanthropy

The confusion Donaldson experienced was encountered by another famous pair of philanthropists when they began their foundation: Bill and Melinda Gates.

The Microsoft co-founder wrote that in 1993 when the entrepreneur and his then-wife first visited Africa they assumed that “if millions of children were dying, there would be massive worldwide effort to save them.” The deaths of these children occurred because of a range of reasons: measles, malaria, hepatitis B, yellow fever and rotavirus—a diarrhea and vomiting sickness which many children in the western world are vaccinated against.

“But we were wrong,” wrote the tech titan on his blog, GatesNotes, in 2012.

The man worth $157 billion per the Bloomberg Billionaire’s Index wrote that governments face a range of obstacles when it comes to funding the innovation needed to beat such inequalities. These range from being risk adverse to having a short-term lens prompted by election cycles.

On top of that, the father-of-three wrote the private sector will only invest so much in such innovations because businesses would shoulder all the risk while benefitting from a diminished level of returns.

“So when you come to the end of the innovations that business and government are willing to invest in, you still find a vast, unexplored space of innovation where the returns can be fantastic. This space is a fertile area for what I call catalytic philanthropy,” he explained.

“The investor doesn’t need a share of the benefits—those go to poor people, or sick people or society generally, all of whom stand to gain earth-shaking returns from the kind of innovations that business and government likely won’t pursue unless philanthropy goes first. And once you’ve found a solution that works, catalytic philanthropy can harness political and market forces to get those innovations to the people who need them most.”","Jimmy Donaldson has in the past been criticized for using the $700 million fortune amassed by his work on YouTube to right social inequalities.

Fortune,https://fortune.com/2024/07/01/gen-zers-disillusioned-economy-ok-commit-fraud/,2024-07-01,10:14:19 UTC,Gen Zers are so disillusioned with the economy that they think it’s OK to commit fraud,"Each quarter, my company Sift produces an index report to better understand the latest online fraud trends, including how businesses and consumers are affected, emerging fraud tactics, and how fraud impacts consumer behavior when making purchases online. For the past two quarters, we’ve seen a surprising generational divide emerge: Gen Z— born between 1997 and 2012—expresses more willingness than any other generation to commit digital fraud.

In Q4 2023, 42% of Gen Zers admitted a willingness to engage in first-party fraud, where they dispute a purchase with their payment provider despite the purchase being legitimate. This was significantly higher than any other generation—the next highest was millennials, with only 22% admitting to engaging in first-party fraud. This quarter, we discovered that 33% of Gen Z respondents either know someone who has participated in payment fraud or have done so themselves. Again, these rates are much higher than other generations.

This data might seem sensational, but if we explore it more deeply, it’s very telling. Academics have a theory called the “fraud triangle,” which argues that people are more inclined to commit fraud if they have incentive, rationalization, and opportunity.

Gen Z is facing persistent and diverse financial challenges

Gen Z has a number of unfortunate economic factors to feel anxious about. A survey from Intuit found that 73% of Zoomers feel that the current economic environment has made it more challenging to save money. They’re struggling with increased housing costs, student loan debt, and rising prices on everyday purchases like groceries, all while wages have stagnated for workers across many income levels.

These factors snowball into a financially stressful situation that makes it more challenging to afford day-to-day necessities. Unsurprisingly, more economic anxiety can inspire people to look for tactics to stretch every dollar. For most, this behavior is innocuous: clipping coupons, switching from name-brand to generic items, or shopping secondhand. In fact, Gen Z is also the most likely to shop for secondhand items online, with 42% of this generation purchasing a resale item in the past year.

But facing the wrong set of circumstances, some people will turn to stolen payment methods or chargebacks to get more with less. In these situations, consumers may rationalize fraudulent behavior by convincing themselves that their actions are necessary or justified given the economic environment. They may view their actions as a temporary solution, or even as a moral gray area with few consequences to anyone.

They approach brand loyalty differently

Gen Z may see large corporations as a cause for these broader economic challenges, making them less likely to view stealing from them as immoral. They may see this behavior as a victimless crime, as the companies they are transacting with are often industry behemoths.

They also have less loyalty to legacy brands compared to earlier generations. Name recognition alone is not enough to compel Gen Zers to make a purchase. Increasingly, they are looking for “dupes” as a way to save money, prioritizing cheaper goods and services over premium brands. This spans all types of purchases, from clothing and accessories to beauty and personal care products. They’re also more willing to try new brands and are less swayed by established names and celebrity endorsements.

This mentality extends beyond the businesses they buy from. Gen Zers also prioritize spending flexibility and are more drawn to monthly subscriptions or sharing services that allow access without the commitment of ownership, from car-sharing to video streaming to product subscriptions.

With that desire for unlimited access to goods and services, comes a natural drive to maintain that access, which could make shoppers more inclined to turn to nefarious means to do so. The logic is that a company will most likely notice if you’re stealing a car or TV—but the risk is far less likely with a $6.99 monthly subscription.

They’re digitally native

Gen Z is more heavily influenced by social media and spends more time online than any other generation, allowing online trends to dictate what they buy and how they get their news.

Their time on social media also exposes them to more fraud. Harkening back to iconic online grifters like Anna Delvey and Fyre Fest, there’s a newer category of influencers that’s promoting more outright fraud, selling step-by-step guides that detail how to hack into accounts or make purchases with stolen payment methods. Sift data finds that 34% of Gen Zers have seen offers to take part in online fraud, compared to only 9% of baby boomers. That exposure to social media content is another key reason why Gen Z is more likely to commit fraud—and highlights the deep influence of social media on consumer behaviors.

This generation’s unique challenges and perspectives create the need for a nuanced approach from businesses, one that addresses their economic anxieties, adapts to their consumer habits, and engages with them where they are online.

Some proven approaches include:

Emphasizing authenticity and social responsibility. This helps consumers feel a deeper emotional connection to a brand and prevents them from treating it like a faceless entity.

to minimize returns fraud and give shoppers more peace of mind. Prioritizing responsive customer service and offering refunds or alternatives promptly so shoppers don’t turn to chargebacks to address any issues.

The willingness of Gen Z to engage in online fraud is a reflection of the complex interplay of economic pressures, changing consumer behaviors, and the influence of social media. This trend, while having a real business impact, stems from a place of financial stress, a desire for affordability, and a distinct approach to brand loyalty and consumption.

It’s essential to view these findings and recommendations not as an indictment of a generation but as a window into a group that is increasing its purchasing power, even as it faces more economic hurdles.

Fortune,https://fortune.com/2024/07/01/credit-card-gun-sales-policy-flight-california-visa-mastercard-codes-gun-store-purchases/,2024-07-01,09:35:47 UTC,"California makes Visa, Mastercard to provide codes for gun sales","Beginning Monday, a California law will require credit card networks like Visa and Mastercard to provide banks with special retail codes that can be assigned to gun stores in order to track their sales.

But new laws will do the exact opposite in Georgia, Iowa, Tennessee and Wyoming by banning the use of specific gun shop codes.

The conflicting laws highlight what has quietly emerged as one of the nation’s newest gun policy debates, dividing state capitols along familiar partisan lines.

Some Democratic lawmakers and gun-control activists hope the new retail tracking code will help financial institutions flag suspicious gun-related purchases for law enforcement agencies, potentially averting mass shootings and other crimes. Lawmakers in Colorado and New York have followed California’s lead.

“The merchant category code is the first step in the banking system saying, `Enough! We’re putting our foot down,’” said Hudson Munoz, executive director of the nonprofit advocacy group Guns Down America. “`You cannot use our system to facilitate gun crimes.’”

But many Republican lawmakers and gun-rights advocates fear the retail code could lead to unwarranted suspicion of gun buyers who have done nothing wrong. Over the past 16 months, 17 states with GOP-led legislatures have passed measures prohibiting a firearms store code or limiting its use.

“We view this as a first step by gun-control supporters to restrict the lawful commerce in firearms,” said Lawrence Keane, senior vice president of the National Shooting Sports Foundation, an industry group that backs laws blocking use of the tracking code.

The new laws add to the wide national divide on gun policy. This past week, U.S. Surgeon General Vivek Murthy declared gun violence a public health crisis, citing a rising number of firearm-related deaths, including more than 48,000 in 2022. The move was quickly criticized by the National Rifle Association.

States have dug opposing trench lines on other gun policies. On July 4, for example, Republican-led Louisiana will become the 29th state to allow residents to carry concealed guns without a permit.

By contrast, Democratic-led New Mexico this year tightened laws for people who don’t have concealed-carry permits, requiring a seven-day waiting period for gun purchases, which is more than double the three-day period for a federal background check.

States also have responded differently to recent mass shootings. In Maine, where an Army reservist killed 18 people and wounded 13 others, the Democratic-led Legislature passed a variety of new gun restrictions. Following school shootings in Iowa and Tennessee, the Republican-led legislatures there took steps that could allow more trained teachers to bring guns into classrooms.

The surge of legislation targeting firearm store category codes addresses a behind-the-scenes aspect of electronic financial transactions. The International Organization for Standardization, based in Geneva, sets thousands of voluntary standards for various fields, including category codes for all kinds of businesses, from bakeries to boat dealers to bookstores.

Those category lists are distributed by credit card networks to banks, which assign particular codes to businesses whose accounts they handle. Some credit card issuers use the category codes for customer reward points.

The codes can be used by financial institutions to help identify fraud, money laundering or unusual purchasing patterns that are reported as suspicious activities to the U.S. Treasury Department’s Financial Crimes Enforcement Network.

Banks and other depository institutions filed more than 1.8 million confidential reports in 2022 flagging more than 5.1 million suspicious activities. About 4% of annual reports lead to follow-up by law enforcement and an even smaller percentage to prosecution, according to the Bank Policy Institute, a trade group representing large banks.

Stores that sell guns have previously been grouped with other retailers in merchant category codes. Some have been classified as sporting goods stores, others as miscellaneous and specialty retail shops.

At the urging of New York-based Amalgamated Bank, which worked with gun-control groups, the International Organization for Standardization adopted a new four-digit category code for gun and ammunition shops in 2022. Major credit card networks initially said they would implement it but backed off under pressure from conservative politicians and the gun industry.

Munoz, who helped lead the effort to establish the firearms store code, noted credit cards were used to buy weapons and ammunition for some of the nation’s deadliest mass shootings.

The intent of a gun merchant code is to spot suspicious patterns, like a person with little history of gun purchases who suddenly spends large amounts at multiple gun stores in a short period. Once alerted by banks, authorities could investigate, potentially thwarting a mass shooting, Munoz said.

California’s new law requires credit card networks to make the firearms code available to banks and other financial institutions by Monday. Those entities then have several months to determine which of their business clients should be categorized as gun stores and assign them new codes by May 1.

Visa, the nation’s largest payment network, recently updated its merchant data manual to add the firearms code to comply with California’s law.

Democratic-led legislatures in Colorado and New York this year also passed firearms code mandates aligned to kick in with California’s next May.

“If there was someone suspiciously purchasing a large number of firearms, right now it would be very difficult to tell,” said California state Assemblymember Phil Ting, a Democrat who sponsored the new law. “You couldn’t tell if they were soccer balls or golf balls or basketballs.”

Even with a firearms store code, it won’t be possible to know whether a particular sale is for a rifle, storage safe or some other product such as hunting apparel.

The state laws prohibiting gun store codes have varying effective dates but typically allow state attorneys general to seek court injunctions against financial institutions using the codes, with potential fines reaching thousands of dollars.

The merchant code could lead more people to buy guns with cash instead of credit in order to protect their privacy, said Dan Eldridge, owner of Maxon Shooter’s Supplies in suburban Chicago. Though his business has yet to be recategorized, Eldridge said he already has placed an ATM in his store.

“Viewed most benignly, this code is an effort to stigmatize gun owners,” Eldridge said. “But a more worrisome concern is that this is another private sector end run around the prohibition against the federal government creating a gun registry.”

Iowa state Sen. Jason Schultz, a Republican sponsor of legislation banning the firearms code, said he feared federal agents could gain access to data about gun store purchases from financial institutions, then use that as justification to raid gun owners’ homes and infringe on their Second Amendment rights.

“States are going to have to make a choice,” he said, “whether they want to follow California or whether they’d like to support the original intent of the U.S. Constitution.”","“The merchant category code is the first step in the banking system saying, `Enough!

Fortune,https://fortune.com/2024/07/01/bidens-family-remain-race-dreadful-debate-performance-criticizing-staff/,2024-07-01,09:18:14 UTC,Biden family: remain in race despite dreadful debate,"President Joe Biden’s family used a Sunday gathering at Camp David to urge him to stay in the race and keep fighting despite his dreadful debate performance, and some members criticized how his staff prepared him for the faceoff, according to four people familiar with the discussions.

Biden spent the day sequestered with first lady Jill Biden, his children and grandchildren. It was a previously scheduled trip to the presidential retreat in Maryland for a photo shoot with Annie Leibovitz for the upcoming Democratic National Convention.

But the gathering was also an exercise in trying to figure out how to quell Democratic anxiety that has exploded following Thursday’s performance.

While his family was aware of how poorly he performed against Donald Trump, they also continue to think he’s the best person to beat the Republican presumptive nominee. They also believe he is capable of doing the job of president for another four years, according to the people who were not authorized to speak publicly about internal discussions and spoke to The Associated Press on condition of anonymity.

Among the most vocal: Jill Biden and son Hunter, whom the president has long gone to for counsel and advice. Both believe the president shouldn’t bow out when he’s down, and believe that he can come back from what they see as one subpar performance. The family questioned how he was prepared for the debate by staff and wondered if they could have done something better, the people said.

Biden’s campaign has spent the days since the debate — where he appeared raspy, trailed off, and at times gave convoluted answers — working to keep donors and surrogates on board as Democrats increasingly questioned whether he should stay in the race.

At this point in the delegate process, Biden would likely have to decide to drop out for there to be a new nominee. And the people he listens to most in the world — his wife and son — are telling him to stay in.

Even before the debate, the age of the 81-year-old Democratic president had been a liability with voters, and the prime-time faceoff appeared to reinforce the public’s deep-seated concerns before perhaps the largest audience he will have in the four months until Election Day. CNN said more than 51 million people watched the debate.

While the president was huddled with his family, prominent Democrats rallied to deliver a public show of support for his campaign on Sunday.

“I do not believe that Joe Biden has a problem leading for the next four years,” said one close ally, Democratic Rep. James Clyburn of South Carolina. “Joe Biden should continue to run on his record.”

Sen. Raphael Warnock, a Georgia Democrat and Baptist minister, said there had been “more than a few Sundays when I wish I had preached a better sermon,” relating the experience to Biden’s debate performance.

“But after the sermon was over, it was my job to embody the message, to show up for the people that I serve. And that’s what Joe Biden has been doing his entire life,” Warnock said. It was an echo of the message from other supporters that Biden had a bad debate, but a lifetime of good governance.

Warnock, like Clyburn and others, pivoted to Trump’s many falsehoods during the debate — lapses that Biden and the debate moderators often failed to fact check from the stage — including about the Jan. 6, 2021, attack on the Capitol by Trump supporters, immigration and the outcome of the 2020 election.

“Whenever his mouth was moving, he was lying,” Warnock said of Trump.

But concern simmered among some Democrats that Biden’s campaign and the Democratic National Committee were not taking seriously enough the impact of the debate.

Former Iowa Sen. Tom Harkin, who served for more than two decades with Biden in the Senate, called the debate “a disaster from which Biden cannot recover.”

Harkin suggested that Democratic senators in pivotal races and “maybe all incumbent Democratic Senators should pen a letter to Biden asking him to release his delegates and step aside so the convention can choose a new candidate,” according to an email to supporters that was obtained by The Associated Press. It was first referenced in Iowa journalist Julie Gammack’s column on Saturday, Iowa Potluck.

“This is a perilous time, and is more important than the ego or desires of Joe Biden to stay as President,” Harkin concluded.

Rep. Jamie Raskin, D-Md., described “very honest, serious and rigorous conversations taking place at every level of our party … about what to do.”

But DNC Chairman Jaime Harrison and Biden’s campaign manager, Julie Chavez Rodriguez, held a Saturday afternoon call with dozens of committee members across the country — a group of some of the most influential members of the party — where they offered a rosy assessment of the path forward and gave no opportunity for others on the call to respond with questions.

Multiple committee members on the call, most granted anonymity to talk about the private discussion, described feeling like they were being asked to ignore a serious predicament.

“There were a number of things that could have been said in addressing the situation. But we didn’t get that. We were being gaslit,” said Joe Salazar, an elected DNC member from Colorado, who was on the call.","“I do not believe that Joe Biden has a problem leading for the next four years,” said one close ally, Democratic Rep. James Clyburn of South Carolina.
And that’s what Joe Biden has been doing his entire life,” Warnock said.

“This is a perilous time, and is more important than the ego or desires of Joe Biden to stay as President,” Harkin concluded.","['bidens', 'remain', 'democratic', 'biden', 'joe', 'debate', 'members', 'dreadful', 'stay', 'campaign', 'president', 'family', 'despite', 'race']","https://fortune.com/img-assets/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/AP24181752295874-e1719825281804.jpg?resize=1200,600",False,presid joe biden 's famili use sunday gather camp david urg stay race keep fight despit dread debat perform member critic staff prepar faceoff accord four peopl familiar discuss biden spent day sequest first ladi jill biden children grandchildren previous schedul trip presidenti retreat maryland photo shoot anni leibovitz upcom democrat nation convent gather also exercis tri figur quell democrat anxieti explod follow thursday 's perform famili awar poor perform donald trump also continu think he 's best person beat republican presumpt nomine also believ capabl job presid anoth four year accord peopl author speak public intern discuss spoke associ press condit anonym among vocal jill biden son hunter presid long gone counsel advic believ presid should n't bow he 's down believ come back see one subpar perform famili question prepar debat staff wonder could done someth better peopl said biden 's campaign spent day sinc debat -- appear raspi trail off time gave convolut answer -- work keep donor surrog board democrat increas question whether stay race point deleg process biden would like decid drop new nomine peopl listen world -- wife son -- tell stay in even debat age yearold democrat presid liabil voter primetim faceoff appear reinforc public 's deepseat concern perhap largest audienc four month elect day said million peopl watch debat presid huddl famili promin democrat ralli deliv public show support campaign sunday `` i believ joe biden problem lead next four year '' said one close alli democrat rep jame clyburn south carolina `` joe biden continu run record '' sen raphael warnock georgia democrat baptist minist said `` more sunday wish preach better sermon '' relat experi biden 's debat perform `` but sermon over job embodi messag show peopl serv that 's joe biden entir life '' warnock said echo messag support biden bad debat lifetim good govern warnock like clyburn other pivot trump 's mani falsehood debat -- laps biden debat moder often fail fact check stage -- includ jan attack capitol trump support immigr outcom elect `` whenev mouth move lie '' warnock said trump concern simmer among democrat biden 's campaign democrat nation committe take serious enough impact debat former iowa sen tom harkin serv two decad biden senat call debat `` a disast biden can not recov '' harkin suggest democrat senat pivot race `` mayb incumb democrat senat pen letter biden ask releas deleg step asid convent choos new candid '' accord email support obtain associ press first referenc iowa journalist juli gammack 's column saturday iowa potluck `` this peril time import ego desir joe biden stay presid '' harkin conclud rep jami raskin dmd describ `` veri honest serious rigor convers take place everi level parti ... do '' dnc chairman jaim harrison biden 's campaign manag juli chavez rodriguez held saturday afternoon call dozen committe member across countri -- group influenti member parti -- offer rosi assess path forward gave opportun other call respond question multipl committe member call grant anonym talk privat discuss describ feel like ask ignor serious predica `` there number thing could said address situat did n't get that gaslit '' said joe salazar elect dnc member colorado call
Fortune,https://fortune.com/europe/2024/07/01/lvmh-billionaire-bernard-arnault-enters-race-to-acquire-signas-venice-hotel/,2024-07-01,09:13:00 UTC,LVMH billionaire Bernard Arnault enters race to acquire Signa's Venice hotel—with bids rising over $294 million,"Billionaire Bernard Arnault has joined the chase to purchase a storied Venice hotel, one of the trophy assets put on the market in the messy fallout from the implosion of Rene Benko’s Signa Group.

The Hotel Bauer, located on the Grand Canal, was one of the crown jewels of the Austrian mogul’s real estate empire. Despite its prime location and a history dating to 1880, the sales process has been caught up in Signa’s complex creditor entanglements.

King Street Capital Management is running the sales process, according to people familiar with the matter. Filings show that funds administered by the credit hedge fund took control of shares in a Signa company that owned Hotel Bauer in May.

The asset has attracted bids of more than €275 million ($294 million), said the people, who asked not to be identified as the information is private. The process is competitive and includes property firms and other investors, meaning there’s no guarantee that Arnault — the founder of LVMH Moët Hennessy Louis Vuitton SE — will get the nod, several people said.

King Street appointed real estate investment bank Eastdil Secured to find a buyer for the five-star hotel, said the people. Deliberations are ongoing and there’s no certainty they will result in a deal, according to the people. King Street declined to comment, as did a representative for Arnault.

Signa Prime Selection AG, the unit that owned the site, had agreed in April to sell three Italian properties, including Hotel Bauer, to the Schoeller Group, run by a German industrialist family of the same name. But a fund run by King Street has exercised rights to take control of the asset after the deal was announced.

Investment needed to reopen the 110-room hotel adds another complication for potential buyers. The site has been closed for a major renovation since 2022, and construction work stopped last year after Signa’s cash ran low.

It’s unclear what role the Schoeller Group is playing in the ongoing bidding. Administrators of Signa Prime have been in negotiations with Schoeller for months over claims related to a €200 million loan they provided to unit in the months before it filed for insolvency. Signa Prime said it had reached a debt standstill with the group this month.

A representative for Schoeller declined to immediately respond to Bloomberg questions.

LMVH owns a string of high-end hotels and properties in the luxury hospitality sector, including the Hotel Cipriani in Venice. It’s not clear whether the bidding would be done via LVMH or Agache — one of Arnault’s holding companies — one of the people said.","Billionaire Bernard Arnault has joined the chase to purchase a storied Venice hotel, one of the trophy assets put on the market in the messy fallout from the implosion of Rene Benko’s Signa Group.

Fortune,https://fortune.com/europe/2024/07/01/french-market-reaps-euro-stocks-boost-after-frances-far-right-wins-first-round-vote/,2024-07-01,09:07:19 UTC,French market rebounds and euro edges up after France's far-right wins first-round vote,"French markets rebounded after Marine Le Pen’s National Rally party finished with a smaller margin of victory than indicated by polls, spurring a relief rally across the nation’s assets.

The CAC 40 stock index surged almost 3% as Le Pen’s opponents started strategizing on how to keep the far right out of power. Ten-year government bonds opened higher, narrowing the spread over 10-year German securities by as much as seven basis points — trimming a more than 30 basis point surge over the past two weeks.

The euro edged up, climbing as much as 0.6% to $1.0776, though still remained 0.5% weaker than where it was before President Emmanuel Macron called the snap vote in early June. Credit risk in the region plunged.

Le Pen’s party dominated the first round of voting Sunday. But Macron’s centrist alliance and the left-wing New Popular Front are now weighing whether to pull candidates from the second round to keep the far-right National Rally from securing an absolute majority on July 7.

“The Leftist parties have indicated that they will withdraw candidates who came third in the 1st round to avoid splitting the vote next weekend,” said Jane Foley, head of FX strategy at Rabobank.

“This should limit the ability of the far-right to win an outright majority in parliament. This is providing some relief this morning, though with uncertainty high, markets are likely to remain wary,” she said.

Investors are concerned that Le Pen’s party will pursue expansive fiscal policy. At a projected 5.3% of output this year, France’s budget deficit already far exceeds the 3% of economic output allowed under European Union rules and its debt is expected to rise to 112% of economic output in 2024, according to the International Monetary Fund.

“While we expect some relief-tightening in OAT-Bund spreads, there is still uncertainty ahead,” said Evelyne Gomez-Liechti, a strategist at Mizuho. “Our analysis suggests that any significant tightening will be unstable given worrying debt sustainability dynamics.”

Le Pen’s National Rally locked up 33.2% of the vote, according to interior ministry figures. The New Popular Front got 28% and Macron’s coalition got 20.8%.

If alliances forming to block Le Pen from absolute power start to look credible, French markets would likely recover, according to Kathleen Brooks, research director at XTB.

“A hung parliament could make it hard to get anything done in France in the current parliament, which is exactly what the markets would like,” she said.

Shares of French banks Societe Generale, BNP Paribas and Credit Agricole all jumped on Monday, while the riskiest type of bonds issued by French lenders rose the most in weeks in early trading. Banks have been under pressure since Macron called the election due to rising political risk and the drop in French sovereign bonds.

What Bloomberg strategists say…

If the leftist alliance “is aimed at blocking Le Pen’s grouping from getting a majority in the crucial second round, it has wide-ranging implications for the France-German spread and indeed the euro. If the upshot is that we will get a more centrist government, it would be positive for the currency and herald a narrower spread.”

— Ven Ram, cross-asset strategist for MLIV

Still, strategists warn there is likely volatility ahead, as the electoral calculus gets complicated in the runoff when parties can strategically withhold candidates in certain constituencies to give a boost to a centrist hopeful.

Macron’s decision to call a snap vote in early June had sent markets into a tailspin.

His party — which supports large spending cuts to get France’s budget deficit under control — suffered a crushing defeat in European parliamentary elections. National Rally, meanwhile, has touted some costly budget measures including lowering the sales tax on energy and fuel.

Over the past three weeks, the extra yield investors demand to hold 10-year French bonds over safer German debt rocketed to more than 80 basis points, levels last seen during the euro area’s sovereign debt crisis. The euro fell to its lowest since early May.

It’s hard to see a “material and sustainable snapback,” in French yields, said Peter Goves, head of developed market debt sovereign research at MFS Investment Management.

“Uncertainties are high, French fundamentals haven’t changed and the final outcome is still unknown and unknowable with the large number of three-way contests complicating matters,” he said.","French markets rebounded after Marine Le Pen’s National Rally party finished with a smaller margin of victory than indicated by polls, spurring a relief rally across the nation’s assets.

Business Daily,https://www.businessdailyafrica.com/bd/economy/dar-port-starts-facelift-in-hub-status-fight-against-mombasa--4674792,2024-07-01,03:00:00 UTC,Dar Port starts facelift in hub status fight against Mombasa,"Tanzania’s seaport operations are set for a major overhaul after private investors took over the running of the maritime assets with plans to shore up the efficiency and competitiveness of the Dar es Salaam port in the fight for regional businesses with the port of Mombasa.

The refurbishment of Dar port has seen the number of containers entering the inland container depot (ICD) increase by more than 16 fold to 100 containers in 12 hours from six within the same amount of time, while the number of containers ferried by a single truck in 24 hours to 36 hours has increased from one to six.

“It is beneficial to the port because I can see a lot of competition by the private sector. It is a sign of improvement for the port,” says Emmanuel Mallya, an expert in port issues in Tanzania.

“We are seeing positive prospects for the growth of the port. We used to bring to our ICD six containers for 12 hours. Now for 12 hours we are bringing more than 100.”

Dar Port and Mombasa Port play pivotal roles in the East African maritime trade, serving as primary gateways for international trade, facilitating the smooth flow of goods and functioning as transhipment hubs within the region.

The two ports' efficiency affects regional integration, economic growth and trade.

Port users are already seeing early dividends in the shift to allow private players to run the port at a time when Tanzania is working to attract more cargo to its shores.

According to Mr Mallya, a truck initially used to take between 24 hours to 36 hours to bring one container to the ICD but things are changing and currently one truck brings up to six containers.

“All our inland container yards are now full of containers. We don’t know where to send additional ones,” he says.

Dar port serves countries such as Malawi, Zambia, Eastern DRC, Burundi, Rwanda, Zimbabwe and Uganda while Mombasa caters to Uganda, South Sudan, Northeastern DRC, Burundi, and Rwanda.

Tanzania has handed over the operations and management of its maritime sea assets to Dubai’s DP World and India’s Adani International Ports Holdings (AIPH) for a period of 30 years.

The country hopes to overhaul the performance of its maritime assets and strategically position Dar port to compete effectively with the port of Mombasa.

Mombasa port bypassed its main regional competitors, Djibouti and Dar es Salaam in the latest World Bank global ports index over ship delays and non-tariff barriers.

The Container Port Performance Index (CPPI) 2023, shows that the port of Dar es Salaam dropped 55 places from 312 to 367, blamed on inefficiencies while increasing business bottlenecks in the Djibouti port, a facility touted as the region’s maritime hub, resulted in a drastic drop from position 26 in 2022 to 379 in 2023.

DP World and the Tanzanian government signed a deal in October 2023 for the Emirati logistics company to manage two-thirds of Dar es Salaam port for the next 30 years. Under the deal, DP World will operate and modernise the multi-purpose Dar Port.

DP World will initially invest more than $250 million to upgrade the port and the investment could increase to $1 billion during the concession period, alongside hinterland logistics projects.

The agreement aims to optimise the port’s operations to improve transport and logistics services throughout Tanzania and its hinterland.

Adani has also been granted a 30-year concession to manage Dar es Salaam port’s Container Terminal 2, which includes four berths and has an annual cargo handling capacity of 1 million Twenty-Foot Equivalent Units.

With this development, foreign investors now control eight out of 12 berths at the facility.

Kenya is also considering privatisation initiatives for multiple berths at the Mombasa and Lamu ports.

Last year, the Kenya Port Authority invited investors to express their interest in leasing port infrastructure through public-private partnerships.

Dar Port, handles 90 percent of Tanzania’s trade, clearing $15 billion of merchandise annually.

DP World has begun to enhance the port's efficiency with new equipment and systems, promising significant economic benefits for Tanzania and its neighbouring countries.

Recently, the port witnessed the operation of ship-to-shore cranes for the first time, powered by mega generators moved into the terminal by DP World.

This new infrastructure enabled the completion of the first sulfur vessel in a record four days, marking a historic milestone for the port.

Additionally, the modernisation efforts have allowed the longest vessel ever to dock at the port.","Dar port serves countries such as Malawi, Zambia, Eastern DRC, Burundi, Rwanda, Zimbabwe and Uganda while Mombasa caters to Uganda, South Sudan, Northeastern DRC, Burundi, and Rwanda.

Business Daily,https://www.businessdailyafrica.com/bd/economy/how-kenya-paid-sh197bn-interest-on-debut-eurobond--4675074,2024-07-01,03:00:00 UTC,How Kenya paid Sh197bn interest on debut Eurobond,"Kenyan taxpayers paid $1.53 billion (Sh197.4 billion) in interest on the 2014 Eurobond whose last instalment was repaid last Friday, underlining the heavy cost of reliance on commercial debt to fund the budget.

The interest paid is the equivalent of 55.6 percent of the $2.75 billion (Sh354 billion in Monday’s rate) that the Treasury borrowed in the debut sovereign bond in June 2014.

This bond was sold in two tranches of five and 10 years, split at $750 million (Sh96.5 billion) and $2 billion (Sh257.4 billion) and paying interest at rates of 5.875 percent and 6.875 percent respectively.

Eurobonds attract a fixed rate of interest during the life of the loan, and the principal is repaid in a bullet payment upon maturity, rather than on a reducing balance basis.

This is unlike the concessional loans whose principal amount is paid down progressively alongside interest, sparing the borrower having to pay high interest throughout the life of a loan.

Eurobond loans also pose a repayment problem upon maturity as the borrower is required to settle the principal in one go, causing foreign currency liquidity pressure on the exchequer.

For the five-year bond—which the government repaid in June 2019—the interest charge totalled $214.2 million (Sh27.6 billion). On the 10-year paper, the total interest amounted to $1.32 billion (Sh169.8 billion), owing to its higher quantum and longer tenor.

The 10-year bond was partially repaid ahead of time in February through a buyback that was financed by a new Eurobond sale. The buyback saw the State retire $1.44 billion worth of notes early, with the balance being repaid last Friday using the proceeds of a $1.2 billion loan contracted from the World Bank.

“Payment was settled on June 21. Bondholders have received their due (and) the matter is behind us,” Public Debt Management Office director-general Haron Sirima said.

At the time of issuance, the debut Eurobond was seen as a relatively cheap option for development financing owing to the prevailing low international interest rates, and therefore an alternative for domestic borrowing in order to reduce competition for credit with the private sector.

The government identified a number of infrastructure projects in agriculture, transport and energy for funding using the proceeds of the bond, although subsequent audits did not show direct allocation to the projects as had been planned.

In the energy sector, the Treasury indicated that the money would go to expanding transmission lines, and exploration and drilling of geothermal wells.

In the transport sector, the Treasury identified the dredging of the Lamu Port, which was in its initial stages of development at the time, and an urban commuter rail linking the Nairobi city centre the Jomo Kenyatta International Airport as priorities for fund allocation.

In agriculture, funding was earmarked for the Galana-Kulalu irrigation project. These projects were supposed to generate income to help service the loan, according to the initial plans by the government.

A special audit done in 2019 by the Office of the Auditor-General, however, found that the funds were likely put into general budgetary use by ministries after being transferred to the exchequer account.

This made it difficult to identify whether the proceeds of the bond were put into the specific projects that had been earmarked for funding.

Subsequent Eurobond sales have tended to go towards general funding of the budget, or repaying other maturing debt.

In February 2018, part of the proceeds of the second Eurobond sale, which raised Sh202 billion, was used to retire syndicated loans contracted in 2015 and 2017.","Kenyan taxpayers paid $1.53 billion (Sh197.4 billion) in interest on the 2014 Eurobond whose last instalment was repaid last Friday, underlining the heavy cost of reliance on commercial debt to fund the budget.

Official estimates showed that the items listed as non-essential for the President’s office total Sh667 million— putting the focus on the size of chops that would be effected to justify his austerity promise while avoiding inconvenience to his day-to-day activities.

Cuts to travel expenditure may see Dr Ruto reduce local and foreign trips, while the planned refurbishment of his office in Nairobi’s Central Business District and the modernisation of the government printing press could also be halted in the rationalisation plan.

The pronouncement by the President proposing cuts to his office budget was forced upon by days of deadly protests in which the public demanded an end to wasteful and frivolous spending by the State amidst lean times caused by high debt levels.

The proposed cuts to spending by the Executive Office of the President are expected to precede further reductions in spending plans with President Ruto directing the National Treasury to pursue additional austerity measures to cut non-essential spending by Parliament, the Judiciary, and county governments.

“I direct immediate further austerity measures extending to the entire Executive arm of government. I direct that operational expenditure in the Presidency be reduced to remove allocations for the confidential vote, reduce travel budget, hospitality and purchase of motor vehicles, renovations, and other expenditures,” President Ruto said.

The listed spending areas had an allocation of Sh667 million for the financial year starting today, according to data from the National Treasury budget books.

Spending on domestic and foreign travel had been estimated at Sh10.4 million and Sh7.5 million respectively, a higher allocation compared to the Sh5.2 million and Sh7.2 million programmed in the budget ended June 30. The hospitality supplies and services budget was however lower at Sh84.7 million in contrast to Sh144.1 million previously.

The purchase of vehicles and other transport equipment for the Executive Office of the President would have however gobbled up Sh50 million from Sh27.3 million previously.

Other recurrent spending areas for the office cover printing, advertising, and information supplies and services; training expenses, purchase of fuel and lubricants, purchase of office furniture and the routine maintenance of vehicles and other transport equipment.

Proposed cuts to development spending by the office cover the refurbishment of buildings at Harambee House which hosts the Executive Office of the President and the modernisation of the press and refurbishment of buildings at the government printer which sits on Haile Selassie Avenue in the capital city.

The budget to refurbish the President's office in Nairobi CBD was set at Sh14.3 million while the upgrade of the government printer would cost Sh500 million.

The total budget to the Executive Office of the President had been set at Sh5.3 billion for the year to June 2025.

President William Ruto can implement the desired changes to the Sh3.92 trillion budget through the 1st supplementary estimates for the 2024/25 financial year having signed the 2024 Appropriations Bill into law on Friday as passed by MPs.

The President indicated that the supplementary budget would achieve cuts of Sh346 billion covering the hole resulting from the withdrawal of the 2024 Finance Bill.

The initial Sh3.92 trillion budget included Sh2.78 trillion in recurrent spending, Sh687.9 billion in development spending, Sh446.1 billion in transfers to counties including equitable share, Sh43.6 billion to Parliament, and Sh23.6 billion to the Judiciary.

The National Treasury expected to fund the budget through Sh3.3 trillion in total revenue collections including Sh2.91 trillion in taxes, leaving behind a balance of Sh597 billion to be plugged by Sh33.8 billion in external financing and Sh263.2 billion in domestic borrowing.","President William Ruto faces public scrutiny and delicate juggling over his pledge to cut non-essential expenditures in his office, including travel, hospitality, and the purchase of motor vehicles to curb the wastage of funds.
The proposed cuts to spending by the Executive Office of the President are expected to precede further reductions in spending plans with President Ruto directing the National Treasury to pursue additional austerity measures to cut non-essential spending by Parliament, the Judiciary, and county governments.
I direct that operational expenditure in the Presidency be reduced to remove allocations for the confidential vote, reduce travel budget, hospitality and purchase of motor vehicles, renovations, and other expenditures,” President Ruto said.

Business Daily,https://www.businessdailyafrica.com/bd/opinion-analysis/columnists/leaders-gaslighting-us-to-submission--4674968,2024-07-01,02:00:00 UTC,Leaders gaslighting us to submission,"The Merriam-Webster Dictionary defines gaslighting as the psychological manipulation of a person usually over an extended period of time that causes the victim to question the validity of their own thoughts, perception of reality, or memories and typically leads to confusion, loss of confidence and self-esteem, uncertainty of one's emotional or mental stability and a dependency on the perpetrator.

The dictionary continues to explain that the term gaslighting originated from the title of a 1938 play and the movies based on that play, the plots of which involve a man attempting to make his wife believe that she is going insane. His mysterious activities in the attic cause the house’s gas lights to dim, but he insists to his wife that the lights are not dimming and that she can’t trust her own perceptions.

I ended my column last Monday by saying that following the Gen Z protests the previous week, corporate leaders need Gen Z mentors to help them get a real-time understanding of their current and future customers. Then things became hotter last Tuesday and Thursday.

Gas flame hot. Conversations on various social media platforms became emotive, passionate and even incendiary. Two debates on two different groups that I am a member of stood out for me. The first, a neighbourhood group, had two Members of Parliament (MPs) who voted yes and were specifically called out for this. One MP hugged a mute tree and remained as silent as a Manchester United fan at a Premier League Recent Winner’s Whatsapp group as the group chatter went on and on about how tone-deaf the political class were choosing to be against their constituents.

The second MP chose to leap off the self-incriminating cliff with defensive clapbacks on why they voted yes, once a video of them speaking in Parliament supporting the controversial Finance Bill was posted on the group. This MP thumped their chest and said they had nothing to apologise for. The abuses that followed sent the second MP to join the first one sitting under the Old Trafford mute tree.

The second debate was on a different group of professional colleagues. Amongst them is a senior public servant who chose to come in and throw a grenade. Rather than reading the room where there was also much discussion about the reason behind the tax protests, the individual chose to paint a picture of chaos, fear and despondency if the protests, which by this time had started having violent outcomes, didn’t end.

The individual did not for a single minute explain the rationale behind the Finance Bill. Not a single minute. Consequently, many of the other group members called the individual out, asking them to remove the rose-tinted glasses and red carpet-lined blinkers that were blocking them from seeing what the mood of the nation was. Following the withdrawal of the Finance Bill later that day, nothing has been heard from the individual who likely joined the other MPs sitting under the Old Trafford mute tree.

Legislators post dancing videos on Tiktok, swaying their hips with shiny faces lifted to the Range Rover heavens, thanking their Lexus gods for the far they have come.

When called out for the exuberance of their instant coffee wealth, they rubbish the naysayers and call them jealous. They gaslight the public and tell them how a stable country is critical for prosperity and that the new taxes will be good for the country. They look for an evil bogeyman who is pulling the strings of resistance, since Kenyans are unable, neither individually nor collectively, to see wanton wastage and blatant corruption.

We get it, dear public servants. We get it completely. You know better than us what is good for us. You know what good governance looks like from the third floor of your newly purchased Karen villas. You rush to give us good governance as your chase cars run us off the road, with the ubiquitous dour-faced bodyguard pointing an ashen walkie-talkie holding wrist at us for daring to share the same tarmac that you do.","The first, a neighbourhood group, had two Members of Parliament (MPs) who voted yes and were specifically called out for this.

The 2023/2024 medical cover by the National Hospital Insurance Fund (NHIF) expired on Sunday, June 30, paving the way for SHIF.

State Department for Public Service Principal Secretary (PS) Amos Gathecha said the new procurement was initiated following the lapse of the 2023/2024 contract under NHIF.

""The NHIF contract was executed for a period of one year from July 1, 2023 to June 30, 2024,"" he said.

The new development ends uncertainty and gives relief to patients who are currently admitted and undergoing treatment in various health facilities under the NHIF cover.

""The purpose of this circular is to inform you of the continued provision of comprehensive provision of medical insurance services for the next two months,"" said Mr Gathecha in a notice issued on Friday.

The scheme covers national government employees in ministries and State departments, officers seconded in the county governments and staff of the National Youth Service. It covers all services, including radiotherapy, chemotherapy and dialysis.

Health Cabinet Secretary (CS) Susan Nakhumicha last week announced that preparation for the rollout of SHIF will commence on July 1, with registration of persons.

The exercise, she said, will be conducted countrywide through self-registration by use of a USSD *147# or www.sha.go.ke.

The CS noted that Kenyans will be assisted by community health promoters, NHIF staff in their offices and any other registration point that the Social Health Authority (SHA) board will designate.

In response to the withdrawal of Finance Bill 2024 which aimed to fund the Primary Healthcare Fund, the Emergency, Chronic and Critical Illness Fund and allocate funds for indigents and vulnerable persons, she said the ministry is now adjusting its plans to reflect this development.

""I want to assure all Kenyans, in particular, those who have been enjoying healthcare services under NHIF that they will not be denied treatment during this rollout phase,” she said.","Civil servants will continue enjoying comprehensive medical insurance services for the next two months, despite the transition to the new Social Health Insurance Fund (SHIF) planned for Monday.

Business Daily,https://www.businessdailyafrica.com/bd/lifestyle/profiles/mary-wamae-iron-lady-that-has-shaped-equity-group-exits--4675094,2024-07-01,02:00:00 UTC,Mary Wamae: Iron lady that has shaped Equity Group’s recent success exits,"As she charts the next path after leaving the board of directors of Equity Group Holdings, Mary Wangari Wamae will be opening a fresh chapter in her rich personal story.

She was the group executive director for Equity Holdings, a role that saw her oversee all of the bank's subsidiaries. Besides the long-serving CEO James Mwangi and the founder and former chairman Peter Munga, Ms Wamae is perhaps the only other prominent personality who has shaped the history of Equity Bank.

As one promotion followed the other, rumours swirled that she was being groomed to replace Mwangi. Her exit puts to rest those rumours.

Ms Wamae is certainly one of the authors of Equity's recent success story, which started with a remarkable turnaround that saw Equity miraculously escape dissolution by the regulator after years of operating under insolvency. When Wamae joined Equity in 2004, after a 13-year legal practice, she played a key role in writing the next chapter of Equity, chief among which was converting the financial institution from a troubled building society into a formidable pan-African bank with a presence in seven countries.

Ms Wamae, a lawyer by training, was also part of the team that helped Equity Bank list on the Nairobi Securities Exchange (NSE), giving the lender the impetus to make the great leap into Pan-African banking.

A conglomerate with business interests spanning different sectors, Equity Group would become the first company in the region to cross the Sh1 trillion in assets in 2020.

There is just something about Wamae and Mwangi that makes them the perfect bearers of Equity Bank's DNA: They both had humble beginnings and were raised by single mothers in rural Central Kenya.

It is these modest beginnings which informed Equity's reincarnation as a bank for the common mwananchi, with the tier-one lender revolutionizing micro-lending in Kenya.

In the 1990s, banks were snobbish. They didn’t think the poor people like Mwangi's and Wamae's mothers were bankable.

The income for most of these poor rural folks was not only erratic, but it was also unreliably erratic. Banks slammed their doors on Wanjiku, and she clammed up with her money.

Thus, Wamae, who was also brought up in hardship in Kenya, was a perfect catch for Equity's spirit when she joined the company in 2004 as the secretary. Just like Mwangi, she embodied the fighting spirit of Equity Bank.

In a past interview, Wamae credited her mother for bequeathing her with the fighting spirit, and not to complain despite difficult circumstances one may find themselves in.

Raised in Nyeri County by a single mother in a family of six children, Ms Wangari did not have an easy childhood. Her mother did not have a fixed income but she made all efforts to educate her.

She powered through her education journey with finesse, picking a reading habit in the process. Later in life, she became an avid reader.

When she graduated with a law degree from the University of Nairobi (UoN) in 1990, Ms Wangari was beginning the journey towards breaking from the obscurity that her background risked driving her to.

Joining UoN offered her the chance to visit the capital for the first time in her life. She was in the famous UoN class that had the likes of Trade Cabinet Secretary Rebecca Miano, MPs Millie Odhiambo and Caroli Omondi, lawyers like Ahmednasir Abdullahi and Azimio leader Raila Odinga’s lawyer Paul Mwangi, Supreme Court judge Isaac Lenaola, among others.

The class has a grouping called MV90 and Ms Wangari once did a video explaining the unique aspects of the group.

A mother of three girls, Ms Wangari had a divorce in 2018. She told the Business Daily in a 2022 interview that the divorce affected her.

“I asked God questions,” she said. “I have done many successful projects, overseen successful investments in this bank that run in a trillion, but why couldn’t I make my marriage succeed? How come this project failed?”

In the interview, she also spoke of the need for women to be financially independent so that in case something goes wrong in their marriages, they have a way out.

Her Nairobi residence is proof that she has established herself financially, and in a recent interview in the palatial residence, where she spoke about her love for books, she was happy to show the Business Daily her home library, which has quite a collection of books.

Ms Wangari has lately been giving mentorship sessions about money and investments, and she said she is reading a lot on the topic.

“I’m doing quite a lot of mentorship on that,” she said. “[Books] help me to consolidate my thoughts around that topic…I wouldn’t want to mislead people when I mentor them, because sometimes they take what you say as the gospel truth.”

In 2023, Ms Wangari released her biography The Village Girl: My Dream, Life and Legacy where she set out her story in full, candidly capturing the moments in her life that needed her to be resilient and to show leadership. Her policy is that biographies should not always be about the good things that happen to people.

“There is a tendency to only tell the good things,” she said. “If a book is written in a way that it only depicts the good part of it, either the good part of an individual or the good things that happen to them, then of course we have question marks: Is it real? Is it authentic? That is why now people are looking for authentic stories because an authentic and balanced story will talk about the peaks, but it will also talk about the lows.”

She practised as a lawyer for 13 years before joining Equity Group, seeing it transform into the regional behemoth it is today.

Ms Wangari started a reading club for women at the bank, called the Equity Inspire Programme (Equip), as she sought to prepare female bankers for leadership roles.

“The aim of the programme is to encourage them and help them to equip themselves with the right skills, the right knowledge, the right confidence to lead in a bank and financial services group like Equity,” she told the Business Daily.","As she charts the next path after leaving the board of directors of Equity Group Holdings, Mary Wangari Wamae will be opening a fresh chapter in her rich personal story.

Business Daily,https://www.businessdailyafrica.com/bd/markets/commodities/why-nse-firms-want-unsold-ktda-tea-destroyed--4674766,2024-07-01,02:00:00 UTC,Why NSE firms want unsold KTDA tea destroyed,"Nairobi Securities Exchange-listed firms Williamson Tea and Kapchorua Tea have called for the destruction of huge stocks of unsold tea held by the giant Kenya Tea Development Agency (KTDA) to save the industry from being choked by excess supplies of the commodity which has hurt prices.

The two tea firms, which share majority owners, said in separate financial filings on Friday that tea prices have fallen to unsustainable levels as a result of market saturation, while also hitting out at the minimum pricing system that has hit producers who are unable to supply top grade tea.

In 2022, the State set a minimum price of $2.43(Sh 314.73) per kilogramme on KTDA to safeguard farmers’ earnings. Farmers affiliated with KTDA account for about 60 percent of Kenya’s tea production.

Improved production, coupled with a weaker shilling in 2023, helped Kapchorua and Williamson Tea book higher revenue in the year to March 2024, but they say that future profits are under threat due to the current situation at the auction.

Williamson Tea’s net profit for the period fell by 6.6 percent to Sh527 million, as higher costs ate into a 4.4 percent increase in revenue to Sh4.19 billion. Kapchorua’s net profit rose by 27 percent to Sh399.4 million, as its top-line revenue jumped 23.7 percent to Sh2.19 billion. Both are paying a final dividend of Sh15 per share, which when added to their interim dividends of Sh10 per share paid out earlier, brings their total dividend in the year to March to Sh25 per share.

“Despite the positive results of the period, the prospects for the company and Kenyan tea industry are dire. Tea prices have declined to unsustainable levels in the face of market saturation and the consequences of an estimated 200 million kilogrammes of unsold KTDA teas,” said Williamson Tea in its financial report for the year ended March 2024.

“Dramatic action is required to enable the market to return to a normal dynamic and for prospects to improve. The destruction of all unsold KTDA teas and the removal of the auction minimum pricing system is needed with immediate effect.”

The Mombasa auction runs on a two-day format where secondary-grade quality tea is sold on Mondays and premium-grade ones on Tuesdays.

Any tea that is not sold on a scheduled auction day is reprinted on a fresh auction catalogue and returned to the auction two weeks later. A seller is only allowed to bring back unsold crops to the auction twice.

Any crop unsold after two auction trials is relegated to a sale window referred to as a “passive window” where produce fetches low pricing on perceived low quality.

With the minimum price in place, buyers shun lower quality tea—which they are unwilling to buy at the higher minimum price— leading to a rise in unsold stock at a time when production has gone up due to favourable weather.","Nairobi Securities Exchange-listed firms Williamson Tea and Kapchorua Tea have called for the destruction of huge stocks of unsold tea held by the giant Kenya Tea Development Agency (KTDA) to save the industry from being choked by excess supplies of the commodity which has hurt prices.

Business Daily,https://www.businessdailyafrica.com/bd/economy/uganda-s-exports-to-kenya-fall-amid-trade-tiffs--4674860,2024-07-01,02:00:00 UTC,Uganda’s exports to Kenya decline on trade disputes,"Expenditure on imports from Uganda declined 9.09 per cent in the first quarter of the year, pointing to the impact of an on-and-off tiff between Nairobi and Kampala over the entry of key farm goods such as eggs and milk powder.

The value of goods trucked into Kenya from Uganda through formal routes dropped to Sh7.48 billion in the three months through March 2024 compared with Sh8.23 billion the year before, according to provisional official trade statistics.

Reduced imports from Uganda at the time exports grew 7.17 per cent to Sh33.02 billion, helped widen Kenya’s goods trade surplus with its largest business partner to Sh25.54 billion from Sh22.58 billion the year before.

Uganda has over the years complained of a blockade of goods such as eggs, sugar, milk powder, and grains in protectionist policies aimed at shielding Kenyan farmers.

The rising trade barrier between the two nations was part of the agenda during Uganda’s President Yoweri Museveni’s two-day State visit to Nairobi in early May.

“We have agreed that trade between the two countries is unimpeded either by tariff or non-tariff barriers or arbitrary levies,” Kenya’s President William Ruto said on May 16 following Mr Museveni’s visit.

“We have agreed that the common principle will be the full implementation of the EAC customs and other infrastructure that support trade between East African countries. Therefore, all the issues around rice, juice, furniture, eggs, chicken, and sugar are now resolved.”

Brookside Limited, owned by parent company Brookside Dairy of Kenya, however, said it is among the most affected businesses, with up to 114 export permits denied by the Kenya Dairy Board since March last year.

“We were delighted to read the communique signed by the two countries when the two heads of State met in Nairobi, as we believe it was key to unlocking trade barriers that have existed since March last year. However, a month later, we are yet to receive export permits for our long-life milk, which includes powder and ultra-high temperature (UHT) processed milk,” Benson Mwangi, Brookside Limited’s general manager, told a media briefing in Kampala last week.

Although Kenya has been Uganda’s main market for dairy products, emerging trade restrictions have seen Kampala search for new markets, mainly in North and West Africa.

Mr Mwangi said Brookside Limited had written several reminders to the Kenya Dairy Board (KDB) on the pending permit applications.

Still, unfortunately, no response has been received so far from the regulator. “We are optimistic that KDB could soon implement the tenets of the communique by the two heads of state, which would unlock the impasse and allow us to resume export of our products,” Mr Mwangi said.

East African Community (EAC) Customs Union Protocol, the bloc’s first integration breakthrough which came into force in 2005, allows the free movement of goods, services, capital, and labour within the bloc.

The seven-member trading has, however, continued to experience unending trade tiffs, slowing growth in intra-regional trade despite the bloc being the most integrated in Africa.

Imports from Tanzania, for instance, fell by a third (32.69 percent) in the first quarter of 2023 to Sh7.99 billion when Dar es Salaam restricted sale of grains to neighbouring countries.

The measures were part of food export restrictions which Dar es Salaam started enforcing in 2022 to ensure food security in a trading bloc that perennially experiences deficit in maize, a staple.","Reduced imports from Uganda at the time exports grew 7.17 per cent to Sh33.02 billion, helped widen Kenya’s goods trade surplus with its largest business partner to Sh25.54 billion from Sh22.58 billion the year before.

Last week’s T-bill auction, which aimed to raise Sh24 billion, only realised Sh7.6 billion in investor bids against Sh14.4 billion in the previous week.

Bids on the short-tenor papers narrowed throughout June, falling from Sh36.2 billion in the first week, and Sh22.7 billion in the second.

Interest rates on the bills have nevertheless continued to soar week on week with the return on the 91-day T-bill edging higher to hit 15.9771 percent.

Rates on the 182-day and 364-day bills have meanwhile hit 16.7636 and 16.7911 percent, respectively.

The market-weighted average interest rate for the 91-day paper pushed above 16 percent in the auction signaling underlying pressures on interest rates despite CBK expectations on the easing of interest rates on government securities.

CBK has continued to reject expensive bids from investors having accepted Sh6 billion from the recent auction despite its underperformance.

Investor apathy on Treasury Bills is expected to put the apex bank under pressure as it seeks to raise at least Sh15.6 billion from this week’s T-bill auction to cover the redemption of previously issued short-term papers.

The balance of Sh8.3 billion is expected to cover new borrowing from T-bills.

High interest rates on T-bills continue to linger in a high for longer interest rate environment which is underpinned by a tight monetary policy with the Central Bank Rate at 13 percent compared to 10.5 percent at the same time last year.","The demand for Treasury bills (T-bills) by investors has dried up even as interest rates on the short-dated securities continue to rise, upsetting the Central Bank of Kenya’s (CBK) plan of lowering interest rates on government paper.

The State reinsurer raised the dividend by 50 percent from Sh0.2 per share paid for the financial year ended 2022 on the back of the increased profits. Shareholders also approved a bonus share issue that will see them bag one share for each held, translating to an overall Sh6.69 billion.

Kenya Re posted a 44.6 percent growth in profit after tax of Sh4.9 billion in the year ended December 2023 from Sh3.5 billion in the year before.

In the review period, investment income grew from Sh4.6 billion to Sh6.5 billion attributed to a rise in interest revenue calculated using the effective interest method which rose from Sh2.9 billion to Sh3.6 billion.

The net investment and insurance result saw a growth of 42 percent from Sh5.78 billion in 2022 to Sh8.19 billion posted last year.

Profit before tax for the year 2023 stood at Sh7.03 billion, an increase of 53 percent from profit before tax of Sh4.59 billion in 2022.

Kenya Re said the decline in insurance revenue was because it had been closing its Indian agricultural business because of flood losses.

""The corporation's deliberate move to scale down on loss-making classes of business eg agriculture business from India and medical classes of business,” said Kenya Re.

Last year Kenya Re told the Business Daily, that it was planning to vacate the Indian market over rising losses stemming from the agriculture underwriting business.

“We are doing a strategic withdrawal from the Indian market where we suffered heavy losses in the agriculture business and if you look at our half-year performance, you will notice we have taken a cut in premiums because we have forgone Sh2 billion premiums from the Indian market,” said Hillary Maina Wachinga, Kenya Re’s Group managing director.

Business Daily,https://www.businessdailyafrica.com/bd/corporate/technology/how-firms-can-ride-on-x-spaces-to-net-masses--4675042,2024-07-01,01:00:00 UTC,How firms can ride on X Spaces to net masses,"For the longest time, whenever Kenyan marketers wanted to engage masses on social media platforms, they have relied on uploading posts.

In recent weeks, however, X has emerged as a powerhouse in assembling mass audiences through its ‘Spaces’. The feature allows conveners to connect to audiences, share ideas as well as gather feedback.

It allows for a maximum of up to 13 speakers including the host and two co-hosts at any given time, while the number of listeners who can join is unlimited.

At the height of the anti-Finance Bill protests, organisers shattered records by setting up interactions that saw listeners hit highs of over 130,000, demonstrating the efficiency of the platform to gather mass audiences of diverse walks of life using minimal resources.

Unveiled in December 2020 to encourage individuals and businesses to build more personal connections with their audiences, the feature which acts like a virtual room allows users to have live audio conversations.

Other rival offerings, which have not gained as much traction, include Meta’s beta app for Oculus Rift which allows Facebook friends to hang out in virtual reality as well as WhatsApp channels and WhatsApp communities which are close-knit group tools used to organise and manage conversations.

According to digital marketing strategist Egline Samoei, X emerged as an effective tool for mobilisation during the protests because of its open structure that allows prioritisation of topics in feeds as opposed to individual relationships between interacting accounts.

“It’s an open and public platform in that you don’t have to be friends with someone to view their postings hence the content reaches as many people as possible,” she opines.

“X Spaces has proven to be a powerful feature on X. Businesses can leverage this feature for brand awareness, driving engagements and community-building conversations around products to provide a deeper level understanding which will in turn foster brand loyalty,” she adds noting that the engagements are also fertile ground from which businesses would pick valuable customer insights.

Her sentiments are echoed by Dennis Maina, managing partner at digital marketing agency Suss Digital Africa, who calls on marketers to stay adaptive and forward-thinking.

“The digital marketing landscape is in a constant state of flux, and success lies in the ability to not just ride the waves but to anticipate and leverage the currents that propel the industry forward,” he states. “Marketers need to ensure each interaction contributes to a unified brand image and a consistent narrative.”

Other gains derived from hosting the conversations include increased visibility on the general platform, helping businesses network with relevant influencers, offering an opening to demonstrate expertise as a specialised authority as well as strengthening relationships with customers.

But how do you amass the numbers?

The pundits explain that the first step is always building a strong community that discusses topics of collective interest, while also taking care to occasionally throw in themes around general trends to sustain interest.

According to Ms Samoei, one of the key primary challenges that businesses seeking to pursue the route will grapple with is maintaining a consistency of high-quality topics that keep audiences engaged throughout.

“Also, since the x Spaces is public, one may face brand hijacking or brand safety issues. It’s worth mentioning that sometimes the X Space may experience glitches making the Spaces inaccessible for some users,” she states.","In recent weeks, however, X has emerged as a powerhouse in assembling mass audiences through its ‘Spaces’.

Their partner in the project was a large multinational organisation that had deployed similar solutions for a handful of other peers in different markets.

By all measures, ambition, and logic, this should have been a walk in the park, with world-class infrastructure, fantastic pedigree in talent, and subscribed standards. What remained unaccounted for was the deep fragmentation in devices on the network at the time, meaning that suddenly the standard would not deliver. Enter naivety.

When we think about the concept of disruption, we are inclined to imagine that it requires one to be well-versed in an industry, sector, product, service, or process. Shouldn't the best solutions come from those who understand the intricacies of the problem they are solving?

Absolutely! But sometimes, the biggest roadblock to innovation is not a lack of knowledge, but an acceptance of the status quo, better articulated as standards.

In this story, I tasked my team to think through possible solutions to the problem, with a deliberate decision made not to mention the ""problematic” standard. To be clear, the issue was not in the standard itself, as it addressed the section of the market, but that its presence and prior deployment success blinded those on the project to any other options, including going back to the drawing board.

In a few weeks, across multiple sprints, the team delivered a solution that passed the test for problem fit, deployed, and scaled to great success.

As counterintuitive as it may sound, the ability to look at a problem or opportunity through virgin eyes can many times be the differentiator in creating and unlocking value.

Look at the innovations celebrated now. They may seem obvious after the fact but were most likely viewed as ludicrous at the beginning. You must question and interrogate how things have always been done, to either take a tangent and chart a new path or improve on the current one.

However, there is a caveat. Unchecked, naivety can be a recipe for disaster. While a clear-eyed view of the problem cum opportunity is essential, so is a healthy respect for the realities of the industry. Naivety can easily become a liability, potentially leading to wasted time, capital, and ultimately a failed venture.

The sweet spot lies in striking a balance. The ideal team might have a visionary outsider at the top tempered by seasoned industry veterans who can help navigate sector complexities, sidestepping critical mistakes and errors.

Ultimately, the key to unlocking the true power of disruption lies in recognising that the most transformative ideas often come from those who see the world a little differently. Naivety, combined with experience and respect for the playing field, can become the secret sauce that moves a startup from an audacious idea to an industry-changing force.","Enter naivety.

Business Daily,https://www.businessdailyafrica.com/bd/lifestyle/health-fitness/why-tall-people-get-backaches--4675050,2024-07-01,01:00:00 UTC,Why tall people get backaches,"One of the most often reported forms of irritation is back pain. If you deal with back discomfort regularly, you undoubtedly already know a few standard preventative measures. You can take steps to improve your posture, stand up straight while moving, and make sure you're sitting comfortably in your chair while working.

There are the same number of vertebrates in each person's spine, regardless of height. And that's where the issue is. Taller people seem to have larger vertebrates, yet we may all have the same amount. However, the increase in size may not always correspond with an increase in width, which makes it more difficult for the core muscles to withstand the impacts of those longer levers and limbs.

Why tall people get back pain

• Bad posture: tall people tend to slouch or adopt poor posture habits to accommodate their height, which can strain the back muscles and lead to discomfort or pain.

• Injuries- tall people are prone to injuries, especially in sports where longer limbs mean a long distance to the ground.

• Increased spinal stress- tall individuals often have longer spines, which can result in increased stress on spinal discs and vertebrae. This extra stress can contribute to conditions like herniated discs, spinal stenosis and other back issues.

• Muscle imbalances- the musculature of tall individuals may be imbalanced due to their height, leading to certain muscles becoming overworked while others are underutilised.

• Joint strain- Tall people may experience increased strain on their joints due to the longer lever arms in their limbs. This strain can affect the ligament of the spine and contribute to back problems.

• Genetics- while height itself is not a direct cause of back problems, certain genetic factors that contribute to a person's height may also play a role in their susceptibility to back issues.

Preventive measures to avoid back pain

• Core and back-strengthening exercises.

• Maintaining a good posture, sit and stand erect without slouching. Avoid looking down at your phone or other devices for extended periods. Keep your face forward as much as possible.

• Also you can use a lumbar support cushion in your seat to prevent low back pain and find ways to keep the spine aligned while you sleep. That means getting a comfortable pillow, updating your mattress and sleeping on your sides rather than your stomach.

• Drinking water also helps to hydrate your joints and keep them flexible.

• Routine physiotherapy care can also prevent back problems from progressing.

Physiotherapy management of back pain

•Early activity, encouraging early movement in back pain is one of the significant aspects of treatment in back pain.

• Specific stabilisation exercises, helps in improving strength and stability of the muscles which have been weakened due to back pain.

• Postural guidelines, guiding the patient about correct postural habits and ways to maintain accurate posture and avoid back pain

• Mobilisation or manipulative physiotherapy concentrates on promoting mobilisation of the specific affected area and is used to target the specific point of pain.

• General exercises and stretches, structured exercises and stretches are usually carried out in the context of patients' individual condition and cause of back pain.

• Ergonomic advice- since work-related hazards account for more than 65 percent of back problems, physiotherapists also concentrate on providing accurate ergonomic devices, guiding the patient using the appropriate infrastructure at work to avoid and cure back pain.","Why tall people get back pain• Bad posture: tall people tend to slouch or adopt poor posture habits to accommodate their height, which can strain the back muscles and lead to discomfort or pain.

Business Daily,https://www.businessdailyafrica.com/bd/lifestyle/health-fitness/down-syndrome-how-can-i-tell-if-my-child-will-have-it--4675058,2024-07-01,01:00:00 UTC,Down Syndrome: How can I tell if my child will have it?,"Down Syndrome is a genetic disorder where a person has three copies of chromosome 21 instead of two. Chromosomes are small “packages"" of genes in the body. They determine how a baby's body forms and functions as it grows in the womb and after birth.

Here is more to this condition that you need to know about.

How it occurs

A normal baby is born with 46 chromosomes (each cell contains 23 pairs), but babies with Down Syndrome have 47. This extra chromosome changes how the baby's body and brain develop, which can cause both mental and physical challenges for the baby. It is the most frequently occurring chromosomal disorder.

A person with Down Syndrome can be identified by their unique physical features, which include a flattened face, slanted eyes, a short neck, small ears, a tongue that tends to stick out of the mouth, small hands and feet and tiny spots on the iris of the eye. They also tend to be shorter in height than children and adults with poor muscle tone.

Classical Down Syndrome is not an inherited condition. It usually occurs because of a chance happening at the time of conception. However, in rare cases, (less than 5 percent), some recombinant genetic errors can be transmitted from parents to their offspring. Increasing maternal age after 35 years is one of the known risk factors.

Diagnosis during pregnancy

There are two tests available to detect Down Syndrome during pregnancy: screening tests and diagnostic tests. A screening test can tell a woman and her healthcare provider whether her pregnancy has a lower, or higher chance of having the condition, but it does not provide an absolute diagnosis. They are safer than diagnostic tests for the mother and the developing baby.

Screening tests often include a combination of a blood test, which measures the amount of various substances in the mother's blood, and an ultrasound, which creates a picture of the baby. During an ultrasound, one of the things the technician looks at is the fluid behind the baby's neck. Extra fluid in this region could indicate a genetic problem.

Diagnostic tests, on the other hand, can typically detect whether, or not a baby will have Down Syndrome, but they can be riskier for the mother and the developing baby.

These tests are usually performed after a positive screening test to confirm a Down Syndrome diagnosis by looking for changes in the chromosomes that would indicate the condition. This involves examining material from the placenta, the amniotic fluid and blood from the umbilical cord. Some of these tests may carry some risks depending on gestation and need to be discussed with the doctor.

Other complications

Apart from its effects on appearance, Down Syndrome can cause a number of medical complications. Some of these are more serious than others, but most of them can be treated. The most serious complications include heart defects, blood disorders like Leukemia and immune system problems.

Approximately half of all babies with Down Syndrome are born with heart defects. Usually, these defects affect the walls separating the four chambers of the heart. The condition can also cause blood cell abnormalities such as leukaemia.

The immune system of people with Down Syndrome is compromised and they are more vulnerable to infections, certain kinds of cancer and autoimmune conditions.

They also suffer from stomach and digestive problems including abnormally formed digestive organs that may require surgery and celiac disease, a condition that impairs their ability to absorb nutrients, especially gluten.

Down Syndrome can affect the way the body produces or responds to hormones causing hormonal disorders that contribute to obesity problems and Type 1 diabetes. People with Down Syndrome also suffer from skeletal problems caused by too much flexibility between the bones at the top of the spine that support the head.

Other less serious complications include intellectual disability, vision problems, hearing impairment, skin disorders, behavioural and psychological problems, height and weight, sleep apnea and fertility problems, especially in men.

Is Down Syndrome curable?

Though there is no cure for Down Syndrome, there are services available to help babies and children improve their physical and intellectual abilities. The management requires a multidisciplinary medical team approach.","Down Syndrome is a genetic disorder where a person has three copies of chromosome 21 instead of two.

A money order is a secure alternative to cash or a personal cheque, which you can use to send money or pay bills. It works much like a cheque and is usually issued by a banking institution. You can cash or deposit a money order into a bank account.

Money orders are readily accepted and converted to cash and are often used by people without access to a standard checking account. They are an acceptable form of payment for debts, both personal and business. You can buy a money order for a small service fee from most banking institutions.

Data from the Kenya National Bureau of Statistics (KNBS) shows the number of money orders issued last year fell by a third (33.3 percent) from 2022 pointing to a higher uptake of electronic funds transfers, mobile payment applications, and use of credit and debit cards.

Some 4.6 million money order papers were issued last year from 6.9 million in 2022.

Although the issued money orders declined, the number remains high and has been climbing from 1.19 million in 2019 to 3.15 million in 2020 and a high of 9.4 million in 2021.

""The number of money orders issued declined by 33.3 percent from 6,999 thousand in 2022 to 4,668 thousand in 2023,"" said the statistics bureau.

Despite the decline in their usage, money orders are preferred for their security compared to checks because they don't include personal banking information, such as the bank's account information.

Money orders are purchased upfront with cash, hence a minimal risk of having it bounce after depositing.

In jurisdictions where electronic payment methods are less prevalent, money orders can be a convenient and reliable way to send money and are widely acceptable.

Money orders are issued by the post office or banks. Some international payment service providers charge from as low as 1 percent of the sum value of a money order while others charge up to 8 percent of the principal amount.","A money order is a secure alternative to cash or a personal cheque, which you can use to send money or pay bills.

The age group, popularly known as Generation-Z (Gen-Zs) held a paltry 1,730 positions out of the 74,877 civil service jobs across the MDAs, while 41,689 jobs are held by Kenyans aged over 41.

Kenya has for years been struggling to create jobs for university and college graduates with the unemployment crisis fueling public outrage.

The disclosures, contained in a workforce review by the PSC highlight the lack of incentives such as career growth opportunities at the MDAs and remuneration as major causes of low retention of young talent.

“There is a moderate challenge in retention of employees under Generation-Z who usually join the service at the entry level,” PSC says. “This (low retention) could be attributed to the perception of low remuneration and unfavourable conditions of service, especially in view of global embracing of flexible-work arrangements and technology and lack of clarity in career advancement” it adds.

The age group between 20-24 years is the worst hit by Kenya’s ticking unemployment time bomb, with a growing number of them increasingly looking abroad, mainly in the Middle East, for employment.

Young Kenyans are keen to work for flexible hours with a majority finding it tough to work in the 8am to 5pm office environment.

Majority of the university and college graduates are opting for casual jobs and online tasks in the face of the thinning job opportunities at the government offices and private sector.

Treasury’s decision to freeze fresh recruitment at the government offices has further cut the chances of young Kenyans securing jobs in the MDAs and other public offices.

The private sector has also gone slow on hirings amid tough economic times marked by increased operational costs, stiff competition, and near-stagnant sales.

Frustration in securing jobs and a rising cost of living has fueled public anger with Gen-Zs currently at the forefront of anti-government protests that have rocked the country since this month, driven by the Finance Bill, 2024 which has since been withdrawn.

The PSC data shows that Kenyans aged between 36 to 40 years account for the highest chunk of the jobs at 16.21 percent or 12,136 slots followed by those in the bracket of 41 – 45 years at 15.49 (11,595).","The age group, popularly known as Generation-Z (Gen-Zs) held a paltry 1,730 positions out of the 74,877 civil service jobs across the MDAs, while 41,689 jobs are held by Kenyans aged over 41.

Business Daily,https://www.businessdailyafrica.com/bd/corporate/companies/nhc-stuck-with-sh1-3bn-unsold-houses--4674950,2024-07-01,01:00:00 UTC,NHC stuck with Sh1.3bn unsold houses,"The National Housing Corporation (NHC) is stuck with hundreds of houses valued close to Sh1.3 billion it has been unable to sell, even as the government pumps more through its affordable housing programme.

Latest details reveal that by June last year, the corporation had a stock of unsold houses across different parts of the country, some of which were completed years ago but have not attracted buyers.

“The statement of financial position reflects an inventories balance of Sh1,305,018,402 which includes an amount of Sh1,275,730,014 relating to stock of unsold houses held by the Corporation. As previously reported, despite some of the projects having been completed several years ago, the houses have remained unsold and hence they continue to be reported as inventories,” Auditor-General Nancy Gathungu notes in a report.

NHC housing units sell at between Sh1.58million and Sh8.75million, depending on the size and location. For instance, a studio apartment under the affordable housing scheme retails at Sh1.58 million while the most expensive three-bedroom master ensuite unit goes for Sh8.75 million. Although the auditor-general does not specify the number of unsold units, projections show that they are in their hundreds going by the Sh1.3 billion total value.

This raises questions on how the State will market the thousands of houses it has lined up with billions of shillings already being pumped into the programme.

President William Ruto continues to insist on the importance of the affordable housing project in the creation of jobs for youth but the government has been silent on how it will ensure the units are sold after completion, with the majority of targeted beneficiaries being low-income earners.

Formally employed Kenyans have since July last year been deducted 1.5 percent of their salaries towards the Housing Levy Tax, with the amounts being channelled to the Housing Fund.

But the auditor-general now reveals that with the “stock of unsold houses"" constructed over the years continuing to pile, NHC is now having to approach individuals and institutions to buy them, to no success.

“Management explained that it has scaled up engagement with County Governments, Saccos, Kenyans in the diaspora, and other relevant institutions to market the unsold houses,” Ms Gathungu says in her report on NHC.

Unable to offload the houses to the market, NHC has been forced to rent out houses worth Sh843 million, but Sh433 million houses remain idle.

On its website, the NHC lists at least 10 projects where it has residential houses it is selling. They include Kisumu Kanyakwar, Phase Three where it has 100 houses, and Stoni in Athi River where it has 160 unsold affordable houses and 110 unsold affordable houses in Homa Bay.

“In the circumstances, the Corporation may not have obtained value for money for the schemes implemented at Sh1,275,730,014 included under inventories,” the audit notes.

In its expression of commitment to Housing, the government budgeted Sh92.1 billion to the sector for the fiscal year starting July, including Sh67.4 billion that will go to affordable and social housing.

This is more than thrice the Sh28 billion budget the government allocated to Housing in the 2023/24 fiscal year, though only Sh5.45 billion had been spent by the end of May.

“The Government’s commitment is to turn the housing challenge into an economic opportunity to create quality jobs for the youth directly in the construction sector and indirectly through the production of building products,” Treasury Cabinet Secretary Njuguna Ndung’u said while delivering the 2024/25 budget.

The government’s plan- which has not been achieved so far- is to construct 200,000 houses every year.

MPs recently blocked a plan by the Treasury to open up affordable houses for open sale in the market, amid objection by Kenyans who sensed a plot to let non-deserving rich people end up being beneficiaries of the houses meant for low-earners.

Treasury had in the Finance Bill, 2024, proposed to amend the Affordable Housing Act to remove a requirement that owners of affordable houses seek approval from the affordable housing board prior to sale of their houses.

This risked leaving the houses free-for-all and selling at market prices, despite having been built on the back of taxpayers’ money so that they can specifically benefit low-earners.

“The Committee noted that the current provision in the Affordable Housing Act limits the right to property as enshrined in the Constitution and would be subject to abuse and therefore recommended deletion of the clause,” the National Assembly’s Finance and Planning Committee stated.

Section 54 of the Affordable Housing Act, 2024- which Treasury wanted to delete- states “Except with the prior written consent of the Board, a purchaser of an affordable housing unit under this Act shall not by contract, agreement or otherwise, sell or agree to sell his or her unit or any interest therein to any other person.”

Following the proposal by the Treasury, Kenyans petitioned parliament objecting to the move, arguing that it risked creating a loophole that would be exploited by rich, non-deserving persons to own the houses.

“Repealing the section that prohibits buyers from selling affordable houses will lead to speculative purchases by the wealthy and well-connected, thereby excluding the citizens who are intended to be the primary and sole beneficiaries of the programme,” a petitioner Kevin Wanambisi said.","“The statement of financial position reflects an inventories balance of Sh1,305,018,402 which includes an amount of Sh1,275,730,014 relating to stock of unsold houses held by the Corporation.

The sale of the unit, which was rubber-stamped at the company’s annual general meeting on Thursday, was occasioned by various challenges including failure to meet the expected return on capital.

UAP Insurance Tanzania was a short-term insurance business acquired in 2015 as part of the group’s East African growth strategy.

Based on the weak operating metrics, Old Mutual offered a discount to the buyer, Strategic Ventures Company Limited based on the unit’s net assets for the period ended December 31, 2023. “The value of UAP Insurance Tanzania has been determined as 50 percent of its net assets as of 31 December 2023 in line with the agreed upon transaction price and the recoverable amount is therefore 60 percent of that amount,” Old Mutual notes in its annual report.

UAP Insurance Tanzania had net assets of Sh245 million at the end of December 2023.

The unit posted a narrower loss of Sh191.8 million from a loss of Sh265.4 million in December 2022.

UAP Insurance Tanzania closed the same period with negative net revenues from insurance at Sh216.9 million after being bogged down by high insurance services expenses.

Old Mutual East Holdings Plc which is a subsidiary of Old Mutual East Africa Holdings Group owned 60 percent of UAP Insurance Tanzania Limited via its 100 percent stake in UAP Africa Limited.

Its shareholding in the Tanzania unit was made up of 137,400 ordinary shares and 100 percent of the unit’s preference shares.

Old Mutual says it is still keen on expanding into the region despite its exit from the short-term insurance business in Tanzania.

“Whilst divesting from the short-term insurance business in Tanzania, we plan to collaborate with local entities to extend our product and service offerings in the region,” Old Mutual added.

“East Africa remains a key growth node for the Old Mutual Group and therefore we remain committed to the future of East Africa markets, in 2018, we returned our primary operations to the African continent because we saw opportunities for growth.”

Old Mutual has other subsidiaries in Uganda and South Sudan including UAP Old Mutual Insurance Uganda Limited and UAP Properties Limited (South Sudan).

The company posted a narrow loss of Sh113.8 million in the year ended December 31, 2023, compared to a loss of Sh2.2 billion in 2022.

The improved performance for the Group was anchored on a rebound in its insurance service result as insurance revenues hit Sh32.6 billion from Sh28.4 billion.

Total investment income for the Group was also higher at Sh5.3 billion from Sh4.7 billion previously.","Regional insurer Old Mutual Holdings Plc has sold its Tanzanian subsidiary, Insurance Tanzania, for Sh73.5 million, a discount to the unit’s valuation by net assets.

Fresh data from the East African Communications Organisation (EACO) indicates that the regional penetration growth for the year ended last December outpaced both the average of the International Telecommunication Union (ITU) Africa region as well as the global average which moved 10 and four percentage points respectively.

In its regional sector report for 2023 published last week, EACO further indicated that the region’s mobile internet subscriptions stood at 61 percent penetration with the annual internet traffic hitting 2.9 billion gigabytes.

The regional average for third-generation (3G) coverage rose from 71 percent to 78 percent with Kenya and Rwanda leading with almost universal coverage at 97 percent and 99 percent respectively. Fourth generation (4G) on the other hand, expanded its regional coverage from 52 percent to 62 percent where Kenya and Rwanda again led the way with close to or exceeding 97 percent.

At the same time, mobile data prices in the region were found to have fallen significantly over the three years to last year, further accelerating the adoption of mobile services.

“The influx of low-cost smartphones from Chinese manufacturers has made mobile phones more accessible to a wider population. Increased competition among mobile network operators and government interventions have also driven down data costs, making internet access more affordable.”

According to EACO, innovations such as Kenya’s M-Pesa have partly contributed to the penetration growth due to their heavy reliance on mobile telephony services.

The report indicates that mobile money subscribers in the region stood at 128.7 million, reflecting a 64 percent penetration rate.

In Kenya, the latest Communications Authority of Kenya (CA) data shows that the total number of mobile phone devices connected to mobile networks stood at 65.7 million as of the end of March, translating to a 127.5 percent penetration rate.","East African countries have achieved 100 percent mobile penetration at 199.7 million subscribers, ahead of Africa’s 92 percent but short of the globe’s 111 percent as of the close of last year.

Though inspection of motor vehicles is one of NTSA's core functions, an audit now reveals that equipment in at least 10 of its centres across the country is “no longer useful” and is forcing its officers to undertake manual inspections.

“A visit to the regional offices in Nakuru, Kericho, Kisumu, Kakamega, Eldoret, Mombasa, Voi, Machakos, Nyeri, and Embu revealed that inspection equipment and facilities are either faulty or obsolete and are no longer useful for their intended purposes,” Auditor-General Nancy Gathungu reveals, pointing to one of the major causes of road accidents witnessed in the country.

Thousands of Kenyans have died on Kenyan roads, with the NTSA often shifting blame to drivers and saccos operating public transport vehicles, but the audit now exposes weaknesses within the authority, that could be leading to accidents.

The audit, released this month, notes that NTSA’s inspection centres are old and are forcing officers to undertake manual checks which are not accurate, meaning faulty vehicles could be issued a clean bill of health.

“The officers in the region inspect the motor vehicles manually as the inspection centres were old and subserviced. Manual inspections could not yield accurate inspection reports as the inspectors have a double work of manually inspecting and recording the results in the online platform for reports,” Ms Gathungu notes.","Officials at key motor vehicle inspection centres run by the National Transport and Safety Authority (NTSA) have obsolete equipment and cannot effectively do their job, an audit has revealed, raising concerns about the safety of passengers on the country’s roads.

Instead, the High Court has substituted the amount, which had been ordered by a Magistrate’s court, to Sh300,000 which it terms as reasonable exemplary general damages.

Justice John Onyiego, sitting at the High Court in Garissa, ruled that an award of damages is at the discretion of the trial court but in the same breadth, it must be founded within comparable awards.

“In the judgment (of the magistrate’s court), I am unable to find any comparable authority in which the trial magistrate anchored his reasoning in coming up with the award. It follows that the same was not anchored or supported on any specific law or case law,” ruled Justice Onyiego.

The judge noted that though the appellants-- (Absa Bank Kenya and Absa Life Assurance Kenya)-- had wrongfully deducted Sh10,164 from Manjuu Mubarak Oshe's account, they remedied the illegality through a refund.

“It, therefore, follows that an appropriate amount in reference to the exemplary damages suffered by the respondent ought to have reflected the amount in question as initially wrongfully deducted,” said Justice Onyiego.

In their appeal against the decision of the Magistrate’s court, the appellants argued that the court erred in finding that Mr Oshe was entitled to Sh1.2 million in damages-- which they deemed excessive going by the alleged injury occasioned on him.

They also argued that the Magistrate erred by failing to consider the submissions and judicial authorities on quantum thereby arriving at an erroneous figure.

According to the appellants, the magistrate erred by failing to consider conventional awards for general damages in cases of similar injuries

The appellants also argued that the Magistrate erred by failing to consider that the loss occasioned by Mr Oshe was remedied through a consent filed by the parties. Thus no loss was suffered by him.

On his part, Mr Oshe argued that the appellants recklessly breached their fiduciary duty owed to him by irregularly enrolling him into a fraudulent insurance policy.

He further argued that the malicious manner in which the employee of the appellants enrolled him into a life policy insurance scheme and fraudulently executed contract documents to meet targets set (by the appellants) to bring profit to them (appellants), invited an award of exemplary damages.

At the magistrate’s court, Mr Oshe had told the court that on or about June 4, 2020, the appellants through their staff, employee, and or agent unlawfully and fraudulently enrolled him into Absa’s Life Insurance Protection Plan without his knowledge or consent.","Instead, the High Court has substituted the amount, which had been ordered by a Magistrate’s court, to Sh300,000 which it terms as reasonable exemplary general damages.

The powerful EndFemicideKe protests called for gender justice, while demonstrations against forced evictions and demolitions in informal settlements during the flood season highlighted the plight of marginalised communities. Yet, it is the widespread outrage over the contentious Finance Bill 2024 that truly galvanised the nation, drawing intense scrutiny and support both domestically and globally.

These protests have made history with their groundbreaking use of technology to rally and unite citizens beyond traditional tribal divisions.

The innovativeness, boldness, and resilience of Kenyan Gen Zs and millennials in activism tactics are noteworthy. Technology and social media played crucial roles in enabling broader participation in political discourse, increasing scrutiny of government actions, and empowering a demographic that challenged traditional power structures.

Scores of citizens voiced their frustration, anger, disappointment, opposition, and demands online and organised nationwide protests using hashtags like #EndFemicideKe, #TotalShutdownKenya, #RejectFinanceBill2024, and #OccupyParliament on social media platforms such as TikTok and X. Online petition platforms like Change.org (against the Finance Bill) and Avaaz.org (against femicide) were also used to rally public support.

The year began with massive demonstrations against femicide, driven by alarming statistics and a demand for stronger legal protections and enforcement. January and February saw some of the largest protests in Kenya’s history, with women and allies marching to demand justice for victims and stricter laws to protect women.

Led predominantly by young women and feminists, including many Nguvu Change Leaders playing different roles, these protests highlighted systemic gender-based violence and the need for legislative reforms to ensure the safety of women and equality.

In April, protests erupted over unfair demolitions and evictions following severe flooding, which disproportionately affected vulnerable communities. The evictions were deemed inhumane as many felt brutalised and were left without an alternative place to relocate to, no fair compensation, sufficient notice, or proper consultation.

These protests mark a turning point for Kenya, heralding a new era of collective action and political and social accountability in Kenya that has reshaped public discourse and policy direction.

They reflect deep-seated discontent and growing disillusionment among young Kenyans with existing policies that overlook public participation and fail to address urgent national issues. There is a demand for youth and women to have a meaningful role in shaping the future, not just demanding change but actively steering its course.

The government’s response was criticised as selective and punitive, prompting calls for fairer environmental policies and better disaster management.

The most recent wave of protests has been driven by opposition to the Finance Bill 2024, which proposed significant tax hikes. These demonstrations, marked by a diverse demographic including millennials and mostly Gen Z participants, showcased widespread economic discontent.

The proposed tax increases were seen as burdensome, especially for the younger population struggling with unemployment and economic instability.

The outcome, which saw President Ruto conceding, underscores the growing influence of young people and women in national affairs, though their voices and concerns are often excluded from top decision-making. This has widened the gap between the government and disillusioned citizens who have lost faith and trust in leadership.

In supporting and amplifying these transformative movements, the younger generation and women, civil society organizations (CSOs), the media, and the government have pivotal roles to play. CSOs can provide the necessary organizational infrastructure, resources, and advocacy training to sustain the momentum of these protests, ensuring that young voices are heard and their demands are met.

The media, as a powerful tool for shaping public opinion, can continue to spotlight these movements, foster informed debate, and hold those in power accountable. Meanwhile, the government must embrace a collaborative approach, engaging in constructive dialogue with these young activists and stakeholders to co-create policies and solutions that reflect the diverse interests of all Kenyans.

Together, these efforts can pave the way for long-term solutions, fostering a more equitable and just society where every Kenyan, especially the youth and women, can thrive and participate meaningfully in shaping the nation's future.","Kenya has recently emerged as a beacon of civic and political activism, driven by a historic wave of protests addressing various social and economic grievances.

Taking a business case approach to creating an organisation’s ESG strategy ensures that the targets are realistic and practical and take into account the complexities in the operating environment.

Organisations that integrate ESG or sustainability into their purpose can better manage shocks and disruptions to their business from ESG risks and are less likely to keep shifting their sustainability goalposts. Therefore, connect an ESG strategy to the broader goal of building a sustainable business that delivers returns for shareholders and wider stakeholder groups.

In recent months, some organisations have pulled back on their climate ambitions, including revising the climate or green targets they had set previously. For instance, we have seen some organisations push their net-zero target further, citing various challenges and complexities in their operating environment. Such moves do not instil confidence or build trust with stakeholders and society.

Organisations should take advantage of data and robust scenario planning before setting ESG or sustainability targets to reduce the likelihood of this occurring. Making informed decisions relies on using accurate and verifiable data. Therefore, organisations must ensure that green targets are set with comprehensive measurement, reporting, and verification of the underlying data to inform such decisions. For example, an organisation’s net-zero target should only be set by management once it has measured, reported, and verified its emissions data and developed a strategy for managing the attendant risks and opportunities across its business.

The transition strategy is also where scenario planning should be applied. Organisations do not operate in a vacuum and constantly interact with their environment, both internally and externally.

Therefore, in developing their transition strategy, it is pertinent to incorporate likely responses from internal and external relationships in their operating environment to build scenarios. It will enable them to identify potential geopolitical conflicts, competitor responses or technological changes that could influence their competitive position as they develop their sustainability strategy and set the related targets.

Also, organisations must implement a robust governance process or mechanism for interrogating these targets before communicating to stakeholders.","The process through which organisations develop their environmental, social, and governance (ESG) or sustainability strategy must address business risks and opportunities.

Business Daily,https://www.businessdailyafrica.com/bd/sponsored/kenyan-online-gambling-integration-of-cryptocurrency-4675108,2024-06-30,17:56:41 UTC,Kenyan online gambling market sees growth with integration of cryptocurrency,"The Kenyan online gambling market is experiencing a significant transformation with the integration of cryptocurrency. This trend is opening new opportunities for both players and operators. Understanding the dynamics behind this shift is crucial for staying ahead in the industry.

The rise of cryptocurrency in the online gambling sector has been nothing short of revolutionary. For many, the allure lies in the increased security and anonymity that digital currencies provide.

As a result, Kenya's online gambling market, projected to be significant with estimates suggesting a value close to $100 million in 2024, is poised to benefit from this growing trend.

The number of online gamblers in Kenya is also expected to rise, with Statista predicting 402,000 online sports betting users and 85,000 online casino users by 2029.

How cryptocurrency is reshaping the Kenyan gambling landscape

Cryptocurrency, with its decentralised nature, offers a level of transparency and security that traditional currencies struggle to match. For players in Kenya, this means safer transactions and lower risks of fraud. In the middle of this shift, you find the intriguing concept of a crypto casino, which blends modern digital currency with conventional gaming platforms.

Adopting cryptocurrencies also means that transactions can be processed faster compared to traditional banking methods. This efficiency is particularly appealing to younger generations who are accustomed to the instant gratification provided by digital technologies. It is essential for operators to recognise this shift and adapt accordingly.

Moreover, cryptocurrencies can help mitigate issues related to currency exchange rates and transaction fees, making it easier for international players to participate in Kenyan online casinos. This global reach not only broadens the player base but also increases revenue streams for operators willing to embrace these digital currencies. The decentralised nature of cryptocurrencies also aligns well with the increasing demand for provably fair gaming.

Blockchain technology, which underpins most digital currencies, allows for transparent and tamper-proof record-keeping. This means that players can verify the fairness of games independently, fostering a sense of trust between the operator and the player. As more Kenyans become aware of these benefits, the adoption of cryptocurrency in online gambling is likely to accelerate.

The relevance of cryptocurrency in modern online casinos

One of the key benefits of integrating cryptocurrency into online gambling platforms is the enhanced privacy it offers users. For many Kenyan players, the ability to gamble without revealing personal banking information is a significant advantage. In addition, digital currencies often come with lower transaction fees, making them an economical option for frequent gamers. You can see this in action on platforms like Bombastic Casino which represents a dynamic and exuberant shift towards modern gaming solutions that cater to these financial advantages.

Another critical factor driving the adoption of cryptocurrency is its potential for reducing operational costs for casino operators. Lower transaction fees and faster processing times mean that casinos can operate more efficiently, potentially passing on these savings to their customers in the form of better odds or higher payouts.

This integration also opens up new marketing opportunities. By accepting cryptocurrencies, online casinos can appeal to a broader audience that includes tech-savvy individuals and early adopters of new technologies. This strategic move can significantly enhance customer loyalty and engagement, further driving growth in Kenya's already substantial online gambling market.

The use of cryptocurrencies also enables online casinos to offer a wider range of games and betting options. The fast transaction speeds and low fees associated with digital currencies make it feasible for operators to provide micro-betting opportunities and high-frequency games. This flexibility can be a significant draw for players looking for diverse and exciting gaming experiences, further boosting the appeal of Kenyan online casinos that adopt cryptocurrency.

What players need to know about using cryptocurrency in gambling

For players considering using cryptocurrency at Kenyan online casinos, understanding how these digital currencies work is crucial. Consider the following:

Safe Storage: Get a secure digital wallet to store your cryptocurrency safely. Look for features like two-factor authentication and encryption.

Cryptocurrency Options: Find out which cryptocurrencies the casino accepts. Bitcoin is popular, but others like Ethereum and Litecoin are gaining traction. Each has its own benefits and transaction speeds.

Market Volatility: Be aware that the value of cryptocurrency can change quickly. This can impact your winnings or losses. Stay informed about market trends to manage these risks.

The future of cryptocurrency in Kenya's gambling industry

The integration of cryptocurrency into Kenya's online gambling market represents a significant step forward for the industry. As more operators adopt these digital currencies, it is likely that we will see continued growth and innovation within this sector. Players will benefit from increased security, privacy and convenience while enjoying their favourite games.

Moreover, as regulatory frameworks evolve to accommodate cryptocurrencies, we can expect a more structured and secure environment for all stakeholders involved. This evolution will be crucial in ensuring sustainable growth and maintaining player trust in the long run.","The Kenyan online gambling market is experiencing a significant transformation with the integration of cryptocurrency.

No longer is exercise solely the domain of the youthful and trendy; seniors are increasingly embracing physical fitness.

While ageing is often linked with slowing down, older adults are challenging this stereotype.

Fred Oyugi, a personal trainer and CEO of Japesa Fitness and Adventure in Nairobi, says maintaining an active lifestyle is essential for a healthy and fulfilling life. Exercise, he notes, not only enhances physical health but also boosts mental well-being and emotional resilience.

Whether it's taking a leisurely walk in the park or joining a dance class, there are countless ways to stay active and enjoy life to the fullest.

“While exercise types remain similar across ages, intensity and approach differ. At 60, gentler workouts are essential compared to the more vigorous routines suitable for 40-year-olds,"" he says.

For those in their 60s, light strength training and bodyweight exercises are crucial, he advises.

Regardless of age, Fred stresses the importance of rest.

""Good training is three sessions a week. Rest is also a workout. Rest periods during workouts vary based on age and fitness level. For older women, longer rest periods of one to three minutes between exercises are essential to ensure they can perform the next set effectively without fatigue.

Fred notes that physical activity and regular exercise offer a multitude of benefits for seniors. These include increased energy levels, reduced risk or alleviation of chronic diseases, improved quality of sleep, decreased joint pain, stronger bones and muscles, and enhanced brain health and cognitive function.

“These advantages underscore the importance of staying physically active as we age, promoting overall well-being and a higher quality of life,” he underscores.

Mobility exercises

According to the personal trainer, several highly effective mobility exercises tailored for seniors include gentle neck stretches that involve tilting the head left, right, forward, and backwards to alleviate tension in the neck and upper back.

Seated leg lifts performed in a sturdy chair with feet placed flat on the floor help improve hip and thigh mobility by lifting one leg at a time and holding briefly before lowering.

Hip rotations, whether standing or sitting and using support as necessary, involve circular motions clockwise and counterclockwise to enhance hip mobility and reduce discomfort in the lower back.

Additionally, knee extensions done while seated in an upright position with feet flat on the floor strengthen the quadriceps and improve flexibility in the knees. These exercises are beneficial for seniors seeking to maintain or improve their mobility, contributing to overall physical well-being and quality of life.

Muscle strengthening

Furthermore, Fred highlights the effectiveness of bodyweight workouts for seniors, emphasising their ability to strengthen muscles without relying on external weights.

He notes that exercises like leg workouts can still be beneficial, acknowledging concerns about knee issues that might limit the use of weighted exercises, such as squats. Instead, focusing on bodyweight leg exercises can provide a safer alternative while still promoting strength and mobility in older adults.

“Leg workouts can be challenging for older persons due to knee issues, particularly when it comes to exercises like squats that involve weights. Older adults often already have knee problems, and performing squats with added weights can potentially exacerbate these issues and lead to injuries.

However, leg workouts using just body weight can still be safely incorporated into their exercise routine. This approach allows for strengthening and conditioning the legs without putting undue strain on compromised joints, promoting fitness and mobility while minimising the risk of injury,” he says.

Outdoor exercises

The gym isn't the only arena where his clients thrive; hiking and outdoor activities are integral to his holistic approach to fitness.

“Fitness isn't just about the gym; it's about enjoying life and staying active. So what we do is we prepare them for life after retirement. Preparing mentally is as important as preparing physically,"" he stresses.

Through his guidance, older adults not only build muscle but also fortify their minds against the challenges that come with ageing.

Minding the posture and diet

Posture, another cornerstone of Fred's training, is emphasised to prevent injuries. ""A slight mistake in posture can lead to significant issues,"" he warns, underscoring the importance of proper form in every exercise.

In terms of diet, he advocates for a balanced approach. ""Exercise and diet go hand in hand,"" he asserts. ""What you eat affects how you perform and recover."" He encourages his clients to adopt sustainable eating habits that complement their fitness goals.

Fitness trend

The evolution of fitness demographics is evident to Fred. ""Gone are the days when gyms were dominated by the young,"" he observes. ""Nowadays, older adults are taking charge of their health."" His clientele spans a wide age range, with individuals in their 80s embracing fitness as a lifestyle.

Other workouts include shoulder rolls: Roll your shoulders forward and backward in a slow, controlled manner to improve shoulder mobility and reduce stiffness.","No longer is exercise solely the domain of the youthful and trendy; seniors are increasingly embracing physical fitness.

21m ago 14.45 CEST German inflation drops as European Central Bank mulls further rate cuts German inflation has dropped slightly more than expected to 2.2% year-on-year in June, as the European Central Bank (ECB) considers whether to cut interest rates again. It dropped from 2.4% in May, and was slightly lower than the 2.3% forecast. The ECB has a 2% inflation target, but it has cut borrowing costs because it believes that inflationary pressure is easing. A further reduction in inflation could support that view. Carsten Brzeski, global head of macro at ING, a Dutch investment bank, said the reading keeps the door open to further ECB rate cuts, but added that inflation “remains sticky above 2%. He wrote: Looking ahead, the stickiness of inflation at slightly too high a level looks set to continue as favourable energy base effects are petering out while, at the same time, wages are increasing. With recent new wage demands, it is hard to see German wage growth coming down in the second half of the year. Claus Vistesen, chief eurozone economist at Pantheon Macroeconomics, a consultancy, a September cut is likely. He said: said: Looking further ahead for Germany, we see scope for a further decline in headline inflation to below 2% by August, helping to get a 25 basis point rate cut over the line in September, before a rebound to just under 2.5% by the end of the year.

Photograph: Kirill Kudryavtsev/AFP/Getty Images Mark Zuckerberg’s Meta has breached the EU’s new digital laws with an advertising model that charges users for ad-free versions of Facebook and Instagram, according to the European Commission. Meta launched a “pay or consent” model last year in an effort to comply with the bloc’s data privacy rules, where users pay a monthly fee for an ad-free version of Facebook or Instagram that does not use their personal data for advertising purposes, writes the Guardian’s Dan Milmo. Users who do not pay have, as part of the signing up process for the platforms, consented to their data being used to tailor personalised adverts that appear in their social media feeds. The European Commission, the EU’s executive body, said the model does not comply with the Digital Markets Act, which is designed to rein in big tech companies. The commission issued preliminary findings from an investigation into “pay or consent” on Monday and found the model “forces users to consent” to their data being collected from multiple platforms. It also does not allow users to choose a service that uses less of their data but is broadly similar to the “with adverts” versions of Facebook and Instagram, the commission said.

1h ago 13.57 CEST Unite the union has said that Tata Steel will enter talks about “future investment for its operations and not just redundancies”, after suspending strikes. Other unions have complained that there has been no progress in the last six weeks, but Unite suggested that Tata had changed stance. Tata has stuck to its position that the two blast furnaces must close this year. However, a plan backed by counterpart unions Community and GMB suggested keeping one furnace open for longer while readying a large investment in greener technology (such as a direct reduced iron plant) to convert iron ore to iron, which could then be fed into an electric arc furnace. That plan would preserve jobs on the blast furnaces for several years, and would then require more workers to run in the longer term – although nowhere near the 2,800 employees who could be out of work by the autumn. View image in fullscreen Unite union general secretary Sharon Graham. Photograph: Jacob King/PA Sharon Graham, Unite’s general secretary, said: This is a significant development in the battle to protect jobs and the long-term future of steel making in South Wales. Investment from Labour secured by Unite will be key to the future of the site. This breakthrough would not have come about without the courage of our members at Port Talbot who were prepared to stand up and fight for their jobs. Workers were simply not prepared to stand idly by while steel making ended and their communities were laid to waste. It is essential that these talks progress swiftly and in good faith with the focus on fresh investment and ensuring the long-term continuation of steel making in South Wales. Share

2h ago 12.59 CEST Tata Steel had written to the three main unions representing steelworkers at Port Talbot offering more talks over its plans to cut 2,800 jobs as it closes the blast furnaces if the strike threat were removed. Owner of Port Talbot steelworks offers fresh talks as last furnace faces closure Read more The unions are hopeful that a Labour government would persuade Tata Steel to delay the closure of at least one blast furnace, preserving thousands of jobs for several years. Unite had threatened strike action from 8 July – after the planned closure of the first blast furnace. The other unions were hanging on for a Labour government after 4 July. Shadow business secretary Jonathan Reynolds has already been in talks with the unions and the company in an effort to avert the closures. Alun Davies, national officer for Community, which represents most of the affected steelworkers, said: With thousands of jobs at stake, we welcome Unite’s decision to withdraw their strike action and get back around the table with their sister steel unions. Tata confirmed that if the strike was called off they are ready to resume discussions on a potential [memorandum of understanding], through the multi-union steel committee which is chaired by Community. The truth is Tata never walked away from those discussions, and at our last meeting on 22 May all unions agreed to conclude the negotiations and put the outcome to our members. Community will welcome resuming those discussions, but we regret that zero progress has been made since 22 May. Share

3h ago 12.16 CEST There has been a rush of manufacturing data today. The UK’s purchasing managers’ index (PMI) from S&P Global suggests it is doing better than Europe. The PMI reading came in at 50.9 in June, still well into expansionary territory, in contrast to the two-year contraction in Europe. The reading was worse than the initial flash estimate of 51.4, and down slightly from May’s 22-month high of 51.2. View image in fullscreen Output from the UK manufacturing sector has picked up in recent months. Photograph: S&P Global Rob Dobson, director at S&P Global Market Intelligence, said: The UK manufacturing sector is enjoying its strongest spell of growth for over two years, with June seeing output and new order growth sustained at robust rates similar to May’s recent highs. The performance of the domestic market remains a real positive, providing a ripe source of new contract wins. In contrast, the ongoing weak export performance is concerning, with manufacturers reporting difficulties in securing new business in several key markets including the US, China and mainland Europe. However, that did not stop companies from making job and spending cuts and trying to run down inventories of unsold products, Dobson said. Inflation may be partly behind that: This is coming from a backdrop of renewed cost inflation pressure, with manufacturers’ input prices now rising at the quickest pace since the start of 2023. This renewed upward lurch in manufacturing prices will likely add to concerns over the potential stubbornness of underlying inflationary pressures among hawkish rate setters at the Bank of England.

And now there are renewed questions over the future of the nearby Harland & Wolff site, after its shares were suspended on the London’s junior stock market. It has been forced to temporarily suspend trading in its shares after accounting issues meant it was unable to file audited accounts on time, the Guardian’s Jack Simpson reports. It expects to publish the accounts in the week commencing 8 July, with share trading resuming at that point.

4h ago 11.33 CEST France's Cac 40 up 1.5%; euro gains 0.5% against US dollar France’s Cac 40 index has moderated somewhat: the index is now up by 1.5%. That is still a notable move, but less than the nearly 3% surge earlier. The euro is up by 0.5% today against the US dollar at $1.0766. A hung parliament would make it more difficult for either the far-right National Rally (RN) or the leftwing New Popular Front coalition to win a majority and increase spending. Some economists fear that a spending spree could prompt investors to dump French assets. The chart below is what the pre-election move looked like in the bond markets. The yield on French bonds (which moves inversely to prices) had risen to a seven-month high before the election. #euro 10y Govt bond yields spread #France vs #Germany - chart @bpolitics https://t.co/kc4rEDiZX5 pic.twitter.com/fbACyQgZUH — ACEMAXX ANALYTICS (@acemaxx) July 1, 2024 The gap between the yield on French and German debt had also soared, although it closed after the slightly lower than expected vote share for the RN over the weekend. Via Reuters: The spread between French and German 10-year sovereign bond yields a gauge for the risk premium investors demand to hold French bonds – tightened to 73 basis points (bps), after hitting 85.2 on Friday, its highest level since July 2012. It was less than 50 bps the days before Macron called for snap elections. However, even if the spread narrowed, the yield on French 10-year debt still rose to its highest since November.

4h ago 10.56 CEST On the French election, Swiss investment bank UBS said there is uncertainty over what will happen in the second round because of 250+ “triangular votes”, with second rounds contested by three candidates. But the UBS analysts, led by Claudia Panseri, chief investment officer at UBS Wealth Management France, say that “the probability that no majority emerges from the election appears significant”. (And on that basis they tell investors to avoid overreaction in the coming days.) The reach of the French far right will depend in part on whether other parties work together to stop them, UBS said: By 6pm on 2 July, the candidates will need to confirm if they want to enter the second round or withdraw and lend their support to another candidate. It will also be important to see whether the various parties will give explicit guidance to their voters on which candidate to vote for in the second round in constituencies where their own candidate fared less well. Gabriel Attal, France’s prime minister, has called on members of his party who came in third to withdraw in favor of a “candidate who defends the values of the Republic”. For now, the left is calling on its third-placed candidates to withdraw in order to defeat the RN. But either way, a “period of political instability” is very likely, they write in a note to clients. France’s main stock index may have gained this morning, but UBS is cautious about the implications for company share prices, because uncertainty will be the name of the game for at least a week, and possibly longer. They wrote: The poor showing by Macron’s Ensemble alliance in the first round is likely to mean that French and Eurozone equities struggle to recover some of their recent losses. […] Fiscal worries will also likely remain until there is greater clarity after round two, preventing a larger rebound in stocks vulnerable to fiscal worries, such as financials and defense stocks. We expect European markets to stay volatile given there is still elevated uncertainty heading into the second round. Share

4h ago 10.42 CEST UK mortgage approvals dipped slightly in May, but were right in line with expectations, according to new data from the Bank of England. Net mortgage approvals for house purchases fell from 60,800 in April to 60,000 in May, while approvals for remortgaging decreased slightly from 29,900 to 29,600 over the same period, the Bank said.

5h ago 10.25 CEST Holger Schmieding, chief economist at Berenberg, a German investment bank, said the French election result was “not worse than expected”. Marine Le Pen’s National Rally (RN) and its allies received 33% of the national popular vote, with the leftwing New Popular Front in second with 28%. President Emmanuel Macron’s centrist bloc was third on 20% of the vote. Schmieding said RN’s vote share was two points below opinion polling, meaning “a hung parliament remains the most likely outcome”. RN could still win an absolute majority in the second round on Sunday 7 July, but that “now looks even slightly less likely than it did before”, he wrote in a note to clients. He also noted that the possibility that the leftwing coalition could “take power and implement its costly agenda seems to have receded further”. (Investors have generally not been in favour of the potentially free-spending leftwing coalition.) Schmieding sketches out three scenarios (quoted here in full): Gridlock: The most likely outcome remains a hung parliament in which neither the far right nor the united left nor the Macron’s centrists can muster a majority. In this case, any (new) government would not get much done. Worse than gridlock: Although the united left and RN are polar opposites on issues of migration, culture and identity, they have all opposed Macron’s pro-growth reforms. As a result, we see a risk that Le Pen’s party and parts of the left may still join forces in a hung parliament on a few select issues to soften Macron’s pension reform and enhance the “purchasing power” of citizens, for instance through lower VAT on energy products or via additional subsidies. Marine Meloni: With a significantly lower probability than the first two scenarios, Le Pen’s party may still win a majority of seats and install RN boss Jordan Bardella as prime minister. If so, she would probably focus on winning the 2027 presidential election, staying on the more moderate track which she has signalled during the campaign. She may concentrate on some signature policies (e.g. being tough on immigration) rather than on expensive or disruptive fiscal promises. Put differently, Le Pen may try to largely follow the example of Italy’s prime minister Giorgia Meloni. To do so, she may possibly explain to RN voters after a lengthy fiscal review that most of her original fiscal ideas could only be implemented slowly over time – or only if she became president in 2027. Schmieding sees “a change for the worse” after Macron’s “pro-growth economic reforms”. He thinks they will mean higher spending relative to government income, plus a much more combative relationship with the EU. Share Updated at 10.28 CEST

5h ago 10.10 CEST Back on the French election fall-out, let’s look at what economists have had to say this morning. Marine Le Pen, leader of the victorious National Rally, formerly called for France to leave the euro currency and the EU. She has done her best to distance herself from any anti-euro sentiments in recent times, realising they are unpopular with people whose savings are in euros, but concerns over the future of Europe have been a major part of investor concerns over a far-right government. A hung parliament – as indicated by the first round of voting – would assuage some of those concerns. However, it could also stop Macron from making changes such as pension reforms that might boost economic growth, but which have proven unpopular with voters. Mohit Kumar, chief economist of Jefferies investment bank, said: The result is probably better-than-feared, but not as good as the status three weeks ago pre-elections. We could still be looking at the next few years of political paralysis in France with a stalling of the reform process. However, any fears of Frexit or a euro area breakup would be unfounded. Share

5h ago 10.07 CEST Two-year recession for European manufacturing sector Output from Europe’s manufacturing sector dropped in June as Germany’s economy continued to struggle, according to a closely followed index. That marked two years of contraction for the sector. The purchasing managers’ index (PMI) for the eurozone dropped from 47.3 points in May to 45.8 in June, according to S&P Global. Germany’s enormous manufacturing sector is usually the powerhouse of Europe, but it has now been in contractionary territory for two years, according to the PMI reading. The latest Germany reading for June came in at 43.5, a marked drop from May’s 45.4 reading. That was marginally better than expectations, but remains well below the 50-point mark that denotes expansion. Cyrus de la Rubia, chief economist at Hamburg Commercial Bank, said: We are inclined to see this more as a temporary blip rather than a sign of a prolonged downturn. Manufacturing growth was seen in other parts of the world in June, such as the United States, UK, and India, according to their respective Flash PMI. This global recovery provides a supportive backdrop for Eurozone manufacturers. Additionally, optimism about future production remains as high as it was in May, indicating that businesses are still confident about the coming year. Share

5h ago 09.51 CEST UK house price rises pick up pace slightly in June View image in fullscreen An aerial view of the residential properties in London, in April. Photograph: Anadolu/Getty Images UK house prices rose by 1.5% in the year to June, a slight acceleration compared to 1.3% in the year to May, according to lender Nationwide. During June prices rose by 0.2% to an average of £266,604. The relatively slow pace of increases – certainly compared to the run of the last decade – is mostly down to higher interest rates, according to Robert Gardner, Nationwide’s chief economist. He said: Housing market activity has been broadly flat over the last year, with the total number of transactions down by around 15% compared with 2019 levels. Transactions involving a mortgage are down even more (nearly 25%), reflecting the impact of higher borrowing costs. By contrast, the volume of cash transactions is actually around 5% above pre-pandemic levels. While earnings growth has been much stronger than house price growth in recent years, this hasn’t been enough to offset the impact of higher mortgage rates, which are still well above the record lows prevailing in 2021 in the wake of the pandemic. The biggest price increases were in Northern Ireland, up 4.1% compared with the second quarter of 2023. Across England overall, prices were up 0.6% year-on-year, while Wales and Scotland both saw a 1.4% year-on-year rise. Prices fell 0.3% across southern England in the second quarter compared to a year earlier. Share

5h ago 09.42 CEST Boeing buys supplier Spirit, with Airbus to gain $559m from deal View image in fullscreen Spirit AeroSystems employees look over the first Boeing 787 Dream Liner all-composite developmental nose section. Photograph: Mike Hutmacher/AP Boeing has bought supplier Spirit Aerosystems for $4.7bn, reversing a move 19 years ago to spin out the fuselage manufacturer. The US planemaker is taking control of Spirit in response to a series of manufacturing issues – including a blown-out door panel in January – that have plunged it back into crisis mode just as it thought it was emerging from the shadow of two crashes of its bestselling 737 Max jet. It may not be listed in France, but Toulouse-headquartered Airbus is another big gainer on stock markets this morning. The Amsterdam-listed planemaker may be benefiting from the broader rally, but its shares are up 2.8% after it said it will gain $559m (£441m) in compensation. Airbus will take over manufacturer of fuselage sections for the A350 jet in Kinston, North Carolina, and St Nazaire, France, A220 pylons in Wichita, Kansas, and of the A220’s wings and mid-fuselage in Belfast, Northern Ireland, and Casablanca, Morocco. Boeing chief executive Dave Calhoun, who retires later this year, said: We believe this deal is in the best interest of the flying public, our airline customers, the employees of Spirit and Boeing, our shareholders and the country more broadly. By reintegrating Spirit, we can fully align our commercial production systems, including our safety and quality management systems, and our workforce to the same priorities, incentives and outcomes – centered on safety and quality.

The Guardian,https://www.theguardian.com/technology/article/2024/jul/01/meta-facebook-instagram-eu-digital-markets-act,2024-07-01,12:05:04 UTC,"Meta breaches digital law by charging for ad-free social networks, EU says","Mark Zuckerberg’s Meta has breached the EU’s new digital laws with an advertising model that charges users for ad-free versions of Facebook and Instagram, according to the European Commission.

Meta launched a “pay or consent” model last year in an effort to comply with the bloc’s data privacy rules, under which users pay a monthly fee for an ad-free version of Facebook or Instagram that does not use their personal data for advertising purposes. Users who do not pay consent, as part of the signing up process for the platforms, to their data being used to tailor personalised adverts that appear in their social media feeds.

The European Commission, the EU’s executive body, said the model did not comply with the Digital Markets Act (DMA), which is designed to rein in big tech companies. The commission issued preliminary findings from an investigation into “pay or consent” on Monday and found the model “forces users to consent” to their data being collected from multiple platforms. It also does not allow users to choose a service that uses less of their data but is broadly similar to the “with adverts” versions of Facebook and Instagram, the commission said.

“In the commission’s preliminary view, this binary choice forces users to consent to the combination of their personal data and fails to provide them a less personalised but equivalent version of Meta’s social networks,” it said.

It said in order to comply with the DMA, Meta must launch “equivalent” versions of Facebook and Instagram that use less of people’s data.

A Meta spokesperson said the new model had been designed to comply the DMA and other regulatory demands.

“Subscriptions as an alternative to advertising are a well-established business model across many industries, and we designed subscription for no ads to address several overlapping regulatory obligations, including the DMA. We will continue to engage constructively with the commission,” they said.

The Guardian,https://www.theguardian.com/environment/article/2024/jul/01/north-sea-oil-transition-plan,2024-07-01,10:43:07 UTC,North Sea oil decline: ‘We can’t have a repeat of what happened to 80s miners’,"“In this city, everyone feels the decline of the North Sea,” says Chris Douglas, 39, who has lived in Aberdeen his whole life and began working as a taxi driver in the Granite City 20 years ago. He now has his own cab company, which in the past was entirely reliant on bookings from the oil and gas industry – today it’s “maybe 50%”, he says.

“You only have to look around: there are industrial estates decimated, hotels no longer trading. The good days are long gone,” he says. “And no political party is coming along to say they are going to rejuvenate the industry. There are just different plans for how to close it down.”

The oil and gas fields in the North Sea are in terminal decline. Last year, the oil basin produced 34m tonnes of oil, its lowest since production in the North Sea was established in the 1970s. As its accessible fossil fuels dwindle, big oil companies have pulled out of the ageing oil basin. And despite the government issuing a rush of licences since Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, the amount of oil set to be extracted is rapidly shrinking.

Meanwhile, the climate crisis – fuelled by gas, oil and coal extraction – is accelerating at a frightening speed and the world’s leading scientists and energy analysts are clear: there can be no new oil and gas projects if humanity is to avoid catastrophe.

In the far north-east of Scotland, this combination of factors could spell disaster for the almost 60,000 workers supported by the oil and gas industry, their families and communities. For the past four decades they have prospered on the well-paid, secure jobs North Sea oil has provided. But now they are looking into an abyss.

“Most of my friends went into the North Sea industry because for them, and for their fathers and their grandfathers, it has always been seen as a sure thing. Does the green economy offer that same security, the same pay?” Douglas says.

This is a crucial moment for these communities, according to Joe Rollin, a senior organiser at the union Unite, which represents tens of thousands of oil and gas workers. “We simply can’t let these workers be the coalminers of this generation, with all the devastation to lives and communities that would entail,” he says.

This is the challenge facing politicians in Westminster and Holyrood before this week’s general election. How do they manage the inevitable and urgent decline of North Sea oil and gas – and can they ensure a just transition to new low-carbon jobs that are fully unionised, well-paid and secure?

For Mika Minio-Paluello, a policy officer at the Trades Union Congress (TUC), there is a lot on the line.

“Whatever happens to the people working in North Sea oil and gas, it is being closely watched by those in different industries and sectors – not just across the UK but also in other countries – to see if we can take working people on this journey.

“It is a test case in some ways, for the whole idea of a just transition, of what happens when we decarbonise … we simply can’t have a repeat of what happened to coal workers in the 80s.”

The spectre of the miners’ plight after the pit closures in the 1980s hangs over this debate. The communities that were decimated when the then Conservative prime minister Margaret Thatcher closed the pits and smashed the coalminers’ union never recovered.

Arguably the stakes now are even higher. The escalating climate crisis demands a rapid end to fossil fuel production, but the populist right across Europe is on the rise and it has climate action in their sights – describing it as a remote, elite project being done at the expense of ordinary workers.

The UK’s main political parties are divided on the issue. The Conservative party is still promising to “max out” oil and gas in the North Sea by granting licences for new exploration every year. Meanwhile, Labour has promised to put an end to new licences, and raise taxes on the large profits being made by companies operating in the North Sea. The party is also promising “not a single job” will be lost during the transition.

In response, the Scottish National party has U-turned on its pledge to phase out fossil fuel licences and is trying to tread a “middle ground”, saying it will approve licences if they meet strict climate conditions – although most experts struggle to see how this could be possible.

Nigel Farage, the leader of the insurgent populist Reform UK party, is waiting to capitalise, vowing at his manifesto launch last month to axe net zero policies and fast-track licences to open up the North Sea.

“If we fail to do this transition in a way that takes communities with us, then we leave the way open for Farage and the far right,” said Minio-Paluello. “The risk of the far right culture wars building a wave of support on the back of our failure is very, very real.”

There is little doubt the writing is on the wall for the industry. Experts point out that the number of jobs supported directly and indirectly by oil and gas has more than halved in the past decade – from 441,000 to 214,00 – during which time the government has issued roughly 400 new licences in six licensing rounds.

According to the former head of the oil and gas regulator, new licences would make a difference to gas production only “around the edges”. Even BP’s former chief executive has said North Sea drilling is “not going to make any difference” to Britain’s energy security.

Ajay Parmar, a director at ICIS, a commodity data provider, says:“The UK’s oil supply decline has been in the works for decades. Labour’s policy will hasten the decline but only marginally.”

Critics of the Tory pitch to “max out” North Sea oil claim it is part of a culture war framing what will only result in workers being stranded in a declining industry with no plan to save their livelihoods or communities.

Analysts and trade unions agree that unless it is managed properly, the transition will have a devastating impact on the Scottish economy. According to a report by the consultancy EY, which was commissioned by the Scottish government, North Sea workers have an annual average salary of £88,000, while those working in the oil and gas supply chain earn an average of £51,000 a year. This is well above the average annual salary of £29,000 in Scotland – and above the £42,600 average wage of employees in the clean energy sector, according to figures from the Energy and Climate Intelligence Unit.

As high-wage oil jobs are replaced with clean energy roles, the gross value of Scotland’s employment sector could plummet from £19bn a year in 2019 to £12bn by 2050, according to the report.

For people like Dale Green, who has been working on the rigs for the past 22 years, those statistics could be life-changing.

“When I was growing up, the only option for me really if I wanted a good job, good money, was to work on the rigs,” says the 39-year-old scaffolder. “It has allowed me to move on from the council estate where I grew up and to be able to afford a decent life – to look after my children, get a house, get a car.”

Dale fears that unless the transition is properly managed the chances he has had will be denied to future generations.

“Taking away opportunities that someone like me has enjoyed, a scaffolder from a working-class community who grew up on a council estate, it could just decimate certain areas,” said Green.

If it wins the election, Labour plans to set up a taskforce with Scottish Labour, the big energy companies and the unions to “secure a future for every oil and gas worker”. It says the new jobs will mostly be in renewables, carbon capture and storage, and hydrogen.

The shadow climate secretary, Ed Miliband, has promised to base Labour’s planned state-backed green power firm, Great British Energy, in Scotland. And part of the party’s £7bn “wealth fund” will be earmarked for wind power.

But Labour has dropped its expertly costed £28bn-a-year green investment pledge, sparking concerns among unions and environmental campaigners about whether it had set aside sufficient funds to ensure a smooth transition from fossil fuels.

Critics say the party’s plans are vague, that there is little or no industrial base in Scotland, and that there are few renewable jobs to transfer workers to. They argue a well-funded, pro-active industrial strategy will be required to create the jobs in wind turbine manufacturing, installation and maintenance, as well as in the wider supply chain for renewables.

Unite says much more needs to be done. Its general secretary, Sharon Graham, refused to sign off the party’s manifesto at its “clause V” last month – in part because of fears Labour’s plans for oil and gas workers in the North Sea were too vague.

“We should not be letting go of one rope until we have hold of another,” Graham said earlier this year. “These types of transitions must have workers at the heart. Unite will not stand by and let these workers be thrown on the scrap heap.”

The union is running a grassroots “No ban without a plan” campaign across north-east Scotland, urging Labour to outline more detailed and funded proposals before banning new licences. Last week, more than 200 small businesses published a letter backing the campaign and calling on Labour to spell out exactly where the jobs will come from.

Previously, this position might have seen trade unions pitted against climate groups calling for a rapid winding down of the industry. However, behind the scenes there has been an unlikely alliance emerging.

Last week, 60 leading climate organisations including Greenpeace UK, Friends of the Earth England, Wales and Northern Ireland, Oxfam UK and Extinction Rebellion signed an open letter calling for a “clear and funded” transition plan for workers and communities reliant on the oil and gas industry.

The letter, which was sent to all party leaders, is based on a report created in consultation with workers and backed by Unite, the National Union of Rail, Maritime and Transport Workers (RMT), the Public and Commercial Services Union (PCS), and Unison Scotland.

A spokesperson for Unite says the union welcomed “support from the climate movement”.

“We are fully behind a transition to greener energy, but this must be a fair transition, one that has workers and communities at its heart … we will continue to work with climate groups who are calling for ambitious government action on a just transition.”

Ruby Earle, from the campaign group Platform, which helped coordinate the letter, says it shows “how far the climate movement and unions have come in building relationships”.

“Government support for a just transition cannot be an afterthought. A clear and funded industrial strategy, alongside publicly owned energy, is not only essential for workers, communities, and the millions of people living in fuel poverty, but also to ensure the transition happens within climate limits.”

Jake Molloy, a former oil and gas worker and trade unionist for almost 20 years, who now sits on the Scottish government’s Just Transition Commission, is at the sharp end of this emerging coalition.

“If I had suggested, 20 years ago [to his colleagues in the industry] that they go and meet Greenpeace or another climate group, they would have thought I meant for a fight because these groups were seen as wanting to destroy our jobs, our communities.”

But he says that has changed in recent years, with a huge amount of work going on behind the scenes. Molloy says this has resulted in more climate groups recognising that the necessary transition away from fossil fuels cannot be done at the expense of ordinary working people. At the same time, some unions and workers have accepted that the transition is necessary and – if done correctly – positive.

“More and more people on both sides are realising that this is an industrial revolution on an unprecedented scale and that we need change – change so fundamental as to strip away the ideology that we’ve worked in for the last 40 years.”

Molloy warns that many of the much-heralded “new jobs” in renewables do not exist in Scotland – citing a recent windfarm development that has been built, installed and maintained entirely by overseas companies and governments.

Tessa Khan, the director of campaign group Uplift, says the next government needs to “get everyone around the table – the Scottish government, trade unions, worker representatives and affected communities – to come up with a coherent plan that works in everyone’s interests”.

Crucially, she says, the transition plans must be taken out of the hands of the oil and gas industry.

“The majority of operators in the basin invest nothing in UK renewable energy, but nor are they investing in UK oil and gas production. The record profits of recent years have gone to their shareholders, not to investment in the transition. [They] aren’t interested in creating clean jobs and growing the UK economy but in making as much money as they can for themselves, for as long they can get away with it.”

Last month the supreme court in London ruled the climate impact of burning oil and gas must be taken into account when deciding whether to approve projects.

Experts say this is likely to be another nail in the coffin of North Sea oil and gas, making it it harder to secure new licences. It could even threaten some of those that have been approved, including the controversial Rosebank oil and gas field, to be operated by the Norwegian company Equinor.

A Labour source said if the party did form the next government, and Rosebank was still in the balance, then ministers could refuse the remaining consents it needed to operate.

Molloy, who has spent years working on a just transition for his colleagues in the industry, says whatever the result in the election it is essential that politicians and corporations are not able to pit those worried about the climate crisis against those who want to ensure a decent future for workers, their families and communities.

“I‘ve got four grandsons who will never forgive me if I get this wrong, and I’ve been trying for considerable time to get it right, because their future – and that of millions around the world – relies on us getting this right.”","There are just different plans for how to close it down.”The oil and gas fields in the North Sea are in terminal decline.

The Guardian,https://www.theguardian.com/business/article/2024/jul/01/boeing-to-buy-supplier-spirit-aerosystems-deal,2024-07-01,08:11:32 UTC,Boeing to buy supplier Spirit AeroSystems in $4.7bn deal,"Boeing has agreed a $4.7bn (£3.7bn) deal to buy the parts supplier it sold nearly 20 years ago, as it seeks to improve safety on its production lines after a panel blew off an Alaska Airlines-operated plane mid-flight earlier this year.

The under-pressure US planemaker will buy Spirit Aerosystems, which supplies it with fuselage and wing parts, as it attempts to improve safety and quality in its manufacturing processes.

Talks to buy back Spirit began just weeks after a door panel blew out in mid-air on one of Boeing’s 737 Max 9s in January, shortly after it took off from Portland, Oregon.

Investigations by the US safety regulator later discovered the panel appeared to be missing four key bolts. The National Transportation Safety Board said the four bolts were removed while workers repaired damaged rivets last year at Boeing’s facility in Renton, Washington.

The deal to bring Spirit back in house marks a shift away from Boeing outsourcing key components for its planes. Spirit was spun off from Boeing in 2005 but it still accounts for about 70% of all of its orders, with roughly 25% coming from Airbus – Boeing’s arch-rival.

The Boeing president and chief executive, Dave Calhoun, said: “By reintegrating Spirit, we can fully align our commercial production systems, including our safety and quality management systems, and our workforce to the same priorities, incentives and outcomes – centred on safety and quality.”

Airbus will take over the part of Spirit’s business in Northern Ireland that makes wings and fuselage for its A220 jet. Spirit is one of Northern Ireland’s largest manufacturing employers, with about 3,500 staff across the country.

About 40% of Spirit jobs in Northern Ireland are linked to production for companies including Bombardier and Rolls-Royce, and Airbus has said it will aim to sell some of these parts.

Boeing will pay Airbus $559m in compensation to take over operations at four of its plants, including the plant in Belfast.

The total transaction value is about $8.3bn when Spirit’s net debt is included, Boeing said. Spirit shareholders will receive $37.50 a share as part of the deal.

It was revealed on Sunday that the US Department of Justice is poised to charge Boeing with fraud. However, plans to offer the planemaker a plea deal – according to sources familiar with the matter – have infuriated the loved ones of hundreds of passengers who died in two fatal crashes five years ago.

Boeing will be granted until the end of this week to decide whether it will plead guilty to the charge and avoid trial, officials told families of those onboard the fatal Lion Air flight 610 and Ethiopian Airlines flight 302, which claimed 346 lives.

Attorneys representing the relatives accused the federal government of cooking up “another sweetheart plea deal” with Boeing.","Boeing has agreed a $4.7bn (£3.7bn) deal to buy the parts supplier it sold nearly 20 years ago, as it seeks to improve safety on its production lines after a panel blew off an Alaska Airlines-operated plane mid-flight earlier this year.

The Guardian,https://www.theguardian.com/money/article/2024/jul/01/uk-house-prices-nationwide-mortgage-interest-rates-wages-inflation,2024-07-01,11:15:30 UTC,"UK house prices still unaffordable for many people, says Nationwide","House prices in the UK remain unaffordable for many households despite wages rising above inflation for the typical earner, Nationwide has said.

Britain’s largest building society said prices had risen slightly in June amid the impact of higher mortgage costs, with a 0.2% month-on-month increase.

On an annual basis house price growth accelerated from 1.3% in May to 1.5% in June, leaving prices about 3% below the record high set in summer 2022. The average price of a UK home was £266,064 in June, Nationwide said.

House prices in the UK fell last year as households came under pressure from 14 consecutive interest rate rises from the Bank of England, but they remain at historically high levels relative to earnings. Prices returned to growth earlier this year, but activity has been constrained by persistently higher borrowing costs and prices remaining unaffordable for many households.

Robert Gardner, the Nationwide chief economist, said mortgage rates were still well above the record lows of 2021 and that rising costs had outstripped the benefit from stronger levels of average pay growth in recent months.

“As a result, housing affordability is still stretched. Today, a borrower earning the average UK income buying a typical first-time buyer property with a 20% deposit would have a monthly mortgage payment equivalent to 37% of take-home pay – well above the long run average of 30%,” he said.

Separate figures from the Bank of England revealed a slowdown in housing market activity in May as people borrowed £1.2bn of mortgage debt, down from £2.2bn in April. Net mortgage approvals for house purchases also fell slightly from 60,800 in April to 60,000 in May.

Official figures show average annual wage growth in the three months to April was 6%, above the rate of inflation, which fell back to the Bank’s target of 2% in May after reaching a peak of 11% in October 2022, the highest level in four decades.

The figures come as Labour and the Conservatives promise to boost housing affordability in their manifestos for Thursday’s general election, including pledges to build millions of new homes and support households with raising deposits and accessing cheaper mortgages.

Since 2010, despite a succession of government pledges, the average age of a first-time buyer in the UK has risen, rents have soared, homelessness has more than doubled and housebuilding targets have been missed.","House prices in the UK remain unaffordable for many households despite wages rising above inflation for the typical earner, Nationwide has said.

The Guardian,https://www.theguardian.com/politics/article/2024/jul/01/twice-as-many-britons-want-tax-rises-as-want-cuts-survey-finds,2024-07-01,10:57:16 UTC,"Twice as many Britons want tax rises as want cuts, survey finds","Twice as many Britons support tax increases to pay for public services as those who believe they should be reduced even if it means further public service cuts, according to new a report.

A study released by abrdn Financial Fairness Trust, a research body set up by the fund manager, said the public are willing to support policies that they don’t think will benefit their own finances, despite almost two in five (39%) of households now classed as having serious financial difficulties. The number of households with finances in distress has increased by 2.9 million since the last election in 2019, when 28% were in that situation.

About a third of the 5,572 people surveyed said they supported raising their taxes if it benefitted other people with more hours of free childcare, cheaper energy tariffs for lower-income households and an increase in child benefit.

Mubin Haq, the trust’s chief executive, said: “People realise in terms of what the parties are promising on public services that there is a massive gap on what’s needed and what money is available. That is why the public backs these tax rises, because they would rather have that than even more deterioration of public services.”

Both parties have ruled out tax rises for income tax and VAT, while the Conservatives have said they would knock 2p off national insurance contributions, cut stamp duty and give a tax break to pensioners.

In June, the Guardian reported that the Labour party has been drawing up options to raise money to rebuild public services with extra wealth taxes.

The next government will have to implement further cuts of between £10bn and £20bn on unprotected Whitehall departments if it wants to reduce debt and avoid raising taxes, according to the Institute for Fiscal Studies (IFS).

However, the head of the IFS, Paul Johnson, said a Labour government would raise taxes or soften debt rules before it embarked on another round of cuts. Johnson said the pressures on public spending were so powerful that he could not envisage a Labour chancellor making cuts to balance the books.

Prof Sharon Collard, chair in personal finance at the University of Bristol, said: “The findings clearly show that people in the UK have much more nuanced views on these key election issues than the media headlines would sometimes have us believe. They understand there are trade-offs between what is good for their own household finances and what is good for the country overall.”","Twice as many Britons support tax increases to pay for public services as those who believe they should be reduced even if it means further public service cuts, according to new a report.

The Guardian,https://www.theguardian.com/business/article/2024/jul/01/harland-and-wolff-suspends-trading-accounts-belfast,2024-07-01,09:29:14 UTC,Harland & Wolff temporarily suspends trading as it delays accounts,"The shipbuilder Harland & Wolff has been forced to temporarily suspend trading in its shares after accounting issues meant it was unable to file audited accounts on time.

The Aim-listed company, which owns the shipyard where the Titanic was built, said on Monday that it would suspend trading with immediate effect because accounts had not been filed.

It expects to publish the accounts in the week commencing 8 July, with share trading resuming at that point.

The Belfast-based shipbuilder was plunged into uncertainty last month when it was reported that the UK government was witholding the approval of a £200m loan guarantee promised in December to shore up its finances.

The update on Monday said that because of the “multi-year and complex nature” of some of its contracts, it had been in “extensive discussions” with auditors over how best to record revenues over the duration of a build programme.

It said that this was particularly relevant when assessing incomes from its seven-year contract with the Spanish shipbuilder Navantia to assist in the construction of fleet support ships for the Royal Navy, a deal that is expected to net the UK company £750m.

It added: “The assessment of the split in revenues between current year’s revenues and deferred revenues has caused a delay to the audit process and hence the publication of the company’s annual report and audited financial statements.”

The company was able to publish unaudited accounts in which it posted an operating loss of £24.7m for the 12 months until 31 December 2023, an improvement on a £58.5m loss a year earlier. Revenues increased from £27.8m in 2022, to £86.9m this year.

In May, the GMB union wrote to the chancellor warning that any decision to block the £200m loan guarantee that had been offered to Harland & Wolff would put jobs at threat.

The letter was prompted by reports that the government was looking to withdraw support for a £200m loan facility Harland & Wolff had applied for through UK Export Finance. The money would allow it to borrow to pay off expensive debts owed to Riverstone Credit Partners, a US investor.

In the update, the company said further work was continuing on the facility and it expected that a decision would be made after Thursday’s general election.

It added: “Should there be any material delays to securing the facility post the general election, the company’s ability to execute new and large contracts would be adversely affected.”

Harland & Wolff also owns ports across England and Scotland, including Methil on the Firth of Forth, Appledore in North Devon and Arnish Point on the Isle of Lewis.","The shipbuilder Harland & Wolff has been forced to temporarily suspend trading in its shares after accounting issues meant it was unable to file audited accounts on time.

The Guardian,https://www.theguardian.com/money/article/2024/jul/01/millions-to-pay-lower-summer-energy-bills-as-uk-price-cap-drops,2024-07-01,04:00:41 UTC,Millions to pay lower summer energy bills as UK price cap drops,"Millions of households will pay lower gas and electricity bills this summer as the energy price cap for Great Britain falls by £122 a year to the equivalent of £1,568 for the typical annual charge from today.

However, the latest cap applies only from July until the end of September, and bills are expected to rise again this winter, leaving millions struggling to heat their homes.

Monday’s adjustment reflects lower costs in the wholesale gas and electricity markets – but bills are still more than £500 a year higher than they were before Russia’s war on Ukraine upended global energy prices.

National Energy Action (NEA) has estimated that about 5.6 million households in Great Britain will remain in fuel poverty over the summer, even with lower prices.

Adam Scorer, NEA’s chief executive, said: “Any drop in energy bills is welcome, but modest falls in summer look set to be wiped out by bigger rises in autumn when people will need to put the heating back on.”

The energy price cap is expected to rise by 10% to £1,723 a year from October, according to analysts at the energy consultancy Cornwall Insight, as wholesale markets have climbed higher. It expects bills to remain at a similar level into the first months of 2025.

Analysts at the Energy and Climate Intelligence Unit (ECIU), a thinktank, have warned that energy prices are likely to remain significantly higher than they were before the Russian invasion for the rest of the decade.

The conflict has ended Europe’s gas pipeline imports from Russia, which was once its largest source of gas. This has left European markets more exposed to global energy price fluctuations as it relies more on imports from the US and the Middle East.

Europe’s gas market prices were lower in the early months of the year after a relatively mild winter, allowing energy bills to fall this summer. But markets have started to climb again, in part due to stronger gas demand from Asian economies, which will spell higher bills again this winter.

Simon Cran-McGreehin, the head of analysis at the ECIU, said: “The UK’s high dependence on gas for electricity generation and heating has cost bill payers £2,000 so far during the gas crisis, and the economy as a whole tens of billions of pounds.”

“Commonsense measures like investing in insulating the poorest homes, switching to electric heat pumps and fast-tracking British renewables will leave us less vulnerable to the whims of the international gas markets,” he said.

The consumer group Which? has urged households to take a meter reading as close to 30 June as possible “to ensure you don’t pay over the odds for any energy used after the new price cap takes effect”.

Scorer said: “Whoever is in power on 5 July inherits a fuel poverty crisis that causes misery, despair, ill-health and early death. A new government will need a new plan. Social tariffs to make energy affordable. ‘Help to repay’ programmes to reduce the debt burden. Energy efficiency schemes to build fuel poverty out of the homes of the most vulnerable.”","Millions of households will pay lower gas and electricity bills this summer as the energy price cap for Great Britain falls by £122 a year to the equivalent of £1,568 for the typical annual charge from today.

The Guardian,https://www.theguardian.com/politics/article/2024/jun/30/uk-and-eu-horticulture-firms-warn-of-harm-caused-by-post-brexit-border-delays,2024-06-30,17:13:36 UTC,UK and EU horticulture firms warn of harm caused by post-Brexit border delays,"Nurseries and garden centres across Britain and Europe have warned that new post-Brexit border posts are not working properly and are leading to delays, damage and significant extra costs for importers bringing plants into Britain.

The Horticultural Trade Association, which represents 1,400 garden retailers and growers in the UK, has joined forces with several European trade bodies to write an open letter to call for urgent solutions, warning the new system was adding more than 25% to import costs.

It said the checks introduced in April had held up a significant number of deliveries at the border, sometimes for as long as 44 hours, while difficulties carrying out inspections were increasing the chance of harmful pests and plant diseases entering Britain.

The new rules mean certain plant and animal products coming into Britain from the EU must now be checked at border posts situated in or nearby British ports. Previously, plants were inspected in spot checks once they had reached nurseries.

The trade bodies said the new system is causing delays and piling on costs. One haulage company said it experienced 93 hours of driver waiting time in the first week of the checks, costing it £38,000 in extra pay.

The company calculated that this would add £1.5m to its logistics bill over the next year, an increase of 25%.

Another company reported three of its trailers filled with plants were held at a border post for 44 hours after a software problem. This resulted in the majority of plants dying or wilting and the loads being rejected by the end customer.

The letter was signed by International Flower Trade Association, whose membership accounts for 80% of the total value of worldwide trade of flowers and pot plants, as well as VGB, the Dutch association of wholesalers in floricultural products.

It comes as importers are already having to deal with increased costs on moving plant and animal products to Britain because companies are now charged for inspections of goods at the border.

The letter said in some cases providers could be paying £1,740 extra to bring in a mixed load of 12 different consignments of plants, making trade unviable for many small businesses.

Under the new Brexit rules, plants for planting have been categorised as high-risk, meaning much higher rates of inspection than for businesses that import meat and dairy, which are classified as medium risk.

Importers claim the posts are too small to process goods from multiple lorries, and they said there is insufficient equipment at nearly all facilities to unload plants such as large trees or those large plants not stacked into plant trolleys.

Before the checks came in April, imported plants were held at nurseries and farms in controlled conditions before checks on site by government inspectors.

Under the new rules these checks take place almost exclusively at both government-run and privately run border posts. The government has insisted that this would enhance the country’s biosecurity by stopping harmful diseases entering the country and damaging plants and crops.

However, the letter raised concerns about the standard of checks at border posts.

It claimed loads were being “observed, rather than intensely scrutinised”, which was increasing the chance of diseases being missed, while the lack of information on what was being checked was leaving some end customers in the dark about the health of plants they received.

In one case, checks on a load of 50 mature olive trees were abandoned because of difficulties unloading. The letter said: “Olive trees are a well-known host for Xylella fastidiosa, a very high-risk and damaging bacterial disease.

“The end customer would have expected and paid for the at-border check … Yet the business received no information about what had happened and why, nor was it aware that those trees had an incomplete check.”

The government said it was working closely with traders to ensure checks are completed efficiently and swiftly, while also publishing guidance on how to reduce delays for companies.

It added that checks were handled by fully trained staff to standard operating procedures ensuring inspections were undertaken safely.

The other signatories to the letter were the European Nurserystock Association, Royal Anthos (the Dutch Association for Nursery Stock and Flower Bulbs), VBN (the Dutch Flower Auctions Association) and Transport en Logistiek Nederland (the Dutch Transport & Logistics Association).","Nurseries and garden centres across Britain and Europe have warned that new post-Brexit border posts are not working properly and are leading to delays, damage and significant extra costs for importers bringing plants into Britain.

The Guardian,https://www.theguardian.com/business/article/2024/jul/01/london-investment-bankers-bonuses-interest-rates,2024-07-01,05:00:44 UTC,London investment bankers to rake in bigger bonuses after two-year slump,"London’s investment bankers are expected to rake in bigger bonuses this financial year, as the City begins to recover from a two-year slump in deals caused by surging interest rates.

Demand for investment banking services – such as facilitating mergers and acquisitions, advising companies and governments on fundraising, and underwriting new stock and bonds – was hit by a sharp increase in borrowing rates after the pandemic, as central banks acted to tame runaway inflation. Jobs and pay were cut as investment banks sought to reduce costs.

But the rate hike cycle has ended, with the UK and US expected to begin reducing the cost of borrowing before Christmas. Forecasters say the recent increase in dealmaking is likely to be felt during the spring bonus season.

“The outlook for 2024 is brightening after a promising first quarter and there are signs of capital markets activity thawing after a two-year freeze,” Dartmouth Partners, a recruiter for banks, consulting firms and startups, said in its annual compensation survey covering London investment bankers.

That is likely to mean bigger bonuses for investment bankers at the London offices of “bulge bracket” firms including JP Morgan, Goldman Sachs, and Deutsche Bank, rewarding those who managed to keep their jobs and wait out nearly two years of falling payouts.

“It feels like there’s more of a an upswing happening,” the Dartmouth Partners founder, Logan Naidu, told the Guardian. “Even if the revenue is not quite there, the activity is and I would suspect that compensation would go up on last year. Will it be back up to where it was in 2021-22? I doubt it is going to be that good. But I think it will be better than than last year.”

Naidu said the UK’s decision to scrap the banker bonus cap, which previously limited bonuses to 100% of salaries, would probably mean that salary rises could be replaced with larger bonuses over the long term. “What might happen is base pay starts to get a bit more suppressed, and variable comp starts to become a larger part of the narrative again, which is probably good news for the banks in terms of how they manage their cost base.”

There is still time for most investment bankers to build their bonus pots. While junior analysts will be paid out at the end of the summer, bonus decisions for higher-level staff will be made at the end of the year.

Dartmouth Partners released data showing average pay tumbled last year across most investment banking positions at eight of the major investment banks, ranging from junior-level analysts to more senior associates and vice-president roles.

While lower-paid analysts took home bonuses worth an average of £44,267 in 2023 – marking a near 50% increase compared with a year earlier – mid-tier associates’ bonus payouts fell by nearly a fifth to £80,065 on average, sending their total pay down 8.3% to £213,940.

Meanwhile, some vice-presidents had their bonuses slashed by 22% to £135,183, reducing total average pay by 11.8% to £303,204.

The survey, which interviewed more than 250 London-based bankers – working at Goldman Sachs, JP Morgan, UBS, Barclays, Morgan Stanley, Citi, Deutsche Bank and Bank of America – found that a number of bankers working at European firms were hoping to jump ship to their American rivals, which tend to offer higher overall compensation.

But even Goldman Sachs cut pay for its vice-presidents by 7.6% on average, while its associates were hit by an 8.3% drop. JP Morgan vice-presidents experienced a 7% cut and associate pay fell by 4.6%.

London-based vice-presidents at Morgan Stanley were hit by the largest drop in total pay on average last year, with it falling nearly by 26.8%, followed by Bank of America where vice-president-level pay fell 23.5%.

Global banks collectively cut more than than 600,000 jobs in 2023, making it one of the biggest years for redundancies since the 2007-08 financial crisis.

“Even though bonuses have been poor, many bankers said they are happy to still have a job,” the survey said.

“Even though bonuses have been poor, many bankers said they are happy to still have a job,” the survey said.","['slump', 'bonus', 'bigger', 'banks', 'morgan', 'london', 'bonuses', 'pay', 'bank', 'average', 'investment', 'twoyear', 'vicepresidents', 'bankers', 'rake']",https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b956a938271bbf8c3d83939aab3c8ef708720d05/0_143_5644_3388/master/5644.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=f4bb4e2af119436694034a2592470dc1,False,london 's invest banker expect rake bigger bonus financi year citi begin recov twoyear slump deal caus surg interest rate demand invest bank servic - facilit merger acquisit advis compani govern fundrais underwrit new stock bond - hit sharp increas borrow rate pandem central bank act tame runaway inflat job pay cut invest bank sought reduc cost rate hike cycl end uk us expect begin reduc cost borrow christma forecast say recent increas dealmak like felt spring bonus season `` the outlook brighten promis first quarter sign capit market activ thaw twoyear freez '' dartmouth partner recruit bank consult firm startup said annual compens survey cover london invest banker like mean bigger bonus invest banker london offic `` bulg bracket '' firm includ jp morgan goldman sach deutsch bank reward manag keep job wait near two year fall payout `` it feel like there 's upsw happen '' dartmouth partner founder logan naidu told guardian `` even revenu quit there activ would suspect compens would go last year back doubt go good think better last year '' naidu said uk 's decis scrap banker bonus cap previous limit bonus salari would probabl mean salari rise could replac larger bonus long term `` what might happen base pay start get bit suppress variabl comp start becom larger part narrat again probabl good news bank term manag cost base '' still time invest banker build bonus pot junior analyst paid end summer bonus decis higherlevel staff made end year dartmouth partner releas data show averag pay tumbl last year across invest bank posit eight major invest bank rang juniorlevel analyst senior associ vicepresid role lowerpaid analyst took home bonus worth averag ps - mark near increas compar year earlier - midtier associ ' bonus payout fell near fifth ps averag send total pay ps meanwhil vicepresid bonus slash ps reduc total averag pay ps survey interview londonbas banker - work goldman sach jp morgan ub barclay morgan stanley citi deutsch bank bank america - found number banker work european firm hope jump ship american rival tend offer higher overal compens even goldman sach cut pay vicepresid averag associ hit drop jp morgan vicepresid experienc cut associ pay fell skip past newslett promot sign busi today free daili newslett get set work day - well point busi news analysi need everi morn enter email address sign privaci notic newslett may contain info chariti onlin ad content fund outsid parti inform see newslett may contain info chariti onlin ad content fund outsid parti inform see privaci polici use googl recaptcha protect websit googl privaci polici term servic appli newslett promot londonbas vicepresid morgan stanley hit largest drop total pay averag last year fall near follow bank america vicepresidentlevel pay fell global bank collect cut job make one biggest year redund sinc financi crisi `` even though bonus poor mani banker said happi still job '' survey said chang averag compens vicepresid bank america barclay citi deutsch bank goldman sach jp morgan morgan stanley ub
The Guardian,https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/article/2024/jul/01/artists-target-wimbledons-strawberries-and-cream-image-over-link-to-barclays,2024-07-01,07:22:41 UTC,Artists target Wimbledon’s ‘strawberries and cream image’ over link to Barclays,"Hundreds of ads on commercial billboards, the tube and bus shelters near Wimbledon have been replaced with artwork taking aim at the tournament’s sponsorship with Barclays over its ties to fossil fuels and companies supplying arms to Israel.

Tournament organisers have come under pressure to drop the bank as a sponsor by climate groups and anti-war activists who accuse Barclays of using the event to “cover up its role” in funding the climate crisis and to “hide from accountability for its role in enabling Israel’s war crimes”.

As the 2024 championships begin on Monday, more than 300 public adverts near the All England Lawn Tennis and Croquet Club have been covered with spoof posters mimicking advertising for Wimbledon and Barclays in a guerrilla action carried out by the campaign group Brandalism.

One poster created by Darren Cullen shows a tennis player bleeding out on the court beside a crater with the words “From Gaza to global warming, we’re making a killing.” Another piece by Anarcha Art shows two hands, one of a tennis player and the other of a banker, meeting with the words: “Partners in climate crime and genocide.”

Kit Speedwell, a spokesperson from Brandalism, said: “Wimbledon’s cherished strawberries and cream image has been thoroughly sullied by its decision to partner with Barclays, the most toxic bank in Europe, while the bank continues to pour millions into the arms trade and fossil fuel companies driving climate chaos.

“Wimbledon must stop providing cover for Barclays’ grotesque lack of morals and immediately end the sponsorship deal.”

Matt Bonner, one of the artists involved, said: “Barclays continues to bankroll fossil fuel companies like Shell and BP, which is why we’re showing Wimbledon that this partnership is an endorsement of the bank’s complicity in climate breakdown. There’s no tennis on a dead planet.”

Lindsay Grime, who created a spoof advert for the campaign that shows blood-stained cash flowing out of the pockets of a Wimbledon player, said the sponsorship deal is “serving [Barclay’s] mission to normalise what they do via a veneer of social acceptability”, adding that “Wimbledon needs to wake up to the fact that Barclays is a totally toxic partner, sullying their tournament by association.”

On Monday, protesters chanted “Free Palestine” outside Centre Court as those attending the tournament queued to enter the venue. One speaker said through a megaphone: “We’re here outside Wimbledon, not to stop you enjoying your tennis. We’re here because we want you to know that Barclays, a major sponsor of Wimbledon, must be ostracised.”

Rafela Fitzhugh, 55, was among those protesting. “Barclays are a massive funder of companies investing in the bombing of Gaza and we are putting pressure on them to stop,” she said. “They’re pumping money into the slaughter of women and children.”

“They only got out of apartheid South Africa when there was enough pressure put on them and that’s what we’re doing now,” she added.

Julie, 40, who did not want to give her last name, held a sign that read “Wimbledon strawberries tainted with Palestinian blood, courtesy of Barclays”, along with plates of “blood-splattered” strawberries.

Zara Kamran, 23, joined in with the protesters’ chants before entering the court. “It’s nice. A lot of people think these protests are violent but you can see that they’re peaceful. People won’t be able to turn a blind eye. They’ll have to face the facts,” she said.

She said knowing Wimbledon was sponsored by Barclays would affect her enjoyment of the tournament. “I don’t want to be supporting a company like that,” she said. “It is easy to be ignorant. I think this allows people to be less ignorant. Now they can do some research and realise what these big companies are doing.”

Barclays is Europe’s biggest fossil fuel financier, having invested $235bn (£186bn) since 2016. A report by the Campaign Against Arms Trade claimed the bank held about £2bn in shares in eight companies that provide weapons, components and other military equipment to Israel.

In a statement posted online, Barclays addressed the criticism, saying it provided financial services to nine defence companies supplying Israel but did not “make investments for Barclays, and Barclays is not a ‘shareholder’ or ‘investor’”. It added that the bank traded in shares of listed companies “in response to client instruction or demand and that may result in us holding shares”.

On Friday, a Barclays spokesperson told the Guardian: “We are proud of our partnership with Wimbledon. Like many other banks, we provide financial services to companies supplying defence products to the UK, Nato and its allies. We are also financing an energy sector in transition, including providing $1tn of sustainable and transition finance by 2030 to build a cleaner and more secure energy system.”

A spokesperson for the All England Club said: “Our ambition to have a positive impact on the environment is a core part of putting on a successful championships. We know this is one of the defining challenges of our time and we are fully committed to playing our part. Barclays is an important partner of ours and we are working closely with them in a number of areas.”","“Wimbledon must stop providing cover for Barclays’ grotesque lack of morals and immediately end the sponsorship deal.”View image in fullscreen One of the billboards targeting Wimbledon’s links with Barclays.

The Guardian,https://www.theguardian.com/business/article/2024/jun/30/better-economic-news-will-not-stop-tories-from-suffering-their-biggest-ever-defeat,2024-06-30,10:14:41 UTC,Better economic news will not stop Tories from suffering their biggest ever defeat | Larry Elliott,"Down the years the Conservative party has taken some heavy election beatings but the one in prospect this week could be of a different order of magnitude.

Assuming the polls are right – and they have been consistent since the start of the campaign – the Tories will do worse even than in 1906, their previous nadir. Back then, the Conservatives and their Liberal Unionist allies won just 156 seats, a repeat of which on Thursday would now be considered a good result.

But in 1906, Arthur Balfour’s outgoing government secured more than 43% of the vote, while Rishi Sunak is polling at about half that level. And Balfour’s defeat could at least be attributed to a policy issue – free trade versus protectionism. Today, voters just seem sick of the Tories.

News on the economy since the election was called has had little or no impact on the polls. In part, that’s because the signals have been mixed: inflation fell back to its 2% target and growth in the first quarter of 2024 has been revised up, but the economy stagnated in April and unemployment has increased.

Living standards are certainly improving. The Resolution Foundation thinktank calculates that real per capita household disposable income – a guide to whether people are getting better off after inflation is taken into account – rose by 2.4% over the past year.

That’s the good news. The bad news is that over the 2019-24 parliament as a whole, living standards fell by 0.6% and one of the unwritten rules of political economy is that governments don’t remain popular when voters are getting poorer.

Only twice in the past century have living standards been lower at the end of a parliament than when it commenced: in 1918-22, when the UK suffered from a post-first world war boom-bust, and in the short parliament of 1950-51, when inflation rose sharply as a result of the rearmament programme for the Korean war.

In the inevitable postmortem examination that will follow the election, attention will focus on whether the Tories might have done better had Sunak delayed the election so that in time more voters would have come to think an economic corner genuinely had been turned. Another quarter or two of rising living standards would not have saved the Conservatives from defeat but it would probably have limited the scale of it.

As it is, Rachel Reeves will be the beneficiary. Analysts have been revising up their growth estimates for 2024 and 2025 on the basis that consumers will start to run down the precautionary savings they accumulated during the cost of living crisis.

Other recent developments – especially those overseas – are not so welcome. Joe Biden’s poor performance in his head to head debate with Donald Trump has made it more likely that the latter will win the US presidential election. Tariffs will be raised and taxes will be cut if that happens, threatening higher inflation and rising debt.

Meanwhile, the first round of voting in France’s parliamentary election looks set to show sizeable gains for Marine Le Pen’s rightwing National Rally party and a defeat for Emmanuel Macron’s centrist government.

Events in both the US and France highlight how things have changed in the near decade and a half since Labour was last in power.

Most obviously, the world has become a less safe place. The war between Ukraine and Russia is now well into its third year and has shattered the notion that permanent peace can be guaranteed for western developed nations. There are always demands for Labour governments to spend more on the NHS and on the welfare state. This time there will also be pressure to raise defence spending.

Globalisation has gone into retreat. Weak growth since the financial crisis of 2008-09 has seen a marked increase in protectionist measures – not just on goods but on people too. In Europe, North America and Australasia alike there have been demands for governments to restrict the number of foreign nationals entering the country.

What’s more, multilateral bodies are for the most part weaker than they were in 2010. The increasingly fractious relationship between the US and China means the G20 group of leading developed and developing nations cannot agree on much. The World Trade Organization is a much-diminished institution, unable to fulfil either of its core functions: to negotiate multilateral trade deals and be the final arbiter in trade disputes. The EU is having to contend with rising nationalist sentiment, a function of feeble economic performance and a reaction against rule by unelected technocrats.

The developing world has been even harder hit by Covid and the cost of living crisis than the rich west, increasing the incentive for migrants to look for a better life elsewhere. Yet aid budgets have been cut and promises to help poor countries cope with the impact of climate change have not been fulfilled. The world is getting hotter and the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank urgently need more money to meet demands for their assistance.

So those are the sort of challenges that Labour will face when it takes office later this week. Not the world of 1997, when Russia was seen as an ally rather than a strategic threat. Not the middle of the Great Moderation – the period between the fall of communism and the global financial crisis – when the west enjoyed year after year of growth and low inflation, but rather a world still trying to claw its way out of the Great Stagnation of the past 15 years.

And an angrier world where voters can quickly turn on their governments. Labour should enjoy its honeymoon period. It might not last long.","And Balfour’s defeat could at least be attributed to a policy issue – free trade versus protectionism.

The Guardian,https://www.theguardian.com/politics/article/2024/jun/29/transport-labour-tories-potholes-hs2-rail-road-pricing,2024-06-29,08:00:46 UTC,"From potholes to HS2, transport gets voters going – but some solutions are unsayable","Better railways, safer roads, cleaner fuels: in another decade, they would be the kind of transport issues commanding a pragmatic consensus in British politics.

But this election lands with transport wildly politicised, with clean air, speed limits and high-speed rail all dragged into the wider culture wars.

Meanwhile, transport has become emblematic of decline and the fraying public realm, from failing rail services to the potholes that pockmark Britain’s tarmac.

So what might the election resolve – and what are the transport policies deemed too difficult to sell?

The culture war battleground: drivers, Ulez and HS2

One of Keir Starmer’s less convincing recent repositionings may have been declaring Labour “the only party on the side of drivers” – a response to the long Conservative campaign to hammer home its backing for “people’s freedom to use their cars”.

The Tory plan for motorists was first outlined by the transport secretary, Mark Harper, in 2023 in a conference speech that appeared to echo online conspiracy theories about 15-minute cities, and signalled a clear move away from some of the urban planning measures the government had backed during Covid.

Now the party’s manifesto highlights its “backing drivers bill” in a chapter dedicated to “strengthening our communities”, pledging to curb low-traffic neighbourhoods (LTNs) and 20mph zones and reverse the expansion of London’s ultra-low emission zone (Ulez) – an unpopular move pinned firmly on Labour via the mayor, Sadiq Khan, despite the government’s own part in setting it up.

The rhetoric of ending a “war on motorists” is shared in Reform UK’s manifesto, which would scrap 20mph speed limits, LTNs and the Ulez, along with net zero commitments to transition from fossil fuel to electric vehicles.

Campaigners are concerned by the inflammatory language. Silviya Barrett, policy and research director of the Campaign for Better Transport (CBT), says: “We’re all more than just a driver, just a cyclist – we all need a range of means by which to move. Many drivers use buses and trains too, many walk their kids to school, and most drivers are keen to have more options.”

Another headline Conservative promise is to “stop road pricing”, implicitly accusing Labour of planning a pay-per-mile scheme. Starmer’s party has not backed any such policy, even though transport experts – including motoring organisations – believe some such scheme eventually must come.

Beyond roads, HS2 has perhaps been the only other transport issue as divisive. Scrapping the entire route, including that already half-built from London to Birmingham, is Reform’s headline transport policy, whose back-of-an-envelope calculations claim to save another £25bn.

Any mention of HS2 is conspicuously absent from Labour’s manifesto, while the Conservatives’ reiterates the derided “Network North” mixture of schemes funded by a putative £36bn saving from axing HS2’s northern leg. Only a lonely Liberal Democrat paragraph proposes finding a way to rekindle the high-speed railway to Manchester and beyond.

The post-election action areas: rail reform – and potholes

Despite the fate of the UK’s biggest engineering project, both big parties are pledging to speed up infrastructure delivery, with a Labour review under the ex-Siemens boss Jürgen Maier claiming both time and money could be saved.

But the humble pothole is perhaps focusing more minds: as Labour’s manifesto puts it, “the potholes cratering our roads are a visible sign of the decline after 14 years of Conservative rule”. The Tories have already earmarked £8bn to fill roads instead of building HS2. And even in a Labour manifesto where additional spending is all but forbidden, an extra £65m a year for potholes will be found by putting off a road-building scheme, the planned A27 bypass in West Sussex.

A bigger Labour pledge, but one that it argues is cost-free, is immediate rail reform, with the shadow transport secretary, Louise Haigh, promising “the biggest overhaul to our railways in a generation”.

Labour can afford to go large on reform plans that in many ways align with the Conservatives’ own belated attempts to force through change. Even what might once have been regarded as an ideological red line between the parties – partial renationalisation of rail – has been reluctantly enacted under the current government, as franchising collapsed and more train operators were taken into public hands.

Whoever wins, a new Great British Railways with a shake-up of the railway’s structure and fares is promised. The “guiding mind” will have plenty to work at: latest annual figures from the rail regulator, the Office of Rail and Road, show that only 85% of trains were officially on time (ie within five or 10 minutes of schedule) in 2023-24 – the worst performance in 19 years.

A critical task will be to end the disruption from rail’s long-running industrial relations standoff. While the Conservatives recommit to the ill-fated minimum service levels legislation, Labour makes no direct mention of the strikes, but a manifesto laced with references to working in partnership with unions to “end chaos” suggests a possible reset.

Off limits: road pricing and curbing flying

The vast majority of taxation from motoring comes from fuel duty paid via the petrol pump: about £27bn in annual Treasury revenue destined to dwindle and vanish as cars turn electric. For many transport experts, some form of road pricing appears inevitable and the fairest system. Politics, however, is likely to rule it out.

“Road pricing is toxic because it is very complicated,” says Steve Gooding, director of the RAC Foundation, who was once tasked as a civil servant with drawing up a plan that produced enormous public backlash. “People think – ‘I’m not driving in the rush hour because I like it, but because my employer wants me to turn up’.”

View image in fullscreen The Campaign for Better Transport advocates a charge of 2p a km for electric cars. Photograph: Ceri Breeze/Alamy

Barrett and the CBT have proposed a 2p per km charge for electric cars to make sure all drivers contribute to the exchequer. Gooding counsels that any scheme should be as simple as possible, citing the kind of pay-per-mile schemes being introduced in Iceland and New Zealand. He adds: “The dilemma is the government wants you to buy an electric car – but how do you do that if you charge people to drive it?”

But, he says: “I would be flabbergasted if someone in the Treasury building isn’t already doing that calculation. We all think this charge is coming. The sooner you are honest about it, the sooner people can factor it into their decisions.”

However, parties appear to be shying away from even the lip service paid to future net zero commitments. A Greenpeace/Friends of the Earth manifesto analysis scores the Conservatives on 1.5 out of 10 on transport, compared with 4.5 for Labour and 8.5 and 9 for the Lib Dems and Greens respectively.

Tackling aviation emissions is a harder, and could be even less electorally popular to fix than the transition for cars. The Lib Dems and Greens espouse some kind of frequent flyer levy, a ban on short domestic flights where a rail alternative exists, and increased taxation, on private jets in particular. Both main parties affirm support for the sector and its dubious solution of sustainable aviation fuels.","But this election lands with transport wildly politicised, with clean air, speed limits and high-speed rail all dragged into the wider culture wars.

Scrapping the entire route, including that already half-built from London to Birmingham, is Reform’s headline transport policy, whose back-of-an-envelope calculations claim to save another £25bn.","['transport', 'rail', 'voters', 'policy', 'solutions', 'labour', 'drivers', 'gets', 'scheme', 'electric', 'unsayable', 'roads', 'hs2', 'manifesto', 'potholes', 'going', 'parties']",https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/657a827cbe8cf4949a7fe8a2cf2d90303e5f6556/1094_1086_5284_3171/master/5284.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=a6cd55b972d0c53ca2403eabc790a3ee,False,better railway safer road cleaner fuel anoth decad would kind transport issu command pragmat consensus british polit elect land transport wild politicis clean air speed limit highspe rail drag wider cultur war meanwhil transport becom emblemat declin fray public realm fail rail servic pothol pockmark britain 's tarmac might elect resolv -

The Guardian,https://www.theguardian.com/business/article/2024/jun/29/will-rising-debt-cause-thames-water-to-sink-under-a-labour-government,2024-06-29,08:00:46 UTC,Will rising debt cause Thames Water to sink under a Labour government?,"If Labour triumphs in this week’s election, as polls suggest, then top of the incoming business secretary Jonathan Reynolds’s in-tray will be the possible collapse of Thames Water. The Thames timebomb is ticking – and could explode before new MPs have even become fully acquainted with the corridors of Westminster.

To recap, Britain’s biggest water company has been labouring under an £18bn debt mountain and has become the chief target of mounting anger from the public and politicians towards the industry over sewage spills, executive pay and shareholder payouts.

In March, Thames investors refused to stump up a pledged £500m of emergency funding amid a standoff with the industry regulator, Ofwat. So acute are concerns that the government has tasked officials with making contingency plans for a temporary renationalisation, codenamed Project Timber.

Its finances were back in the spotlight this week, when the Guardian revealed that a £150m dividend paid out from the regulated company on 27 March – hours before investors pulled the plug – was being examined by Ofwat. An internal party dossier by Labour’s chief of staff, Sue Gray, seen by the Financial Times, put the company’s potential collapse high on the party’s “risk register” after taking power, alongside prison overcrowding, bankrupt councils and an NHS funding shortfall.

One of the first tests will be the postponed publication of Ofwat’s proposals for the water industry on 11 July. The regulator had been due to release its draft “price review 24” – the process by which it determines how much each company can charge customers over the following five years – on 12 June, but the pivotal moment was delayed by Rishi Sunak’s soggy early election announcement.

Thames’s own five-year plan, submitted in October and updated in April, is at the heart of its standoff with shareholders, who fear Ofwat’s response to it will be too stringent. The company has promised an extra £1.1bn to tackle environmental issues on top of the £18.7bn already pledged, to be paid for in part by raising bills 59%, including inflation. The regulator has indicated it is reluctant to impose large increases on struggling households.

Investors will be combing Ofwat’s draft for an indication on the weighted average cost of capital it will allow companies, allowing them to calculate their returns. Last time round, some water firms successfully appealed Ofwat’s findings to the Competition and Markets Authority.

The documents will also be scrutinised to see whether the regulator will allow companies to build less than they promised, or the same projects at a cheaper cost, amid an industry pledge to spend £96bn on infrastructure, from new reservoirs to sewage treatment plants.

Thames, which serves about 16m households, is also due to publish its much anticipated annual results imminently. Sources said they were keen to examine whether the accounts, and those of the diverse collection of companies in Thames’s complex group structure, will be signed off on a going-concern basis, and whether they include a “material uncertainty” statement, as last year’s figures from parent company Kemble did. A source said the accounts were expected to be signed off at a board meeting on Friday and published by 15 July.

Investors hope the various publications could clarify the prospects for the group. Options still include a complex restructure, a debt-for-equity swap and a government-handled special administration – in effect a temporary renationalisation.

A source close to Kemble’s creditors said: “Obviously, the draft determinations are just a draft, but it will spark some activity.”

Colm Gibson, managing director at Berkeley Research, said: “Analysts and investors should be wary of reading too much into Ofwat’s draft determinations, as there is scope for Ofwat’s position to move materially before final determinations are revealed in December.”

He added: “Water companies have proposed large increases in their investment programmes just as they will face increased competition for staff and supply chain resources from the energy industry’s net zero programme, and a new government keen to invest in schools, hospitals, transport and other national … infrastructure. It will be interesting to see how this is taken into account in prices.”

This week, Reynolds said he “wouldn’t want to see a nationalisation” of Thames. “I think there should be a solution that involves [something] short of that,” he told an event in the City of London, without specifying what that solution might be.

Unfortunately for him, a testing financial squeeze at Thames may banish any post-victory party atmosphere before the balloons have even deflated.","If Labour triumphs in this week’s election, as polls suggest, then top of the incoming business secretary Jonathan Reynolds’s in-tray will be the possible collapse of Thames Water.

The Guardian,https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/article/2024/jun/30/labour-needs-billions-to-fund-its-plans-and-i-know-where-it-can-be-found,2024-06-30,08:00:16 UTC,Labour needs billions to fund its plans – and I know where it can be found | Will Hutton,"Since its foundation in 1900, the Labour party has had a Janus-headed attitude to capitalism. It needs capitalism to be successful, dynamic and job creating, even while it instinctively distrusts capitalism, with its capacity to generate extreme inequality, invest too little, cut corners and treat workers exploitatively. But its past efforts at improving things – nationalisation, top-down planning, championing strong trade unions or simply (as New Labour did) largely giving capitalism its head – have not been notably successful. It has been a standoff that the Conservative party has ruthlessly exploited.

The seismic importance of 4 July is that Conservatism’s approach to wealth generation – trying to shrink the state whose size and excess taxes supposedly “crowds out” suppressed investment and enterprise – is exposed as a dead end of stagnant living standards and eviscerated public services. Keir Starmer, boxed in by this dreadful legacy, has declared that Labour will become the party of growth and wealth generation. Only thus can sustained tax revenues be generated to repair the ravages of the past 14 years. My bet is that he has a better than even chance of pulling it off – and transforming Labour into Britain’s natural party of government.

His first advantage is that the economic evidence is unambiguous: the state does not “crowd out” investment, and low taxes do little to stimulate enterprise. What capitalism needs from the state is well-designed and stable policy that proactively manages the business cycle while “crowding in” innovation, infrastructure and abundant fit-for-purpose training, and shapes the savings system to deliver buoyant company share prices – the necessary if insufficient precondition for raising capital to enable higher investment and a startup and scale-up boom.

This is becoming the new common sense in business, finance and the financial markets. It is why investors are buying shares anticipating a Labour government, and why Dame Amanda Blanc, CEO of Aviva, suggested last week that there could be as much as £100bn from UK insurers ready to flow into business investment if chancellor Rachel Reeves can deliver her promises on stability. That alone would go some way to lift British public and private investment by £100bn every year – the scale of the gap between us and our major competitors – while not risking another Liz Truss-style fiasco.

One important avenue to growth, cited in the Labour manifesto, is the prospect of unleashing some of the £1.4tn funds fossilised in Britain’s 5,100 defined benefit pension fund schemes. Linked to a generous fraction of workers’ final year’s pay, they have become a financial burden. To wind them up, companies have closed them to new members, creating a £1.4tn universe of wholly risk-averse zombie funds. They need to be consolidated into bigger funds that can take risks – and the money made to work to accelerate Britain’s investment recovery.

There is the tool to hand. One of the most startling policy successes of the past 20 years has been New Labour’s Pension Protection Fund (PPF), established in 2005, which takes over the management of distressed defined benefit pension funds, guaranteeing the future pensions. Managed with great professionalism, the PPF has already consolidated more than 1,100 pension funds and is currently worth £33bn with a £12bn investment surplus – one of the most successful funds of its type globally in securing high investment performance. Industry insiders believe that there is another £600bn locked up in small, high-cost zombie funds that could be liberated for productive investment.

The first staging post would be to scale up the current PPF to at least £100bn. Conservative objections that this would leave the pension funds with no fiscal backstop can be easily overcome; backed by the state, the PPF will become the new backstop via a guarantee that does not score as public borrowing. Nor, because the PPF is so rich, would the state ever be at risk. Reeves will be on her way.

Britain would have an investment trio of financial institutions dedicated to multibillion-pound economic development

After all, such a guarantee is already delegated to the UK Infrastructure Bank (UKIB) to underwrite £10bn of commercial bank lending on infrastructure projects. Reeves should lift the facility to £50bn. A similar guarantee would enable the British Business Bank (BBB) to offer venture debt to startups and scale-ups, and seek out promising companies to back: there is an estimated annual shortage of up to £10bn of venture lending that needs to be closed. My understanding is that a scaled-up PPF would support both the UKIB and BBB; at a stroke, Britain would have equipped itself with an investment trio of financial institutions dedicated to serious multibillion-pound economic development and resultant growth – without additional direct government borrowing. It’s a fiscal get-out-of-jail-free card.

Against this background, Reeves can use her proposed rewriting of the fiscal rules to supplement public investment directly. The Financial Times recently reported that asset managers would buy an extra £20bn-£30bn of government debt if it were earmarked for investment projects and R&D. Altogether, the UK’s growth rate could accelerate to above 2.5% by the end of the parliament, with even the dropped £28bn target for green spending met. Growth would be higher again the more Britain regained access to lost EU markets.

In the near future, before growth kicks in, Starmer and Reeves may have to increase the current yields from capital gains, inheritance and council tax by up to another 1% of GDP. But overall there will be the funds to resuscitate education, the NHS, local government, defence, the criminal justice system, the arts and welfare. Do I dream? Some commitments are in the manifesto, others set out in Reeves’ Mais lecture in March, others have not been excluded during the election campaign, and the ambitious teams in the investment trio are all standing by for the call.

Some in the Treasury will oppose. And never underestimate the conservatism and parochialism of the pension fund world. Geopolitics may kill all hopes. But Britain under Labour could at last fulfil its economic promise and build a high-investment, inclusive, high-wage capitalism that treats its workers fairly. This time, no mistakes.","Since its foundation in 1900, the Labour party has had a Janus-headed attitude to capitalism.

The Guardian,https://www.theguardian.com/politics/article/2024/jul/01/housing-how-14-years-of-tory-rule-have-changed-britain-in-charts,2024-07-01,05:00:43 UTC,Housing: how 14 years of Tory rule have changed Britain – in charts,"Ask a millennial in the UK in 2024 what distinguishes them from their parents’ generation and it is likely that a single-word answer will crop up: housing.

Since 2010, despite a succession of government pledges to would-be homeowners, the average age of a first-time buyer in the UK has risen. Meanwhile rents have soared, homelessness has more than doubled and housebuilding targets have been repeatedly missed.

Here, as part of our wider series on how 14 years of Conservative party rule has changed Britain, we look at some of the key datasets around housing.

This article necessarily focuses on England because many housing matters are devolved to the Welsh, Scottish and Northern Irish governments.

Owning a home has become harder Owning a home “has got harder” under the Conservatives. That’s not a quote from a Labour party attack advert – but Rishi Sunak in a recent election interview with the BBC (he went on to say he would like to make it easier again). House price chart When David Cameron entered Downing Street two years after the 2008 house-price crash, the median house price in England stood at 6.9 times full-time employees’ median annual earnings: in 2023, it was 8.3 times. London in particular has become much more unaffordable since 2010: the median property price was 12.7 times the median Londoner’s earnings last September. It would be unfair to lay all of the blame for unaffordable housing at the door of the Tories – it has been two decades since a mid-range-price house in England was less than five times median household income (a different metric from the full-time-earnings ratio mentioned above) and prices rose much faster than income under New Labour. But – outside the 2008 housing bubble – the middle-earning household could still afford to buy a house in the cheapest 20% of the market. That changed in 2021 when official data confirmed that the middle classes were being squeezed yet further, with only the cheapest 10% of houses now affordable to the middle-earning household.

Renting a home is more expensive Both prime ministerial candidates have said they want a younger generation to experience the feeling of getting the keys to their first flat. But house prices aren’t the only blocker on home ownership because rents are increasingly eating into would-be-first-buyers’ ability to save for a deposit. Rental price chart The Office for National Statistics’ private rents index shows that renting in England is now 50% more expensive than 14 years ago, with the average rental price in London reaching a record level of £2,035 a month in February 2024. The cost of renting has increased across all the regions, but there are differences. While the rise in London and the south-west has gone above 50%, average prices in the north-east have gone up by 28%. This data covers all rents and not newly advertised properties, which means that for those newly renting or moving from one rented dwelling into another costs have probably risen by even more.

Not enough houses are being built Part of the reason for rising unaffordability – for buyers and renters – is a lack of supply. Housing target chart Successive governments have missed their building targets: David Cameron did not keep his promise of providing 200,000 new “starter homes” – aimed at first-time buyers under the age of 40 – in 2015. The National Audit Office said that, by the end of 2019, no such homes have been built. Theresa May made housing one of her main domestic priorities, most significantly in her 2018 party conference speech, when she announced measures designed to allow councils to borrow more to build up to an estimated 10,000 more homes a year; a welcomed, if modest target which, again, wasn’t met. Boris Johnson’s 2019 manifesto promised 300,000 new houses a year in England by the mid-2020s, although less than two years later, the then housing secretary Robert Jenrick admitted they would miss it by “a country mile” (the lastest figures show it’s 22% below target). And where local authorities once provided a sizeable amount of newbuilds – which made up close to 40% of new builds in the 1970s, the private sector is now dominant. It has built more than 80% of new housing stock since 2019 with just 1% coming from local authorities (the balance comes from housing associations).

“Affordable” rent has replaced social rent One of the early acts of the coalition government was the introduction of affordable rent – a new type of way to rent a property from a housing association with a monthly cost higher than social rent but lower than the market rate. It was introduced in 2011 as part of the government’s austerity measures to help housing associations raise money after a huge cut to their funding. It has turned out to be affordable in name only in many parts of England and has all but killed off building for social rent. Affordable homes Social rents are calculated taking into account local earnings and property values, while affordable rents can be up to 80% of the going rate in the private rented sector, and are typically set at that level. In 2022/23 the median weekly social rent hit £89, the equivalent figure for affordable rents was £134. That’s across England as a whole: in some parts of the country, affordable rents are double social rents, according to analysis by Inside Housing magazine. And since the new type of rented housing was launched, the number of homes being built for social rent has plummeted. While 39,562 homes for social rent were completed in 2022/23, the last year for which data is available, there were 9,561 new homes at that rent level, while 24,303 were created for the more expensive affordable rent.","Here, as part of our wider series on how 14 years of Conservative party rule has changed Britain, we look at some of the key datasets around housing.
Affordable homes Social rents are calculated taking into account local earnings and property values, while affordable rents can be up to 80% of the going rate in the private rented sector, and are typically set at that level.
In 2022/23 the median weekly social rent hit £89, the equivalent figure for affordable rents was £134.
That’s across England as a whole: in some parts of the country, affordable rents are double social rents, according to analysis by Inside Housing magazine.

The Guardian,https://www.theguardian.com/money/article/2024/jul/01/the-no-deposit-mortgage-that-lets-tenants-buy-the-home-they-live-in-with-a-gift-from-the-landlord,2024-07-01,09:00:11 UTC,The no-deposit mortgage that lets tenants buy the home they live in … with a gift from the landlord,"A growing number of people are taking out a little-known type of mortgage that allows them to buy a property without having to put down a deposit.

Several lenders offer “concessionary purchase” mortgages, meaning that a tenant can buy the property they are living in from their landlord at a marked-down price.

There has been a rise in take-up as tax changes on buy-to-lets and much higher mortgage costs prompt more landlords to sell. Now TSB, one of the lenders that offers these deals, reports significant demand.

“It’s gone from a product we never really spoke about to something that regularly comes up. We’re doing a steady number … there’s a demand for it,” says Roland McCormack, TSB’s mortgage distribution director.

For tenants given the chance to buy this way, it may be the best financial deal they are ever offered. And while it involves a landlord agreeing to take a lower price than they could potentially get on the open market, it also means a quicker, smoother sale – and no estate agent fees.

How do they work, and who can get them?

Quite a few banks and building societies offer mortgages that allow someone to buy a family member’s property for less than its market value – for example, when a parent wants to help their child on to the property ladder, so agrees to sell at a discounted price.

However, some lenders also accept mortgage applications from sitting tenants wanting to buy from their landlord, and from employees wanting to buy from their employer.

These are basically standard mortgages, but with one or two key differences.

Crucially, the seller typically has to agree to sell for at least 10% below its market value. Many landlords might find that hard to swallow. However, the seller will enjoy cost savings that, it is claimed, could offset about half of that loss.

In many, but not all, cases, the tenant does not need to put down a penny of their own cash as a deposit – in mortgage-speak, the landlord is giving the tenant “a gift of equity”, which is taken by the lender as a deposit. Assuming a 10% discount, the buyer would then take out a 90% loan-to-value (LTV) mortgage.

However, the buyer may wish to put in some of their own money to boost the deposit and bring down the LTV, which hopefully will give them access to a better rate.

The discount has to be a gift, not a loan, with no conditions attached.

These deals are something of a niche product but are clearly enjoying a bit of a moment.

Which banks or lenders offer these deals?

In addition to TSB, there’s the likes of Halifax, Nationwide, Barclays and NatWest.

Terms can vary. For example, TSB and Nationwide are among those that explicitly state they do not require the tenant to put down any deposit. However, both Barclays and NatWest say buyers need to contribute their own deposit on top – a minimum of 5%.

Typically, this is going to be an arrangement between a private landlord and tenant, though TSB and Halifax say the landlord can also be a local authority, indicating this could be an option for a council tenant where the right to buy is not available.

Why would a landlord agree to do this?

A combination of a less favourable tax regime for buy-to-let properties, and a string of mortgage-rate rises over the last two years, has led to many landlords baling out of the rented sector or evaluating their options. So there will definitely be some who are keen to sell.

By selling to their tenant, they avoid paying the costs normally associated with a house sale – notably estate agent fees, which can vary from less than 1% to as much as 3.5%. It also means they will not be paying perhaps several months of mortgage interest while the property is empty and on the market.

McCormack reckons those two savings will in effect cut the amount the landlord is giving away from 10% to more like 5%. “They are still out of pocket, but it’s a much smoother transaction for them,” he adds. “They don’t have to have a tenant move out of the property, do it all up and then wait several months – all while not receiving rent.”

On top of that, the landlord does not have to bother finding a buyer and dealing with lots of inquiries about the property.

One of the key benefits for a landlord would be the speed of a sale, “and, potentially, they don’t want to do a disservice to a tenant who has perhaps been living there for a long time”, says David Hollingworth of broker L&C Mortgages. If the landlord has made a decent amount from the property and has a good relationship with the tenant, they may like the idea of helping them become a homeowner.

Is this as good as it seems for the buyer?

Yes: they typically don’t need a deposit and are saving at least 10% on the market value.

Also, they know the property and the area, says McCormack. “They know the heating works, they know the neighbourhood, they know the glitches and they know the neighbours.”

A landlord’s £31,000 ‘gift’

First-time buyers Graham and Lisa received a huge financial helping hand to get on the housing ladder in the form of a £31,000 equity “gift” from their landlord to buy the home they had been living in for over three years.

They started renting the two-bedroom bungalow near Cheltenham in late 2019, and then, early last year, the landlord said he was looking to sell.

The couple, who had been thinking of trying to buy the property, spoke to a mortgage adviser who suggested a TSB concessionary purchase mortgage.

The couple made sure the terms were OK with the landlord – in particular, the 10% discount. He agreed, and they went ahead.

The house had a market value of £310,000. Once the £31,000 discount was applied, they required a £279,000 loan.

“We put in another £20K, so the deposit was £51,000,” says Graham, 32. That meant they were able to take out a mortgage (a five-year fix) for £259,000.

“This is probably the easiest way we could have got on the ladder,” says Graham, a production engineer working in aerospace. The couple did not need to move or compete with other buyers or “deal with any of the really difficult parts of housebuying”.

They are paying more monthly than they were when they were renting. “However, it’s into a mortgage, and the property is ours. Of course, we’ve got £30K of equity we did not pay for,” says Graham.","A growing number of people are taking out a little-known type of mortgage that allows them to buy a property without having to put down a deposit.

When they arrived, they found their view of the stage completely blocked by a tent and large items of technical equipment shrouded in black plastic.

They asked to be moved and were put in the very back corner next to fans who had paid a fraction of what I had.

AXS appears to be ignoring my email suggesting they sold tickets that were not as described.

ST, Gloucester

The premium package you purchased promised “unforgettable seats” along with branded merchandise. A restricted view was not mentioned, either, on the sales page or the confirmation. “Unforgettable”, at least, was an accurate description. Your daughters say they will never forget the disappointment.

AE of Faversham, Kent fears her Taylor Swift tickets in August will be similarly memorable, for she too has booked VIP seats, paying over £1,320 for two.

Feedback and photos from friends and social media suggest that she has also invested in a view of a large tent and bulky sound equipment.

“From the row we’ve been allocated, it looks as though we’ll just about be able to see the screen but nothing else,” she writes. “I’ve asked AXS for the VIP tickets we were sold – with a view of the stage – but have had no response and neither have friends who have already attended the concert and found they could see nothing.”

Other furious fans have reported on social media that their premium seats were barricaded behind stage equipment. The tent that blocks the view, ironically, is to lodge celebrity guests who probably get their tickets gratis.

Seats with a restricted view are supposed to be advertised as such, and priced accordingly. The venues are vast, and the stage viewed from the seated areas is always going to be in the far distance. But it’s an outrage fans have seemingly been misled into paying for a first-class experience when the stage configuration prevents them seeing it at all.

Neither AXS nor its sister ­company AEG Presents, the organiser of the tour, responded to my request for comment. They don’t need to. Performances are a sellout, with fans prepared to pay any money to get a seat.

ST’s next option is to make a claim for breach of contract and statutory rights via the small claims court, now Money Claim Online. The Consumer Rights Act states that purchases must be as described and fit for purpose, and ST can claim the difference between the price she paid, and the price of the seats her daughters ended up in. According to consumer lawyer Gary Rycroft, she can also try claiming for damages.

AE’s situation is less clear-cut, he says, since she has not yet attended the concert. “If the retailer offers a full refund, the logic is she will either have to agree, or not,” he says. “A cynical retailer may take a view that Swifty is in such demand they can easily sell on a refunded ticket at a similar price with full disclosure of the restricted view.”

On the night, you could demand to be moved, citing the Consumer Rights Act, and take photos of the blocked view to support any claim.

The Guardian,https://www.theguardian.com/money/article/2024/jun/29/unpaid-uk-carers-financial-hit-income-benefits-bills,2024-06-29,06:00:49 UTC,Unpaid UK carers ‘face financial hit that can last decades’,"People who look after family members free of charge are taking a huge hit to their finances which could continue into their retirement as they find themselves unable to balance paid work with their caring commitments.

Recent analysis of official figures by the financial firm Just Retirement found seven in 10 people who were receiving carer’s allowance were not in paid work, and missing out on earnings and private pension contributions.

Andresearch last year by the charity Carers UK found that 40% of those providing high levels of care for an ill, elderly or disabled relative or friend had left their employment, while 22% had reduced their working hours.

“Too often for unpaid carers in work, the immense stresses and challenges of the role with little support can mean having to reduce working hours or come out of the workplace altogether,” says Helen Walker, the chief executive of Carers UK. “This can have a significant impact on household finances, exacerbated by the current cost of living crisis.”

With just days to go until the election, the party that looks most likely to take power has said very little about what it would do to help the UK’s army of unpaid carers. The Labour manifesto does not include a single mention of the word “carer”. The Conservative manifesto does include a few brief mentions. Only the Liberal Democrats have put forward substantial proposals for better support.

Carer’s allowance is now worth £81.90 a week and is available to people who provide at least 35 hours a week of care to a disabled person.

Carers UK has been conducting an annual survey for several years, each time asking people about the impact of their role on their finances. Last year, it found 75% of those receiving carer’s allowance were struggling with cost-of-living pressures, with almost half cutting back on essentials including food and heating. The proportion saying that they were struggling to make ends meet had risen to 45%, from 39% in 2022.

The survey found that 72% were worried about the financial hit from expenses linked to caring, such as petrol for hospital visits, heating and specific dietary requirements.

Those who were employed worked in low-paid jobs as a result of the strict rules around carer’s allowance. An earnings limit means you do not qualify if you earn more than £151 a week – after that, you lose the entire benefit. The Guardian has revealed that carers who have inadvertently earned more have been taken to court by the Department for Work and Pensions.

Carers UK and Just Retirement say that these rules make it hard for people to stay in paid work.

“Removing unnecessary pressures and ensuring those who can, and want to, remain in paid work is essential,” Walker says.

She says the low level of the payments doesn’t recognise what carers do, “and there are clear problems in the way that it’s delivered, making even small amounts of work challenging. Raising the earnings limit is something that would help more carers to stay in paid work and help avoid some devastating overpayments.”

Stephen Lowe from Just Retirement says carer’s allowance was never intended to be a “wage” or payment for caring services. “However, if the rules are stopping or limiting people from taking up employment and earnings opportunities that are available to them, then we have to question whether it is fit for purpose.”

He warns that if people restrict their work or give it up entirely to provide care, “that loss of income and other work benefits such as employer pension contributions is likely to have an impact on their lives for decades to come, as well as on the businesses who lose key staff.”

Among proposals in the party manifestos for next week’s general election are a pledge by the Lib Dems to increase carer’s allowance by £20 a week and to introduce a new earnings taper of £183, after which carers would start to lose some of their allowance. Labour has previously said it would review the system but included no details in its election pledges.

Walker says that without better support for working carers, the problems they face will show no sign of abating.

“The last decade has seen a significant rise in the number of hours of unpaid care being provided and a reduction in social care available,” she says. “Our recent YouGov research revealed that 62% of UK adults – the equivalent of 10 million current or former unpaid carers – said they have had no choice about taking on an unpaid caring role.”","Carers UK has been conducting an annual survey for several years, each time asking people about the impact of their role on their finances.

The Guardian,https://www.theguardian.com/money/article/2024/jun/29/council-tax-final-year-students-warned-they-could-get-surprise-bills,2024-06-29,06:00:46 UTC,Council tax: final-year students warned they could get surprise bills,"Final-year university students have been urged to check that they do not owe council tax for the last few weeks of their rented accommodation.

While students are exempt from the tax during the course, they are liable to pay as soon as they finish their final year.

The UK government says student status ends the day after the close of a university’s summer term, usually at the beginning of June.

Student accommodation leases from private landlords typically run until late June, July or even August, and this discrepancy means the risk of a surprise bill.

Megan Lloyd, a debt expert at Citizens Advice, says: “Students become liable for council tax from the day after they formally stop being a student. This could be when their course officially ends, or the day after they abandon it or get dismissed from their studies.

“For example, if a student’s final term ends on 10 June, they will become liable for council tax from 11 June,” she says.

She adds: “This only applies to final-year students; students don’t have to pay council tax during the summer holidays between years of study.”

Manchester city council has already sent out letters billing graduating students for days since term ended. Other councils are less proactive.

A spokesperson for Council Tax Advisors said: “It’s advisable for students to check with their local council for precise details, as there can be variations in how councils handle the end of term exemptions and the start of council tax liability.”

Council tax bills are based on a property’s value so how much students could become liable for depends on the property they are renting.

According to Gov.uk, from 2024 to 2025, the average bill for a band D property (priced between £68,001 and £88,000 in value on 1 April 1991) will be £2,171 a year. This is about £181 a month – a lot when a third of students live off less than £50.

Students who receive a letter or due payment notice should take action so it does not result in a debt.

There can be serious consequences for council tax arrears, including legal action or a visit from a bailiff.

Students who can prove they are no longer living in the property may be able to get an exemption at their council’s discretion.

However, for the most part, those in this position will need to pay.

It is important for students to continue checking post, especially as their housemates begin to move out of their rented accommodation.","Final-year university students have been urged to check that they do not owe council tax for the last few weeks of their rented accommodation.
Megan Lloyd, a debt expert at Citizens Advice, says: “Students become liable for council tax from the day after they formally stop being a student.
“For example, if a student’s final term ends on 10 June, they will become liable for council tax from 11 June,” she says.
She adds: “This only applies to final-year students; students don’t have to pay council tax during the summer holidays between years of study.”Manchester city council has already sent out letters billing graduating students for days since term ended.

The Guardian,https://www.theguardian.com/money/article/2024/jun/28/savers-urged-to-open-inflation-beating-accounts-before-uk-interest-rates-fall,2024-06-28,07:00:15 UTC,Savers urged to open inflation-beating accounts before UK interest rates fall,"UK savers are being urged to lock into an inflation-beating savings account before interest rates start their downward journey.

A number of fixed-rate savings bonds currently pay 5%-plus – on these accounts your return is guaranteed and you will be earning more than twice the current rate of inflation.

However, with most analysts expecting the first Bank of England base rate cut in August or September, followed by several more over the next year or two, the rates available right now may not hang around for long, some commenters claim.

Mark Hicks, a savings expert at investment firm Hargreaves Lansdown, says: “This is a window of opportunity for savers, so now is the time to clamber in and grab a decent rate before it closes.”

Lucinda O’Brien, of the comparison website money.co.uk, has a similar message: “Now is the time to act, before it’s too late.”

Earlier this month it was announced that inflation measured by the consumer prices index (CPI) fell to 2% in May. It’s a far cry from the period in 2022 and 2023 when inflation was running at 10% to 11%, eating into the value of millions of people’s nest-eggs.

Many of the highest-paying savings accounts offering a rate of 5%-plus are fixed-rate deals where you have to tie your money up for 12 months.

At the time of writing, a number of players were offering one-year fixed-rate savings bonds paying 5.2% or more. These include the My Community Bank credit union and Union Bank of India (UK), both paying 5.22%; Vanquis Bank, offering 5.21%; and Close Brothers Savings, paying 5.2%.

These require a minimum deposit of £1,000, except Close Brothers Savings, which requires £10,000 to open an account.

However, Sarah Coles, the head of personal finance at Hargreaves Lansdown, says that while you can earn the most interest with a one-year fixed-rate account, “you would need to track down another fix when it matured [and] there’s a decent chance the rates on offer by then will be significantly lower”.

This is why two-year fixed savings bonds are looking attractive, she says. “You could consider tying up any cash you don’t need for two years, and making the most of the great rates while they’re around.”

On Thursday, the highest-paying two-year fixed-rate savings bonds were those offered by Vanquis Bank and Close Brothers Savings, paying 5.06% on minimum balances of £1,000 and £10,000 respectively.

Other providers offering two-year fixed savings accounts boasting best-buy rates included Hodge Bank (4.97%), Market Harborough building society (4.95%), and Atom Bank (4.9%). The minimum deposits for these are £1,000, £10,000 and £50 respectively.

“This is a really sensible time to consider locking in a fixed rate,” says Coles. She believes the Bank of England is not going to be in a hurry to cut rates, but they are likely to get progressively lower. “By the middle of next year [rates] are forecast to be 4.5%, and by the middle of 2026 they are expected to hit 4%.”

It is a good idea to review your savings rates anyway, if you have not done so during the past six to 12 months, says Rachel Springall, of the financial data provider Moneyfacts.

Loyalty “does not always pay”, and the average easy-access account interest rate paid across the biggest high street banks is 2.01%, which is 0.05% less than it was six months ago, based on a snapshot of rates on 19 June.","UK savers are being urged to lock into an inflation-beating savings account before interest rates start their downward journey.

The measure is part of a new code of practice that private car-park companies have promised to introduce in the autumn. Industry trade bodies will also implement a fairer appeals system and maintain an existing cap on charges of £100 – reduced to £60 if paid within 14 days.

However, motoring organisations have argued that the proposed code falls far short of the standards required and are calling for government legislation.

The AA’s head of roads policy, Jack Cousens, said: “This self-authored code doesn’t acknowledge the need to cap charges and remove debt recovery fees … These elements are desperately needed from a government-backed code to protect innocent drivers from the sharks running private car parks.”

The code was published by the British Parking Association and the International Parking Community, the two trade bodies representing private car-park operators.

It also includes requirements for more consistent signage and an “appeals charter” for drivers. The grace period means that vehicles in car parks will have 10 minutes after parking expires before being issued with a fine.

Parking companies will only be required to meet the new standards in full by December 2026.

Politicians and motorist groups have criticised private parking businesses – which issued 9.7m tickets between April and December last year – for unreasonable fees and misleading signage.

A bill to enable the introduction of a legislation-backed code of conduct received royal assent in March 2019. The legislation, which was withdrawn in 2022 after a legal challenge from private parking companies, included halving the cap on tickets for most parking offences to £50, among a number of other measures.

Simon Williams, the head of policy at the RAC, said: “Drivers shouldn’t be fooled into thinking this so-called code developed by the private parking industry itself is the same as the long-delayed official private parking code of practice that is backed by legislation.

“This, and only this, will bring an end to the worst practices of some private parking operators, and mean drivers – especially those who are vulnerable – are protected from unreasonable fines and debt collectors chasing down payments.”","Private car parks will offer motorists in the UK a 10-minute “grace period” before issuing fines, but motorists say the voluntary code is not enough to protect drivers from unfair practices.

The Guardian,https://www.theguardian.com/money/article/2024/jun/27/car-insurer-learner-driver-policy-collingwood,2024-06-27,06:00:30 UTC,Car insurer charged £40 to cancel learner driver policy,"I wanted to draw your, and your readers’, attention to something I think is extremely sharp practice by the insurance broker Collingwood.

I bought its annual learner driver policy for my son last year for £256.

Collingwood was clear that once he passed his driving test the policy would cease to be valid, which I understood.

In fact, it took my son almost the whole year before he passed, with only a few weeks of the policy left to run.

I was content to let it expire, in the knowledge that no partial refund would be due.

I was then very surprised to receive an email informing me that, since my son had passed his test, I now owed Collingwood a £40 “cancellation fee”.

I knew, in practice, no claim could now be made on it. I had paid the full premium upfront and owed nothing further.

Collingwood’s position is that the charge is included in its Ts and Cs, which I ticked when I bought the policy, and so is legitimate.

I see from different review websites that many people have been affected by this and are complaining they feel ripped off. I appreciate that cancellation fees may be appropriate when the consumer no longer wants the product, but charging £40 to basically allow a policy to lapse does not seem at all reasonable.

ML, by email

I couldn’t agree more. The company is, in effect, selling a policy that it expects the vast majority of its buyers will have to cancel before the end of the term, and is failing to explicitly mention this charge upfront.

It is likely doing so to make the policy look cheaper than it actually is in web comparisons. In my view, it is a hidden charge – one, as you say, that is catching out a lot of people.

I asked Collingwood about it and it says it was still looking into your complaint, made more than a month ago.

“The fee and conditions of cancellation are clearly presented in the customer journey prior to purchase, and also require an acknowledgment that they have been understood and accepted, before any policy can be purchased,” it said.

“With reference to the amount of the fee charged, this has been set with consideration to fair value and the consumer duty.”

If everyone who finds themselves on the wrong end of this £40 charge takes the matter to the Financial Ombudsman, the company will soon put it upfront on its website, which is what it should do anyway. Other potential Collingwood policy buyers take note of this shoddy behaviour.

The Guardian,https://www.theguardian.com/world/article/2024/jun/30/soaring-government-debt-could-roil-global-financial-markets-warns-bis-director,2024-06-30,18:57:59 UTC,"Soaring government debt could roil global financial markets, warns BIS head","Rising government debt levels could disturb global financial markets, the head of the body that advises central banks said on Sunday before France’s high-stakes parliamentary elections.

Agustín Carstens, the general manager of the Bank for International Settlements (BIS), said the world economy was on course for a “smooth landing” from the inflation crisis, but he warned that policymakers, especially politicians, needed to be careful.

Global government debt is already at record levels and elections ranging from the US presidential vote in November, to recent polls in Mexico and South Africa, and votes in France and Britain in the coming week, all carry risks.

Emmanuel Macron’s decision to call a snap election in France has sent the country’s bank stocks crashing and alarmed the bond markets, exacerbating fiscal sustainability concerns in the eurozone’s second-largest economy.

Polls released before the first round of voting on Sunday suggested the far right could win the largest share of the vote, amid record turnout.

Carstens said the BIS was not calling out any “one or two” governments but that the message was clear.

“They [governments] must cut short the rise in public debt and accept that interest rates may not return to the pre-pandemic ultra-low levels,” he said. “We need a solid foundation to build upon.”

With interest rates not about to go back to ultra-low levels, and cost pressures from ageing populations, climate breakdown and rebuilding defence capabilities, economic stimulus plans and a general rise in protectionism could unsettle sensitive markets, BIS warned as it published its annual report.

“They can surprise you with not much notice,” Carstens told reporters, pointing to the turbulence in Britain’s markets after then prime minister Liz Truss’s budget plans, which put some pension funds at risk of collapse. “You really want to avoid that.”

France’s main parties have all promised new spending. Macron’s government had promised to cut the budget deficit from 5.5% of gross domestic product last year to a European Union ceiling of 3% by 2027 – an objective that may be unattainable after the vote, which concludes with a second round on 7 July.

If it forms a government, Marine Le Pen’s National Rally (RN) wants to cut value-added tax (VAT) on energy, which it says would cost €7bn (£5.9bn) for the rest of this year and €12bn in a full year. The RN would also scrap a 2023 increase in the retirement age to 64 from 62, and says its spending plans would be paid for by cutting contributions to the EU budget.

The left-wing New Popular Front alliance, now polling second, says its first moves would include a 10% civil servant pay hike, providing free school lunches, supplies and transport while raising housing subsidies by 10%.

The turmoil has sent the cost to the French government of servicing its debt on the international markets rocketing, with the risk premium, or spread, demanded by holders of French debt over Germany’s rising to its highest level since 2012.

France’s blue-chip CAC 40 index is down 6% since Macron dissolved parliament, with French banks having been among the biggest losers. The big three – Société Générale, BNP Paribas and Crédit Agricole – are down 10%-14% since Macron’s announcement.

French banks have a large amount of debt and are expected to suffer if credit costs increase sharply.

The positive for Carstens was that central banks have successfully reined in inflation, which had hit decades-long highs after the Covid-19 pandemic, and then Russia’s 2022 invasion of Ukraine, which riled commodity markets.

“Compared to last year, I have to say we are in a much better place,” the former Mexican central bank governor said.

Although Carstens said central banks deserved praise for navigating a difficult path that could have resulted in a wave of recessions, he added that they needed to persevere, likening the inflation fight to a course of antibiotics to tackle an illness.

He described an “extreme” scenario where inflation raced up again and central banks needed to raise rates further. But that is not what the BIS expects.","Rising government debt levels could disturb global financial markets, the head of the body that advises central banks said on Sunday before France’s high-stakes parliamentary elections.

The Guardian,https://www.theguardian.com/business/article/2024/jun/30/unusual-economic-indicators,2024-06-30,11:00:20 UTC,What can lipstick and underwear sales tell us about the economy?,"Is the country heading towards a recession? Ask 10 economists and you’ll likely get 10 different answers. Which is why some people have given up on the traditional data – GDP, jobs, etc – and have instead recently been tinkering with more unusual economic indicators to help them guide their companies. Here are a few that I’ve seen.

Uniform patches

One known economic indicator is jobs and for that we tend to rely on unemployment numbers from the Bureau of Labor Statistics. But maybe there’s something better. Like the number of uniform patches sold each year. Uniform patches? Yes, those are the emblems that go on the uniforms worn by millions of workers, from fast food cashiers to drywall contractors. The financial data of one of the world’s largest makers of emblems and patches – privately held World Emblem – can’t be easily obtained. But the company’s owner recently told USA Today that sales are up 19% from the same period last year. A recession? “We’re not seeing it,” says Randy Carr, CEO of the Fort Lauderdale, Florida-based company. “It’s hard to believe there would be.”

Men’s underwear

Ask any guy about underwear, and they’ll usually admit the same thing. When times are good, we’re buying the good material. When money’s tight, we’re wearing those things until they literally fall off. So do men’s underwear sales mirror the economy overall? Some – including former Federal Reserve chief Alan Greenspan – think so. If you want to check out how the men’s underwear business is doing you can look at Hanesbrands or PVH Corp (which owns several leading brands, including Calvin Klein and Tommy Hilfiger) or Ralph Lauren Corporation. “Bottom” line: men’s underwear sales have been mostly flat over the past 12 months.

Lipstick

For the most part, lipstick is a relatively inexpensive accessory, with a typical tube costing anywhere from $5 to $20. History has shown that women will cut back on more expensive beauty goods like makeup and perfume when times are tight. But lipstick? Don’t even go there. When lipstick sales increase as luxury beauty item accessories decrease, that’s another potential sign of economic headwinds. Where to research lipstick sales? Try the big cosmetics companies like L’Oreal, Estee Lauder and Ulta Beauty. All three companies have shown strong revenue gains over the past year.

Overseas freight

World shipping has a significant impact on our economy and instead of tracking units and cargo activity, some economists instead track the price of freight. Why? Because in a supply and demand world, the greater the demand for shipping, the more freight should cost. To track this phenomena, look no further than the Baltic Dry Index. This is a well-watched measure of freight costs for shipping items across the Baltic Sea, one of the world’s busiest shipping lanes. So how are freight costs doing? They’re up more than 55% over the past year and even slightly higher than pre-Covid times.

Recreational vehicles

If you’ve never taken a trip in a recreational vehicle (RV), you’re missing out. It’s fun and a great way to explore our national parks. Some economists think that RV sales are an economic indicator because RVs – a luxury item - are not only expensive to buy, but they come with high maintenance costs and tend to calculate gas usage by gallons per mile. So how’s the RV industry doing? Judging by one of America’s largest makers of these vehicles – Winnebago – not so great. Sales have been declining for the past few years and the company’s stock price has fallen 35% in the past year.

I’m only scratching the surface on unusual economic indicators. Besides RVs you can follow the sales of champagne. Instead of men’s underwear you can also track women’s hemlines (which are believed to rise and fall along with the stock market). You can dig into the buttered popcorn index (which some say increases during times of recession as a small bit of a luxury in an otherwise cruel world). You can even keep track of hairstyles in Japan, where some say that women wear their hair longer when times are good and shorter when times are tough. Good luck finding this data, let alone making any sense of it.

Goofy economic metrics like these are fun to talk about with your friends and colleagues. But they shouldn’t be taken seriously. I run a business, and my go-to economic indicator is my clients. I’ve learned that the best way to insulate my business from the economy is to diversify: have as many clients in as many industries and geographic locations as possible. The US is a big country, and even when one client is cutting back on his underwear purchases in Illinois, I’ll likely have another buying uniform emblems in Texas. Focus on this instead of lipstick.","So do men’s underwear sales mirror the economy overall?

The Guardian,https://www.theguardian.com/business/article/2024/jun/30/the-baby-bust-how-britains-falling-birthrate-is-creating-alarm-in-the-economy,2024-06-30,10:00:21 UTC,The baby bust: how Britain’s falling birthrate is creating alarm in the economy,"Having children has become an unaffordable luxury for many of her generation, says Vanessa, a 35-year-old project manager living in Brighton.

“My friends who managed to start a family, without exception, all received large sums of money from their parents to get on the property ladder. For those of us not fortunate enough, we are trapped in the rental market, largely with insecure, poorly paid employment.”

Vanessa’s outlook is also clouded by concerns about the climate crisis, crumbling public services and the “plummeting mental health of young people”, she says. “Put these into the mix and you have a perfect storm for declining birthrates.”

Her decision is replicated worldwide. The number of women of child-bearing age is in long-term decline across Europe, parts of Asia, South America and the US, a situation made worse by the steep drop in the number of women, and their partners, who either want or are able to have children.

These factors have led to a sharp fall in fertility rates – the number of children born to each woman.

While the issues facing governments from rapidly ageing populations are relatively familiar, a decline in fertility rates that was once limited to Japan has spread across the world. Today, almost every continent has a growing age-dependency ratio as average birthrates fall and people live longer. If the global population hits 10.4 billion in the 2080s as predicted, it will only be because sub-Saharan Africa has continued on its current trend, pushing the population across the African continent from about 1.5 billion to as many as 2.5 billion.

Here we look at the trends, and the implications for future governments, of a demographic revolution.

How the UK is affected

The total fertility rate across England and Wales fell to 1.49 children per woman in 2022, from 1.55 in 2021, according to the Office for National Statistics (ONS).

As a benchmark, the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) says that to maintain a population, the “replacement rate”, often known as the “R-rate”, needs to be at least 2.1 children per woman.

It has been well documented that the pandemic, rather than spark a baby boom, had the reverse effect. Yet the recent drop in fertility has shocked demographers. The rate was already declining, starting in 2010: then came Covid-19, the Russian invasion of Ukraine and a deepening of the climate crisis, which all appeared to add a further downward shift, taking the fertility rate to the lowest since comparative data began being kept in the 1930s.

Ann Berrington, a professor of demography and social statistics at Southampton University, says: “The Human Fertility Database covering England and Wales documents the 1960s baby boom, 1970s baby bust, the fluctuations of the 1980s and 1990s that kept things fairly stable, increases through 2000s to 2010, and then a decline to the historical low levels seen today.”

The trend in Scotland follows the same pattern, but on a lower trajectory during each period over the last 60 years. Northern Ireland follows the same pattern on a slightly elevated path. ONS figures tracking live births tell the same story of decline. They show 605,479 in England and Wales in 2022, a 3.1% fall from 2021 and the lowest number since 2002.

This figure is not an all-time low because the UK’s population has been expanding since 2003, when the UK embraced the free movement of people from countries that had recently joined the EU. Opening its doors to workers from eastern Europe resulted in an increase in total births, and maintained fertility rates, which were about the same for UK-born and foreign-born women at the time.

But when record numbers of women are reaching the age of 30 child-free, the effect has clearly waned.

According to the latest data, half of women born in 1990 were childless by their 30th birthday – the first generation for which that is true.

It’s the economy …

When the Observer asked readers, including Vanessa, to say why they had not had children, or had restricted the size of their family, most replied that financial constraints were the main reason.

Hannah, a 35-year-old marketing executive living in London, says she had been unable to have the two children she wanted with her partner of 10 years, despite moving to a cheaper area to secure a bigger home.

Childcare costs were prohibitively high, along with other costs of living, she says. “The family we want to have is financially out of reach. We have only ever had one holiday together since our relationship began. We are cutting down on food bills and looking for extra work to make having a child happen.” She and her partner are considering moving abroad.

In the early 00s, Britain and France were outliers in Europe. Both countries had generous family benefits and governments with a stated aim of supporting children. The scale of generosity, from tax credits for low earners to an expansion of early years centres and childcare subsidies, meant both countries – under Labour in the UK and the Gaullist centre-right in France – arrested declines over previous decades.

In the UK and France, these subsidies were scaled back after the recessions of 2008-09. Austerity across all public services was the message from Nicolas Sarkozy, France’s president from 2007 to 2012, and from the UK ’s coalition government from 2010 to 2015.

For all the impact of welfare and public service cuts, a study by Fathom Consulting indicates those interested in creating a family look further ahead. In the aftermath of the financial crash of 2008, it was clear the future for many households looked bleak, with incomes flat and costs, especially housing, on a steady incline. Without the optimism of previous generations, couples decided not to have children, according to the initial findings from a study of Japan that links declines in fertility with periods when the future outlook for the economy was uncertain.

“It turns out that there is a good relationship between forecasts of 15-year forward growth in Japan at any point in time and the fertility rate in Japan at the same point in time,” says the report.

“In other words, people have kids when they feel optimistic that, when their kids join the workforce, the standard of living they will enjoy will be better than it is now.”

To measure growth, the report used national income per capita, which has improved in Japan while the overall economy has stagnated. Japan’s fertility rate is 1.3, just ahead of Italy’s 1.2 and South Korea’s 0.8.

The consultancy’s director, Erik Britton, says the research is ongoing and the conclusions only tentative, but the initial findings reveal that government support, while a necessary element, might not be the most important factor. A nation confidently growing its economy is the comfort people need before starting a family, he says.

… but also other factors

Recent data from the UK Generations and Gender Survey tells us that the ideal family size remains relatively high, with an average of about two children. There remains evidence of a two-child family ideal.

Berrington says that when her team asked childless people whether they intend to have children, there was “a lot of uncertainty in the answers”. Higher proportions of young adults said they probably or definitely would not have children, as compared with the proportions reported by millennials at a similar age.

Fiona Powley, 49, a life coach, knew she did not want children by the age of 12, and knows many contemporaries who also prefer to be child-free; she runs the group Bristol Childfree Women. As an indication of the problem faced by any government seeking to boost fertility, she says that when she asks people as they join her community what they enjoy most about being child-free, “they talk about time and freedom: finances don’t usually feature”.

She adds: “A common judgment from others asks ‘who will look after you when you’re old?’, to which most members might say they’ve made good financial provision for older-age care and pensions as they’ve not have the financial strain of children.”

Sarah Harper, a professor of gerontology at Oxford University, says one of the main issues is equality, meaning equal treatment by the state and within a relationship.

It is only when women believe they can continue working and have spare time that they will take the plunge into motherhood, she says – though the evidence from the Nordic countries, where fertility rates have followed the general downward trend, is weak. However, it might explain why traditional South Korea’s fertility rate is so low.

“These days women say they have no obligation to reproduce and ‘I’m not going to have a baby who turns my life upside down’,” says Harper, who advised the David Cameron’s government on the implications of an ageing society.

Public services

The Treasury’s independent forecaster, the Office for Budget Responsibility (OBR), says falling birthrates are going to have a negative effect on tax receipts. That is a situation that is not necessarily solved by higher immigration.

In a recent report, it said that while every additional migrant generally boosts the level of output in the economy, “the size of this impact and the effect on per-person living standards is highly uncertain.

“The age, education, skill level, and participation rate of migrants, alongside the investment response of businesses, are all factors that determine the impact of migration on per-person output,” it said.

At the moment, the UK population is increasing – by an estimated 6.6 million to 73.7 million over the next 15 years – but the economy is on course to grow at a slower pace, meaning there is less of the financial pie to go around.

Without a healthy rise in tax receipts, governments will struggle to pay for vital services.

Schools are in the frontline of cuts as pupil numbers decline, according to the Resolution Foundation. In England, they could lose up to £1bn in funding by 2030, with exceptional falls in pupil numbers prompting closures as some establishments cease to be financially viable. Councils across the country have begun to consult local residents about mergers and closures to make the system viable.

According to the Education Policy Institute (EPI), a thinktank, the north-east is projected to see the greatest decline in primary pupil numbers, down 13% by 2028-29.

Primary school teachers could face redundancy, such is the dramatic loss of young children, says Lindsey Macmillan, an education policy expert at University College London. She says secondary schools that are now suffering teacher shortages will see the gap close as classes are cut and schools merged.

Pupil numbers had grown because of a fertility surge in the 00s, but that cohort has moved through primary and on to secondaries, leaving empty seats in their wake.

Looking ahead, even with real terms increases in per-pupil funding over the remainder of the decade, the EPI predicts that many schools will suffer funding cuts due to fewer pupils causing income to fall, though costs will remain high.

What about ageing?

Plenty of questions arise over the fact that the birthrate is falling while medical improvements are helping older people live longer. Will robots be able to look after elderly people? Could a new social contract between young and old give millennials and gen Z the security and encouragement they need to have more children? And can the UK import all the missing labour it needs, such as from sub-Saharan Africa, where births are expected to be higher?

Nik Lomax, a professor of population geography at Leeds University, says one problem faced by the next government will be how different regions are affected.

“One way of thinking about the implications of this is to assess the old-age dependency ratio – the number of people of retirement age for every 1,000 people of working age,” he says. “This reveals striking differences by geography, and will get larger over time as the number of old people relative to working age people increases.”

Just as fertility rates are falling fastest in the north-east, Wales, the south-west and parts of the Midlands, the dependency ratio is increasing in these regions too.

Harper says a clear trend shows fewer people entering the workforce and older people living longer, and not necessarily in good health.

“Men in areas that rank in the lowest third by average incomes will live until they are 80, but spend their 70s in ill health,” she says. “Men who live in the top third of affluent areas will live until their late 80s and won’t be ill or have a disability, on average, until they are 80.”

Harper says the Cameron government put ageing into its industrial strategy and considered many of the implications of falling birthrates and rising levels of ill health among a growing number of over-65s. But the industrial strategy and policy initiatives were later jettisoned.

Given that we are not going to change the dynamics of fertility rates and have women go back to producing three to four children, we need to extend people’s lives in a healthy way, Harper says.

Berrington says the implications for policymaking are “very significant – for example, the short-term decline in demand for childcare, maternity services and other parts of the economy that depend on people buying goods and services for children. “Policy responses to low fertility have tended to focus on ways to increase fertility,” she says. “However, many pronatalist policies do not work, especially cash benefits, as they tend to just bring forward in time births that would happen anyway, and not increase the overall number of births.”

Pronatalist policies – those that attempt to boost the birthrate – are also often problematic in terms of entrenching gender inequality and reducing reproductive freedom.

A report by the Social Market Foundation thinktank in 2021 said the tens of billions of pounds it would take to support an expansion of family welfare could be better spent. “We do not recommend that the government pursues a distinct ‘population strategy’ to increase the birthrate. However, the government should convene a cross-departmental working group to examine how different policies affect the birthrate,” it said.

Berrington says healthy ageing is crucial to the prospects for the economy, providing more workers and helping fill the state’s coffers.

“And governments will need to look to other policy solutions, such as increasing employment among groups which for different reasons – poor mental wellbeing, or because they have young children – have relatively high inactivity rates.”","These factors have led to a sharp fall in fertility rates – the number of children born to each woman.

The Guardian,https://www.theguardian.com/business/article/2024/jun/30/if-workers-rights-are-a-bit-french-as-the-tories-suggest-then-vive-la-revolution,2024-06-30,06:00:14 UTC,"If workers’ rights are ‘a bit French’, as the Tories suggest, then vive la révolution | Heather Stewart","To the stirring strains of the Marseillaise, a monochrome Angela Rayner reels off her plans for workers’ rights, as a red beret and a Gallic moustache jiggle around her head. “Angela Rayner’s Britain?” demands the title, alongside a tiny tricolour.

Tory messaging has become ever more bizarre as this gaffe-strewn campaign lurches towards a close, but Thursday’s example, warning that Labour may make the UK’s labour market un peu French, hit new heights of weirdness.

For one thing, the mention of France seems more likely to evoke pleasant holidays than picket lines. More importantly, polling suggests the policies Rayner set out in the clip – employment rights from day one of a job, banning fire and rehire, binning bogus self-employment – are popular with the public.

Recent TUC polling found that two-thirds of people supported employees having the right to unfair dismissal from day one – including 61% of 2019 Tory voters. Similarly, two-thirds were in favour of a ban on fire and rehire.

Two things probably underlie the groundswell of opinion that tougher rules are needed in the labour market. One is the plain fact that too many people have found themselves working hard and still un­able to make ends meet. Real wage growth has been all but stagnant for the best part of 15 years, with average earnings a pathetic £16 a week higher than in 2010 – despite significant increases in the minimum wage (rebranded as the “national living wage”) under successive Conservative governments.

Against that backdrop, it is hardly surprising some feel the balance has tipped too far from workers to employers – a sentiment that perhaps also partly explains the ­support for public sector strikes last year.

It is more than that, however: there is a sense not just of a lack of bargaining power, but of unfairness, injustice even, in the way the labour market works for those trapped at the bottom.

From “self-employed” gig economy workers summarily laid off via an app to social care staff exploited by rogue employers and shift workers unable to plan childcare because of last-minute changes, there is an infuriating impotence about so many people’s interactions with the labour market. That is only likely to increase as new technologies are used to monitor and even manage workers as they go about their jobs.

In theory, Labour’s new deal for working people should help to turn the tide, particularly when combined with the tougher approach to enforcement Rayner has promised.

Social care is set to be the testing ground for a new approach of “fair pay agreements” under which employers and unions will have to hammer out terms and conditions that ministers will then apply across the sector.

Unions will be given the right to enter workplaces and make the case for membership – something the GMB has only just won at Amazon’s Coventry warehouse under strict conditions as part of a statutory ballot. And a new Labour government would consult about establishing a single employment status, abolishing the halfway house of “worker”, which comes with more obligations than rights.

As with so many areas of Labour’s agenda, however, the details will be critical – as will timing. Fair pay agreements were introduced in New Zealand in 2022, but implementation took so long that not a single one had come into force before the government changed and the plan was scrapped.

When, as seems likely, Rayner arrives at her desk as deputy prime minister on Friday, she will face intense pressure to water down the plans from business groups – and from some in her own party.

The Tory attack video ­echoed a line that originated with the CBI’s president, Rupert Soames, that Labour is poised to create a “European model” for the labour market. It is worth stressing how far away the UK is from that at present: Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development data suggests that 26% of workers here are covered by collective bargaining, for example, compared with 100% in Italy, 98% in France and 54% in Germany.

Regulation of the labour market has the potential to change millions of people’s lives for the better

But Soames’s concerns will find an echo among some in Labour. Furious unions confronted the party earlier this year over what they saw as an effort to undermine the new deal for workers – with union insiders claiming the shadow chancellor, Rachel Reeves, was keen to burnish her business credentials by being seen to push back against the plans. A fragile peace broke out after a face-to-face meeting between union general secretaries and shadow cabinet members, including Keir Starmer, but much about the fine details will only become clear the other side of the election.

The necessity to regain business backing has been a key part of Labour’s plan to win Thursday’s vote. If it succeeds, as polls suggest, the question facing the party on Friday will be a very different one: how to wield that power?

Regulation of the labour market is knotty, unglamorous and the subject of intense lobbying, but it has the potential to change millions of people’s lives for the better. Rayner should embrace the beret, face down the doubters and be bold.","Tory messaging has become ever more bizarre as this gaffe-strewn campaign lurches towards a close, but Thursday’s example, warning that Labour may make the UK’s labour market un peu French, hit new heights of weirdness.

The upward revision to Q1 GDP growth from 0.6% quarter-on-quarter to 0.7% q/q this morning (see opening post) suggests whoever is Prime Minister this time next week may benefit from the economic recovery being a bit stronger than expected.

So says Paul Dales, chief UK economist at Capital Economics.

He told clients that the economy may grow faster than expected this year – a boost to the winner of next Thursday’s general election.

The larger rise in GDP in Q1 was mainly due to upward revisions to consumer spending (from +0.2% q/q to +0.4% q/q) and the contribution from net trade (from +0.4ppts to +0.6ppts) more than offsetting downward revisions to government spending (from +0.3% q/q to 0.0% q/q) and residential investment (from +4.1% q/q to +3.2% q/q). The revision suggests that real GDP growth in 2024 as a whole may be more likely to come in a bit above our existing forecast of 1.0%.

Dales adds:

It now looks as though real household disposable income will grow by more than our forecast of 2.0% this year and we are expecting a solid 3.5% gain next year too. This underpins our forecast that consumer spending will be the main driver of a rise in GDP of at least 1.0% this year and about 1.5% next year. Should the saving rate fall back from its unusually high level, the economic recovery could be even stronger. This is certainly good news for whoever will be the Prime Minister this time next week, although it could also contribute to the Bank of England cutting interest rates a bit slower than otherwise.","So says Paul Dales, chief UK economist at Capital Economics.

Gross domestic product (GDP) rose by 0.7% in the first three months of 2024, revised upwards by the Office for National Statistics from a first estimate of 0.6%.

The first-quarter figures were lifted by growth in the services sector, up by 0.8%, as well as the production sector, which expanded by 0.6%, although that was revised down from 0.8% in the initial estimate. Other areas of the economy fared less well, with bad weather hampering the construction sector, where output fell by 0.6%.

The data confirmed that the UK was the fastest-growing economy in the G7 during the first quarter after a short recession in the second half of last year.

Real household disposable income – how much each home is left with after tax, adjusted for inflation – is estimated to have increased by 0.7% in the first quarter of this year, matching the growth in the final quarter of 2023, according to the ONS.

The strength of the economy has been a big issue in the general election campaign after voters suffered a squeeze from higher inflation and increased mortgage rates over the past three years.

Rishi Sunak has insisted that the UK economy has turned a corner but the latest encouraging data comes less than a week before polling day.

The Resolution Foundation thinktank said living standards – as measured by real household disposable income per head – were up by 2.4% as a result of pay rising faster than prices.

Despite the improvement as cost of living pressures have eased, living standards over the 2019-24 parliament as a whole fell by 0.6%, leaving the average person £120 a year worse off than they were at the time of the last election.

Adam Corlett, the thinktank’s principal economist, said it was only the third time since the first world war that living standards had been lower at the end of a parliament than at the start.

The UK economy showed no growth in April, with an increase in the services sector offset by falls in production and construction after heavy rain hampered building work and deterred shoppers from spending on the high street.

However, more recent figures show consumer confidence is returning – bolstered by falling inflation and stronger retail sales. UK inflation fell to 2% in May returning to the official target rate for the first time in nearly three years. Figures released last week showed retail sales bounced back with 2.9% growth in May after a weather-affected drop of 1.8% the previous month.

Economists said the improving economy was likely to benefit the incoming prime minister, with the Bank of England widely expected to cut interest rates later this year.

“It now looks as though real household disposable income will grow by more than our forecast of 2.0% this year and we are expecting a solid 3.5% gain next year too,” said Paul Dales, the chief UK economist at the research company Capital Economics.

“This is certainly good news for whoever will be the prime minister this time next week, although it could also contribute to the Bank of England cutting interest rates a bit slower than otherwise.”

Dales said the household savings ratio – the proportion of disposable income saved rather than spent – stood at 11.1% in the first quarter, its highest level since the second quarter of 2021.

Households tend to save more when they feel uncertain about the future, and the savings ratio rose during the cost of living crisis. Dales said that should the savings ratio come down from its “unusually high level” growth could be stronger than the 1% and 1.5% he was expecting for 2024 and 2025 respectively.","The UK economy grew at a faster rate than previously thought in the first quarter of 2024, handing the next prime minister an improved economic backdrop.

Unless the polls are wildly inaccurate, the Conservative party is heading towards a catastrophic defeat in the coming election.

All across the rich world, voters are angry at their governments – they blame politicians for a burst of inflation that happened almost everywhere and is now subsiding almost everywhere, including in the UK. But the Conservatives deserve defeat more than most: they took power 14 years ago promising to deliver responsible policies and economic success. Instead they have presided over economic stagnation and a collapse in public services.

Why has Conservative governance gone so badly? It is natural to blame Brexit, which did indeed increase trade frictions and therefore surely had a negative effect on British real income. However, Brexit has not had the disastrous effects some predicted, and has somewhat perversely led to a rise rather than a fall in immigration, especially of the highly skilled.

In fact, the roots of Britain’s poor economic performance are older and deeper than Brexit. Though many bad decisions undoubtedly contributed, one central cause was the way David Cameron and George Osborne gratuitously embraced fiscal austerity when they came to power after the global financial crisis.

At the time, this looked like an obvious macroeconomic error; more than a decade later, it has become a social and political catastrophe.

Let us recall the circumstances when the Conservatives took power. The financial crisis had produced a severe global recession; by 2010 the world economy was growing again, but all major economies, Britain included, were still operating far below capacity and had high unemployment.

Textbook economics tells us that when unemployment is high and inflation is low, governments should try to stimulate demand with reduced interest rates and fiscal deficits. Interest cuts were not an option because rates were already close to zero, so the indicated policy was fiscal stimulus.

Yet the Cameron government chose to do the opposite, pulling back fiscal support from an economy that still needed it badly. Britain was not the only nation turning to fiscal austerity in the face of high unemployment – Greece engaged in savage austerity, while Portugal, Spain, Italy and Ireland made large cuts, and fiscal policy in the US also turned contractionary.

What made the British case unique was that it was almost entirely an unforced error. Southern European austerity was a response to pressure from the bond markets: Greece was in effect cut off from private markets, while other nations faced sharply increased borrowing costs, becoming dependent on official lenders who insisted on budget cuts as a condition for loans. Bond buyers never lost faith in the US, but after 2010 Barack Obama faced a deeply hostile Congress, which in effect blackmailed him into spending cuts by threatening to provoke a government default.

While Britain had low borrowing costs like the US, its government was not divided. The Cameron executive could have chosen to maintain spending. Why did it turn to austerity?

Part of the answer is that policymakers were genuinely spooked by the sudden emergence of the crisis in Greece. Until Greece hit the wall, debt crises were generally thought of as a problem that happened only in poorer nations. It is understandable that many observers, at least initially, wondered if the Greek crisis was the leading edge of a broader attack by bond vigilantes.

But UK debt was clearly far smaller relative to the economy than Greece’s – and it became obvious early on that contagion from the Greek debt crisis was restricted to eurozone nations. So there was no reason to continue believing that the UK risked “becoming Greece”, as many politicians recklessly claimed at the time.

In fact, it soon became clear that even the eurozone crisis was more a matter of market panic than one of fundamentally unsustainable levels of debt. As the economist Paul De Grauwe has said, nations with debts in another country’s currency can suffer something similar to a bank run: panicked investors seeking to pull out their funds can cause a government to run out of cash, forcing it into default. Nations that borrow in their own currency are not vulnerable to such a self-fulfilling crisis, because they can in effect print money in a crunch.

This analysis was validated in 2012 when Mario Draghi, the president of the European Central Bank (ECB), said three words: “Whatever it takes.” This was taken to mean that the ECB would, if necessary, supply cash to governments facing a market panic. And suddenly the euro “debt” crisis faded away, with investors demanding much lower interest rates on the debt of Italy, Spain and so on.

Since Britain has not adopted the euro and had debts in its own currency, it was not vulnerable to this kind of cash crisis.

The bottom line is that there was no pressing economic need to slash spending in the face of high unemployment. I would argue that the best way to explain Britain’s austerity is not economic but sociological.

Sociology? I used to talk about the push for austerity being led by Very Serious People (a term I borrowed from the blogger Duncan Black). This was not really a joke: if you spend any time consorting with members of the global policy elite, you realise that many of them are driven primarily by the desire to appear “serious”. In economic terms, this usually means pushing policies that will cause significant hardship – to other people, of course.

The obsession with perceived seriousness reflects peer pressure, but in some ways also reflects personal careerism. Officials in democratic nations cannot expect to remain in office for more than a few years. What do they do next? If they have lobbied for “serious” policies, they can have a bright future giving speeches at Davos about the importance of making “tough choices”. Or they might even end up employed by the financial industry to lobby their former colleagues – where a reputation for “seriousness” is a prerequisite, no matter how much damage those policies have caused. (Indeed, Osborne has done both.)

Sociology partly explains the Conservative embrace of austerity. But there was also political calculation. Denunciations of debt and deficits often go hand in hand with demands for smaller government, in particular a shrunken welfare state. In effect, politicians whose real goal is to move policy to the right exploit fear of deficits to push an agenda that would be deeply unpopular if stated openly. The Oxford economist Simon Wren-Lewis calls this the “deficit deceit” hypothesis. The deceit aspect is especially obvious in the US, where Republican leaders routinely denounce deficits while pushing for budget-busting tax cuts. But there is every reason to believe that the same kind of cynicism played an important role in UK austerity.

It turns out, however, that exploiting debt fears to engineer cuts in public spending tends not to work out quite the way that small-government advocates hope.

What serious conservatives – they do exist – want is a less generous social safety net, with fewer income transfers to households, while governments concentrate on those functions that only government can perform. I do not share that desire, but never mind. What is important is that voters do not share that desire: cutting direct financial aid is deeply unpopular.

What does this have to do with deficit deceit? Even when a government manages to build support for spending cuts by scaring the public about debt and deficits, it generally finds itself shying away from spending cuts that will directly affect families’ incomes. Instead, it tries to save money by shortchanging public investment and public services, a strategy that seems preferable because the consequences of these spending cuts may not be all that visible in the short run.

But the effects of inadequate public investment cumulate over time, so that a fiscal strategy advertised as an exercise in responsibility ends up being deeply irresponsible, leading to crumbling infrastructure and deteriorating public services. This is how Cameron and Osborne’s error has compounded over the past decade.

Consider the NHS. I am clearly not an expert on the system, and I am sure that the NHS’s problems have multiple causes. But it is obvious to an outsider that direct public provision of healthcare, while it has major advantages, creates a special form of political vulnerability.

Compare the NHS with single-payer systems – including Medicare, which serves older Americans – in which the government pays the bills but does not employ the doctors or operate the hospitals. An attempt to save money by underfunding Medicare would provoke an immediate public outcry – in fact, false rumours of such a move created an outcry in 2010. But a government can underfund the NHS for years before the consequences become obvious to voters, and by that time the crisis can be very hard to fix.

To sum up: a decade ago, the main critique of austerity was macroeconomic – it was holding back recovery from the severe recession that followed the global financial crisis. And it did. But that was not the end of the story. Austerity also gradually undermined public services, including healthcare.

What will a Labour government do to reverse this damage? There are two reasons to worry it will fall short.

First, the era of Conservative austerity coincided with an era of low interest rates and substantial excess capacity, exactly the conditions under which Britain should have been investing in its future. The current environment is much less favourable.

Second, Labour’s stated plans lack any ambition to reverse austerity. In the US, the Biden administration came in with bold plans and managed to accomplish a significant fraction of them despite having only a razor-thin congressional majority. I am not hearing anything comparable from Labour, even though Keir Starmer seems on course to have political capital beyond the wildest dreams of US progressives.

I hope to be proved wrong. But right now it looks as though the shadow of austerity policies adopted in error 14 years ago will continue to darken Britain’s prospects for many years to come.","Though many bad decisions undoubtedly contributed, one central cause was the way David Cameron and George Osborne gratuitously embraced fiscal austerity when they came to power after the global financial crisis.
Britain was not the only nation turning to fiscal austerity in the face of high unemployment – Greece engaged in savage austerity, while Portugal, Spain, Italy and Ireland made large cuts, and fiscal policy in the US also turned contractionary.
What made the British case unique was that it was almost entirely an unforced error.
And suddenly the euro “debt” crisis faded away, with investors demanding much lower interest rates on the debt of Italy, Spain and so on.

The Guardian,https://www.theguardian.com/politics/article/2024/jun/27/labour-europe-eu-brexit-jonathan-reynolds,2024-06-27,16:47:34 UTC,Labour to seek ‘stable position’ with Europe rather than reopen Brexit debate,"Labour would rather have stability in the UK’s relationship with Europe than try to seek accelerated economic growth by rejoining the EU’s single market or customs union, the shadow business secretary has said.

Addressing the British Chambers of Commerce (BCC) conference on Thursday, Jonathan Reynolds acknowledged that Brexit had been “very difficult for businesses” because it had erected trade barriers, but said reopening the debate would be worse.

With less than a week to go until polls open in the general election, Reynolds was trying to woo business leaders at the London event with a pitch that emphasised policy stability and encouraged businesses to invest.

Some business leaders and economists have said Labour’s hopes to grow the economy – and thereby pay for improved public services – could flounder without improved access to EU trade. But Reynolds argued that returning to the tumultuous debate over Brexit would be economically harmful because businesses would hold back investments further.

“You could not relive the argument and provide people with the assurance they need that we are moving to a period where British politics is going to be in a stable position rather than frankly causing you more difficulties,” he said.

“The practical, trade-based agreements that we put forward, rather than the constitutional arguments around customs unions or single markets, are a genuinely better way to do that.”

Kemi Badenoch, Reynolds’s Conservative counterpart, appeared later at the same event. She portrayed a Labour government as a threat to the sector and said her party believed in the “power of business to do good”.

However, the business secretary focused much of her appearance on “my favourite topic, of course, the divisive topic of identity politics”.

Badenoch compared Labour plans to monitor ethnic pay disparities to apartheid South Africa, saying she thought that the policy – an idea previously proposed by the Tory prime minister Theresa May – was “morally repellent” and claimed Labour wanted ethnicity to influence pay.

Labour’s manifesto does not say ethnicity should influence pay. The party has pledged to “enshrine in law the full right to equal pay for Black, Asian and other ethnic minority people” as well as make larger companies report the gap between pay for disabled and ethnic minority employees and the broader workforce. The Conservative party introduced similar gender pay gap reporting in 2017.

Shevaun Haviland, the BCC’s director general, told the conference that the political parties must stop “walking on eggshells” and try to improve the UK’s relationship with Europe, notably on aligning food and drink regulations, VAT and mutual recognition of professional qualifications. However, she added that Reynolds was right that “businesses don’t want a renegotiation”.

Amanda Blanc, the chief executive of the FTSE 100 insurer Aviva, told the conference that “an air of weariness and cynicism hangs over our economy” and that some of the “doom and gloom” was justified. However, she said she was optimistic that stable public policy after the election would allow businesses to invest in growing the economy.

Labour’s emollient message to business contrasts with 2019, when it lost the last election under the leadership of Jeremy Corbyn. Reynolds said the party’s relationship with business was “one of the most visible ways that Labour has changed since 2019”.

He was challenged at the conference by the owners of one business who said they were concerned about Labour’s pledge to give workers stronger rights, such as statutory sick pay and parental leave, from their first day of employment rather than after two years.

Fintan and Alison Galvin, a couple who serve as the chief executive and chief people officer of the Surrey-based software company Inv Group, said they were concerned that the changes would make it riskier for them to hire and train new workers.

“It seems very anti-business,” Alison Galvin said. “All of a sudden to have this potential curveball … You’ve got your probation period, but then after that what does that all look like?”

Fintan Galvin said: “To grow a business you’ve got to take risks. Anything that enhances a risk profile of employing a person is bad.”

Reynolds said he did not believe that Labour’s changes would affect the company’s recruitment practices, and he invited them to meet him to discuss their concerns.

During the election campaign Labour has also avoided making surprise policy announcements, mostly sticking with longstanding policy. Reynolds defended the party against accusations of running a boring campaign.

“I’m told by some commentators they don’t think Labour’s campaign is exciting enough,” he said. “Look, my friends, we’re not pitching you a new Netflix series, you know, we’re not putting on politics as entertainment.”","But Reynolds argued that returning to the tumultuous debate over Brexit would be economically harmful because businesses would hold back investments further.

Newsflash: The Bank of England has warned that financial markets remain at risk of a sharp correction.

In its latest financial stability report, the BoE says that high inflation, or geopolitical risks, could trigger a selloff.

The Bank says risks to the UK financial system are “broadly unchanged” since the first quarter of the year.

But some asset prices have continued to rise, it points out, while the risk of a sharp correction persists.

European markets are up around 8% so far this year, while the US Nasdaq Composite index has surged by 18%.

The report, which is designed to track the stability of the financial system, says:

The prices of many assets such as shares and bonds remain high relative to historical norms, and some have continued to rise. This suggests that investors in financial markets are continuing to expect the economy to recover and inflation to fall. They are placing less weight on risks, such as geopolitical developments or continued high inflation, that might cause weaker growth or interest rates to stay higher than expected. These risks make it more likely that there could be a sharp correction in asset prices that could ultimately make it more costly and difficult for UK households and businesses to borrow.

The Guardian,https://www.theguardian.com/business/article/2024/jun/27/global-elections-uk-economy-bank-of-england,2024-06-27,11:33:58 UTC,"Global wave of elections could hit UK financial system, warns Bank of England","Uncertainty caused by a global wave of elections, starting this weekend in France, risks destabilising the UK’s financial system, the Bank of England has warned.

Officials are concerned about the kind of policies that newly elected governments may enforce in large economies, including the US, where Donald Trump is vying for another term as president in the run-up to the election in November.

The French president Emmanuel Macron’s shock announcement of a parliamentary election, with a first round of voting on 30 June and Marine Le Pen’s far-right National Rally party forecast to make significant gains, had shown how political uncertainty could impact economic growth forecasts and cause volatility in financial markets, affecting government debt prices, the Bank’s financial policy committee (FPC) said.

But it is the sheer number of elections taking place this year that was cause for concern, with more than 80 countries – more than half the world’s population –heading to the polls this year. That includes the UK, where citizens will vote in a general election on 4 July.

“Policy uncertainty associated with upcoming elections globally has increased,” the Bank’s financial stability report said. Questions over a country’s political direction could amplify geopolitical risks, increase government borrowing costs, and lead to further global fragmentation, in a way that was “relevant to UK financial stability”, it said.

The FPC said it was still monitoring the impact high interest rates were having on households and businesses in the UK, with the Bank’s monetary policy committee having held rates at 5.25% this month for the seventh consecutive time.

That includes the 400,000 households whose monthly mortgage payments are expected to soar by 50% as they roll off fixed rates between now and the end of 2026.

In total, about 3 million – or 35% – of mortgageholders are still on fixed rates of below 3% and are due to see their payments jump over the next two years.

However, if headline interest rates drop from August onwards, as markets predict, another 2 million mortgageholders – including those on variable rates or coming off mortgages set at a higher level – could benefit, offsetting refinancing pressure for some households.

There are also concerns about the financial system’s exposures to the $8tn private-equity industry, which boomed during a period of low interests rates and has grown to play a significant role in financing UK businesses.

“Although the sector has been resilient so far, it is facing challenges in the higher rate environment,” the FPC said, noting this was becoming apparent as firms were forced to refinance their debt at much higher prices.

The FPC said it had also found “gaps” in the way UK banks were managing their exposure to the private-equity industry. The Bank of England and Financial Conduct Authority said they were working together to address a lack of transparency in overall borrowing levels, as well as the valuation of private-equity firms and their investments.

Policymakers said they would continue to test the resilience of the UK’s banking sector, revealing they would be testing the industry against the possibility of two separate and “severe” economic shocks.

The first – a “supply-shock scenario” echoing the ripple effects of Russia’s invasion of Ukraine – would cause inflation and interest rates to soar to 12% and 9%, respectively, as geopolitical tensions disrupt supply chains and cause the price of global commodities to soar.

The second “demand-shock scenario” – which has similarities to the impact of Covid-era lockdowns – assumes demand for global goods and services in decline, sending inflation and interest rates below 0.5% for a prolonged period of time.

In both cases, unemployment is projected to peak at 8.5% and the property industry would take a big hit, with commercial real estate prices declining by nearly 50%.

This year’s so-called desk-based stress tests are the second to be conducted without input from individual banks since they were launched a decade ago in response to the 2008 financial crisis. The Bank of England will not release bank-by-bank results but will issue an aggregate report by the end of the year.","Uncertainty caused by a global wave of elections, starting this weekend in France, risks destabilising the UK’s financial system, the Bank of England has warned.

The Guardian,https://www.theguardian.com/business/article/2024/jun/27/labours-growth-strategy-the-devil-lies-not-in-planning-but-in-implementation,2024-06-27,07:34:41 UTC,"Labour’s growth strategy: the devil lies not in planning, but in implementation","As in many other developed countries lately, the two major political parties in the UK have embraced economic growth as their top policy priority. After the volatile 49-day experience of Liz Truss’s government and its “dash for growth” in 2022, however, both parties emphasise that there are no financial shortcuts. The focus, instead, is on devising measures to boost productivity, resource allocation, and growth over the long term. In this respect, the opposition Labour party is ahead of the ruling Conservatives, though both are still working out the details of actual implementation.

Buoyant, durable, sustainable and inclusive growth is essential for a country where the older generations risk seeing their children end up worse off than they are. That has not happened in many decades. Only growth can deliver the resources needed to enhance living standards, improve public services, support sustainable energy initiatives, limit the scale of generalised tax increases, and combat inequality of wealth, income and opportunity.

In short, it is all about increasing the safe speed limit for economic growth. The Bank of England estimates the UK economy’s potential growth may be as low as 1%. At that speed, much that ails the country is likely to get worse, rather than better, over time. Moreover, this already weak growth potential could deteriorate even further if the problem is left to fester.

There is no singular, silver-bullet initiative that can change this outlook. Many British politicians are still haunted by the Truss saga, when the newly arrived prime minister tried to use unfunded tax cuts as a stimulus, only to create a damaging episode of financial instability. It is now widely acknowledged that after so many years of insufficient investment and sagging productivity, achieving high-quality growth requires a comprehensive policy approach that builds on many intermediate objectives.

The Labour party has gone further in specifying such structural reforms. Its programme includes proposals to revamp the planning system, boost infrastructure, improve trade links, crowd in domestic and foreign private investment (including through an energised National Wealth Fund), remove tax distortions, and pursue sector-specific initiatives. The party has also identified promising public-private partnerships geared toward enhancing investible funds, while encouraging innovation and efficiency.

Labour has indicated it would try to “hardwire” many of these reforms by strengthening existing institutions. To ensure all its policies remain compatible with financial stability, it has committed to adhere to the same public-debt “rule” as the current Conservative party.

The challenge now is to devise a detailed execution plan, one that includes a high-frequency monitoring system to provide real-time feedback and allow for timely course corrections, if needed. Any economic policy roadmap must favour comprehensive over piecemeal reforms. Such reforms should be implemented simultaneously, rather than sequentially, and they should come sooner rather than later.

As Labour demonstrated with its successful takeoff after coming to power in 1997, a new growth emphasis would benefit from serious credibility-enhancing steps. That is what then-chancellor of the exchequer Gordon Brown did with his surprising and insightful decision to hand over the reins of interest rate policy to the Bank of England, thus enshrining the principle of central bank independence.

One must hope that the current Labour leadership has not ruled out too much policy flexibility in its pursuit of a decisive election victory. Some of the most powerful measures that it is proposing would require resources upfront, but their growth and financial benefits would materialise only over time. The next government will also find itself confronting a more complicated, increasingly fragmented international system, and it will need to secure consistent buy-in from the private sector, which ultimately must do most of the heavy lifting.

Another, related task is to improve the functioning of existing growth engines while also supporting the development of the sectors and industries that will drive growth in the future. Striking a proper balance may prove to be the most difficult part of the challenge, given the country’s resource constraints and the fact that some key initiatives are better pursued at a regional level. (With its lack of sufficient robust regional initiatives to drive innovation in artificial intelligence, life sciences, and sustainable energy, the European Union faces a similar problem.)

Promoting high, durable, sustainable and inclusive growth was never going to be easy after so many years of neglect. The need to revamp the UK’s existing growth engines and simultaneously kickstart new ones makes the task even more complicated. But to paraphrase the US president John F Kennedy’s famous moonshot speech, the winning party must do these and “other things, not because they are easy, but because they are hard”.

The Guardian,https://www.theguardian.com/politics/article/2024/jun/26/uk-post-brexit-deal-bcc-eu,2024-06-26,21:30:20 UTC,"UK must stop ‘walking on eggshells’ over post-Brexit deal, says BCC chief","The UK’s current trade deal with the EU is not working and the country must stop “walking on eggshells” around the issue of building closer ties with its biggest trading partner, the director general of the British Chambers of Commerce (BCC) is expected to say.

At the annual BCC global conference in London on Thursday, Shevaun Haviland will say that the UK must forge closer ties with the EU and the next government should focus on improving trading relations to grow the economy.

“We must stop walking on eggshells and start saying it how it is,” Haviland will say.

“The current plan isn’t working for our members. But better trade terms are possible if the UK government and the EU reach agreement in areas of mutual benefit for business on both sides. A better deal is best for everyone.”

The intervention comes amid an election campaign where the two main political parties have largely stayed clear of the Brexit debate. Labour and the Conservatives have been criticised for their reluctance to discuss how successful Brexit has been and future policies towards the EU.

In an interview earlier this month, Keir Starmer had to deny that he was scared of talking about the issue, instead saying he was determined to build a “closer, better” relationship with the EU and improve Boris Johnson’s “botched deal”.

Businesses have criticised the additional red tape and increased costs that Brexit has heaped on to firms importing and exporting goods to and from the continent.

Importers of food and plants have been hit by charges associated with new Brexit border checks brought in at the end of April, with some logistics companies saying the changes have added up to 60% to transport costs.

Other businesses have complained that the increasing divergence on standards, such as those around construction products, has made it more expensive for UK companies to get their products certified for sale on the continent.

The comments from Haviland come as the BCC makes improving relations with the EU one of its key requests for the next government, saying the step would reduce costs for businesses.

The trade body is made up of 53 regional chambers of commerce affiliated to a central body and says it represents 50,000 businesses in the UK, which collectively employ six million people.

Its requests cover several specific policies, including securing a supplementary deal with the EU to remove the complexity of exporting food for small and medium-sized enterprises, and ensuring there are no new trade barriers created by linking the UK and EU emissions trading schemes.

It is also lobbying for a new deal that would allow UK companies to travel and work in Europe for longer.

The Labour party has said it will not return to the single market, the customs union or freedom of movement, but wants to deepen ties with Europe.

This includes negotiating a veterinary agreement to prevent border checks, help touring artists secure visas, while also promising to an agreement on professional qualifications to help open up markets for UK service exporters.

The Conservative manifesto says that the party would aim to build on the UK’s trade and cooperation agreement with the EU, but would not agree to anything that would “infringe the country’s sovereignty or involve submission to the court of justice of the European Union”.

It also said it wanted to further the benefits of Brexit by signing more trade deals, speeding up infrastructure developments, cutting red tape for business and creating new fishing opportunities.

Haviland will also use her speech to call for a long-term economic growth plan with a vision of up to 20 yearsand warn that action is needed to fix the UK’s growing skills shortages.","The UK’s current trade deal with the EU is not working and the country must stop “walking on eggshells” around the issue of building closer ties with its biggest trading partner, the director general of the British Chambers of Commerce (BCC) is expected to say.

5d ago 15.08 CEST Looking at the European economy, S&P Global says activity in the eurozone is on the rise, with the May composite purchasing managers’ indices firmly above the expansion threshold. Today’s report says: The eurozone has exited the recent manufacturing recession, putting it cyclically ahead of the U.S. Meanwhile, the labor market continues to slow although the unemployment rate remains near all-time lows. Southern Europe (Spain and Italy) continues to outperform Northern Europe (Germany) not only due to a prevalence of services, but also a rise in productivity in the case of Spain. Recent slower growth at the eurozone level reflects in part a faster passthrough of monetary policy, which has led to weaker inflation pressures. Share

5d ago 14.56 CEST S&P Global have raised their forecast for the UK economy this year. They now expect UK GDP to rise by 0.6% this year, up from a previous forecast of 0.3%. Chief economist Paul Gruenwald says “the recovery in services in the first quarter has been stronger than expected” in the UK. However, the UK growth forecast in 2025 has been trimmed to 1.2%, from 1.4%. Spain’s growth forecast has also been revised up, to 2.2% in 2024 from 1.8%. This is to reflect “robust household balance sheets and rapid disinflation”, Gruenwald explains. Share

5d ago 14.35 CEST S&P Global: soft-landing narrative remains valid The global economy remain on track for a soft landing, as central banks start to lower interest rates followin recent falls in inflation. So says credit rating agency S&P Global, in its latest global economic update. S&P Global is still optimistic that policymakers will pull off a ‘soft landing’ – bringing down inflation without triggering a recession. It explains: GDP growth has moderated in most economies (the U.S. remains an outlier) and recessions have been avoided. Demand pressures have come down, bringing inflation back toward target. Services demand and employment remain robust, moderating the speed of decline, and bolstering the probability of a soft landing. S&P Global argues that central banks have reached “the beginning of the end-game”, as some – such as the Bank of Canada, the Swiss National Bank and the European Central Bank – have recently started cutting interest rates in response to falling inflation. Although inflation has been stickier than hoped, S&P Global argues this is “just the flipside” of resilient spending and strong jobs markets, and compatible with a soft landing. They say: A recession with a sharp drop in employment and labor demand would likely produce a faster decline in inflation, but is that what we really want? Share

5d ago 14.32 CEST Dominic Chappell must repay £50m over BHS collapse Back in the UK retail sector, the former head of BHS is digesting a court ruling that he must pay at least £50m to cover losses racked up before its collapse. Yeterday, a judge found that Dominic Chappell had sought to “plunder” the UK department store chain, which collapsed in 2016. Mr Justice Leech said Chappell had agreed to purchase BHS without “any prospect” of obtaining working capital to meet its day-to-day financial needs. He then took the “opportunity to plunder the BHS Group as and when he could”, the judge explained. The Financial Times has more details: At a hearing on Tuesday, the judge said Chappell “should make the payments” set out in a draft order. A copy of the order, seen by the Financial Times, shows the sums include £21.5m for a wrongful trading claim, £17.5m for breach of fiduciary duty, plus costs and interest, totalling at least £50m. Back in 2020, Chappell was been sentenced to six years in jail for evading tax on the £2.2m income he received from his doomed takeover of BHS.

LGIM continues to engage with companies on its divestment list and will take companies off the list when sufficient progress is made. Share Updated at 12.58 CEST

5d ago 12.05 CEST CBI: UK retail sales go into reverse Just in: UK retail sales have fallen faster than expected this month, as the sector went into reverse after May’s modest recovery. The CBI’s latest healthcheck on UK retailers, just released, found that retail sales volumes fell in the year to June, following a modest recovery in May. The CBI’s retail sales volume gauge fell to -24% this month, from +8% in May, showing that a majority of retailers reported a drop in volumes compared to the previous year.

Sales were reported to be below “average” for the time of year. Sales volumes are expected to remain below seasonal norms in July, albeit to a lesser extent. #DTS pic.twitter.com/RhJ7ohmOgj — CBI Economics (@CBI_Economics) June 26, 2024 The CBI explains: Sales were reported to be well below “average” for the time of year (-39% from +2% in May). Sales volumes are expected to remain below seasonal norms in July, albeit to a lesser extent (-29%).

Orders placed upon suppliers fell moderately in the year to June at a broadly similar pace to last month (-14% from -11% in May). Retailers expect the cutback in orders to continue next month (-16%). Alpesh Paleja, CBI interim deputy chief economist, says: “Last month’s nascent recovery in sales proved to be short-lived, with retailers reporting a faster-than-anticipated decline this month. Unseasonably cold weather in June may have played a role, but it’s notable that internet retail sales fell sharply in our survey, too. Consumer fundamentals are improving, with inflation now at the Bank of England’s 2% target and real incomes rising. But it’s clear that households are still struggling with the legacies of the cost-of-living crisis, with the level of prices still historically high in some areas. With consumer demand still on shaky ground, an incoming government can help business by ensuring that the UK is the most attractive place to start, grow and run a business. This will require bold action such as delivering a holistic cross-economy solution to the UK’s overly complex business rates system, which is a particular burden for retailers. This would help to alleviate the burden of higher costs.” Share

5d ago 11.34 CEST LGIM will also divest from TJX Legal & General Investment Management has also decided to divest its stake in US retail chain TJX, the parent company of UK chain TK Maxx. LGIM says TJX, like Glencore, failed to sufficiently address concerns raised in recent years about its environmental impact. LGIM says it concerned over TJX’s lack of a zero-deforestation policy and insufficient disclosure of “material Scope 3 emissions” that fail to account for its material value chains’ emissions. Today’s decisions will raise the number of divestments through LGIM’s Climate Impact Pledge to 16. LGIM says this “stewardship” of its investments is a critical lever in the global push to reach net zero. Stephen Beer, senior manager sustainability and responsible investment at Legal & General Investment Management, adds: We find that as time progresses, our conversations with companies can become harder-edged; not necessarily more difficult, but more focused. We use tools such as voting and divestment to encourage companies to meet our expectations on net-zero, while also sending a clear signal to the wider market. While divestment is one of the many stewardship tools we use as a mechanism for driving change, we see it as a last resort and by no means the last stage of engagement. Our engagement will continue, and where companies make sufficient progress, they will be reinstated. Ultimately, whilst we are focused on a net-zero objective, there is no one size fits all approach; our engagement approach is nuanced, it is about listening to companies and understanding the challenges they face, as well as the potential opportunities ahead, in accelerating the pace of the transition at a global scale.” Share","Share5d ago 14.56 CEST S&P Global have raised their forecast for the UK economy this year.

The Guardian,https://www.theguardian.com/business/article/2024/jun/26/universal-theme-park-bedfordshire-harry-potter-shrek-mario-kart,2024-06-26,13:29:33 UTC,Planned Universal theme park in Bedfordshire to ‘bring £50bn to UK economy’,"The movies group Universal has said a Hollywood theme park it plans to build in Bedfordshire, England, will be open 365 days a year and will boost the UK economy by nearly £50bn.

Universal Destinations & Experiences, which is owned by the US telecoms group Comcast, the parent company of Sky, plans to build on a 192-hectare site (476 acres) in Kempston Hardwick near Bedford. The company has an option to buy a further 25 hectares.

The theme park is expected to attract millions of visitors a year and would include a 500-room hotel and a dining area open to those without a theme park ticket.

The park’s experiences would include rides, shows and areas “based on the most popular films, video games and stories that people have enjoyed for decades”. Universal’s existing theme parks around the world feature Nintendo, Harry Potter and Shrek.

Construction is forecast to create 20,000 jobs and once open create 8,000 jobs initially, with more jobs likely over time, according to Universal. The company has pledged to pay the living wage to employees.

An analysis by Universal, produced in line with Treasury guidelines on economic appraisal, estimates the resort would bring in nearly £50bn of economic benefits to the UK.

The net economic contribution is forecast to be £35.1bn during construction and the first 20 years of operation. It would generate up to £14.1bn in additional tax returns over the same period, the study said.

Universal is still conducting due diligence and expects to decide on the project by the end of the year.

The new park, which would take five to six years to build, would be constructed on the site of Kempston Hardwick brickworks, once the world’s largest brickworks, which shut in 2008 and was demolished in September 2021.

The company said 92% of 6,000 people surveyed during a four-week public engagement period in May supported the theme park. It said it had “been delighted by the enthusiasm and overwhelmingly positive responses provided throughout the public engagement period”.

Page Thompson, Universal’s president in charge of new ventures, said: “A world-class theme park and resort from Universal has the potential to generate billions in economic benefit for the UK, by creating thousands of high-quality jobs and attracting millions of new visitors to the country.”

He told Sky News: “We’ve spent the last decade looking all over Europe and the United Kingdom for locations, and we think this is the best location we’ve ever seen.”

At the moment, Universal has five theme parks around the world: US parks in Hollywood, California, and at Orlando in Florida; as well as sites in Japan, China and Singapore.

Disneyland Paris, together with the associated Walt Disney Studios Park, is Europe’s biggest theme park, and attracts nearly 15 million visitors a year.","The movies group Universal has said a Hollywood theme park it plans to build in Bedfordshire, England, will be open 365 days a year and will boost the UK economy by nearly £50bn.

The Guardian,https://www.theguardian.com/environment/article/2024/jun/26/air-freight-greenhouse-gas-emissions-increase-post-pandemic-economy,2024-06-26,12:00:16 UTC,"Air freight greenhouse gas emissions up 25% since 2019, analysis finds","Air freight operators have increased their greenhouse gas emissions by 25% compared with 2019, analysis has found.

In 2023, air freight operators ran about 300,000 more flights than in 2019, an increase in flight volume of almost 30%. The US accounted for more than 40% of global air freight emissions, according to the report by campaign group Stand.earth.

Dr Devyani Singh, one of the authors of the analysis, described the expansion as “a new climate and human health threat” and urged air freight companies to “end their reliance on air cargo and shift freight shipments to lower-carbon modes of transport such as marine shipping or rail”.

Air freight produces an estimated 80 times more carbon than shipping by sea or truck, making it one of the most carbon-intensive transportation methods.

The researchers attribute the sharp increase to shifts in the post-pandemic economy and newfound consumer expectations in e-commerce, where rapid shipping has become the standard; Amazon’s Prime membership programme is used by more than 200 million people globally.

The researchers said that before the Covid-19 pandemic, air freight was reserved mostly for perishable goods, time-sensitive deliveries and luxury items. However, disruptions in the pandemic-era supply chain led to an unprecedented rise in the number of non-perishable and lower-value goods transported by air freight.

The report highlights a twofold reason for increased emissions. Before the pandemic, cargo was often transported in the belly of passenger planes. The dip in consumer demand for international air travel during the pandemic led to an expansion of cargo-only fleets to transport wares. This has not subsequently fallen, even as belly cargo emissions have returned post-pandemic.

By 2023, air freight emissions had increased by 25% from 2019, making up 93.8m tonnes overall. Meanwhile, belly cargo emissions have bounced back to almost 90% of 2019 levels.

FedEx and UPS were responsible for 24.7% of the industry’s carbon emissions in 2023. It is estimated that 99.8% of aviation fuel is produced from fossil fuels, with the scaling of low carbon replacements a distant prospect.

The Guardian,https://www.theguardian.com/business/article/2024/jun/26/it-doesnt-make-sense-why-us-tariffs-on-chinese-cleantech-risk-the-green-transition,2024-06-26,04:00:06 UTC,It doesn’t make sense: why US tariffs on Chinese cleantech risk the green transition | Jeffrey Frankel,"With historic heatwaves sweeping across the US and other parts of the northern hemisphere, June is expected to be the 13th consecutive month of record-breaking global temperatures. The primary cause, of course, is the enormous amount of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere. Despite the existential threat posed by rising atmospheric concentrations of greenhouse gases, emissions continue to increase at a faster pace than previously anticipated.

On one front, however, progress in the fight against the climate crisis has exceeded expectations. Amid the global shift from internal combustion engines to electric vehicles and the accelerated adoption of solar and wind power, demand for renewable energy is rapidly rising in the US and the EU.

This increased demand has been fuelled by significant declines in the real prices of solar panels, wind turbines, batteries, and EVs. In the US, this can be attributed in part to the clean-energy subsidies included in President Joe Biden’s Inflation Reduction Act and, more significantly, to low-cost Chinese imports.

Alarmingly, new tariffs imposed by the US and the EU on imports of solar panels, EVs, and other equipment, threaten to derail this progress. While estimating the cost of the clean energy transition is a difficult task, even conceptually, the global electricity sector alone is projected to require $3.5tn in capital investment annually between 2021 and 2050. Western countries have demanded that China pay its fair share of these costs, but their own trade policies are starkly at odds with their objectives.

Although the disproportionate targeting of cleantech imports from China dates back more than a decade, the trend accelerated significantly under former US president Donald Trump and has continued under Biden. In May, the Biden administration imposed a 100% tariff on Chinese EVs, along with new levies on a range of other Chinese goods, including solar cells and lithium-ion batteries.

These measures aim to protect American workers and critical domestic industries. But they risk undermining the administration’s climate agenda, particularly its efforts to raise the share of renewables to 100% of US electricity by 2035 and the share of EVs to 50% of new car sales by 2030.

The new US tariffs could extend beyond China’s national borders. In response to western tariffs, some Chinese manufacturers have moved to south-east Asia in recent years. Earlier this month, the US International Trade Commission decided to investigate claims by American solar-cell companies seeking to impose countervailing and anti-dumping duties on south-east Asian manufacturers. This decision comes despite opposition from US solar-power developers who rely on imported equipment for domestic production.

Meanwhile, the European Commission has imposed provisional tariffs on Chinese EVs after an eight-month investigation found that China’s “unfair subsidisation” of its EV industry undercuts EU competitors. The new EU tariffs, while not prohibitive, average 31%, which is substantially higher than the duties on conventional car imports from other trading partners.

To be sure, while historically low labour costs and economies of scale have helped reduce the price of Chinese solar panels and EVs, generous government subsidies – often in the form of cheap credit – have also played a significant role. But it remains unclear how blocking these low-cost imports, as many western politicians propose, would benefit workers and consumers in the US and the EU. Do American and European policymakers prefer that their own taxpayers, instead of Chinese citizens, bear the costs of clean-energy subsidies? Recall that western countries wanted China to pay its fair share of the energy transition.

Admittedly, promoting climate policies by emphasising their potential to create green jobs for domestic workers could be an effective political strategy. But we should recognise that these arguments are political, not economic.

Although US tariffs may help create jobs in the solar-panel industry, those would be offset by job losses in the solar-energy installation sector, which relies on low-cost equipment. Similarly, some EV production jobs would disappear if tariffs led to higher prices for battery imports. Meanwhile, many export jobs would be cut when China and other countries inevitably retaliate against western restrictions.

With US unemployment at 4%, policymakers and voters are now more concerned about inflation than jobs. Removing tariffs is the surest way for western governments to lower energy and transportation prices, thereby reducing inflation. This is yet another example of how international trade could lower the costs of the clean-energy transition – if we were to embrace it.

Jeffrey Frankel is a professor of capital formation and growth at Harvard University. He served as a member of President Bill Clinton’s Council of Economic Advisers.

© Project Syndicate","In the US, this can be attributed in part to the clean-energy subsidies included in President Joe Biden’s Inflation Reduction Act and, more significantly, to low-cost Chinese imports.
In May, the Biden administration imposed a 100% tariff on Chinese EVs, along with new levies on a range of other Chinese goods, including solar cells and lithium-ion batteries.
In response to western tariffs, some Chinese manufacturers have moved to south-east Asia in recent years.
Meanwhile, the European Commission has imposed provisional tariffs on Chinese EVs after an eight-month investigation found that China’s “unfair subsidisation” of its EV industry undercuts EU competitors.
The new EU tariffs, while not prohibitive, average 31%, which is substantially higher than the duties on conventional car imports from other trading partners.","['chinese', 'share', 'eu', 'risk', 'green', 'imports', 'energy', 'doesnt', 'tariffs', 'evs', 'cleantech', 'frankel', 'western', 'solar', 'jobs', 'transition', 'sense', 'jeffrey']",https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/a5f4dab354e4721f108f6b717f690f8eaa2bb688/0_146_5472_3283/master/5472.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctb3BpbmlvbnMucG5n&enable=upscale&s=a012d3fc27fee944b54646c1375f190d,True,histor heatwav sweep across us part northern hemispher june expect th consecut month recordbreak global temperatur primari caus cours enorm amount greenhous gase atmospher despit existenti threat pose rise atmospher concentr greenhous gase emiss continu increas faster pace previous anticip one front howev progress fight climat crisi exceed expect amid global shift intern combust engin electr vehicl acceler adopt solar wind power demand renew energi rapid rise us eu increas demand fuell signific declin real price solar panel wind turbin batteri ev us attribut part cleanenergi subsidi includ presid joe biden 's inflat reduct act and signific lowcost chines import alarm new tariff impos us eu import solar panel ev equip threaten derail progress estim cost clean energi transit difficult task even conceptu global electr sector alon project requir tn capit invest annual western countri demand china pay fair share cost trade polici stark odd object although disproportion target cleantech import china date back decad trend acceler signific former us presid donald trump continu biden may biden administr impos tariff chines ev along new levi rang chines good includ solar cell lithiumion batteri measur aim protect american worker critic domest industri risk undermin administr 's climat agenda particular effort rais share renew us electr share ev new car sale new us tariff could extend beyond china 's nation border respons western tariff chines manufactur move southeast asia recent year earlier month us intern trade commiss decid investig claim american solarcel compani seek impos countervail antidump duti southeast asian manufactur decis come despit opposit us solarpow develop reli import equip domest product meanwhil european commiss impos provision tariff chines ev eightmonth investig found china 's `` unfair subsidis '' ev industri undercut eu competitor new eu tariff prohibit averag substanti higher duti convent car import trade partner sure histor low labour cost economi scale help reduc price chines solar panel ev generous govern subsidi - often form cheap credit - also play signific role remain unclear block lowcost import mani western politician propos would benefit worker consum us eu american european policymak prefer taxpay instead chines citizen bear cost cleanenergi subsidi recal western countri want china pay fair share energi transit admit promot climat polici emphasis potenti creat green job domest worker could effect polit strategi recognis argument polit econom skip past newslett promot sign first thing free daili newslett us morn brief break key stori day tell what 's happen matter enter email address sign privaci notic newslett may contain info chariti onlin ad content fund outsid parti inform see newslett may contain info chariti onlin ad content fund outsid parti inform see privaci polici use googl recaptcha protect websit googl privaci polici term servic appli newslett promot although us tariff may help creat job solarpanel industri would offset job loss solarenergi instal sector reli lowcost equip similar ev product job would disappear tariff led higher price batteri import meanwhil mani export job would cut china countri inevit retali western restrict us unemploy policymak voter concern inflat job remov tariff surest way western govern lower energi transport price therebi reduc inflat yet anoth exampl intern trade could lower cost cleanenergi transit - embrac it jeffrey frankel professor capit format growth harvard univers serv member presid bill clinton 's council econom advis ( c ) project syndic
The Guardian,https://www.theguardian.com/business/article/2024/jul/01/french-markets-marine-le-pen-euro-dollar,2024-07-01,12:21:48 UTC,French market leaps amid hopes Le Pen will fall short of outright victory,"Shares on the French stock market have risen after the first round of voting in the country’s parliamentary election eased concerns about an outright victory for the rightwing National Rally (RN) party.

The euro rose against the dollar, while the risk premium investors demand for holding French government bonds fell as the markets took the view that the result could have been worse.

But despite a 1.5% jump in France’s benchmark stock market measure – the Cac 40 – on Monday, shares have fallen 5% in the past month amid fears that Marine Le Pen’s RN could still emerge from next Sunday’s second round of voting with an overall majority.

RN secured 33% of the vote, while the leftwing New Popular Front secured 28% and Emmanuel Macron’s centrist bloc won the support of 20% of those who voted.

Alex Everett, an investment manager at the fund management company abrdn, said: “We are not out of the woods yet. The National Rally exceeded expectations and may yet pick up the second-round votes for a relative or even absolute majority.

“Intense horse trading until Tuesday evening will likely see deals cut between the left and centre parties to try to derail this.”

On Friday, the gap between the interest rate (yield) on French and German bonds had widened to its highest since the eurozone debt crisis in 2012, but the spread narrowed slightly from 0.85 percentage points to 0.75 points after the results came in. The gap was less than 0.5 points before the snap election was called.

Krishna Guha, an analyst at the US investment bank Evercore, said: “The vote is far from definitive but leans in favour of the less bad scenario of a hung parliament, political paralysis in Paris and chronic dysfunction at the EU level rather than the worse scenarios of an outright win for the far right or far left that might directly lead to a new European sovereign crisis.”

The Guardian,https://www.theguardian.com/business/article/2024/jun/26/human-rights-group-fca-shein-lse-flotation-uyghurs,2024-06-26,16:11:48 UTC,Human rights group urges UK financial regulator to block Shein’s LSE flotation,"A human rights group has urged Britain’s financial regulator to block the Chinese fast-fashion retailer Shein’s planned blockbuster flotation on the London Stock Exchange.

Stop Uyghur Genocide, a UK-based human rights charity that alleges minority Uyghur people are being used as forced labour at some of Shein’s cotton suppliers in China’s north-western Xinjiang region, has begun a legal campaign against the planned stock market listing.

Represented by the law firm Leigh Day, the campaign group has written to the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) to argue that “any attempt by Shein to list on the LSE should be refused”.

The China-founded company, which was valued at $66bn (£52bn) in a fundraising round last year, began to explore a listing on the LSE early this year, and is expected to file a prospectus with the UK regulator soon. Shein abandoned its original plan to list in New York after opposition from US politicians.

On Tuesday, Amnesty International UK said Shein’s potential London listing would be a “badge of shame” for the London market because of the fast-fashion firm’s “questionable” labour and human rights standards.

The fast-fashion retailer said on Wednesday: “Shein has a zero-tolerance policy for forced labour and we are committed to respecting human rights. We take visibility across our entire supply chain seriously and we require our contract manufacturers to only source cotton from approved regions.”

Stop Uyghur Genocide said it had reminded the FCA that its US counterpart, the Securities and Exchange Commission, has already refused to recommend the listing of Shein for trading on the US stock exchange because of concerns around labour practices in the company’s supply chains.

The group said the London listing should not be allowed to go ahead because the UK has signed up to International Labour Organization conventions, which set out minimum standards for engaging workers. Any concerns about companies engaging workers in their supply chains that may breach those minimum standards are inconsistent with the UK’s convention obligations, it said.

“The FCA has a statutory duty of integrity and to protect its investors,” the group added.

The Leigh Day solicitor Ricardo Gama, who represents Stop Uyghur Genocide, said: “Stop Uyghur Genocide expects UK financial institutions to uphold the high ethical standards that they pay lip service to, and to make clear that London isn’t the place to come for a ‘no questions asked’ approach to capital. At the very minimum regulators must make sure that laws in place to root out modern slavery are complied with.”

Stop Uyghur Genocide said it was concerned about the London Stock Exchange’s ability to detect and respond to any alleged forced labour in Shein’s supply chains.

Stop Uyghur Genocide is preparing a detailed submission to the regulator to support its letter.

In the meantime, the campaign group’s lawyers have asked the FCA to obtain more information from Shein about the “accuracy of its published modern slavery statement”.



Under the Modern Slavery Act, large businesses have to publish a statement every year that sets out the measures they have taken to ensure slavery and trafficking do not occur in their own operations and their supply chains.

Leigh Day lawyers have urged the regulator to “refuse Shein’s listing application unless the FCA is satisfied that its products are not tainted by forced labour”.

Rahima Mahmut, executive director of Stop Uyghur Genocide, said she was “deeply concerned” about Shein’s potential London listing and said the organisation had been highlighting concerns from national security and human rights experts that Shein “could be associated with egregious human rights abuses, including modern slavery, and pose ethical and security risks to businesses and citizens”.

“Our investment community must not support companies like Shein who are reportedly linked to the Chinese state and which we believe may enable the ongoing genocidal policies against Uyghurs.”

The FCA declined to comment on Shein’s potential listing. It noted that it has no investigation or enforcement powers relating to alleged breaches of legislation not within its remit, such as the Modern Slavery Act or tax legislation.

Before a company’s shares can be admitted to the LSE, the firm must apply to the FCA for admission to listing and to approve its prospectus. The watchdog said it was the company’s responsibility to ensure the information in its prospectus is accurate, and not the FCA’s role to independently verify the accurate of information.

Michael Polak, barrister and chair of Lawyers for Uyghur Rights, said: “A firm alleged to have involvement in goods directly produced by slave labour in the Uyghur region creates a risk that those vital principles will be violated. We will ask the FCA to consider the expert evidence that we will provide to them before deciding on a public listing in the UK.”","A human rights group has urged Britain’s financial regulator to block the Chinese fast-fashion retailer Shein’s planned blockbuster flotation on the London Stock Exchange.

6d ago 16.12 CEST US consumer confidence dips US consumer morale has dropped this month, a new survey shows, but was stronger than expected. The Conference Board’s consumer confidence index dipped in June to 100.4, down from 101.3 in May. Economists had expected it would fall more, to exactly 100. The decline was due to a deteriorating short-term outlook for income, business, and conditions in the jobs market. Dana M. Peterson, chief economist at The Conference Board, explains: “Confidence pulled back in June but remained within the same narrow range that’s held throughout the past two years, as strength in current labor market views continued to outweigh concerns about the future. However, if material weaknesses in the labor market appear, Confidence could weaken as the year progresses.” 📈😁Americans are feeling confident!

Barclays has reduced rates by more than 0.25 percentage points in some cases from Tuesday, and its cuts led to a quick response from HSBC, which said it would be cutting rates across its home loans range with effect from Wednesday. While new home loan rates have been broadly stable over the last month or two, the pricing of some deals has crept up. However, recent improvements to money market swap rates – which largely determine the pricing of new fixed deals – appear to have prompted two of the biggest mortgage lenders to reduce their rates, with others predicted to follow suit.

6d ago 15.03 CEST Over in Canada, inflation has jumped unexpectedly. Consumer prices across the Canadian economy rose by 2.9% in the year to May, up from 2.7% in April, dashing hopes of a small fall.

Faster price growth for services was led by cellular services, travel tours, rent and air transportation. Prices for goods (+1.0%) grew at the same rate as in April. Not a surprise in the least.

6d ago 14.44 CEST Amnesty: Shein’s floatation would be a ‘badge of shame’ for London Stock Exchange Human rights organisation Amnesty International has hit out at plans for China’s fast fashion group Shein to float on the London Stock Exchange. It emerged yesterday that Shein has confidentially filed for a public listing in London, which could value the company at around £50bn. This would be London’s biggest ever float. Shein wins Labour support as it prepares £50bn London listing Read more But Dominique Muller, Amnesty International researcher specialising in the garment industry, says the City should demand transparent and binding safeguards regarding human rights standards, before admitting Shein to the fold: ​“It’s deeply troubling that a company with questionable labour and human rights standards and an unsustainable fast fashion business model could be set to reap hundreds of millions of pounds via a sale of shares and a listing on the London Stock Exchange. “Where SHEIN goes, others will try to follow. The UK authorities and the London Stock Exchange should not facilitate SHEIN’s listing until transparent and binding safeguards regarding internationally accepted human rights standards covering its entire supply chain are agreed and applied, and any abuses identified fully remedied. “Rewarding SHEIN’s current methods via a flotation would be a badge of shame for the London Stock Exchange, the bankers helping bring it to market, and any investors set to profit from it. It would be an appalling example of a process which delivers for the rich by squeezing the poor. It validates the view that it is acceptable to regard workers and their rights, company products and the environment as expendable – which cheapens us all. “It is essential the new UK government does not allow a race to the bottom in terms of corporate and human rights standards. It should require companies to prevent serious environmental harms and human rights abuses occurring throughout their entire operations and supply chains. It should enable workers whose rights are abused by company activities anywhere in the world recourse to justice through UK courts.” Shein has been accused of using forced labour to make its affordable clothing, such as t-shirts and sweaters. ‘Worst of the worst’: why is fast fashion retailer Shein launching a reality show?

6d ago 14.25 CEST Fed Governor Bowman open to raising rates if inflation doesn’t improve A US central bank policymaker has indicated she would be open to raising interest rates if inflation not fall as hoped. In a speech in London today, Federal Reserve governor Michelle Bowman also said the time is not right yet to start lowering borrowing costs. Bowman explained: Should the incoming data indicate that inflation is moving sustainably toward our 2% goal, it will eventually become appropriate to gradually lower the federal funds rate to prevent monetary policy from becoming overly restrictive. However, we are still not yet at the point where it is appropriate to lower the policy rate. In my view, we should consider a range of possible scenarios that could unfold when considering how the FOMC’s monetary policy decisions may evolve. I remain willing to raise the target range for the federal funds rate at a future meeting should progress on inflation stall or even reverse. Latest comments from Fed's Bowman, though at the more hawkish end of the spectrum, suggest chances of the US Fed cutting rates this year (notwithstanding the Nov Presidential Elections) rapidly receding.

The recalls are the latest setback for the vehicle whose mass production is expected to start next year, points out Reuters: Tesla recalls thousands of Cybertrucks over windshield wiper, exterior trim issues https://t.co/b7II0KRQi2 pic.twitter.com/Hk0xzxOkQE — Reuters U.S. News (@ReutersUS) June 25, 2024 Share Updated at 14.13 CEST

6d ago 13.56 CEST Microsoft president Brad Smith has responded to the EC’s statement of objections about Teams bundling, saying: “Having unbundled Teams and taken initial interoperability steps, we appreciate the additional clarity provided today and will work to find solutions to address the Commission’s remaining concerns.” Share

6d ago 13.36 CEST Margrethe Vestager, executive vice-president in charge of EC competition policy, says: We are concerned that Microsoft may be giving its own communication product Teams an undue advantage over competitors, by tying it to its popular productivity suites for businesses. And preserving competition for remote communication and collaboration tools is essential as it also fosters innovation on these markets. If confirmed, Microsoft’s conduct would be illegal under our competition rules. Microsoft now has the opportunity to reply to our concerns. Share

6d ago 13.33 CEST Microsoft faces a hefty antitrust fine if the EC’s charges over Teams bundling are upheld, points out Reuters. It risks a fine of as much as 10% of its global annual turnover if it is found guilty of the antitrust breaches announced today. Reuters adds: Two decades after Microsoft’s last EU fine, the EU competition watchdog’s latest action was triggered by a 2020 complaint from rival workspace messaging app Slack, owned by Salesforce. The U.S. tech giant had to pay €2.2bn ($2.4 billion) in EU antitrust fines two decades ago for tying, or bundling, two or more products together.

Posting on X, Breton says: For too long Apple has been squeezing out innovative companies — denying consumers new opportunities & choices.

7d ago 15.52 CEST The Bloomberg debate wrapped up with quick statements from the two protagonists. Jonathan Reynolds goes first, saying businesses are facing too many serious challenges to risk another five years of a chaotic and unstable government. “It’s time to return to a government that solves problems, rather than causing then”, he says, pledging to keep working with businesses after the election. Kemi Badenoch says the difference between the two parties is that Labour want to bring in new laws that make it harder to hire staff, and to micro manage businesses. Conservatives believe in capitalism, she pledges, the power of business to do good. “We don’t think profit is a dirty word, and we are optimistic about our future,” Badenoch concludes. Share Updated at 16.21 CEST

7d ago 15.47 CEST Badenoch and Reynolds on leadership ambitions And finally… Q: Bloomberg turns to its guests’ leadership ambitions. Jonathan Reynolds gets the giggles, turning red, before insisting he is “very much focused” on becoming the secretary state for business and trade. Keir Starmer has done a “quite exceptional” job of turning Labour around, he adds. Kemi Badenoch (who has been cited as a potential leader if the Conservatives are hammered in next month’s election) says the question was obviously meant for her (getting Reynolds guffawing). Badenoch says she stood for the leadership before, and lost, and is now “terrified” at the prospect of Labour coming into power. She insisted there was “no better job” than Business and Trade Secretary, which “is a lot easier and a lot less pressured than being prime minister”. Q: Some cabinet ministers may lose their seats… would you be up for the leadership challenge if it came up? Badenoch says leadership issues will be discussed after the election, not before…. That doesn’t exactly rule out a Badenoch bid… and appears to leave the door open for one…. Share Updated at 16.22 CEST

7d ago 15.40 CEST Q: Should Thames Water be nationalised? Kemi Badenoch says Thames Water is a “very, very difficult” situation; she doesn’t want to move markets by discussing nationalisation while it is going through difficulties. Reminder: The Guardian reported in April that the government was considering radical plans to renationalise Thames Water, under which most of its £15.6bn debt would be added to the public purse. The palava with Thames Water shows that the UK’s regulatory system is not working well, as the company tries to make a profit, keep bills low, and invest in infrastructure. Jonathan Reynolds says people are unhappy about the state of the UK water industry. Reynolds hopes that nationalisation can be avoided, pointing out that investment must involve losing as well as gaining money. Share

7d ago 15.35 CEST Reynolds: Shein London listing would help regulate company Onto topical issues. Q: Have you met with Shein, and would you put any restrictions if they chose to list in the UK [a decision which is moving closer…]. Jonathan Reynolds says Labour have met with Shein. Many people who are considering economic activity in the UK have spoken to Labour in recent years, he explains. His view is that if companies are doing businesses in the UK, they should be regulated from the UK. So, a listing would be the way to enforce the “highest standards” on, for example, the labour market, regulatory compliance, or tax. Any listed company in the UK has a fairly significant set of compliance placed upon them. If you are keen to see businesses operating to the highest standards, you should want to see them do that from the UK. Kemi Badenoch, the current business and trade secretary, reveals she has NOT met with Shein. She has two concerns with a potential Shein listing in London. 1) The way Shein ships individually packaged orders directly from Chinese warehouses to consumers’ homes, meaning they fall below the £135 threshold for import duty “That could mean quite a lot lost in terms of taxes,” Badenoch says. 2) Concerns that Shein are using forced labor in Xinjiang. Share

7d ago 15.23 CEST Q: What’s your policy on money from the Middle East and China? Jonathan Reynolds says Labour is extremely keen to bring in overseas investment. The Gulf is an “obvious place to look for that” money, he says, while China brings different considerations in terms of national security. Labour will hold an investment summit in its first 100 days of power, he says, and ‘make the case’ for investing in Britain. ‘It won’t take as long as people think’: Rachel Reeves on being ‘scrappy’ – and changing Britain Read more Reynolds says many of Labour’s plans come from the “reasonable complaints” of businesses who said they considered investing in the UK, but were put off by the prime minister changing, or because they didn’t know the country’s plans post-2016 (the year of the Brexit vote). Kemi Badenoch says the UK already has the largest foreign domestic investment of an European country. Share Updated at 15.24 CEST

7d ago 15.18 CEST Q: What will you do to help small businesses get paid on time? Kemi Badenoch says it is “extraordinary” how larger corporations treat smaller firms in their supply chain. “We will look again” at more regulations to speed up payments, she pledges. Jonathan Reynolds says Labour would force the audit committees of large public companies to say how quickly they pay their suppliers – that would address the power inbalance that allows them to leave small firms waiting for money…. Share

7d ago 15.11 CEST Kemi Badenoch is then asked about why more trade deals haven’t been signed. Badenoch says the US government is not signing any free trade deals at the moment, so the UK has been signing agreements with individual US states instead. It has been “very difficult” negotiating with India, she adds; any deal with Delhi has to work for business. UK and India put free trade deal talks on ice until later this year Read more Share

7d ago 15.07 CEST Jonathan Reynolds says Labour will improve the UK’s relationship with the European Union – starting with it not being governed by the internal politics of the Conservative Party. He says Labour will seek to reduce checks on food and agricultural products, and to improve the mutual recognition of professional qualifications. Reynolds argues that ‘relitigating the arguments on the customs unions or the single markets would not provide the stability Britain needs. Q: The EU say they’re open to negotiating a deal to ease border friction for fresh food, for example, but it must have a role for the European Court of Justice. Will you accept that? Reynolds says Labour won’t give away its negotiating hand. But surely, if you don’t want lower food standards than the EU, you can remove some of the trade frictions and costs. Kemi Badenoch says the Conservative government tried to strike such a deal, but the EU wouldn’t accept it. She insists the UK can’t accept oversight by the ECJ. Share

24 Jun 2024 14.59 CEST Onto Brexit! Q: What is your top proposal to cut costs for businesses exporting to the EU? Kemi Badenoch claims that it’s hard to tell the impact of Brexit, versus the impact of the pandemic. But she insists that services exports have been “going gangbusters”, making the UK the 2nd largest services exporter, and the 4th largest exporter in the world. “Those are facts”. Well….. this thread from Sky News’s Ed Conway shows that the picture is not quite as rosy as that: First thing to say is that the bare bones of the claim are certainly true.

Between 2021 and 2022 the UK did indeed rise from 7th in the league table of the world's biggest exporters (counting both goods and services) to 4th.

We'll get to why this happened in a moment. But still pic.twitter.com/jaZfDbHbsx — Ed Conway (@EdConwaySky) June 23, 2024 However here's some (very) important context.

It's not like the UK has only JUST hit fourth spot. In fact, it was in 4th place in 2020. And in 2015, 2014 and 2013.

Actually if you look at the modal average of our position in the past decade it was... fourth. pic.twitter.com/mKOsTe2Qtu — Ed Conway (@EdConwaySky) June 23, 2024 So that ""leapfrogging"" notion is wrong.

If anything the outlier here was 2021, where we dropped to the lowest position we'd EVER been in, going back two decades or so.

Raising the question: what happened? Forget leapfrogging - why did we drop down?

Brexit? Covid? Something else? pic.twitter.com/V3VlkjFLGy — Ed Conway (@EdConwaySky) June 23, 2024 Having looked into this, I can tell you at least part of the answer comes back to gold.

If u follow me you've prob already heard this, but UK trade figs are MASSIVELY distorted by flows of gold into & out of London vaults.

Film I made about this years ago https://t.co/Vgd3ONcNZQ — Ed Conway (@EdConwaySky) June 23, 2024 And gold flows have been a very big distortionary factor in UK trade post 2019. Just LOOK at how much of the total UK export figure since then has been gold: a LOT.

Even tho we don't mine sizeable amounts of gold, it's routinely been one of our biggest ""exports"" in recent years pic.twitter.com/SVP6sWfngY — Ed Conway (@EdConwaySky) June 23, 2024 Now, nearly every trade statistician agrees you should exclude gold from trade stats. After all, this is more of a financial transaction than a traded good.

The @ONS already excludes gold from most of its figs. More on this here: https://t.co/Ihz5gH6rY0 — Ed Conway (@EdConwaySky) June 23, 2024 But those UNCTAD trade league tables don't, as far as I can tell, exclude gold.

And this is relevant. Because look: in 2021 UK gold exports dropped a LOT. In 2022 they bounced back to the highest level ever, boosting TOTAL UK exports by a whopping 4% (that's MASSIVE). pic.twitter.com/GAPDjsETGJ — Ed Conway (@EdConwaySky) June 23, 2024 Raising the question, what does our trade picture look like if you EXCLUDE gold.

Are we still in fourth place?

In short: no.

Look, ex gold, our ranking would have been 6th last year. Not 4th.

In fact we wouldn't have hit 6th since 2015. Which is consistent with other datapoints. pic.twitter.com/POeOJU04pf — Ed Conway (@EdConwaySky) June 23, 2024 Share

24 Jun 2024 14.53 CEST Reynolds: Need to escape low-growth, high-tax, poor-services doom loop Next issue – fiscal issues, and the IMF’s warning that both major parties’ manifestos are too opaque and lack detail on tax and spend. Q: They say voters will be voting in a knowledge vacuum…. Kemi Badenoch says she “completely disagrees” with IFS’s assessment. The truth is that people are not placing their votes based on the IFS’s analysis, but actually base it on what a party believes in, and what its values are. She says the mini-budget showed the problems of cutting tax without cutting spending. We are the party of sound money, of business, Badenoch promises. Jonathan Reynolds says he respects the IFS…. and agrees that the Conservatives record speaks for itself (!). Taxes are at a record high, and public services don’t reflect that tax burden. The key is to break out of this low-growth, high-tax, poor-services doom loop, Reynolds says – and that’s Labour’s plan. He says the UK would have billions of pounds more, if the economy had grown at the rate of the last Labour government. Q: Are you ready to fight interest groups which won’t like the planning changes you have in mind? Reynolds says that’s why Labour needs a mandate, so it can build the homes and infrastructure Britain needs. Kemi Badenoch disputes this claim, pointing out that Labour members of the House of Lords had blocked the government’s attempts to remove nutrient neutrality rules, and free up housebuilding. Share

24 Jun 2024 14.40 CEST Reynoldsd defends Labour's plans for workers rights Next, a question on Labour’s plans for more protection against unfair dismissal, and ending zero-hours contracts. Q: Is a Labour government going to make life much harder for small businesses? Jonathan Reynolds says Labour’s manifesto is “a pro-worker, pro-business” agenda, that – he says – has been developed closely with businesses. That includes a better business environment, changes to planning rules, certainty on tax, that will deliver more growth. Reynolds adds that “The floor will rise”, but insists the vast majority of businesses are already operating at a much higher level than this new, higher floor already. Kemi Badenoch hits back, saying it’s businesses don’t want these measures. She claims it’s “unbelievable” that Reynolds claims these new regulations have been developed with businesses. She insists: Businesss is terrified of what Labour is selling. Badenoch says Labour’s plans for employment rights from day one are unpopular, and that the CEOs of Asda, Currys [see here] and M&S have said these are “terrible regulations”. Reynolds returns fire, saying that the Conservative Party promised an employment bill after Brexit, and security in the workplace, and hasn’t delivered on it. Labour, he says, will create a better working environment, one where people have secure work they can build a family round. Badenoch won’t accept this, telling business leaders they should be “absolutely terrified” of “surrendering” your business, the economy, and tax, to Labour. Badenoch argues that Labour are “fishing in an empty barrel”, and that flexible working rights are not the cause of problems in the UK economy. Share Updated at 14.52 CEST

24 Jun 2024 14.25 CEST Jonathan Reynolds agrees that governments must change their plans when circumstances change… …and blames Liz Truss’s “disastrous mini-budget” for forcing Labour to drop its £28bn green investment plans. He then returns to his criticism of Rishi Sunak’s climate u-turn speech last September, in which the PM pushed back the deadline for selling new petrol and diesel cars and the phasing out of gas boilers. That was a “short-lived relaunch of the Rishi Sunak premiership”, Reynolds says, to pitch the PM as a change candidate.

The Guardian,https://www.theguardian.com/business/article/2024/jun/24/london-tunnels-ipo-amsterdam-uk-markets,2024-06-24,13:18:16 UTC,London Tunnels moves IPO plan to Amsterdam in blow to UK markets,"London Tunnels, which aims to convert an abandoned underground network into a tourist attraction, has ditched plans to float in the capital, instead opting to list in Amsterdam.

The company aims to make the Kingsway exchange tunnels, a network of 8,000 sq metres under Holborn in central London, into a new attraction that will bring in 2 million visitors a year.

The group revealed on Monday that it hoped to raise £30m by listing on Euronext Amsterdam, saying it could make the most of the size and scale of the equity and capital markets of Europe by listing in the Dutch capital.

The decision comes after the company sent papers to the London Stock Exchange (LSE) in January outlining its intention to float in the capital.

At the time, its chief executive, Angus Murray, said: “This unique set of tunnels, owned by a British company, built by the British government, for the defence of Britain, that can further enhance London’s reputation as a leading tourist destination, should be listed in London.”

The change of heart by the company is the latest blow to the LSE after a number of high-profile companies opted to list in Europe and the US ahead of London in recent months.

In May, the Paddy Power owner, Flutter, announced its decision to switch its primary listing to New York, while the UK chip designer Arm opted to list on Wall Street last August after the government failed to convince it to float in London.

However, this has been partly offset by big players such as the fashion retail company Shein and Raspberry Pi announcing plans to list on the LSE.

The Kingsway tunnels were built in the early 1940s to shelter up to 8,000 people during the blitz but were never used for this purpose.

Instead, the Special Operations Executive, responsible for organising espionage and sabotage operations in German-occupied Europe, moved in during the final two years of the war and is thought to be the inspiration for the Q branch in Ian Fleming’s James Bond novels.

The tunnels later housed the first secure transatlantic telephone cable, which ran a hotline that connected the White House and the Kremlin during the cold war, before ownership was transferred to British Telecom (BT) in 1981.

London Tunnels has agreed to buy the site from BT next year and intends to open the attraction in 2027, including exhibits celebrating the history of the tunnels, as well as reinstating the city’s deepest London bar, which closed in the 1980s.

However, the float prospectus lists a number of risk factors to the project, including the warning that plans could be delayed if it cannot get the full planning permission it needs.

Last month, it secured the planning green light from the City of London Corporation but is still awaiting planning signoff from the London borough of Camden.

The list also includes risks around whether the structural integrity of the tunnels is affected by their age, the possibility that the removal of asbestos from the tunnels may take longer than expected, and that the company may be unable to complete the acquisition of the leasehold on the agreed date of 30 June next year.

Explaining its decision for moving the listing, London Tunnels said it could meet the £20m to £30m needed over the first few years of development. It added that it would then look to raise a further £120m in debt and equity to make the tunnels operational.","London Tunnels, which aims to convert an abandoned underground network into a tourist attraction, has ditched plans to float in the capital, instead opting to list in Amsterdam.

Unite is suspending its industrial action, it said, after the news on Thursday that the Indian conglomerate owner, Tata, would, in response, close the site earlier than first announced.

Talks throughout the weekend yielded a ""significant development"" in the form of an agreement from Tata to discuss future investment and not just redundancies, the union said.

The closure date is now 7 July, the day before the previously planned strike and roughly two months before the September timeline originally announced to close the final blast furnace in which steel is made.

Up to 2,800 jobs are to be lost - 2,500 in the next year, and a further 300 in three years - despite a £500m taxpayer cash injection to support the site's transition to cheaper, greener steel production to cut emissions.

The first steel blast furnace was due to close at the end of June in a push to reduce carbon emissions at what is the UK's single largest source of CO2.

The previous fossil-fuel-powered blast furnaces are being replaced by a single electric arc furnace.

Union response

Unite members were striking in protest against job losses and the effects on the local community.

The early closure decision by Tata was last week described as being the ""latest In a long line of threats that won't deter us"" by Unite's secretary general Sharon Graham.

""The strikes will go on until Tata halts its disastrous plans,"" she said on Thursday. An overtime ban had already been in effect from 17 June. But both actions have been suspended now for further talks.

Another union representing Port Talbot steelworkers welcomed Unite's industrial action pause and the fact it was getting ""back around the table with their sister steel unions"".

Alun Davies, the national officer for Community (the steelworkers' union), said Tata would resume discussions if the strike was called off.

""The truth is Tata never walked away from those discussions, and at our last meeting on 22 May all unions agreed to conclude the negotiations and put the outcome to our members. Community will welcome resuming those discussions, but we regret that zero progress has been made since 22 May.""

Despite wages rising above the rate of inflation in recent months and house prices falling from the record high of summer 2022, ""housing affordability is still stretched"", Nationwide said.

Money latest: New Wotsits and Monster Munch flavours launch today - but you should read small print

A greater proportion of take-home pay is going on mortgage bills, according to the lender's house price index.

Someone earning the average UK income seeking to buy their first home with a deposit worth 20% of the asking price will have a monthly mortgage bill of 37% of their end pay packet.

It's above the long-standing average of 30%.

The mortgages affect

While people have been typically earning more and house prices are 3% lower than the all-time high two years ago, rising mortgage costs have made unaffordability worse.

Please use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player 3:44 Lloyds Banking Group chief executive Charlie Nunn said the era of ultra low interest rates is over.

With high interest rates - raised to 5.25% by the Bank of England to bring down inflation - have come more expensive mortgage costs.

According to Nationwide, the interest rate on a five-year fixed-rate deal for a borrower with a 25% deposit was 1.3% in late 2021. That has soared and is now around 4.7%.

Latest official figures showed basic pay grew 6% in the three months to April, while inflation - the rate of price rises - was 2.3% in the same month. But data from living-standards thinktank the Resolution Foundation said weekly wages have increased by just £16 in 14 years when inflation is factored in.

Compounding affordability problems is the fact UK house prices are back on the rise and were 1.5% more last month compared to June 2023.

Fewer mortgages, more cash

There have been fewer house-buying transactions over the past year, Nationwide added.

The total number of transactions is down by roughly 15% compared to the pre-pandemic year of 2019.

Higher borrowing costs have meant transactions involving a mortgage are down even more, nearly 25%.

Cash transactions, however, are up 5% on pre-pandemic levels.

Figures released by the Bank of England on Monday morning showed mortgage approvals continued to fall.

House sales are likely to fall as the number of mortgages approved dropped to 60,000 in May from 60,800 in April.

Would-be buyers borrowed half the amount of money to purchase a home, the Bank said, £1.2bn was loaned in May, down from £2.2bn in April.

The same data showed that personal lending, such as credit card debt and personal loans, grew. It suggests increased consumer demand.

The cap, which limits what suppliers can charge per unit of energy, fell by 7% overnight in the wake of the latest three-month review by industry regulator Ofgem.

The reduction meant that typical 12-month bills will be around £500 cheaper than a year ago.

It left the average bill at £1,568 - a figure that will apply until the result of the next review takes effect in October.

However, a report by the Energy & Climate Intelligence Unit (ECIU) said on Monday that consumers should brace for an additional hit of up to £600 over the coming winter, largely due to higher wholesale prices.

It pointed to a possible £200 price cap hike from October on the back of some analyst calculations, suggesting it was plausible the total could remain around that level until June.

One calculation, by experts at Cornwall Insight and released on Friday, predicted a 10% - or £155 - increase from 1 October to £1,723 a year but said there remained uncertainty on the market path ahead.

Consumer groups say there is an alternative to the price cap, pointing to a growing number of fixed-rate deals on the market following a dearth of competition in recent years.

European wholesale costs are again elevated for the time of year based on pre-energy shock norms.

Recent pressures have included strong competition from Asia, particularly China, for liquefied natural gas (LNG).

That has replaced some of the Russian natural gas volumes that were stripped away in the wake of the invasion of Ukraine in February 2022.

A planned extension of the European Union's sanctions regime against Russia will see its LNG exports targeted for the first time - potentially placing further pressure on supply across the continent.

UK household costs for both gas and electricity stood at an average of just below £1,090 ahead of the Russia-Ukraine war.

The ECIU report said: ""By September 2025, the average household could have paid an extra £2,600 on energy bills during the ongoing gas crisis.

""With the government also spending £1,400 per home earlier in the crisis, the total extra costs could be £4,000 per home, and counting.""

Energy has been among the big battlegrounds of the election.

Please use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player 4:20 The price of going green? Unions say it's workers' jobs

Much of the debate has centred on costs but the impact of gas use in particular has fuelled argument too on the UK's climate commitments.

Dr Simon Cran-McGreehin, head of analysis at ECIU, said: ""The UK's high dependence on gas for electricity generation and heating has cost bill payers £2,000 so far during the gas crisis and the economy as a whole tens of billions of pounds.

""Common sense measures like investing in insulating the poorest homes, switching to electric heat pumps and fast-tracking British renewables will leave us less vulnerable to the whims of the international gas markets.

""North Sea gas output is declining so unless we make the switch we'll be ever more dependent on foreign imports.

""The maths is clear, when it comes to energy independence, new drilling licences are a side show making a marginal difference compared to the immense quantity of homegrown energy that offshore wind and other renewables can generate.""

Emily Seymour, the editor of Which? Energy, said: ""Consumers will be relieved to hear that the price cap is dropping by around £122 for the typical household from 1st July.""

She added: ""With the price cap predicted to rise again in October, many consumers will also be wondering whether to fix their energy deal.

""There's no 'one size fits all' approach but the first step is to compare your monthly payments on the price cap to any fixed deals to see what the best option is for you.

""As a rule of thumb, if you want to fix, we'd recommend looking for deals as close to the July price cap as possible, not longer than 12 months and without significant exit fees.""","As the latest reduction in the energy price cap takes effect, households are being warned of a big lift in bills ahead due to higher wholesale gas prices.

Skynews,https://news.sky.com/story/general-election-2024-five-things-the-main-parties-arent-talking-about-this-election-13160903,2024-07-01,00:01:00 UTC,General Election 2024: Five things the main parties aren't talking about this election,"The Institute for Fiscal Studies (IFS) says there's a conspiracy of silence at this election - that all of the major political parties aren't being honest enough about their fiscal plans.

And it has a point. Most obviously (and this is the main thing the IFS is complaining about) none of the major manifestos - from Labour, the Liberal Democrats and the Conservative parties - have been clear about how they will fill an impending black hole in the government's spending plans.

No need to go into all the gritty details, but the overarching point is that all government spending plans include some broad assumptions about how much spending (and for that matter, taxes and economic growth) will grow in the coming years. Economists call this the ""baseline"".

But there's a problem with this baseline - it assumes quite a slow increase in overall government spending in the next four years, an average of about 1 per cent a year after accounting for inflation. Which doesn't sound too bad - except that we all know from experience that NHS spending always grows more quickly than that, and that 1% needs to accommodate all sorts of other promises, like increasing schools and defence spending and so on.

Image: NHS spending grows more quickly than the 'baseline'

If all those bits of government are going to consume quite a lot of that extra money (far more than a 1% increase, certainly) then other bits of government won't get as much. In fact, the IFS reckons those other bits of government - from the Home Office to the legal system - will face annual cuts of 3.5 per cent. In other words, it's austerity all over again.

But here's the genius thing (for the politicians, at least). While they have to set a baseline, to make all their other sums add up, the dysfunctional nature of the way government sets its spending budgets means it only has to fill in the small print about which department gets what when it does a spending review. And that spending review isn't due until after the election.

The upshot is all the parties can pretend they've signed up to the baseline even when it's patently obvious that more money will be needed for those unprotected departments (or else it's a return to austerity).

So yes, the IFS is right: the numbers in each manifesto, including Labour's, are massively overshadowed by this other bigger conspiracy of silence.

But I would argue that actually the conspiracy of silence goes even deeper. Because it's not just fiscal baselines we're not talking about enough. Consider five other issues none of the major parties are confronting (when I say major parties, in this case I'm talking about the Conservative, Labour and Lib Dem manifestos - to some extent the Green and Reform manifestos are somewhat less guilty of these particular sins, even if they commit others).

Taxes going up

First, for all their promises not to raise any of the major tax rates (something Labour, the Conservatives and Lib Dems have all committed to) the reality is taxes are going up. We will all be paying more in taxes by the end of the parliament compared with today.

Indeed, we'll all be paying more income tax. Except that we'll be paying more of it because we'll be paying tax on more of our income - that's the inexorable logic of freezing the thresholds at which you start paying certain rates of tax (which is what this government has done - and none of the other parties say they'll reverse).

Second, the main parties might say they believe in different things, but they all seem to believe in one particular offbeat religion: the magic tax avoidance money tree. All three of these manifestos assume they will make enormous sums - more, actually, than from any single other money-raising measure - from tightening up tax avoidance rules.

While it's perfectly plausible that you could raise at least some money from clamping down on tax avoidance, it's hardly a slam-dunk. That this is the centrepiece of each party's money-raising efforts says a lot. And, another thing that's often glossed over: raising more money this way will also raise the tax burden.

Image: Should the Bank of England be paying large sums in interest to banks? File pic: AP

Third is another thing all the parties agree on and are desperate not to question: the fiscal rules. The government has a set of rules requiring it to keep borrowing and (more importantly given where the numbers are right now) total debt down to a certain level.

But here's the thing. These rules are not god-given. They are not necessarily even all that good. The debt rule is utterly gameable. It hasn't stopped the Conservatives from raising the national debt to the highest level in decades. And it's not altogether clear the particular measure of debt being used (net debt excluding Bank of England interventions) is even the right one.

Which raises another micro-conspiracy. Of all the parties at this election, the only one talking about whether the Bank of England should really be paying large sums in interest to banks as it winds up its quantitative easing programme is the Reform Party. This policy, first posited by a left-wing thinktank (the New Economics Foundation), is something many economists are discussing. It's something the Labour Party will quite plausibly carry out to raise some extra money if it gets elected. But no one wants to discuss it. Odd.

Brexit impact

Anyway, the fourth issue everyone seems to have agreed not to discuss is, you've guessed it, Brexit. While the 2019 election was all about Brexit, this one, by contrast, has barely featured the B word. Perhaps you're relieved. For a lot of people we've talked so much about Brexit over the past decade or so that, frankly, we need a bit of a break. That's certainly what the main parties seem to have concluded.

But while the impact of leaving the European Union is often overstated (no, it's not responsible for every one of our economic problems) it's far from irrelevant to our economic plight. And where we go with our economic neighbours is a non-trivial issue in the future.

Anyway, this brings us to the fifth and final thing no one is talking about. The fact that pretty much all the guff spouted on the campaign trail is completely dwarfed by bigger international issues they seem reluctant or ill-equipped to discuss. Take the example of China and electric cars.

Image: Brexit has barely featured in the election. File pic: Victoria Jones/PA

Just recently, both the US and European Union have announced large tariffs on the import of Chinese EVs. Now, in America's case those tariffs are primarily performative (the country imports only a tiny quantity of Chinese EVs). But in Europe's case, Chinese EVs are a very substantial part of the market - same for the UK.

Raising the question: what is the UK going to do? You could make a strong case for saying Britain should be emulating the EU and US, in an effort to protect the domestic car market. After all, failing to impose tariffs will mean this country will have a tidal wave of cars coming from China (especially since they can no longer go to the rest of the continent without facing tariffs) which will make it even harder for domestic carmakers to compete. And they're already struggling to compete.

By the same token, imposing tariffs will mean the cost of those cheap Chinese-made cars (think: MGs, most Teslas and all those newfangled BYDs and so on) will go up. A lot. Is this really the right moment to impose those extra costs on consumers?

In short, this is quite a big issue. Yet it hasn't come up as a big issue in this campaign - which is madness. But then you could say the same thing about, say, the broader race for minerals, about net zero policy more widely and about how we're going to go about tightening up sanctions on Russia to make them more effective.

Parochial election

Elections are always parochial but given the scale of these big, international issues (and there are many more), this one feels especially parochial.

So in short: yes, there have been lots of gaps. Enormous gaps. The ""conspiracy of silence"" goes way, way beyond the stuff the IFS has talked about.

But 'twas ever thus.

Think back to the last time a political party actually confronted some long-standing issues no one wanted to talk about in their manifesto. I'm talking about the 2017 Conservative manifesto, which pledged to resolve the mess of social care in this country, once and for all.

It sought to confront a big social issue, intergenerational inequality, in so doing ensuring younger people wouldn't have to subsidise the elderly.

The manifesto was an absolute, abject, electoral disaster. It was largely responsible for Theresa May's slide in the polls from a 20-point lead to a hung parliament.

And while most people don't talk about that manifesto anymore, make no mistake: today's political strategists won't forget it in a hurry. Hence why this year's campaign and this year's major manifestos are so thin.

But the next government cannot claim to be pro-growth without also being pro-green, Rain Newton-Smith, chief executive of the CBI, will tell a conference in London today.

With just three days to go until the general election, she will highlight the ""deafening silence from all the parties about the issues of climate change, biodiversity loss, net zero and our planet"".

But there is a risk in trying to ""separate the economy from net zero"", she will say, adding: ""Whoever forms the next government can't be pro-growth and deliver for our people, planet and communities, without being pro-green.""

In February, research by CBI economists found the 9% growth in the UK's net zero economy had far exceeded general GDP growth of around just 0.1% in the last year, indicating the need for a clear green plan to attract private investment.

The research suggested the next government could add as much as £57bn to the economy from green growth by 2030.

Green issues were high up the agenda during the last UK general election in 2019, after protests by Extinction Rebellion (XR), school strikes led by Greta Thunberg and a ban on fracking had all been making headlines.

But while last time parties were clamouring to come up with the biggest tree-planting pledge, this year it has been made a wedge issue, dividing the parties.

The Conservatives have vowed to take a more ""proportionate and pragmatic"" approach to climate action after some voters in the Uxbridge by-election appeared to reject Labour over the London mayor's ULEZ air pollution policy.

Labour have said they want to make the UK a ""clean energy superpower"", though they have also watered down some green plans.

In reality, many of the two parties' policies differ less than their rhetoric.

The CBI leader will call on both main parties to commit to delivering steps to achieving green growth.

""The next government has got to be loud and proud in making green growth part of a new investor pitch for Brand Britain,"" she will say.

""No more prevarication, no more rowed back commitments. Whoever forms the next government has to let the world know it's serious about the investment opportunities from net zero and that we're in this for the long haul. Make decisions and stick to them.""

She will add that businesses want the creation of an Office for Net Zero to co-ordinate action across government departments.

""It's a dangerous error to try and separate [the economy] from net zero.

""There is still too much in our political discourse that amounts to 'Can we afford to go for net zero?' But the real question is, can we afford not to?""

As well as the proposals of Labour and the Conservatives, the Lib Dems have pledged to ""put tackling climate change at the heart of a new industrial strategy"", and say investing in clean energy will lower emissions and high energy bills and create jobs.

The SNP in April ditched its greenhouse gas target, but still wants to make the Scotland a ""green energy powerhouse"", and pledges an ""evidence-based approach"" to new oil and gas projects. It wants more devolved powers over energy to ensure its natural resources better serve Scottish people.

The Green Party wants the UK to meet net zero more than a decade earlier than the current 2050 target, and has promised to spend £40bn a year to fund the shift to a green economy.

Sky News has learnt that Sebastian James is to become the new group chief executive of Veonet, which is owned by the private equity firm PAI Partners and Canada's Ontario Teachers Pension Plan.

He will leave Boots in November, as Sky News revealed on Saturday, and will join Veonet soon afterwards, insiders said.

Veonet was acquired by its current owners in early 2022 from Nordic Capital, another buyout firm.

In the UK, Veonet owns SpaMedica, which performs eye operations such as cataract removals for the NHS.

Overall, the group provides eye care services to more than 2m patients annually across five European markets, including Germany, the Netherlands and Spain.

Dr Markus Hamm, the current Veonet CEO, is retiring but will remain on its board.

Mr James is leaving Boots after its parent, Walgreens Boots Alliance, abandoned plans to sell or float the pharmacy chain for a second time in two years.

His departure will come during the retailer's 175th anniversary year.

An announcement about his exit from Boots and appointment at Veonet is expected to be made early this week.

The science of predicting the outcome of an election,"It is the first big moment of election night. The exit poll is the moment millions tune in for a first sniff of the eventual result of the general election.

And in Election 2024 this poll, with its impressive track record, sometimes down to a margin of only a few seats, will, once again, be a key part of broadcasters' coverage - including here at Sky News - on Thursday night.

The current model was devised in 2005 by Professor John Curtice and statistician David Firth and it has been consistently reliable, bar 2015 when the seat numbers suggested a hung parliament and David Cameron scraped a thin majority.

But for the most part, its accuracy has been dependable. In 2010, it correctly predicted the exact number of seats for the Conservatives.

Commissioned by the broadcasters - Sky News, the BBC and ITV News - the fieldwork is carried out by IPSOS UK who will have interviewers at 133 polling stations around the country this year.

People who have just voted will be asked to privately fill in a replica ballot paper and place it into a ballot box as they leave their local community centre, church hall or station.

Michael Clemence, from IPSOS UK, says this and the scale are part of what distinguishes the exit poll from the many surveys that have come before it.

""We're going to be doing over 17,000 interviews on the day. And also we're dealing with people's behaviour. So we're not asking people how they intend to vote.

""We're talking to electors who just voted. And I'm asking exactly what they just did. So you've cut out the error in prediction polling.""

Researchers can only deploy to a fraction of the total constituencies in England, Scotland and Wales, so locations are chosen to best reflect the demographics of the country with an urban and rural spread.

However, many of the locations will be in marginal seats, where the swing between the main parties will be tracked.

The same polling stations are targeted year after year so the swing from the last election's exit poll, along with other data at constituency level, can be analysed by those crunching the numbers.

The data collected at the polling stations is sent back by interviewers to IPSOS UK at several stages throughout the day.

It's processed there and sent via a secure data pipeline to the broadcasters' statisticians and political scientists who are locked down in a secret location in the capital.

Phones confiscated in 'the bunker'

""Our phones are taken away from us, there are security guards. So we don't communicate with the outside world at all, we just talk to each other. So it's a very strange feeling - as people are still going to the polls - already having a sense of what the result will be,"" says Professor Will Jennings.

The Sky News election analyst and political scientist will be one of those inside that sealed and secret room on election day - and the key thing experts will be looking at is that change in voter behaviour.

""We'll model the change in the vote at each of those polling stations, and we'll try and look for patterns in that change and also particular characteristics of constituencies that might predict change and might predict what we're seeing across the country,"" says Prof Jennings.

""We will throw a lot of different variables at the data during the day, whether it's the percentage of the local constituency that we think voted leave in the referendum, the number of people in working class jobs, the number of people who own a car, for example, it could be anything,"" adds Prof Jennings.

Skynews,https://news.sky.com/story/energy-supplier-ovo-to-explore-options-including-sale-13160749,2024-06-29,08:02:00 UTC,Energy supplier OVO to explore options including sale,"Britain's fourth-biggest household energy supplier is lining up bankers to explore options including bringing in a new investor or a sale, 15 years after it launched in a bid to challenge the industry's oligopoly.

Sky News has learnt that OVO Group, which was founded by Stephen Fitzpatrick, is close to hiring Rothschild to assist with a strategic review of the business.

City sources said this weekend that a range of possibilities would be considered during the process, which is expected to take several months.

Money blog: How to split housework fairly

These are likely to include a refinancing - with talks already underway about OVO's existing borrowings - as well as issuing new shares to prospective investors, or a partial or full sale by some of the company's shareholders.

An outright sale of the business is considered by insiders to be unlikely at this point, but is expected to be explored as part of the strategic review.

OVO, which has about four million customers, sits behind Centrica, the owner of British Gas, Octopus Energy and E.ON Next in the rankings of Britain's leading gas and electricity suppliers, according to market share data provided by Ofgem, the industry regulator.

Under Mr Fitzpatrick, who launched OVO in 2009, the company positioned itself as a challenger brand offering superior service to the industry's established players.

OVO's transformational moment came in 2020, when it bought the retail supply arm of SSE, transforming it overnight into one of Britain's leading energy companies.

Its growth has not been without difficulties, with insiders referring to a challenged relationship with Ofgem and a torrent of customer complaints about overcharging.

In recent months, OVO's shareholders have reshaped its leadership team, bringing in the former J Sainsbury chief executive Justin King as its chairman.

In May, Mr King recruited David Buttress, the former Just Eat boss who was briefly Boris Johnson's cost-of-living tsar, as the energy group's new chief executive.

Mr Buttress replaced Raman Bhatia, who left to join Starling Bank.

He is expected to focus on sharpening the company's customer service performance as well as exploring ways to further diversify its products and services.

Key to OVO's valuation will be the growth of its technology platform, Kaluza, which was set up to license its software to other energy suppliers, and provides customers with smart electric vehicle charging and heat pumps.

OVO recently announced that AGL Energy, one of Australia's biggest energy suppliers, had bought a 20% stake in Kaluza at a $500m (£395m) valuation.

Kaluza is understood to be exploring further expansion opportunities in Europe, Japan and the US.

OVO has also entered the electric vehicle car charging sector under the brand Charge Anywhere, adding 34,000 public charging points across the UK.

In 2022, OVO Group made an unadjusted loss of £1.3bn, which it blamed on a decline in the value of energy it had bought in advance to meet future supply commitments.

It said this had ""no cash impact"" in a corporate filing, and that this value would rise as customers used the energy it had bought.

Last summer, the company announced a £200m secondary share sale which saw existing investors Mayfair Equity Partners and Morgan Stanley Investment Management increasing their stakes in the company.

Other investors include Mitsubishi Corporation, the Japanese conglomerate.

Mayfair is thought to hold a stake of over 30%, while Mitsubishi owns approximately 20%.

Mr Fitzpatrick also remains a significant shareholder.

This weekend, it was unclear which of OVO's investors might seek a disposal of their interests, although insiders acknowledged that a sizeable proportion of the company's shares could end up changing hands.

Like its rivals, OVO has been contending with the impact of the industry price cap after a period of enormous price spikes which sent customers' bills soaring.

Last month, Ofgem said the cap would fall in the quarter from July to September by the annualised equivalent of £122, to £1568.

Other big players in the sector include EDF and Scottish Power, which is owned by Spain's Iberdrola.

In recent months, Octopus Energy, run by Greg Jackson, has crystallised a valuation of over £7bn by selling stakes to a number of new investors.

Centrica has a market valuation on the London Stock Exchange of £7.3bn.

Sky News has learnt that Sebastian James, who has run Boots since 2018, will leave the company in November.

City sources said this weekend that he had accepted a new role in the healthcare industry.

Money blog: How to split housework fairly

His exit comes soon after it emerged that New York-listed Walgreens Boots Alliance (WBA), the British retailer's owner, had decided for the second time in two years against pursuing a sale or stock market flotation of the chain.

An announcement about Mr James's departure is expected in the coming days.

WBA is not yet thought to have lined up a successor.

Mr James, who previously ran the electricals retailer Dixons (now named Currys), recently endorsed Sir Keir Starmer - a notable move because of his long friendship with Lord Cameron, the foreign secretary.

His departure from Boots will come during the Nottingham-based company's 175th year.

Boots employs about 52,000 people and trades from roughly 1,900 stores.

Its recent trading performance has been strong, with WBA this week saying that like-for-like sales at Boots during the quarter to the end of May rose by 6% and 5.8% across its retail and pharmacy operations respectively.

An insider said Mr James had overseen a successful turnaround, with market share having grown for 13 successive quarters.

During a previous auction in 2022, only one bidder - a consortium of Apollo Global Management and Reliance Industries - tabled a formal offer worth about £5.5bn.

However, growing concerns about the global economy had triggered severe doubts among large banks which help finance leveraged buyouts, with Boots among the biggest such deals in Europe.

Among the other challenges facing prospective acquirers at the time was finding an adequate solution for Boots' £8bn pension scheme - one of the largest private retirement funds in the UK.

This issue has now been resolved through an insurance deal struck with Legal & General.

Like many retailers, Boots had a turbulent pandemic, announcing 4,000 job cuts in 2020 as a consequence of a restructuring of its Nottingham head office and store management teams.

Shortly before the COVID pandemic, Boots earmarked about 200 of its UK stores for closure, a reflection of changing shopping habits.

Boots' heritage dates back to John Boot opening a herbal remedies store in Nottingham in 1849.

It opened its 1000th UK store in 1933.

In 2006, Boots merged with Alliance Unichem, a drug wholesaler, with the buyout firm KKR acquiring the combined group in an £11bn deal the following year.

Investment Thesis

Yum China (NYSE:YUMC) is a good business with a stable competitive advantage in the Chinese dinning market. The majority of its earnings are from KFC and Pizza Hut. Growth has been strong as it has been capturing opportunities across cities in China. Differently right now, the majority of these growth opportunities come from what are considered ""lower-tier"" cities. The scale of such is significant and large enough to support its current high-growth trajectory.

Out-of-context with respect to the overall market, its intrinsic valuation is attractive with an estimated upside of 18.5%. However, considering the recent poor stock performance, the dominating forces seem to be the broader market risks and due to momentum. This is why now is not the best time to enter as it may forfeit the opportunity for even better price to purchase a fundamentally strong and non-cyclical business.

Stock Overview

YUMC performance relative to benchmark and peers (Seeking Alpha)

Yum China has suffered from a declining trend since mid-2023, with a 1-year price return of -44% and -25% year-to-date. This is despite its outperformance against consensus EPS in fiscal years 2023 (EPS of $2 vs $1.92) and $0.72 vs $0.65 in FY24 Q1. Its valuation is cheap for what appears to be a high growth business (12.2% YoY revenue growth).

Peer Valuations

Seeking Alpha, Author's Calculation

Tickers: YUMC, MCD, YUM, CMG, DPZ, SBUX

The peers were selected based on the fact that these are all businesses with ""Moats"" and comparable growth. They all have strong branding, a proven way of doing business, and track records of expanding consistently. (Check out: brands of YUMC)

More about Yum China itself. Since 2016, YUMC was spun-off from Yum Brands to exclusively focus on the China market. Back then, it operated around 7,500 stores with $6.7 billion in revenue and covering 1,100 cities. By the end of FY 2023, YUM had around 15,000 stores with $11 billion in revenue and covering over 2,000 cities. In that fiscal year, it opened 1,697 new stores with half of them in ""lower-tier"" cities (below tiers 1 and 2). This brings us to Yum's current strategy to capture the massive consumption potential in lower-tier cities of China. With 15,000 stores in FY24 Q1, the company plans to bring that number to 20,000 by the end of FY26.

From the growth mandate, the pace of expected growth consensus is in-line with historical trajectory. The current share price of $31 and the well-below-peer forward price multiple is either a opportunistic mis-pricing, skepticism expressed in Yum China's expansion trajectory, or poor risk sentiment in the overall market. I will discuss my stance on the stock by firstly looking at Yum's growth capacity, then the implications of valuation, and lastly the opportunities.

Question: How Large Exactly Can YUMC Grow?

As we've seen, YUMC has been growing at an extraordinary pace since 2016 and way before that since it entered China. The first store of KFC was back in 1987, Beijing. Back then, China had a GDP per capita of less than $1,000 USD PPP vs. $22,500 in 2022. The reason I'm bring this up is because when Yum entered China back in the days, China's extent of development and spending level were very low. As the living standard and consumption evolved positively overtime, Yum was able to capture the opportunity in this massive market. As of today, Yum's growth mandate continues. But instead of capturing growth from tier-1 cities such as Beijing and Shanghai, their strategic mandate (FY23 10k; see RGM section) is to focus on lower tier cities where growth opportunities are strong and much untapped.

Morgan Stanley, 2017

These are cities that represent 70% of the Chinese population, and where the current penetration rates of fast food chains are low. In a study done back in 2018, lower-tier city consumption was expected to rise from $2.3 trillion to $6.9 trillion in 2030, 9% CAGR growth. This coincides with the growth the Chinese middle-class, a continuing driver to unlock the potential of the 70% population.

Lets look more closely into the implications of growth. As mentioned, in 2023, more than half of the additional 1,700 stores come from ""lower-tier"" cities. Suppose we assume the same mix of additional stores and estimate the per-capita consumption using existing stores/cities, the following is my rough estimate of growth and the growth potential under the current pace of expansion.

Estimate of potential sales growth (UBS, Yum China, author's Calculation)

As we see from the estimate, the sole contribution from expanding into the lower-tier cities for Yum can be significant and sustainable. With the current market consensus, YUMC's revenue and EPS growth will be around the 10% level for the years ahead. It can well sustained by the scale of the Chinese market and the unexploited opportunities that it currently offers in addition to the higher tier cities that it operates in. Please note that my calculations are meant to be a reference, not implying YUMC's growth trajectory. The actual result will depend on factors ranging from the effectiveness of management's strategic execution to the variability from sales given demand and foreign exchange effects. However, I do hope that it gives you more context on the current consensus. Overall, I don't think skepticism of growth is material based the solid performance of FY23 where lower-tier expansion is a major growth driver. Also, YUM's historical record of growing in the underdeveloped China serves a similar narrative in expanding its footstep in the developing cities. Next, I will move on to valuation.

Valuation Analysis: Dividend Discount Approach

Before getting down to the numbers, I want to explain the discrepancies between consensus EPS and revenue growth where EPS growth generally seems higher. Along with Yum's expansion plan comes a $3 billion repurchase/dividend plan within 2024-2026. In FY24 Q1, it paid $0.16/share dividend, a 23% hike from last year's $0.13/share dividend. Common stock repurchases also reached $680 million vs. $60 million in FY23 Q1. In total, around $750 million were returned to shareholders as of now in the fiscal year of 2024. The commitment potentially implicates 1) management is bullish on performance and taking advantage of the current cheap valuation 2) consistent dividend policy which better justifies the use case for my dividend discount model. I am conservative with the model given that with YUMC, we are dealing with long-term speculation of growth, which is a very difficult to forecast. Here are some of the highlights of assumptions:

A cost of equity of 8.2% is used. Beta (~0.87) is estimated in the recent 1-year period where covariance of return between YUMC and SP500 is fairly stable, and so is the broader market volatility. 4.2% risk-free rate is used based on 10-year treasuries. 4.8% US market risk-premium as per the estimate by Professor Damodaran. I used earnings consensus in the next 4.5 years and a payout ratio of 30%, which is fairly representative of the amount of dividend given the return-cash-to-shareholder program. To compute the terminal value, I used the h-model with the following parameters (half-time = 7 years (14 years of declining growth), high growth rate = 10%, terminal low growth rate = 5%). I believe this is reflective of the nature of Yum's growth trajectory expanding its market coverage at a slowing pace as it consolidates.

Results and Limitations

Seeking Alpha, Yum China, author's calculation

Overall, my target price based on the DDM model is $37.1 per share. It implies an upside of 18.5% and a forward P/E ratio of 17 vs. the current ~15. The valuation is based on short-term market estimates supported by the strategic narrative of Yum's management, and the estimate of long-term growth potential. Based on historical data, the consensuses are generally conservative with the exception of negative earnings surprise in FY21 and FY22 due to Covid-19 in China. In the next section, I will discuss some of the key risks. To me, the implications of some of these risks are quite profound.

Investment Risks

Foreign Exchange: The Chinese Yuan is currently on a devaluating (CNY:USD) trend against the USD given its easing environment. Please note the significance this. Looking at FY24 Q1, a source of revenue underperformance is the effect of FX where revenue growth YoY is 1%, but excluding FX effect is 7%.

Growth: Although so far with the robust results of lower-tier expansion based FY23 performance, new target cities are heterogenous and how popular the product will be is uncertain.

China's Macro factors: This has more to do with foreign exchange risks given the pace of easing. From a product demand side, Yum's product should be fairly resilient against macro factors given its affordable and unique nature. I think most people would consume fried chicken at a fairly consistent frequency regardless of say what the home prices are tomorrow.

China's Micro factors: Market competition in the Chinese restaurant market is strong. Although brands such as KFC and Pizza Hut have strong track records with significant competitive advantages, some of the emerging brands such as Lavazza in Yum China's portfolio are still being tested with negative earnings. Although they represent less than 8% of revenue (FY 23), their success does have an implication on future growth. A future that can potentially bring lots of success.

Overall Momentum and market factors : YUM China's Stock is performing poorly as mentioned. Based on the S&P breadth level, the downward trend is not only for YUMC but also for entire market (could be macro or political factors). I encourage you to monitor this strongly. I also think this factor prevails against all others.

Seeking Alpha

Conclusion

Overall, Yum China is a good business. It has a proven model and trajectory in the Chinese market. Its future growth potential on an industry level is significant. This is why it is expected by myself and the wider consensus that the elevated growth rate will continue.

My current price target is $37.1 with an upside of 18.5%. Although this is decent valuation, I do not recommend purchasing this stock. I suggest we use this as a reference and come back when the broader market risks stabilize. The sources of these risks could be from what's going on within the US and China. Firstly, the Yuan devaluation is likely to prevail as the rate cut pace in the US is uncertain and unsettling for some. We also see the current falling breadth of the S&P which may be a result of election/policy and macroeconomic uncertainties within the US.

In the shorter-term, the market sentiment and risk appetite is certainly what prevails especially for a stock where all its exposure is in China, a seemingly uncertain environment. It is beneficial to monitor the decline to potentially capture a better price for what I believe is a great business.","Its valuation is cheap for what appears to be a high growth business (12.2% YoY revenue growth).

Dear subscribers,

A few months ago, I covered Pernod Ricard (OTCPK:PRNDY) - and I mean to do so again. You can find that article here. A few subscribers asked me whether the company was worth purchasing here - it has, after all, dropped more, and the current expectation is for Pernod Ricard to have a rather headwind-heavy 2024E. This has mistakenly (as I see it) resulted in a situation where the company is now trading at less than €131/share for the native, which means we're at a high yield and a low P/E of the company - despite the overall quality that we have when it comes to this business.

My investments in European companies at low valuations typically yield their dividends both in the form of dividend payments, but also in terms of capital appreciation. Most of my high-conviction plays over the past 2 years have gone fairly well - though there are some that have not yet reached their designated targets or levels, and I continue to put money to work in these businesses.

Pernod Ricard is one of those businesses, and in this article, I mean to show you why I am buying more.

Pernod Ricard - I believe The upside will materialize, and there is an over 80% upside here until 2026E.

So, Pernod Ricard. You've probably followed my work on the company if you're interested in an update on that thesis. Pernod hasn't been undervalued to this degree in more than 8 years.

that Pernod hasn't been undervalued to this degree in more than 8 years. This may seem hard to believe at this point and given how much the company has dropped in the last year - but there it is. The company does not often move below 18.5x P/E - and we're not at a valuation of around 17.2x. My cost basis is around 17.6x normalized P/E, or below €150/share for the native ticker RI, on the French/Parisian stock market.

The namesake spirit of the company is only one of the company's spirits and beverages. While this is certainly a recommended one to try if you drink alcohol ( The spirit/liqueur is an anise-flavored drink, meaning it takes a bit like licorice. It has a flavor ""cousin"" in the green drink, absinthe. ) the overall upside is based on more than just Pernod.

This is a company selling €12B worth of products in a single year, yet it is at this time at a market cap of €33B - meaning that it's now at less than 0.4x to revenue in terms of sales. The company also has an extremely low debt of 37% long-term debt/capital, and a BBB+ credit rating. The company's yield isn't massive - it's not a high-yield business - but at almost 3.6%, it's one of the best in yields in the entire segment. Better than Diageo (DEO) and better than LVMH (OTCPK:LVMUY).

Pernod does the European thing - meaning it provides only full updates twice a year, and otherwise, it provides mostly trading updates. We have 3Q23 results as of late April 2024.

For 3Q24, the company reports robust performance. Robust performance in this context means an organic net sales decline of 2% - and this is despite the ongoing trouble in China. The company has growth markets and it has its ""must-win"" markets - markets like India, Japan, Germany, Turkey, Spain, Brazil, France, and so on. Growth markets are places like China.

China remains in a difficult macroeconomic environment due to overall political challenges.

Pernod Ricard IR (Pernod Ricard IR)

Excluding the company's problematic markets like Russia, the company actually grew in terms of sales, and almost managed flat 9M24 sales for 3Q23. As for volumes, these actually grew during the quarter, which means that the company actually managed to continue growth after almost four consecutive quarters of decline.

Asia in particular saw a nice rebound in sales - 8% growth, with the exception of China, with strong growth in India (strong demand for spirits, accelerating sales, higher premiumization, and the like). If we look at China alone, that one is declining 9% due to weak FX and softening consumer sentiment.

The best result though, was in Global Travel Retail, which was up 38%. Improved sell-out momentum amplified by phasing as well as overall favorable comps.

The company was able, as a result of this quarter, to estimate the FY24 results. Since we've already seen the 9M trends, the company communicates with a high degree of confidence a long-term growth - including for this year, of around 4-7% top line, with an organic operating leverage of 50-60 bps.

It is a challenging current environment, but despite this the company expects stable development, with continuing strong cost control, and slight growth in organic margin - and some slight negative FX.

In total, Pernod also expects €300M worth of share buybacks for the year - with half of that already completed. This, I believe, together with an EPS forecast of at least €8/share adjusted, means that there is a massive overall upside for this company going forward.

Pernod Ricard IR (Pernod Ricard IR)

There's a significant normalization in the overall spirits market currently ongoing, with a decline in organic sales, organic PRO, and the end of the so-called post-COVID-19 ""supercycle"". The declining sales do not mean that the company is doing badly, nor that it won't go up again - it just means that the company is currently in a slight slump.

Before the 3Q24, I expected above €8/share in EPS. The development and forecasts now mean that the upside I've forecasted for Pernod is perhaps in 2025-2026 at this time, with current 2026E forecasts over €9/share. This year is likely to stay below €9/share.

However, I believe the market is focusing too much on the company's challenges and is missing the longer-term upside and reversal potential, and what such a reversal would mean even at a low premiumization, which I think this company is easily ""worth"". The same trends we see in other spirits companies are driving the upside. By this, I mean that the premium portion of the portfolio is driving sales. Also, remember that Pernod is on the tail end of two years of superb growth, with a CAGR of 4% in America, 7% in Europe, and 11% in Asia, all between 2020 and 2024. So that we might see a bit of a slump or downside here is not all that strange.

Even with rationalization, I believe Pernod Ricard to be worth far more than the market says it is here, and I consider the relevant valuation to be as follows.

Pernod Ricard - The upside is now significant

So - valuation remains one of the core questions here - and this is getting better and better as the price drops and the valuation upside improves. As things stand now, just below €131 for the native ticker, the company is massively attractive. At less than 16.5x normalized P/E, is cheaper than it has been for many years.

While I do acknowledge that the drop in earnings, and the current macro and trouble in growth segments should be reflected in valuation, I believe this is a massive overreaction. The company has an average EPS growth rate of 7%, which together with the BBB+ credit and the low debt to me makes it worth at least 20-24x. At the very low point of that spectrum, just below 20x, we still find a 20% annualized upside here.

F.A.S.T graphs Pernod Upside (F.A.S.T graphs Pernod Upside)

If we ratchet this 20-year average up to a 5-year average, we almost double that upside at over 80% 3-year estimated RoR. Even at a 15x-16x P/E, which I would consider an impaired valuation, we see an RoR of 8% per year inclusive of the 3.6% yield. (Paywalled F.A.S.T graphs link)

So, in every scenario I consider feasible based on the valuation, the company has significant downside protection and a good upside. This is exactly the sort of investment that I look for in my work, and what I personally invest in.

My typical allocation to a company like this during a valuation like this comes to 1-1.5%, no more than that - and that means I still have room to purchase more shares here.

I believe analysts are greatly underestimating the upside that this company has. There are risks - macro and the company's growth segments could impair the company's business for a few years. The greatest risk to the company is cyclicality, and this is a more cyclical luxury business than LVMH. But there's an over-focus on these near-term geopolitical risks which ignores this upside.

Current analyst targets, aside from my own, are between €133 as a low target, down from a high of €167 about a year ago, and a high of €210, down from about €268 from a year ago. This comes to an average of €164, down from around €220/share from a year ago, which means an upside of about 26% from today's share price. That means that regardless of how you consider the company, there's a non-trivial upside. 9 out of 20 analysts have the company at a ""BUY"", the rest are at a ""HOLD"" (Paywalled TIKR.com link).

Catalysts for an eventual upside include the company's attractive aged spirits segment, with further investment in production capacity.

Pernod Ricard IR (Pernod Ricard IR)

This together with the substantial size of the company's portfolio and continued gross margin improvement (as we saw in 1H24) is part of my positive case for Pernod Ricard.

Here is my thesis for Pernod Ricard as of 2024.

Thesis

Pernod Ricard is one of the more interesting luxury vintners and distillers out there. The company owns a portfolio of one of the most market-beating companies and brands out there, giving it a great moat and making it very investable at the ""right"" sort of overall price. The company has been overvalued or at least fully valued for some time.

However, at below €140/share, it no longer is overvalued, and I've significantly been adding shares to my portfolio, I am now over 0.6% in both my private and my commercial portfolio-

I believe Pernod Ricard, based on a growth estimate of 6-9% for the next few years (down from double digits, and with a difficult 2024E), still has the potential to outperform the market at 13-20% per year, and this means that it qualifies as a conservatively-adjusted market-outperforming company as far as my approach is concerned. I rate it a ""BUY"" with a €190/share long-term share price, at minimum. I'm not changing this target at this time.

Remember, I'm all about:

1. Buying undervalued - even if that undervaluation is slight, and not mind-numbingly massive - companies at a discount, allowing them to normalize over time and harvesting capital gains and dividends in the meantime.

2. If the company goes well beyond normalization and goes into overvaluation, I harvest gains and rotate my position into other undervalued stocks, repeating #1.

3. If the company doesn't go into overvaluation, but hovers within a fair value, or goes back down to undervaluation, I buy more as time allows.

4. I reinvest proceeds from dividends, savings from work, or other cash inflows as specified in #1.

Here are my criteria and how the company fulfills them (italicized).

This company is overall qualitative.

This company is fundamentally safe/conservative & well-run.

This company pays a well-covered dividend.

This company is currently cheap.

This company has a realistic upside based on earnings growth or multiple expansion/reversion.

I went back and forth on calling this company ""cheap"" here, but I do in fact believe that it is ""cheap"" at sub-€150/share. This means that the company fulfills every single one of my criteria, making it relatively clear why I view it as a ""BUY"" here.

Thank you for reading.

The bull market continues higher heading into Q2 2024 earnings, led by most of the Magnificent Seven. The S&P 500 Trust (SPY) has appreciated by 15.14% YTD, and only 2 of the Magnificent Seven are trailing the market. Apple (AAPL) is just slightly behind as it's up 13.46% on the year, while Tesla (TSLA) is the only company whose stock price has declined from the Magnificent Seven in 2024. I have heard for years that the appreciation from these companies isn't sustainable, but they continue to prove the bears wrong. Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL) experienced some adversity in the beginning of the year as the Gemini incident caused financial outlets such as The Economist, and prominent investors such as Brad Gerstner from Altimeter Capital to discuss what the ramifications could mean for them. I remained very bullish as the incident was a fixable problem, and I didn't believe advertising would be impacted or that customers would switch their cloud provider and phone operating system. GOOGL has proven the bears wrong and the bulls right, as it's now up 31.83% in 2024 and climbed 38.62% since reaching $131.40 on March 6th, 2024. Regardless of how GOOGL has performed YTD or the fact its stock price is making all-time highs, I believe GOOGL is headed higher as there is a significant amount of revenue and earnings growth on the horizon. While the market could see some retracements in the future and a recession is inevitable sometime in the future, the largest companies keep getting larger, and I think the bull case for GOOGL is far from over.

Following up on my previous article about Alphabet

While GOOGL expanded on its financial dominance in Q1 after beating the consensus estimates by $1.84 billion for expected revenue and $0.38 on GAAP EPS, I decided to wait prior to releasing another update. I wanted to see how the Gemini situation would play out as I had outlined my thoughts about the matter in my recent article which was published on March 6th, 2024 (can be read here). Since then, shares of GOOGL have appreciated by 36.83%, and after paying their first quarterly dividend on June 17th, their total return was 36.99%. This outpaced the S&P 500 by a significant amount, as the index is up 6.9% during this period. As I predicted, the Gemini debacle wouldn't be GOOGL's destruction, and shares are now making all-time highs. I discussed my bull case when shares of GOOGL were hitting a rough patch, and I am still very bullish on GOOGL at all-time highs. I think there is still a massive opportunity for long-term investors, and while shares could cool off at some point, I believe shares will finish significantly higher at the end of 2024 than they are today.

Risks to investing in Alphabet

No matter how much revenue a company generates or how profitable it has become, there are always risks to investing. Alphabet has enjoyed a duopoly with Meta Platforms (META) as these have been the 2 companies that have dominated the advertising space. Recently, Amazon (AMZN) became a third option as they generated $11.82 billion in advertising sales during Q1 2024, which was a 24% YoY increase. If AAPL gets into the sector and AMZN continues to grow its advertising revenue, the sector could become more diversified, and GOOGL could see its advertising revenue decline, which would impact future revenue and earnings projections. GOOGL could also see less revenue generated from YouTube as product offerings from other streaming services become more enticing. GOOGL could also see a slowdown in Google Cloud as AWS and Azure continue to expand their product offerings. It's not impossible for GOOGL to face declining revenues as they are operating in sectors where the largest companies are trying to take revenue from their top-line.

Alphabet is reaching all-time highs for good reasons as it's one of the best companies in the market

Despite how large GOOGL has become, it continues to find ways to innovate and grow. Over the past 4 years, GOOGL has increased its Q1 revenue by 95.68% as its grown from $41.16 billion in Q1 2020 to $80.54 billion in Q1 2024. When you're a small company, it's easy to grow at double-digit rates, but when you're as large as GOOGL, it's even more impressive to maintain double-digit growth rates on an annualized basis. In Q1 2024, GOOGL's revenue grew by 15.41% YoY, adding $10.75 billion in quarterly revenue compared to Q1 in 2023. The growth for GOOGL continues to be massive, and while there has been a secular dip in revenue from Q4 to Q1 due to holiday spending, the overall revenue trend continues to be up and to the right.

Steven Fiorillo, Alphabet

It took GOOGL more than 15 years to reach the $100 billion level of annualized revenue, and over the past 6 fiscal years, they have gone from $110.86 billion to $307.39 billion. So many people were worried about Search taking a hit, but Chat GPT and GOOGL Gemini haven't cannibalized its revenue-generating ability in the slightest bit. I broke out each segment individually in the charts below because I wanted to emphasize the individual growth these segments have accomplished. While Search continues to provide GOOGL with a revenue foundation and growth, YouTube Ads, Google Subscriptions, and Google Cloud are providing strong growth engines to the underlying metrics. Viewers are consuming more than 1 billion hours of YouTube content daily while surpassing 100 million music and premium subscribers. YouTube ads increased by 21% YoY, and YouTube has paid out more than $70 billion to content creators over the past 3 years. GOOGL has announced more than 1,000 new features over the past year within its Google Cloud infrastructure. GOOGL is offering its cloud clients access to a mixture of GPUs from NVIDIA Corporation (NVDA) in addition to their own TPUs. GOOGL is estimating that 60% of funded generative AI startups and 90% of generative AI unicorns are GOOGL Cloud customers. The subscription business continues to be led by YouTube subscription revenue as YouTube bleeds over into two segments.

Google Cloud continues to expand at a quick pace. In 2020 Google Cloud generated $13.06 billion in revenue, and over the next 4 years, its revenue increased by 169.61% as it grew to $35.21 billion in the trailing twelve months (TTM). Since 2020 Google Cloud has grown into GOOGL's 3rd largest revenue generator as it surpassed YouTube ad revenue and slightly trails the subscriptions, platforms, and devices segment. Between YouTube ads and Google Cloud, they have added $68.12 billion to the top line, and management believes that they will generate over $100 billion in revenue from all of YouTube's components and Google Cloud in 2024. It's hard for me to get bearish on GOOGL's future or consider exiting my position when double-digit growth rates have been maintained on an annualized basis, and the largest segments of the business continue to expand.

Steven Fiorillo, Alphabet

It's not just the top line that's growing at GOOGL, its profitability continues to increase. In GOOGL's Q1 of 2024, they generated $25.47 billion in operating income, which was an increase of 46.27% ($8.06 billion) YoY. This was an operating margin of 31.63% compared to 24.96% In Q1 of 2023. GOOGL was able to grow its profitability while becoming more efficient and increasing its operating margin by 6.67% YoY. GOOGL was able to grow its net income by 57.21% YoY in Q1 to $23.66 billion while growing its EPS by $0.73 to $1.91, which was an increase of 61.86%. I believe this is more impressive than the revenue growth because GOOGL isn't being irresponsible in growing its top-line as its profitability increases and margins expand. As profitability expands, GOOGL is able to invest more in its business, and this has fueled its growth cycle over decades, not years. There were 13 weeks in Q1, and GOOGL generated $1.82 billion in net income per week. It's extremely difficult for startups or even established competitors to compete with GOOGL when they are generating close to $2 billion in profitability on a weekly basis. GOOGL has $24.49 billion in cash and another $83.6 billion in short-term investments on its balance sheet, which places their on-hand liquidity at $108.09 billion. GOOGL has another $33.99 billion in long-term investments on the books, with only $11.87 billion in long-term debt. I think GOOGL's reign at the top of the mountain will continue for years to come, and I believe that its revenue growth combined with it's profitability makes it one of the best companies to invest in.

Shares of Alphabet look inexpensive and I would buy more at all-time highs

Some investors don't like buying at all-time highs, but I believe in the theory of time in the market rather than trying to time the market. I can't time tops and bottoms and make my investment decisions based on my forward investment thesis. I can't tell you how many people freaked out in March of 2020 because the S&P 500 went from being at 3,380 on 2/14/20 to 2,304.92 on 3/20/20. By the middle of August, the market had made new all-time highs and had pushed forward through 2021. Even if I look at the bear market in 2022, it may have taken a bit longer, but the S&P 500 has ultimately made new highs. Shares of GOOGL could certainly retrace, and it's possible that they miss earnings at some point, but I believe they will continue to increase over the long-term and short-term fluctuations that are part of investing in equities. The Board approved an additional $70 billion in repurchases while declaring its first cash dividend of $0.20. GOOGL is enhancing its capital allocation program, and the additional allocation toward buybacks should provide a boost to EPS in the future.

When I make investments into companies like GOOGL at all-time highs, I want to see that there is a patch for continuous top and bottom-line growth. GOOGL is expected to produce $1.84 of EPS in Q2 2024, which is a 27.5% increase YoY. When I look at the forward revenue growth GOOGL is expected to grow its top-line by 12.76% YoY in 2024, then by 11.04% in 2025, and by another 10.6% in 2026. I am invested in all the Magnificent Seven companies except for Microsoft, and I have been adding to these positions with the market at all-time highs. I believe that technology will continue to carry the market higher over the next several years, and when I compare all these companies to each other from a forward earnings perspective, GOOGL looks inexpensive.

When anyone makes an investment, they are buying equity in a company that represents all of the future growth on the top and bottom line, which will be achieved until they exit the position. GOOGL is expected to generate $7.54 in EPS for its 2024 fiscal year and grow its EPS by 30.24% over the next 2 years through 2026. On a forward earnings basis, GOOGL trades at the cheapest valuation in the Magnificent Seven based on 2024, 2025, and 2026 earnings. Even at all-time highs, investors are still paying 24.16 times 2024 earnings and 18.55 times 2026 earnings. The Magnificent Seven trade at an average 2024 forward P/E of 40.73 and 27.59 based on 2026 earnings. GOOGL is trading significantly below the peer group average, while it has more projected growth than Meta Platforms (META) or Apple (AAPL). I have also added Walmart (WMT), Home Depot (HD), and The Coca-Cola Company (KO) to my comparison to indicate just how inexpensive GOOGL is. KO is trading at 19.46 times 2026 earnings with 15.96% forward EPS growth expected from the end of 2024 through 2026. GOOGL is trading at a lower forward valuation based on 2026 earnings than KO, with almost double the projected growth. I believe that GOOGL is still the most undervalued company in the Magnificent Seven.

Conclusion

Earnings season is around the corner, and the Magnificent Seven is expected to start reporting on 7/19 as TSLA will get things started off. The market has continued higher through 2024, and GOOGL continues to make new all-time highs as its appreciated by 31.83% YTD. If you're a long-term investor, I think GOOGL looks inexpensive as it's top-line is expected to grow at double-digit percentages YoY for at least the next 3 years. GOOGL is also expected to grow its EPS by over 30% from the end of 2024 through 2026. GOOGL trades at less than 19 times 2026 earnings, and the Board just authorized an additional $70 billion in buybacks. I plan on adding to my position heading into earnings as I feel GOOGL is the most undervalued Magnificent Seven company in the market today. It's hard to bet against GOOGL as it generated more than $1.8 billion in net income per week in Q1 and has more than $100 billion in cash on hand.","400tmaxThe bull market continues higher heading into Q2 2024 earnings, led by most of the Magnificent Seven.

Amphastar Pharmaceuticals (NASDAQ:AMPH) (the ""Company"") - a $2bn market cap company which is up ~100% over the last three years - appears to be firing on all cylinders. We believe that investors and the sellside community are asleep at the wheel - extrapolating the Company's recent success into the future without realizing that much of Amphastar's growth has come off the back of unsustainable and temporary competitive factors. Simply put, our research has uncovered obvious competitive threats up and down Amphastar's product portfolio with the largest risks concentrated in some of their highest gross margin products, amplifying the financial implications of our research.

Black Mamba sees ~50%+ downside risk in the share price as Amphastar will be unable to meet the Street's lofty expectations, in our opinion. Our base case estimate of 2025 EBITDA is $208mm, compared to Visible Alpha sellside consensus of ~$351mm. The following report outlines our findings and opinions based entirely on publicly available information sourced through rigorous scouring of SEC disclosures, international financial reports, and various internet resources.

Our multipronged thesis is based on the following tenets:

Glucagon Amphastar's glucagon growth has been buoyed by underappreciated product shortages at sole competitor Fresenius KABI. Fresenius' supply issues were resolved in February 2024 . Fresenius' vial product seems to have structural advantages over Amphastar's kit-based product in the diagnostic market, which currently makes up two-thirds of Amphastar's glucagon sales and has driven most of the growth in Amphastar's glucagon business Planned glucagon product launches by Viatris (2024E), Lupin (2025E), and Meitheal Pharmaceuticals appear poised to turn this duopoly market into a five-player market Expensive and transformational Baqsimi purchase from Eli Lilly contains financial terms that siphon the vast majority of near-term profits from the product away from Amphastar

Pfizer (PFE) Tornado Beneficiary Products Amphastar's current earnings base is materially elevated by a tornado that hit a Pfizer facility . As a result, Amphastar has a temporary monopoly on multiple generic drugs . Amphastar does not disclose the revenue contribution from many of these products individually, making it hard for analysts to quantify how material the benefit has been to the business. Recent data suggests Pfizer will return to market with most of these products over the next several months Capital improvements (such as a new injectables manufacturing line) to Pfizer's facility are likely to reduce future benefits from temporary shortages

Epinephrine Amphastar's epinephrine revenue has benefited from multi-year long Pfizer production problems that were resolved immediately prior to the tornado (but then subsequently disrupted by the tornado). Pfizer appears primed to return to the market with their epinephrine product in late 2024 BPI Labs launched a competitor multi-dose vial in March 2024 . Prior to this, Amphastar only had one competitor in this product line. Amneal expects to launch multiple epinephrine products - including a prefilled syringe - in 2025 which will further competition in this category Gland Pharma - which has closely followed Amphastar in previous products - is potentially targeting an epinephrine multi-dose vial launch

Primatene MIST Key patent expiration in January 2026 invites private label competition , which could materially reduce revenue and profits from this cash cow product. Sellside forecasts assume that the current level of revenue is sustainable essentially into perpetuity Now that Amphastar has completed their distribution rollout of Primatene, organic volume trends appear to have little room for further growth during the remainder of Amphastar's patent exclusivity



Unapproved Generic Pipeline Consistent history of over-promising and under-delivering on recent pipeline opportunities Beaten to the punch on generic Forteo (teriparatide) by two juggernaut competitors - Teva and Apotex Undisclosed pipeline product AMP-018 is likely Victoza (liraglutide) in our opinion. Teva launched the first liraglutide generic this month, and other large competitors may soon follow



1. Glucagon

Within the US glucagon injection market, Amphastar is currently operating in an effective duopoly with Fresenius KABI as the other participant. Amphastar gained share in this market rapidly, and we expect the company to cede share in short order.

Glucagon has two primary markets: retail, in which diabetics carry glucagon emergency kits to counter severe hypoglycemia, and diagnostic, where glucagon is injected into a patient as a diagnostic aid for imaging the GI tract. Traditionally, the retail market has been dominated by kits (which are needed to enable patients to self-administer) and the diagnostic market was dominated by vial products (since they are cheaper and administered by a professional). Amphastar makes the kit product, for which they received FDA approval in December 2020.

For many years, the glucagon retail market was dominated by Eli Lilly (LLY), which sold retail kits, while the diagnostic market was dominated by Boehringer Ingelheim, which sold the cheaper vials of glucagon to hospitals. Eli Lilly discontinued their glucagon emergency kit in late 2022. Boehringer Ingelheim also wound down their glucagon vial business at the end of 2022. As a result, the glucagon market is now a virtual duopoly belonging to Amphastar (which makes only kits) and Fresenius KABI (which makes both kits and vials).

Mountainside Medical, Fresenius

Black Mamba's analysis of Amphastar's commentary on conference calls shows that Amphastar's glucagon product was initially focused on the retail setting, and it competed explicitly with Eli Lilly as a retail product. In November 2022, the company highlighted the Boehringer exit, which immediately catalyzed massive sales growth. Amphastar's most recent public commentary suggests that more than two-thirds of the Company's glucagon sales are in the diagnostic market.

AMPH Filings, Transcripts November 2022, April 2023

AMPH Transcripts

AMPH's glucagon sales have risen from $0 in 2020 to $48mm, $55mm, and $114mm in 2021, 2022, and 2023. Black Mamba believes the vast majority of the growth from 2022 to today was spurred by the exit of Boehringer from the diagnostic market.

IQVIA data shows Amphastar had virtually 0 share of the clinic and non-federal hospital channels until Boehringer and Lilly began to exit the market:

IQVIA, Black Mamba Analysis

Amphastar has repeatedly called out glucagon as one of their highest margin products (emphasis added):

Gross margins increased to 54% of revenues in the fourth quarter of 2023 from 53% of revenues in the fourth quarter of 2022 due to BAQSIMI sales, which are recorded net of Lilly's expenses, and to strong sales of higher-margin products like glucagon and Primatene MIST."" - Q4 '23 Earnings Call Gross margins improved to 60% of revenues from 49% on increased sales of higher-margin products such as glucagon, Primatene Mist, ganirelix and vasopressin."" - Q3 '23 Earnings Call

As a result, we believe glucagon gross margins are likely greater than 60%, meaning Amphastar likely generated ~$70 million in gross profit from glucagon in 2023.

A. Unsustainable Benefit from Diagnostic Market Share Gain with Fresenius Restocking Complete

Even though AMPH makes a kit product, they have gained significant share in the diagnostic market (which was traditionally dominated by vial products) because Boehringer withdrew from the market and Fresenius was unable to produce enough glucagon vials to fulfill the entire market. As highlighted in the table of historical management commentary above, when AMPH launched their kit in 2021, the sales were predominantly to retail patients; today the diagnostic portion of the market is ~66% of AMPH's glucagon sales:

So right now, of the glucagon market, we had over $100 million in glucagon sales last year. We're at the point now where about 2/3 of those are going towards the diagnostic and about 1/3 is going to the anti-hypoglycemic market, where we have a better market share in that segment."" - Bank of America Healthcare Conference 5/15/2024

Triangulating Amphastar's historical comments, Black Mamba believes that more than 100% of glucagon's growth has come from the diagnostic market in 2023, where AMPH took share while Fresenius' vial product was inadequately stocked:

Black Mamba Estimates

Using the Wayback Machine, we discovered that the American Society of Health-System Pharmacists (ASHP) shortage reports on glucagon describe Fresenius having difficulty maintaining supply for their products as far back as November 2022, January 2023, and May 2023.

ASHP via Wayback Machine

ASHP via Wayback Machine

The most recent ASHP drug shortage page for glucagon has removed the Fresenius products from the ""Products Affected"" section of the page and now lists all three Fresenius SKUs in the ""Available Products"" section. The page now simply states, ""Fresenius Kabi has glucagon available.""

ASHP

Furthermore, Fresenius KABI publishes a weekly PDF with current availabilities for all its products. In late November 2023, we discovered that Fresenius updated their product status for glucagon vials from ""back ordered"" to ""available."" In mid-December 2023, they did the same for their kit offering. In early February, Fresenius listed all three glucagon SKUs as immediately available.

Fresenius Product Availability 11/9/2023

Fresenius Product Availability 11/16/2023

Fresenius Product Availability 2/1/2024

Crucially, Fresenius' kit offering appears to be substantially less expensive - by roughly 26% - compared to Amphastar's kit, according to the McKesson Buyer Portal.

McKesson Buyer Portal

We note that the ""novaplus"" product is manufactured by Fresenius, as indicated by the label for the product. Additionally, the ""NP509603"" code matches the Fresenius KABI product code listed on their availability PDF.

Dailymed

Fresenius Product Availability 6/20/2024

This price differential is echoed by Amphastar's own commentary (emphasis added):

Let me take the first one, which is the glucagon question. The retail versus the institutional market, the last -- we looked it was about 6 -- over 60% retail for us. And so we feel that we have penetrated some of the other markets. I remember our product is slightly higher priced than some of the alternatives."" - Q2 '23 Earning Call

On the May 8, 2024, earnings call, Amphastar appeared to confirm Black Mamba's hypothesis. In a brief and dismissive admission, the company disclosed that a diagnostic competitor has returned to availability.

Our glucagon injection saw changes in demand, specifically in the diagnostics sector due to another manufacturer's product availability. However, our recent entry into the Canadian market underscores our ability to adapt and mitigate market fluctuations effectively"" - Q1 '24 Earnings Call

Unsurprisingly, none of the analysts probed further into this new information. The company claims that the Canadian opportunity represents 10% of the current glucagon sales.

And the way to think about it is that Canada is about 10% of the United States business."" - Q4 '23 Earnings Call

Unfortunately for Amphastar, the Fresenius products compete with two-thirds of the current glucagon sales. Now that the cheaper vials from Fresenius are fully available, we expect Amphastar to cede share in the diagnostic market as customers switch from the expensive kits to the cheaper vial solution.

B. Viatris Likely to Launch in 2024, Lupin Planning to Launch Glucagon in 2025, Meitheal Pharmaceuticals Targeting this Market

The glucagon market in the US is currently shared by Amphastar and Fresenius. Viatris is on the precipice of disrupting this market in the second half of 2024 with a new competitive product.

Viatris Investor Presentation

According to Viatris' investor presentation, glucagon is listed at the top of their pipeline slide and has already been submitted to the FDA for approval.

In fact, on May 9, 2024, Viatris confirmed that glucagon is working through the regulatory process and is expected to launch in the second half of 2024. In other words, Viatris' launch is imminent.

Viatris Q1 2024 Earnings Call

We note that glucagon is listed on the pipeline slide from a recent Viatris R&D event. The logo for glucagon seems to suggest that the product would be an exact clone of Amphastar's injection kit.

Viatris R&D Presentation

Simply put, Viatris expects to bust open this two-player market as a large third competitor which could dramatically reduce Amphastar's market share, sales, and/or margins.

Additionally, we think the market is ignoring the medium-term launch of Lupin Limited's generic glucagon in the coming months.

Lupin Limited, an $8.7bn EV company with a mighty #3 position in the US generic market (by prescription count), has made their portfolio of complex generic injectables a strategic priority for the company's North American business.

Right now, Lupin has a pending application for glucagon with the FDA with expectations of launch in the company's Fiscal 2026 which begins in April 2025.

Interestingly, Lupin announced in November 2023 that the FDA had approved ganirelix acetate - which, like glucagon, is an injectable peptide product - and is specifically manufactured at the Nagpur facility, the same facility that glucagon is going to be produced at. This is evidence that the facility is fully capable of shipping FDA-approved injectable peptide products like glucagon. Incidentally, Amphastar also sells ganirelix, and therefore Lupin is a fresh competitor in that product now as well.

Lupin Ganirelix Approval

On Lupin's Q2 FY2024 call held on November 9, 2023, Lupin's CEO confirmed their expectations are for glucagon to be a material launch for the company.

Lupin Transcript

Finally, as recently as February 8, 2024, the Lupin CEO noted that the ""High-value, low-competition market"" supports Lupin's entry and our thesis that they plan to take significant share in glucagon.

Lupin Transcript

On the May 7, 2024, call, Lupin stated they expect to launch glucagon in their fiscal year 2026 (which begins in April 2025):

Lupin Transcript

We note that there have been zero mentions of Lupin across any investor material from Amphastar over the last five years according to the search function provided by the SEC. In their extensive 10-K disclosure, the company does not even mention Lupin in a section that lists over 25 other generic competitors.

AMPH 10K

Curiously, Amphastar chose not to add Lupin to this list of competitors in the 10-K published in February 2024 even though Lupin entered the ganirelix acetate market with their approval in November 2023 as mentioned above.

Sellside appears to be largely unaware of the looming competitive entries into one of AMPH's most important products. For example, the JPMorgan Amphastar Initiation of Coverage report (rated ""Buy"" with a target price of $60) published on March 5, 2024, argues that the 60% of glucagon revenue from the diagnostic market is:

Relatively safe (and given the technical difficulties in developing and manufacturing the product, another entrant in the market is very unlikely)."" - JPMorgan Initiation Report 3/5/24

Lupin has devoted attention to their glucagon product in half a dozen calls since 2023, frequently highlighting its materiality for their US injectables business. With the new Nagpur plant approved and shipping ganirelix in the US, Black Mamba believes it is only a matter of time before Lupin launches their glucagon product. Lupin is a serious and knowledgeable competitor - they expect this drug to be ""material"" in the context of their ~$800mm revenue US business. If they choose to launch aggressively, AMPH's market share could unravel quickly - especially given that Viatris will likely have entered already.

To make matters worse for Amphastar's cozy and dominant share in glucagon, Meitheal Pharmaceuticals submitted the following FOIA request in December 2023 which requests information specifically for their own labeling development and ANDA submission.

FDA FOIA Logs

NDA 201849 is clearly Fresenius' glucagon vial product, which is used as a diagnostic aid:

FDA Label for Fresenius Glucagon

Meitheal is a formidable generic competitor that has ~90 products listed in the FDA Orange Book and achieved $230mm of sales with profitability in 2023. We note that two members of Meitheal's senior management team (the CEO and EVP of Regulatory) are Fresenius formers.

In fact, Amphastar has recently started to tease the idea of new competition in their investor communication. In response to a question where a sellside analyst dismissed the idea of future glucagon competition, Amphastar suggested this assumption could prove incorrect:

Q: ""… So it doesn't seem like a market that people are going to want to come into on the generic side in the future. But you can offer your own speculation at that point."" A: ""It's a big enough market that would attract other people, especially given the high margin for the product that we have right now."" -- Bank of America Healthcare Conference 5/15/2024

C. Secular Share Shift from Kits to Next-Gen Glucagon Formats is a Net Disadvantage to Amphastar Given Unfavorable Earnout Structure in Baqsimi Acquisition

Amphastar's market share in retail glucagon injection kits (~1/3 of current glucagon revenue) is under attack by next-generation glucagon products. Eli Lilly developed Baqsimi, which treats hypoglycemia through an intranasal spray of glucagon. This product is generally superior to an emergency kit: it doesn't contain a needle or require any preparation, and is significantly smaller and lighter than the syringe kit. Additionally, Xeris Biopharma (XERS) recently launched Gvoke, which is an auto-injector for glucagon that functions like an EpiPen.

Xeris' investor presentation highlights the dramatic share shift from legacy glucagon kits to next-gen glucagon formats. In 2018, legacy kits sold ~400k units without any competition from the new products. In 2023, legacy kits sold only ~160k units, versus ~310k units for Baqsimi and ~190k units for Gvoke. We estimate that roughly $45mm of AMPH's glucagon sales come from the retail market, which should continue to see significant degradation as consumers replace their legacy kits with newer formats. We believe the retail market has declined at a 17% CAGR for legacy glucagon kits since the next-generation products launched.

Xeris Investor Presentation

Knowing that the retail glucagon market is in structural decline, Amphastar elected a proactive approach to mitigate the impact of new glucagon formats to their business. In June 2023, Amphastar entered the branded prescription drug product space for the first time when they acquired Baqsimi from Eli Lilly for $500mm upfront, an additional $125mm to be paid upon the one-year anniversary of the acquisition, and up to $450mm in cumulative milestones over the next 5 years. We believe that many of the sales-based milestones are likely to be achieved, and therefore estimate $200-300mm of milestone payments will be paid to LLY over the next five years. We account for these milestones by assigning probabilities to each payment, discounting them at 8%, and adding them to the adjusted enterprise value to fully reflect the economic impact of these payments.

Critically, these payments will likely represent over 90% of the EBITDA generated by Baqsimi in a given year that a milestone hits. Below, we propose a simple bridge to the drug's economic structure based on the disclosed financial profile of the drug and our estimates. As demonstrated, we project the drug to generate limited cash flow over the coming years due to the significant milestone payments.

AMPH Filings, Black Mamba Estimates

Amphastar's retail glucagon franchise is at risk from next-gen products, which have already demonstrated their ability to steal share from AMPH's kits. Baqsimi is now cannibalizing their high margin kit revenue while most of the success from Baqsimi accrues to Eli Lilly - not Amphastar - in the form of milestones over the next five years and the large guaranteed purchase price (including $500mm at closing and $125 million one year later).

In summary, there are three key factors that, we believe, will lead to diminishing sales of glucagon in 2024 and 2025:

Fresenius, the other key player currently active in the market, has finally returned to regular availability for their glucagon products, which are better suited to the diagnostic market than AMPH's kit

Viatris and Lupin should launch competitive generic products in 2024 and 2025, while Meitheal Pharmaceuticals also appears to be working on an ANDA submission, potentially turning the sleepy two-player market into a five-player knife fight

Amphastar levered up to purchase Baqsimi, which is cannibalizing ~33% (1/3) of the current glucagon revenue that comes from the retail hypoglycemia market. The milestones owed to Lilly siphon the vast majority of the drug's near-term EBITDA away from AMPH to LLY

The precise effect of all these underappreciated competitive headwinds is not simple to model. However, sellside is surely asleep at the wheel: The Street is estimating zero revenue degradation, despite the painfully obvious evidence that revenue declines are highly likely to materialize. Assuming AMPH's retail revenue tracks the industry's -17% CAGR (as previously shown in Xeris' slide deck) and that Amphastar loses material share in the institutional space as Fresenius' lower cost alternative has completely fixed its supply issue and new competitors potentially emerge, we believe there is massive downside to sellside estimates for this product:

2. Pfizer Tornado Beneficiary Products

Across AMPH's portfolio, temporary supply issues at competitors can cause customers to shift demand to Amphastar given the perfect substitutability of most generic injectable drugs. The effect that shortages have on AMPH varies significantly depending on the number of approved suppliers that exist for a generic drug: the effect is minimal when there are several producers, but very meaningful when Amphastar only competes with one or two suppliers.

Amphastar has conditioned the sellside to believe that shortage benefits are a recurring boost to their business as they seem to always have a competitor that is failing to supply one product or another, as demonstrated below:

AMPH Transcript

Right now, Amphastar is benefiting from a truly idiosyncratic supply disruption at a major facility operated by Pfizer due to the devastating effects of a tornado in July 2023. The shutdown of the entire plant is a one-time event - not a recurring shortage opportunity - and seems to be providing a much larger benefit to Amphastar than previous shortage events. Pfizer's supply of these products is on the verge of normalizing, as we will detail below.

A. Temporary Benefit from Pfizer Tornado Disruption Quickly Receding

In July 2023, a tornado struck Pfizer's Rocky Mount, North Carolina facility. The damage to the areas containing raw materials, packing supplies, and the warehouse of finished medicines was significant, but critically, the manufacturing lines were undisturbed. According to Pfizer, this facility produces 25% of Pfizer's injectable portfolio, which translates to 8% of the entire sterile injectable supply in the United States. In the third quarter, Pfizer recorded $209mm of inventory losses and overhead costs from the downtime at the site. This facility was acquired through Pfizer's acquisition of Hospira - a key competitor on many of Amphastar's products.

AMPH has specifically highlighted a handful of drugs that are meaningfully affected by Pfizer's disruption including: atropine sulfate, calcium chloride 10%, epinephrine, dextrose 50%, and sodium bicarbonate 8.4%.

Q: ""And then I guess elsewhere in the portfolio, you had some products, I think that benefited from Pfizer Rocky Mount type of issues...."" A: ""So we sell about 12 products that compete with Pfizer's products that come from that facility. And while they have been right now, we're the only one selling the epinephrine dextrose and sodium bicarbonate and prefilled syringes. I've been at the company for 10 years now. And every quarter I've been here, there has been 1 supply disruption or another at that facility going back to when it was the hospital facility. So it's something that has gone on for 10 years every quarter, and we expect to continue in some way or another, even if they do get back to shipping some of those products again."" - Bank of America Healthcare Conference 5/15/2024

Atropine and calcium chloride have a handful of suppliers. AMPH is currently the sole active manufacturer of the remaining drugs, while the Pfizer facility is down. The company breaks out epinephrine sales, but the rest of the drugs are lumped into the ""other"" category, so the complete impact of the shortage is not directly observable. We think in aggregate, Amphastar's sales are inflated by ~$50mm per annum on a run-rate basis due to these shortages (~$15mm for epinephrine and ~$35mm for the other products).

Black Mamba believes Pfizer is finding its footing and returning to the market at a reasonable pace. In September 2023, Pfizer announced they had restarted the majority of the manufacturing lines at the facility and had launched one new line of sterile injectable capacity, which they describe as ""state-of-the-art.""

Additionally, Pfizer's Hospital unit publishes a daily PDF that lists the availability of its entire injectable product catalogue on their website. Through our analysis of FDA records, we have isolated the NDC identifiers for the specific Pfizer products that compete directly with Amphastar. We acknowledge that bringing these products back to full available supply takes some time and estimated delivery dates can change. That said, we can view - in real time - Pfizer's delivery of competitive products. We highlight that while it will take time for Pfizer to reach full supply recovery, in some of these products, any unit shipped from Pfizer today is a unit taken away from Amphastar given it is a two-player market

Black Mamba Analysis, FDA Shortage Database, Pfizer Availability Reports

We highlight Dextrose 50% as an illustrative example. On the Q3 2023 conference call, the Amphastar CFO said the company is currently the only active manufacturer of Dextrose 50% in the country.

But there's three right now, where we're the only one in the country making them, and that's dextrose, sodium [bi]carbonate and also the epi syringe -- prefilled syringe that's used in emergency rooms. So those three things are -- we're just making as much of those things as we can."" - Q3 '23 Earnings Call

This can be easily verified by the Orange Book listing for the product, which shows an AMPH subsidiary, International Medication Systems, and Pfizer/Hospira as the two providers of this dose and format. As confirmed in the AMPH catalogue, they sell Dextrose 50% 25g / 50ml units - which is the same as the Pfizer product listings.

FDA Orange Book

AMPH Product Specifications

Pfizer Availability Report

Once Pfizer's Dextrose 50% products start shipping, we expect Amphastar to rapidly revert to its normalized market share. As highlighted above, Pfizer is working to release various drug SKUs that are competitive with Amphastar products in the next few months, with 46% of these shortage SKUs shipping by July 2024 and 100% shipping by the end of November 2024.

In fact, we have reason to believe these timelines are achievable based on recent examples of key SKUs returning to full availability. In April, a SKU for calcium chloride was listed as in ""limited supply"" with an expected full recovery date of ""2Q 2024."" The most recent PDF demonstrates that SKU is fully recovered and available.

Pfizer Availability Report 4/16/24

Pfizer Availability Report 6/23/24

Furthermore, Pfizer has started shipping 8.4% sodium bicarbonate vials (not yet syringes) which is a clear improvement in product status from ""depleted"" to ""limited supply"" in the last two months.

Pfizer Availability Report 4/16/24 and 6/23/24

Amphastar has specifically highlighted calcium chloride and sodium bicarbonate volumes as a driver for their Q4 2023 sales in the ""other"" category.

AMPH Filings

B. Capital Improvements to Pfizer's Facility are Likely to Reduce Future Benefits from Temporary Shortages

We note that on the Q3 2023 call, the Amphastar CFO said in his nearly ten years at the company during every quarter they've had some benefit from other competitors experiencing shortages.

AMPH Transcript

We suspect his comment mostly pertains to Pfizer/Hospira given the products he listed as examples. We are optimistic that Pfizer will use this downtime at Rocky Mount to improve the efficiency of the plant relative to its past performance, and we think the installation of the new injectables line is an indication that they plan on doing so. A more efficient Pfizer plant should mean that the future impact of shortages should be reduced.

There is no perfect way to quantify the impact of the shortage. In the next section, we will quantify our estimate of the impact on the Company's epinephrine revenue. We estimate the impact of the shortage benefit to Amphastar's ""Other"" revenue category by subtracting our estimate of the contributions from Vasopressin and Regadenoson in Q3 2023. The fourth quarter of 2023 produced a slightly lower increase in sales year over year, which, we believe, is mostly due to the cessation of medroxyprogesterone sales in August.

AMPH Filings, Black Mamba Estimates

Black Mamba differs materially from Consensus, which appears to be rolling forward the current level of Other sales into the future without much consideration, modeling 4% growth in 2024 and another 3% growth in 2025. As a result, we believe sellside numbers are ~20% too high in 2025:

AMPH Filings, Black Mamba Estimates, Visible Alpha

Even if the operational improvements at the Pfizer facility don't result in less frequent competitor shortages, the key takeaway here is that the current shortage Amphastar is benefitting from is anomalous in its scope.

3. Headwinds to Epinephrine

A. Epinephrine Revenues Particularly Exposed to Competition from the Normalization of Tornado Disruption

Amphastar's revenue from the sale of epinephrine has skyrocketed over the last few years, growing from just under $14 million of revenue in 2019 to ~$81mm in 2023 (and a $100mm run rate in Q4 '23). Amphastar has attributed their success in this product category to two primary factors: competitor shortages in their prefilled syringe product and the launch of a multi-dose vial product in Q2 '20 (Amphastar previously only made prefilled syringes).

FDA Orange Book

Back in November 2021, Pfizer announced a supply disruption associated with their syringe product. At that time, Pfizer anticipated being back on the market in mid-2022. However, it wasn't until mid-2023 that Pfizer eventually rectified these issues. Multiple pieces of evidence support the notion that Pfizer had fixed the epinephrine syringe issue in the summer of 2023.

First, Amphastar alluded to it on their Q2 '23 earnings call:

Lidocaine and epinephrine saw sales declines as competitors returned to these markets.""

Second, Amphastar highlighted a decline unit volumes in their Q2 '23 10-Q:

The decrease in sales of epinephrine and lidocaine was primarily due to a decrease in unit volumes, due to suppliers returning to their historical distribution levels.""

Third, the ASHP shortage website changed their language from:

Pfizer has epinephrine 0.1 mg/mL 10 mL Luer-Lock syringes on back order and the company estimates a release date of June 2023"" - May 12, 2023

To the following on July 26, 2023:

Pfizer has epinephrine 0.1 mg/mL 10 mL Luer-Lock syringes available in limited supply.""

Finally, the Pfizer Injectables Product Availability report said the product was ""depleted"" with ""no current shipments"" on June 13, 2023:

Pfizer Availability 6/13/23 via Wayback Machine

Which was then changed to ""limited supply"" status with ""limited inventory released direct and to wholesale/distributors"" on July 19, 2023:

Pfizer Availability 7/19/23 via Wayback Machine

Critically, this indicates that the delivery planned for June 2023 was, in fact, completed in late June or early July. It is clear from this evidence that Pfizer had returned to the market.

As even more evidence, Black Mamba's analysis of Amphastar's commentary about epinephrine demonstrates that in Q2 2023 (ending in June 2023), AMPH's epinephrine sales declined, with ""suppliers returning to their historical distribution levels"", after consistently touting sales increases due to competitor shortages in prior and subsequent quarters:

AMPH Filings, Black Mamba Analysis

So why is Amphastar still benefitting from epinephrine shortages if Pfizer fixed their issue? Well, right after Pfizer started ramping back up supply of epinephrine, the aforementioned tornado struck Pfizer's warehouse and wiped-out Pfizer's supply of product. We believe that whatever manufacturing issues that existed with the product have been solved (by virtue of their ability to ship product in the summer of 2023) and that Pfizer will come back to the market in full force with their epinephrine prefilled syringe product once the tornado issues are resolved.

Interestingly, Pfizer currently expects to start shipping their epinephrine syringe product again in November 2024 and to recover its full supply by Q1 2025:

Pfizer Availability 6/23/24

B. BPI's New Multi-dose Vial Product Adds Increased Competition to the Market

On top of this, we highlight that BPI, which is already a producer of epinephrine in other formats, was approved in February 2024 as the third company with a 30mg/30mL multi-dose vial. Until this approval, Amphastar had a comfortable duopoly in this product with Endo/Par Sterile.

FDA Orange Book FDA Orange Book

The effect of this competitive launch has not yet been felt in Amphastar's recent reported results, as BPI began marketing the product on March 21, 2024.

FDA NDC Directory

BPI's launch of an identical multi-dose epinephrine will likely reduce AMPH's epinephrine vial business.

We know what the breakdown of AMPH's epinephrine sales were in 2019-2021 based on disclosure provided in the 2021 10-K that provides sales for the epinephrine prefilled syringe:

""For the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020, and 2019, we recorded net revenues of $27.8 million, $13.2 million, and $13.9 million, respectively, for epinephrine prefilled syringes.""

Simple subtraction shows that in 2021, epinephrine vial sales were nearly $30mm, based on total epinephrine sales of $57.5mm. Black Mamba conservatively estimates that multi-dose vials represented 40% of epinephrine sales in 2023. With a new competitor having just launched, AMPH could see sales of its multi-dose vial fall materially, with this two-player market opening into a three-player market.

C. Amneal Expects to Launch Multiple Epinephrine Products in 2025

Even more concerning for Amphastar is that other large generic companies are targeting epinephrine in the near and medium term.

Amneal (already a significant player in other epinephrine formats) is planning to launch several epinephrine products in 2025: a multi-dose vial, a single-dose vial, and a prefilled syringe. Amneal has designated these as ""potential high-value opportunities."" Amneal's launch in epinephrine would further fracture the multi-dose market, but even more significantly, they would be the first competitor to crack the pre-filled syringe duopoly dominated by Amphastar and Pfizer.

Amneal Investor Presentation

D. Gland Pharma Targeting the Epinephrine Market

In March 2024, Gland Pharma - a $3.4bn EV Indian generic manufacturer - requested information on AMPH's 30mg/30mL vial in a FOIA filing:

FDA FOIA Logs

While this FOIA is not itself evidence that they plan to launch epinephrine, Black Mamba thinks it is helpful to note that Gland has followed Amphastar into many of Amphastar's recent injectable product launches. In particular, Gland launched their vasopressin generic in early February 2024, so the impact of that competition has likely not worked its way into AMPH's ""other product"" category either.

FDA Orange Book, Black Mamba Estimates

Stitching this altogether, Black Mamba believes Amphastar epinephrine revenues in 2025 could be ~$34 million, much lower than Visible Alpha consensus of $75 million. As we have demonstrated, Pfizer has been in shortage since 2021, which has caused investors to forget that AMPH's base epinephrine sales are closer to $25mm between vials and syringes.

Black Mamba's estimate assumes Amphastar's epinephrine prefilled syringe revenues revert back to a slight premium to their 2019-2020 levels (pre-Pfizer's shortage). We also assume that the introduction of BPI's new multi-dose vial, and Amneal and Gland's potential launches erode 35% of AMPH's 2021 epinephrine vial base sales:

AMPH Filings, Black Mamba Estimates, Visible Alpha

To hammer home our view that AMPH has passed its peak epinephrine sales, we highlight that the Mark Cuban Cost Plus Drug Company has launched epinephrine syringes as its very first hospital product. The company has already struck a contract to supply a portion of the hospitals owned by Community Health Systems - a $12.5bn revenue hospital system that ranks 8th on the Becker top 100 hospital system list with over 70 hospitals in its network. Per reports, the company is actively searching for other hospital partners for the drug.

""On March 7, CHS announced the partnership, which secures shipments of epinephrine and norepinephrine for nine of the system's hospitals. Since then, Dr. Oshmyansky said he has been in talks with dozens of other health systems and hospitals about potential deals.""

This program is not an incredible threat to Amphastar today but does highlight the increased competitive focus on this product.

4. Primatene MIST

Primatene MIST is an over-the-counter inhaler and was first brought to market in 1963. The product was taken off the market in 2011 due to concerns with CFCs in the propellant, and reintroduced in 2018 following an FDA review that focused on the product's safety and risk / benefit profile. Primatene MIST's API is epinephrine - not a standard bronchodilator like albuterol. Amphastar is targeting Primatene sales of ~$100mm in 2024 and has stated it is among the highest margin products in their portfolio (as referenced above at the beginning of the glucagon section).

A. Key Patent Expiration in January 2026 Opens the Door for Private Label Competition

According to the 2022 10K, Amphastar's patent on Primatene MIST expires in January 2026.

AMPH Filings

This is the only patent listed in the FDA Orange Book for the drug:

FDA Orange Book

Curiously, when comparing the 2022 10-K and 2023 10-K, we noticed AMPH removed the language that clearly stated the near-term expiration of their only IP protection for Primatene MIST (the green below is text added to the 2023 10K and the red is text removed):

AMPH Filings Comparison

We think it is likely that a competitor will launch a private label clone post patent expiry, given the substantial product sales and profit opportunity. Primatene MIST is generally stocked in a pharmacy's allergy aisle, which is littered with private label versions of nearly every single product. Below, we demonstrate the prevalence of private label competition in this category with a photo of a local CVS's allergy aisle that highlights the significant shelf space devoted to CVS branded clones (the red boxes are all private label products).

Black Mamba Primary Evidence

We also note that there are private label aerosol products on the shelf, such as the ""CVS Health Allergy & Sinus Relief Sterile Saline Nasal Mist"" product, suggesting the delivery mechanism of Primatene MIST is unlikely to be a barrier to entry.

Black Mamba Primary Evidence

When private label enters the market, branded products in the allergy aisle suffer. After private label Flonase entered the market, GSK highlighted the sharp pricing degradation as new players tried to steal share (emphasis added):

""We see that competition specifically on private label, Flonase, for instance, where we are seeing really aggressive pricing as retailers compete with each other for that consumer going forward"" - GSK Consumer Healthcare Investor Event November 2017

B. Completed Distribution Rollout Leaves Little Room for Product Growth During Remaining Patent Exclusivity

Since its reintroduction of Primatene MIST in 2018, sales have grown steadily, with management expecting $100mm of revenue in 2024. The strong growth over the last several years was predominantly due to the steady rollout across big box pharmacies and retailers like Amazon, Walmart, CVS, Walgreens, Kroger, and Target. This rollout is now complete and given the OTC nature of the drug and its use as an emergency or dosed-as-needed drug, there are likely no significant new channels left to penetrate. As the company said, halfway through 2021 (emphasis added):

With Primatene, I think we've hit most of the major retail distribution points. We're analyzing and looking at different smaller retail stores, maybe partnerships there. But I think right now, we've hit most of the major retail."" - Q2 '21 Earnings Call

AMPH Presentation

As can be seen on AMPH's own slide, Primatene MIST volumes have stagnated.

In summary, Primatene MIST is protected by a single Orange Book patent, expiring in less than two years. The product could face significant competition from private label products once the patent lapses. We are in-line with Street estimates 2024 and 2025, however, this annuity-like, cash cow product is at risk of massive disruption should a clone launch in 2026. Sellside estimates do not seem to factor in this risk.

Visible Alpha

5. Pipeline Drugs

Like all generic drug manufacturers, Amphastar must maintain a pipeline of new drugs in order to offset the gradual decline of their current portfolio. AMPH devotes numerous slides in their presentations to promote their pipeline assets. They rarely disclose the exact drug until its approval, but they generally tease the investor community by citing the branded product sales, which are frequently multi-hundred-million-dollar markets.

A. Consistent History of Over Promising and Under Delivering on Recent Pipeline Opportunities

While Amphastar constantly talks up the promise of their pipeline, the Company has not launched a single new product that has been large enough to break out individually since glucagon (which was approved in December 2020). To illustrate the point, below we show Amphastar's pipeline slide from their June 2021 investor presentation and show what has happened to each of the products mentioned. The red and green boxes are our own annotations - green denotes products that have eventually received approval and red shows products that are still unapproved:

AMPH Presentation, Black Mamba Annotation

As you can see, the only injectable products approved on this slide to date have been Ganirelix Acetate, Regadenoson, and Vasopressin. Amphastar cited a total of ~$1.5bn of branded sales across these products in their approval announcement press releases.

AMPH Filings, FDA Orange Book, Black Mamba Analysis

More than a year after launching, these drugs are likely each producing less than $4 million of revenue per quarter and are lumped into the ""other"" category because their marginal individual performance does not warrant publication. (Amphastar's smallest individually disclosed drug generates ~$4mm in quarterly sales).

Amphastar has commented on the lack of success they've garnered with these drugs (emphasis added):

Q: ""And then secondly, maybe just talk about the recent launches for ganirelix and vasopressin and what kind of competitive outlook you're seeing for both these products now that you're on the market."" A: ""…And as far as the recent launches go, we've launched both those products into competitive markets, haven't gained as much market share as we thought, but we do see some opportunity for growth in both of those products going forward."" - Q3 '22 Earnings Call

In May 2024, Amphastar announced the approval of AMP-008, which is a generic albuterol inhaler. In the press release, the company flagged the addressable market as $1.7bn based on IQVIA sales.

AMPH Filing

According to the Orange Book, there are many existing competitors in the generic albuterol market, including Teva and Lupin. Teva in particular, discontinued its own ProAir branded product and is presently marketing its own generic with a lower price.

FDA Orange Book

Amneal submitted an NDA for a ProAir albuterol inhaler in July 2023 - citing IQVIA sales of $814mm. The company is expecting to launch their generic by the end of 2024 as well.

""On injectables, we have a liposomal platform as well. So all these key technologies coming and respiratory, we have ProAir, we're expecting approval this year"" - Barclays Conference 3/14/2024

In a market that is already heavily genericized by larger competitors, it seems unlikely that albuterol will drive significant sales for the company. Given the lack of success, Amphastar has had generating revenue from their pipeline over the last three years, we believe investors should not rely on the pipeline to bail them out of the threats to their commercial products in the coming years.

B. Amphastar was Beaten to the Punch on Generic Forteo (Teriparatide) by Two Juggernaut Competitors - Teva and Apotex

Amphastar has been planning to launch a generic of Eli Lilly's blockbuster osteoporosis drug Forteo for several years. AMPH's development of the product was delayed by multiple CRLs, and the company plans to resubmit to the FDA in 2024.

To our AMP-015 ANDA filing, teriparatide, and the CRL received in June, we anticipate filing our response in the fourth quarter this year."" - Q2 '22 Earnings Call In terms of teriparatide, we have received a minor complete response letter, and we anticipate responding to this in the second quarter."" - Q1 '24 Earnings Call

In the meantime, Teva and Apotex each announced approvals for generic Teriparatide in November 2023. Expectations for AMPH's Teriparatide product are high: consensus has it generating probability-adjusted sales of $35mm in 2024 and over $70mm in 2025. We don't know what exact sales this product will generate, but Black Mamba thinks these estimates will be wrong by a very wide margin, given the earlier entries from massive competitors.

Black Mamba Estimates, Visible Alpha

C. AMP-018 is Likely Victoza (Liraglutide) with Teva First to Market and Viatris and Lupin Targeting Launches

Amphastar's biggest pipeline drug by market opportunity is AMP-018 with over $2bn of IQVIA sales. At the JPM Conference in January 2024, the company unveiled that the drug was a GLP-1 product and the company plans to file for approval in 2024.

Black Mamba proposes Novo Nordisk's Victoza (liraglutide) as the identity of AMP-018.

Amphastar filed a Drug Master File (DMF) with the FDA in 2019 for liraglutide, which to our understanding allows them to create the API for the drug in-house. We specifically note that just weeks earlier, AMPH filed a DMF for teriparatide, which is a disclosed pipeline product of Amphastar.

FDA DMF Database, Black Mamba Analysis

According to Novo Nordisk, the compound patents for Victoza (liraglutide) expired in 2023. Viatris (formed from Mylan and Pfizer) and Teva can both launch in June 2024, per legal settlements with Novo.

NVO Filings

In fact, Teva announced on June 24, 2024, the launch of their generic version of Victoza, confirming their entry.

Teva Press Release

Viatris is also expecting to launch liraglutide, and per the R&D event in March 2024, the expectations are for a 2024 launch.

VTRS Presentation

Additionally, Lupin is expecting to launch a competitive product for liraglutide in the next few years, too.

Lupin Transcript

If this GLP-1 drug is liraglutide, we expect Amphastar to compete with these massive players. Amphastar has not yet submitted their product for approval; Teva is now marketing the first generic, with Viatris and Lupin likely coming to market in the near to medium term.

While consensus does not yet have explicit estimates for AMP-018 because it is not even filed yet, we think the true opportunity will be underwhelming given the competition and AMPH's late entry.

Risks to the Thesis

Gaining FDA approval for complex generic injectable drugs is difficult and can result in delays before a drug finally makes it to market. In the case of glucagon and epinephrine, the competitors could take longer to reach approval than we expect, thereby allowing Amphastar to benefit from low competition for longer.

As we have previously mentioned, Pfizer could take more time to stabilize inventory and shipping times for the products that compete directly with Amphastar.

Amphastar's AMP-002 drug has been stuck in FDA regulatory limbo. As the company describes in its presentations, the drug is past its GDUFA date (Q2 '23) with no pending requests from the agency. If this drug is approved, it could help offset the revenue declines we believe are likely in glucagon, epinephrine, and the Pfizer shortage products.

If no private label competitor emerges for Primatene MIST, AMPH could maintain its strong competitive position in this product.

Conclusion

Simply put, our research has uncovered obvious competitive threats up and down Amphastar's product portfolio. Importantly, these competitive threats are in the product lines that Amphastar has historically named as some of their highest margin categories (glucagon, epinephrine, and Primatene MIST). As these competitive headwinds play out and these products become a smaller portion of overall sales, we expect both sales and gross margins to disappoint, resulting in material downside to Amphastar's shares. The following is a build-up to a 2025 valuation. We apply a lower multiple to our estimate of Primatene MIST's contribution to EBITDA to account for the fact that this product may see substantial competitive pressure in 2026 and beyond due to the patent expiry.

Black Mamba Estimates

We think the market is severely unprepared for the likely revenue declines in several of the major products at Amphastar. Gross margins are near all-time highs due to contributions from glucagon, epinephrine and Primatene MIST. As those sales decline, so too should consolidate margins.

We see 50%+ downside to the stock today as these catalysts unfold and competitors bust the non-competitive markets that Amphastar is benefiting from today.","GlucagonWithin the US glucagon injection market, Amphastar is currently operating in an effective duopoly with Fresenius KABI as the other participant.
Amphastar's most recent public commentary suggests that more than two-thirds of the Company's glucagon sales are in the diagnostic market.
Simple subtraction shows that in 2021, epinephrine vial sales were nearly $30mm, based on total epinephrine sales of $57.5mm.
- Q3 '22 Earnings CallIn May 2024, Amphastar announced the approval of AMP-008, which is a generic albuterol inhaler.
Gross margins are near all-time highs due to contributions from glucagon, epinephrine and Primatene MIST.","['2024', 'competitive', 'fade', 'amphastar', 'epinephrine', 'pharmaceuticals', 'pfizer',

Article Thesis

Oxford Lane Capital Corporation (NASDAQ:OXLC) is a closed-end fund that offers a massive 20% dividend yield. But yield alone is not a reason to buy, and investors should consider a couple of other important factors when considering an investment in Oxford Lane Capital and its hefty dividend yield.

What Is Oxford Lane Capital?

Oxford Lane Capital Corporation is a closed-end fund that invests in fixed-income securities, primarily collateralized loan obligations, or CLOs. On its investor relations website, the fund states (emphasis by author):

Oxford Lane Capital Corp. is a publicly-traded registered closed-end management investment company. It currently seeks to achieve its investment objective of maximizing risk-adjusted total return by investing in debt and equity tranches of CLO vehicles. CLO investments may also include warehouse facilities, which are financing structures intended to aggregate loans that may be used to form the basis of a CLO vehicle.

Although CLOs sound relatively similar to CDOs, which are famous (or, some might argue, infamous) for playing a role in the bursting of the housing bubble and the corresponding financial crisis and recession, CLOs are different from CDOs, or collateralized debt obligations. CDOs oftentimes have real estate exposure, while CLOs mostly have corporate credit exposure, as explained here by VanEck (emphasis by author):

The focus of CLOs on corporate credit is worth emphasizing, particularly as concerns in the real estate market emerge. Although there is a type of CLO that invests in real estate loans (CRE CLOs), these are distinct from the $1 trillion CLO market that invests in broadly syndicated leveraged loans. In general, CLOs also have very low indirect real estate exposure as well (e.g. to regional banks or REITs).

Guggenheim Investments explains (emphasis by author):

CLOs derive principal and interest from an actively managed, diversified pool of non-investment grade, senior-secured corporate loans.

In the past, the performance of CLOs has been way more stable compared to the performance of CDOs, especially during past crises such as the Great Recession. A Yale paper by Steven H. Kasoff notes (emphasis by author):

Collateralized Loan Obligations (CLOs), which uses corporate debt instead of mortgages, performed well through the financial crisis; it remains a vibrant market today.

Since the paper was published in 2022 and since the author argues that the CLO market remained healthy at that time, we can also conclude that the CLO market did reasonably well during the pandemic.

With Oxford Lane Capital investing in these assets, the fund does not look too risky at first sight. Of course, we also have to consider other factors, such as leverage and management's ability to choose the right CLOs for investment. Oxford Lane Capital uses leverage, which generally increases risks for closed-end funds (and other investors), all else equal. After all, when asset prices decline, the hit to the fund's equity is higher when the fund uses leverage. If, for example, a fund uses 50% equity and 50% debt to buy assets, and those assets decline by 5%, the fund's equity would take a 10% hit. On the other hand, using leverage can also increase returns during good times. If a fund with 50% debt and 50% equity were to experience a 5% asset price gain, its equity would climb by 10%. Using leverage does thus increase both the potential risks as well as the potential returns.

Oxford Lane Capital invests in both the equity tranches as well as the debt tranches of CLOs. Equity tranches are higher-risk but offer higher returns, while debt tranches are lower-risk and offer lower returns. When we take a look at Oxford Lane Capital's report of holdings at the end of 2023, we see that the asset allocation is heavily weighted towards equity tranches:

CLO debt investments totaled $97 million at cost, and $87 million at fair value, as of the end of 2023. Meanwhile, CLO equity investments totaled $1.785 billion at cost and $1.385 billion at fair value. At fair value, the CLO equity allocation was thus around 16x as large as the CLO debt allocation. There are also some other investments (""other CLO equity related investments"") worth $11 million. Overall, all investments combined have a fair value of $1.483 billion, which is equal to 140% of net asset value per the company's report. We can thus deduct that Oxford Lane buys assets worth $1.40 for every $1 of equity the fund has, suggesting that there is considerable leverage usage. From the aforementioned numbers, we can also see that the heavy allocation to equity tranches increases risks substantially, as the fair value of Oxford Lane Capital's CLO equity investments, relative to their cost, is much lower compared to the CLO debt investments. Oxford Lane Capital's CLO debt investments experienced a write-down of around 10%, on average, while CLO equity investments experienced a write-down of around 22%, on average. With OXLC being primarily allocated towards CLO equity investments, the average write-down across the entire portfolio is quite sizeable, at 21.7% (current value of $1.483 billion versus cost of $1.894 billion).

While CLOs are not overly risky per se, Oxford Lane Capital's considerable leverage and heavy allocation to the riskier equity tranches means that Oxford Lane Capital, overall, is not a low-risk investment, I believe. The substantial value movements that CLO equity investments can experience, in combination with considerable leverage usage, have resulted in major net asset value movements in the past:

Data by YCharts

Since 2011, Oxford Lane Capital has experienced a net asset value decline of 73%, or around three-quarters. For every dollar in net asset value that exists today, there were close to $4 dollars a little more than a decade ago. This isn't solely due to the inherent risks in a CLO equity investment however, as Oxford Lane Capital's dividend policy also plays a role.

OXLC: The High Yield Comes At A Cost

The company pays out a pretty sizeable dividend, after all -- the current dividend yield is 20%, based on a monthly payout of $0.09 and a share price of $5.40. The dividend has recently been increased, but the dividend growth track record is still far from great. In fact, some might describe it as pretty bad, considering the following chart:

Data by YCharts

While the dividend is up slightly from the lows seen in 2020, the dividend is down a lot from the highs seen a decade ago. It is important to note that OXLC made quarterly dividends for some time in the past, meaning the $0.60 per quarter dividend we see in the above chart is equal to $0.20 per month. The dividend reduction is thus not as bad as it looks at first sight, but a dividend reduction from $0.20 per month to $0.08 per month is still pretty hefty -- especially when we consider the fact that inflation has been meaningful and that even a flat dividend at $0.20 per share per month would be a lot less today, relative to a decade ago, in real terms.

When it comes to dividend coverage, Oxford Lane Capital has not fared too well in the past -- which is why the fund's net asset value continued to deteriorate for years. Over the last year, things looked better, as OXLC generated net investment income (on a GAAP basis) of $0.92 per share last year, roughly equal to the annual payout of $0.95 per share. On an adjusted basis, coverage was better, as OXLC earned $1.16 per share on a non-GAAP basis last year, which resulted in a roughly 1.2x coverage of the $0.95 per share dividend. With the increased dividend of $1.08 per share per year, the GAAP payout ratio would be north of 100% this year if profits are equal to last year, while the non-GAAP payout ratio would be slightly below 100% if profits remain stable this year.

Since Oxford Lane Capital has a history of paying out more than it earns, I believe that there is a considerable risk that the company will get back to that at some point in the future. With a decade of net asset value declines under its belt, it seems reasonable to assume that more of the same could be coming in the future -- although that isn't guaranteed, of course.

So while one can get a huge dividend yield from OXLC right now, this high yield has historically come at a cost. The CLO equity allocation, the high expenses (the most recent annual report notes a 9.67% expense ratio), and the fact that OXLC has historically paid out more than it earned have resulted in a huge net asset value decrease. This has also caused several dividend reductions in the past. Someone buying a decade ago has seen a sub-par total return relative to what was possible elsewhere:

Data by YCharts

Despite the high dividend yield, OXLC only managed to generate an 87% total return over the last decade, or 6.5% per year. If one had invested in the broad market (SPY), the Nasdaq 100 (QQQ), or even a dividend growth-oriented ETF such as Schwab U.S. Dividend Equity ETF (SCHD), one would have made way more money, despite a smaller dividend yield. Buying a growth ETF such as QQQ and selling some shares from time to time would have resulted in cash inflows (due to share sales) as well and would have made for a way better total return. Chasing yield has thus not worked out well when it comes to OXLC in the past.

Takeaway

I thus believe that OXLC may not necessarily be a bad pick, but it is not a low-risk pick, either, due to leverage and the high CLO equity allocation, and from a total return perspective it has been sub-par. For someone prioritizing income and cash flows at all costs, it could be a solid choice, but for many other investors, higher return picks with a positive net asset value trajectory and lower expenses could be more opportune choices, even if they have lower dividend yields.","kellyvandellenArticle ThesisOxford Lane Capital Corporation (NASDAQ:OXLC) is a closed-end fund that offers a massive 20% dividend yield.

Introduction

Triumph Financial (NASDAQ:TFIN) is a regional bank that has not been immune to the struggles of its peers as interest rates rose sharply in late 2022 and 2023. The bank has a strong focus on the transportation industry as it provides payment technology designed for that sector. Last summer, I detailed why I was avoiding the bank’s preferred shares (NASDAQ:TFINP). Since then, the bank has shown some improvement, but I am still avoiding common shares and rate the preferred shares a buy.

Triumph Financial Results

Until recently, Triumph Financial has been able to manage a low borrowing yield, in fact, one of the lowest borrowing yields I’ve seen. The bank has done a good job attracting and retaining noninterest deposits. Additionally, the bank has high asset yields, and while both asset and borrowing yields went in the wrong direction during the first quarter, the net interest spread, and net interest margin are still very healthy.

Bank Financials Bank Financials

Despite the higher borrowing yields, Triumph Financial’s interest expense declined in the first quarter. The bank’s interest income did ease back, which led to the slight decline in net interest income (interest income less interest expense). Despite the slight decline, the bank’s net interest income remains well above pre-pandemic levels and only 10% off of 2022 levels.

Bank Financials Bank Financials

Loans and Deposits Heading in Two Different Directions

Triumph’s concentration of loans to deposits was a concern for me a year ago, but today it is far less an issue. The bank has seen year over year lending decline in all but one quarter since the middle of 2021. While lending has increased in four of the last five quarters, the declines in the fourth quarter practically offset all those quarterly gains.

Bank Financials

On the other side, deposit growth has suddenly become robust with the first quarter yielding higher quarterly deposit growth than any time during the pandemic. The company explained this was in part due to an increase in deposits in its mortgage warehouse facility. The mortgage warehouse deposits come with a rebate, which is recorded as a decline in asset yields. Hence, the asset yield decline had less to do with loans and more to do with rebate-based deposit growth. While the concentration of non-interest deposits remains high, interest deposits were the leading area of growth in the first quarter, which explains the tick up in the bank’s (albeit still low) borrowing yield.

Bank Financials SEC 10-Q

With management indicating the mortgage warehouse deposits will continue to grow in future quarters, investors can expect a couple of things. First, the bank will be less dependent on external financing. This is already evident by the reduction in borrowing from the Federal Home Loan Bank in the first quarter from $255 million to $30 million. Secondly, the loan to deposit ratio should continue to ease downward. At 93%, the ratio is higher than peers, but noticeably lower than most quarters in the past five years. A lower loan to deposit ratio also signals less dependence on external financing.

SEC 10-Q Bank Financials Bank Financials & Federal Reserve Weekly Commercial Banking Report

Risks to Triumph Financial

An investment in Triumph Financial preferred shares is not risk free and there are a few concerns I have. First, the bank’s loan composition is in part a strength because over half of it is tied into commercial and factored receivables, these types of loans tend to be shorter term loans with better collateral. Additionally, the bank has $820 million in commercial real estate loans. Despite management comments that the CRE loans have not worsened quarter to quarter, there are caution flags beginning to emerge in the bank’s entire loan portfolio.

SEC 10-Q SEC 10-Q

The bank classifies loans as either ‘pass’ or ‘classified.’ In the fourth quarter of 2023, the bank had $191 million in ‘classified’ loans. In 2024, the amount of ‘classified’ loans rose to $214 million and represents more than 5% of total loans. This is particularly concerning considering the bank carries an allowance for credit losses of under 1% of gross loans, which is far below the industry average of 1.6%.

SEC 10-Q SEC 10-Q Bank Financials

Deposit flight is another concern I have with the bank. As it stands, the bank currently has $1.8 billion in uninsured deposits and approximately $1.4 billion in liquidity with the FLHB and Federal Reserve. A reversal in the bank’s deposit trends could have detrimental effects on its earnings. Because of concerns regarding loan performance and uninsured deposits, combined with the recent naming of the bank as one of the highest priced banks in terms of valuation, I am avoiding the common shares.

SEC 10-Q SEC 10-Q

Conclusion

Triumph Financial’s deposit growth improvement and outlook has been key to swinging my opinion of the bank’s 8.3% yielding preferred shares to a buy rating. The bank has good interest spreads and margins and appears to have created value with technology in the freight and transport space. Despite these strengths, I do have concerns about loan performance and the low level of allowances against the portfolio. Should risks metastasize, they will primarily affect the common shares, and I do not see a risk to the preferred shares, therefore I believe income investors should consider adding the bank’s preferred stock to their portfolio.","Since then, the bank has shown some improvement, but I am still avoiding common shares and rate the preferred shares a buy.

Micron (NASDAQ:MU) is one of the largest memory companies in the world, with a market capitalization of more than $150 billion. The company has been lifted heavily by the artificial intelligence wave, growing from more than $60 billion. As we'll see throughout this article, with continued competition and capital requirements, the company's earnings highlight how it doesn't have the earnings to justify its valuation.

Micron Overview

Micron has continued to deliver above guidance ranges as demand for DRAM remains strong.

Micron Investor Presentation

The company has continued to see price increases from temporary GPU demand, and it is performing well as part of the $10s of billions of AI GPU demand. The company expects demand to remain strong going to next year, but AI also requires hefty artificial intelligence investments, and we expect demand to peak in the next few years.

Micron End Market Views

The company sees itself as being in the early innings of a multi-year race to enable AGI.

Micron Investor Presentation

We see this as optimistic, chat models like ChatGPT are impressive, but there's minimal indication of the breakthroughs required to turn LLMs into AGIs. Meta's AI chief himself has discussed how LLMs with the current models will never hit AGI. Micron is pricing itself and arguing about an industry and the revolutionary aspects when it's yet to exist.

More so, the company isn't even building that industry, it just knows should it exist with current models, its DRAM will be essential. The company does, at the end of the day though, continue to operate in a commodity industry. One that continues to fight the powerhouse Samsung, which continues to build the fastest DRAM for AI.

Micron Outlook

The company's outlook is for continued strength in the market driven by artificial intelligence.

Micron Investor Presentation

The company is expecting a bit demand growth to be in the mid-teens percentage rate, although that'll be impacted by price declines. The company does expect supply growth to be below demand growth, the impact of reduced capex during a tough time for the market. With HBM3E memory, that's expected to have an impact, with 3 times wafer supply consumption.

The company is maintaining capex discipline, but capex is expected to expand next year to continue to support investments.

Micron Capex

Micron expects FY24 capex plan to be $8 billion, with WFE spending down YoY in FY24.

Micron Investor Presentation

The company expects to increase capex substantially next year, from ~30% of revenue today, to the mid-30s% range of growing revenue for FY25. This will support HBM assembly and test equipment, and expects average quarterly capex to be meaningfully above $3 billion. That's concerning because it locks the company into more spending and if things change it's in a tough position.

The company has had issues in the past where it's ramped up capex, and a sudden downturn has put it in a tough position given the forward-looking nature of capex. This is both a potential benefit and a potential concern. Especially because the capex isn't all AI, part of it is making up for prior lower capex.

Micron Financial Performance

The company's financial performance shows both the benefits of AI, along with the company's lack of ability to justify its valuation.

Micron Investor Presentation

The company saw revenue increase in all segments, especially in the artificial intelligence Storage and Compute and Networking. Those are segments that have benefited from overall strong artificial intelligence demand. However, it's worth noting that revenue was atrocious a year ago, and that it simply doesn't have the revenue today to justify its valuation.

Micron Investor Presentation

The company earned $6.8 billion in revenue at a 28% gross margin, with operating expenses at just under $1 billion. Diluted EPS came in at $0.62, annualized at almost $2.5 / share, putting the company at a P/E ratio of more than 50. That shows how the company needs substantial growth and profit to justify future shareholder returns.

To hit a P/E of 10, the company needs almost $4 billion in quarterly profits, well above the company's gross margin not counting all of its other expenses.

Micron Investor Presentation

A better picture of the company's business is from FY-21 to FQ3-24, which included a time of massive strength for tech, and a substantial portion of the artificial intelligence business. The company returned $5.5 billion to shareholders during that time, along with repurchases that in retrospect were intelligence.

However, the company only managed to return less than 4% of its current market cap to shareholders over almost 4 years. Those are annualized returns of roughly 1% and shows how lofty the company's valuation is.

Micron Shareholder Returns

The company's future returns are based on its guidance for FQ4-2024, along with 2025.

Micron Investor Presentation

The company expects $7.6 billion in revenue and a higher gross margin, but with a growth in expenses. EPS is expected to increase dramatically QoQ, but still nowhere near a long-term sustainable quarterly EPS of ~$3-4 / share to justify the company's valuation long-term. The company is providing low single-digit returns in the meantime.

It's also concerning that the company spends most of its cash on share repurchases. That can help in a downturn, but at its current inflated prices, we see it as a poor decision.

Thesis Risk

The largest risk to our thesis is a market flush with cash searching for opportunity, and artificial intelligence is fulfilling that gap. Investors are bidding up Micron's share price. Those investors can outbid your selling or betting against Micron's share price, and the market can remain irrational longer than you can remain solvent.

Conclusion

Micron is a great company with a unique portfolio of DRAM products. The company has shown the ability to weather the downturn and increased consolidation in the industry, and is now a top 3 DRAM company, sharing the throne with Hynix and Samsung. However, despite that strength, the company is heavily overvalued in a volatile industry.

The company has a market capitalization of $150 billion, and it needs billions annually to justify its valuation. It's ramping up capital spending, which could put it in a tough position if prices take a turn for the worse. Overall, Micron is a solid company, but overvalued, which makes it a poor long-term investment.","As we'll see throughout this article, with continued competition and capital requirements, the company's earnings highlight how it doesn't have the earnings to justify its valuation.

Cava Group (NYSE:CAVA), a Mediterranean fast-food chain that's making strides in the QSR landscape, has been one of the best-performing stocks in the market since its IPO.

While the prospects of the company remain immaculate, the valuation deters investors from joining the ride.

FOMO is not a long-term winning strategy in investing, and I think patience with Cava will be key.

Revisiting The Cava Craze

I started covering Cava on Seeking Alpha at the beginning of 2024, naming the company America's next big food chain. In my first article about the company, I told its origin story, went over its differentiated offering, and dived into its extremely attractive growth prospects.

Sadly, I was afraid to pull the trigger and rated the stock a Hold, as I found its valuation too prohibitive, as the company traded at a wide premium over Chipotle (CMG), despite several risks and uncertainties.

Data by YCharts

Well, I was wrong. Cava shares went on to more than double since then. looking back, I think that a mid-single-digit EV/Sales multiple was in fact an attractive valuation.

I don't think this is a hindsight claim. I believe I placed too much weight on low-probability risks, and disregarded the sufficient amount of evidence that showed Cava is exceptionally managed and therefore should be evaluated with the assumption everything will most likely go according to plan.

With that in mind, let's talk about the future because all that belongs to the past.

Decent (But Not Great) First Quarter Didn't Cool Off Enthusiasm

When I wrote my February update on Cava, I anticipated a lackluster first quarter, which I thought (or hoped) could potentially provide an attractive entry point.

In Q1, Cava revenues grew 30.3% to $256.3 million, while revenues at the group level increased by 27% to $259.0 million.

Growth was driven by store openings, with 23% unit growth Y/Y, as well as same-store sales growth of 2.3%.

SSS included a 1.2% decline in traffic, offset by a 3.5% increase in average ticket, which reflects pricing and product mix.

Cava Q1'24 Presentation

Those numbers aren't all that impressive, compared to Chipotle, which grew comparable sales by by 7.0% in the quarter. To Cava's defense, it had a 28.4% increase in SSS last year, compared to Chipotle's 10.9%.

In terms of AUV, Cava also underperformed, with a sequential decline and a 2.4% increase Y/Y, whereas Chipotle had a sequential increase and a 6.6% improvement Y/Y. Again, to Cava's defense, its fleet is much smaller, making the portion of new stores, which are yet to ramp up, much bigger.

Cava Q1'24 Presentation

The more positive parts of the results were margins and footprint expansion, both coming in better than expected by both investors and management. Cava demonstrated the ability to expand its footprint organically (no Zoe's Kitchen conversions) and maintain extraordinary efficiency at this early stage.

Cava Q1'24 Presentation

Building on the better-than-expected results, Cava revised its full-year guidance upwards. It now reflects mid-to-high single-digit comparable sales growth in the latter part of the year.

I think it's fair to say I was right about my forecast regarding the relatively underwhelming results. After all, this is arguably one of the highest-valued companies in the sector and it underperformed several peers. However, as we all know, the market didn't budge.

Prohibitive Valuation Requires Patience

I usually dedicate the last section of my article to valuation, but I think that in this case, a potential entry-point catalyst discussion is the more interesting part of my analysis. Therefore, we'll transition to valuation here.

Data by YCharts

Cava currently trades at 11.4 times 2024 revenues, and 9.5 times next year's. This is an astounding number for a restaurant company.

For those who are saying Cava is the next Chipotle, here's a very important data point for you. Chipotle has never in its history traded above an 8.3x multiple:

Data by YCharts

Today, Chipotle is trading at 7.8 times forward revenues and 6.9 times 2025 revenues, so around a 30% discount compared to Cava.

The key thing to understand here is that while Cava might have a longer runway for elevated growth (Chipotle has 10x more locations), both companies have a reasonable path to at least a decade of mid-teens growth in revenues.

I don't think you can justify buying Cava's much higher valuation based on its 2035's growth prospects. That's too long-term, and there will most likely be plenty of opportunities to buy it in a better situation than the current one.

If you're asking what would be a price that I would define as attractive, I would say an 8.5x forward sales multiple would make sense, reflecting a 25% drop.

Chasing A Stock

We all know the feeling of loving a business but not pulling the trigger because of valuation, just to see the company's stock continue to go up. I can think of many names in my own personal list, including Costco (COST), Walmart (WMT), and Fair Isaac (FICO).

You can definitely add Cava to this list as well.

There are also many companies that I've been following for a long time, which I was reluctant to buy initially, and bought at a later stage at an even higher price. Names in that list include Ferrari (RACE), Chipotle (CMG), and Alphabet (GOOG).

The way I see it, a buy decision, especially when it comes to entering a new position, should be based on the right balance between conviction, a company's quality, its growth prospects, and of course, valuation.

Let's take Chipotle as an example. For a long time, I thought Chipotle was an exceptional business with immaculate growth prospects. I didn't have the stomach to buy at what I thought was a rich valuation.

After several quarters of following the company (and a 40% rise in stock price), I finally had enough conviction, as I've seen continued execution, and more importantly, management started talking about long-term targets that made a lot of sense to me. I finally had enough conviction and bought heavily and Chipotle continues to be one of my best investments, even though I missed the initial upside.

One might say that I should have bought even earlier, but I disagree. That's because, if you buy a stock on low conviction, any significant drop in price might make you question your decision. Then, you'll wind up selling at the bottom, lose your enthusiasm about the company, and never get back in time. That exact thing happened to me with Booking Holdings (BKNG), which I bought too early at $3,700, and sold at $3,400, just to then see it reap to $4,000.

The point is, I think that the same company can be a good investment for one investor and bad for the other, based on their different levels of conviction.

With Cava, I truly hope I'll have the opportunity to buy when the right balance between conviction, quality, growth, and valuation finally happens. I don't mind if that will be when the stock is 2x higher than what it is today, because I know that at the current valuation, it can't be a good investment for me.

With that, let's switch gears and ask the all-important question, what could be the catalyst for Cava to finally reach that desired place?

Potential Entry-Point Catalysts In Cava

As long as nothing out-of-the-ordinary occurs, Cava should continue to grow at a high-teens to low-twenties pace for the foreseeable future.

The only question is what the stock would do in reaction to these numbers. As we discussed, I think that at the current valuation, Cava shares won't go up if the company meets these expectations or even slightly beats them. The company will need to come way above these expectations.

The problem is, it's essentially impossible. Cava is opening locations at a ~50-unit annual pace, and stores are already experiencing significant waiting lines, limiting the potential growth in same-store sales. There's only so much you can do with increasing throughput, especially at this stage of the company.

Therefore, I think that one of two things needs to happen. Either Cava disappoints investors, leading to a selloff that will create a buying opportunity, or, the stock will constantly trail fundamental growth until they finally realign at the price target we discussed.

It might happen next quarter, and it might happen in several years. Until then, we'll have to remain patient.

Conclusion

Cava has demonstrated remarkable execution so far, and it checks every box as a business.

The management team clearly studied Chipotle and is following in its footsteps across many key pillars, including employee satisfaction, balance sheet prudence, marketing methods, and operational techniques.

With its differentiated Meditteranean offering, I expect Cava to continue to grow at a ~20% pace for the foreseeable future.

Unfortunately, the valuation is out of sorts, and I don't see how it continues to expand, as Cava is already trading nearly 50% above Chipotle's all-time peak multiple.

I will continue to wait patiently for the right entry price, which might come in the distant future, or very quickly in case of a panic selloff as the market has set an impossible bar.

Investment Thesis

The prevalent theme impacting B Riley's (NASDAQ:RILY) fundamentals in the past quarter has been deleveraging. The ticker's share price has been influenced by factors beyond fundamentals however, particularly rumors and controversies regarding their association with Brian Kahn, the CEO of Franchise Group. Kahn was linked to individuals found guilty of securities fraud, according to a Bloomberg article published earlier this year.

Two independent investigations by RILY's board and an external law firm exonerated the company from any wrongdoing, but the toll on management's time meant delays in releasing the 10-K, which had operational implications, especially for RILY's capital market segment after some customers delayed decisions to solicit RILY for their capital-raising needs until its 10-K was out.

RILY's complicated operations, weakness in internal controls, and overall lack of transparency in its quarterly and annual reports exacerbated the impact of these headwinds. Short interest stands at 50% of shares at the time of this writing.

In the previous article, we noted that there is a narrow dividend-safety cushion, but speculated that RILY will maintain its dividend, powering through until capital markets condition rebound on the back of a stable interest rate environment after aggressive hiking in 2022/2023. This didn't happen, and RILY cut its dividend payments, channeling funds to repay debt. Moreover, its profitability has deteriorated significantly, warranting a revision in our initial speculative buy.

On the other hand, RILY's deleveraging plans are positive for its publicly-traded notes maturing in 2026, which trade a significant discount to redemption price, making them attractive for high-yield investors. Although RILY's earnings decline have pushed its cash payout ratio into negative territory, interest rate coverage remains sufficient, albeit with a narrow safety cushion.

Management attributes Q1 2024 decline to exceptional circumstances, citing delayed 10-K release and distractions associated with its two internal investigations. So, we could see a rebound in profitability that brings dividend payout ratio to the green territory. However, we believe that moving capital away from RILY's equity into its bonds is a safer bet.

This analysis gives an update on RILY's prospects in light of its recent Q1 2024 results.

Brokerage Activities Winding Down

RILY's brokerage business took a hit in Q1 2024, with securities borrowed assets (and associated liabilities) down by 28.6%. RILY borrows equity on behalf of its clients (Reported as Securities Borrowed Assets) and simultaneously lends them (reported as Securities Loaned Liabilities) to facilitate its clients' short trades.

Despite the low earnings contribution of the brokerage segment ($2.4 million in Q1 2024), this decline has had a meaningful impact on the balance sheet. For example, 80% of the decline in RILY's assets in Q1 2024 is attributed to a decline in Securities Borrowed. Similarly, more than 80.4% of the decline in RILY's liabilities in Q1 2024 was tied to a decline in Securities Loaned.

In Q1 2024 Total Assets declined by $1.1 billion or 17.7%, hitting $4.9. Total liabilities declined $1 billion (17.8%), reaching $4.7 billion. As mentioned above, 80% of the decline in both accounts is attributed to a decline in the brokerage segment.

Other than maintaining relations with high net worth clients, I don't think that losing some brokerage business would have a meaningful impact on the company's earnings. In 2023, Interest income from securities lending was $161.7 million, weighed against $145.4 million in interest expense associated with these accounts, leaving a narrow gross profit margin of $16.3 million for the year.

In my view, this is more than offset by the complexity that this segment creates, given that interest income is recorded along with interest income from RILY's bridge loans it extends to the likes of Brian Kahn and other borrowers, which are not related to brokerage activities. This kind of counterintuitive accounting is part of why the market feels alienated from RILY. In my view, RILY would be better off without its brokerage business, and I'm not shedding any tears seeing the segment decline in Q1 2024, but the problem is if this decline is a symptom of something more serious, such as a reputational damage that alienated RILY's customers.

Deleveraging

Beyond brokerage accounts, the decline in RILY's liabilities is a result of a redemption of $115 million of RILY's 2024 notes, repayment of $30 million term loans, $21.6 million net reduction in the credit line balance, and repayment of about $6 million senior loans.

The $115 million redemption of RILY's senior notes, traded under the symbol (RILYO) is the largest contributor to the company's total liabilities decline. The notes carried an interest rate of 6.75% and were purchased at principal value of $25. It is worth noting that this was a partial redemption, with a balance of $25 million remaining on the company's books as of March 2023, but it is likely to have been repaid now, given that the notes reached maturity on May 2024.

RILYO has been trading near redemption price for some time now, so, the opportunity for RILY to buy its debt directly in the public market at the current discounted prices wasn't an option. This is also true for (RILYM), its senior notes maturing in 2025. However, notes maturing beyond 2025 are trading at a discount, opening an opportunity for RILY to repurchase its debt at a discount. For example, the 2026 notes, i.e. (NASDAQ:RILYG) (NASDAQ:RILYK) and (NASDAQ:RILYN), trade at a steep discount of the $25/note redemption price. In contrast to the preferred shares, there are no restrictions on RILY's ability to repurchase these loans at market prices. So, deleveraging could be a strategic option for the company. If this happens, it is unlikely that RILY will purchase all the shares, but its purchasing activity will create a much-welcomed liquidity, enhancing their value for those that don't wish to sell these loans. It goes without saying that RILY's notes offer more income security compared to its common equity, offering a much less risk for income-oriented investors. Below is an overview of RILY's notes trading at a discount to redemption price which could offer an attractive alternative to income-oriented investors.

Current Price Discount Current Yield YTM RILYG $ 17.94 -28% 6.90% 18.86% RILYK $ 21.49 -14% 6.40% 14.50% RILYN $ 19.19 -23% 8.36% 18.99% Click to enlarge

Cash Flows

RILY's investment portfolio is plagued by financially challenged companies. In a previous article, we highlighted RILY's investment strategy, noting that:

RILY's loan strategy isn't just about high yields from financially struggling companies. It's more sophisticated. RILY guides these debt-ridden firms toward issuing new equity to repay loans. In doing so, and by stepping in as an underwriter, RILY isn't just getting its loan money back but also pocketing underwriting fees as well.

The company doesn't provide details on specific holdings within its investment portfolio, but value-write-offs have been a common theme in recent quarters. The company invested aggressively during the pandemic rally,, capitalizing on the meme-stock bonanza, but as fed started hiking interest rates, problems started to surface.

Management often stresses the non-cash nature of its GAAP losses to establish confidence in its ability to pay interest and dividend. To measure the ability of the company to pay dividends and interest, we calculate the EBITDA coverage ratio, but take one step further and adjust it for non-cash items, such as write-offs and mark-to-market adjustments on its loan and equity portfolio. Here is a reconciliation of our 'Adjusted' EBITDA

Millions $ Q1 2024 Net Income $ (65,044) Interest Expense $ (44,864) Depreciation & Amortization $ (15339) EBITDA $ (4841) Trading Loss $ 29,868 Investment write-offs $ 29,545 Adjusted EBITDA $ 54,572 Click to enlarge

From these figures, it appears that RILY was barely able to cover its interest expense in Q1 2024, a stark deviation from its position in 2023, when the company enjoyed a relatively healthy interest coverage. Q1 was exceptional given the delay in releasing the 10-K and internal investigations which took a toll on management's time, so, we'll have to see how this plays out in the rest of the year, but Q1 results are enough to warrant a rating downgrade for its common equity in light of a potential dividend cut.

Valuation

RILY is unprofitable, so standard valuation models don't make sense, impacting our ability to use standard DCF models and PE ratios. Throw in the sheer complexity of its financial reports, and it becomes almost impossible to pin down its value. Our prior valuation was based on a dividend discount model, but then, at the time, the company was generating enough to pay dividends, unlike the current situation. The company trades at a book value of 2.4x, which is above the industry average, but then, its Price to Sales ratio is 0.44x, a fraction of peers' average, mirroring the revenue-generation power of its assets. Going forward, we see RILY in critical need to lower its interest rate expense by selling assets and repaying debt. The company was able to raise cheap capital during the pandemic, but as its loans reach maturity, RILY will find itself refinancing in a much higher interest rate environment.

Final Thoughts

In the prior article, we noted that while RILY generated enough cash to cover interest and dividends, the absence of a substantial buffer was evident. Its Adjusted Operating Income was only a few millions above its interest and dividend expense. The buy rating at the time was predicated on the assumption that RILY would be able to capitalize on a rebound in the capital market activity. This didn't happen, with the company citing distractions stemming from its inability to prepare its 10-K on time. We acknowledge the extraordinary circumstances but also note that the steep decline in profitability in Q1 2024 warrants a rating downgrade.

RILY's 2026 notes offer a much better risk/reward alternative to RILY's shares. They are trading at a discount to the redemption price and the potential for RILY to continue executing its deleveraging initiative could push it to start purchasing these notes on the market, enhancing liquidity which could eventually increase their value.","Management attributes Q1 2024 decline to exceptional circumstances, citing delayed 10-K release and distractions associated with its two internal investigations.

Seeking Alpha,https://seekingalpha.com/article/4701830-ymax-etf-striking-a-balance-between-high-yields-and-risk-management?source=feed_all_articles,2024-07-01,12:44:39 UTC,YMAX ETF: Striking A Balance Between High Yields And Risk Management (NYSEARCA:YMAX),"JimVallee

In February, I published an article on YieldMax NVDA Option Income Strategy ETF (NVDY) concluding that while the fund's performance was notable, the risks of single issued stock investments, further convoluted by options trading, made investing into the fund too risky for my investment style. I thought a more risk managed way to own something like NVDY was to own YieldMax Magnificent 7 Fund of Option Income ETFs (YMAG) or the YieldMax Universe Fund of Option Income ETF (NYSEARCA:YMAX), which both contain NVDY. This article will cover YMAX. While the fund and it's underlying holdings have performed well, I believe more time is needed to test the fund's strategy against different market conditions.

Fund Holdings & Strategy

Incepted on January 15, 2024 and based in the U.S. with $256M AUM (assets under management), YMAX currently has a TTM yield of 16.38% and pays distributions monthly. The fund seeks income generation with a portion of the gains coming from call options strategies on the underlying holdings, in this case the suite of YieldMax ETFs, making the YMAX ETF a ""fund of funds"".

YMAX Holdings (Seeking Alpha)

Within the underlying holdings are primarily call options contracts and settled cash allocated to short-term treasury investments. The call options contract's strike price and date are made transparent to investors. The fund managers use two different covered call options strategies:

Traditional covered calls, where the fund sells a call option on an underlying security it owns. Synthetic covered call strategy, where the fund sells a call option on an underlying security it does not own. The fund will buy and sell the underlying holdings call and put options respectively at the same time to replicate the price movements of the underlying stock in spans of 6 months to 1 year.

Of note, the fund's TTM dividend yield of 16.38% is still growing and has not yet stabilized while the fund's yield on cost has remained relatively stable. Given the volatile nature of income investing options strategies, investors should not necessarily expect the funds yield to be stable as it will fluctuate along with the volitility of the underlying holdings.

YMAX Performance Study

Since the inception of YMAX, the fund has been keeping pace and at times even outpacing the the total return of the S&P 500, returning 14.58% vs. 15.96% respectively. Most of the returns of YMAX comes from the income distribution from the options strategy rather than the price return which has declined about 2% while the S&P 500 has run up over 15% YTD. From an income perspective, the fund is impressive thus far. While the returns of the market and YMAX are similar, a key difference are the majority of the returns of the S&P 500 are based on price return or ""paper gains"" while YMAX has are based on yield return. The fund has distributed a real cash return to shareholders which is an important characteristic when evaluating income generation of your investments. Of note, the beta of YMAX is about 1.75 vs. 1.00 for the S&P 500 benchmark, thus investors are taking on significantly more risk to get returns from YMAX.

Data by YCharts

Since YMAX is a ""fund of funds"" of the YieldMax family, I thought it would be interesting to plot each ETF's total returns based on the timeframe you could have owned one of them vs. YMAX. Several funds have returned more than 20% during this time, with YieldMax NVDA Option Income Strategy ETF (NVDY) and YieldMax MSTR Option Income Strategy ETF (MSTY) returning a staggering 82.6% and 79.8% respectively in the last ~6 months! Also, it's encouraging to see most funds generated a positive return and the four that did not had losses less than 15%, not something like 30, 40, or 50%. For YMAX, each holding carries around a 5% weight in the fund.

YMAX Holdings Total Return Since YMAX Inception (Seeking Alpha, Nicholas Bratto)

I thought it would also be interesting to plot each YMAX holding since their own inception dates to get a better idea of how something like YMAX could play out long-term. The data shows a similar trend, with more time lending to increased returns on the funds holding's total returns. However, one data point, and it only takes one, exemplifies why dazzling 20%+ returns should be cautioned when we see things like YieldMax AI Option Income Strategy ETF (AIYY) returning -22.7%.

YMAX Holdings Total Return Since Their Inception (Seeking Alpha, Nicholas Bratto)

If an investor is trying to assess each ETF's underlying price movements and hand pick them, even if 3 of them return 10%+, it only takes one -20%+ loss to wipe out all the gains. Or worse, just picking one ETF hoping to achieve an 80% return only to lose 20% of your money! The case for YMAX is really about seeing if the yield and the NAV are sustainable by holding the entire portfolio of their strategy to reduce the risk of NAV erosion. Based on the performance thus far, I would say it's doing a good job at that.

Outlook

Though I like how YMAX and it's underlying holdings have performed, I still rate this ETF as a ""Hold"" as I don't feel the strategy has had enough exposure to father time. The underlying holdings have only been exposed to the market's bull run since mid-2023. Seeing how the fund performs in market downturns or flat markets would give me more confidence in the sustainability of the total returns. Ultimately, I'm looking for this fund to return 8%+ sustainably for it to be considered an add to my portfolio or recommend it as a Buy. The fund carries a lot more risk and volatility in than funds targeting a 1% payout like Neos S&P 500(R) High Income ETF (SPYI) or NEOS NASDAQ-100(R) High Income ETF (QQQI), both of which I've also written on. For investors that already own or want to buy this fund, I recommend you reinvest a portion of the dividend. For example, pay yourself an 8% yield and reinvest the rest. This will prevent NAV erosion and grow your income stream long-term.","YMAX Holdings (Seeking Alpha)Within the underlying holdings are primarily call options contracts and settled cash allocated to short-term treasury investments.

Dear readers,

I recently shared my latest market outlook in an article on the S&P 500 (SPX) and explained why I continue to be bullish in the short term. In short, it's due to a combination of (1) inflation which is very likely to decline in the second half of the year as we work through the lag in shelter and auto insurance CPI, (2) consequently larger than expected Fed rate cuts, and (3) a likely liquidity boost around the election which, among other things, should come from (forced) lower QT by the Fed the draining of Janet Yellen's the treasury account.

I'm staying invested in the S&P 500, but I am also aware of several long-term risks that the broader market index faces. The S&P 500 is very concentrated to only a handful of very large companies, mostly from the tech sector. This, historically speaking, tends to result in poor performance, as in a competitive market companies rarely manage to keep the competitive advantages (in terms of growth and margins) that got them to that top position in the first place.

Broyhill research

Moreover, the index is currently on the expensive side with an average forward P/E of 20.5x, way above the 15x which is generally regarded as fairly valued and in line with recent history.

All and all I do think that having a part of your portfolio exposed to the S&P 500 is not a bad idea, but given the long-term risks I like to allocate an equally large part to more defensive stocks. These include undervalued value stocks with a large margin of safety, but also proven blue chip staple companies that have kept on paying and increasing their dividends for decades.

Procter & Gamble (NYSE:PG) is an example of such a company.

Last time I covered the stock was back in September. I concluded that the company had strong pricing power, which was an important factor back when the forward path of inflation seemed much less certain than now. But at a (somewhat) stretched valuation of 24.4x forward earnings which didn't leave much room for upside I issued a HOLD rating at $155 per share. Since then I have watched the stock return an RoR of 8.8% since, slightly above my forecasted annual total return of 6.5%. But the stock has underperformed the S&P 500 which returned a staggering 22.8% over the past 9 months.

David Ksir

Is PG a great business at a fair price?

Warren Buffet is knows for saying that he much prefers buying great businesses at a fair price than decent businesses at a great price. And I think that PG fits this very well.

First, let's go through what, in my opinion, makes Procter & Gamble a great business.

The company owns many very well known and recognized brands in beauty, grooming, home care and healthcare. These include brands such as Gillette, Old Spice, Oral B, and Pampers. The one thing that these brands have in common in that you need their products for your everyday life and you will likely buy them no matter the price. This is what gives the company fairly large pricing power and what has contributed to most of the organic sales growth, especially in inflationary periods.

Fiscal 2023, which covers the period from Q3 2022 to Q2 2023, was great for the company with 7% organic sales growth. Note that pricing contributed a full 9% to that growth, while mix contributed 1% and volume declined by 3%. This, of course, was largely driven by inflation and as inflation has come down significantly, it makes sense that PG's organic growth would come down as well. During the two most recent quarters, fiscal Q2 and Q3 2024, the company saw lower organic sales growth of 3-4%, led by the grooming segment which was the only segment that recorded double-digit growth.

PG IR

But what the company lost in revenue growth it made for in operational efficiencies as, excluding the effect of FX, PG's core gross margin increased by 400 basis points during the most recent quarter.

PG IR

With only one quarter left in the full fiscal year 2024 (to be reported on July 30th) and it is quite likely that the company will deliver on the 4-5% organic growth guidance which was issued back in September and which should translate into 10-11% growth in core EPS.

PG IR

And there are reasons to be positive beyond the fiscal 2024, with current consensus calling for annual EPS growth of 6-7% over the next two years driven by pricing, volume returning to normalized levels and a slowly (but surely) increasing market share.

Seeking Alpha

We could talk about the details all day, but the fact is that PG runs of the safest businesses in the world. And the word safe goes beyond their AA- balance sheet rating. They own the brands that you love and sell the products that need. That provides a significant moat. Moreover, they have proven to be very shareholder-friendly with 67 years of consecutive dividend increases and a strong share buyback program.

There is little doubt in my mind that PG's business will continue to thrive. The stock currently currently yields 2.44%. And we can reasonably expect the dividend to continue to grow in line with core EPS at 6-7% over the next couple of years. On top of the dividend, investors capture the aforementioned 6-7% core EPS growth, which already puts the investment around the 8% return threshold. The only thing left to do is to make sure that we don't overpay.

The stock trades at 25.2x earnings which isn't cheap, but frankly high quality never is. The 10-year long-term average for PG hovers closer to 22x which would indicate slight overvaluation. But the thing is that PG hasn't really been undervalued since 2018 when it traded at 18x earnings. Even during the Covid crash the stock only fell to 20x earnings very briefly and quickly recovered.

Fast Graphs

Personally, I think that valuing the stock at its 10-year historical average of 22x earnings makes sense. With expected 2024e earnings per share of $6.55, this corresponds to a price target of roughly $145 per share.

Risks

Procter & Gamble is a low volatility stock with a beta of just 0.57. As such, it is likely to experience lower highs and higher lows than the broader market.

My HOLD thesis, which in this case means simply staying away from the stock, has an opportunity cost. In particular, if the stock doesn't pull back, investors could easily be left behind as the stock continues on its nearly linear trajectory up and to the right. But since few stocks ever move in a straight line, I think that the risk is well worth it, especially for investors that (like me) are already mostly invested in the market and their cash is limited.

On a similar note, staying out has the obvious benefit of not participating in potential losses which PG will not be immune in case of a major market sell-off triggered by a black swan event.

Bottom Line

Proctor & Gamble is a great business at a fair price.

The stock is very likely to provide a total annual return of around 8%, while continuing to increase its now roughly 2.5% dividend yield. The current valuation is slightly on the expensive side, but anyone waiting for PG to pull back significantly will likely have to wait for a long time. I think, however, that waiting for a slight pull-back towards the 200-day moving average can be a smart move. I would only consider PG a BUY below $150 per share at which point it will be valued in line with historical average multiples and provide a reasonable margin of safety.

For these reasons I reiterate my HOLD rating here at $165 per share.","Procter & Gamble (NYSE:PG) is an example of such a company.

Predictions for Dividend Increases in July

There are 17 long-term dividend growth companies I expect to announce their annual increases in July. First, here is my prediction for two featured companies:

The Clorox Company (CLX) – 47 years of dividend growth

The last few years have been rough for some long-term dividend growth companies. V. F. Corporation and 3M both ended their run as dividend kings, cutting their dividends after 50 and 66 years, respectively. Unfortunately, there’s a decent chance that Clorox may join them as the company has been dealing with a lot of headwinds over the last several years. Earnings have fallen from $7.35 in 2020 to $1.20 in 2023, dropping 68% from 2022 to 2023 alone. The company is dealing with increased administrative and selling costs, along with higher commodity costs. The company also took large charges earlier this year due to closing its Argentinian business and for costs related to its pension plan in 2023.

Going forward, the company is expecting sales to continue to drop by low single digit percentage points. EPS growth expectations have fallen and the company is now expecting a EPS rebound to between $1.66 and $1.81. While this represents growth between 40 and 50% over 2023, even the high end would still leave the company with a payout ratio of over 260%. Using adjusted EPS as a marker (which ignores the one-time charges noted above), the payout ratio is a more reasonable but still high 80%. Given the difficulties the company is facing, the best income investors can expect this year is another 2% increase like last year’s. I think there’s a significant chance Clorox defers its dividend increase until business improves, as the company can continue to show annual dividend growth even if it skips its increase this year. If it does, it'll have until the end of 2025 to grow its payout to keep the dividend growth streak alive.

Prediction: 0 – 1.7% increase to $4.80 - $4.88

Predicted Forward Yield: 3.52 – 3.58%

Altria Group, Inc. (MO) – 54 years

With more than a half century of dividend growth under its belt, tobacco company Altria has been a go-to company for income investors. Brands like Marlboro cigarettes made the company a free cash flow giant for decades. Despite legal difficulties in the past, the company continues to diversify its core business to expand beyond cigarettes. Altria completed its acquisition of the NJOY vaping brand in June 2023 and earlier that year acquired a global license to certain JUUL-brand intellectual property.

The moves that Altria’s leadership have made are maintaining adjusted EPS and free cash flow in the low-to-mid single digit percentages. The company posted adjusted EPS growth of 2.3% in 2023 and is expecting another 2 – 4.5% growth in 2024. The company recently reaffirmed its goals for adjusted EPS growth in the mid-single digit percentages through 2028, from a base of $4.84 per share in 2022. The company also continues to buy back its shares and recently authorized a second one billion dollar buyback program after repurchasing 5% of its outstanding shares since 2019.

Altria has a 5-year compounded growth rate of 4.6%, which it should be able to maintain as long as it meets its EPS growth goals. Although the company didn’t quite meet that bar last year, investors can still expect a dividend increase around last year’s 4.3% boost.

Prediction: 3.1 – 4.6% increase to $4.04 - $4.10

Predicted Forward Yield: 8.87 – 9.00%

Here are my predictions for 15 other long-term dividend growth companies which should announce annual increases in July:

Company # Yrs Industry Prediction (%) New Annual Rate Community Bank System, Inc. (CBU) 31 Financial - Regional Banks 1.1% - 3.3% $1.82 - $1.86 The regional financial services company saw increasing revenues more than offset by growing employee costs, with adjusted EPS down 6% in 2023, followed by another 11% drop in the first quarter of 2024. Community Bank’s 4% dividend growth rate has been falling as the company has grown its annual dividend by just 4 cents over each of the last 4 years. Investors can expect another year of 4-cent annual growth. Predicted Forward Yield: 3.86 – 3.94% Cintas Corporation (CTAS) 39 Industrials - Specialty Business Services 13.3% - 16.3% $6.12 - $6.28 Business services company Cintas continues to hit it out of the park with earnings growth, which has allowed the company to build an envious dividend growth record. Over the last decade, the company has compounded its payout by more than 20% annually. Double-digit EPS growth is continuing: 2023 EPS were up 11.5% and Cintas has continually raised its guidance for 2024 earnings growth and is now projecting 15% EPS growth this year. This level of earnings growth won’t support another 20% dividend boost, but investors can expect an increase in the mid-teen percentages, similar to last year’s 17% boost. Predicted Forward Yield: 0.87 – 0.90% Community Trust Bancorp, Inc. (CTBI) 43 Financial - Regional Banks 3.3% - 5.4% $1.90 - $1.94 With small increases in loan charge-offs and nonperforming loans, the Kentucky-based regional bank saw EPS fall by 5% in 2023 and another 4% in the first quarter of 2024. Investors won’t see dividend growth ramp up, but with a payout ratio below 50% Community Trust can continue to boost its payout in the historical range of 4 – 5%. Predicted Forward Yield: 4.35 – 4.44% Duke Energy Corporation (DUK) 20 Utilities - Regulated Electric 2.0% - 2.9% $4.18 - $4.22 The North Carolina-based utility is seeing benefits from the population movement into the southeastern United States. The company ended 2023 with 5.5% adjusted EPS growth and is expecting another 5 – 9% growth in 2024. Going further, Duke reaffirmed its long term growth rate of 5 – 7% through 2028. However, the company has a decent debt load and is slowly growing the number of outstanding shares, which has resulted in 4 years of 8-cent annual dividend growth. So while the company could grow its dividend faster, I expect Duke Energy to continue its pattern. Predicted Forward Yield: 4.17 – 4.21% Greene County Bancorp, Inc. (GCBC) 10 Financial - Regional Banks 6.3% - 12.5% $0.34 - $0.36 The economic slowdown is hitting Greene County Bancorp. After posting years of earnings growth and splitting its stock 2-for-1 in March 2023, the upstate NY regional bank is saw EPS fall by 25% in the first three months of fiscal 2024, which ends on June 30, 2024. Investors will see payout growth slow from last year’s 14% increase, but can still expect a nice boost as Greene County begins its second decade of dividend growth. Predicted Forward Yield: 1.01 – 1.07% Landstar System, Inc. (LSTR) 10 Industrials - Integrated Freight & Logistics 6.1% - 9.1% $1.40 - $1.44 Logistics and transportation company Landstar is another company that’s suffering from the economic slowdown. After posting a 30% drop in revenue and 37% drop in EPS in 2023, business continued to be soft in the first quarter of 2024, driving EPS down a further 39%. The company has minimal debt and a low payout ratio below 20% which will allow an 11th straight year of dividend growth, but investors can expect growth to continue to slow, with payout increases in the high single digit percentages. Predicted Forward Yield: 0.76 – 0.78% McKesson Corporation (MCK) 16 Healthcare - Medical Distribution 12.1% - 15.3% $2.78 - $2.86 Healthcare company McKesson provides pharmacy services and distribution and wholesale medical supplies to a variety of healthcare providers. The company continues to post good results and generate good cash flow, which it uses to grow its payout and repurchase its shares. Since 2019, the company has compounded its dividend by nearly 10% annually and repurchased nearly 20% of its outstanding shares. With adjusted EPS growth of 6% in fiscal 2024 (which just concluded) and an expectation of 14 – 17% growth in fiscal 2025, investors can expect another dividend boost in the low to mid-teen percentages, similar to last year’s 15% increase. Predicted Forward Yield: 0.48 – 0.49% Mondelez International, Inc. (MDLZ) 10 Consumer Defensive - Confectioners 8.2% - 10.6% $1.84 - $1.88 The owner of many snack brands including the popular (to me, at least) Oreo and Chips Ahoy brands has compounded its payout by nearly 12% since beginning to grow its dividend a decade ago. The company continues to post good earnings growth, with adjusted EPS up 19% in 2023. While the company is expecting flat free cash flow in 2024, the company’s payout ratio of 50% leaves room for another dividend increase in the 10% range. Predicted Forward Yield: 2.81 – 2.87% Marsh & McLennan Companies, Inc. (MMC) 15 Financial - Insurance Brokers 15.5% - 19.7% $3.28 - $3.40 Consulting company Marsh & McLennan has compounded dividends at 11% over the last decade and routinely boosts its payout by double digits. The company blew away expectations with last year’s increase, rewarding investors with a 20% jump to an annualized $2.84. With Marsh & McLennan posting 17% earnings growth in 2023, the company is poised to keep rewarding investors. I expect the company’s next increase to be close to last year’s boost. Predicted Forward Yield: 1.56 – 1.61% PPG Industries, Inc. (PPG) 52 Basic Materials - Specialty Chemicals 6.2% - 9.2% $2.76 - $2.84 Earnings growth has picked up at the paint and coatings company, as PPG has implemented a cost savings program while passing on higher selling prices to its customers. Adjusted EPS grew 27% in 2023 and are expected to grow another 10% in 2024. So while dividend growth slowed to 5% last year, investors can expect it to pick up closer to the company’s average growth rate of 6 – 8%. Predicted Forward Yield: 2.19 – 2.26% Republic Services, Inc. (RSG) 20 Industrials - Waste Management 6.5% - 8.4% $2.28 - $2.32 After posting slow dividend growth over the last 5 years, environmental services company Republic Services boosted its dividend by 8% last year. Investors can expect continued good dividend growth going forward – adjusted EPS grew 14% in 2023 and are expected to grow another 6% this year. I expect another boost similar to last year’s increase. Predicted Forward Yield: 1.17 – 1.19% The J. M. Smucker Company (SJM) 26 Consumer Defensive - Packaged Foods 4.7% - 5.7% $4.44 - $4.48 J. M. Smucker began its 2nd quarter century of dividend growth last year with a 4% increase, slightly below the long-term dividend growth rate of 5 – 6%. The company returned to earnings growth in fiscal 2024 (which ended April 30th), posting 11% growth to nearly $10 a share. Unfortunately, Smucker is expecting impacts from inflation next year, with sales up 10% but earnings flat. Given the mixed message, I expect dividend growth at the food company to only return to its historical average. Predicted Forward Yield: 4.07 – 4.11% Stanley, Black & Decker, Inc. (SWK) 56 Industrials - Tools & Accessories 1.2% - 2.5% $3.28 - $3.32 2023 was a rebuilding year for the tool manufacturer, with the company investing in cost-cutting measures in response to global inflation. With adjusted EPS down 70% from 2022, it’s not surprising that last year’s dividend increase was a minimal 1% boost. The company seems to be making its way past the storms, though, and is expecting adjusted EPS to rebound to between $3.50 and $4.50 – almost a complete return to 2022’s adjusted EPS of $4.62. Despite the optimistic projections, I think the company will play it safe and that investors will see a second year of slow dividend growth. Predicted Forward Yield: 4.11 – 4.16% Skyworks Solutions, Inc. (SWKS) 9 Technology - Semiconductors 5.9% - 8.8% $2.88 - $2.96 Earnings have fallen since 2021 for the semiconductor company, with EPS down 24% and sales down 13% in 2023. Sales and earnings are continuing to fall in the first half of 2024, meaning that investors can expect dividend growth to continue to decelerate from last year’s 10% increase to the high single digit percentages. Predicted Forward Yield: 2.70 – 2.78% Click to enlarge

Summary

There were some very nice increases in June, among them double-digit boosts from Casey’s General Stores, grocer Kroger, and UnitedHealth. We also saw a good 8.5% increase from heavy equipment manufacturer Caterpillar. Conversely, we saw two small increases from Target and John Wiley & Sons – mostly to just keep their dividend growth streaks alive.

After a slow June, things will pick up in July with 17 companies announcing increases. Several regional banks should announce their annual increases, including Greene County Bancorp, Community Bank System, and Community Trust Bancorp. Double-digit increases are expected from business services company Cintas, healthcare company McKesson, and consulting company Marsh & McLennan. We should also see a nice increase from snack company Mondelez and a mid-single digit increases from food company J. M. Smucker and tobacco company Altria. Stanley, Black & Decker should announce a small increase, while The Clorox Company may skip its annual increase this year.

Investment thesis

Celsius Holdings, Inc. (NASDAQ:CELH) presents a compelling investment opportunity in the burgeoning functional energy drink market. With innovative products and a robust distribution partnership with PepsiCo (PEP), Celsius is well-positioned for significant growth both in the U.S. and especially internationally. I believe that despite some recent sales slowdowns, the company's strategic expansions and strong financial health provide a solid foundation for future gains. Due to the recent share price decline of approximately 40%, the company could provide a fair risk-reward trade-off for a bit more risk-taking investor.

A short introduction to the company

Celsius Holdings is a rapidly growing company in the functional energy drink market, both in the U.S. and internationally. Celsius develops and distributes functional energy drinks with innovative, clinically proven formulas. Its flagship product, CELSIUS, caters to active lifestyles and is available in ready-to-drink and powder forms. The company also offers CELSIUS Essentials in 16-ounce cans.

CELH sales by region (Quarterly Report)

Celsius products are sold across various major U.S. retail channels, and international sales began in 2023. In 2022, Celsius entered a significant distribution agreement with PepsiCo, making Pepsi its primary distributor in the U.S. and involving a $550 million investment from PEP. The lion's share of its wholesale customers is made of two companies: Pepsi and Costco.

Future trends of the energy drink market

The energy drink market in 2024 is shaped by four key trends: health and wellness, innovation, channel dynamics, and instant hydration. Health-conscious consumers increasingly seek high-caffeine, low-sugar, and functional beverages. According to NielsenIQ, ""health-conscious consumers are driving demand for energy drinks with functional benefits"". Celsius aligns with this trend by offering clinically proven, innovative formulas designed to support active lifestyles. Innovation remains crucial, with new product launches featuring unique ingredients and functional claims. Celsius capitalizes on this by continuously introducing new flavors and product lines, such as the CELSIUS Essentials line.

Channel dynamics are also important, with different sales channels showing varying growth rates and consumer behaviors, affecting marketing strategies. Celsius' strategic distribution through major retail channels and online platforms ensures broad consumer reach. Additionally, the rising competition from instant hydration products pushes energy drink brands to differentiate through targeted marketing and unique value propositions.

By focusing on health benefits, continuous innovation, strategic distribution, and effective marketing, in my opinion, Celsius is well-positioned to leverage these market trends and drive growth in the competitive energy drink industry not just in the U.S. but internationally as well.

Reality check of Q1 management expectations

For the rest of 2024, Celsius Holdings' management is optimistic about the company's growth trajectory and market expansion. In the company's Q1 earnings call, they expected significant gains from the ongoing shelf resets, which are projected to be fully completed by July, aiming to achieve double and triple facings in stores. This initiative is anticipated to enhance product visibility and availability, thereby boosting sales. However, recent developments indicate that the company's sales growth has slowed, with Nielsen data showing a dip in market share to 10.5% and a pricing decrease of 7.2% year-over-year.

In my view, the partnership with Pepsi is a critical element in their strategy, with a new incentive program designed to align both companies' priorities and drive Celsius toward becoming the top energy drink brand globally. Yet, Pepsi's inventory reductions in Q2, amounting to $20-30 million, have led analysts to lower their revenue estimates for Celsius, impacting near-term outlooks. However, I also believe that the long-term growth prospect of the company is still in line with my expectations (25-28% CAGR for the next 4-5 years) but many analysts initially expected a higher growth rate of 30-34% in 2025 and 2026 which seems a bit high after the recent developments.

Innovative product launches, such as new flavors and the CELSIUS Essentials line, are expected to continue driving category growth and attracting new consumers. John Fieldly - Chairman and CEO also highlighted the importance of their increased sales staff and key accounts team:

""And already this year, we've increased our sales and key accounts team by approximately 85%. By the end of this year, we're expecting to have three times as many sales staff compared to this time last year, supporting our growth and the opportunities we see ahead.""

International growth remains a focus, with promising performance in new markets like Canada, Australia, France, Ireland, New Zealand, and the UK. In addition, with the French market, they will get access to the whole EU market with more than 400 million consumers. The European energy drink market is expected to grow at around 7% per year for the next 5 years, which Celsius can capitalize on.

Financially, they aim to maintain high gross margins by leveraging supply chain efficiencies and controlling costs, despite fluctuations in raw material prices. However, analysts have adjusted their estimates due to inventory issues and market challenges, with some cautioning that future market share gains will be harder to achieve. Overall, while management remained confident in the first quarter earnings call in achieving robust revenue growth and market share gains through strategic initiatives and partnerships, recent trends suggest a need for cautious optimism as they navigate these challenges.

International growth story

Celsius Holdings is aggressively expanding internationally, aiming to enter the UK, Ireland, France, Australia, and New Zealand by the end of the year, alongside its recent launch in Canada.

CELH international growth (Investor Presentation)

This expansion strategy, despite its association with PepsiCo, involves partnerships with regional distributors like Suntory Beverage in the UK due to its strong presence in gyms, a key entry point for energy drinks. This international push is expected to pressure margins due to the lack of established scale and manufacturing infrastructure outside the U.S., leading to higher costs and investments. I realistically expect that the highest gross margin to date (51.2%) which investors saw in Q1 will decline below 50% in the next quarters. However, the company benefits from higher-than-anticipated brand awareness, boosted by social media. CEO John Fieldly emphasized a methodical approach to international growth, replicating their successful U.S. strategy. PepsiCo serves as the exclusive distributor in Canada, while Suntory Beverage handles distribution in the UK and Ireland.

Valuation

Celsius Holdings' valuation underscores its dynamic growth potential but also highlights the market's volatility and associated risks. In my opinion, the main risk factor for the company is its growth prospects because the market is counting on aggressive growth within the upcoming years. Although, in the last month, these slowing growth expectations have been reflected in its stock price. I expect that CELH can reach a market cap of $32-33 billion, reflecting a roughly 14% IRR based on a 25% CAGR over the next five years. Celsius trades at quite a high TTM P/E ratio of 62.8x and forward P/E of 52.8x, which are significantly above Monster's 31.6x and 28.1x, respectively. This disparity suggests a potential overvaluation, albeit justified by Celsius' rapid revenue growth of ~37% in the last quarter, outpacing Monster's ~14%.

CELH revenue estimates according to the author (Alpha Spread)

I believe that the company's financial robustness, marked by substantial cash reserves of $880 million and zero debt, provides a solid foundation for its growth initiatives. Moreover, its FCF generation of ~$130 million (last quarter) and high gross margins enhance its financial health. However, we need to take into consideration the near-term challenges from inventory adjustments by PEP and a softening demand across the energy drink category.

Despite these hurdles, the long-term growth trajectory for Celsius remains promising to me, driven by innovative product launches and strategic market expansions. Analysts project a potential upside with a long-term average price target of $83.43, suggesting significant growth if the company continues to capitalize on its market opportunities and manage its valuation expectations effectively. Thus, while Celsius' valuation appears steep, its growth potential and financial strength position it as an attractive, but risky growth investment.

Other factors to consider before buying in

Let's recall that PepsiCo acquired an 8.5% stake in Celsius Holdings in 2022 at an adjusted price of $25 per share. Given Celsius' growing popularity and potential in international markets, PepsiCo might consider additional investments at around $50 per share. This move could bolster PepsiCo's portfolio, especially as it struggles with organic growth in its North American beverage portfolio. CELH remains a fast-growing, significant brand within PepsiCo's distribution network, potentially making it a future acquisition target. With CELH's market cap just under $14 billion compared to PepsiCo's $225 billion, a takeover remains plausible, especially if CELH's valuation compresses amid PepsiCo's muted growth in North America. Of course, at the moment it is pure speculation, but I believe a good investor tries to cover all the angles. One more interesting part is that after CELH's significant share price drop, the short interest has started to decrease. Short interest on CELH stands at 8.6% of the total float, which is lower than it stood in March (10.6%) or the beginning of June (9.2%).

Summary

In conclusion, while Celsius Holdings faces near-term challenges including inventory adjustments and a competitive market landscape, its long-term growth potential remains robust. The company's innovative product lineup, strategic partnership with PepsiCo, and aggressive international expansion position it well to capitalize on the growing functional energy drink market. Financially strong with significant cash reserves and no debt, Celsius is equipped to navigate market fluctuations and pursue strategic initiatives. Although, the current valuation could seem high if we only take into account the company's current status, the potential for substantial revenue growth and potential strategic acquisition by PepsiCo provide a compelling investment case in my opinion.","HandmadePicturesInvestment thesisCelsius Holdings, Inc.

FS KKR Stock: Outperformed BDC Peers Recently

FS KKR Capital (NYSE:FSK) stock has performed relatively well, notching a 1Y total return of more than 20%. However, that pales in comparison to its business development peers, represented in the VanEck BDC Income ETF (BIZD). Accordingly, BIZD delivered a total 1Y total return of more than 26%, even though FSK still trades at a relatively attractive discount of 19% against its NAV per share. The discount has narrowed since my previous bullish FSK update in early April 2024.

FSK/BIZD price chart (weekly, medium-term, adjusted for dividends) (TradingView)

My previous article highlighted concerns about FS KKR's non-accruals challenges. Back then, FSK was valued at a wider discount of 22% to its NAV per share. Based on FSK's Q1 earnings release in May 2024, it seems like FSK management has alleviated investor concerns. FSK's outperformance against BIZD since its February 2024 lows suggests that the market has likely priced in steep pessimism, potentially helping FSK outperform moving forward.

FS KKR: Non-Accruals Still A Concern

Observant FS KKR investors are likely aware of FSK's relatively high non-accruals in its portfolio. Accordingly, FSK registered 4.2% of non-accruals (6.5% based on amortized cost) against its portfolio fair value in Q1. It indicates a notable improvement from the 5.5% non-accrual metric (based on fair value) against FSK's portfolio in Q4FY2023. Consequently, I assess that the market seems satisfied with management's ability to mitigate these challenges.

Management provided more insights at FSK's Q1 earnings call into some of the efforts undertaken to help improve FSK's portfolio resilience. Accordingly, these include improvements in the Global Jet situation, recapitalization of converted second-lien loans for Witter, and restructured first-lien debt. In addition, FSK also reported that KBS completed a ""full consensual restructuring."" As a result, it ""resulted in equitization of a portion of the non-accruing second out loan and FSK and other lenders taking control of the company.""

In addition, management underscores FSK's firm commitment to assure investors about its focus on rectifying the non-accruals challenges. FSK articulated it has a ""dedicated restructuring and workout team led by Lauren Kruger."" Moreover, FSK also called upon assistance and expertise from KKR Advisors to help with the KBS restructuring. Consequently, it should help quell investor pessimism about a worsening impact.

FSK NAV per share and NII per share estimates % (TIKR)

Notwithstanding FSK's recent outperformance against its peers, Wall Street is still relatively cautious. Analysts have downgraded FSK's estimates, suggesting FSK's NII per share could decline in 2024. As a result, it would likely impede FSK's ability to lift its NAV per share markedly, justifying the need for the market to reflect caution on its valuation.

In addition, the highlighted challenges raise questions about whether FSK could sustain its highly attractive dividend payout over the next two years.

FSK: Valuation Is Still Very Cheap

FSK Quant Grades (Seeking Alpha)

While investor concerns about FS KKR's non-accrual challenges are justified, FSK's valuation remains relatively attractive. Seeking Alpha Quant assigns FSK an ""A+"" valuation grade, reflecting significant pessimism.

FSK's forward NII per share multiple of 7x is well below its financial sector peers. It's also below its 10Y average and capital markets peers' median of 8.6x. In other words, the market isn't dumb. While the possibility of FSK's supplemental or special dividends could be curtailed, FSK's forward dividend yield of more than 14% has likely reflected such risks.

Is FSK Stock A Buy, Sell, Or Hold?

FSK price chart (weekly, medium-term, adjusted for dividends) (TradingView)

In addition, FSK's price action (adjusted for dividends) has remained robust. Since bottoming in February 2024, FSK's buyers have returned, helping to sustain its uptrend bias.

I've also not assessed red flags in FSK's price action behooving significant caution. Therefore, the market may have baked in substantial pessimism in FS KKR's non-accruals challenges earlier in 2024. Given the potentially lower NII per share accretion, a considerable valuation re-rating might be an uphill task in the near term. However, FSK's risk/reward still seems favorable, as highlighted by its constructive price action and appealing valuation.

Market Recap

The first half of 2024 went nearly as well as the first half of 2023 for the S&P 500, with the index ETF (SPY) returning 15.2% including dividends, compared to 16.8% in the first half of last year. Once again, leadership was narrow, with only 2 of the 11 sectors beating the average. As measured by the total return of the Select Sector SPDRS, Communications Services (XLC) returned 18.5% and Technology (XLK) returned 17.9%. The dispersion was not quite as wide as last year, however, as two other sectors managed double-digit returns: Energy (XLE) at 10.5% and Financials (XLF) 10.2%.

Seeking Alpha

Another four sectors had returns between 7% and 10%. Only one sector had a negative return so far this year, Real Estate (XLRE) at -2.5%, with Consumer Discretionary (XLY) and Materials (XLB) in low single digits.

Seeking Alpha

Growth outperformed Value even more than in 1H 2023, although most of this outperformance came in the last two months. The iShares S&P 500 Value Fund (IVE) returned 5.6% for the half year compared to 23.5% for the Growth Fund (IVW).

Seeking Alpha

Market cap was once again a big performance driver. The Vanguard Mega Cap Growth ETF (MGK) returned 21.3%, compared to only 5.8% for the SPDR MidCap ETF (MDY) and 1.6% for the small cap iShares Russell 2000 ETF (IWM). As with the other charts we've seen so far, the outperformance of the mega caps picked up during May and June.

Seeking Alpha

Within fixed income, investment grade bonds were impacted by increasing interest rates as the 10-year US Treasury Note yield (US10Y) rose from under 4% at the start of the year to 4.7% in late April before coming back down to 4.36% at the end of June. The iShares Core U.S. Aggregate Bond ETF (AGG) returned -0.7% in 1H 2024. The Investment Grade Corporate Bond Fund (LQD) returned -1.4%. Riskier segments of the bond market did better as their spreads narrowed vs. treasuries. High coupon rates were also a driver of return for these securities. The High Yield ETF (HYG) returned 2.3% and the Preferred ETF (PFF) returned 3.8%.

Seeking Alpha

The first four months of 2024 played out largely as I expected at the end of last year: modest but decent equity returns in the single digits but with broad participation from all sectors. This would be driven by a higher for longer interest rate environment with inflation slowly falling to 2%. This is not a bad thing for stocks if accompanied by decent GDP growth of 2% or higher. The Federal Reserve has come to believe this outlook, with the June 2024 projections showing 2.1% GDP growth, 2.6% inflation, and a 5.1% Fed Funds Rate (1 rate cut) in 2024. The Fed is now more in line with my outlook than they were in December 2023 when they were looking for only 1.4% GDP growth, 2.4% inflation, and a 4.6% Fed Funds Rate (3 cuts) in 2024.

During May and June 2024 however, the market began to price in a slowing growth scenario with the falling 10-year rate over this period. The mega cap growth stocks outperform in this environment because they are considered the last stocks to cut growth forecasts and because lower interest rates make high future earnings worth more when discounted to present value.

Can performance broaden back out in the second half of the year, or are we back to a 2023 scenario where we should just own the top 7 mega caps and forget about the rest of the market? While the mega caps are not excessively expensive based on earnings and growth, I am reluctant to believe they have to lead the market all the time. Also, the presidential debate has raised the possibility of a political change that causes value stocks and small caps to do better in the second half as they did in 2016.

Portfolio Performance

My portfolio was neck-and neck with the S&P 500 through April but fell back in the last couple months as mega caps outperformed. My total return was 8.2% in 1H 2024, underperforming the S&P 6.9%. My ending asset allocation was 78.0% equities, 16.2% fixed income and preferreds, and 5.8% cash. That marks a shift of 1.7% out of equities, 2.5% out of fixed income, and 4.2% into cash compared to the allocation at year-end 2023. As I will discuss below, I trimmed more positions than usual in the first half of 2024 and am satisfied to earn high rates on cash while waiting to redeploy these funds.

As for investment income, I had a yield of 1.3% (non-annualized) in 1H 2024 based on starting portfolio value. This is higher than the 1H SPY yield of 0.7%. Higher cash balances helped to drive this yield, as well as dividend increases in stocks and closed end municipal bond funds. My portfolio income in total dollars was a healthy 18% above 1H 2023 levels. Looking forward, my projected yield for 2024 is now 2.9%, better than the 2.6% I expected at the start of the year.

Largest Holdings

My top 10 common stock holdings make up 56.5% of my total portfolio. I made no trades in any of the holdings currently on the list, except for reinvesting dividends. Since the end of 2023, Albemarle (ALB) fell off the list as the lithium market failed to recover from its big decline in late 2023. Carrier Global Corp. (CARR) is new to the top 10, but not to my portfolio. I have held it since the spinoff from United Technologies (RTX) and added to it in 2020 at much lower prices. The company is transitioning to a pure HVAC business, selling its fire, security, and refrigeration divisions. It is still valued attractively vs. peers even after its big increase in April.

Author Spreadsheet

My top 5 fixed income holdings now make up 8.8% of my total portfolio. Since year-end 2023, I have sold RLJ Lodging Trust Preferred Series A (RLJ.PR.A). I believe the 7.8% coupon is safe, but it feels late in the cycle for the hotel business, and the REIT has more debt than usual coming due in the next few years it will have to refinance at higher rates. I do not mind sacrificing a little yield to earn returns on cash while I look for other opportunities. Cash holdings, including money markets (SWVXX) are now a high allocation relative to my history, at 5.8% of the portfolio.

I also swapped pairs of close but not ""substantially similar"" securities for tax loss harvesting purposes. I sold my full position in Nuveen Quality Muni Income Fund (NAD) and bought its AMT-free relative (NEA). All the leveraged Nuveen muni closed end funds are now overdistributing relative to earnings, so I will consider swapping into an unlevered fund when it looks like rates may increase again. I sold the portion of my Synchrony Preferred Series A (SYF.PR.A) that I bought for $25 around the IPO in 2019 and swapped into the recently issued Series B (OTC:SYF.PR.B). The newer preferred has a higher yield but has a coupon that resets every 5 years. I may look to swap back out of this well before the next reset in 2029 if it looks like rates will be lower.

The Micron (MU) bond in 5th place is new to the list but not my portfolio. It is part of my bond ladder that now extends from 2025-2034 with similar size holdings maturing each year.

Top And Bottom Performers

My third best performer so far this year was Qualcomm (QCOM), with a return of 38.9%. I consider it a secondary beneficiary of the AI trend. The phone upgrade cycle this year is expected to be more robust than recent years as consumer demand is high for AI-enabled phones. Qualcomm is also getting into the PC market where a similar dynamic is playing out.

The second-best performer was Western Midstream Partners (WES), up 40.7% YTD. I have been a fan of this midstream partnership for a long time with its positions in the Permian basin as well as Colorado and Wyoming. It appears the big dividend raise earlier this year finally got the rest of the market interested. The partnership now yields 8.8% and the distribution still looks well-covered by free cash flow.

The best performer of 2024 so far has been Constellation Energy (CEG), returning 72.0% in the first half of the year. This independent power producer is in the sweet spot with growing demand for electricity in general with the growth of data centers. It also benefits from its predominantly nuclear focus, as government subsidies and customer demand favor power with zero associated CO2 emissions.

The third worst performer of the year was Toro (TTC), down 12.6% before I sold it. The stock was hurt by a short seller's report featuring concerns about inventory build-up in the dealer channel. The company addressed most of these fears with their 2Q results and the stock recovered. Still, Seeking Alpha Quant Ratings for Toro have been bouncing between Hold and Sell with the current rating at 2.89. My sale looks like a mistake right now, but I agree with the ratings system that it is still expensive. I would consider getting back in in the $70s.

The second worst performer was Warner Bros. Discovery (WBD), with a personal return of -23.9% based on my trade timing. I doubled my position in February at $8.44 but later did some tax loss harvesting, selling the shares I acquired before and in the spinoff from AT&T (T). I still trust management to turn things around and they have already demonstrated cost and debt reduction. They are still in a difficult business with a lot of competition, however.

The worst performer of the year has been Albemarle (ALB), down -33.1% based on my trade timing. I got it wrong in March when I expected lithium prices to turn. Instead, they fell back to new lows in June, along with the share price. I sold my entire position in June at $96.10 along with a short-term holding in the preferred shares (ALB.PR.A). The shares are still a little below where I sold them, and I would consider getting back in around $87. The Seeking Alpha Quant Rating System is still bearish on the stock, with a Sell rating of 1.55.

Special Situations

I entered two special situation investments so far this year. The first was in CVR Partners (UAN), a Midwest US producer of nitrogen fertilizer associated with CVR Energy (CVI). The partnership became the subject of M&A speculation in March when large owner Icahn Enterprises (IEP) and CVI stated they would look at strategic options. Whether or not a transaction happens, the partnership is a high-yielding but variable dividend payer. Barring a huge collapse in fertilizer price which I think is unlikely, the partnership can continue to deliver forward yields around 10%.

The second special situation was Paramount Global Corp. (PARA) which became the subject of takeover drama in the second quarter. Paramount's unusual share structure, with voting shares (PARAA) predominantly held by Shari Redstone through her National Amusements business ended up being an obstacle to a deal. Looking forward, Paramount will probably have to turn around its operations and improve its high-debt, low free cash flow situation before the stock will recover. I believe it is not as far along in that process as WBD, so I will probably wait to see some signs of improvement before selling PARA and swapping back into WBD.

Other Trades

I made more trades than usual in the first half of 2024, most of which have been addressed. Toro and Albemarle, while terrible over the past year, still produced large gains for me over the entire holding period. This triggered the tax loss harvesting moves discussed above. Time will tell if I would have been better of just holding these stocks and waiting for improvement.

For completeness, the only other trades not already mentioned were two small ones. I day traded some options (synthetic short) in AMC Entertainment (AMC) during one of the meme stock spikes in May for a small gain. I also added to my position in an individual muni bond, Cleveland / Cuyahoga County Port Authority 3.125% due 2039 (CUSIP: 18610RCA0) at a price well below par.

Lessons Learned

Lesson 1 is ""own it, don't trade it"". This applies not just to Jim Cramer's positions in Apple (AAPL) and Nvidia (NVDA), but to any company with a decent track record and competent management over the long-term. The short report on Toro and the lithium price crash for Albemarle are serious issues that can impact share prices but might not be reasons to sell a long-term holding as long as there is a good chance of eventual recovery. It's hard to get out before most of the damage has been done and even harder to get back in at the right time before the market starts pricing in the recovery.

Lesson 2 should be obvious but is important to restate for investors who pick individual stocks. The less your portfolio looks like the market, the less likely it is to have returns similar to the market over short periods. I saw this in 2022-2023, when I beat the market the first year, underperformed the second year, but had similar returns to the S&P over the two-year period. The lack of mega cap stocks caused this divergence then, as it did in April and May 2024. Instead of getting overly critical, it is worth remembering conditions could change and bring your style back into outperformance.

Outlook

I continue to expect decent economic conditions for the rest of 2024 similar to what I stated at the start of the year: GDP growth around 2% with inflation getting back to 2% but slowly. The Fed will likely follow their latest projection and cut the Fed Funds rate just once this year. Longer term rates could stabilize around current levels or even creep back up toward 4.5%-5% on the 10-year as the market begins to believe in a higher neutral interest rate.

I don't like to let politics influence my investment outlook too heavily, as many expectations are quickly priced into the market. Unexpected trends can influence return, however. We saw this in 2016 as the market increasingly priced in a Republican victory in the second half of the year, then reacted even more after the November election on the prospects of lower taxes and less regulation. This helped small cap and value stocks outperform.

2016 Returns (Seeking Alpha)

A similar setup could happen in the second half off 2024 with betting markets increasingly reflecting a Republican victory. This pattern could revert to the mean in 2025 and beyond as almost no politicians ever fully deliver the promises they ran on. However, through the end of this year, a portfolio like mine that is smaller-cap and more weighted to value could outperform.

Rena Sherbill: Jonah Lupton, who runs Fundamental Growth Investor, which is one of our newest investing groups on Seeking Alpha and might I add, one of our most well-received and one of our highest rated thus far. So, super excited to have Jonah on the show.

Jonah Lupton: Thanks for having me. I appreciate it.

RS: Yeah, it's great to have you on. I'd love it if we just started at the beginning, or maybe somewhere in the middle in terms of your narrative. Let's introduce you to our audience, some on Seeking Alpha already know you. How would you articulate your journey thus far in the investing world, and what brought you to Seeking Alpha? And how did you name your investing group, Fundamental Growth Investor? Let's start in those places.

JL: Okay. So, I mean, my investing journey goes back more than 20 years. My father was a long time Wall Street veteran. When I decided to go to college, I was actually crazy enough to pick premed as my major. And then once I got into premed, I realized that it was not for me. And I quickly fell into finance and economics, did very, very well. I'm not surprised. I've always loved numbers.

I excelled in those subjects in high school, graduated college, went to Morgan Stanley, then went to Smith Barney. Then when I left Smith Barney, those two firms actually got together, they merged. And then I worked for a couple of other investment banks, private banks in Boston. Then I actually took a 10-year break from running client capital.

So when I was at those firms, I was on the wealth management side. So I was running, call it, $0.5 billion of client capital, high net worth foundations, non-profits, et cetera. Ran a couple of tech startups, was out in Silicon Valley for a little while, and then came back during the pandemic.

And when everything got shut down, that included the company that I was running at the time. So naturally, I decided to get on Twitter and start talking about stocks and investing, ended up launching a Substack newsletter, ended up launching my Seeking Alpha service, and thousands of subscribers later, here we are.

So I run a couple of different services just on those two platforms. I've been running Seeking Alpha, I think now for about 18 months. I think I'm in the top 10 now. So people seem to like my service. I am definitely a growth investor, but I don't pigeonhole myself into just growth stocks. I mean, I'm trying to make as much money as I possibly can.

So if that means I end up owning some undervalued value stocks or cyclicals, that's fine too. I have an energy stock in my portfolio, which is definitely not growth, but it's a company that's up almost 300% in the last few years, or actually last two years since I started buying it.

So definitely a growth investor. I would say probably about 20% of my portfolio is small caps and then the rest is probably split up between large caps, mid caps. So I'm looking for growth stocks with the best fundamentals at the most compelling valuations. That's kind of how I describe it.

I'm looking for stocks that have at least 50% upside in the next two years and at least 100% upside in the next three or four years. Most of my stocks end up doubling much faster than three or four years because I'm finding them when they're cheap and I'm picking the right entry points and exit points.

So, for instance, I got into CELSIUS (CELH), CELSIUS energy drinks, which a lot of people are familiar with. I started buying that stock in May of 2020 at $3 and exited my position a couple of weeks ago in the mid-$80s. So that turned out to be a very, very profitable position for me for the last three or four years, and I'm looking for stocks like that.

Super Micro (SMCI) was another stock that I found last year. When NVIDIA (NASDAQ:NVDA) last May had their big breakout gap-up earnings report as they sort of unveiled the H100 to the world, NVIDIA was up 25% or 30% that day. I actually started buying NVIDIA the next day.

I've done pretty well with NVIDIA, even though it was a little bit late to the party, but I started to think what other companies might benefit from these H100s and this new AI chip revolution, found Super Micro did more due diligence, did a deep dive on the company. I started building my position under $200. And I've now sold about 90% of that position at an average price of somewhere over $1,000.

So, I mean, there's plenty of stocks out there that people just aren't paying attention to, or they don't understand the story, or they don't have -- they don't recognize the catalyst that are coming up and those catalysts are not properly being priced into the stock and the fundamentals.

So typically, I'm going to own 20 to 25 core holdings, which are positioned typically over 3%. I will go up to 10%, 15%, 20% in a position. Typically, most of that over 10% is capital appreciation. I'm very sensitive about not trimming my winners too aggressively because if I catch them right, I want to ride them for two, three years, four years, five years like I did with Celsius.

So I don't want to get too aggressive with trimming unless the valuation has really gotten too frothy and the multiples gotten too expanded.

I also have five or 10, sometimes 15 swing trades in my portfolio. So those are typically positions 1% to 2% each. There are stocks that I like, I like the company, the fundamentals are strong, but there's something that just, I don't like enough to not have me build a bigger position.

So, for instance, well, Coinbase (COIN) actually got stopped out this week, but a stock like Coinbase, it's my exposure to crypto. I have zero interest in owning crypto coins or any of that stuff. But Coinbase is obviously a platform that allows crypto transactions.

So if I want to play crypto, Coinbase is kind of the only way to do it, but delusion and SBC is just horrendous at Coinbase, makes it impossible for me to have a larger position in that stock.

Same with, I got into Snapchat (SNAP) today as a swing trade. I won't own that stock as a core position for a bunch of reasons, but I'm more than willing to have it as a swing trade, as the technicals breakout, because I'm more of a breakout trader.

The third piece of my investment strategy, so 20 to 25 core holdings, anywhere from 3% to 20%; swing trades, 5 to 15, anywhere from 1 to 2%; and I'll own those as long as the fundamentals and the technicals remain strong.

So right now some of my swing trades are Sea Limited (SE), Robinhood (HOOD), Novo Nordisk (NVO), Palantir (PLTR), AppFolio (APPF), Reddit (RDDT), Snapchat, Amazon (AMZN). So strong companies, but I just don't like them enough to have them as core positions, so they work as swing trades.

And then the third piece, which is really important, which I've gotten pretty good at is hedging. So I typically short the index ETFs as my hedges and I'll overweight whichever index ETFs are showing relative weakness. So there's typically four that I use: it's the (QQQ)s, which is the NASDAQ; it's (IWM), which is the Russell 2000; it's (ARKK), which is the ARK Innovation ETF; (FFTY), which is the IBD Innovator ETF.

So this year, my heaviest hedges were IWM and ARKK. So I typically run my portfolio on margin. Now disclosure, margin is risky, margin is scary, don't do it unless you know what you're doing. And I would only use margin when I'm using hedges.

So I'm typically running my longs at anywhere from 100% to 160%. So 40% to 60% of that is on margin, but I'm using a lot of hedges. So my net exposure is somewhere between 80% to 85%, maybe as high as 90% in the good market, maybe as low as 70% or 75%. If things are getting kind of dicey in the markets, or we're going into a big earnings week or a big macro week with like CPI, PPI, jobs, that's where I want to have a little bit less exposure. And then I trade around those hedges during the day.

But this year, if you go and you look at the performance, ARKK is still down, I think 15% year-to-date, IWM is basically flat on the year. I forgot to mention this, probably should have started with this. I'm up 150% year-to-date in my portfolio. I was up 134% last year. So this year, my longs have acted very, very well for me.

Super Micro was up 350% at the highs where I was doing most of my trimming. Celsius was up 80% or 90% when I did most of my trimming and I'm out of Celsius now, like I said. And then I probably have another five or six stocks in my portfolio that are up anywhere from 80% to 150% year-to-date, companies like TransMedics (TMDX), Aspen Aerogels (ASPN), companies that I still like, but companies that have done very well this year.

So my longs have done incredibly well and my hedges really haven't hurt me at all. I've actually made money on my IWM and my ARKK hedges. My QQQ hedge has been a little bit of a drag, but that's all right. There's plenty of bait in my portfolio to make up for it. So those are kind of like the three pieces of my portfolio, there's the core holdings, there's the swing trades, which I'm only doing in a good market. If we're in a bad market, bear market, whatever you want to call it, choppy market, I'm typically not going to have any swing trades because the technicals don't look that great.

And then the third piece is the hedges. This year, like I said, I've been tilted more heavily towards ARKK and IWM. Now, if IWM starts to show relative strength to ARKK and QQQ, then I'll start to underweight IWM and overweight my QQQ hedge. Last year, it was ARKK that really saved me.

So, like I said, it was up 134% last year. I think it was up 86% going into the summertime when we got that big pullback from July. That's when I put on a 30% or 40% ARKK short, held that short or hedge, whatever you want to call it into the October lows, sold off or cover the hedge and then use that capital to add to some of my stocks that had pulled back and then rallied hard into year-end.

So, I mean, I do think if someone can learn how to hedge their portfolio with some of these index ETFs, and they don't have to short necessarily. There's a lot of inverse ETFs out there now. So if you're a broker IRA, whatever, doesn't allow a shorting, I mean, there's ways to hedge your portfolio with inverse ETFs.

And I just think now is a good time to start to add hedges to your portfolio as the markets feel like they're getting a little bit top heavy. And it's possible we get a pullback this summer like we did last summer, maybe that last two months, maybe that last three months, and then we could get that year-end rally. But a lot's going to depend on macro inflation, what the FOMC does, what the election's looking like. So, I mean, the next six months will be very interesting.

RS: How long did it take you to develop your strategy, A? B, would you say it's agnostic to - you talked about looking at some of the macro things and navigating for that. Is it agnostic to those things? Will you stay true to this strategy no matter what happens? And then kind of the third prong of that question would be, you mentioned your due diligence process, and I'm curious what that looks like.

JL: Yep. So I definitely look at macro. I mean, I'm not a macro expert. I don't try to predict where interest rates are going or where inflation is going. I track all of it. But I mean, I do have to have an opinion because I do have to try to position my portfolio when hedges accordingly. But at the end of the day, I mean, I'm more focused on fundamentals and valuations and knowing that if I find the right stocks, I hold them for two years, three years, four years, macro might be a headwind one year, macro might be a tailwind the next year.

So I try not to get caught up too much in the short-term fluctuations because of macro or something the FOMC said, or hot or cold jobs report. But I mean, obviously, impacts the market, impacts the stocks, impacts my subscribers.

So I have to pay attention. I try to have loose opinions, but I try to stay very agile, like I don’t. So my strategy's definitely changed over the last few years. I definitely don't stay married to my stocks like I probably used to a few years ago. When the story starts to change, the fundamentals start to change, something in my investment thesis starts to break down.

I am going to either trim that position aggressively or get out. Celsius is a good example. I was certainly one of the biggest bulls out there for Celsius over the past four years. I've done dozens of write-ups, probably hundreds of posts on Celsius. I was the one posting monthly, retail sales scan data, posting my investment models, and I was right for four years, I nailed it.

Pepsi (PEP) came in as their distributor, like the story played out perfectly. And coming into this year, I thought revenue growth would be somewhere in that 50% range, which would get them close to about $2 billion in revenues.

And when we got Q1 earnings, I knew the story was changing. Like revenues had started to slow down so much that I knew there was no way they were going to get to my targets for the year. And then when analysts started doing their write-ups for Q1 earnings, they started talking about this Pepsi inventory reduction.

And that's when I knew that like, I just, I need to get out of the position. Things were about to go from bad to worse with the story. And the multiple was already pretty extended to the point where any bad news was not going to be received well by the market, it wasn't priced in yet. So that's why I started exiting my position in the 90s and then aggressively got out in the 80s. Once I got, I think it was the April retail sales data. And then today, we got the last two months and Celsius is now growing 20% year-over-year.

I mean, this was a company that was growing triple digits year-over-year, just eight or nine months ago. And then that growth slowed down into the 50s, the 40s, the 30s, and now we're in the 20s. So I just think that multiple is going to have to get compressed significantly over the next three to six months kind of right size the company for where the fundamentals are right now.

So I try not to marry my stocks, as I say, we date our stocks, we don't marry them. And we only keep dating them as long as the fundamentals stay strong and valuations make sense. The hedging is something that I started doing last year. So in 2020, I think I was up 190%. Yeah, 2020, 2021, I was up 90% for the year.

I was up 140% at the highs going into 2021 Q3 earnings, had a lot of tech, cloud software, FinTech exposure, got absolutely destroyed in Q3 earnings. And unfortunately rode those stocks down too far into year-end. So I went from 140% up for the year to up, I think, it was 92% for the year. And then 2022 is when I really started to pivot my strategy and pay more attention to where's the strength, sector rotations.

So I was out of most of my tech stocks in late 2021, early 2022, pivoted into energy, shipping, those are my two biggest sectors for the first half of 2022. Once they started getting tired, I started to rotate back into some of my typical growth stocks, the Fintechs, the e-commerce names that have been beaten down pretty hard over those previous six months to 12 months. And then in 2023 is when I started to add the hedges as well.

So, I mean, my strategy has definitely evolved. Hopefully, I don't have to go back to where I was in 2022 and like get out of most of my stocks and rotate into value sectors, which I would prefer not to do, and it's just not my comfort zone. But at the end of the day, I don't want to fight the market. And if the market is going to punish my specific strategy for a long period of time, I'm more than willing to pivot into whatever strategy might work for me and my subscribers.

With that said, I mean, my stocks have done very, very well over the past few years. And even though some of them might be starting to run out of gas and kind of hitting that ceiling on valuation, trying to time the perfect exit at a high is very difficult. And then you also have to pay a lot of taxes. So that's where the hedges work well for me. I can stay a little bit more patient with my winners, knowing that if I'm hedging properly, I'll protect some of those gains.

And if the markets pull back, those stocks pull back with them, making the money on the hedges, not my longs, trim off the hedges, add to my longs, rinse and repeat. So, I would welcome a pullback this summer. I kind of hope we get one because I know that my hedges will give me some protection and then I'll be able to use some of the cash that I'm building up to add to some of my longs as we get towards the end of that pullback.

RS: And what else would you add in terms of your due diligence process?

JL: Oh, yeah. So part of my services on Seeking Alpha is the research. So all of my subscribers get my deep dives, my mini deep dives and my earnings write-ups. So deep dives are typically two per month. They're anywhere from 8,000 or 10,000 words and they go through the overview, kind of like the history of the company, talk about the founders, why was the company started, what's the mission, et cetera. And then we get into what's the business model, the market opportunity, the competitive landscape, the risks, and then we talked about valuation, technicals, investment models, and that's a deep dive.

And I actually did a survey last week for all of my subscribers asking probably 25 or 30 questions, just trying to find out how many people are reading my deep dives, how they're using the rest of my service and trying to figure out where I could add more value or make some changes. And I was surprised that I think 88% or 89% of my subscribers actually read my deep dives, which I thought the number would be half of that to be honest. And then I do…

RS: That's a big number for long form.

JL: Oh yeah, I was shocked…now whether they were lying or not, just to try to make them feel better, I don't know. But because I thought if people aren't reading the deep dives and they're taking 15 hours or 20 hours a week or every two weeks, maybe it's just not worth doing them. But if people are reading them, they obviously see the value.

And then, I mean, with the deep dives, if I'm doing 24 of these a year, obviously, I don't own most of these positions because the stocks I own, I've already done deep dives on it.

So what I do at that point is then we do mini deep dives. So typically, twice a year, I do a mini deep dive on all of my current holdings and explain to my subscribers what's my investment thesis? Am I still bullish? Where do I see the financials going over the next two or three years? What are my thoughts on the current valuation?

And just reaffirm why I like the stock and why I'm adding to it now or why I would add on pullbacks. And then every quarter on, when we get our quarterly earnings reports, we do a earnings write-up anywhere from 1,500 to 2,000 words and just talk about that company and where they are right now. What did last quarter look like? What does guidance look like? Any new products or catalysts on the horizon that we should be paying attention to.

So those are kind of the three pieces of the research part of the service, the deep dives, mini deep dives and earnings write-ups, and then every subscriber gets access to my investment portfolio spreadsheet, which has all of my core holdings, swing trades, hedges, and then all of my daily notes.

So all day long from 6:00 in the morning until 4:00 or 5:00 in the afternoon, I'm in front of my computers and I'm typically on the spreadsheet posting commentary for all of my stocks, charts and then all of my activities. So I'm adding to positions, trimming positions, starting new positions, all of that goes on the spreadsheets. All my subscribers can see it in real-time.

So literally, when I get filled on an order, as soon as I get filled, I go right to the spreadsheet and post it, so all my subscribers can see it. If they want to copy it, that's on them. Obviously, I don't provide any advice. I don't provide recommendations. My services are just meant to show my subscribers what I'm doing in real time. And hopefully, that helps them make better decisions for themselves.

RS: What would you say is a good example of one of the 20 stocks that you would talk about and one that you're following, that you don't own, that you're looking at maybe as something to include further down the line?

JL: Good question. So some of the swing trades are stocks that are like on the edge, stocks that I've started to follow, I like a lot about them. I'm just not ready to go full bore into that company. So like a Robinhood.

So I thought Robinhood was dead a couple of years ago. After the GameStop (GME) meme craze, they were suspending activity, their customers were pissed off, the CEO looked like kind of a sleazy guy. And I just thought Robinhood was done. The stock got down to, I think, $6 or $7. And I feel like they've really transformed the company over the last couple of years.

The CEO looks more - he looks and sounds more mature now. I think he's learned some lessons. The company has 24 million accounts, which is insane. That is such a big number compared to all of the other platforms out there.

Where they fall short is the average account size. So Robinhood's average account size is only $5,500, very, very tiny compared to all of the other platforms. Schwab is somewhere around 225,000. IBKR is somewhere between 150 and 180. E*TRADE is somewhere around 100,000. So even though Robinhood has the most accounts, they are very, very tiny. But I think that's an opportunity.

So I think a lot of their customers are early, earlier in their investing career, probably early 20s, mid 20s, they're just starting to work. They're just starting to make money. And these people have the ability over the next five, 10 years to make big contributions to those accounts, do 401(k) rollovers, maybe they inherit some money, maybe they sell a business. I mean, you don't know, but I think there's a lot of growth potential there.

And now they're being pretty aggressive with some of their IRA matching contribution plans, and they have this new Robinhood Gold Card that a lot of people want access to. So they have to roll over money in order to qualify for that.

So right now Robinhood has about $135 billion in AUC, which is assets under custody. I think there's a path to like 300 billion over the next few years. I think in three years, they could easily get to 30 million accounts, average account size of $10,000, 300 billion at their 1.8% sort of revenue to AUC number that puts them somewhere around $5.4 billion in revenues. If they hit $5.4 billion, this is probably a stock that has the chance to go up maybe 150% over the next three or four years.

So, I mean, there's a lot I like, I'm still digging in. I want to see a couple of more quarters of results and then I might be ready to build a bigger position. So right now, it's a swing trade. So as long as the technicals hold up, I'll stay in it. And if I continue to like what I see from the company, I might make it into a core holding.

So typically, like companies that I think I might want to own in the next 12 months that are like almost there for me, they'll become a swing trade, and then at some point they might get upgraded to a core holding. I mean, there's a few stocks that I was actually talking about today with my subscribers that have been beaten down so bad that I'm wondering if they're worth looking at now.

One is a company called Unity (U). I mean, that stock has just been absolutely obliterated. I believe they've brought in new management. Revenues are going to take a nosedive this year, but analysts expect them to bounce back next year. So, I mean, the problem is, I mean, you start going bottom fishing for these stocks and even though they look cheap, they can stay cheap for a long time, because they - it could be a frustrating turnaround story.

But at the same time, you go buy stocks at their 52-week highs or all-time highs, and there's a chance they look kind of expensive. Like CrowdStrike (CRWD), for instance, I have no cybersecurity exposure in my portfolio, I wish I could, but every time I look at a cybersecurity company, I just - my jaw drops at the valuation.

I mean, right now CrowdStrike, and it's a phenomenal company, I've owned it in the past, but the stock's trading at like 60x next year's or next 12 months EBITDA. And that's before you include the SBC, the stock-based comp. If you include the stock-based comp in the EBITDA or the free cashflow, I mean, now it's trading it over 100x. I just -- I don't understand how you justify that multiple.

Great company, but I think that's where I try to separate great company from great stock. I want to own great stocks. I want to make money.

RS: So is there ever a time where you get excited about something fundamentally and then look at the technicals and it turns you off?

JL: So if I get really excited about the fundamentals and the valuation and I have a strong investment thesis, and I see catalysts on the horizon that I don't think are being properly appreciated or priced in, I don't care about the technicals. And I will add to that stock as long as I have the conviction.

So technicals for me only really matter with swing trades. Once something is a core holding, I have conviction. I don't mind adding on pullbacks even when the technicals look like crap. So it's really just the swing trades where like my - I don't have the conviction to have a bigger position. I'm not going to go against the technicals in that case, which is one reason.

So I started a position in Zillow (Z) a couple - a few days ago, after it reclaimed the 200-day moving average, because I feel like once the FOMC finally cuts rates, you're going to see Zillow take off. And even if mortgage rates continue to come down, we should see stocks like Zillow, Redfin (RDFN), Rocket Mortgage (RKT) do well, but I don't really have that much conviction. This is sort of a catalyst play. And as soon as Zillow failed to close above the 200, I got rid of it. I stopped out.

So swing trades definitely respect the technicals. I mean, last year when I got really excited about Super Micro, it was last summer, somewhere around 180, 185, I believe. I started a 2% or 3% position. And then as the summer went along, the fall went along, the stock basically went sideways for four or five months.

And I couldn't understand it. I thought, I don't understand what the market doesn't understand about SMCI. They're building these custom liquid cooling racks for NVIDIA. We see NVIDIA blowing out earnings every quarter. Why is SMCI not getting any kudos?

So I just kept building my position, building my position. And then in January of this year, after I built my position to about 13% of my portfolio, they came out and pre-announced their -- I think that was their fiscal 2024 Q2 earnings, I forget, Q2 I think, and the stock jumped up, I think 40% or 50% the next day and rally another 200%. And it was just, I mean, it's what I was expecting to happen. I just didn't think it was going to happen in three weeks. I thought it would play out over the next two or three years.

So once that stock started getting closer to my two or three-year price target, obviously, I had to do the prudent thing and start trimming back my position. But the technicals, I mean, I don't remember exactly what the charts looked like in late 2023, but I think it might've been trading below its 200, but I just -- I don't care because the fundamentals to me were just screaming bye, bye, bye.

RS: Do you ever regret trimming your position when it starts to run like that?

JL: So I trimmed the SMCI a little bit too early. I started trimming probably in the mid-600s, but I didn't think it was going to go to 1,200 in four weeks.

RS: How right can I be for God's sakes? How good am I?

JL: I mean, yeah, in the hindsight, yes, I definitely trimmed SMCI too early. But a lot of times, like if I have a 13% position and it starts to rip. I'm probably going to let it get up to 15% or 16% before I start trimming it back. And then that's kind of like, that's kind of the ceiling for me.

So like every 5% it goes up, I'll trim it back to – to bring it back down to a 15% or 16% position. And then once it started to -- once it got over 1,000, that's when I started getting much more aggressive with my trimming. And by the time it got up to 1,200, I think, it had gotten down to maybe a 5% or 6% position in my portfolio.

TransMedics (TMDX) sort of did the same thing. I love TransMedics. I've owned it for almost three years now since it was in the 20s. Now it's in the 140s. And I had a, I don’t know, 15% position going into their last earnings report. They crushed it. Stock was up 30%, 40% the next day, and I had to start trimming it back. Just the position was just too big for my portfolio because one of my big concerns is, when I'm running a service like this, people sign up at all different times of the year.

Some people have been with me for three years, some have been with me for three months, and someone might sign up tomorrow and see my spreadsheet and think, “Oh, Jonah has a 18% position in TransMedics, he must really love TransMedics.” And then they try to copy it and build an 18% position. And what they don't realize right away is, well, it's 18% because I've been buying the stock for the last three years. My cost basis is probably in the 60s or 70s.

So I try to be mindful of that, but at the end of the day, like, I mean, I still have to run my portfolio in the way that's best for me. And then I hope my subscribers can keep up or at least learn my strategy over time.

RS: You talked a bit about NVIDIA and I'm not sick about talking about it. Maybe some people are sick about hearing about it. But I think it behooves us as investors to understand the nuance and sometimes the bombastic hyperbole that is the discussion around NVIDIA as it grows and flows and evolves.

How are you thinking about NVIDIA? How do you think about it as a stock in general and as a leader of the market right now?

JL: So they just did a 10 for 1 split. So I was buying in the high 300. So I guess that means I was buying in the high 30s now. And today, it closed at -- see where are we? So right now, it's at $127.40, I don't know what it's doing after hours. Oh, it's up 1% after hours.

I mean, just yesterday, people were talking about the bubbles in NVIDIA is dead, it's going back down under a 100. And then, NVIDIA gave everyone the middle finger today and was up 7%. So I guess, the story wasn't dead, maybe it was just taking a breather. I love NVIDIA. I wish I didn't own AMD. Thankfully my NVIDIA position is bigger than my (AMD) position.

But a lot of people miss NVIDIA. So they thought, okay, I'll buy AMD who maybe will -- it'll be a catch up trade. And a year later, we're realizing AMD is like five years behind NVIDIA.

I don't even know what to make of NVIDIA. I mean, I don't think we know what the next three, four, five years is going to look like for artificial intelligence. We don't know their specific roadmap. We don't know what competitors might be coming down the pipeline with their own chips.

I mean, we've all heard stories about the hyperscalers like Google (GOOG) (GOOGL), Microsoft (MSFT), they're going to want to build their own chips, okay, it sounds good. I don't know if they'll actually be able to do it.

And then how will those chips compare to whatever the newest, greatest NVIDIA chip is? And if they're building their own chips, are they going to save enough money by using an inferior chip to justify not using the best NVIDIA chip? Like, I don't know.

I mean, China, ByteDance (BDNCE) is apparently trying to develop their own chips now. I just -- it's wild. I just don't think, I think if you believe in artificial intelligence, I just think this is the one stock that you have to own and you can't try to trade in and out of it because it's going to do things like this, down 6% one day, up 8% the next day.

Thank God, I started buying it a year ago when it gapped up on that earnings report. Even though I didn't fully understand the importance of H100s and where that would lead us.

But now, I mean, you listen to these earnings calls from all the hyperscalers and all they talk about is trying to get their hands on as many H100s as possible, or H200s and the new BGs that are coming out. I mean, Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) is getting ready to build a supercomputer with Dell (DELL) and Super Micro with tens of thousands of H100s. Like - it's like an arms race, which company can buy the most H100s.

And then I don't even know what's going to happen in two or three years. Like, let's just say Meta (META) has 10,000 H100s. At what point does the next, like, do they have to upgrade? And then what do they do with the H100? Do they sell them off for $0.50 on the $1 or do they keep them and go buy whatever the new chip is? I don't know. It's going to be very interesting to play out. I just think if you believe in artificial intelligence and LLMs, and I just think NVIDIA is still the best way to play it.

And I mean, the stock might be expensive, I don't know. I mean, right now, the company's growing revenues by triple digits, earnings by triple digits, and it's trading at like 40x earnings. Like that's obviously not expensive, but obviously those growth rates are not sustainable.

I don't think we really know where growth is going to normalize out. I believe the analysts are still looking for 50% or 60% growth next year. But then does it stay at 50% for the next five years? Does it drop down to 20%? Do margins stay at 55%? Do they drop to 45%? I have no idea. I'm not sure anyone knows. And if they think they know, they probably don't. And the people calling the top are just - they're just pissed. They're the ones that never owned it.

So like they're all trying to call the top to justify the fact that they never owned it. So it's just -- it's been a wild story. I mean, that's, I think the stock was down to 120 last January, something like that. So, I mean, it's up 10x in the last 18 months.

Now I've heard the problem is some of their employees have made so much freaking money the last couple of years on NVIDIA stock that they don't ever have to work again. So I don't know what you do about that.

RS: Yeah. It sounds like a good problem until it's right in front of you and then it’s probably not such a great problem. I'm curious, you mentioned Tesla (TSLA), that's another controversial stock that I don't know if people know where to land on it. What are your thoughts on them?

JL: Yes, I was talking to my subscribers about it today. So I don't own Tesla right now. Tesla is one of those stocks that I do think it's overvalued right now based on the fundamentals, but that may not be the right way to look at the company.

I mean, if you think Tesla is just a car company, it's probably overvalued by 500%, right? I mean, Ford (F) and (GM) traded like 8x earnings and Tesla is probably trading at 45x earnings on a year where I believe revenues and earnings are both supposed to be down this year or flat best case scenario.

So how you justify 40x earnings for that, I have no idea. So Tesla is definitely overvalued where it is. I mean, I would say based on the fundamentals for this year, it's probably an $80 stock.

However, if we are going to continue to see this electric vehicle revolution, and five or 10 years from now, every state has banned the sale of ICE vehicles, and there are supercharging networks from coast to coast. I mean, then it is possible that Tesla, over the next five, 10 years, can grow revenues at 15%, 20%, 25% a year. But even that doesn't probably get you back to a $1 trillion market cap.

I mean, where that extra $2 trillion, $3 trillion is coming from that people talk about, it's all the other stuff. It's the Robotaxi network, it's the humanoids or the robots that they're apparently working on.

And I was talking, because I have a big position in Uber (UBER). I've owned Uber for the past couple of years. I was loading up on it in the summer of 2022 when the stock got down into the 20s and I've trimmed my position back. I mean, Uber is now almost at 8% position in my portfolio. So I mean, still decent size, pretty low cost basis.

And I mean, for me, the two biggest risks are recession, where people stop going out to eat, they stop traveling, you have less conferences and it's those airport rides where Uber makes a lot of money, bringing people to bars and restaurants. So if people were going out and spending less money, that would be very bad for Uber. That's one risk.

The other risk is Tesla and what they do with an autonomous robotaxi network. And we're going to get a presentation, I guess, in August, that's what Elon Musk has been talking about for the past couple of months, but no one really knows what to expect.

We don't know if, at least, I don't think we know, is Tesla going to develop like a special car or taxi for this robo network, or are they just going to unveil the technology that's going to power consumers vehicles so they can like donate their vehicle to the Tesla robo taxi network and then have their car essentially act as a Uber during the day and pick people up and then they split the money with Tesla.

Like, I don't know. I'm trying to like think through what it's going to be. I'm trying not to waste too much time thinking about it because until we get that August presentation, I'm not really sure we're going to have any concrete answers. And then I don't even know if Tesla is going to try to do this themselves or are they going to work with Uber.

Uber has over 130 million customers that use their app. They've been doing this for, I mean, almost 20 years, at least, well, 15 years, and they know how to run a ride sharing network.

So are they going to partner with Uber or are they going to compete against Uber? And I don't even know the answer to that yet. But I mean, I've seen, I know Cathie Wood is talking about Tesla, 10x upside over the next decade. I mean, maybe that sounds a little crazy, but I also didn't think we'd have, Apple (AAPL), NVIDIA and Microsoft combined market caps of $10 trillion.

So is it possible that Tesla could go up 10x from here? Maybe, I mean, if they really build a robotaxi network and 20% of the U.S. decides to buy Teslas and use those Teslas as part of the robotaxi network, like I'm not even sure that the numbers work out.

So it's one that I want to get back in. I'm just trying to find the right time, the right price. I could see the stock running up into that August presentation. So if you look at a chart for Tesla, it's currently below the VWAP from the December highs. If it pushes back above the VWAP from the December highs, I'll get into Tesla with the swing trade. And hopefully, I can hold that into the August presentation because I'm very, very curious what Elon Musk is going to come up with.

RS: Jonah, I really appreciate this first conversation. There's so much here to chew on for investors. Anything that you want to leave investors with as we wind down?

JL: I mean, I'm sure they probably got a feel for my strategy. So I mean, like I told you before we started recording, I mean, I run a pretty aggressive strategy, but I know what I own. I do a lot of research and due diligence. I understand position sizing, risk management. I have investment models for all of my stocks that I update quarterly or more.

So I have a pretty good feel for valuation and where I think the prices could go over the next three or four years if everything plays out according to plan. So if you are looking to build a portfolio, manage it yourself, which I think you should do.

I think most of us should be active investors rather than passive. I think most of us, if we put a little bit of effort into it, can outperform the indexes. Like I'm just way too competitive to have my money sitting in (SPY) or (QQQ).

I never would be comfortable just owning the index and doing whatever the index does. I want to outperform. I mean, that's me and I've been doing it year after year. So if you're looking for someone like myself that runs a pretty concentrated portfolio of 20 stocks and swing trades and hedges, definitely check out my service. I'd love to try to help out.

Introduction

In my previous report, I highlighted Costco Wholesale Corporation's (NASDAQ:COST) exorbitant valuation as a sign of irrational exuberance in the financial markets:

Costco is trading well above its historical median P/E ratios, and we are getting pretty close to the 1999 peak valuation for COST stock. While we may or may not be in an artificial intelligence bubble, Costco certainly appears to be bubblicious. YCharts Reverse DCF exercise Based on its current stock price of ~$732 per share, Mr. Market is currently pricing in a 5-year CAGR revenue growth rate of ~23% into Costco's stock! Given Costco's mid-single-digit growth rates, the market pricing in ~5x faster growth into COST stock for the next five years is simply ridiculous. Yes, Costco is a serial growth compounder; however, such pricing is a tell-tale sign of irrational exuberance in the stock market. In QQQ: Prepare for Turbulence, I highlighted the role of abundant liquidity in the ongoing melt-up in financial markets. If liquidity dries up, Costco's stock could struggle big time, as investor expectations built into the stock are completely out of touch with business reality. Costco is a mature (slow-growing) retailer priced for hypergrowth. Source: Costco Is Dead Money

Since the publication of that report, the big box retailer's shares have rallied by +16% over the last three months:

SeekingAlpha

In this note, we will examine the key driver of this latest leg up in Costco stock and re-evaluate its long-term risk/reward to formulate an informed decision.

Demystifying COST Stock Rally

While Costco bulls will point to its high-quality business model and healthy financial performance in order to justify the ongoing rally in COST stock, the single most important driver of this run-up is a wild expansion in trading multiples. Over the last three months alone, Costco's forward P/E multiple has expanded by +15.5% from ~46x to ~53x, which is more or less the entirety of COST's recent move higher!

Data by YCharts

Now, Costco outperformed top and bottom line estimates for Q3 2024, and consensus revision trends have largely been moving in the right direction. However, the quantum of Q3 revenue and EPS beats were de minimus, and analyst estimates for upcoming quarters are only slightly higher than where they were three months ago. Hence, Costco's business performance and near-term outlook do not justify its trading multiple expansion.

SeekingAlpha SeekingAlpha SeekingAlpha

In the financial markets, irrational exuberance knows no bounds, and so, Costco's bubbilicious valuation could potentially go even higher in the short run. That said, over the long run, a negative equity risk premium [as measured by FCF Yield minus 10-year US Treasury yield] is simply unsustainable.

YCharts

Costco is a cash-cow business with an incredible moat; however, Mr. Market pricing COST stock as a safer asset than risk-free US Treasury bonds is quite simply ridiculous as Costco cannot tax the American public or print money out of thin air. Now, some may point to Costco's past compounding and future growth potential to defend its premium valuation. While I understand the quality growth aspect, paying up ~53x forward earnings for a mature retailer growing at single-digit rates doesn't seem like a bright idea.

Costco Fair Value And Expected Return

After recording healthy double-digit top-line growth during the inflationary wave in 2020-22, Costco has seen its growth rates slow back down to mid-to-high-single digits over recent quarters. And, according to consensus street estimates, Costco is projected to compound sales growth at 6-7% per year for the next 5 years.

SeekingAlpha

Considering Costco's footprint expansion plans of 25-30 clubs per year and comparable store sales growth of 3-5% per year, I believe Costco can deliver 6-9% CAGR sales growth over the next five years. While our growth assumption is slightly higher than street estimates, I think a 7.5% CAGR sales growth assumption is reasonable. Like in our previous evaluation, we have used a 5-year modeling period and generous assumptions for steady-state free cash flow margin [+3%] and terminal growth rate [+5%]. While these model assumptions are quite straightforward, please feel free to share your questions, thoughts, and/or concerns in the comments section below.

Here is our updated valuation model for Costco:

TQI Valuation Model (Free to use at TQIG.org)

From our previous assessment, Costco's fair value estimate has increased to ~$402 per share [from ~$394 per share]. However, with COST stock trading at ~$850 per share, Costco now has a downside of roughly -53%.

Assuming a somewhat generous P/FCF exit multiple of ~25x [accounting for Costco's economic moat], we get to a 5-year price target of ~$722 per share, which implies a CAGR return of -3.21%.

TQI Valuation Model (Free to use at TQIG.org)

In light of its latest leg up, Costco's long-term risk/reward has deteriorated even further, with Costco stock now looking worse than dead money for the next five years. With COST's base case expected 5-year CAGR return falling well short of my investment hurdle rate (of 15% per year), long-term market (SPY) returns (of 8%-10% per year), and risk-free treasury yields (of 4%+), I continue to view COST stock as a tactical ""Sell"" for long-term investors.

As the German proverb goes - ""Trees do not grow to the sky""

With animal spirits running wild in the financial markets, Costco's exorbitant valuation could stretch even further in the near term; however, ascribing hypergrowth to a mature retailer is irrational. Taking profits on a serial compounder like Costco is a tough decision, but nobody ever lost money taking a profit, even after accounting for taxes! A negative equity risk premium is unsustainable, i.e., Costco will suffer a mean reversion sooner or later. With risk-free treasuries yielding ~4-5% right now, long-term investors have a solid hiding spot as they wait for Costco's stock to come back in line with business realities.

Key Takeaway: I continue to rate Costco a ""Sell"" in the mid-$800s.

The Honest Company (NASDAQ:HNST) is one of those stocks that has been on my watchlist for ages. Since it went public in 2021, the price has gone from more than $19 per share to just above $1. After a couple of positive quarters with a huge margin expansion, the company seems compelling and a lot of investors are wondering if now is the right time to invest.

Stock quotation (Author's Python file using Yfinance library)

I will begin with a company's overview, focusing on its business and industry. I will then assess the company's financials, its catalysts, and main risks. I will finally conclude with a quick valuation and some takeaways.

Company Overview

Business description

The company corresponds to the one described in the Peter Lynch approach: it is boring and sells boring products. It sells a wide variety of household and personal products: diapers, wipes, bath products, vitamin supplements, skincare and makeup, baby clothing, and cleaning products.

The company has implemented an omnichannel strategy that allows it to meet consumers wherever and whenever they want to shop. They are in the main retailers and as of 31st of March 2024, their products can be found in more than 49,000 locations across the U.S. and Canada. The company also maintains a direct relationship with customers through its digital platform, Honest.com.

Honest is focused on innovation, it has in-house research and development laboratories where the research and development team, composed of chemists and technologists, develop innovative products using the latest green technologies. The focus on product innovation is central to attracting and retaining customers.

Industry description

The Honest Company operates in the household and personal products, a sector that generates around $700 billion in annual revenues. The industry has significantly enhanced our well-being and living standards by promoting hygiene, convenience, and aesthetic appeal in our daily routines and environments.

Even though the two kinds of products seem to fall in the same category, in reality, they have very different prospects and growth rates.

The household product market encompasses cleaning products, kitchenware and appliances, home décor and furnishings. It is expected to grow at a 3.6% CAGR between 2024 and 2030.

On the other hand, personal care products include deodorants, hair care, oral care, shaving, and bath products, and their sales are expected to grow at a solid 7.96% CAGR until 2029 globally.

Success is primarily driven by the management team's execution capabilities and their ability to secure shelf space with retailers and increase the number of repeat customers.

The products sold are mainly necessary, thus I do not expect much of a cyclicality either for the industry or the company itself.

Company's Financials

Income Statement

Unlike all the other big corporations that I have analyzed in my previous articles on Seeking Alpha, The Honest Company is the first one that presents a net loss. The investment thesis here, in fact, is not related to dividend collection or the ability of managers to increase profits, it is more like a sort of bet on the possibility of the company to generate profits and cashflows in the future.

Income Statement Overview (Author's Excel sheet)

Since 2019 the firm's revenues have grown at a 7.9% CAGR, outperforming the industry which grew at just above 2% CAGR in the same period. The average gross margin in the period was 32.2% while the net margin was at -11.43%.

Profitability margins (Author's Excel sheet)

Even though the situation described is a little bit too risky for my investment standards, the reason that got me to take a deeper look at this business is the company's Q1 2024 results. After an incredible application of the ""transformation policy"", gross margins reached an outstanding 37% while net profits reached a -1.6%. The company is finally finding its path to a sustainable business model and is approaching my investment grade.

Balance Sheet

First of all, I would like to make it crystal clear that the company, as stated in the last earnings report, has no financial debt on the balance sheet. The only source of long-term liabilities reported in the document are capital leases, which as reported in the latest 10-Q, are mainly operational.

Leases overview (Company's 10Q)

Therefore, according to Seeking Alpha data, the voice ""Total debt"", is mainly composed of leases.

Total debt considering both financial and operational debt (Seeking Alpha)

Overall, long-term debt is not an issue for the company, which is great because it allows managers to focus on long-term strategy without worrying about short-term debt deadlines.

Since the company has grown significantly lately and is establishing solid relationships with both retailers and suppliers, I expect it to report major improvements in net working capital (which has deeply grown in the last few years), also thanks to tighter inventory control.

2019 2020 2021 2022 2023 Receivables 24.3 22.8 31.8 42.3 43.1 Payables 20.8 31.1 28.7 24.8 22.3 Inventory 52.5 76.7 75.7 115.7 73.5 NWC 56 68.4 78.8 133.2 94.3 Click to enlarge Click to enlarge

Similarly, I would also like to see a major drop in the cash conversion cycle, which passed from 108 days in 2019 to more than 120 days in 2023. According to the managers' opinion during the last earnings call, the company has strong enough shoulders now to control it and enhance its free cash flow.

2019 2020 2021 2022 2023 DSO 37.1307301 27.3144759 35.9322034 48.5431941 45.0522648 DIH 118.3469 143.364486 130.081146 188.215093 108.531583 DPO 46.8879148 58.1308411 49.3174224 40.3434252 32.92863 CCC 108.589716 112.548121 116.695927 196.414862 120.655218 Click to enlarge Click to enlarge

Overall, the ability to convert finished products into cash as quickly as possible is crucial for a manufacturing company in its early stages to survive and grow.

Cash Flow Statement

After years of negative results in the cash flow statement, the company reported a positive operating cash flow and a positive free cash flow in 2023.

Free Cash Flow Over Time (Seeking Alpha)

The explanations of such an achievement by the ex-CEO are in line with my reasoning reported in the previous sub-paragraph:

The Company ended the fourth quarter of 2023 with $33 million in cash, cash equivalents, and short-term investments, an increase of $18 million versus the prior year 2022, reflecting disciplined management of working capital. Inventory was reduced by 36%, or $42 million versus the prior year 2022, which was significantly ahead of the Company’s initial target of a $20 million reduction in inventory in 2023.

Catalyst

The company is focused on innovation and primarily offers organic and natural. This positions the company in a rapidly growing market segment that has seen a significant boost in sales after the COVID-19 pandemic and is still attracting customers.

The increasing interest in organic products and sustainability over the past few years is evident. As consumers become more aware of health disruptors—such as ultra-processed foods and personal care products with harmful chemicals—and their potential negative impacts, the demand for cleaner, safer products is more apparent than ever.

Since 2007 this industry has grown from $97 billion to more than $300 billion and is expected to grow by around 5% during 2024 with significant growth driven by Asia, particularly China.

Thanks to its clear positioning and effective communication, the company offers shareholders a unique opportunity to capitalize on the strong growth in the clean and natural market.

Risks

There are two main sources of risks when looking at HNST:

First of all, as a small company currently reporting losses, we cannot be certain if it will achieve profitability. Although the cost reduction policy introduced by the company appears to be effective, it is still insufficient. The direction taken seems promising, and I am willing to give the CEO and the managers the benefit of the doubt to see how they will ultimately turn things around.

Moreover, the company faces intense competition from large players with years of market experience and substantial capital for innovation and marketing. Major brands like Procter & Gamble, Colgate-Palmolive, and Johnson & Johnson are also gradually shifting towards natural and organic alternatives, reducing the competitive edge of The Honest Company. This scenario has led many similar companies to file for Chapter 11 bankruptcy, for example, Tattooed Chef in the plant-based frozen food industry.

Valuation

Given that the company reported a positive free cash flow result in 2023, I decided to use this metric to assess the company using the discounted cash flow model. Since the company has no financial debt outstanding, I computed the cost of equity, which obviously in this case corresponds also to the WACC, obtaining 14.57%. This high rate is mainly due to a very high beta, reflecting the significant volatility of the stock.

I projected a revenue growth of around 5%, to meet the industry average CAGR for the next five years. Throughout the projection period, I kept the free cash flow margin fixed at 4.5%, which is just a little bit lower than the one reported for the 2023 fiscal year. These projections are intentionally conservative.

Based on these projections and assumptions, I arrived at an equity value of $220.67 million for the company. This valuation indicates that the stock is currently overvalued by 20% relative to the current market price.

The Honest Company Valuation (Author's calculations)

Conclusions

The Honest Company is one of those stocks that I continue to watch closely, debating whether it is the right time to buy. Despite the impressive margin increase in the last quarter, I still have reservations about its ability to achieve GAAP profitability and withstand competition. Given the recent margin improvement, I would consider starting a position at around $2 per share to ensure a margin of safety.","arsenik/iStock via Getty ImagesThe Honest Company (NASDAQ:HNST) is one of those stocks that has been on my watchlist for ages.

Seeking Alpha,https://seekingalpha.com/article/4701822-bright-horizons-family-addressing-the-demand-for-more-childcare-services?source=feed_all_articles,2024-07-01,12:03:44 UTC,Bright Horizons Family: Addressing The Demand For More Childcare Services (NYSE:BFAM),"monkeybusinessimages/iStock via Getty Images

Summary

I am positive on Bright Horizons Family (NYSE:BFAM). My summarized thesis is that BFAM will benefit from the increased demand for childcare services as more women participate in the workforce (leading to more dual-parent working households). BFAM is well positioned to benefit because of its scale and reputation advantage, which is hard to replicate. Concerns over near-term growth pressure from macro tailwinds should go away once BFAM shows the market it can continue to grow at 10%.

Company overview

BFAM is a childcare services provider to parents on behalf of employer sponsors, and it has a long operating history of more than 25 years. So far, BFAM has served more than 1,400 clients, with more than 200 of them being Fortune 500 companies. As of 1Q24, BFAM has 1,044 centers that can cater for up to 120,000 children. BFAM operates in the US (~73% of revenue), Europe (including the UK and Netherlands), and Australia, which account for 27% of total revenue in FY23.

BFAM

Growing need for childcare services

There are various secular tailwinds that are driving more demand for childcare services. In particular, there is a growing number of women who are pursuing full-time careers. This is in line with the report from the Bureau of Labor Statistics, where there are more working-age women employed than ever before (this report, while dated, gives a good perspective on this trend). Accordingly, this has driven the percentage of families with both parents working up to 67%. To make things worse, according to a study by The Pew, a large portion of these parents have a living parent (age > 65) that they need to attend to. If we combine all these various dynamics together, naturally, this means that there is less time available for parents to take care of their children, and they need a solution to address this.

The macro tailwind has also allowed childcare providers to continuously raise prices in the same direction as inflation, and I expect this pricing power to continue to sustain itself moving forward, especially for large players like BFAM.

Scale and reputation are key competitive advantages

There are two main competitive advantages that I see in BFAM: scale and reputation.

Scale is an advantage for various reasons. First and foremost, having scale (wide regional coverage) enables BFAM to address demand from large corporations that require childcare solutions in all their footprints, given that it is easier to deal with one player than multiple small players. Secondly, it means more financial capacity to address the biggest constraint to growth in the industry: labor. To run a center, one needs to have enough labor, and given that labor in this industry is still not back to pre-covid levels, the one that can afford to pay more will be able to retain or attract employees. Also, having more financial capacity enables BFAM to better tide through economic cycles (covid forced a lot of childcare providers to close down).

BFAM

Reputation is arguably just as important as scale advantage (I think they go hand in hand). Reputation is extremely important because BFAM is dealing with children, and parents are very mindful of who is handling their kids while they are away. As such, I believe parents will prefer reputable providers. This dynamic pushes employers to partner with reputable players, as they do not want to risk facing any backlash from children getting mistreated. BFAM wins in this area because of the blue-chip client base that it has built over time. This forms a virtuous cycle for BFAM, as employers that are looking for a solution provider would assess the client base of BFAM. I believe the natural thinking process would be, “Since these large players trust BFAM, BFAM should be trustworthy,"" and as BFAM partners with more clients, it becomes “more reputable."" The thing about reputation is that it cannot be replicated within a short period of time.

All in all, with these two competitive advantages, I believe new entrants or subscale players will not be able to easily disrupt BFAM’s market position.

Attractive operating model

BFAM BFAM BFAM

BFAM also has an asset-light operating model that frees up cash to fund its M&A strategy. In the US (majority of revenue), BFAM operates a client-sponsor model, where the required CAPEX of new centers is funded by employers. In turn, BFAM will operate the centers and earn a corresponding revenue from offering the services. Because of the nature of this partnership, the relationship has historically been very sticky (95% retention rate), and this makes sense since the center is built with the intention that BFAM will operate it.

BFAM

The beauty of this model is that BFAM has little cash outlay and is able to convert a large portion of each earnings to free cash flow (FCF], which is being used to fund its M&A strategy. Since 2009, BFAM has generally converted more than 100% of its adj. net income into FCF. With this cash, BFAM has executed its M&A strategy aggressively, acquiring a few hundred centers over the past two decades. As you can see, BFAM's entire business model benefits from an inherent virtuous cycle: Asset light operating model: frees up cash to fund M&A; > provides scale > increases reputation > attracts more clients > increases scale > and the cycle repeats.

Valuation

Source: Author's calculation Source: Author's calculation

I believe BFAM is worth 20% more than the current share price. My target price is based on FY26 adjusted net income of $224 million and a forward PE multiple of 33x. Post-subprime period, BFAM has historically grown at high single-digit to low-teen growth rates, and I am assuming similar growth over the next 3 years. I believe 10% is easily achievable considering the secular tailwinds and BFAM's competitive advantage. Management is also guiding FY24 revenue growth of 10%. In a normalized environment (pre-covid), BFAM operates at around ~7% adj net income margin, and I assume this level of margins will continue forward.

One major variant view that I have vs. the market today is that I expect BFAM to trade at 33x forward PE (BFAM historical average) vs. the 30x that it is trading today. In my view, the recent pressure on multiples is likely due to the market being worried about the macro environment, where many employers are firing staff, and this would mean less near-term demand for childcare services. I don’t disagree that this is a near-term macro headwind, but 1Q24 results already show signs of recovery. Full service center occupancy rates averaged >60% in 1Q24, an improvement from 55–60% in 1Q23, with healthy enrollment trends in the US, Netherlands, and Australia. Furthermore, 44% of full-service centers have occupancy rates above 70%, a 900-bps improvement vs. 35% in 1Q23. In the US, despite the macro headlines, enrollments grew by high single-digits year over year, with solid performance across all age groups and center models and notable double-digit growth among infants and toddlers. Regarding labor, BFAM has made healthy progress in shoring up center staffing levels through improved recruitment and retention rates.

As BFAM shows the market that it is able to grow as it did historically, the market should re-rate BFAM back to its normalized (average) multiple of 33x.

Investment Risk

BFAM UK full-service business, which accounts for around 13% of sales, is still facing difficulties due to a low occupancy rate caused by a combination of an unfavorable macro environment and personnel shortages. In addition, BFAM's education advisory business continues to underperform expectations, and the full-year guidelines have been reduced to low-single-digit growth from mid-single-digit growth. This was mainly caused by low client uptake and employee participation. While these segments are small on a standalone basis, they still make up a sizeable amount on a collective basis. If the macro headwinds worsen in these areas, it may drag down growth to below 10% levels.

Conclusion

My positive view on BFAM is because of its strong position in a growing market for childcare services. I expect BFAM to benefit from the macro tailwinds and be able to capture share given its strong competition advantage (scale and reputation). BFAM's asset-light model also enables it to convert earnings to FCF at a high rate, providing it capital to fund its M&A strategy, which further strengthens its competition advantage.","My summarized thesis is that BFAM will benefit from the increased demand for childcare services as more women participate in the workforce (leading to more dual-parent working households).

Seeking Alpha,https://seekingalpha.com/article/4701820-comcast-stock-neither-growth-nor-value?source=feed_all_articles,2024-07-01,11:34:13 UTC,Comcast: Neither Growth Nor Value (NASDAQ:CMCSA),"Sundry Photography

Investment thesis

I do not like to use a ""zombie company"" term for Comcast (NASDAQ:CMCSA). The company has vibrant history, and it can even be called iconic. Its profitability is still stellar and recent earnings show that there is still some potential to expand left.

On the other hand, the business mostly consists of units operating either in highly competitive or highly saturated industries. Wall Street analysts do not expect any real growth in revenue for the next decade, and this projection looks fair due to the company's absence in any thriving industries. Capital allocation approach of the past decade also looks questionable as high leverage for new projects did not help to create more value for shareholders. The stock is more than 30% undervalued, but I consider it fair given stagnating financial metrics and no exposure to emerging industries. All in all, I assign CMCSA a ""Hold"" rating.

Company information

Comcast is one of the largest cable and telecommunications company in the United States. The company's offerings include television, high-speed internet, and telephone services.

The company's fiscal year ends on December 31. Residential Connectivity & Platforms segment is the largest revenue and EBITDA contributor to the company's consolidated P&L. This segment's offerings include residential broadband, video revenue, advertising. For more detailed information regarding each segment readers can refer to the latest 10-K report.

Comcast's latest 10-K report

Financials

Comcast's financial performance over the last decade has been solid with a 6.5% revenue CAGR and stable gross margins. On the other hand, the operating margin shrank by the end of the decade below 20%. The FCF margin has been consistently positive, ranging between high single-digits and low double-digits.

Author's calculations

Capital allocation looks questionable. Debt levels are high and liquidity ratios are quite low. High debt level is not a problem itself, but when we look at it with the context of stagnating operating profitability, there are questions about the necessity of this high leverage to finance new projects. On the other hand, the current debt level is much lower compared to five years ago, which is a positive trend. Moreover, CMCSA blended rather aggressive deleveraging with solid dividend growth. Though, the stock's forward 3.24% dividend yield is still lower than 10-year Treasuries yields by around one percentage point.

Seeking Alpha

The latest quarterly earnings were released on April 25, when the company delivered positive revenue and EPS surprises. Revenue growth was quite modest with a 1.24% YoY increase. The adjusted EPS expanded from $0.92 to $1.04 YoY. The good news is that the EPS expansion was partially achieved with the operating leverage as key profitability metrics showed modest expansion.

Seeking Alpha

The upcoming earnings release is scheduled for July 23. The Q2 revenue is expected by consensus to be $30.10 billion, which will mean a slight YoY decrease. The adjusted EPS is expected to follow the top line with a one cent YoY decrease. Wall Street's sentiment around the upcoming earnings release is quite weak because there were fourteen EPS estimates downgrades over the last 90 days.

Seeking Alpha

Long-term revenue and EPS consensus estimates are not very promising. Revenue is expected to grow approximately in line with inflation, while the EPS is expected to slight outpace revenue growth. It is difficult to agree here with EPS projections because due to the long-term inflationary effect on costs it will be almost impossible to drive profitability expansion without top line growth.

The entertainment industry has changed significantly over the last ten or fifteen years. Younger generations prefer streaming video services like Netflix (NFLX), Disney+ (DIS), YouTube (GOOGL), Apple TV (AAPL) and dozens of other players. Video consumption increasingly shifts to these services, making traditional cable television less relevant in modern world. And this is a global trend, not only confronted in the U.S.

In addition to intense competition from formidable players in video streaming, Comcast also faces amplified competition from telecom providers and satellite broadcast firms. Telecom operators are actively marketing high-speed internet, digital phone services, which are usually bundled into quite appealing offerings for customers.

The sentiment around CMCSA looks weak and the stock has been falling over the last several months despite the broader market rallying. As one of the greats said, the stock market is a voting machine over the short-term. That said, CMCSA's share price might continue stagnating until the market's sentiment improves. While tech giants continue beating their all-time highs in 2024, it is difficult to say when investors will pay attention to value stocks like CMCSA.

Seeking Alpha

Valuation

The stock declined by 6% over the last twelve months and the YTD performance is also disappointing with a 10% decline. The stock currently trades closer to the lower end of the last 52 weeks' range. Comcast's valuation ratios look very attractive both compared to the sector median and historical averages. That said, the stock is undervalued from the perspective of ratios.

Seeking Alpha

To determine the upside potential, I am simulating the discounted cash flow [DCF] model. I use a 7.42% WACC recommended by Gurufocus. Consensus projects revenue to deliver around 2% CAGR over the next decade, which looks applicable for my DCF model. Since revenue is expected to compound in line with inflation, I do not expect the FCF margin to show notable improvements. Therefore, I use a flat 10.2% FCF ex-SBC margin, which is the past decade's average.

Author's calculations

According to my DCF simulation, the fair value of the business is $201 billion. This is 34% higher than the current market cap and such an upside might look attractive for some investors. However, I think that the discount is fair given the fact that the company's revenue and profits are expected to be almost flat on a nominal basis, and the current dividend yield is still notably below the risk-free rate.

Risks to my cautious thesis

Shifts in the market sentiment are difficult to forecast. Some unfavorable news like the Fed unexpectedly deciding to introduce few more rate cuts due to the strong stance of the U.S. economy might cause a selloff in growth stocks. This can lead to a notable rotation of investors' capital to stocks like CMCSA due to their attractive valuation and solid dividend growth. In this case my cautious thesis will not age well.

Comcast's business boasts various segments, and the company has a lot of assets. This means that the company has a huge room for restructuring, divesting, and investing. For example, Disney's stock (DIS) also suffered a lot of pain before Bob Iger returned and started executing his transformation plan. Despite DIS still trading below pre-pandemic levels, it is difficult to deny that the stock became much more interesting to investors after Bob Iger started the turnaround and it even showed periods with notable rallies. For companies with diversified assets and segments there is always a possibility for restructuring and creating new synergies.

Bottom line

To conclude, CMCSA is a ""Hold"". A notable discount to the share price looks fair given no exposure to notable secular growth drivers. On the contrary, most of Comcast's businesses operate in highly saturated markets where there is almost no room for growth.","Sundry PhotographyInvestment thesisI do not like to use a ""zombie company"" term for Comcast (NASDAQ:CMCSA).

Introduction

Most of my articles are about ""big picture"" developments. I'm not only doing this to use them as a foundation for stock picks but also because I believe that discussing major developments is sometimes more important than discussing individual stock picks.

I also want to provide value for people who may not like my stock picks to have info for their own stock selection.

Some big-picture developments we have frequently discussed are (some more than others):

The energy bull case.

Artificial intelligence.

A top-heavy S&P 500.

Inflation.

Supply chain re-shoring.

Biden/Biden picks.

Green transition.

Needless to say, a lot of these topics are in some way related. This includes the impact of artificial intelligence on energy demand and the composition of the S&P 500, which is something I want to discuss in this article.

The S&P 500 just exited the first half of this year. It returned 14%, which is the second-best first-half performance this century.

Speaking of this century, the number of record highs (31) in the first half of this year is also the second-highest number this century.

Bloomberg

Since the lows on October 12, 2022, the market has added $16 trillion in value, most of it coming from technology and communications services. The same goes for the first six months of this year.

Bloomberg

What's interesting is Nvidia (NVDA) was a huge outlier, adding more than 200 points to the S&P 500 in the first half, with a number of ""big guys"" adding more than 40% year-to-date.

Bloomberg

While this is great for people who simply own the S&P 500, it has created a very unusual situation, as the equal-weight S&P 500 has underperformed the market-weighted S&P 500 (the ""normal"" S&P 500) by the widest margin in the first six months of a year ever.

This is what the underperformance of the equal-weighted S&P 500 compared to the S&P 500 since October 12, 2022, looks like:

Bloomberg

As of June 27, the biggest six companies in the S&P 500 account for 31.4% of the S&P 500!

These companies are Microsoft (MSFT), Apple (AAPL), Nvidia, Amazon (AMZN), Meta Platforms (META), and Alphabet (GOOGL).

What do these companies have in common?

They all have turned into AI plays.

Don't get me wrong, I'm not ""hating"" on these companies. They all have phenomenal products, pristine balance sheets, and bright futures.

The problem I see is diversification. The S&P 500's purpose is to offer diversified exposure. Right now, it has turned into an AI play, with most sectors lagging behind.

If the AI rally runs into trouble, the S&P 500 is likely poised to underperform - especially because it is now valued at 21x earnings, indicating subdued returns in the years ahead (see the chart below).

JPMorgan

Again, I'm not making the case the AI rally is over. This is simply a risk/reward assessment. As much as I believe AI enthusiasm was justified, it's not something that will last forever, especially because expectations are now sky-high.

However, this does not mean the average investor is now looking at a high likelihood of subdued returns in the years ahead.

Because the S&P 500's surge was mainly fueled by tech, a lot of companies have been left in the dust - often with great valuations and potential.

In this article, I'll present three dividend stocks that all trade at very attractive valuations, have great business models, and come with either high income or consistent dividend growth.

I own one of them and have the other two on my watchlist.

Norfolk Southern (NSC) - A Struggling Giant With Tremendous Potential

Norfolk Southern was one of the first dividend stocks I bought, as I wanted to own a company with a good dividend growth track record, an ultra-wide moat, and the ability to benefit from secular growth like economic re-shoring.

Regarding its moat, headquartered in Atlanta, Georgia, Norfolk Southern is one of America's largest Class I railroads, which enjoys a duopoly with its peer CSX Corp. (CSX) in the Eastern third of the United States.

Association of American Railroads

Because of its dominant position, it enjoys a very wide moat, which is one of the reasons why it has consistently outperformed the S&P 500 and most non-rail transportation peers.

Unfortunately, the company's stock has been lackluster since early 2022, when it started to encounter a number of headwinds, including weaker economic growth, falling consumer sentiment (NSC is a major intermodal railroad), a derailment in East Palestine, Ohio, and ongoing operating challenges.

Data by YCharts

In other words, the company has somewhat lost its way, which was reflected in poor 1Q24 earnings, when the company reported 2% lower revenues, 1% higher expenses, and 6% lower operating income - adjusted for the East Palestine derailment.

Norfolk Southern Corporation

It now has an operating ratio of 69.9%, which is a horrible result.

With that said, I am a buyer of NSC, as I am a big fan of buying undervalued stocks with turnaround potential - especially in critical supply chains.

Pressured by activist investors, NSC is working hard to turn its business around, which includes cutting costs and improving rail operations.

Our strategy is designed to mirror the great success stories of the Canadian railroads who have recognized that PSR is about more than tearing a railroad down to its studs at slashing costs regardless of the fallout. As our Board member, Claude Mageau demonstrated when he was CEO of Canadian National, a PSR operating model, when part of a customer-focused balanced strategy, can deliver top-tier revenue growth and a sub-60 operating ratio. - NSC 1Q24 Earnings Call

Norfolk Southern Corporation

If the company is able to lower its operating ratio to 66% by the end of this year, it could massively improve investor confidence.

As we turn to the balance of the year, we will see our margins improve materially from here. We are finally starting to see excess service costs unwind and they will accelerate downward in Q2. That trajectory, along with the reduction in non-agreement headcount as well as other productivity initiatives leave us confident in a strong productivity story for Q2. - NSC 1Q24 Earnings Call

While I wait for this turnaround to get support from better economic growth, I enjoy a 2.5% dividend. This may not be a juicy yield. However, it comes with a 46% payout ratio and a five-year CAGR of 10.2%.

Over the past ten years, this dividend has risen by 137%. The share count has been reduced by 27%.

Data by YCharts

Currently, NSC trades at a blended P/E ratio of 18.2x.

Analysts expect a 1% EPS recovery in 2024, potentially followed by 17% and 14% growth in 2025 and 2026, respectively.

FAST Graphs

This paves the way for a fair price target of $275, 28% above its current price.

On a longer-term basis, I'm much more bullish, as I expect NSC to go back to its old glory, especially if it gets a much-needed tailwind from economic growth.

While I have been buying gradually, I'm going to be a much more aggressive buyer *if* NSC drops to or below $200.

Zoetis (ZTS) - Undervalued Dividend Growth

Zoetis has become one of my favorite healthcare stocks. The former Pfizer (PFE) spin-off has become the world's largest producer of vaccines, medicines, diagnostics, and similar for animals.

Zoetis Inc.

The company's portfolio covers eight core species and seven therapeutic areas and holds 15 blockbuster drugs among roughly 300 product lines.

With regard to patent loss risks, the average market life of key brands in its portfolio is 30 years, including anti-infectives, dermatology, vaccines, pain and sedation, and others.

Zoetis Inc.

What matters is that the company holds the number one market share in:

North America, Latin America, and Asia.

Dermatology and pet pain.

Companion animals, cattle, and fish.

It has also consistently outperformed its peers, growing revenues by 8% annually since its IPO in 2013.

Zoetis Inc.

Through 2033, the company expects to maintain consistent growth, as it believes its total addressable market will grow by 4-6% annually to at least $75 billion by 2033.

Zoetis Inc.

It also has consistently grown its margins, which boosted adjusted net income by 109% in the 2017-2023 period.

Zoetis Inc.

With that said, ZTS is down 12% year-to-date, which was triggered by the news that its arthritis drug, Librela, could be harmful. I discussed this in an article published on April 14, when I went with the title ""Despite Lawsuit Risks: Why Zoetis Remains A Completing Investment.""

Since then, shares have rebounded 15%, beating the 6% return of the S&P 500.

While lawsuit risks are always an issue in healthcare, I believe these fears are overblown, allowing investors to buy ZTS at attractive prices.

Currently yielding 1.0%, Zoetis comes with a payout ratio of 29% and a five-year CAGR of 22.7%. It also has outperformed the market by a wide margin over the past ten years.

Data by YCharts

Moreover, the company, which enjoys anti-cyclical demand, is currently trading at a blended P/E ratio of 31.3x, which is slightly below its normalized P/E ratio of 31.7x. While this may seem like a lofty valuation, analysts expect 8-10% annual EPS growth to last, potentially paving the road for 10-11% annual returns.

FAST Graphs

As such, I stick to my buy rating and believe ZTS offers a great risk/reward for dividend growth investors seeking healthcare exposure in a market with strong long-term secular tailwinds.

With that said, if you're looking for a higher yield, the next pick may be for you.

Suncor Energy (SU) - A Dirt-Cheap Canadian Oil Play

Suncor is the largest peer of my investment in Canadian Natural Resources (CNQ). The company is one of the largest operators in Canada's oil sands and one of my favorite picks for income and capital gains.

The company has a number of benefits that I'm looking for in an oil company, which include deep reserves (more than 25 years of low-cost reserves), efficient operations in oil sands, and an increasing focus on shareholder distributions.

Suncor Energy

My most recent article on Suncor was written on May 19, when I called it ""One Of My Best Ideas In Energy."" Since then, it held a special call in May when it presented its long-term outlook.

During this call, it committed to an additional C$3.3 billion per year in free cash flow by the end of 2026, which translates to significant cash generation and shareholder returns.

This improvement comes with a targeted reduction in the company's WTI breakeven by $10 per barrel, which massively improves its free cash flow potential.

Suncor Energy

Moreover, it has revised its net debt target for its 100% free cash flow payout to C$8 billion. That is down from C$9 billion. As I wrote in my prior article, expectations are for C$8.6 billion in net debt by the end of this year, which makes it likely that Suncor will reach its debt target next year.

This bodes well for shareholders, as the company aims to deliver over C$40 billion of AFFO (adjusted funds from operations) from 2024 to 2026, with a 10% compound annual growth rate, translating to a 15% growth rate on a per-share basis.

Suncor Energy

Currently yielding 4.2%, the company aims to grow its dividend by 3-5% annually, with most shareholder returns coming from buybacks.

Given the company's favorable production outlook, in 2026, it could generate north of C$8 billion in free cash flow at $75 WTI. That translates to 12% of its market cap. This bodes very well for buybacks and total returns!

Suncor Energy

With regard to production, the company plans to increase upstream production by over 100,000 barrels per day while keeping controllable costs flat, which could potentially result in an 8% decline in operating cost per barrel over the next three years.

Suncor Energy

As I believe oil has much more room to rise than $75 WTI, I consider Suncor to be a ""hidden"" Canadian gem, which is perfect for a wide range of investors, including income and buyback-focused investors.

Please note that Suncor is listed both in Toronto and New York.

Valuation-wise, Suncor currently trades at a blended P/OCF (operating cash flow) ratio of just 5.3x, making it one of the cheapest energy stocks on my radar.

Applying an 8.5x multiple, the company has a fair stock price of C$92 in Toronto, 76% above the current price. The same applies to New York-listed shares.

FAST Graphs

Needless to say, I believe SU has a lot of room to run the moment energy bulls return, making it one of my top picks in the sector.

Takeaway

The S&P 500 has surged, mainly driven by tech giants and AI enthusiasm. This concentration poses a risk if the AI boom slows.

It also left other promising sectors undervalued.

In this article, we discussed three compelling dividend stocks: Norfolk Southern, Zoetis, and Suncor Energy.

Each offers unique advantages, from Norfolk's potential turnaround in the rail industry and Zoetis's leadership in animal healthcare to Suncor's massive potential in the energy sector.

I believe these picks provide a great risk/reward in the dividend (growth) space and offer value in what has become a very challenging market.","The S&P 500 just exited the first half of this year.
BloombergWhile this is great for people who simply own the S&P 500, it has created a very unusual situation, as the equal-weight S&P 500 has underperformed the market-weighted S&P 500 (the ""normal"" S&P 500) by the widest margin in the first six months of a year ever.

Overview

The market feels a bit more at ease after the first round of the French elections, as it seems that extreme policies will be avoided by an effort to deny the National Rally a legislative majority. French stocks have recouped some of their recent losses, and the euro reached $1.0775, its best level since June 13. The yen remains soft after the Tankan survey showed little change but an uptick in capex plans. Outside of the yen and Swiss franc, the dollar (DXY, USDOLLAR) is trading with a mostly softer bias. A handful of emerging market currencies are weaker today, including the Mexican peso. Central European currencies, though, a firmer in the wake of the euro's gains, but the South African rand is leading the emerging market currencies with nearly a 1% gain as a new government is falling into place.

Asia Pacific and European equities began the new month on a positive note. All the large bourses in the Asia Pacific region were higher, but Australia (AS51), after MSCI's regional index posted its first weekly advance since early June last week. Europe's Stoxx 600 (STOXX) is snapped its own four-day down draft today, helped by the bounce in French stocks. US index futures are narrowly mixed. Bonds are continuing their pre-weekend slide European yields are 2-8 bps higher, with core-peripheral spreads narrowing and the French premium over Germany narrowing by around five basis points. The 10-year US Treasury yield (US10Y) is firm near 4.41% after rising 14 bps last week. Gold is trading quietly (~$2318-$2330) after settling last month slightly below $2327. August WTI continues to probe the $82 area. It reached $82.70 before the weekend but closed near $81.40.

Asia Pacific

Japan's Tankan Survey was little changed from last quarter. Sentiment among large manufacturers ticked up, but there was no improvement for large non-manufacturers or smaller businesses. It did contain new information in terms of stronger capex plans (11.1% vs. 4.0% previously, missed expectations, 13.9%). It comes on the heels of the small increase in Tokyo's June CPI, which is a harbinger of the national report in a few weeks. At the end of the week, Japan will report May household spending. It rose in April (year-over-year) for the first time since February 2023. The combination of yen weakness and Governor Ueda's mission to normalize monetary policy suggests the risk is that both QT (fewer bond purchases than maturing issues) and a small rate hike are delivered at the end of the month. Minutes from the June RBA meetings are released tomorrow. They ought to be seen as a communication tool and the message from the meeting was that the central bank has not yet adopted an easing bias. Australia will report May retail sales on Wednesday. Wage growth and income tax cuts could boost consumption in the coming months. At the end of the week, Australia reports May merchandise trade. The surplus through April has fallen to about A$28 bln from around A$36.5 bln in the year-ago period. Exports have fallen by a cumulative 5.2%, while imports have risen by 2.9%. China's June PMI reading can only add to a pessimistic near-term economic outlook and underscore expectations for new action at the Third Plenum in the middle of the month. The composite PMI eased for the third consecutive month to 50.5, the lowest this year, from 51.0. Manufacturing remained at 49.5 for the second consecutive month in June. It was at 49.0 in June and December 2023. New orders and new exports are contracting. The non-manufacturing PMI fell to 50.5 from 51.1. This is also a new low for the year. The Caixin manufacturing PMI edged up to 51.8 from 51.7. It has not fallen since last October.

The dollar has held above JPY160 since breaking the barrier in the middle of last week. It reached almost JPY161.30 ahead of the weekend. It is trading inside Friday's range after trading on both sides of the previous day's trading range but settled slightly above Thursday's high. The market knows it is risking intervention in what is arguably a one-way market. The dollar has a three-week rally in tow, during which it has appreciated by about 2.25%. The Australian dollar also traded on both sides of Thursday’s range ahead of the weekend but settled within its range. It rallied from an eight-day low near $0.6620 and posted its highest close since June 3 (~$0.6675). It is trading firmly today but needs to convincingly break the $0.6600-$0.6700 range to be anything important. Meanwhile, yuan bears may be wary of official action in the offshore market and have been hesitant to push the dollar above CNH7.30. It is straddling that level for the fourth consecutive session. Chinese officials can engineer a squeeze in the offshore market by tightening liquidity, making it more expensive to short the yuan, and they could intervene directly. The PBOC set the dollar's reference rate at CNY7.1265 (CNY7.1268 on Friday). The central bank announced its intention to borrow bonds from primary dealers to sell to stem the decline in bond yields, which have fallen to record lows. The 10-year yield reached 2.18% today, while officials have suggested a 2.5%-3.5% range is appropriate.

Europe

The first round of the French elections gave Le Pen's National Rally a plurality of votes, but even with a generous look at round two, it most likely will not secure an outright majority after the second round this coming weekend. The markets have responded well. French stocks have rallied around 1.4% and the French 10-year premium over Germany has narrowed by about five basis points. Meanwhile, tomorrow the preliminary aggregate June CPI will be reported, and the year-over-year rate is likely to be little changed from May's 2.6%, but for the rounding. Before the weekend, France, Italy, and Spain reported their figures and today, German states have. The national figure is due shortly, and it looks to have risen a mild 0.1% for a 2.4% year-over-year pace (down from 2.5%). Eurozone consumer prices appear to have accelerated in Q2 (4.3-4.4% annualized vs. 4.0% in Q1). Looking further ahead, the base effect warns of a difficult second half. In H2 23, eurozone inflation rose at an annualized rate of less than 1%. May unemployment is due at the same time. This is a good story. Eurozone unemployment reached a record low of 6.4% in April. It was at 7.5% at the end of 2019. The tightening of monetary policy and the economic slowdown, which included a small contraction in H2 23. The labor market has fared better than anyone reasonably expected.

The euro traded last week in the lower end of June's range. It traded below $1.0675 on three occasions since mid-June, and found good buyers each time. Pre-weekend position squaring ensured the euro snapped a three-week fall but stalled near $1.0725. The results of the French election have seen the euro jump to about $1.0775, its best level since the day after US May CPI (June 12). The euro has found intraday support in early European activity near $1.0750. Nearby resistance is seen in the $1.0785-$1.0800 area. Sterling traded in a narrow range ahead of the weekend of a little more than a fifth of a cent in both directions around $1.2640. It was confined to less than a cent range last week. The $1.2600 area offers important support. Sterling is trading firmer but has held below $1.2690. On the topside, $1.2700-$1.2710 offers nearby resistance. Still, the potential may extend toward $1.2735-65 in the coming days.

America

North American participants have one eye on Thursday's holiday and one eye on Friday's jobs report. There is wood to be chopped first. On tap today, the ISM manufacturing is more important than the final PMI manufacturing survey (preliminary estimate rose to 51.7 from 51.3). Except for this past March, the ISM manufacturing diffusion index has been below 50 since October 2022. May construction spending is due, as well, and it fell in March and April. A 0.3% rise in May will nearly offset that decline. The highlight for Canada this week is also the employment report at the end of the week. Canada's unemployment rate is rising, and the Bank of Canada took advantage of the softer CPI measures to become the first G7 central bank to cut rates last month. The unemployment rate has risen from 5.7% in January to 6.2% in May. Canada created about 63k full-time jobs in the past five months. Mexico has a full schedule of economic reports this week, but the most market-sensitive data are today (May remittances and IMEF June survey) and tomorrow (June manufacturing PMI and April private consumption).

The US dollar posted an outside session ahead of the weekend against the Canadian dollar. It reversed from an eight-day-high near CAD1.3735 to CAD1.3655. Quarter-end position adjustments may have exacerbated the move, but the greenback still managed to settle within the previous day's range. Last week's low was near CAD1.3625. The greenback has not settled below CAD1.3600 since April 9. Canadian markets are closed today for Canada Day. The exchange rate is subdued today, and the greenback is in a narrow range (~CAD1.3665-CAD1.3690). The greenback also traded on both sides of Thursday's range against the Mexican peso ahead of the weekend. It also settled inside Thursday's range. Initially, the dollar reached a nine-day high against near MXN18.60 in the pre-weekend Asia Pacific session. It trended lower through Europe and the North American morning to approach MXN18.20 before bouncing back above MXN18.30. The US dollar is trading firmly today ~MXN18.2665-MXN18.4120) but within last Friday's range.

Seeking Alpha,https://seekingalpha.com/article/4701818-baytex-energy-clearwater-production-up-as-advertised?source=feed_all_articles,2024-07-01,11:22:54 UTC,Baytex Energy: Clearwater Production Up As Advertised (NYSE:BTE),"bashta

My previous article (and many before it) stated that the main benefit of acquiring oil light production would be the ability for Baytex Energy (NYSE:BTE) to safely increase the Clearwater heavy oil production without ""betting the company"". As the first quarter report showed, that indeed happened. It is likely to happen a whole lot more. Management will also likely make the acquired Eagle Ford operation more efficient. But the big news is the Clearwater production.

Baytex Energy Summary Of Production By Basin (Baytex Energy First Quarter 2024, Earnings Press Release And Reports Filed With Sedar)

The Peavine area noted above is where the Clearwater production is. As will be seen later, the Clearwater production is easily the most profitable production in the portfolio.

However, heavy oil production is a discounted product. That discount can widen during cyclical downturns such that the production needs to be shut in. Therefore, the profitability is only through part of the cycle. The Clearwater production may be low cost enough to survive a downturn while cash flowing. But that is highly speculative at this point. In the past, that has been a relative rarity as decent amounts of heavy oil production were shut in to prevent a negative (big negative) cash flow situation.

As a side note, management did sell some noncore Viking light oil production that likely lowered average costs as well.

Most of the production increase came from the light oil Eagle Ford production acquired in the United States.

Eagle Ford Acquisition Financial Effects

The Eagle Ford production acquisition likely caused a ""step-up"" in those assets that has dramatically increased the depreciation. This increase along with operations optimization procedures and related acquisition costs caused profits to evaporate, but not cash flows.

Baytex Energy Profitability Report By Country Before Corporate Expenses (Baytex Energy First Quarter 2024, Earnings Press Release And Reports Filed With Sedar)

The way this is done, the light oil United States production results in cash flows that will be protected through the acquisition valuation (and subsequent depreciation charge shown above). Note how much the depreciation increased, even though production did not go up anything close to that for United States depreciation. At least part of that is the accounting effects of the acquisition.

So, the more valuable light oil cash flows will be protected from taxes. On the other hand, it will be a bit of time before that segment shows adequate profits (after allocated expenses) because it does take time to optimize large acquisitions.

Clearwater Profitability

But this company has another way to profit immediately by using those cash flows to obtain a much larger return in the current environment.

Baytex Energy Portfolio Profitability By Drilling Area (Baytex Energy Corporate Presentation June 2024)

As shown above, the Clearwater area has by far the most profitable wells (I have ever seen for that matter). If it were not for the nature of the heavy oil profitability characteristics, the company could simply focus on heavy oil production and really forget the rest of the portfolio.

In the meantime, management essentially has a lottery ticket (that won) to higher profits as soon as management can mobilize the equipment. Investors can just bet that is happening as we speak. Already, the first quarter showed a big increase in production over the previous quarter in the comparison shown before. There is liable to be a lot more where that is coming from.

Cash Flow Opportunity

Management may even have the opportunity to increase cash flow even more:

Tamarack Valley Demonstration Of Clearwater Superior Profitability In Current Environment (Tamarack Valley Corporate Presentation February 2024)

More than one Clearwater operator is presenting that they are getting as many as 3 paybacks in roughly the current environment within 2 years (or sometimes less, depending on the operator). Baytex Energy shows a payback period of 10 months (which by the way is not bad). This operator, Tamarack Valley (OTCPK:TNEYF), has two payback periods in the first year while beginning a third payback period.

For Baytex Energy, this is a cash flow opportunity because cash is worth more now than later to any company (especially during a period of inflation). Tamarack Valley can drill two more wells in the same fiscal year to dramatically increase cash flow, while Baytex can drill one. Compounding could turn that into a huge cash flow build (rate) difference real fast.

Baytex Energy has spent considerable time advertising the largest wells in the basin (in terms of initial production). However, for shareholders, profits are likely more important than large initial production results.

Both companies report fantastic profitability. So, they do agree on that.

Summary

Baytex Energy has the opportunity to take the Eagle Ford cash flow (after maintaining and optimizing production) to go for a far greater return on its Clearwater project. Shareholders can win both from the optimizing of Eagle Ford production after the acquisition and the growth of Clearwater production.

Note that there is plenty of other production that is not as profitable. The other heavy oil production can be maintained so the leases do not expire (and the company loses control) while any growth goes to Clearwater.

This management, like others in the industry, is now finding other heavy oil areas where the latest technology can likewise be used for outrageous profits (until the next cyclical downturn).

Eagle Ford

The lowest cost light oil production is the Eagle Ford production. The acquisition likely increased the value of the non-managed leases where Marathon (MRO) is the operator. As a partner in those leases, Baytex as access to information that may well improve the acquired Eagle Ford results. Marathon is a well-known excellent operator in the basin.

The acquisition as also turned the company into an American light oil producer with heavy oil from a primarily Canadian producer which began in the heavy oil business. That may eventually mean a different valuation for the stock price now that it is listed on the NYSE.

Baytex Energy Summary Of Operating Progress Since Acquisition (Baytex Energy Corporate Presentation June 2024)

The trend shown on the upper right likely means that profitability of the wells is increasing. Texas has a huge natural gas surplus. This often means that operators pay as much or more than the posted price to get rid of natural gas production so they can produce oil. There are benchmark prices and there are operators getting those prices and making a profit on natural gas production. But those often tend to be the integrated majors or large producers that can negotiate because they have large volumes to deliver. Smaller producers in some areas (and that can vary widely by both area and producer) often have little negotiating leverage.

Even if producers get a decent price for natural gas, the oil production is far more profitable.

The production results shown above are not bad. The real question is how profitable the acquisition can be once management has things optimized. We probably will not know that for a couple of more quarters.

A side benefit is that now most of the Eagle Ford production is operated by the company. Before, all the Eagle Ford production was operated by Marathon. It could increase the overall valuation of the non-operated properties because every operator has non-operated wells. But operating control of most of the production is usually more highly valued by the market.

Summary

The light oil acquisition of Eagle Ford production has decent cash flow that will be protected by a big depreciation charge. How profitable that acquisition turns out to be remains to be seen. But it does allow management to develop the far more profitable Clearwater acreage right away, while it optimizes the Eagle Ford production. That is an unusual advantage for any acquisition.

Additionally, Baytex Energy may have the opportunity to improve the Clearwater cash flow by optimizing the length of the wells rather than going for the largest wells in the basin. Other operators seem to have a faster payback period. One example of that was given.

The issue remains a strong buy because Baytex Energy has the opportunity to come out ahead in several ways with that additional light oil production.

I would expect in the upcoming quarterly report that there will be material progress in Clearwater and also some reporting on the profitability improvement of Eagle Ford production. All of this could continue to lower the corporate breakeven point more and result in better than anticipated cash flow. This could mean debt repaid ahead of schedule and more future cash flow available to shareholders than currently anticipated.

The acquisition of the Eagle Ford production may turn out to be the best thing that management has done in some time. While any large acquisition takes time to get where it is going, this is one case where shareholders could see the benefits unfold immediately in the Clearwater area.

Risks

Any upstream company is subject to the volatility and low visibility of commodity prices. Any severe and sustained price downturn can be extremely painful for a company with an objective to pay down debt. There is some hedging to mitigate the risk. This company also has some very low-cost production that puts it in a far better position than many competitors. But a sustained commodity price downturn can change the outlook for the company or even prove to be fatal.

The loss of key personnel could set back the company's plans. In particular, the loss of Eagle Ford personnel when the company is headquartered in Canada could prove to be a particularly tough challenge.

Any acquisition can fail to meet expectations. This company has the Marathon information because it is a partner to Marathon, which helps with familiarity of the acreage and probably with best practices as well. That may well mitigate the risk.

The technology changes that periodically sweep the industry could stop ""tomorrow"". These changes often make acquisitions look better. But they can also cause the title of ""low-cost basin"" and ""low-cost acreage"" to change.

Growing up in Guatemala, Ruth Monrroy often spent time at her mother’s restaurant watching in awe of how she connected with customers.

“I knew I wanted to have my own business,” Mrs. Monrroy said on a recent weekday afternoon on Hollywood Boulevard, where her childhood wish has come true.

Mrs. Monrroy, 44, parks her metal cart in front of the TCL Chinese Theater six days a week, selling items including fruit salad, hot dogs and energy drinks.

“Mango, water, soda, Gatorade, hot dog!” she calls out to the crowds traipsing over Hollywood Walk of Fame stars dedicated to Bruce Willis and Billy Crystal.

Street vending is a quintessential California job — from the pickup trucks selling cartons of strawberries next to fields near Fresno to the pop-up stands offering carne asada tacos along Oakland thoroughfares. In Los Angeles alone, an estimated 10,000 street vendors sell food.

Until recently, vendors along Hollywood Boulevard were operating outside the law. And while that legal cloud has lifted, eking out a living remains a challenge. Cost-conscious tourists sometimes scoff at the prices, even if sellers struggle to break even. And while longtime street vendors respect and recognize the turf of other regulars, there are more sellers working in the area, and competition has increased.","“I knew I wanted to have my own business,” Mrs. Monrroy said on a recent weekday afternoon on Hollywood Boulevard, where her childhood wish has come true.

The Personal Consumption Expenditures index climbed 2.6 percent in May from a year earlier, matching what economists had forecast and down from 2.7 percent previously.

After stripping out volatile food and fuel prices to give a better sense of the inflation trend, a “core” price measure was also up 2.6 percent from a year earlier, down from 2.8 percent in the April reading. And on a monthly basis, inflation was especially mild, and prices did not climb on an overall basis.

The Fed is likely to watch the fresh inflation data closely as central bankers think about their next policy steps.

Trump took to social media to share one of his central economic philosophies: “Trade wars are good, and easy to win.”

As president, Mr. Trump presided over the biggest increase in U.S. tariffs since the Great Depression, hitting China, Canada, the European Union, Mexico, India and other governments with stiff levies. They hit back, imposing tariffs on American soybeans, whiskey, orange juice and motorcycles. U.S. agricultural exports plummeted, prompting Mr. Trump to send $23 billion to farmers to help offset losses.

Now, as he runs for president again, Mr. Trump is promising to ratchet up his trade war to a much greater degree. He has proposed “universal baseline tariffs on most foreign products,” including higher levies on certain countries that devalue their currency. In interviews, he has floated plans for a 10 percent tariff on most imports and a tariff of 60 percent or more on Chinese goods. He has also posited cutting the federal income tax and relying on tariffs for revenue instead.

Mr. Trump, who once proclaimed himself “Tariff Man,” has long argued that tariffs would boost American factories, end the gap between what America imported and what it exported and increase American jobs.","They hit back, imposing tariffs on American soybeans, whiskey, orange juice and motorcycles.

Eight-figure pay packages — rare a decade ago — are increasingly common for corporate lawyers at the top of their game, and many of these new heavy hitters have one thing in common: private equity.

In recent years, highly profitable private equity giants like Apollo, Blackstone and KKR have moved beyond company buyouts into real estate, private lending, insurance and other businesses, amassing trillions of dollars in assets. As their demand for legal services has skyrocketed, they have become big revenue drivers for law firms.

This is pushing up lawyers’ pay across the industry, including at some of Wall Street’s most prestigious firms, such as Kirkland & Ellis; Simpson Thacher & Bartlett; Davis Polk; Latham & Watkins; and Paul, Weiss, Rifkind, Wharton & Garrison. Lawyers with close ties to private equity increasingly enjoy pay and prestige similar to those of star lawyers who represent America’s blue-chip companies and advise them on high-profile mergers, takeover battles and litigation.","Hotshot Wall Street lawyers are now so in demand that bidding wars between firms for their services can resemble the frenzy among teams to sign star athletes.

Netflix greenlit more scripted television projects through the first quarter of this year than in any quarter since 2022, according to Ampere Analysis, a research firm. Amazon had its most active quarter since Ampere started tracking market activity five years ago, the firm said.

Many of their competitors are still taking a more cautious approach. As a result, Netflix and Amazon collectively accounted for 53 percent of the scripted television series orders among the major studios through the first three months of the year, according to Ampere.","It has been nearly seven months since Hollywood resolved its strikes, but momentum still hasn’t taken hold in the entertainment industry.

It’s Not Enough.,"Four months ago, China’s leaders announced what seemed like a straightforward and proven plan to recharge the economy: Subsidize consumers who want to replace old cars and household appliances.

The early results are not promising.

Only 113,000 cars qualified for trade-in subsidies through June 25 — a blip in a country where monthly sales exceed two million cars. And buyers of new appliances such as washing machines and refrigerators are being offered discounts of only about 10 percent, depending on what city they live in.

The incentives are not enough to bring customers into stores.

“If it is not needed, people will not go out of their way to find an old machine to participate,” said Dai Yu, the manager of an appliance store in Jingdezhen, a city in Jiangxi Province in south-central China.

The idea of providing financial incentives to spur consumer spending is not new.

In 2009, the United States, Germany, France, Spain and Austria offered so-called cash for clunkers programs to revive car sales. They paid households to scrap gas guzzlers and replace them with newer cars with better fuel economy. China itself gave extensive tax cuts and subsidies for consumers to buy new cars and household appliances. Prices for many appliances were cut in half, particularly for rural residents, and sales surged.","Four months ago, China’s leaders announced what seemed like a straightforward and proven plan to recharge the economy: Subsidize consumers who want to replace old cars and household appliances.

In buying Spirit, Boeing hopes to stem quality problems that have plagued the supplier in recent years. While it already has significant influence over Spirit, Boeing will more easily be able to monitor and change production practices by owning the business outright. Boeing has taken internal steps to improve quality, too, after a harrowing incident in which a panel blew out of one of its planes on a flight in January.

“By reintegrating Spirit,” Boeing’s chief executive, Dave Calhoun, said in a statement, the company “can fully align” its production and safety systems with its work force.

The deal, which was widely expected, was valued at $4.7 billion in stock or $8.3 billion including Spirit’s debt. It must be approved by regulators and Spirit’s shareholders to be completed. Boeing will also spin off portions of Spirit to Airbus, its European rival, as part of the transaction. Boeing said its acquisition of Spirit is expected to close by the middle of next year.","Boeing said on Monday that it had agreed to buy a major supplier, Spirit AeroSystems, ending a nearly two-decade experiment in outsourcing production of major components of its commercial planes, including the body of the 737 Max and parts of the 767, 777 and 787.

She spent summers getting ready to show cattle at the county fair. During the school year, she rushed home after class to feed the chickens on her family’s corn and soybean farm. Neither of her parents went to college, but they encouraged their daughter when she decided to go to Carleton, a liberal arts school a two-hour drive from their farm in Minnesota.

Despite being physically close to home, Ms. Lunz Trujillo was surprised by how foreign her upbringing seemed at the college. She was dismayed when she checked out the farm club and learned that its members wanted to brew kombucha, not milk cows. When an art history teacher asked students which famous paintings they’d seen in person, Ms. Lunz Trujillo stayed quiet, because she had never been to an art museum. This sense of cultural alienation molded her research when she became a political scientist: What is rural identity? How does it shape a person’s politics?

So Detroit Is Making Changes.,"In January 2020, Robert Williams spent 30 hours in a Detroit jail because facial recognition technology suggested he was a criminal. The match was wrong, and Mr. Williams sued.

On Friday, as part of a legal settlement over his wrongful arrest, Mr. Williams got a commitment from the Detroit Police Department to do better. The city adopted new rules for police use of facial recognition technology that the American Civil Liberties Union, which represented Mr. Williams, says should be the new national standard.

“We hope that it moves the needle in the right direction,” Mr. Williams said.

Mr. Williams was the first person known to be wrongfully arrested based on faulty facial recognition. But he wasn’t the last. The Detroit police arrested at least two other people as a result of facial recognition searches gone awry, including a woman who was charged with carjacking when she was eight months pregnant.

Law enforcement agencies across the country use facial recognition technology to try to identify criminals whose misdeeds are caught on camera. In Michigan, the software compares an unknown face to those in a database of mug shots or drivers’ license photos. In other jurisdictions, the police use tools, like Clearview AI, that search through photos scraped from social media sites and the public internet.","In January 2020, Robert Williams spent 30 hours in a Detroit jail because facial recognition technology suggested he was a criminal.

The shock waves from last week’s presidential debate are still reverberating, as President Biden and his aides sought to allay concerns from despondent Democrats and wealthy donors about his age and fitness for office.

Donors are increasingly becoming reconciled to Biden remaining the Democratic nominee even after Biden’s disastrous performance. But some in the party, and in the markets, are increasingly expecting Donald Trump to win in November.

Here’s the latest fallout from the debate. Seventy-two percent of registered voters don’t believe Biden has the mental and cognitive health to serve as president, according to a CBS News poll published Sunday, compared with 65 percent in early June.

With the odds for a Trump win rising after the debate, Wall Street analysts are recalculating what that could mean for the economy and the markets. Among their forecasts are a slowdown in growth and resurgence in inflation that could muddle the Fed’s interest rate policy, especially if Trump carries out his proposals for mass deportation of undocumented migrants and higher tariffs.","Donors still on edgeThe shock waves from last week’s presidential debate are still reverberating, as President Biden and his aides sought to allay concerns from despondent Democrats and wealthy donors about his age and fitness for office.

Shields’s candidacy was a surprise, even to herself. But when Kate Shindle, who had led the union for nine years, announced in April that she was stepping down, Shields’s music director suggested she consider the opening, and soon enough, she had tossed her hat in the ring, and in May she won the vote by members, defeating two more-seasoned labor activists. She’s already led her first meeting of the union’s council, and came away realizing she has a lot to learn, starting with parliamentary procedure.

Shields, of course, is one of those people who has been famous for so long, and in so many ways, that even she can’t remember a different time. She was a childhood model, a preteen movie star, a sex object and an icon of beauty, all before she went off to college (Princeton, thank you very much). In the years since, she has acted onscreen and onstage, has written books, has spoken widely, particularly about depression, and has become a symbol and a subject for an evolving discussion about how women and girls have been sexualized by the entertainment and fashion industries.","Brooke Shields has a new office.

We don’t yet have “Madoff: The Musical,” but years after his 2021 death from kidney disease in a federal prison hospital, Bernie the Ponzi-scheming potentate keeps yielding cultural dividends. An experimental film shown at Lincoln Center. A Netflix documentary series, “The Monster of Wall Street.” And now, adding to a fat stack that includes a coloring book and an exposé by a New York Times reporter that generated its own Robert De Niro movie, a new prose probe entitled “Madoff: The Final Word.”

Final? As its own author, Richard Behar, admits: doubtful.

A longtime investigative journalist who has taken on, among other formidable institutions, the litigious Church of Scientology, Behar spent 15 years seemingly half-shackled to and half-tickled by this, his first book. Along with many, many secondary interviews, he visited Madoff in prison thrice; talked to him on the phone about 50 times; and received from him dozens of handwritten letters and hundreds of emails.(He’s far from the first or only reporter to have visited the man in the clink, but the passage of time has loosened some auxiliary tongues — though death has stilled others.)

For every dollar he stole, Madoff seems to have generated at least one piece of regular paper. The hoard of 30 million documents he didn’t manage to destroy, Behar writes, “is nearly half the size of the printed material collection of the U.S. Library of Congress.” The shredding operation Madoff ran starting in the mid-90s, in a Brooklyn facility now called Tuck-It-Away, was like an A.S.M.R. orgy: burlap bags of the scraps taken to a nearby recycling plant, his secrets “dissolving to mulch.”","MADOFF: The Final Word, by Richard BeharWe don’t yet have “Madoff: The Musical,” but years after his 2021 death from kidney disease in a federal prison hospital, Bernie the Ponzi-scheming potentate keeps yielding cultural dividends.

Kim Scott, a former Google executive and the author of “Radical Candor,” described the sentiment of human resources executives who were at a recent gathering: “They are dreading this election because it’s going to kill productivity for months.”

Experiment Yields Some ‘Good News.’,"Ever since scientists discovered influenza infecting American cows earlier this year, they have been puzzling over how it spreads from one animal to another. An experiment carried out in Kansas and Germany has shed some light on the mystery.

Scientists failed to find evidence that the virus can spread as a respiratory infection. Juergen Richt, a virologist at Kansas State University who helped lead the research, said that the results suggested that the virus is mainly infectious via contaminated milking machines.

In an interview, Dr. Richt said that the results offered hope that the outbreak could be halted before the virus evolved into a form that could spread readily between humans.

“I think this is good news that we can most likely control it easier than people thought,” Dr. Richt said. “Hopefully we can now kick this thing in the behind and knock it out.”","Ever since scientists discovered influenza infecting American cows earlier this year, they have been puzzling over how it spreads from one animal to another.

Many of the 40 or so journalists (myself included) who showed up had barely heard of him.

Still, it was hard to ignore his pitch. Three days earlier, we had received an email promising a “previously unseen classified video” with “dramatic proof and new facts.”

But even this bit of hype might have undersold what happened after the man, Julian Assange, pressed play. The nature of proof — the volume and granularity of digital evidence, along with the pathways through which it comes to light — was about to change.

Before, information that leaked from insiders to the public was largely circumscribed by the limitations of paper.

Trump.

The prime-time bout, organized by CNN and simulcast on more than a dozen networks, was easily the most-viewed moment of the 2024 presidential campaign, the sort of mass civic gathering that is increasingly rare in a choose-your-own-news era of media. And the figure released on Friday by Nielsen, which mostly measures traditional TV sets, did not include the likely millions more who watched on digital news sites and social media platforms.

The size of the TV audience — similar to that for an N.F.L. conference championship game — could be grim news for the Biden campaign, given the shaky and stumbling performance by the president, which set off panic in the upper echelons of the Democratic Party.

But viewership was also down 30 percent from the first Biden-Trump debate in September 2020, which notched more than 73 million viewers. Nielsen said Thursday’s matchup in Atlanta was the lowest-rated general-election debate since the final meeting of George W. Bush and John Kerry in 2004.","The numbers are in: 51.3 million Americans tuned in live to watch Thursday night’s televised debate between President Biden and former President Donald J. Trump.

The recalculations are necessary because key parts of President Biden’s new student loan repayment program, SAVE, were temporarily blocked by two federal judges on Monday, just a week before many borrowers’ payments were scheduled to be reduced by as much as half.

The judges, in Kansas and Missouri, issued separate preliminary injunctions this week, leaving the SAVE plan’s eight million enrollees in limbo until lawsuits, filed in the spring by two groups of Republican-led states seeking to topple the program, are resolved. The Justice Department recently filed a request on behalf of the Education Department to stop the Kansas injunction.

“If the injunction takes effect,” the filing said, “it will inflict irreparable harm on the federal government in the form of unrecoverable disruption costs and create extraordinary confusion and chaos for borrowers.”","Roughly three million borrowers with federal student loans will see their monthly payments paused in the coming days, as the Biden administration tries to recalculate their bills to comply with a federal court order in Kansas.

The deal will help Rivian, which has never turned a quarterly profit, make more electric vehicles and help convince investors of its stability. It will provide Volkswagen with the software expertise that auto analysts say it sorely lacks. And it’s a bet by Volkswagen, which could become a large shareholder of Rivian if regulators approve the deal, that Rivian will meet its promise of becoming “the next Tesla,” something that has so far proved elusive.

Rivian, which was founded in 2009 as Mainstream Motors, had billions in investments by 2021, including from Amazon, BlackRock and Ford.

But as the case with many new electric vehicle companies, Rivian has also experienced hiccups in trying to ramp up to production, made harder by supply chain issues during the pandemic.

People worried about bills, feeling overwhelmed about overspending or concerned about money management may expect a “money talk” to lead to an argument, so they avoid bringing up the topic, according to a report from researchers at Cornell University and Yale University, published this month in The Journal of Consumer Psychology. Yet prior research has found that communicating about money helps couples spend more responsibly and better manage their debt.

“They anticipate conflict, so they’re choosing not to have these conversations at all,” said Emily Garbinsky, associate professor of marketing and management communication at Cornell’s business school and one of the study’s authors.

Why is it so difficult for some people to talk about money with their partners in the first place?

Aja Evans, a financial therapist in New York, said people may feel ashamed that they are having money troubles. They may worry that talking about such things with their partner will hurt their relationship.

The company, Kobayashi Pharmaceutical, in March had reported five deaths potentially linked to its CholesteHelp rice and red-yeast pills. Japanese government health officials said the supplement, which claimed to help reduce cholesterol, contained puberulic acid, a highly toxic compound that is a product of mold.

In response to the sudden surge in reported deaths, Health Minister Keizo Takemi said it was “extremely regrettable” that Kobayashi Pharmaceutical had not updated the ministry sooner. The company, which is based in Osaka, had not provided new information on deaths potentially linked to CholesteHelp since March.

Since then, Kobayashi Pharmaceutical has received reports that 1,656 people sought medical advice for CholesteHelp-related health concerns, and 289 people have been hospitalized, the company reported.

He was 77.

The cause was cancer, said Brad Turell, a family spokesman.

Mr. Kellner was one of the most successful television executives of his generation. His knack for capturing young viewers — first men at Fox, then women at WB — lured viewers away from the Big Three networks that had ruled television for nearly 40 years.

Mr. Kellner believed that ABC, NBC and CBS were ignoring viewers under 35 and were hamstrung by middle-of-the-road taste. Rupert Murdoch, the owner of Fox Inc., and Barry Diller, its chairman, recruited Mr. Kellner from the television syndication business in 1986 and installed him as president of the Fox Broadcasting Company.

Its aspiration to be the first new TV network since ABC in 1948 was broadly derided.

Rupert Murdoch, the owner of Fox Inc., and Barry Diller, its chairman, recruited Mr. Kellner from the television syndication business in 1986 and installed him as president of the Fox Broadcasting Company.
Its aspiration to be the first new TV network since ABC in 1948 was broadly derided.","['wb', 'fox', 'started', 'tv', 'television', 'network', 'mr', 'helped', 'dies', 'family', 'broadcasting', 'executive', 'kellner', 'jamie', '77', 'viewers']",https://static01.nyt.com/images/2024/06/30/multimedia/26Kellner-03-bclq-print1/26Kellner-03-bclq-facebookJumbo.jpg,False,jami kellner media execut help build fox broadcast thrive televis network show like `` bever hill `` `` the simpson '' -- went creat wb network known angsti `` dawson 's creek '' `` buffi vampir slayer '' -- die june home montecito calif near santa barbara caus cancer said brad turel famili spokesman mr kellner one success televis execut generat knack captur young viewer -- first men fox women wb -- lure viewer away big three network rule televis near year mr kellner believ abc nbc cbs ignor viewer hamstrung middleoftheroad tast rupert murdoch owner fox inc barri diller chairman recruit mr kellner televis syndic busi instal presid fox broadcast compani aspir first new tv network sinc abc broad derid debut first seri lowbrow famili sitcom `` marri ... children '' shown six murdochown station string independ one mr kellner help stitch togeth new network began steal big three 's audienc

The truth is that they spend most of their time trying to minimize risk.

It’s why theaters are clogged with vacuous sequels. It’s why so many Hollywood power players hide behind P.R. people. And it’s why all of the big movie studios and streaming services — and, in fact, most indie film companies — declined to distribute “The Apprentice,” a dramatized origin story about Donald J. Trump that the former president has called “malicious defamation” and showered with cease-and-desist letters.

But the movie business still has at least one wildcatter: Tom Ortenberg.

Mr. Ortenberg, 63, and his Briarcliff Entertainment are pushing to complete a deal to acquire “The Apprentice” for wide release in theaters in the United States in September or early October — close enough to the presidential election to bask in its heat, but far enough away to avoid final-stretch media overload. Briarcliff’s pursuit of the $16 million film was confirmed by five people involved with the sale process, who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss a private negotiation.

“Tom’s got more courage than most people in Hollywood combined,” said Stephen Galloway, the dean of Chapman University’s film school. “His interest in this kind of movie involves business, of course. He sees money to be made by leveraging millions of dollars in free publicity. But part of it is wanting to do his bit. He’s liberal and cares about social issues.”","The truth is that they spend most of their time trying to minimize risk.

Founded in 1979 and distinguished by its commitment to presenting work by living American writers, Second Stage said that its board had chosen Evan Cabnet as its next artistic director. Cabnet is currently the artistic director of LCT3, Lincoln Center Theater’s program for emerging writers, directors and designers. Cabnet will succeed Carole Rothman, one of the theater’s founders, who led the organization for 45 years and is stepping down in August.

Second Stage has a proud history of presenting acclaimed work, including the Pulitzer-winning shows “Between Riverside and Crazy,” “Water by the Spoonful” and “Next to Normal.” Its plays and musicals have won multiple other honors; most recently, the organization’s production of “Appropriate” won this year’s Tony Award for best play revival.

Second Stage owns Broadway’s smallest house, the 600-seat Hayes Theater. Like many nonprofit theaters, Second Stage has reduced its footprint since the pandemic — it let go of its Off Off Broadway space on the Upper West Side, and at the end of this year is letting go of its Off Broadway venue in Times Square, although it plans to continue to produce such work in other spaces, starting next spring at the Pershing Square Signature Center. The organization currently has 47 staffers and an annual budget of $27 million; this season it is planning to stage two Broadway shows, two Off Broadway shows and a Next Stage Festival for early-career work.","Second Stage Theater, one of the four nonprofit organizations with Broadway houses, on Thursday named a new artistic director as the sector braces for a wave of leadership turnover.

All eyes will be on CNN at 9 p.m. Eastern, when President Biden and Donald Trump face off in their first debate since 2020. Among the keenest watchers will be executives and investors looking for signs about how the candidates might handle the economy and business in a second term.

There will be plenty to scrutinize in the 90-minute, audience-free debate, including what the candidates say and how they say it. Here’s what we will be looking out for. (And, for a lighter take, check out our debate “bingo card” further below.)

The economy is the big question. Various measures show strong growth under Biden, but many voters feel differently. What will Biden and Trump say about some of the key issues?

Inflation: This is clearly a challenge for the president, as Americans complain about what they’re paying in the grocery store, at the pump and on their rent. Biden can say that price increases are slowing down, and will most likely emphasize his administration’s efforts to crack down on “corporate greed,” like taking on so-called junk fees. Trump will probably stress how good things were when he took office in 2017 — an economy many Americans want back.

Taxes: Biden’s proposals for higher corporate taxes will hit profits: “It’s simple math,” David Bahnsen, the founder and chief investment officer of the Bahnsen Group, told DealBook. Many business leaders don’t like Biden’s plan to increase taxes on the wealthy, either. Trump will probably stress his desire to extend his 2017 tax cuts and lower the corporate rate to 20 percent. But questions about corporate earnings and the economy may eclipse those concerns.

Protectionism: Both candidates want to increase tariffs on Chinese goods, but Biden has been more targeted in how he has done it during his presidency. Trump has proposed significantly higher across-the-board levies, though it’s unclear how serious he is about it. Economists have warned that Trump’s potential approach could aggravate inflation and hurt the economy.

Markets: The S&P 500 set 31 records this year; investors will hope neither party messes with that momentum. In Thursday night’s debate, “markets probably care more about presentation than policy pledges,” Paul Donovan, an economist at UBS, wrote in a client note. Biden may have a slight edge, he added, since investors would prefer keeping “some continuity.”

Other issues will probably feature prominently. Biden will most likely raise abortion rights, a topic that has helped Democrats win in recent elections. Trump will almost certainly speak a lot about immigration, perhaps his most potent issue — and one that many, including Elon Musk, say is a failure of Biden’s.

The intangibles will matter. Executives told DealBook that C.E.O.s will be paying attention to how Biden and Trump perform:

For Biden, 81, an important issue for business leaders and many voters is whether he is still fit to serve. A sharp, forceful performance could go a ways in quieting any concerns.

For Trump, 78, competence is a question as well. But his demeanor will also be under scrutiny, especially if he comes across as overly abrasive or erratic. Some executives said their feelings would come down to whether they can stomach another four years of a Trump presidency.

There’s also the show around the show. Trump has suggested that his potential running mate would be in Atlanta for the debate. The Times reports that his list is narrowing, with Senator J.D. Vance of Ohio, Gov. Doug Burgum of North Dakota and Senator Marco Rubio of Florida being of particular interest.","Talking pointsAll eyes will be on CNN at 9 p.m. Eastern, when President Biden and Donald Trump face off in their first debate since 2020.
Among the keenest watchers will be executives and investors looking for signs about how the candidates might handle the economy and business in a second term.

Addressing reporters at a company factory in Renton, Wash., Elizabeth Lund, a Boeing executive, provided new details on Tuesday about how the plane involved in the incident left the plant apparently without four critical bolts that secured the panel, known as a door plug, in place.

Boeing said the information was not for release until Thursday morning, under a common kind of agreement that allowed the attending reporters time to process the detailed briefing.

But the National Transportation Safety Board became aware of the remarks at the briefing and rebuked the company hours before articles on the remarks were published. It said that Boeing improperly shared investigative information and speculated about the cause of the incident, adding that the company had “blatantly violated” the agency’s rules surrounding active investigations. The agency said it would provide details about that violation to the Justice Department, which is investigating the January flight.","Boeing drew fresh criticism from a federal regulator on Thursday over disclosures about the continuing investigation into a harrowing January flight during which one of the company’s 737 Max planes lost a panel, exposing passengers to howling winds at an altitude of about 16,000 feet.

I am a single American mother living in Jordan and working for the United Nations. In September 2019, I adopted my then 5-year-old son from China, and promised him we would return to visit his country every year. But the pandemic broke out. When China finally reopened to tourists in 2023, we got visas and booked a July flight to Beijing via Doha on Qatar Airways, paying about $1,400 total. My now 9-year-old had worked hard to maintain his language and was excited, but nervous. At that time, the Chinese government required passengers to fill out a “Health Declaration Form” in advance or upon arrival. The link on the Qatar Airways website was broken, but I confirmed online and with friends who had recently traveled to China that I could fill it out upon arrival. At the airport, Qatar Airways disagreed, and when I once again couldn’t get the form to work, we were denied boarding. My son collapsed on the airport floor, sobbing. I rebooked for the next day, and we flew to Beijing via Istanbul on Royal Jordanian and China Southern for $1,882. Neither airline requested to see the QR code showing my form had been approved: All passengers upon arrival were made to fill out new forms. Qatar Airways mostly refunded the tickets — we received $1,185 — but refused to admit it was wrong. Considering the more expensive last-minute flight and other costs (such as rebooking domestic flights and trains in China) we are out about $930. I believe the airline should provide a flight voucher that compensates us for that amount. Can you help? Elizabeth, Amman, Jordan

Dear Elizabeth,

Your run-in with the complex world of international travel documentation was especially devastating because of the emotional stakes this trip represented for your family. But confusion over documentation leads to denied boarding “thousands of times a day,” said Max Tremaine, the chief executive of Sherpa, a company that maintains a database of international entrance requirements for travelers.

Not to excuse Qatar Airways for what I will charitably call a vigorous over-enforcement of the rules, but those frontline airline workers facing long lines at check-in can have a difficult task, making snap judgments on whether travelers have sufficient documents or not.

Countries all have their own entry rules depending on the passports that travelers hold and where they are coming from, and airlines are fined when they mistakenly allow people to fly. The decision may be straightforward when their customers are an American family with valid passports headed direct from New York to London for a week’s vacation. But travel can be complicated — consider, say, when a Dutch banker is on his way to Bangladesh via Cairo or an Australian trapeze artist with a one-way ticket heads to a performance in Kyrgyzstan through Frankfurt.The pandemic only complicated this complicated system. In your situation, your itinerary had you going through Qatar Airways’ hub in Doha, meaning those behind you in line in Jordan were probably headed to dozens of countries, all with their own rules.","When China finally reopened to tourists in 2023, we got visas and booked a July flight to Beijing via Doha on Qatar Airways, paying about $1,400 total.

Part of retirement planning includes determining how much to save and invest so you can enjoy the type of lifestyle you desire. Setting your savings target by age can be a good way to organize your strategy and gauge how to track progress with your goals. You might also be interested in how much the typical retiree has saved at age 65, 70 and beyond. In this article, we’re going to focus on how much the average person has saved and possibly should have saved at the age of 70. Keep in mind, though, that your situation is still completely unique to what your goals are. You may want to work with a financial advisor to make sure your savings goals are in line with where you need to be later on.

How Much Does the Average 70-Year-Old Have in Savings?

According to data from the Federal Reserve’s most recent Survey of Consumer Finances, the average 65 to 74-year-old has a little over $426,000 saved. That’s money that’s specifically set aside in retirement accounts, including 401(k) plans and IRAs.

The Federal Reserve also measures median and mean (average) savings across other types of financial assets. According to the data, the average 70-year-old has approximately:

$60,000 in transaction accounts (including checking and savings)

$127,000 in certificate of deposit (CD) accounts

$17,000 in savings bonds

$43,000 in cash value life insurance

In terms of overall trends, the numbers show an increase over the previous Survey of Consumer Finances. According to that survey, the average 65 to 75-year-old had $381,000 saved for retirement in 2016. That figure, however, was well below the $486,000 70-year-olds had saved on average in 2013.

Whether the Survey of Consumer Finances for 2022 shows an uptick in savings or a decline remains to be seen. While Social Security benefits have seen several cost-of-living increases since the last survey was completed, persistently high inflation has put more pressure on Americans’ spending power. The survey may show that 70-year-olds have less in retirement savings if they’re spending more to compensate for higher prices.

If you’re ready to be matched with local advisors that can help you achieve your financial goals, get started now .

How Much Should a 70-Year-Old Have in Savings?

Financial experts generally recommend saving anywhere from $1 million to $2 million for retirement. If you consider an average retirement savings of $426,000 for those in the 65 to 74-year-old range, the numbers obviously don’t match up.

The amount a 70-year-old should save for retirement can depend on several things, including:

Story continues

Desired retirement lifestyle

When they apply for Social Security benefits

Other sources of retirement income, such as a 401(k), IRA, pension or annuity

Other savings, including taxable brokerage accounts, savings accounts and CDs

Overall health and life expectancy

The more money you anticipate spending to cover your cost of living in retirement, the more you’ll typically need to save. Social Security benefits are a staple part of many retirees’ income picture, but those payments may only go so far. Pensions, meanwhile, are becoming more of a rarity as employers opt for defined contribution plans instead.

Long-term care can put a strain on retiree budgets and increase the amount of money you need to save. Medicare doesn’t cover long-term care though Medicaid does. But to qualify for Medicaid, you’ll typically need to spend down your assets. Purchasing long-term care insurance can be a workaround so you’re not at risk of draining your savings.

What Is a Good Net Worth at 70?

how much does the average 70-year-old have in savings

Net worth is a measure of your assets vs. your liabilities. In other words, it’s the difference between what you own and what you owe.

The average net worth of Americans aged 65 to 74 hovers around $1.2 million. The median net worth is lower, at $164,000. The typical 70-year-old has around $105,000 in debt, including mortgages, home equity loans, credit cards and student loans, as measured by the Fed’s data.

What constitutes a good net worth is situation-specific and largely linked to your retirement goals. There are different rules of thumb you can apply to come up with an ideal net worth calculation. For example, one rule suggests having a net worth at 70 that’s equivalent to 20 times your annual expenses.

If you spend $100,000 a year to live in retirement, you should have a net worth of at least $2 million. On the other hand, if you only spend $40,000 on living expenses, then your target net worth would be much lower, at $800,000.

Is Retiring at 70 a Good Idea?

Whether it makes sense to retire at 70 can depend on your finances and what you envision for your dream retirement. When choosing a retirement age, it’s helpful to consider:

When you’ll really need to take Social Security benefits

Whether you’ll still work in a part-time capacity after retiring

How long you plan to live in retirement

Your desired savings goal and current savings rate

If you can delay taking Social Security benefits until age 70, that can boost your benefit amount. You’ll be eligible to collect 132% of your benefit amount by waiting longer to apply.

You can also continue saving and investing for retirement if you’re working longer. For example, you can continue maxing out your 401(k) each year, or at the very least, contribute enough to get your full employer match. You can also funnel money into an IRA for supplemental savings.

Retiring at 70 means you’ll have a two-year gap before you’ll need to begin taking required minimum distributions (RMDs) from a traditional 401(k). You’ll also need to take RMDs if you have a Roth 401(k), but Roth IRAs are exempt from this rule.

Within that window, you might decide to convert your traditional IRA to a Roth account. Doing so can mean a higher tax bill in the year of the conversion since you’re required to pay taxes on your traditional IRA earnings. But moving forward, you’d be able to take tax-free distributions from your Roth IRA.

The Bottom Line

how much does the average 70-year-old have in savings

How much does the average 70-year-old have in savings? Just shy of $500,000, according to the Federal Reserve. The better question, however, may be whether that’s enough for a 70-year-old to live on in retirement so that you can align your budget accordingly. With no end to higher inflation in sight, retiring on $500,000 may not be realistic for everyone. The good news is that the younger you are, the more time you have to plan, save and invest for the future.

Retirement Planning Tips

Consider talking to your financial advisor about the pros and cons of retiring at 70 and what your personal timeline for retirement should look like. If you don’t have a financial advisor yet, finding one doesn’t have to be hard. SmartAsset’s free tool matches you with up to three financial advisors who serve your area, and you can interview your advisor matches at no cost to decide which one is right for you. If you’re ready to find an advisor who can help you achieve your financial goals, get started now.

Delaying Social Security benefits could help you to collect more money in retirement. Taking benefits early, however, could reduce your monthly payment amount. The earliest you can begin taking Social Security is age 62 but it may benefit you to wait until at least your full retirement age to apply. Also, keep in mind that if you do decide to take Social Security early and you continue to work, your benefit amount may be reduced even further. Understanding how to maximize Social Security benefits can help you get the most money possible.

Keep an emergency fund on hand in case you run into unexpected expenses. An emergency fund should be liquid — in an account that isn't at risk of significant fluctuation like the stock market. The tradeoff is that the value of liquid cash can be eroded by inflation. But a high-interest account allows you to earn compound interest. Compare savings accounts from these banks.

Yahoo Finance,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/1-stock-split-stock-confidently-090600417.html,2024-07-01,09:06:00 UTC,"1 Stock-Split Stock You Can Confidently Buy for the Second Half of 2024, and 2 to Avoid","With the exception of artificial intelligence (AI), there's not a hotter trend on Wall Street right now than companies conducting stock splits.

A stock split is an event where a publicly traded company cosmetically alters its share price and outstanding share count by the same magnitude. It's ""cosmetic"" in the sense that changing a company's share price and share count by the same factor has no effect on its market cap or operating performance.

Image source: Getty Images.

There are two types of stock splits: forward and reverse. With a forward-stock split, companies are angling to make their shares more nominally affordable for retail investors who might not have access to fractional-share purchases with their broker. Meanwhile, a reverse-stock split aims to increase a company's share price, often with the goal of ensuring it meets the minimum continued listing standards on a major stock exchange.

Most investors tend to favor forward-stock splits, because the companies enacting forward splits are typically out-innovating and out-executing their peers.

Since 2024 began, nine high-profile stocks have announced or completed a stock split. However, not all of these stock-split stocks share the same outlook. As we motor into the second half of 2024, one of these stock-split stocks stands out as a phenomenal deal for patient investors, while two others are worth avoiding.

Stock-split stock No. 1 that's worth avoiding in the second half of 2024: Nvidia

In spite of its undeniable popularity, AI juggernaut Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA) is the first stock-split I'd suggest investors purposefully avoid for the final six months of 2024. Nvidia announced a 10-for-1 forward split on May 22, which was completed on June 7.

Although I'm no fan of Nvidia from an investment perspective, I'm happy to give the company credit where it's due. Nvidia's AI-graphics processing units (GPUs) have set the standard in high-compute data centers. According to semiconductor analysis firm TechInsights, it was responsible for 98% of the 3.85 million AI-GPUs that were shipped last year. Having first-mover and compute advantages over its peers has given the company substantial pricing power.

But this is where the praise ends and history works its way back into the discussion.

Since the advent of the internet in the mid-1990s, there hasn't been a buzzy innovation, technology, or trend that avoided an early stage euphoria-bursting event. This is to say that investors have overestimated the adoption and/or utility of every next-big-thing innovation or technology for 30 years (including the internet itself). While this doesn't mean artificial intelligence and Nvidia can't be wildly successful over the long run, the simple fact that most businesses lack a concrete plan for AI suggests a bubble is brewing.

Story continues

To add to this point, Nvidia's trailing-12-month price-to-sales (P/S) ratio is strikingly similar to the P/S ratio peaks we witnessed from Cisco Systems and Amazon prior to the dot-com bubble bursting. History may not precisely repeat on Wall Street, but it does have a tendency to rhyme.

We're also starting to see evidence that competition will weigh on Nvidia's monopoly like market share in AI-accelerated data centers. Even if the company's GPUs were to maintain their compute advantages, new competitors can benefit from demand overwhelming supply — and Nvidia can't meet all of its enterprise demand.

Furthermore, Nvidia's four-largest customers by net sales are internally developing their own AI-GPUs. Even if these chips are used as a complement to Nvidia's H100 GPU, it signals the intent by America's most-influential businesses to reduce their reliance on Nvidia's hardware.

Stock-split stock No. 2 to keep your distance from in the latter half of 2024: Chipotle Mexican Grill

The second stock-split stock that investors would be wise to avoid in the second half of 2024 is none other than the hottest fast-casual restaurant chain on Wall Street, Chipotle Mexican Grill (NYSE: CMG). Chipotle's board announced the company's first-ever stock split (a 50-for-1 forward split) on March 19, with its share adjustment occurring after the closing bell on June 25.

Similar to Nvidia, I can recognize that Chipotle and its management team have done a lot right, even if I'm not currently a fan from an investment standpoint. Chipotle shares have rallied more than 14,800% since its initial public offering price of $22 in January 2006 due to a combination of simplicity and innovation.

Chipotle has kept things simple by sourcing its vegetables locally (when possible), using responsibly raised meats, prepping its food daily, and avoiding a bulky menu. The result is a well-oiled machine that quickly prepares meals and keeps lines in its stores moving.

But there's only so much innovation that can be squeezed out of a fast-casual restaurant chain. While the introduction of mobile order-dedicated drive-thru lanes (""Chipotlanes"") has helped the company immensely, Chipotle's same-store sales grew by only 7% during the first quarter. Though 7% same-store sales growth would be phenomenal for most businesses, it's a genuine eyesore for a company valued at roughly 50 times forward-year earnings.

I'll also add that 1.6% of the 7% organic growth rate in existing stores came from an ""increase in average check."" While it's always good news when a company enjoys strong pricing power, nearly a quarter of Chipotle's organic sales growth is simply due to inflation.

Considering that there are still predictive indicators that suggest a U.S. economic downturn is on the horizon — e.g., the historic decline in U.S. M2 money supply — companies with premium valuations in traditionally slower-growing industries, like Chipotle, are the likeliest to get thumped if a recession does materialize.

The stock-split stock you can confidently buy for the second half of 2024: Sirius XM Holdings

Out of the nine high-profile companies to have announced a stock split in 2024, eight are conducting forward splits. However, the best value of the group is the only top-tier company slated to complete a reverse-stock split: satellite-radio provider Sirius XM Holdings (NASDAQ: SIRI).

In a June 17 filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission, Sirius XM announced its intent to conduct a 1-for-10 reverse split upon completing its merger with Liberty Media's Sirius XM tracking stock, Liberty Sirius XM Group. This combination and share consolidation, which'll create a single outstanding share base, is expected to close during the third quarter.

Although reverse-stock splits are usually undertaken by companies on the decline, Sirius XM's operating performance has pointed to steady growth over the long haul.

One of the keys to Sirius XM's success is its revenue diversity. Terrestrial and online radio providers generate most of their sales from advertising. The thing about advertising is that it's highly cyclical and prone to fluctuations. Sirius XM brought in less than 19% of its first-quarter sales from ads (via Pandora).

By comparison, Sirius XM generated close to 78% of its sales in the March-ended quarter from subscriptions. Subscribers to its satellite-radio services are far less likely to cancel than businesses are to reduce their ad spending during periods of economic turbulence. Couple this with the fact that Sirius XM is the only licensed satellite-radio operator — ergo, it has exceptionally strong pricing power — and you have a recipe for steady operating cash flow in virtually any economic climate.

Additionally, Sirius XM enjoys better cost transparency than most radio operators. Whereas content and royalty costs are going to ebb-and-flow from quarter to quarter, transmission and equipment expenses aren't going to change much, if at all, regardless of how many subscribers the company adds.

At no point in Sirius XM's 30 years as a publicly traded company has it been cheaper than it is now. Shares can be scooped up by opportunistic investors for just 8 times forward-year earnings, which represents a 55% discount to its average forward-year earnings multiple over the last five years.

Yahoo Finance,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/avoid-social-security-tax-torpedo-160018318.html,2024-06-30,16:00:05 UTC,How to Avoid the Social Security 'Tax Torpedo',"A senior couple dealing with unexpected Social Security taxes, commonly referred to as the Social Security tax torpedo.

While retirees may be chagrined to discover that taxes don’t end when they leave the workforce, an unseen threat looms behind the U.S. tax code. The Social Security tax torpedo is as destructive as it sounds, blowing up the budgets of unsuspecting retired folks eagerly awaiting their first Social Security check. Having a clear understanding of your Social Security taxes could help you dodge this torpedo in retirement. Here’s what you need to know.

A financial advisor can help you create a financial plan to minimize your taxes in your golden years.

What Is Social Security Tax Torpedo?

The Social Security tax torpedo is a spike in taxes retirees can experience after receiving Social Security income. Specifically, 50% to 85% of your Social Security check may be taxable, depending on your income level and life circumstances. In addition, your Social Security income can increase your marginal tax rate, meaning the top portion of your income enters the next tax bracket. As a result, unsuspecting retirees can pay heavier taxes than anticipated, and their Social Security benefits provide less of a financial boost than expected.

Tax Torpedo Implications

The government bases your taxes in retirement on your modified adjusted gross income plus any nontaxable interest (usually from municipal bonds) and half of your Social Security benefits. The resulting sum is called your ‘combined income,’ which incurs different taxes depending on the amount and the filer’s status.

For instance, single filers with a combined income of $25,000 to $34,000 pay taxes on 50% of their benefits. An income above this amount results in taxes on 85% of the benefits. Likewise, those married filing jointly with combined incomes between $32,000 and $44,000 will pay taxes on 50% of their benefits. Any amount above this incurs taxes on 85% of the benefits.

Remember, the tax torpedo doesn’t mean you will lose 85% of your Social Security income taxes. Instead, you’ll owe your regular income tax rate on 85 cents of every dollar you receive from Social Security. In addition, your income tax rate isn’t the same across all your income because of how tax brackets work. The US tax code incurs progressive taxes on your income the higher it is.

For example, say you’re a single filer in 2023 with a total taxable income of $50,000 (putting you in the 22% tax rate for the income above $44,725). Your combined income is $35,000, and you receive $15,000 in Social Security benefits. You’re over the $34,000 combined income limit, meaning you’ll pay taxes on 85% of your Social Security benefits.

Story continues

This situation means applying your top marginal tax rate (22%) to 85% of your Social Security benefit ($12,750). So, your tax burden from Social Security is a $2,805 expense. If your combined income was $34,000 or less, only half your Social Security would be taxed, a $1,650 expense.

A financial advisor can help you navigate Social Security and the applicable taxes in your situation. Get matched with a financial advisor today.

How to Avoid the Social Security Tax Torpedo

A senior calculating his taxes to avoid the Social Security tax torpedo.

Losing your hard-earned Social Security benefits to Uncle Sam isn’t a foregone conclusion. Here’s how to sidestep the Social Security tax torpedo while maximizing your financial wellness and quality of life:

Use a Roth IRA

Roth IRAs are retirement accounts where contributions are made with after-tax dollars, meaning you don’t get a tax deduction when you contribute. However, the distributions during retirement are tax-free. As a result, your Roth IRA income doesn’t count towards your taxable income, reducing the likelihood that you’ll pass the threshold that determines whether 50% or 85% of your Social Security benefit is taxed.

Live in a Tax-Friendly State

Thirteen states tax your Social Security check, adding to the federal tax burden. As a result, you can save on taxes by avoiding residency in the following states:

Colorado

Connecticut

Kansas

Minnesota

Missouri

Montana

Nebraska

New Mexico

North Dakota

Rhode Island

Utah

Vermont

Washington

Give Your IRA Income to Charity

Qualified charitable distributions (QCDs) allow you to donate money directly from your traditional IRA to charity. The government doesn’t count the first $100,000 of donations as taxable income. While doing so won’t directly affect your Social Security tax, it will lower your overall taxable income, potentially reducing the portion of your Social Security benefits subject to taxation. Remember, this advantage is solely for traditional IRAs.

Buy a Qualified Longevity Annuity Contract (QLAC)

A QLAC is a specialized annuity that provides a guaranteed income stream later in life. You can transfer $130,000 from a traditional IRA or 401(k) to a newly opened QLAC, reducing the required minimum distributions (RMDs) you’ll take from your retirement account. This way, the distributions from your 401(k) or IRA won’t increase your annual income as much, mitigating Social Security taxes.

Your QLAC has a delayed RMD age compared to traditional retirement accounts. While the government requires RMDs from a 401(k) or IRA at age 73, you can delay distributions from your QLAC until you’re 85. Remember, you will owe taxes from QLAC distributions the year you receive them.

Compare Your Income Level to Tax Brackets

Understanding the income thresholds for different tax brackets can help you plan withdrawals from retirement accounts. By staying within lower tax brackets, you may reduce the portion of your Social Security benefits subject to taxation.

Delay Social Security

Taxes on Social Security income can’t apply until you receive your benefits. Therefore, delaying Social Security can help you avoid additional taxation through your 60s. If you can work or survive on other income until age 70, you’ll reap two benefits: first, you’ll maximize your Social Security payment amount. Second, you’ll avoid paying taxes on Social Security. Plus, if you live on a traditional IRA or 401(k) during that time, you’ll reduce your RMDs, giving you more control over your income level in your 70s.

Consider speaking with a financial advisor if you're interested in building a tax-efficient retirement plan.

Bottom Line

A senior surprised by unexpected taxes commonly known as the Social Security tax torpedo.

Understanding and proactively addressing the possibility of a Social Security tax torpedo can increase your net income during retirement. By utilizing tools like Roth IRAs, charitable donations, and QLACs, you can create a more tax-efficient retirement.

Additionally, being mindful of how your income level relates to tax brackets and considering delaying Social Security can provide further avenues to optimize your financial well-being and quality of life in retirement. Consulting a financial advisor can be instrumental in tailoring these strategies to your specific circumstances, helping you maximize your hard-earned retirement benefits.

Tips for Avoiding the Social Security Tax Torpedo

Consulting a financial advisor is a crucial step in planning for retirement and avoiding the Social Security tax torpedo as you can get personalized guidance tailored to your specific financial situation, goals, and preferences. Finding a financial advisor doesn’t have to be hard. SmartAsset’s free tool matches you with up to three vetted financial advisors who serve your area, and you can have a free introductory call with your advisor matches to decide which one you feel is right for you. If you’re ready to find an advisor who can help you achieve your financial goals, get started now.

Planning during your working years makes a tax-efficient retirement more doable. However, if you’re already retired, you can still lower your taxes and set yourself up for a brighter financial future.

Keep an emergency fund on hand in case you run into unexpected expenses. An emergency fund should be liquid — in an account that isn't at risk of significant fluctuation like the stock market. The tradeoff is that the value of liquid cash can be eroded by inflation. But a high-interest account allows you to earn compound interest. Compare savings accounts from these banks.

Yahoo Finance,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/could-buy-only-3-stocks-093200974.html,2024-06-30,09:32:00 UTC,"If I Could Buy Only 3 Stocks in 2024, I Would Pick These","Investors can own as many stocks as they want whenever they want, and thankfully so. After all, more stocks mean more diversification. In this vein, The Motley Fool suggests holding at least 25 different stocks at any given time.

Sometimes, though, it's eye-opening to think about which stocks you would buy if you could only buy a small number of them. Such an exercise forces you to identify the market's most promising risk-versus-reward scenarios.

With that as the backdrop, here's a rundown of the three names I would buy this year if I only had room and money to add another three tickers to my portfolio. (These picks, of course, only make sense for you if they improve your portfolio's diversification rather than making it less balanced.)

1. MercadoLibre

MercadoLibre (NASDAQ: MELI) is often referred to as the Amazon of Latin America. It's not an unfair comparison, but it is an incomplete one.

MercadoLibre is also akin to eBay, Shopify, and PayPal. Its wide lineup of tools has helped the company become South America's premier name in brick-and-mortar and e-commerce technology. The company facilitated nearly $41 billion in payments in the first quarter of this year while also serving as the middleman for $11.4 billion worth of sales of goods and services. Its subsequent revenue of $4.3 billion during the quarter was up 36% year over year, driving a 71% improvement in net income.

And this is still just the beginning. In many ways, South America is now where North America was roughly 20 years ago, when high-speed internet was still relatively new and smartphones were still only an idea. In the same way that Amazon was in the right place at the right time with the right business model, MercadoLibre is positioned to capitalize on the region's brewing mobile-technology boom.

And it is booming. Market researcher GSMA says 75 million people in South America became mobile internet users just within the past five years, while Canalys reports the region's smartphone shipments surged 26% year over year in the first quarter following the fourth quarter's growth of 20%.

Even so, only 65% of the continent's population currently uses a wireless broadband-capable smartphone. The rest are coming around, though. GSMA believes South America's mobile internet penetration rate will grow to 72% by 2030, with most of those connections likely to be ultra-high-speed 5G by that point.

Because e-commerce grows in step with consumers' growing ability to be online, Americas Market Intelligence is looking for Latin America's e-commerce market to grow 24% this year, then by another 21% next year, and then match that pace again in 2026.

Story continues

MercadoLibre is arguably better positioned than any other name to capitalize on this growth.

2. Alphabet

Few investors would deny that Google parent Alphabet (NASDAQ: GOOG) (NASDAQ: GOOGL) is still a force to be reckoned with. But plenty of people also seem to presume its highest-growth glory days are in the past. The search engine industry is fully matured, after all, and crowded with credible competition like Microsoft's artificial intelligence powered Bing.

If you don't think Alphabet has any growth engines left to rev, however, think again. Its cloud computing venture is an example. While still only a fraction of the size of Amazon's and Microsoft's cloud businesses, this segment still produced revenue growth of 28% during the first quarter of the year.

Better yet, Google Cloud is now consistently and meaningfully profitable, generating $900 million worth of operating profits in the three-month stretch ending in March. Mordor Intelligence expects the worldwide cloud computing market will grow at an annualized pace of more than 16% through 2029, so Alphabet's cloud segment holds tremendous profit promise.

Ratings agency Nielsen says the company's YouTube service is more watched within the United States than conventional streaming services like Netflix or Walt Disney's Hulu and Disney+. YouTube's top line improved 21% year over year in first quarter, as Alphabet continues to figure out how to make it a destination platform within the highly fragmented and often-unprofitable streaming space.

Google Search's advertising business might not be as stagnant as some suspect, too. Its ad revenue grew more than 14% during the first quarter of the year, helped by the search engine's sustained reach. GlobalStats says Google still handles about 90% of the world's web searches, as it has for well over a decade.

So Alphabet looks as strong as it's ever been. The fact that shares are rallying despite plenty of well-voiced worries should tell you everything you need to know about what investors see for its foreseeable future.

3. Bank of America

I would round out my limited number of stock picks for 2024 with a new position in Bank of America (NYSE: BAC).

It's not an easy name to get exciting about owning right now. The stock has underperformed since early 2022, dragged down by the economic malaise caused by sky-high inflation. Although high interest rates generally widen banks' profit margins, the subsequent trade-offs of that dynamic are diminished demand for loans as well as a greater number of loan defaults and delinquencies.

BofA's provision for loan losses grew to $1.3 billion in the first quarter, while net interest income slipped 3% to $14 billion, dragging per-share profits down from $0.94 in the first quarter of last year to $0.83 this time around. Other business lines like corporate banking and investment management are also running into headwinds.

Largely lost in all the noise, however, is that nothing about the banking industry's current challenges is new. This is a highly (and predictably) cyclical business tethered to an equally predictably cyclical economy.

We do not know exactly when inflation will finally abate or when the global economy will perk up again. We do know, however, we want to be positioned in BofA before it becomes clear that this recovery is happening. Like most stocks, this one tends to move predictively rather than reactively.

In the meantime, you're plugging into a ticker that's paying a healthy, reliable dividend. Although you can certainly find stocks with a bigger dividend yield than Bank of America's current forward-looking yield of a little more than 2.4%, this big bank is protecting its business and balance sheet in a way that ensures it will be able to continue funding its dividend payout as well as raise it.

Its annualized dividend payment of $0.96 per share is less than one-third of this year's expected per-share earnings of $3.25, and even relatively less than next year's estimate of $3.59. That's a nice cushion for anyone seeking dependable investment income.

Don’t miss this second chance at a potentially lucrative opportunity

Ever feel like you missed the boat in buying the most successful stocks? Then you’ll want to hear this.

On rare occasions, our expert team of analysts issues a “Double Down” stock recommendation for companies that they think are about to pop. If you’re worried you’ve already missed your chance to invest, now is the best time to buy before it’s too late. And the numbers speak for themselves:

Amazon: if you invested $1,000 when we doubled down in 2010, you’d have $21,765 !*

Apple: if you invested $1,000 when we doubled down in 2008, you’d have $39,798 !*

Netflix: if you invested $1,000 when we doubled down in 2004, you’d have $363,957!*

Right now, we’re issuing “Double Down” alerts for three incredible companies, and there may not be another chance like this anytime soon.

Yahoo Finance,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/cathie-wood-bought-stock-every-111500772.html,2024-07-01,11:15:00 UTC,Cathie Wood Bought This Stock Every Day Last Month: Should You?,"One thing you can say about Cathie Wood is that she's persistent. The aggressive growth investor who's also the co-founder, CEO, and ace stock picker at Ark Invest enjoys swinging the fences. She's also not afraid to go for the safe single, binge-buying some of her favorite holdings over and over again.

She publishes Ark Invest's transactions at the end of every market day. Something out of the ordinary happened on Friday night, as she announced her purchases from earlier in the day. PagerDuty (NYSE: PD) was one of the six existing positions that she added to on Friday. More importantly, she bought shares of the cloud-based provider of enterprise analytics and uptime monitoring solutions every single trading day in June. She obviously likes PagerDuty right now. Should you? Let's take a closer look.

Reporting for duty

Enterprise software companies are all about making businesses more efficient, and that's what PagerDuty's growing suite of offerings aims to accomplish. From automation tools that help increase task completion speeds and lower support costs to its incident management platform that allows clients to navigate through hiccups and come out of disruptions even smarter, PagerDuty's ambitious isn't on trial.

Growth has been the problem, particularly given its recent run of slowing top-line gains. Year-over-year revenue growth has decelerated for seven consecutive financial reports, from a starting point of 34% down to just 8% nearly two years later.

Q2 2023: 34%

Q3 2023: 31%

Q4 2023: 29%

Q1 2024: 21%

Q2 2024: 19%

Q3 2024: 15%

Q4 2024: 10%

Q1 2025: 8%

PagerDuty's dollar-based net retention rate has disintegrated from 116% to 106% over the past year, and its paid customers count has stalled around 15,100 in that time. The bottom line has also been problematic. It has never turned a profit on a reported basis, and analysts don't see that changing anytime soon. It did announce a small round of layoffs earlier this year, but it remains to be seen if the cost controls will pay off without sacrificing a potential return to top-line growth.

Knocking on Wood

Cathie Wood naturally has a more upbeat read on PagerDuty than the downward sloping fundamentals. She has been buying a piece of PagerDuty every trading day since May 31. Despite the recent daily trickle of purchases, it remains one of the smallest positions across the combined holdings of Ark Invest's exchange-traded funds.

She's not the only one who was buying. Shares of PagerDuty soared 21% last month.

There are some reasons to be upbeat about PagerDuty's near-term prospects. For starters, despite the single-digit revenue growth that PagerDuty posted in its latest quarter, Wall Street pros see it returning to double-digit revenue gains for the entire fiscal year and accelerating in each of the next two years.

Story continues

Profitability on an adjusted basis is also expected to climb 14% next year and another 24% in fiscal 2027. This prices PagerDuty stock at 23 times that fiscal year's adjusted earnings, but it has also posted double-digit percentage beats in each of the past four reports.

The naysayers are still plentiful, and that's not necessarily a bad thing. Nearly 12% of PagerDuty's shares are currently being sold short, approaching the all-time high it notched earlier this year. In the right environment, even a modest bullish catalyst can send the boo-birds scrambling for cover, and the short squeeze would theoretically push the stock higher.

Sentiment could be turning after a buoyant June. Chad Bennett at Craig-Hallum upgraded the stock last week, rallying around the potential for revenue gains to accelerate after bottoming out in the fiscal first quarter. His new $30 price target implies another 31% of upside in the shares. A reignited PagerDuty should result in either the resumption of customer growth or a reversal in the retreat of its dollar-based net retention rate. In an ideal world it would be a little bit of both leading the charge, and PagerDuty reaching reported profitability sooner than expected. For now, a once out-of-favor software-as-a-service company -- or SaaS stock -- is starting to court believers. Wood seems to have the right idea when it comes to buying PagerDuty this summer.

Should you invest $1,000 in PagerDuty right now?

Most Read from Bloomberg

The disclosure with the US Securities and Exchange Commission shows Gill owns roughly 9 million Class A shares, worth about $245 million based on Friday’s closing price. Shares of Chewy and Petco Health and Wellness Co. briefly soared last week after Gill posted a cartoon image of a dog on X.

A representative for Chewy didn’t immediately respond to a Bloomberg News request for comment outside of regular business hours.

Gill, who shot to fame in 2021 as he rallied retail traders around GameStop Corp., returned to social media earlier this year, setting off a volatile period for GameStop and other so-called meme stocks.

Both the video game retailer and the pet foods company have one thing in common — Ryan Cohen — who co-founded Chewy and is GameStop’s current chief executive officer. Shares of GameStop fell as much as 5.7% in premarket trading on Monday after Gill’s disclosure was released.

Monday’s filing lists June 24 as the date of event and contained a tongue-in-cheek reference to Gill’s Roaring Kitty persona. The document submitted to the SEC’s Edgar database of corporate filings includes a section for the reporting person to “designate whether you are a cat.” It’s followed by two check boxes, one that reads “I am a cat.” and the other — which is marked — reads “I am not a cat.”

Yahoo Finance,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/morgan-stanley-team-trump-trade-040858758.html,2024-07-01,07:17:29 UTC,Trump Ascendancy Has Morgan Stanley Team Touting Steeper Curve,"(Bloomberg) -- The growing prospect of a Trump presidential victory is making yield curve steepeners an attractive bet as growth will likely slow and inflation quicken under such a scenario, according to Morgan Stanley.

Most Read from Bloomberg

The US presidential debate has strengthened the possibility of Donald Trump’s re-election, and this will sharpen the focus on the former president’s immigration and tariff policies, the bank’s strategists wrote in a June 29 note. Bond traders are bracing for a similar outcome, with the yield discount of 10-year notes over two-year securities shrinking the most since January last week.

“There has been a clear relative shift in the probabilities of President Trump winning over President Biden” since the debate, Morgan Stanley strategists including Matthew Hornbach and Guneet Dhingra wrote in the note. “The sharp shift of probabilities in favor of President Trump may be a unique catalyst that makes curve steepeners attractive.”

The recalibration in bets may complicate the outlook for the US government bond market after it capped a two-month winning streak last week. Traders are pricing in the risk of slower growth and faster inflation as Trump has vowed to deport undocumented immigrants and ramped up threats of increased tariffs against China.

“The market now has to contend with rising probabilities of changes in immigration and tariff policies in an economy where growth has already been cooling, making the market more likely” to price in more US interest-rate cuts, the strategists wrote. “Higher prospects of a Republican sweep, amid growing focus on deficits, could put upward pressure on long-end term premiums.”

The strategists recommended adding two-year/20-year steepeners in Treasuries.

Higher tariffs and the possible deportation of migrants would both be negative for US economic growth, Morgan Stanley analysts said in a presentation last month. The hit to the economy would likely encourage the Federal Reserve to cut interest rates, reducing short-term yields.

The Congressional Budget Office has estimated that immigration will generate a $7 trillion boost to gross domestic product over the next decade.

US Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen said last month that Trump’s proposed tariffs would raise costs for consumers and weigh on American businesses. Faster inflation would be bad news for longer-maturity debt as it diminishes the value of their fixed payments over time.

The outcome of the presidential debate has triggered a flurry of calls from analysts on how to position for a Trump victory. For its part, Barclays Plc is recommending that investors buy inflation hedges in the US Treasury market.

Nomura Securities Co.’s Naokazu Koshimizu sees a Trump administration favoring fiscal expansion and a weak dollar. This, along with the preference for a dovish Federal Reserve chair, would lead to a steeper US yield curve.

“It would be difficult to cover the fiscal expansion in the event of a Trump administration with additional tariffs alone, and the possibility of issuing more bonds will increase,” the Nomura senior rates strategist wrote in a note Monday. “If inflation flares up again and the Fed policy rate remains high, an increase in interest payments is also expected to lead to a wider fiscal deficit.”

(Updates with Morgan Stanley economist’ views in seventh paragraph, CBO’s estimates in eighth paragraph and background in ninth paragraph. An earlier version of this story was corrected to show US yield curve became less inverted, yield discount of 10-year notes over two-year securities shrank the most since January and trade recommendation)

©2024 Bloomberg L.P.","(Bloomberg) -- The growing prospect of a Trump presidential victory is making yield curve steepeners an attractive bet as growth will likely slow and inflation quicken under such a scenario, according to Morgan Stanley.
Most Read from BloombergThe US presidential debate has strengthened the possibility of Donald Trump’s re-election, and this will sharpen the focus on the former president’s immigration and tariff policies, the bank’s strategists wrote in a June 29 note.
“There has been a clear relative shift in the probabilities of President Trump winning over President Biden” since the debate, Morgan Stanley strategists including Matthew Hornbach and Guneet Dhingra wrote in the note.
Higher tariffs and the possible deportation of migrants would both be negative for US economic growth, Morgan Stanley analysts said in a presentation last month.

Equity investors enjoyed the first half of 2024, as the S&P 500 logged a double-digit gain. Historically, that type of performance has been a precursor to further increases in stocks by the end of the year. Our study of seasonal stock market returns identified 16 first-half periods since 1980 during which the S&P 500 rose at least 10% (in fact, the average gain was 15.8%). The average S&P 500 return in the second half of those years was 7.3%. How do these compare against the overall averages? Well, for all years, first-half gains averaged 5.2% and second-half gains averaged 4.9%. So not bad. Going back to our double-digit first half years, the best performance came in 1986, when the market roared out of the starting gate and soared 25.5%. The best second half from that group was in 2012, when the S&P 500 tacked on another 17%. Still, there are no guarantees that stocks will continue to climb in the second half.

Here are two outstanding dividend stocks with long histories of rewarding their shareholders with steadily rising cash payments. Both stocks can help you build your own streams of passive income.

Top dividend stock No. 1: Lockheed Martin

Lockheed Martin (NYSE: LMT) helps the U.S. government and its allies protect their citizens from a growing number of threats. The company is a vital ally in an increasingly volatile world.

As a leading defense contractor, Lockheed supplies crucial technology to the U.S. military. Here are just a few examples:

The F-35 stealth aircraft serves a crucial role in the security strategies of the Air Force, Navy, and Marines, as well as that of 18 allied nations.

The Aegis radar system is helping U.S. forces protect merchant shipping vessels from drone and missile attacks in the Red Sea.

Patriot-launched PAC-3 interceptors are enabling Ukraine to fend off Russia's aerial bombardments.

Lockheed has amassed $159 billion worth of orders for its broad array of defensive platforms. Combined with the long service lives of its key products -- the F-35, for one, is expected to remain in service until at least 2080 -- this massive backlog gives investors a high degree of visibility into the company's future cash flow.

Management is committed to passing much of this cash on to shareholders via stock buybacks and a steadily rising dividend. Over the past decade, Lockheed has bought back a quarter of its shares, which has boosted per-share profits for its remaining stockholders. The defense leader has also raised its cash payout for 21 straight years. Today, Lockheed's dividend yield is a solid 2.7%.

Top dividend stock No. 2: Eli Lilly

For more than 140 years, Eli Lilly (NYSE: LLY) has used cutting-edge science to help people live better. The healthcare leader's history is chock-full of medical breakthroughs, but its latest discovery could be the most impactful and profitable one yet.

Almost 70% of American adults are obese or overweight, which can lead to life-threatening illnesses like diabetes, heart disease, and strokes. Fortunately, Eli Lilly has developed a game-changing drug that makes it easier for people to lose weight.

Zepbound, the pharmaceutical pioneer's weight-management treatment for adults, activates hormone receptors that reduce appetite. Participants in a 72-week clinical trial who received the highest dose of the drug lost 48 pounds on average.

Story continues

When combined with diet and exercise, Zepbound also helped these people improve their cholesterol and blood pressure profiles. And tirzepatide, the active ingredient in Zepbound, can make it easier for adults with type 2 diabetes to control their blood sugar levels. Better still, recent studies suggest that tirzepatide could have positive effects for people with liver disease and sleep apnea.

Due to tirzepatide's many potential health benefits, CEO Dave Ricks believes it will be the most important medicine of his 28-year career. Wall Street seems to agree. Investment bank Goldman Sachs expects Eli Lilly to be a leader in an anti-obesity drug market that will soar to $130 billion by the end of the decade. The company's profits, in turn, are projected to increase by more than 60% annually over the next five years.

Yahoo Finance,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/nvidia-stock-cross-1-000-120955752.html,2024-07-01,12:09:55 UTC,"Can Nvidia Stock Cross $1,000 Again After the Stock Split?","Nvidia's (NASDAQ: NVDA) stock popped up by a dramatic 500% in the past three years. Undoubtedly, much of this recent rally has been fueled by the company's position as a key beneficiary and enabler of the ongoing artificial intelligence (AI) wave.

Nvidia offers a full-stack AI platform, comprising cutting-edge AI-optimized hardware chips, a complete software ecosystem, high-speed networking solutions, and servers to enable clients to build ""AI factories,"" or the essential infrastructure for AI-based outputs (text, images, audio, video). The company's accelerated product release cadence, from two years to one year, also helps it maintain technological superiority against competition.

Furthermore, besides the booming demand from large hyperscale companies, enterprises, and AI start-ups, Nvidia's AI-optimized hardware and software solutions are now increasingly used in new areas such as Sovereign AI (governments building domestic AI capabilities), automotive vertical, and robotics business.

The AI frenzy propelled Nvidia's stock to an all-time high of over $1,200 in early June. Its recently executed 10-for-1 stock split made its stock far more accessible to retail investors.

With Nvidia's stock now around $124 at this writing, long-term investors may be keen to know if the stock can again jump to $1,000-plus levels. Let's analyze the company's fundamentals and valuations to find some answers.

Intensifying competition and supply challenges

Nvidia's technological superiority in developing AI-optimized hardware and software enabled the company to capture a whopping 90% share of the global AI chip market. However, the company's stronghold may get challenged in the long run. Although currently far behind Nvidia, competitors Advanced Micro Devices and Intel are working hard to capture a slice of the AI market.

AMD's MI300 family of data center chips witnessed strong demand, while the company is also gearing up for launching families of AI chips such as MI325 and MI350 accelerators, based on advanced architectures, in the coming months. AMD expects these chips to demonstrate faster performance, improved memory capacity, and stronger computing capabilities for AI workloads.

Intel is also aggressively focusing on the AI PC opportunity and hopes to launch Lunar Lake laptop CPUs by September 2024. Lunar Lake chips are expected to be superior in performance, efficiency, and graphics processing compared to their predecessor Meteor Lake chips. Plus, Intel has also introduced Gaudi 3 AI accelerators, offering superior cost-performance benefits for training and inferencing of AI models.

Story continues

Nvidia also faces the risk of customers such as cloud players and technology giants becoming competitors, as they have been accelerating in-house development of AI-optimized chips and solutions. This risk cannot be ignored, since large cloud players account for roughly 45% of the company's data center revenues.

Multiple other challenges

While demand for Nvidia's AI chips and solutions has grown dramatically, the company continues to face supply constraints associated with procuring manufacturing, testing, and packaging capacity from Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing and other vendors. Subsequently, the company expects demand for its new H200 chips and next-generation Blackwell chips to outpace supply well until 2025. This headwind can affect the company's growth prospects in the coming years.

Nvidia also accelerated the pace of release cadence (for major products or features) from once every two years to once annually. Continuously innovating and adapting hardware and software is the need of the hour in the face of increasing complexity and rapid evolution of AI models and workloads.

However, this also exposes Nvidia to significant execution risks and to the risk of clients delaying purchases to get access to the most advanced technologies. Nvidia's rapid pace of innovation can result in early product obsolescence for its older offerings and increasing risk of self-cannibalization.

Valuation estimates

Nvidia has consistently posting impressive financial metrics for the past several quarters. In the first quarter of fiscal 2025 (ending April 28), revenues were up by nearly 262% year over year to $26 billion, while net income soared by 628% year over year to $14.9 billion.

Analysts expect Nvidia's fiscal 2025 sales to grow by 97% year over year to $120 billion. While the revenue growth rate is expected to moderate in the next decade, analysts expect the company's sales to more than triple to $380.9 billion by 2034.

Nvidia is currently trading at a price-to-sales (P/S) multiple of 38.6x. Assuming that this multiple reverts to its 10-year average of 22.27x (a conservative estimate), we can expect Nvidia's market capitalization to reach around $8.5 trillion by 2034. While the market cap seems huge, it is only 2.7 times the company's current $3.1 trillion market capitalization. This implies that the stock can reach north of $340 by 2034 (assuming no significant share repurchases or stock splits).

Assuming Nvidia's P/S multiple remains at the current 38.6x level (a very aggressive estimate), the company's market capitalization will be around $14.7 trillion -- 4.7 times its current market capitalization. Still, the company's share price can be expected to reach close to $600 by the end of 2034.

Hence, based on current estimates, the chances of Nvidia's share price crossing $1,000 in the next decade appear slim. These projections, however, can change in case Nvidia makes even more dramatic advances in AI technologies in the coming years.

This can been seen in the performance of major sector exchange-traded funds (ETFs) such as the Alerian Energy Infrastructure ETF (NYSEMKT: ENFR), up about 18% year to date, and the Alerian MLP ETF (NYSEMKT: AMLP), up nearly 17%. The latter only includes the stocks of midstream companies structured as master limited partnerships (MLPs), while the former includes midstream companies structured as both MLPs and corporations.

While the first half of the year has been a good one for the sector, there is strong reason to believe a number of stocks in the space could be set to outperform in the second half and beyond.

Lets look at three midstream stocks set to outperform the rest of this year and into the future.

Image source: Getty Images.

MPLX

MPLX (NYSE: MPLX) is a midstream company involved in logistics and storage as well as gathering and processing (G&P). Refiner Marathon Petroleum owns approximately 65% of the company and represents just under 50% of its revenue.

The stock sports an attractive 8% yield based on its most recent distribution and had a robust 1.6 times coverage ratio in the first quarter of 2024. Meanwhile, its balance sheet is in good shape with a leverage ratio (net debt/adjusted EBITDA) of just 3.2 times. The company has been a consistent performer, raising its base distribution each year since 2012.

The company is well positioned in both Appalachia (Marcellus and Utica) and the Permian, and has a robust pipeline of growth projects in both regions over the next few years. It is planning to spend $950 million in growth capital expenditure (capex) this year. The company also recently acquired some G&P assets in the Utica and entered into an agreement to merge the Whistler Pipeline and Rio Bravo Pipeline projects into a new joint venture in order to link Permian supply to additional Gulf Coast demand, which it believes will lead to future growth opportunities. <

Situated in the right basins, MPLX looks in good shape to continue growing its distributions, while its forward enterprise value (EV)-to-EBITDA (earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization) valuation of 9.6 times (one of the most common ways to value midstream stocks) is attractive and well below the 13.7 times multiple the sector traded at between 2011 to 2016.

Western Midstream

One of the best-performing midstream stocks in the first half of the year was Western Midstream (NYSE: WES), which was up around 35%. The company primarily services Occidental Petroleum's gathering and processing (G&P) needs in the Delaware Permian, Powder River Basin (PRB), and Denver-Julesburg (DJ) basins.

Story continues

The company started the year strong, recording record Q1 adjusted EBITDA of $609 million that was up 22%, while its free cash flow soared 60% to $225 million. This prompted Western to say it expected its adjusted EBITDA to come in at the high end of its previous guidance calling for full-year adjusted EBITDA of between $2.2 billion and $2.4 billion.

Impressively, the company increased its quarterly distribution by 52% from $0.575 per unit to $0.875. Based on this distribution, the stock now yields about 8.9%. Western appears on track to reach its leverage (net debt/adjusted EBITDA) goal of 3 times by year end, at which point it could pay out excess (special or variable) distributions above its current $0.875 quarterly based payout. That would likely help propel the stock even higher and set it up to continue to outperform.

Meanwhile, with a forward EV-to-EBITDA valuation of 9.6 times, the stock is trading at an attractive valuation that is well below historical levels.

Energy Transfer (ET)

One of the stocks best positioned to benefit from increasing power consumption stemming from artificial intelligence (AI), meanwhile, is Energy Transfer (NYSE: ET). The company has the largest integrated midstream system in the country with strong positions in low-cost natural gas-producing regions, particularly the Permian. As primarily a prolific oil-producing basin, the associated natural gas that comes from production in the Permian is some of the cheapest in the country, which is likely to draw many new data centers to the region given the immense energy that is needed to power AI.

Energy Transfer already has one of the most robust growth-project backlogs in the midstream space, with the company expecting to spend nearly $3 billion in growth capex this year. Projects related to AI energy consumption are only likely to increase that backlog in the future.

At the same time, the company has repaired its balance sheet to nicely lower its leverage, while carrying a high distribution-coverage ratio of over 2 times last quarter.

Trading at a forward EV/EBITDA ratio of just 7.4 times, Energy Transfer is a cheap stock with a lot of potential growth in front of it. That's why it is my favorite midstream stock to outperform in the second half of 2024 and beyond.

Yahoo Finance,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/1-incredible-growth-stock-down-122900631.html,2024-07-01,12:29:00 UTC,1 Incredible Growth Stock Down 81% You'll Regret Not Buying on the Dip,"The S&P 500 has set one new all-time high after another in 2024, but not every stock has participated in the current bull market. Some stocks remain beaten down, well below the highs reached in late 2021 and early 2022.

Some of the companies behind those stocks benefited from the behavior changes ushered in by the COVID-19 pandemic. But as things start to resemble the way things were pre-pandemic, they don't look as attractive. Others, however, look oversold, and their current valuations don't reflect their true potential.

One example of the latter is PayPal (NASDAQ: PYPL). PayPal's share price surged as COVID-19 drove more online and contactless sales. But a couple of bad quarters and a CEO change led to a massive sell-off in shares. The stock currently trades around 81% below the all-time high it reached in mid-2021. Here's why it may be a great opportunity to buy up some shares.

Image source: Getty Images.

It's already showing signs of a turnaround

One of the biggest things weighing on PayPal over the past year was its declining active account total. Active accounts peaked in the fourth quarter of 2022 and experienced four consecutive sequential declines during 2023.

But active accounts increased in the first quarter, climbing 2 million to reach 427 million total. While there's still a long way to go to get back to where it was at the end of 2022, the turnaround progress is encouraging.

The biggest driver of the active account decline was churn from inactive accounts in emerging markets in the Latin America and Asia Pacific regions. It's now growing by adding users who are spending more and more frequently. Total payment volume was up 14% year over year despite fewer users than this time last year. Transactions per active account over the past year reached an all-time high of 60.

The virtuous cycle driving strong engagement growth

The growing engagement of PayPal users signals its network advantage. On one side of the network are consumers and on the other side are merchants. The massive consumer base using PayPal draws more merchants to accept the digital wallet and the growing number of merchants taking PayPal draws more consumers to the platform. A growing number of merchants also gives existing users more opportunities to use PayPal.

There's good reason for merchants to choose PayPal, too. Not only does it add another payment option for around 400 million online shoppers, but it also makes them more likely to complete a transaction. The company reports a 33% increase in checkout conversions when the buyer uses PayPal versus another form of payment.

Story continues

While PayPal faces competition, none of its competitors has a user base the size of PayPal. That makes it practically indispensable for online merchants.

That said, fierce competition can and has weighed on PayPal's ability to charge higher fees for merchants. It also pushed the company to allow more consumer choice in its default payments, instead of forcing them to pay using methods more lucrative for the company (like cash balances).

Still, it's hard to deny PayPal's position as the leading digital wallet, putting it in a prime position for the continued secular growth in e-commerce.

The stock is an absolute bargain

The stock currently trades for a forward price-to-earnings ratio below 14x. That's incredibly low, even if you expect competition to eat into its revenue growth and margins.

Management's updated full-year 2024 guidance calls for mid- to high-single-digit earnings-per-share (EPS) growth. PayPal should be able to drive double-digit revenue growth as it returns to year-over-year active account growth this year. While non-branded checkout has weighed on its gross margin, it's cutting costs in other areas, which should result in stable to growing operating margins. That could mean PayPal exceeds its current full-year outlook.

What's more, PayPal is aggressively buying back shares at this price. It forecasts $5 billion in free cash flow, and management plans to repurchase even more than $5 billion in shares this year. That provides a further boost to earnings per share.

Wall Street analysts currently expect PayPal to grow its earnings per share at a compound annual rate of almost 16% over the next five years as a result of the above factors. So, with shares trading under 14x earnings, they present an incredible bargain for investors.

Yahoo Finance,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/spousal-social-security-benefits-3-095000736.html,2024-06-30,09:50:00 UTC,Spousal Social Security Benefits: 3 Things All Retired Couples Should Know,"Married couples share nearly everything -- food, homes, vacations, and more. In some cases, they can even share Social Security retirement benefits.

The Social Security program has included spousal benefits since its beginning in the 1930s. Here are three things all retired couples should know about spousal Social Security benefits.

Image source: Getty Images.

1. Eligibility requirements for spousal benefits

Can you receive Social Security retirement benefits based on your spouse's work record? Only if you meet specific eligibility requirements.

First, you usually must be married to your spouse for at least one year before you can receive Social Security spousal benefits. This doesn't apply, however, if you are the parent of your spouse's child. Ex-spouses may also be eligible for spousal benefits if they were married for at least 10 years.

Second, you'll need to be at least 62 years old to claim spousal benefits with a couple of exceptions. If you provide care for a child age 16 or younger, the age requirement is waived. That's also the case if you provide care for a child age 17 or older with a disability who is entitled to receive Social Security dependent benefits based on your spouse's record.

Third, your spousal benefit can't be higher than the amount you'd receive based on your own earnings history. If it isn't, the Social Security Administration (SSA) will pay you based on your own work record rather than your spouse's.

2. Potential spousal benefit amount

The maximum spousal benefit is 50% of the higher-earning spouse's primary insurance amount (PIA). The PIA is the amount of the higher-earning spouse's benefit at their full retirement age. For anyone born in 1960 or later, the full retirement age is 67.

Spouses won't receive this maximum benefit, though, if they begin collecting benefits before their own full retirement age. The Social Security early retirement penalty will be imposed with benefits reduced by five-ninths of 1% for each month up to 36 months before reaching full retirement age and five-twelfths of 1% for each month before then. However, if a spouse is providing care for a qualifying child, the spousal benefit won't be reduced.

Note that the spousal benefit isn't based on when the higher-earning spouse begins collecting retirement benefits. If this spouse retires early or holds off until age 70, it won't change the amount of the spousal benefit. However, it would impact the survivor's benefit if he or she dies.

3. Deemed filing

The Bipartisan Budget Act of 2015 made an important change often referred to as the ""deemed filing"" rule that affects Social Security spousal benefits. Deemed filing means when individuals file for spousal benefits, they also must file simultaneously for their own retirement benefits. In the past, people could file for spousal benefits before reaching their full retirement age but hold off on filing for their own retirement benefits until they reached full retirement age.

Story continues

However, the deemed filing rule doesn't apply if you receive spousal benefits because you're providing care for your retired spouse's qualifying child. It also doesn't apply to survivor benefits. If your spouse dies, you can begin receiving Social Security survivor benefits without filing for your retirement benefit.

The $ 22,924 Social Security bonus most retirees completely overlook

But a handful of little-known ""Social Security secrets"" could help ensure a boost in your retirement income. For example: one easy trick could pay you as much as $22,924 more... each year!

Yahoo Finance,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/generative-ai-software-sales-could-091000005.html,2024-06-30,09:10:00 UTC,"Generative AI Software Sales Could Soar 18,647% by 2032. 1 Unstoppable Artificial Intelligence (AI) Stock to Buy Before They Do (Hint: It's Not Nvidia)","Many experts believe the latest developments in artificial intelligence (AI) will profoundly impact the technology and business landscapes. These advanced systems can generate original content, streamline time-consuming processes, and automate procedures — all with a few simple commands. This, in turn, promises to increase productivity and save money, which has companies racing to adopt the next-generation algorithms.

One of the most obvious beneficiaries of this trend is Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA). The company's graphics processing units (GPUs) supply the computational horsepower required to process AI training and inference. However, the investing community is beginning to look beyond the first phase of AI adoption (hardware) to what comes next, which will invariably be AI-infused software. It's estimated that generative AI software sales could soar as much as 18,647% to $280 billion by 2032, according to Bloomberg Intelligence.

While there's little doubt that Nvidia will continue to prosper from its early adoption of AI, another company has decades of experience in the field and is poised to profit as the tidal wave of AI software adoption commences.

An AI pioneer

Palantir Technologies (NYSE: PLTR) established itself as one of the early leaders in the AI revolution more than two decades ago. The company partnered with U.S. government agencies and its allies to develop AI software tools to aid in the war on terror. Its AI-powered data mining systems connected the dots between seemingly unrelated bits of information to helped flush out terrorists. In recent years Palantir has focused its attention on the enterprise sector, providing companies with actionable information to make data-driven decisions.

With decades of experience in the field, Palantir was able to pivot quickly and develop state-of-the-art generative AI tools to help businesses succeed. The company's latest brainchild is its Artificial Intelligence Platform (AIP), which provides users with keen insight to solve everyday business dilemmas.

One Palantir demo video shows the impact of shuttering a production line in the face of an oncoming hurricane. AIP provides suggestions regarding which orders to accelerate, delay, or cancel, which orders can be rerouted to other distribution centers, and how those decisions will affect backlogs and the associated sales. It can also estimate the financial impact of hiring additional trucks to accelerate high-priority deliveries before the storm hits, assessing how this will affect profits.

Most businesses would jump at the opportunity to deploy tools with those capabilities, but the complexity alone would be enough to confound all but the most technologically savvy executives. Palantir addressed the issue by staging AIP boot camps. Developers and executives alike can attend these hands-on sessions, allowing them to build sophisticated applications alongside Palantir engineers and building real-world, company-specific solutions.

Story continues

This strategy has been wildly successful, helping Palantir increase its U.S. commercial customer count by 69% year over year and 19% sequentially in the first quarter. This was largely thanks to AIP bootcamps and the resulting accelerated deal volume.

This helps illustrate the vast potential of Palantir's boot camp strategy.

The proof is in the pudding

The results have only just begun to impact the company's financial results. In the first quarter, revenue of $634 million grew 21% year over year and 4% quarter over year, resulting in Palantir's sixth consecutive quarter of profitability. U.S. commercial revenue, which includes AIP, grew 40% year over year while customers for the segment grew 69%. Remaining deal revenue (RDV), or the remaining value of contracts not yet recorded as revenue, grew 74%.

Management expects the company's growth streak to continue. Palantir increased its full-year outlook and is now expecting revenue of $2.68 billion, representing growth of 20% at the midpoint of its guidance. Perhaps more telling, however, is the expected strong showing from U.S. commercial revenue, which is expected to clock in at least $661 million, an increase of 45%. That's up compared to its guidance of 40% growth issued just last quarter. This suggests there's continuing strong demand for AIP boot camps.

Every rose has its thorns

The company's rapid growth and ties to AI aside, some investors will be put off by Palantir's valuation, which is understandable — but looks can be deceiving. The stock currently trades for 211 times earnings and 25 times sales, which is enough to make any value investors run for cover. However, rapid growth tends to skew the most commonly used valuation metrics. However, a more useful measure in this case is the forward price/earnings-to-growth (PEG) ratio, which clocks in at 0.79, when anything less than 1 indicates an undervalued stock.

Generative AI is still in the early stages of adoption, and the resulting rollout could take years to accomplish. Palantir is poised to be an early winner in the next phase of the AI revolution thanks to its decades of expertise and brilliant go-to-market strategy.

That's why Palantir stock is a buy.

Sure, some college professor who gave an inspiring leadership speech at a TED Talk 10 years ago and is now appearing in one-minute clips on your Instagram feed might suggest it's OK to have bad days at work, even if you are a winner.

Trust me, it's not — and don't let that social clip allow you to think otherwise.

This same philosophy could be applied to the stock market's most important stock: Nvidia (NVDA).

I know you like that transition, Morning Brief readers! Hear me out on this top performer in the market.

Over the past week, we were reminded of how inflated expectations are for Nvidia and how the stock has entered dangerous waters that many traders who arrived late to the Nvidia game have never navigated before.

On June 18, Nvidia's market cap hit a staggering $3.34 trillion, eclipsing Microsoft (MSFT) to become the world's most valuable company. Over the next three trading days, on seemingly no fundamental news, the company shed $430 billion in market cap.

For perspective, Coca-Cola's (KO) market cap is $275 billion.

Some folks I talked with told me people were taking profits on Nvidia going into the start of the second half of the year. Others I talked to for my ""Opening Bid"" podcast told me there is some chatter about new competitors entering Nvidia's turf, and maybe the company won't be as absurdly dominant over the next five years as many anticipate.

All of that is fair, but it reinforces the view that the stock is prone to sharp, out-of-the-blue negative shifts in sentiment because it's up 3,000% in five years.

But if you drill down further, you can see just how intense the expectations on Nvidia have become.

Nvidia's stock now trades at about 21x (super steep) forward sales, up from 12x (also steep) two months ago, according to research from Creative Planning chief market strategist Charlie Bilello. This is a significant premium over Microsoft at 12x and Apple (AAPL) at 8x, two tech titans that are performing very well fundamentally and are likely to continue rocking years ahead.



Nvidia's stock recently traded about 100% above its 200-day moving average, BTIG chief market technician Jonathan Krinsky pointed out. Since 1990, the widest spread that any US company has ever traded above its 200-day moving average while it was the largest company in the world was 80% by Cisco (CSCO) in March 2000, which marked its all-time high. ""In other words, Nvidia is in a league of its own,"" Krinsky said.

It sure seems that way.

Similar expectations were applied to chipmaker Micron (MU) going into earnings this week. The stock got blasted due to ""in-line"" guidance that didn't meet crazy expectations for anything tied to AI demand.

And I emphasize crazy: On Monday, several sell-side analysts jacked up their estimates and price targets on Micron ahead of the report. As someone who used to manage a team of stock researchers, I can tell you that this action heading into an earnings report is not the norm.

It reeked of analysts buying into the hype too much and hoping for a giant one-day pop in the stock.

""When you get a reaction like Micron's, where the numbers should be good enough to avoid a sell-off, let alone spur a rally, that’s a bad sign — a tell that expectations are so high that they can't be exceeded,"" Interactive Brokers chief strategist Steve Sosnick told me.

Others don't agree with my assessment that Nvidia is priced for perfection, and that is totally fine. I don't have a monopoly on good ideas!

""But for medium- to longer-term investors, the story still holds when we look at how far out their capacity is booked and pricing is firming,"" Tematica Research co-founder and chief investment officer Chris Versace said.

One thing we can all agree on: Nvidia is a top-performing employee in the market, and it will get no pass for trying to take a day off if it catches a cold.

Speaking of expensive tech stocks, shares of Amazon (AMZN) are up 55% in the past year. Questions linger about its culture, however. WSJ reporter Dana Mattioli talked about her explosive new book ""The Everything War: Amazon’s Ruthless Quest to Own the World and Remake Corporate Power"" in an episode of the ""Opening Bid"" podcast.

Yahoo Finance,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/broadcom-stock-once-generation-investment-091300997.html,2024-06-30,09:13:00 UTC,Is Broadcom Stock a Once-in-a-Generation Investment Opportunity Ahead of Its 10-for-1 Stock Split on July 12?,"When Broadcom (NASDAQ: AVGO) released the results of its fiscal 2024 second quarter, ended May 5, the company delivered results that sailed past Wall Street's expectations. More intriguing for shareholders, however, was another development.

In conjunction with its financial report, Broadcom's management revealed a 10-for-1 stock split. Since its announcement on Jun 12, shares have climbed 6% (as of this writing), and the stock has gained 93% over the past year. This helps to illustrate the ongoing interest from investors, likely spurred higher by the vast opportunity represented by artificial intelligence (AI).

The stock split is scheduled to take place after the market close on Friday, July 12. Does the upcoming stock split make Broadcom a once-in-a-generation investment opportunity? Let's see what the evidence reveals.

Stock split recap

A quick review of the purpose of the stock split can help give this process context. If a company delivers strong operational and financial performance over an extended period, demand for stock ownership increases, which is reflected in an increasing share price. Unfortunately, this oft times makes the stock inaccessible to some everyday investors.

To rectify the situation, management can initiate a stock split, reducing the share price. The company noted in its report that the purpose of the split was ""to make ownership of Broadcom stock more accessible to investors and employees."" The result is that everyday investors will be better able to buy full shares rather than resorting to purchasing fractional shares, which are available at a number of brokerage firms.

Once the stock split is completed, shareholders of record will receive nine additional shares of Broadcom stock for every share they own. At the same time, the price of each share will be reduced to 1/10th of the price, so the total value of each shareholder's investment won't change.The stock is due to split after the market close on Friday July 12, and begin trading on a split-adjusted basis on Monday, July 15. What should be more important to investors, however, is that the same factors that have driven Broadcom stock higher in recent years will still be at work.

Is Broadcom stock a buy?

The process of the stock split aside, the quintessential investing question remains: Is Broadcom stock a buy before its highly publicized stock split? Let's take a look at the company's recent results.

In the second quarter, Broadcom reported revenue of $12.5 billion, jumping 43% year over year and 4% sequentially. This pushed adjusted earnings per share (EPS) of $10.96 up 6%. Management said robust demand for generative AI was driving the results, noting that sales of AI-related products surged to a record $3.1 billion and now accounted for 25% of the company's total revenue.

Story continues

Management suggested the trend will likely continue. Broadcom raised its full fiscal year guidance to $51 billion, which would represent year-over-year growth of 42%.

The company is also developing a consistent track record of dividend payments. Broadcom is now in its 14th consecutive year of increasing payouts. From humble beginnings in mid-2013, the company has increased its payout from $0.21 to $5.25 per quarter, an increase of 2,400%. Wall Street expects Broadcom to earn $47.49 per share in 2024. That works out to a payout ratio of 44% of this year's expected profits, based on the current quarterly dividend, so there's plenty of room to increase the payout.

A once-in-a-generation investment opportunity?

Most experts agree that the accelerating adoption of AI has only just begun, and demand will only grow from here. Because generative AI automates many time-consuming and mundane tasks, it increases productivity, which leads to higher profits.

While estimates vary considerably, the impact of generative AI on the economy is expected to be between $2.6 trillion to $4.4 trillion over the coming decade, according to research compiled by McKinsey & Company, representing a once-in-a-generation opportunity. It's worth noting, however, that estimates have been increasing over time, so the actual impact may be higher as new applications for AI are created. Broadcom's extensive reach in technology circles gives the company the potential to grab an increasingly larger piece of the AI pie.

Over the past five years, Broadcom has been on fire, as revenue increased 126%, driving net income up 197%. This, in turn, has driven the stock price up 463% during the same period (as of this writing), more than five times the returns of the S&P 500. Furthermore, the stock has gained 93% over the past year alone, as its pivotal place in the AI ecosystem is boosting its results.

Broadcom currently trades for 33 times forward earnings, which is a premium compared to a multiple of 28 for the S&P 500. However, given its significant outperformance over the past five years, its clear that Broadcom is deserving of a premium.

Given the company's strong track record of results, pervasive reach, and prevailing secular tailwinds, I would argue that the evidence supports the case that Broadcom is a once-in-a-generation investment opportunity ahead of its 10-for-1 stock split. That said, I don't think it matters if you buy Broadcom before or after the stock split — as long as you buy it.

Yahoo Finance,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/free-streaming-channels-have-become-sleeping-giants-as-netflix-max-others-hike-prices-154745358.html,2024-06-30,15:47:45 UTC,"Free streaming channels have become 'sleeping giants' as Netflix, Max, others hike prices","As streaming services get more expensive, consumers are increasingly turning to free content to fill out their entertainment diets.

Free ad-supported streaming platforms like the Roku Channel (ROKU), Fox affiliate Tubi (FOX), and Paramount's (PARA) Pluto TV, among others, have seen viewership steadily rise over the past few years, a surprising development given the lack of original content and heavy ad load on these channels, known as FAST channels.

FAST — which stands for free ad-supported streaming television — provides both linear and on-demand content in a single viewing experience that relies on advertising for monetization.

The rise of FAST comes as nearly every major streaming service has raised prices in recent months, including Paramount, Netflix (NFLX), Max (WBD), and Amazon (AMZN).

""It is different to be 100% free,"" Tubi CEO Anjali Sud said on the Ringer podcast ""The Town With Matthew Belloni"" in April.

""We're not asking you to subscribe to an ad tier or a subscription tier. We're not trying to upsell you. The fragmentation and friction is reduced.""

In other words, what appeals to users is the accessibility. Julie Clark, executive at marketing insights company TransUnion, described the model as a ""sleeping giant"" in the ever-evolving media landscape.

""FAST is easy, it's accessible,"" she told Yahoo Finance. ""You can get the basics that you need, like the news and the weather, but there's also older programming available and they're starting to have better distribution agreements there as well.""

To put it simply, FAST is the closest thing you can get to cable without actually paying for it. Not to mention that certain FAST providers, like the Roku Channel and Samsung's TV Plus, are also distributed across their respective smart TV devices, further broadening their presence for users.

""There's this catalog of content that is available within the FAST environment that you can binge all day,"" Clark said. ""And with recent price sensitivities, I think we're going to continue to see this grow.""

Content on FAST channels can encompass everything from made-for-TV movies and old shows from traditional studios to low-budget unscripted series, short-form videos, documentaries, and sports.

You still won't catch the new season of ""Bridgerton"" or the latest episode of ""The Bear."" But for cost-conscious consumers, that might not matter.

Tubi, which Fox acquired for $440 million in 2020, led year-over-year growth for the network following a nearly 5% monthly viewing increase in May, according to Nielsen. It secured a platform-best 1.8% of total TV usage for the month as a record 1 million viewers tuned in.

Story continues

Even more impressive? Its average audience for May came in ahead of traditional streamers Disney+, Peacock, Paramount+, and Max, Nielsen confirmed.

""A lot of people confuse Tubi as being sort of this passive FAST channel that is just on rotation in the background of a person's household. It's not,"" Fox CFO Steven Tomsic said at a MoffettNathanson conference last month. ""90% of Tubi consumption is [video on-demand] where it's a real lean-forward experience. People have deliberately chosen the title and watch through it.""

Tubi has experimented with original content, but its bread and butter revolves around its library. Tubi boasts more than 240,000 movies and TV series on its platform, the bulk of which is licensed. Its audience is 63% made up of ""cord cutters"" or ""cord nevers,"" while 40% are not subscribed to other traditional streamers.

Meanwhile, the Roku Channel, which has also dabbled in some original programming, saw a 1.3% monthly bump in viewing. That led the FAST provider to a platform-best 1.5% share of TV — the only company to climb in the rankings for May, nabbing 10th overall.

Competitors have taken notice. Bloomberg recently reported that Netflix is weighing its own free ad-supported tier in certain markets like Europe and Asia. It won't roll out a free version in the US since its subscriber base in the country is already heavily penetrated, according to the report.

But the FAST business model remains unproven. Tubi, for example, has yet to turn a profit. The long-term outlook also remains murky against the expected reacceleration of M&A within the media industry at large.

""I'm probably a little bit more cautious than others,"" Tim Nollen, analyst at Macquarie, told Yahoo Finance. He noted FAST providers must utilize a different strategic approach than other streamers, given their lack of premium or exclusive content.

""A lack of premium content means they have to be effective at using ad technology to target the users that they do have,"" Nollen said. ""It's a large audience, but it may not be a particularly engaged audience. I think they will be successful at using technology to target those users. But it might be in a somewhat different manner.""

Companies like Paramount, Fox, and Roku do not break out the financials of their respective FAST channels, although they're consistently called out as growth drivers on earnings calls.

Paramount, for instance, credited Pluto TV for its double-digit advertising revenue growth in the first quarter. Roku and Fox did the same.

The rise of ads on streaming

Advertising on connected TV, which refers to devices and platforms connected to the internet, has exploded in recent years. And it's not just FAST channels benefiting from the transition.

Companies like Netflix, Disney, and, most recently, Amazon have entered the ad-supported streaming space in recent years. That means more inventory and also more opportunities to better target and monetize consumers through technology.

""There's a lot of ability for advertisers to test, learn, and use sophisticated targeting that was only available within traditional digital advertising before,"" Clark told Yahoo Finance. ""That is absolutely leading to some of the growth in FAST and other ad-supported services.""

MoffettNathanson predicted total advertising on over-the-top streaming services will grow 33% this year, compared with a 17% increase in 2023, fueled by more consumers choosing ad-based streaming tiers.

""There's a comfort level [in] that value exchange,"" Clark said. ""Even younger consumers are getting used to ads on YouTube, so it's this natural progression.""

Ads are also easier to stomach if you know you're paying less (or nothing at all) to watch them.

""People value choice at the end of the day. And we have always been used to watching ads, whether it be on a cable network or on YouTube,"" said Vikrant Mathur, co-founder of Future Today, a company that specializes in ad-supported connected TV solutions.

""But now we have a choice. And if I can save money, I may be more willing to make that compromise.""

Yahoo Finance,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/6-yield-dividend-stock-help-122200961.html,2024-06-30,12:22:00 UTC,This 6% Yield Dividend Stock Can Help You Build Wealth Brick by Brick,"Investors who strive for a specific investment return should love dividends because they are concrete returns you can't lose once paid. For example, suppose you want to earn 10% on a stock you own for a year. If that stock pays a dividend yielding 5%, you're already halfway to your goal!

You can rest easier knowing you have something to show for your investment and aren't entirely at the mercy of Wall Street's (often irrational) volatility.

Realty Income (NYSE: O) is a well-known dividend stock. It's famous for paying a rare monthly dividend and continually increasing the amount it pays. The company has raised its dividend for 31 consecutive years and counting.

You may have overlooked Realty Income recently. Shares have fallen 24% over the past five years.

Pay attention. I'll show you how powerful dividend stocks like Realty Income can be and why the stock is a wonderful buy today.

Do dividends matter? More than you realize

Realty Income is a real estate investment trust, or REIT. It's a company that acquires and leases real estate. In other words, it's like a landlord you can invest in, so that you can enjoy the cash flow real estate earns without buying buildings. Realty Income specializes in single-tenant retail properties, where one tenant, generally a consumer-facing business like a movie theater, convenience store, or gas station, rents the building.

REITs must pay at least 90% of their taxable income as dividends, so companies like Realty Income make great dividend stocks. Realty Income's dividend yield is approximately 6% at its current share price. Now, I get it. Nobody wants to be down 24% after five years. But the truth is that Realty Income's dividend has helped soften that blow quite a bit.

While the stock price is down 24% after five years, the stock's total return, including dividends, has investors close to break-even.

To be fair to Realty Income, things have worked against the company these past five years. Real estate companies faced a generational crisis in COVID-19. Additionally, interest rates have surged higher. That's a problem for REITs because they rely heavily on borrowing to fund new property acquisitions. Realty Income has gotten a bad rap, primarily due to bad luck.

Ready to melt your mind? Zoom out further and see how big a difference dividends make over time. Realty Income has badly trailed the S&P 500 on price appreciation after decades, but it handily outperforms with dividends.

Realty Income's share price declines get all the attention. Ironically, the dividends created big returns over time. Again, Realty Income's stock is down due to bad luck (pandemic and high rates), not because it's a bad business.

Story continues

Why is the stock poised for a comeback?

I suspect that Realty Income will eventually bounce back. For starters, the dividend, the most crucial aspect of the stock, is rock-solid. Analysts believe Realty Income will earn $4.22 per share this year. That is a dividend payout ratio of just 75% based on its annualized dividend per share.

Meanwhile, many expect interest rates across the U.S. economy to fall over time. The FOMC, which controls the primary interest rate in the economy, has been looking for inflation to come down, and recent data points to precisely that happening. Lower rates mean cheaper borrowing, which is a tailwind for REITs like Realty Income.

Realty Income stock now yields near its decade-high, and its price versus its cash flow is near its decade-low. That means the stock is cheap, and analysts still see Realty Income growing its distributable cash (profits for REITs) at a low-single-digit rate annually. Investors are looking at potential double-digit total returns when combining dividends and growth. A potentially higher valuation is just a bonus.

Remember, stocks like Realty Income can make you rich with their dividends. It just might take time. Investors should have no concerns over the dividend moving forward, and the stock's potential rebound is more icing on the cake than the main course.

Situations like this are how long-term investors win.

Yahoo Finance,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/stock-influencer-roaring-kitty-discloses-102219227.html,2024-07-01,10:22:19 UTC,Chewy jumps 15% as filing shows 'Roaring Kitty' takes stake,"(Reuters) -Shares of Chewy rose 15% premarket on Monday after a filing showed Keith Gill, the stock influencer known as ""Roaring Kitty"", had picked up a 6.6% stake in the pet products e-retailer.

The filing with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission comes days after the investor, known for triggering the meme-stock rally of 2021, posted an uncaptioned picture of a puppy on social media platform X that briefly sent Chewy shares to a near one-year high on Thursday.

The filing, which lists Keith Gill as the reporting person, included a section ""Check the appropriate box to designate whether you are a cat"" under which the descriptor ""I am not a cat"" was checked.

The U.S. SEC, Chewy and Gill did not immediately respond to requests for comment.

Gill usually discloses his trading positions on platforms such as YouTube and Reddit, where he is known as ""DeepFuckingValue"", to the many retail traders who follow his cues.

The filing showed Gill owns 9 million shares of Chewy, equating to a stake worth about $245 million at the stock's Friday closing price of $27.24. The stake would make Gill Chewy's third-largest shareholder, according to LSEG data.

Chewy rival Petco Health and Wellness Company's shares fell 4%, reversing earlier gains.

Shares of Chewy, which sells pet food as well as medicine online, have risen 15% so far in 2024 but declined in the three preceding years as spending on pets slowed after a post-pandemic boom.

Its sales have been stable in the past few quarters despite weaker consumer spending on discretionary items. ""Pet humanization"" is a key part of Chewy's strategy, where owners splurge on pets as they are considered part of the family.

Some analysts said last week Gill's interest in Chewy could also be influenced by the fact that the pet retailer was founded by GameStop CEO Ryan Cohen.

GameStop had gained nearly 700% in the 2021 meme-stock rally, fueled by Gill's posts. Gill returned to Reddit on June 2 after a years-long hiatus, with a screenshot disclosing a sizeable GameStop stock and options position.

Shares of the videogame retailer have swung wildly since Gill reappeared. They dropped 5.7% in volatile premarket trading on Monday, but have gained 40% for the year so far.

Yahoo Finance,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/forget-nvidia-heres-another-spectacular-092100205.html,2024-06-30,09:21:00 UTC,"Forget Nvidia: Here's Another Spectacular Semiconductor Stock to Buy Right Now, According to Wall Street","I'm being facetious when I tell you to forget Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA). After all, how can you ignore a stock that soared nearly tenfold in just 18 months and now has a $3.1 trillion market cap, which accounts for 6.7% of the entire S&P 500 index? Not to mention, the company's chips are the driving force behind artificial intelligence (AI).

However, the incredible run in Nvidia stock made it quite expensive, even relative to its expected earnings a couple of years from now. Nvidia isn't the only chipmaker reaping the rewards of AI, so investors might find better value in other stocks in this space.

Micron Technology (NASDAQ: MU) is one to consider. The overwhelming majority of the analysts tracked by The Wall Street Journal give it the highest possible buy rating, with none recommending selling. Here's why.

Image source: Getty Images.

Micron is catching a tailwind from AI

Nvidia's graphics processing units (GPUs) are critical for AI development. However, memory chips are a key component of those GPUs. They basically give AI models short-term memory, storing data in a ready state where it can be instantly called upon either for training purposes or when a user queries a chatbot.

Micron makes the world's leading HBM3E (HBM stands for high-bandwidth memory) for the data center. HBM3E's architecture provides a higher bandwidth than previous generations of memory (like DDR), while occupying a smaller physical footprint that also consumes less energy. This means mountains of data can be transferred more quickly while reducing electricity costs. Both factors are top of mind for data center operators.

Micron's HBM3E is so efficient that Nvidia is using it in its latest GPUs, including in the new H200, which can inference AI models (ingest live data and make predictions) twice as fast as its flagship H100.

During the recent fiscal 2024 third quarter (ended May 30), Micron said its data center HBM solutions contributed $100 million in revenue. The company expects total HBM revenue to be in the hundreds of millions of dollars at the close of fiscal 2024 (ending Aug. 31), and several billions of dollars in fiscal 2025. In fact, all of Micron's supply is completely sold out for next year already.

But Micron's AI opportunity doesn't stop at the data center, because AI-enabled personal computers (PCs) require up to 80% more memory (DRAM) capacity than traditional PCs. Micron says Microsoft's new Copilot+ AI PC comes with a minimum DRAM content of 16GB, whereas the previous generation came with an 8GB option. Similarly, AI-enabled smartphones require up to double the memory capacity of their predecessors.

Story continues

These trends will lead to more money in the door for Micron.

Micron's revenue is soaring, thanks to AI

Micron generated $6.8 billion in revenue during Q3, representing year-over-year growth of 81%. That marked an acceleration from the prior quarter when revenue grew by 57%, which speaks to how quickly demand for AI is ramping up.

Beneath the surface of the headline number, the results were even more impressive. Micron's compute and networking (data center) business, which is the largest of its four segments, grew revenue by 85% in the last year. Its mobile segment expanded even faster, with revenue soaring by 94% as the world's leading smartphone manufacturers race to integrate AI into their flagship devices.

Micron also delivered a strong result at the bottom line. It generated $0.30 in earnings per share during Q3, which was a big swing from its $1.73 loss per share from the year-ago period. It was also above the high end of management's guidance of $0.24.

As I touched on earlier, supply of products like HBM3E is now sold out until the end of 2025, and those supply constraints give Micron the ability to charge higher prices. It translated to improved profitability in Q3, and that tailwind should persist for at least the next year.

Wall Street is very bullish on Micron stock

Micron stock is up 72% so far this year and trading near an all-time high, but that hasn't deterred Wall Street. The Wall Street Journal tracks 38 analysts covering the stock, and 27 give it the highest possible buy rating. A further seven are in the overweight (bullish camp), and two recommend holding. Although two analysts have assigned Micron an underweight (bearish) rating, none recommend outright selling.

Micron's fiscal year 2024 wraps up in August. Its final earnings result will be compromised by weakness at the start of the year, stemming from an inventory glut in its consumer-oriented segments. But analysts already turned their attention to fiscal 2025, when they expect Micron to deliver $9.06 in earnings per share — based on its closing stock price of $142.36 on June 26, which places it at a forward price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio of just 15.7.

For perspective, the iShares Semiconductor ETF trades at a P/E ratio of 35.9 today, implying Micron stock will have to more than double within the next year just to trade in line with its peers in the chip industry (assuming Wall Street's earnings forecast is accurate). Plus, Nvidia trades at a forward P/E ratio of 46.6, which makes Micron stock look like an even better value.

Since Micron's HBM3E memory is a key component in many of Nvidia's latest GPUs, any investor who thinks Nvidia will do well should also consider adding Micron to their portfolio, especially at the current price.

Yahoo Finance,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/wall-street-thinks-high-flying-095000030.html,2024-07-01,09:50:00 UTC,Wall Street Thinks These High-Flying Artificial Intelligence (AI) Stocks Are Headed Lower (Hint: Nvidia Isn't 1 of Them),"What's the modern-day equivalent to King Midas turning everything he touched to gold? Artificial intelligence (AI) is a top candidate. Many AI stocks have delivered sizzling gains over the past 18 months. Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA) is the most famous example, with the demand for its AI chips helping push the company's market cap above $3 trillion.

But all good things eventually come to an end. Although analysts still think Nvidia has some room to run, they're not as optimistic about every AI stock. Here are three high-flying AI stocks Wall Street thinks are headed lower.

1. Arm Holdings

Shares of Arm Holdings (NASDAQ: ARM) have skyrocketed more than 120% year to date. That gain isn't as great as Nvidia's, but it's in the same ballpark.

Arm designs semiconductors and software used extensively in central processing units (CPUs). The company's revenue soared 47% year over year in its latest quarter to $928 million -- an all-time high. Over half of this revenue came from royalties paid by customers using its chip architecture.

AI is a key growth driver for Arm. The company thinks the demand for energy-efficient AI capabilities in data centers and edge devices will lead to higher sales for its technology. It's especially upbeat about the prospects for Nvidia's Grace Blackwell Superchip which uses Nvidia's Blackwell graphics processing unit (GPU) architecture combined with Arm's Grace CPU.

However, Wall Street isn't bullish about Arm's near-term prospects. The average 12-month price target for the stock is 29% below the current share price. The most pessimistic analyst predicts Arm's share price could sink 65%.

2. Palantir

Palantir Technologies (NYSE: PLTR) is another big AI winner. Shares of the data analytics software developer are up nearly 50% in 2024 thanks mainly to a big jump in February.

The company's flagship product is its Artificial Intelligence Platform (AIP). Palantir's revenue jumped 21% year over year in the first quarter of 2024 to $634 million, fueled largely by AIP's momentum.

Ryan Taylor, Palantir's Chief Revenue Officer and Chief Legal Officer, said in the company's Q1 earnings call that ""AIP's applications seem endless."" He stated, ""We've shared our plans to capture the market with AIP. And our results show that our strategy is not only succeeding, it is accelerating.""

Despite the prospects for AIP, analysts think Palantir's momentum will soon screech to a halt. The average 12-month price target for the stock is roughly 15% below the current share price.

Story continues

3. Arista Networks

Arista Networks (NYSE: ANET) has taken investors on a roller-coaster rise this year. However, the ride has been fun overall for investors, with Arista's shares soaring 50%.

The company provides cloud networking technology. AI has served as a significant tailwind as organizations migrate rapidly to the cloud to train and deploy large language models (LLMs). Arista has been a direct beneficiary of the trend, with its revenue jumping more than 16% year over year in Q1 to $1.57 billion.

Arista CEO Jayshree Ullal thinks more growth is on the way. She estimates the total addressable market in client-to-cloud AI networking is at least $60 billion. And she views this market as Arista's to win.

Wall Street isn't overly pessimistic about Arista, but it's not optimistic either. The average 12-month price target for the stock is around 6% lower than the current share price.

Is Wall Street right about these AI stocks?

Maybe analysts' price targets for Arm, Palantir, and Arista will prove prescient; maybe they won't. No one knows for sure how any stock will perform over the next 12 months.

I will note, though, that the growth prospects for all three AI stocks seem to be largely baked into their share prices already. The price-to-earnings-to-growth (PEG) ratios for Arm, Palantir, and Arista based on five-year growth projections are close to or above 2.0.

My view is that these stocks are likely to continue winning over the long term. However, I wouldn't be surprised if any or all of them pull back somewhat over the next 12 months.

Don’t miss this second chance at a potentially lucrative opportunity

Ever feel like you missed the boat in buying the most successful stocks? Then you’ll want to hear this.

On rare occasions, our expert team of analysts issues a “Double Down” stock recommendation for companies that they think are about to pop. If you’re worried you’ve already missed your chance to invest, now is the best time to buy before it’s too late. And the numbers speak for themselves:

Amazon: if you invested $1,000 when we doubled down in 2010, you’d have $21,765 !*

Apple: if you invested $1,000 when we doubled down in 2008, you’d have $39,798 !*

Netflix: if you invested $1,000 when we doubled down in 2004, you’d have $363,957!*

Right now, we’re issuing “Double Down” alerts for three incredible companies, and there may not be another chance like this anytime soon.

Yahoo Finance,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/2-stocks-could-crush-nasdaq-092000151.html,2024-07-01,09:20:00 UTC,2 Stocks That Could Crush the Nasdaq Over the Next Five Years,"The Nasdaq Composite has returned an average annual return of 11% over the last 30 years. That comes out to a cumulative return of 2,440%. That's an enviable return on investment over the long term. If you want to beat that return, you need to invest in stocks with above-average growth prospects.

Stock prices can fluctuate for all kinds of reasons in the near term, so trying to beat the market day to day is a fool's errand. However, over many years, there is a high correlation between a company's earnings performance and the stock's return. If you focus on companies that can at least double their earnings in five years, which comes to an annualized earnings increase of 15%, you significantly stack the odds in your favor of beating the market.

To give you some ideas, here are two top stocks that have the potential to double in value in five years and outperform the Nasdaq.

1. Carnival

Carnival (NYSE: CCL) is the largest cruise line in the world and continues to benefit from strong demand. The stock is up 18% over the past year, and while that is less than the Nasdaq's return of 33%, Carnival's prospects for improving earnings growth in the coming years could potentially double the share price over the next five years.

With revenue growing at a healthy rate due to strong demand for cruise vacations, management is focusing more on managing costs to deliver profitable growth. In the May-ended quarter, Carnival posted a 17% year-over-year increase in revenue and turned a year-ago loss into a net profit of $92 million.

Looking ahead, Carnival should drive higher margins and profits from two opportunities. The first is next year's planned opening of Celebration Key, an exclusive destination that is close to Carnival's ports and should lower fuel costs to boost profits. Strong demand for travel to this new destination will allow the company to gradually raise ticket prices over time and realize high returns on the company's investment.

Another opportunity for profitable growth is the transfer of Carnival's vessels from its P&O Cruises Australia brand into Carnival Cruise Line, which will expand capacity for the better-performing Carnival brand.

Wall Street analysts expect Carnival to grow earnings at an annualized rate of 12% over the long term. If the stock's forward price-to-earnings ratio moves up from its current 16.3 multiple to 20, which is more in line with its pre-pandemic valuation range, Carnival stock could double in value in the next five years.

2. Uber Technologies

Uber Technologies (NYSE: UBER) continues to grow revenue thanks to a large base of 7 million people earning money with its service every month. The stock has climbed 66% over the past year, effectively doubling the Nasdaq's return of 33%, but the stock has plenty of room to run in the coming years.

Story continues

Uber's first-quarter results show the business growing at the rates investors need to double their money. In the first quarter, gross bookings, revenue, and the number of trips each grew 15% or higher year over year.

One important catalyst could drive strong earnings growth over the next five years. Uber is using its valuable data to offer advertising to connect merchants with consumers. The company launched Uber Journey Ads in 2022, which helps brands gain exposure to consumers using Uber, and it's growing into a multibillion-dollar opportunity.

Uber achieved $900 million of annualized advertising revenue in the fourth quarter of 2023. It's a small piece of a business generating over $10 billion of quarterly revenue, but advertising generates high margins that can benefit its low-margin delivery business.

Piper Sandler analysts called Uber a ""sleeping giant"" in advertising recently due to its large customer base. The consensus estimate has Uber's earnings reaching $4.31 by 2026 and growing 45% on an annualized basis over the next several years. This puts Uber stock on track to double in value within the next five years.

Yahoo Finance,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/2-ultra-high-yield-dividend-102400016.html,2024-06-30,10:24:00 UTC,2 Ultra-High-Yield Dividend Stocks Billionaires Are Buying Left and Right: Could They Be Smart Buys for You in July?,"If you're an investor who doesn't already have access to billions in capital, you could probably learn a few things from the folks who do. Luckily, keeping tabs on the world's most successful investors isn't very hard to do.

Every three months, people managing a portfolio worth $100 million or more have to report their trading activity to the Securities and Exchange Commission. A quick look at the latest disclosures shows a handful of billionaire investors bought millions of shares of two dividend-paying stocks that currently offer ultra-high yields.

Shares of Pfizer (NYSE: PFE) and Annaly Capital (NYSE: NLY) offer yields that are several times the average stock in the benchmark S&P 500 index. Unfortunately, stocks rarely offer yields this high unless there's a good reason to worry about their ability to maintain their payout.

Let's look at their recent performance to find out if following the lead of billionaire fund managers makes sense for your portfolio.

Annaly Capital

Annaly Capital is a real estate investment trust (REIT) that buys mortgage-backed securities (MBSes) instead of real estate. It earns a living in the margins between its short-term borrowing expenses and the interest it receives from the hopefully higher-yielding MBS in its portfolio.

At recent prices, Annaly shares offer a mind-blowing 13.6% yield. The enormous yield is attracting funds run by billionaires. Citadel Advisors, which is run by Ken Griffin, and Millennium Management, which is run by Israel Englander, bought shares in the first quarter.

Annaly Capital doesn't own real estate, so it has to use its MBS portfolio to secure loans. It doesn't happen often, but from time to time, the value of its MBS can dip. When this happens, lenders demand more capital, and the company can end up selling off portions of its portfolio at fire sale prices.

NLY Dividend Chart

Before you jump up to fill your portfolio with shares of Annaly Capital, it's important to realize the company has lowered its dividend by 45.8% since 2019. Investors who bought the stock and reinvested all the dividends have gained only about 39% over the past decade.

While there's a good chance that buying Annaly Capital now and holding over the long run also leads to positive gains, the unpredictability of its dividend makes it a bad choice for most income-seeking investors.

Pfizer

During the first three months of 2024, John Overdeck and David Siegel of Two Sigma bought 18.9 million shares of Pfizer. The stock has fallen by more than half since its peak in late 2021.

Story continues

Pfizer's been dropping because record-breaking sales of its COVID-19-related products evaporated faster than the market expected. Now that the worst is over, though, the stock looks like a terrific bargain.

Pfizer's stock dropped, but the company still raised its dividend payout for the 15th consecutive year last December. The stock offers a 6.2% yield at recent prices, which is about 4.6 times more than you'd receive from the average dividend payer in the S&P 500.

At recent prices, you can buy Pfizer for around 11.6 times forward-looking earnings expectations. That's a reasonable valuation for a business you expect to grow at a snail's pace. A look at this drugmaker's recent performance and forward outlook suggests it will grow much faster than the market is expecting.

Pfizer invested heaps of COVID-19-related profits into new drugs, many of which are already on the market. If we exclude COVID-19-related sales and the negative effects of a stronger U.S. dollar, first-quarter sales rose 11% year over year.

Pfizer has the longest list of innovative new drugs in the pharmaceutical industry, and it's still growing relatively quickly. The FDA approved nine new medicines from the company in 2023, and they're poised to drive growth in the decade ahead. Adding some shares to a diversified portfolio looks like a relatively safe way for income-seeking investors to boost their passive income stream.

One term that encompasses all of this is ‘money dysmorphia.'

So, what is money dysmorphia?

Don't Miss:

Can you guess how many retire with a $5,000,000 nest egg? – How does it compare to the average?

Warren Buffett flipped his neighbor's $67,000 life savings into a $50 million fortune — How much is that worth today?

""Money dysmorphia is when you have a warped or distorted view of your finances,"" Danielle Desir, a personal finance expert and host of ""The Thought Card"" podcast, told HuffPost. ""You see your financial situation much differently from your reality. Money dysmorphia can be caused by a variety of reasons, including past money trauma, societal pressures, economic crisis, or could be deeply rooted in childhood upbringing.""

A recent Credit Karma study shows that 29% of Americans experience money dysmorphia, and the problem is much greater for younger generations. About 43% of Gen Z and 41% of Millennials experience money dysmorphia, compared to 25% of Gen X and 14% of Boomers.

Elizabeth Ayoola, a personal finance writer at NerdWallet, told HuffPost that those with money dysmorphia often view their finances subjectively rather than objectively. This skewed perception can manifest in several ways:

Saving excessively : Some people may save excessively because they feel they are falling behind their peers.

Overspending : This becomes a problem for people who feel they are more financially secure than they are.

Strong emotional reactions : Experiencing anxiety, sadness, frustration, or unworthiness when confronted with friends' financial milestones can be a sign of money dysmorphia, especially when it leads to unnecessary spending.

Lifestyle choices : People may live lifestyles they can't afford, or conversely, may be financially secure but deny themselves enjoyment because they think they don't have enough.

Obsessive behaviors: Constantly checking bank balances, avoiding discussing finances, comparing oneself to others, and feeling guilty about necessary purchases are common among people with money dysmorphia.

Trending: Miami is expected to take New York's place as the U.S. Financial Capital. Here's how you can invest in the city before that happens.

Social media has not helped the issue. When people share the parts of their lives that appear more extravagant, it evokes a sense of needing to ""keep up with the Joneses."" Seeing the seemingly perfect lives of others can skew one's perception of their finances.

Story continues

Another reason for many struggling with money dysmorphia is this obsession with being rich. Credit Karma says that 27% of Americans are obsessed with the idea of being rich, and of those with money dysmorphia, 54% are obsessed with wanting to be rich.

Courtney Alev, a consumer financial advocate at Credit Karma, says there are a few ways individuals can overcome money dysmorphia:

Take an honest look at your finances.

Set clear goals.

Make a plan.

Stop comparing yourself to others.

""If your goal is to build up your savings,"" she says, ""start by doing an audit of your finances to see where in your budget you can make room for savings. From there, you can schedule automatic payments from each paycheck to help hold you accountable and incrementally increase your savings.""

Addressing money dysmorphia requires a blend of self-awareness, education, and sometimes even professional guidance. Recognizing these signs in yourself is the first step toward reclaiming a healthier relationship with finances. Whether saving excessively, overspending, or constantly comparing your financial situation to others, seeking support from a financial advisor can provide invaluable perspective and practical strategies tailored to your individual needs.

For investors seeking reliable returns, energy stocks with a consistent history of dividend payouts are a solid choice. Here, we spotlight three such companies—Kinder Morgan, Enterprise Products Partners, and Delek Logistics Partners—each renowned for their strong dividend growth and solid dividend yields.

Kinder Morgan

Kinder Morgan, Inc. (NYSE:KMI) is one of North America’s largest energy infrastructure companies. It owns and operates around 82,000 miles of pipelines and 139 terminals. These pipelines transport natural gas, refined petroleum products, crude oil, condensate, CO2, renewable fuels, and other products, while the terminals store and handle commodities like gasoline, diesel, jet fuel, chemicals, metals, and ethanol.

Kinder Morgan has maintained dividend payments for 14 consecutive years and increased them for the past 6 years. The company pays a quarterly dividend of $0.2875 per share, or $1.15 annually, yielding 5.81%.

Over the past twelve months, Kinder Morgan generated $15.28 billion in revenue and $2.45 billion in net income.

Trending: Commercial real estate has historically outperformed the stock market, but few investors have the capital or resources needed to invest in this asset class. This platform allows individuals to invest in commercial real estate.

Enterprise Products Partners

Enterprise Products Partners L.P. (NYSE:EPD) is a leading provider of midstream energy services in North America. The company offers services to producers and consumers of natural gas, natural gas liquids (NGLs), crude oil, refined products, and petrochemicals.

Enterprise Products Partners has maintained dividend payments for 27 consecutive years and increased them for 26 years. The company pays a quarterly dividend of $0.515 per share, or $2.06 annually, yielding 7.21%.

The stock is up more than 12% YTD, and the company has beaten EPS and revenue consensus estimates for the last two quarters.

Over the past twelve months, Enterprise Products Partners generated $52.03 billion in revenue and $5.59 billion in net income.

Don’t Miss: If there was a new fund backed by Jeff Bezos offering a 7-9% target yield with monthly dividends would you invest in it?

Delek Logistics Partners

Delek Logistics Partners, LP (NYSE:DKL) provides a range of energy logistics services through its assets and joint ventures primarily in the Permian Basin, Delaware Basin, and Gulf Coast region. The company offers gathering, pipeline, and other transportation services for crude oil and natural gas customers, as well as storage and wholesale marketing for intermediate and refined products. Additionally, it provides water disposal and recycling services.

Story continues

Delek Logistics has maintained dividend payments for 12 consecutive years and increased them for 11 years. The company pays a quarterly dividend of $1.07 per share, or $4.28 annually, yielding 10.82%.

Over the past twelve months, Delek Logistics generated $1.02 billion in revenue and $121.5 million in net income.

Looking For Higher-Yield Opportunities?

The current high-interest-rate environment has created an incredible opportunity for income-seeking investors to earn massive yields, but not through dividend stocks...

Yahoo Finance,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/buy-broadcom-stock-hand-over-094900953.html,2024-07-01,09:49:00 UTC,Should You Buy Broadcom Stock Hand Over Fist Before Its 10-for-1 Stock Split?,"Broadcom's (NASDAQ: AVGO) share price nearly doubled last year. The stock is up over 45% so far in 2024. That's great news for shareholders. However, for some investors, this tremendous success pushed Broadcom's share price so high (over $1,600) that they were reluctant to buy.

That won't be a problem for too much longer. In its first-quarter update a few weeks ago, Broadcom announced plans for a 10-for-1 stock split after the market close on July 12, 2024. The semiconductor and software maker's shares will trade on a split-adjusted basis beginning July 15, 2024.

Broadcom CFO Kirsten Spears said the purpose of this stock split for ""to make ownership of Broadcom stock more accessible to investors and employees."" Some believe this greater accessibility could provide a nice catalyst for the already high-flying stock. Should you buy Broadcom stock hand over fist before its 10-for-1 stock split?

The case for Broadcom

Historically, stocks have jumped 25% during the 12 months following a stock split announcement, according to the Bank of America Research Investment Committee. Broadcom's shares have risen only around 8% since the announcement of its stock split, so it could still have plenty of room to run if history is a guide.

Are there reasons to buy Broadcom stock other than a potential stock split surge? Absolutely. I'd put the company's acquisition of VMware near the top of the list. This deal contributed significantly to Broadcom's revenue soaring 43% year over year in the second quarter of 2024. Earlier this year, Broadcom CEO Hock Tan said that the company expects VMWare's revenue growth will accelerate through the remainder of fiscal 2024.

However, the biggest reason to buy Broadcom stock is its artificial intelligence (AI) opportunity. Seven of the eight largest AI clusters in the world use Broadcom's Ethernet technology. Broadcom expects its networking revenue to jump 40% this year primarily due to AI-related demand.

The company's AI accelerator business is highly profitable. Creating networks to connect AI accelerators is complicated. But Broadcom is arguably the best at doing it. As Tan said in the Q2 earnings call, the company has ""the deepest and broadest understanding of what it takes for complex large workloads to be scaled out in an AI fabric.""

Broadcom is also a free cash flow (FCF) machine. In Q2, the company generated FCF of $4.4 billion -- 36% of total revenue. If we exclude the cash Broadcom used for restructuring and integration, its FCF rose 18% year over year to $5.3 billion and made up 42% of revenue.

Story continues

The case against Broadcom

Despite the excitement about Broadcom's stock split, it won't change anything about the company's underlying business. Also, investors who wanted to buy the stock but were leery of its high share price could have done so with fractional shares.

Broadcom's growth story wouldn't be nearly as impressive without the VMWare deal. Excluding VMWare, Q2 revenue increased by only 12% year over year. The company won't be able to rely on the acquisition to boost its year-over-year numbers after Q4, since the transaction closed on Nov. 22, 2023.

Some parts of Broadcom's business remain weak. Wireless revenue in Q2 rose only 2% year over year. Server storage connectivity revenue fell 27%. Broadband revenue plunged 39%.

Just five customers generate roughly 40% of total sales. Apple alone makes up 17% of Broadcom's total revenue. This reliance on a small number of customers presents a key risk for Broadcom.

The company's AI opportunity is big. However, Nvidia could emerge as a strong competitor to Broadcom in Ethernet switching and custom AI accelerators.

There's also a potential valuation concern. Broadcom stock trades at nearly 34 times forward earnings and 16.7 times trailing 12-month sales.

Buy before the split?

I don't think investors should be in a rush to buy Broadcom stock before its stock split. My hunch is that the split will be largely a non-event rather than a major catalyst.

That said, Broadcom could remain a winner over the long term. Patient investors could buy now, wait until the stock split, or hold off for a pullback to buy on the dip. If you plan on owning Broadcom for 10 years or more, the exact timing of when you buy probably won't matter all that much.

“What we found was some stark differences in approaches to investing and mindset toward overall investing,” Michael Pelzar, head of investments at Bank of America Private Bank, told Yahoo Finance.

Market research company Escalent surveyed 1,007 high-net-worth Americans on behalf of Bank of America Private Bank. The respondents, who were divided into a younger cohort (ages 21 to 43) and an older cohort (44 and older), had a minimum of $3 million in investable assets apart from their primary residence.

(Source: 2024 Bank of America Private Bank Study of Wealthy Americans)

Here's what Bank of America discovered about the younger investors surveyed:

47% of the younger cohort's portfolios are invested in stocks and bonds. That's much lower than the older cohort (74%).

More younger investors are invested in alternative assets than older investors, and almost all of the younger cohort (93%) said they plan to allocate more to alternatives in the next few years.

Nearly half (49%) of the young cohort own cryptocurrencies, and 38% expressed some interest. Behind real estate, this cohort ranked crypto as the top area for opportunity.

45% of the younger cohort own physical gold as an asset, and another 45% said they are interested in owning it.

Differences in financial outlooks drove the disparities in investment allocations and where investors perceive opportunities to be.

Notably, over 70% of younger wealthy investors no longer think it's possible to achieve above-average investment returns by investing exclusively in a mix of stocks and bonds. In contrast, only 28% of older investors share that view.

Bank of America

Younger investors' skepticism over traditional investments comes as the stock market has ripped higher in 2024. As Myles Udland wrote this week, the S&P 500 (^GSPC) is up 42% since the beginning of 2023, pacing an annualized rate of return near 26%, or almost three times the average 10% yearly return of the index over time.

However, Pelzar saw this difference in viewpoint as “somewhat understandable,” citing the turbulence the younger generation has experienced in their investing lives.

“The younger generation has seen in their investing lives two market crashes … and then over the course of the last few years, they’ve seen an increasing correlation between stocks and bonds,” Pelzar said. “And so that’s really colored their thinking around how they need to allocate assets in order to generate the returns they look for.”

The survey revealed that the younger cohort focused their asset allocation on alternatives, and many expressed plans to allocate even more to these investments in the next few years.

Pelzar said this projected increase is “largely reflective” of the younger cohort’s thoughts on the growth opportunities in the market. Because some of the alternative asset classes are less liquid, Pelzar said this implies that the younger generation is taking a longer-term view.

“You see a much different profile between those two different cohorts, and I think that indicates lessons learned or things we need to be thinking about in terms of the investment landscape going forward,” he said.

Yahoo Finance,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/boeing-buy-spirit-aero-4-041118022.html,2024-07-01,04:11:18 UTC,Spirit Aero to be broken up as Boeing agrees $4.7 billion stock deal,"By Tim Hepher, Shivani Tanna and Mike Stone

(Reuters) -Boeing agreed to buy back Spirit AeroSystems for $4.7 billion in stock and Airbus moved to take on the supplier's loss-making Europe-focused activities in return for hundreds of millions of dollars of compensation following months of talks.

The near-two-decade independence of the world's largest standalone aerostructures company ended in a carve-up between its largest customers after the latest Boeing 737 MAX crisis, sparked by a mid-air door plug blowout in January, brought to a head doubts over the resilience of fuselage manufacturing.

Boeing, which spun off Spirit in 2005, said it would repurchase its former subsidiary for about $37.25 per share, as reported by Reuters on Sunday, giving it an enterprise value of $8.3 billion including debt.

""Bringing Spirit and Boeing together will enable greater integration of both companies' manufacturing and engineering capabilities, including safety and quality systems,"" Spirit CEO Pat Shanahan said in a statement.

Spirit shares rose some 8% in premarket trading, while Boeing dipped by just under 1%.

The Wichita, Kansas-based company said the deal offered a 30% premium versus the day before Boeing and Spirit announced talks to bring the struggling supplier back in house on March 1.

Boeing has long pondered buying back its former subsidiary, which analysts say has struggled to thrive independently despite diversifying into work for Europe's Airbus and others.

The decision to go ahead comes as Boeing tries to resolve a sprawling corporate and industrial crisis that has engulfed one of the industry's key suppliers.

Boeing is trying to move past months of difficulties sparked by the Jan. 5 blowout of a door plug on a virtually new Alaska Airlines 737 MAX 9 jet that exposed quality problems.

Those issues have led to a substantial slowdown in output at Boeing, rippling across the global commercial aviation industry.

The U.S. planemaker has also announced the planned departure of CEO Dave Calhoun in the wake of the crisis, with industry executives and analysts pointing to Spirit's Shanahan, a former senior Boeing executive, as one of the possible replacements.

It was not immediately clear how long he might be tied to Spirit, with the Boeing deal not due to close until mid-2025.

In a note to investors, Bernstein analyst Douglas Harned said the deal ""should add clarity ... potentially for the Boeing board’s attention to move to the decision on the next CEO"".

AIRBUS DEAL

Spirit, the manufacturer of the door plug, had been spun off from Boeing in one of a series of moves that critics say were emblematic of a focus on cost-cutting over quality.

Story continues

Boeing made the decision to buy back Spirit in the aftermath of the door plug blowout, in what it described as an effort to address its safety problems and shore up its production line.

That raised questions over the future of work that Spirit caries out for Boeing's arch-rival Airbus, prompting the CEO of the European giant to warn in April that it stood ready if necessary to veto changes in control of Airbus-related plants.

On Monday, Airbus said it would take over core activities at four of the supplier's plants in the United States, Northern Ireland, France and Morocco as reported by Reuters last week.

It will also take over minor work currently carried out in Wichita. The separate Airbus deal was triggered by talks between Boeing and Spirit and was loosely coordinated between the three companies, sources said. It is subject to due diligence.

Airbus shares were up by about 2% in Monday morning trade.

Because Spirit's Airbus-related activities lose money, industry sources had said the European planemaker was pressing for up to $1 billion in compensation in return for taking over the plants, which make strategic parts for its A350 and A220 airliners.

Airbus said it would receive $559 million in compensation from Spirit, depending on the final outlines of the deal, while it would pay the supplier a symbolic $1 for the assets.

That echoes its decision to buy the Canadian-designed CSeries small jetliner program for just $1 from Bombardier in 2018. It later renamed the jet the A220.

Until the latest shake-up, Airbus had not envisaged taking control of the loss-making A220 wings manufacturing carried out in Belfast, which Spirit bought from Bombardier in 2019.

Monday's deal lifts doubts over the future of part of Northern Ireland's top industrial employer, though sources have said Airbus may need to invest significant sums to increase output and make the wings more affordable to produce.

Spirit said it planned to sell operations in Prestwick, Scotland and in Subang, Malaysia that support Airbus programs and those in Belfast that do not support Airbus programs.

Yahoo Finance,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/senator-questioning-plug-powers-government-160700242.html,2024-06-30,16:07:00 UTC,"With a Senator Questioning Plug Power's Government Loan, Is This an Opportunity to Buy the Stock?","Shares of Plug Power (NASDAQ: PLUG) surged in May after the company announced that it had received a conditional commitment for a $1.66 billion loan from the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE). However, the stock is now well below where it was before the announcement, and one U.S. senator has called the loan into question.

The stock, meanwhile, is now down over 70% in the past year.

Let's look at the proposed DOE loan, why it is being called into question, why it is so important for Plug Power, and whether the slide in the stock is a buying opportunity.

Fixing a flawed business model

Plug Power has long been grappling with a flawed business model, which it has set out to fix. The company initially found a niche selling fuel cells used in forklifts and other material-handling equipment to companies with high-volume, three-shift warehouses like Amazon and Walmart.

But the flaw in its business model was that it would sell the hydrogen fuel needed to run its fuel cells at a loss. This could be seen in the company's most recent results, where negative gross margin led to a $159 million gross loss.

Just to emphasize how bad this is, the loss was measured before any corporate costs. The company loses a lot of money on the hydrogen fuel it sells, although in the first quarter, it also lost money on the equipment it sold.

Obviously, acquiring or making something for $3 and then selling it for $1 is not a durable business model, but that is pretty close to what Plug Power did last quarter with hydrogen fuel. Over the years, the company has mostly obtained hydrogen from third parties and sold it to its customers at a huge loss.

This is why it has embarked on building a network of its own hydrogen plants that can produce fuel that it can sell to its customers for a profit.

This is where the DOE loan comes in. In May, the company was given the chance to secure the loan -- if certain conditions to be negotiated by the company and the government are met -- to help it build out its hydrogen plant network. If it is approved, the loan would help fund up to six green hydrogen production facilities.

Plug Power already has two plants up and running, and another is expected to be complete by the end of the year, and that would meet about 65% of where it sees demand headed.

The loan would help create a large plant in Texas scheduled for next year that would meet its customer needs and allow it to expand beyond that.

However, in June, Sen. John Barrasso, a Republican from Wyoming who is the ranking member of the Senate Committee on Energy and Natural Resources, asked the DOE's inspector general to investigate ""any potential impropriety"" by the the DOE’s Loan Programs Office and the loan program's director, Jigar Shah, due to possible conflicts of interest. The senator also questioned Plug Power's viability given its $1.4 billion in losses last year.

Story continues

While Plug Power could pursue financing elsewhere if the loan ultimately does not get approved, the terms and interest rates would undoubtedly be much less favorable. And given the company's financial position and negative operating cash flow, there is no guarantee it would be able to find an institution to lend it the money.

Is the sell-off a buying opportunity?

Plug Power shares shot up as much as 70%, to $4.90, in the day after the DOE loan offer was announced. Today it is trading more than 15% below where it was before the announcement.

If the loan is approved, there should be some immediate upside potential given the past reaction and where the stock now trades. However, that could be short-lived.

Plug Power, meanwhile, has said it is looking to get to gross margin breakeven in its fuel business in the fourth quarter, which would not be dependent on the loan. That is a potential catalyst, but a break-even gross margin is still not a complete solution because it will not make the company profitable or start generating cash.

At this point, I would view Plug Power more like a lottery ticket. If it gets the loan, builds out its plants, and turns positive in gross margin and free cash flow, there could be tremendous upside in the stock. But just like most lottery tickets, there is also the chance it becomes worthless.

Yahoo Finance,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/2-stock-split-ai-stocks-084400291.html,2024-07-01,08:44:00 UTC,"2 Stock-Split AI Stocks to Buy Before They Soar 70% and 230%, According to Certain Wall Street Analysts","Semiconductor company Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA) completed a 10-for-1 stock split in June, and fellow chipmaker Broadcom (NASDAQ: AVGO) has a 10-for-1 stock split planned for July. Savvy investors have gravitated toward both stocks. A company's share price tends to increase about twice as fast as the S&P 500 (SNPINDEX: ^GSPC) during the year following a stock split announcement.

Indeed, certain Wall Street analysts see substantial upside in Nvidia and Broadcom.

Beth Kendig at the I/O Fund expects Nvidia to achieve a $10 trillion market capitalization by 2030. That forecast implies about 230% upside from its current market capitalization of $3 trillion.

Joseph Moore at Morgan Stanley has outlined a bull-case price target that values Broadcom at $2,292 per share by June 2025. That will change to $229.20 per share after the stock split. Either way, that forecast implies 70% upside from its current price of $1,605 per share.

Here's what investors should know about Nvidia and Broadcom.

Nvidia: The market leading in data center GPUs and AI chips

Nvidia graphics processing units (GPUs) are the gold standard in rendering realistic computer graphics and accelerating complex data center workloads like artificial intelligence (AI) applications. Nvidia also provides adjacent data center hardware, such as central processing units (CPUs) and networking equipment, as well as subscription software and services that support graphics and AI workflows.

Nvidia holds more than 95% market share in workstation graphics processors and more than 90% market share in data center GPUs. Additionally, regarding AI specifically, The Wall Street Journal recently reported that ""Nvidia's chips underpin all of the most advanced AI systems, giving the company a market share estimated at more than 80%."" Looking ahead, Nvidia is unlikely to lose its leadership position anytime soon because it has a durable competitive advantage in CUDA.

Nvidia CUDA is a programming model lets GPUs (originally designed for graphics applications) accelerate all sorts of data center computing tasks. The CUDA ecosystem comprises hundreds of software libraries (building blocks) that streamline model training and application development. No other chipmaker has a comparable ecosystem of supporting software. In other words, competitors not only need to overcome the superior performance of Nvidia hardware, but also the immense convenience afforded to developers by Nvidia software.

Nvidia reported blockbuster financial results in the first quarter. Revenue increased 262% to $26 billion and non-GAAP net income soared 461% to $6.12 per diluted share. Nvidia is set to maintain that momentum as the AI market grows. In fact, CFRA analyst Angelo Zino recently said Nvidia ""will be the most important company to our civilization over the next decade.""

Story continues

Additionally, rapid innovation should keep the company ahead of its peers. Nvidia Blackwell GPUs offer four times faster AI training and 30 times faster AI inferencing as compared to the previous Hopper generation. Rosenblatt analyst Han Mosesmann recently said, ""The new Blackwell GPU platform, which ramps up later in 2024, is likely the most ambitious project Silicon Valley has ever witnessed.""

Wall Street expects Nvidia to grow earnings per share at 33% annually over the next three to five years. That makes its current valuation of 68 times adjusted earnings look a little expensive, but not unreasonably so. Investors should be prepared to pay a premium if they want to own this stock.

Personally, I am skeptical about Nvidia achieving a $10 trillion market capitalization by 2030. I certainly believe it's possible, but many things would have to go right for the company. That said, I do believe Nvidia will beat the S&P 500 over the next three to five years, so patient investors should consider buying a small position today.

Broadcom: The market leader in ASICs and networking chips

Broadcom breaks its business into semiconductor solutions and infrastructure software. The company earns semiconductor solutions revenue by developing chips for wired and wireless networking, data center storage, and other end markets. Broadcom also develops application specific integrated circuits (ASICs), chips purpose-built for specialized use cases like artificial intelligence. Additionally, Broadcom earns infrastructure software revenue from cybersecurity, monitoring, and virtualization products.

Broadcom is the leading provider of ASICs with 35% market share, while its closest competitor Marvell Technology holds 12% market share. It is also the leader in networking and wireless chips. That puts Broadcom in a good position because AI adoption is driving demand for ASICs and networking chips. Analysts at Goldman Sachs recently wrote, ""Alongside Nvidia, we view Broadcom as a critical piece to the ongoing AI infrastructure build-out.""

Broadcom reported solid financial results in the second quarter, beating estimates on the top and bottom lines. Revenue surged 43% to $12.5 billion on particularly strong demand for AI chips and virtualization software. Meanwhile, GAAP net income declined 46% to $4.42 per diluted share, but that was due to costs associated with its 2023 acquisition of VMware. Non-GAAP operating income increased 32% during the second quarter.

Broadcom is a hidden gem among AI stocks because Nvidia casts a long shadow. But its strong position in ASICs and networking chips should be a source of momentous revenue growth in the coming years. Indeed, management expects AI chips to account for 25% of its semiconductor solutions revenue in 2025, up from 15% in 2023.

However, Wall Street expects the company to grow earnings per share at 17% annually over the next three to five years. That makes its current valuation of 69 times earnings look expensive, especially when the three-year average is 32 times earnings. To be fair, earnings may grow more quickly than anticipated depending on how the VMware integration progresses. But I plan to avoid the stock until the valuation appears more reasonable. To that end, I see little chance of an 70% return over the next 12 months.

Yahoo Finance,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/3-warren-buffett-stocks-screaming-092100428.html,2024-07-01,09:21:00 UTC,3 Warren Buffett Stocks That Are Screaming Buys for the Second Half of 2024 (and Beyond),"If you've ever wondered why Berkshire Hathaway (NYSE: BRK.A)(NYSE: BRK.B) CEO Warren Buffett draws in the neighborhood of 40,000 investors to his company's shareholder meeting each year, look no further than his track record. Since taking over the CEO role in the mid-1960s, the ""Oracle of Omaha"" has overseen a nearly 4,964,000% return in his company's Class A shares (BRK.A), which compares quite favorably to the roughly 36,000% total return, including dividends paid, for the broad-based S&P 500 over the same span.

For nearly six decades, Buffett and his top-notch investment team have had a knack for picking out time-tested bargains hiding in plain sight.

At the moment, Berkshire has stakes in 44 stocks and two exchange-traded funds spanning $388 billion of invested assets. But among these holdings are three Warren Buffett stocks that represent screaming buys for the second half of 2024, and likely well beyond.

Amazon

The first Warren Buffett stock that stands out for all the right reasons for the second half of 2024 and well beyond is e-commerce leader Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN).

The knock against Amazon has always been its relatively ""expensive"" valuation, at least when using traditional fundamental metrics, such as the price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio. While the time-tested P/E ratio works great when attempting to value mature businesses, this go-to metric tends to come up short when analyzing fast-growing companies that are regularly reinvesting their cash flow back into their operations.

Chances are that you're familiar with Amazon because of its superior e-commerce platform. In 2023, Amazon is estimated to have garnered a nearly 38% share of U.S. online retail sales. While this would, in theory, expose the company to weakness if the U.S. or global economy were to fall into a recession, the important thing to recognize about Amazon is that its operating cash flow and income almost exclusively originate from its faster-growing ancillary operations.

For investors, nothing is more important than Amazon Web Services (AWS). AWS is the world's leading cloud infrastructure service platform, and it recently surpassed $100 billion in annualized run-rate sales. What's noteworthy about this psychological run-rate revenue milestone is that businesses are still in the relatively early stages of ramping up their cloud-service spending. Since cloud-service margins are considerably juicier than the margins associated with online retail sales, AWS is typically responsible for 50% to 100% of Amazon's operating income.

Story continues

Beyond AWS, Amazon is also relying on advertising services and subscription services to do some heavy lifting. Amazon draws around 2.5 billion unique visitors to its site each month, which is more than eyeballs enough to attract advertisers.

Meanwhile, the company surpassed 200 million global Prime subscribers in April 2021 and has likely added to this total as its content library and e-commerce platform have grown. Like AWS, advertising services and subscription services offer sustained double-digit sales growth.

Despite recently hitting a new all-time high, Amazon is historically cheap relative to cash flow projections. Throughout the 2010s, investors regularly paid 23 to 37 times year-end cash flow to own shares of Amazon. You can buy shares right now for about 13 times estimated cash flow per share in 2025.

Chevron

A second no-brainer Warren Buffett stock that's begging to be bought for the second half of 2024 (and beyond) is global energy giant Chevron (NYSE: CVX).

The clearest headwind current and prospective Chevron shareholders have to contend with is the prospect of a recession taking shape in the U.S. or abroad. Oil and gas stocks tend to ebb-and-flow with the spot price of crude oil and natural gas. During periods of economic weakness, it's not uncommon for commodity-driven companies to struggle.

The good news for Chevron is that macro factors are decisively working in its favor. Even with select predictive indicators cautioning of a coming recession -- e.g., the first drop off in U.S. M2 money supply since the Great Depression -- the U.S. economy has remained resilient.

To add to this point, the unprecedented demand uncertainty associated with the COVID-19 pandemic led global energy majors (including Chevron) to scale back their capital expenditures (capex) for a good three years. Even with capex ramping back up, the global supply of crude oil has been constrained. When the supply of an in-demand good is tight, it tends to have a positive effect on the spot price of that good. In simpler terms, it's buoying the price of oil, which in turn is generating more operating cash flow for Chevron's drilling segment.

Perhaps one of the biggest catalysts for the second half of 2024 and into 2025 is Chevron's pending deal to acquire Hess in an all-share transaction valued at $53 billion. If this buyout gets the green light from regulators, Chevron is going to add 465,000 net acres in the oil-rich Bakken Shale, as well as meaningfully increase its oil-equivalent exposure in Guyana. If the price of oil remains elevated, it makes this deal all the sweeter.

Although drilling is where Chevron derives its best margins, don't overlook that it's also an integrated operator. The company's transmission pipelines, refineries, and chemical plants act as a hedge in the event that the spot price of crude oil declines. The steady operating cash flow from these ancillary operating segments has played a key role in Chevron being able to increase its base annual dividend for 37 consecutive years.

The icing on the cake is that Chevron's stock is, also, historically inexpensive. Shares can be grabbed right now for less than 11 times forward-year earnings, which represents a 23% discount to its average forward-year multiple over the trailing-five-year period.

Coca-Cola

The third Warren Buffett stock that's a screaming buy for the second half of 2024, and likely well beyond, is beverage behemoth Coca-Cola (NYSE: KO).

Whereas an economic downturn is arguably the biggest enemy for Amazon and Chevron, the prospect of above-average inflation is typically viewed as the most front-and-center headwind for consumer staples companies. When the price of goods and services is rising at an above-average rate, there's always a concern that consumers may be forced to pare back their spending.

The good news for Coca-Cola is that it provides a basic necessity product. Regardless of what's happening with the U.S. economy or Wall Street, consumers are still going to purchase beverages. Given the company's strong branding, Coca-Cola rarely has any trouble increasing its prices to offset rising expenses.

Speaking of strong branding, Coca-Cola was named the ""most-chosen brand"" by consumers for a 12th straight year in Kantar's latest ""Brand Footprint"" report. This dominance is a reflection of Coca-Cola's top-tier marketing campaign, which involves using digital channels and artificial intelligence (AI) to reach younger audiences, while leaning on more than a century of history and well-known brand ambassadors to connect with its mature consumers.

From an operating perspective, Coca-Cola is firing on all cylinders. Although it's not the growth story it once was, it has the right puzzle pieces in place to deliver consistent mid-single-digit sales and earnings growth. It has more than two dozen brands generating at least $1 billion in annual sales, and is operating in all but three countries (Cuba, North Korea, and Russia). This gives Coca-Cola a steady stream of predictable cash flow in developed countries, and needle-moving organic growth potential in emerging markets.

Coca-Cola is also known for its top-tier capital-return program. In February, the company increased its quarterly dividend by 5.4%, which marked the 62nd consecutive year it's lifted its payout. Berkshire Hathaway is generating a roughly 60% annual yield relative to its cost basis in Coca-Cola stock.

Lastly -- and to stay on theme -- the valuation makes sense. Coca-Cola's forward P/E ratio of 21 is roughly 10% below its average forward-year earnings multiple over the last five years.

Yahoo Finance,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/3-top-dividend-stocks-plan-091800920.html,2024-07-01,09:18:00 UTC,3 Top Dividend Stocks I Plan to Buy Hand Over Fist This July,"I'm a pretty active investor. Cash routinely flows into my brokerage accounts from passive income sources and recurring transfers. I like to immediately put most of the money to work to generate more passive income.

High-quality, high-yielding dividend stocks are my go-to investment. I routinely add to my favorite positions. This month, I plan to continue buying shares of Realty Income (NYSE: O), Brookfield Infrastructure (NYSE: BIPC)(NYSE: BIP), and Enbridge (NYSE: ENB). Here's why I can't seem to get enough of these top-notch income stocks.

The name says it all

Realty Income has a phenomenal record of paying dividends. The diversified REIT has declared 647 consecutive monthly dividends. It has increased its payout 126 times since going public in 1994, including for the past 107 straight quarters, growing its payout at a 4.3% compound annual rate.

I fully expect that steady upward trend in the payout, which at a 6% yield is well above the S&P 500's 1.3% average, to continue. Realty Income's internal growth drivers -- rising rents and using retained cash flow after paying dividends to fund new investments -- should increase its adjusted funds from operations (FFO) by about 2% per share each year. That provides a solid foundation for a steadily rising dividend.

Meanwhile, the company estimates it can add about 0.5% to its FFO per share growth rate for every $1 billion of externally funded acquisitions it makes. Those acquisitions are financed by selling stock and issuing new debt. Realty Income conservatively estimates it can externally fund $4 billion to $6 billion of acquisitions each year. When added to its internal growth drivers, this should push its FFO per share growth rate to about 4% to 5% annually, in line with its historical growth rate. With trillions of dollars in commercial real estate across the U.S. and Europe, Realty Income should have plenty of new investment opportunities.

The high-powered growth should continue

Brookfield Infrastructure has done an excellent job of increasing its dividend. The global infrastructure operator has grown its payout at a 9% compound annual rate since 2009.

It should have plenty of fuel to grow its payout in the future. Brookfield expects a trio of organic drivers -- inflation-indexed rate increases, volume growth as the global economy expands, and expansion projects funded with retained cash flow after paying dividends -- to boost its FFO per share by 6% to 9% annually. The company has a large backlog of expansion projects underway, including several data center developments and two new semiconductor fabrication facilities it's helping finance.

Story continues

On top of organic growth, Brookfield has an excellent record of making accretive acquisitions. It recently agreed to buy an additional 10% interest in its Brazilian integrated rail and logistics provider, and it's working to purchase a portfolio of telecom towers in India. It's funding these deals by recycling capital. Brookfield believes that acquisitions will help drive its FFO growth rate into the double digits. That easily supports its plan to increase its dividend, which yields around 5%, by 5% to 9% per year.

Ample fuel to continue growing

Enbridge has paid dividends to its investors for nearly seven decades. The Canadian pipeline and utility giant has increased its payout every year for the past 29.

The company should have plenty of fuel to continue increasing its dividend, which yields a monster 7.5% these days, for the next several years. It's in the process of closing a once-in-a-generation acquisition of three high-quality gas utilities in the United States. That deal will immediately boost its earnings, enhance its diversification and income stability, and add to its growth profile.

In addition, the company has a robust organic growth backlog. It has billions of dollars in commercially secured projects under construction that should come online through 2028. These projects should help grow its cash flow per share by 3% annually through 2026 and by a roughly 5% per year pace after that. That visible earnings growth, along with its top-notch financial profile, positions Enbridge to continue increasing its dividend each year.

High-quality income stocks

Realty Income, Brookfield Infrastructure, and Enbridge are my ideal income stocks. They pay well above-average dividends, and those payouts should continue rising steadily in the future. Those factors are driving my decision to continue buying these top-notch income stocks hand over fist in July.

Yahoo Finance,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/better-hydrogen-stock-plug-power-082000323.html,2024-06-30,08:20:00 UTC,Better Hydrogen Stock: Plug Power vs. Nikola,"Plug Power (NASDAQ: PLUG) and Nikola (NASDAQ: NKLA) represent two different ways to invest in the nascent hydrogen power market. Plug Power sells hydrogen fuel systems for electric forklifts and other warehouse equipment, while Nikola develops semitrailer trucks that run on electric batteries and hydrogen fuel cells.

Both stocks initially attracted a stampede of bulls. Plug Power went public at a reverse split-adjusted IPO price of $150 in October 1999, and its stock skyrocketed to a record high of $1,498 during the peak of the dot-com bubble.

Nikola went public by merging with a special purpose acquisition company (SPAC) in June 2020, and its stock opened at a reverse split-adjusted price of $1,126.50 on the first day before hitting its all-time high of $2,391.90 over the following week.

Image source: Nikola.

But today, Plug Power and Nikola only trade at about $2 and $10, respectively. Let's see why these hydrogen stocks ran out of fuel -- and which one could be the better turnaround play.

Plug Power still has a lot to prove

Plug Power has severe customer concentration issues. It generates most of its revenue by selling its fuel systems to Amazon and Walmart. But to lock in those two big customers, it granted them stock warrants (options to buy more shares of the company at a discount) to subsidize the fuel cells they bought.

That loss-leading strategy caused it to report a negative net revenue of $93 million in 2020 as the costs of funding those incentives offset its customer payments. Plug's revenue turned positive again in 2021 and subsequently rose 40% in 2022 and 27% in 2023, but its operating margins consistently withered as its net losses widened.

Metric 2021 2022 2023 Revenue $502 million $701 million $891 million Operating margin (87%) (97%) (151%) Net income (loss) ($460 million) ($724 million) ($1.37 billion)

Data source: Plug Power.

To make matters worse, it delayed the filing of its annual report for 2020 and had to restate all of its financials for 2018 and 2019. Those blunders, along with the market's waning interest in renewable energy stocks, drove away the bulls.

For 2024, analysts expect Plug Power's revenue to only rise 4% to $926 million, its operating margin to improve to negative 89%, and its net loss to narrow to $826 million. It mainly attributes that slowdown to the macro headwinds, which are driving its top customers to dial back their big hydrogen fuel cell upgrades.

The company ended the first quarter of 2024 with only $173 million in cash and equivalents, but it recently secured a new $1.66 billion loan from the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) to build up to six green hydrogen production facilities. That lifeline should buy it a bit more time to scale up its business, but it hasn't proven that its business model is sustainable yet.

Story continues

Nikola overpromised and underdelivered

Nikola only delivered 79 battery-powered semitrailer trucks (BEVs) and 35 hydrogen fuel cell-powered semitrailer trucks (FCEVs) in 2023. That was well below the original target of 3,500 BEVs and 2,000 FCEVs which it set during its pre-merger presentation. It also recalled nearly all of its BEVs last year after a series of widely publicized battery fires. Nikola originally aimed to generate $1.4 billion in revenue in 2023 but fell far short of that.

Metric 2021 2022 2023 Revenue $0 $51 million $36 million Operating margin N/A (1,378%) (1,806%) Net income (loss) ($690 million) ($784 million) ($966 million)

Data source: Nikola.

Nikola's founder and former CEO Trevor Milton was also convicted of securities and wire fraud in 2022.

The current CEO, Steve Girsky, claims the company can scale up its business and generate ""$150 million to $170 million"" in total truck revenue in 2024. Analysts expect it to generate $126 million in revenue, with a net loss of $496 million for the full year.

That's a grim outlook for a company that only had $346 million in cash and equivalents at the end of the first quarter of 2024. It's also constantly diluting its existing investors with new share offerings to raise more cash. Over the past three years, Nikola increased its share count by a whopping 242% as Plug Power's share count rose 30%.

Nikola believes it can overcome its growing pains, ramp up its production, and build more hydrogen charging stations with its partner Voltera to support its FCEVs. But just like Plug Power, there's no clear indication that its business model can survive over the long term. Its BEVs could also face fierce competition from Tesla's new Semi model.

The better buy: Plug Power

Plug Power and Nikola both look historically cheap at 2 and 4 times this year's sales, respectively. I personally wouldn't touch either of these stocks until more green shoots appear, but Plug Power's higher revenue, DOE lifeline, and lower valuations make it a more compelling turnaround play than Nikola right now.

Yahoo Finance,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/a-fintech-collapse-is-rippling-through-a-small-corner-of-the-banking-world-143054499.html,2024-06-30,14:30:54 UTC,A fintech collapse is rippling through a small corner of the banking world,"The unraveling of fintech upstart Synapse is rippling through a small corner of the banking world, leaving thousands of customers without access to their money and a mystery about millions of dollars that went missing.

Four small US banks have some of the money. No one is sure where the rest went.

The saga surrounding the bankruptcy of Synapse, a 10-year-old fintech firm, puts a new spotlight on how loose webs of partnerships between venture-backed upstarts and FDIC-backed lenders can go so wrong.

Regulators are more closely scrutinizing these relationships and warning various banks to tighten their controls when working with fintech firms.

Earlier this month, the Federal Reserve slapped one of Synapse’s partner banks with an enforcement action that identified risk management weaknesses surrounding such partnerships.

'Banking as a service'

Synapse was part of a wave of new fintech firms that emerged in the aftermath of the 2008 financial crisis as Silicon Valley-style digital banking upstarts promised to shake up the world of traditional finance.

In just a decade it became a major middleman between dozens of fintech companies and community banks by offering what it called ""banking as a service.""

It provided digital banking outfits like Mercury, Dave (DAVE), and Juno with access to checking accounts and debit cards they could offer their customers. It was able to do this by partnering with FDIC-backed banks that in return got a new source of deposits and fee revenue.

The traditional lenders that partnered with Synapse included Evolve Bank & Trust, American Bank, AMG National Trust, and Lineage Bank, all small banks when compared with giants like JPMorgan Chase (JPM) or Bank of America (BAC).

The largest was Evolve, which had roughly $1.5 billion in assets at the end of the first quarter.

The pitch that Synapse effectively gave to these smaller banks was ""we’ll bring in the deposits; you don’t have to do much,"" according to Jason Mikula, an independent fintech consultant who publishes a weekly newsletter and has followed Synapse.

""This turned out not to be accurate, in my opinion,"" Mikula added.

The problems surfaced shortly after Synapse filed for bankruptcy in April when it could not reach an agreement with Evolve on a settlement of funds.

Three weeks into the bankruptcy proceedings, Synapse cut off Evolve's access to its technology system. That, in turn, forced Evolve and the other partner banks to freeze customer accounts.

Both parties blamed each other as the culprit.

""Synapse’s abrupt shutdown of essential systems without notice and failure to provide necessary records needlessly jeopardized end users by hindering our ability to verify transactions, confirm end user balances, and comply with applicable law,"" Evolve said in a statement.

Story continues

Synapse CEO Sankaet Pathak rebuked this claim, accusing Evolve of having the means to settle a deficit yet delaying the return of customer funds.

""The debtor has been forced to play a perverse game of 'whack-a-mole' with unreasonable demands from Evolve as conditions to unfreezing the depositor accounts, all while the depositors suffer lack of access to their funds,"" Pathak stated in court documents last month.

The end result is that thousands of fintech customers lost access to their money.

“Synapse’s bankruptcy has left tens of thousands of end-users of financial technology platforms that were customers of Synapse stranded without access to their funds,” Jelena McWilliams, the court-appointed trustee to Synapse and a former FDIC chair, wrote in a letter last week to the heads of five federal banking regulators.

There was another problem: No one seemed to know where all of the money was.

McWilliams in early June said there was a shortfall of $85 million, with the four banks only accounting for $180 million of the $265 million belonging to end users.

More recently she said the range of the shortfall was $65 million to $96 million.

Some money has been paid back to customers. McWilliams said on June 21 that more than $100 million ""has been distributed by certain of the partner banks.""

Blind spots

Bank regulators have been concerned for some time about the partnerships between Silicon Valley-style digital startups and FDIC-backed banks.

Acting Comptroller of the Currency Michael Hsu used a September 2023 speech to discuss the potential blind spots for regulators as these relationships become more blurry.

“Banks and tech firms, in an effort to provide a ‘seamless’ customer experience, are teaming up in ways that make it more difficult for customers, regulators, and the industry to distinguish between where the bank stops and where the tech firm starts,” Hsu said in the speech.

Last June, regulators issued final joint guidance on how lenders should handle these relationships.

These partnerships are not yet widespread across the entire banking industry, even though the use of this model is accelerating while banks of all sizes seek ways to attract deposits and earn more revenue.

Fewer than 2% of US banks used the banking-as-a-service model in 2023, according to S&P Global Market Intelligence.

But regulators are nonetheless getting more aggressive about calling out such relationships. The banking-as-a-service model accounted for 13.5% of public enforcement actions from regulators in 2023, according to S&P.

In January, the FDIC issued a consent order to one of Synapse’s partner banks, Franklin, Tenn.-based Lineage, that identified weaknesses related to its banking-as-a-service program and ordered the bank to come up with a plan for how to achieve an ""orderly termination"" with significant fintech partners.

The next month, New York City-based Piermont Bank; Attica, Ohio-based Sutton Bank; and Martinsville, Va.-based Blue Ridge Bank received consent orders from regulators related to alleged deficiencies in their banking-as-a-service business.

Then, earlier this month, the Fed issued an enforcement action against Evolve, saying that examinations conducted in 2023 ""found that Evolve engaged in unsafe and unsound banking practices by failing to have in place an effective risk management framework"" for its partnerships with fintech companies.

Regulators asked Evolve to improve its policies and risk management practices ""by implementing appropriate oversight and monitoring of those relationships."" They also noted that the action was ""independent of the bankruptcy proceedings regarding Synapse.""

A spokesperson for Evolve said the recent order was ""similar to orders received by others in the industry"" and ""does not affect our existing business, customers, or deposits.""

The bank counts Affirm (AFRM), Mastercard (MA), and Stripe as notable fintech partnerships on its website.

It has also in the past partnered with two crypto firms that went bankrupt, FTX and BlockFi, as well as Bytechip, a financial services firm had its accounts with Evolve frozen late last year on the allegation it violated federal law by laundering money for fraudsters.

To add to its recent challenges, Evolve said this past Wednesday that some customer data was illegally spread on the dark web as a result of ""a cybersecurity incident involving a known cybercriminal organization.""

""Evolve has engaged the appropriate law enforcement authorities to aid in our investigation and response efforts,"" the bank said. ""This incident has been contained, and there is no ongoing threat.""

Yahoo Finance,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/sizzling-summer-3-top-dividend-125300260.html,2024-06-30,12:53:00 UTC,Sizzling Summer: 3 Top Dividend Stocks to Buy to Cash in on Red-Hot Power Demand,"A heat wave has gripped much of the country this summer. That has people cranking up their ACs to cool down, which is boosting power demand. The rise in power consumption and prices will likely raise the average power bill by about 3% this year compared to last summer.

The current heat isn't the only factor driving up power demand. The increasing electrification of the transportation sector, growth in power-hungry data centers (especially for AI), and other catalysts have the country on track to see a surge in power demand through the end of the decade.

Instead of sweating the heat wave (and rising future power prices), you can cash in on red-hot demand for power. Dominion Energy (NYSE: D), NextEra Energy (NYSE: NEE), and Duke Energy (NYSE: DUK) stand out to a few Fool.com contributors as great ways to potentially generate lots of dividend income from growing power demand.

Dominion Energy is a high-yield work-in-progress

Reuben Gregg Brewer (Dominion Energy): To get the bad news out up front, Dominion Energy's dividend won't be growing for a few years. That's because the company has just completed a corporate overhaul that includes selling natural gas utility assets so that it can focus on its electric utility business. Also in this mix is the goal of shoring up the company's balance sheet and reducing its payout ratio to be more in line with peers.

Thus, no dividend growth for now. But you will be paid very well to wait for Dominion's dividend to start growing again via the stock's attractive 5.4% dividend yield. That's well above the utility average of around 3%. However, the real attraction here is the markets Dominion serves in the Southeastern United States, which includes one of the world's fastest-growing data center markets.

To put some numbers on this, Dominion added 94 data centers to the grid over the past five years and expects to add another 15 in 2024. And there will be more to come in the future. Data centers use a tremendous amount of electricity and support the long-term demand growth that will help Dominion get its capital spending plans and rate requests approved by regulators.

Longer term, Dominion is projecting earnings growth of between 5% and 7%. And once the company has solidified its finances, dividend growth will likely resume and track earnings growth. So, you get a high yield today and a growing dividend tomorrow.

Cashing in on the summer's Sun

Matt DiLallo (NextEra Energy): NextEra Energy has multiple ways to cash in on rising power demand. The company operates the country's largest electric utility (Florida Power & Light, or FPL), which provides electricity to about 5.9 million customers in Florida. It also owns one of the world's biggest clean energy businesses (NextEra Energy Resources), which supplies electricity to other utilities and large corporate buyers.

Story continues

FPL benefits from higher electricity demand when customers crank up the AC on hot summer days. It also benefits from its ability to harness the Sun's power to produce electricity. Last quarter alone, it added more than 1.6 gigawatts (GW) of new, cost-effective solar energy. FPL now owns and operates 6.4 GW of solar, the largest utility-scale solar portfolio in the country. The utility's low-cost solar operations are one reason its customers don't sweat heatwaves (their bills are 37% below the national average).

NextEra's energy resources segment is well-positioned to meet the country's growing demand for power. While it primarily sells electricity under long-term, fixed-rate power purchase agreements, rising prices will enable it to lock in higher rates as legacy contracts expire. Growing power demand also enables NextEra to build more renewable energy capacity.

The company expects strong, rising power demand to drive 6% to 8% adjusted earnings-per-share growth through 2027. That should give it the fuel to increase its dividend, which it has done every year for three decades. It currently expects to grow its payout by around 10% annually through at least 2026. That's a robust growth rate for a payout that already yields an above-average 2.8% (more than double the S&P 500's 1.3 % yield).

Duke Energy has the power to potentially generate strong returns

Neha Chamaria (Duke Energy): Duke Energy is among the largest electric utilities in the U.S., with a customer base of nearly 8.2 million across six states. Importantly, some of these are among the fastest-growing states in the U.S., including Florida, North Carolina, and South Carolina. Florida and South Carolina were, in fact, the two fastest-growing states in the U.S. in 2023, clocking 1.6% and 1.7% growth, respectively, according to the U.S. Census Bureau.

Duke Energy projects 1.5% to 2% annual growth across all its jurisdictions between 2023 and 2028, driven by economic growth led by high-potential industries like artificial intelligence, chip manufacturing, data centers, electric vehicles, automakers, and pharmaceuticals. Florida and the Carolinas were also among the leading states in terms of migration last year, which partly explains why Duke Energy added 195,000 new customers in 2023, also its largest ever.

Duke Energy's profile alone, therefore, positions it well to benefit from a potential surge in power demand. The company isn't resting on its laurels, though -- it plans to invest a whopping $73 billion to expand and modernize its infrastructure through 2028 to grow its rate base steadily. The utility expects its investments to boost adjusted earnings per share by 5% to 7% through 2028, which should also support dividend growth.

The stock yields 4% today, and the utility believes it should be able to maintain its yield in the coming years. Overall, that makes Duke Energy a compelling stock to buy if you want to cash in on rising power demand.

(Reuters) - U.S. stock index futures gained on Monday ahead of manufacturing PMI data, with focus also on labor market numbers later in the week for cues on the Federal Reserve's monetary policy path.

AI chip firm Nvidia (NASDAQ: ) shed 1.0% in premarket trading, after choppy trade last week, along with some weakness in other semiconductor stocks. Megacaps such as Alphabet (NASDAQ: ), Microsoft (NASDAQ: ) and Amazon.com (NASDAQ: ) were up between 0.4% and 0.9%.

Focus will be on ISM and S&P Global manufacturing PMIs later in the day. This follows Friday's personal consumption expenditures (PCE) price index, the Fed's preferred measure of inflation, which was unchanged in May and underscored the narrative of slowing inflation and resilient economic growth.

Also scheduled for the week are JOLTS job openings data on Tuesday, and ADP employment, factory orders, ISM services PMI data and minutes of the Fed's latest policy meeting on Wednesday.

Non-farm payrolls data is due on Thursday, when trading will be shut for equities on account of U.S. Independence Day.

Traders have largely stuck to their bets of around two interest rate cuts this year, starting from September, according to LSEG FedWatch.

Comments from New York Fed President John Williams are also due later on Monday.

The Nasdaq and the benchmark notched their third straight quarterly gains on Friday, with the tech-heavy index doing so for the first time in three years.

""It's half time, and it is definitely party time, at least if you are in a large-cap, market-weighted index or the Magnificent Seven,"" wrote Howard Silverblatt, senior index analyst at S&P Dow Jones Indices.

""The market continued to have no problem with a delaying Fed, geopolitical issues or the pending U.S. election ... July should be dominated by earnings and, more importantly, projections for the second half of 2024.""

As the top few heavily weighted stocks have largely supported Wall Street's upward trajectory on optimism around artificial intelligence and interest rate cuts, the blue-chip Dow has lagged its peers with a quarterly decline.

Owing to the lack of broad-based gains, market participants have highlighted concerns over the sustenance of such a skewed rally, calling for the need of greater diversification in investor holdings.

The firm's stance comes after a period of heightened investor interest in Sarepta following the expanded FDA approval of its drug Elevidys on June 20th.

The drug's launch dynamics have been closely watched, especially as Sarepta's shares saw an approximate 8% decline since the FDA's decision. This movement is attributed to the market's focus on the sales trajectory that the drug's broader label might influence.

Piper Sandler noted that the recent retracement in Sarepta's share price reflects investor sentiment tied to the sales expectations of Elevidys under its new, expanded label.

The firm's confidence in the stock is supported by the perceived strong interest in Elevidys from both ambulatory and non-ambulatory patients. This interest was evident during the Parent Project Muscular Dystrophy (PPMD) Annual Meeting, which Piper Sandler attended virtually.

The meeting brought together key experts and families affected by Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy (DMD) to discuss the latest developments in the treatment of the disease.

The firm highlighted the discussions from the PPMD Annual Meeting, which focused on the significant anticipation for Elevidys among the DMD community. Experts at the meeting also addressed the necessary steps that treatment sites should take to ensure equitable access to the drug. The attention to Elevidys' distribution and accessibility indicates a proactive approach to its integration into the DMD treatment landscape.

Piper Sandler's reiteration of the Overweight rating suggests a continued positive outlook for Sarepta Therapeutics. The firm's analysis appears to be grounded in recent developments and feedback from the DMD community, which may play a crucial role in the drug's commercial success.

The maintained price target of $205.00 by Piper Sandler reflects the firm's assessment of Sarepta's market potential, despite the recent fluctuation in its stock price post-FDA approval. The ongoing interest from investors and the medical community alike seems to contribute to a stable view of the company's prospects in the near term.

In other recent news, Sarepta Therapeutics has experienced significant developments regarding its drug Elevidys. The FDA granted an expanded approval to Elevidys, enabling it to treat both ambulatory and non-ambulatory Duchenne muscular dystrophy patients aged four and older.

This approval has led to a series of revisions and raised price targets for Sarepta by various firms. BMO Capital maintained an Outperform rating, while Citi downgraded Sarepta's shares from Buy to Neutral but raised the price target to $176.

Mizuho Securities increased its price target to $200, and BofA Securities raised its price target to $213. Baird also lifted its price target to $200, following the FDA's endorsement of the drug's safety and efficacy.

Sarepta is also in partnership with Roche for the global distribution of Elevidys, further emphasizing the company's growth trajectory. These recent developments underscore the significance of Elevidys' expanded approval and its potential impact on Sarepta's future revenue prospects.

The firm's focus was on Boeing's proposed acquisition of SPR, which includes a notable $559 million payment to Airbus.

The deal, valued at $8.9 billion, is equivalent to 26 times the estimated 2026 free cash flow before accounting for synergies. It is expected to increase Boeing's share count by approximately 4%.

TD Cowen highlighted the acquisition as a strategic decision that could lead to significant productivity enhancements for Boeing, provided the integration is managed effectively. Despite this optimism, there is an acknowledgment that Boeing investors might feel let down because the payment to Airbus surpassed initial expectations.

The acquisition is set to bring about a shift in Boeing's operational dynamics, potentially impacting its future financial performance. The analyst at TD Cowen underscored the importance of execution in realizing the anticipated productivity gains from the deal. This transaction is a critical step for Boeing as it aims to strengthen its market position and enhance its production capabilities.

The financial details of the transaction reveal a significant investment by Boeing into SPR, and the sizable payment to Airbus is a prominent aspect of this deal. The analyst's reiteration of the Buy rating and price target suggests confidence in Boeing's strategy and its potential to yield positive outcomes.

As the acquisition progresses, Boeing's management and stakeholders will be closely monitoring the implementation of the new strategic measures. The company's ability to integrate SPR successfully and capitalize on the expected productivity improvements will be crucial in determining the long-term benefits of this acquisition.

Investors and market watchers will likely continue to evaluate Boeing's financial health and strategic decisions, such as this acquisition, to gauge the company's trajectory in the competitive aerospace industry.

In other recent news, Airbus and Boeing have both announced strategic acquisitions of Spirit AeroSystems (NYSE: ) units. Airbus is set to acquire operations currently incurring losses, including four Spirit plants located in the United States, Northern Ireland, France, and Morocco.

As part of the agreement, Airbus will receive compensation of $559 million from Spirit AeroSystems and will pay a nominal fee of $1 for the assets, contingent upon the final deal structure. These recent developments are part of a broader divestiture by Spirit AeroSystems.

On the other hand, Boeing has revealed its plans to acquire Spirit AeroSystems in an all-stock transaction valued at $4.7 billion, which increases to approximately $8.3 billion when considering Spirit's reported net debt.

This move aims to consolidate Boeing's supply chain amid industry challenges. The deal also includes Spirit shareholders receiving 0.25 shares of Boeing for each share they hold.

These acquisitions are anticipated to reshape the aerospace industry, with Airbus and Boeing securing key components for their aircraft production and strengthening their respective supply chains.

The finalization of both deals is pending due diligence. The aerospace industry will be closely watching as the deals progress and as Airbus and Boeing integrate Spirit's operations into their business models.

InvestingPro Insights

In light of Boeing's recent acquisition of SPR and the subsequent financial implications, it's pertinent to consider some key metrics and insights from InvestingPro. SPR's current market capitalization stands at approximately $3.83 billion, reflecting the size of the business Boeing is integrating. Despite a notable revenue growth of 19.54% over the last twelve months as of Q1 2024, SPR is grappling with a negative gross profit margin of -3.62%, which indicates challenges in maintaining profitability.

InvestingPro Tips highlight that SPR operates with a significant debt burden and may have trouble making interest payments on its debt. Additionally, analysts have revised their earnings downwards for the upcoming period, suggesting that the market is cautious about SPR's ability to generate profits in the near term. For investors considering the impact of this acquisition on Boeing's future, these factors are crucial to monitor. On the upside, SPR's liquid assets exceed its short-term obligations, providing some financial flexibility.

Markets were on edge over a potential, major liquidation event with the now defunct exchange Mt Gox set to begin distributions of stolen tokens from this week.

Anticipation of more cues on U.S. interest rates, from the Federal Reserve and from economic data, also kept sentiment on edge.

Mt Gox Bitcoin distribution set to begin

The liquidators of Mt Gox said they will begin distributing Bitcoin stolen during a 2014 hack from early July.

Traders speculated that receivers of the stolen tokens will be largely inclined to sell, given that Bitcoin saw a massive spike in valuation over the past decade.

Such an event presents massive selling pressure on Bitcoin, and could spark substantial price losses. The token saw steep losses in late-June on this notion.

Crypto investment products also logged two straight weeks of outflows amid fears of selling pressure on Bitcoin.

Crypto price today: Altcoins rise with rate jitters in play

Among broader crypto markets, altcoin prices rose on Monday, recovering a measure of steep losses from June.

Bitcoin could face selling pressure at $65K, per on-chain data

Bitcoin could face resistance around the $65,000 level, on-chain data suggests.

The leading cryptocurrency is attempting to bounce back after ending June with a 7% decline, a drop that reversed May's gains primarily due to miner selling and concerns over ETF inflows being non-directional arbitrage bets rather than outright bullish investments.

The recent decline has pushed Bitcoin prices below the aggregate cost basis of short-term holders—wallets that have held BTC for 155 days or less. According to LookIntoBitcoin, this aggregate cost basis is now at $65,000.

On-chain analytics firms use realized price as the aggregate cost basis, reflecting the average price at which coins were last moved on-chain.

In practical terms, this means short-term holders are now facing losses or holding positions in the red, which may lead them to sell at a loss or breakeven, potentially adding selling pressure around the $65,000 mark.

""The price of Bitcoin has fallen below the aggregate cost basis of short-term holders for the first time since August 2023. In the short term, we should expect some resistance around the ~$65,000 level as short-term market speculators may look to exit their positions at a 'breakeven' level,"" analysts at Blockware Intelligence said in a note seen by CoinDesk.

The firm anticipates the company to report a quarter that aligns with expectations, with revenue estimates slightly above consensus and earnings per share (EPS) expected to be on par. APi Group's guidance for the third quarter of 2024 is predicted to match or be close to current estimates, and the firm is likely to reiterate its full-year 2024 guidance.

APi Group is poised to capitalize on growth in several key industries, including data centers, semiconductor manufacturing, electric vehicle (EV) production, healthcare, and critical infrastructure.

These sectors are expected to drive the company's performance despite previous challenges related to customer and project selection, which are now believed to be diminishing.

The company's EBITDA margins are forecasted to surpass the 13% target by the fiscal year 2025, thanks to the integration of Chubb (NYSE: ), which is expected to contribute to value creation.

Additionally, APi Group's disciplined pricing strategies, enhancements in inspection services, and the recent acquisition of Elevated Services are all contributing factors to this positive margin outlook.

This improved margin is also anticipated to enhance the company's free cash flow (FCF) conversion, indicating a stronger financial position moving forward. RBC Capital's outlook suggests confidence in APi Group's strategic initiatives and its ability to navigate through industry headwinds to achieve sustainable growth and profitability.

In other recent news, APi Group Corporation has seen significant developments. The company recently completed the acquisition of Elevated Facility Services Group for approximately $570 million, a strategic move that is expected to significantly enhance APi's service offerings in the elevator and escalator sector. This acquisition is anticipated to contribute an estimated $220 million in annual revenue, expanding APi's operational footprint to over 18 states.

Additionally, APi Group has updated its full-year guidance for 2024. The company now anticipates net revenues to range between $7,150 and $7,350 million, a rise from the previous forecast of $7,050 to $7,250 million. Adjusted EBITDA expectations have also been raised to $875 to $925 million, up from $855 to $905 million.

Further, APi Group reported its first quarter 2024 financial results, displaying steady performance with a record adjusted EBITDA margin of 10.9%. The company also highlighted a 3% organic growth in service revenues and a significant increase in core inspection revenues in its Life Safety business.

In analyst news, Jefferies has maintained a Buy rating and increased the price target for APi Group to $50, reflecting the completion of the Elevated acquisition. Similarly, Baird has raised the company's share price target to $43.00, citing progress towards its margin goals. These are recent developments in the company's business strategy and financial performance.

Investing.com,https://www.investing.com/news/press-releases/brw-announces-0085-dividend-93CH-3503524,2024-07-01,11:00:08 UTC,BRW Announces $0.085 Dividend By Investing.com,"NEW YORK--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Saba Capital Income & Opportunities Fund (NYSE: BRW) (the Fund), a registered closed-end management investment company listed on the New York Stock Exchange, declared a monthly dividend of $0.085 per share on June 28, 2024, payable on July 31, 2024 to shareholders of record as of July 9, 2024.

Managed Distribution Plan. The above distribution was declared in accordance with the Fund's currently effective managed distribution plan (the Plan), whereby the Fund will make monthly distributions to shareholders at a fixed amount of $0.085 per share. Thus, the distribution amount shown excludes special dividends (which are not paid pursuant to the plan), including the special dividend paid during the current fiscal period in January 2024. The Fund will generally distribute amounts necessary to satisfy the Fund's Plan and the requirements prescribed by excise tax rules and Subchapter M of the Internal Revenue Code. The Plan is intended to provide shareholders with a constant, but not guaranteed, fixed minimum rate of distribution each month and is intended to narrow the discount between the market price and the net asset value of the Fund's common shares, but there is no assurance that the Plan will be successful in doing so.

Under the Plan, to the extent that sufficient investment income is not available on a monthly basis, the Fund will distribute long-term capital gains and/or return of capital in order to maintain its managed distribution rate. As a result, long-term capital gains and/or return of capital may be a material source of any distribution. No conclusions should be drawn about the Fund's investment performance from the amount of the Fund's distributions or from the terms of the Fund's Plan. The Board of Trustees (the Board) may amend the terms of the Plan or terminate the Plan at any time without prior notice to Fund shareholders. No level of distribution can be guaranteed. The amendment or termination of the Plan could have an adverse effect on the market price of the Fund's common shares. The Plan is subject to the periodic review by the Board, including a yearly review of the annual minimum fixed rate to determine if an adjustment should be made.

In compliance with Rule 19a-1 of the Investment Company Act of 1940, shareholders will receive a notice that details the source of income for the above dividend, such as net investment income, gain from the sale of securities and return of principal; however, determination of the actual source of the foregoing dividend can only be made at year-end. The actual source amounts of all Fund dividends will be included in the Fund's annual or semiannual reports. In addition, the tax treatment may differ from the accounting treatment used to calculate the source of the Fund's dividends as shown on shareholders' statements. Shareholders should refer to their Form 1099-DIV for the character and amount of distributions for income tax reporting purposes. Since each shareholder's tax situation is unique, it may be advisable to consult a tax advisor as to the appropriate treatment of Fund distributions.

Past Performance is No Assurance of Future Results. Investment return and principal value of an investment in the Fund will fluctuate. Shares, when sold, may be worth more or less than their original cost. Investors should consider the investment objective, risks and expenses carefully. You can obtain the Fund's most recent periodic reports and filings by visiting https://www.sec.gov/edgar/browse/?CIK=826020&owner=exclude.

Certain Risk Factors: The Fund's investment objective is to provide investors with high current income, with a secondary goal of capital appreciation. There can be no assurance that the Fund will meet its investment objective. The Fund seeks to achieve this objective by investing globally in debt and equity securities of public and private companies, which includes, among other things, investments in closed-end funds, special purpose acquisition companies (SPACs), reinsurance, and public and private debt instruments. The Fund also may utilize derivatives including but not limited to total return swaps, credit default swaps, options (including but not limited to index options) and futures, in seeking to enhance returns and/or to reduce portfolio risk. In addition, on an opportunistic basis, the Fund may also invest up to 15% of its total assets in private funds that focus on debt, equity or other investments consistent with the Fund's investment objective.

The value of equity securities of public and private, listed and unlisted companies and equity derivatives generally varies with the performance of the issuer and movements in the equity markets more generally. As a result, the Fund may suffer losses if it invests in equity instruments of issuers whose performance diverges from the Fund's investment manager's expectations or if equity markets generally move in a single direction and the Fund has not hedged against such a general move. The Fund may invest in closed-end funds and SPACs, which are subject to additional risks and considerations. The performance of reinsurance-related securities and the reinsurance industry itself are tied to the occurrence of various triggering events, including but not limited to weather, natural disasters (hurricanes, earthquakes, etc.), non-natural large catastrophes and other specified events causing physical and/or economic loss. To the extent the Fund invests in reinsurance-related securities for which a triggering event occurs, losses associated with such event could result in losses to the Fund's investment, and a series of major triggering events affecting a large portion of the reinsurance-related securities held by the Fund could result in substantial losses to the Fund's investment. The Fund may invest in high yield securities, which are speculative in nature and are subject to additional risk factors such as increased possibility of default, illiquidity of the security, and changes in value based on changes in interest rates. Changes in short-term market interest rates may directly affect the yield on the Fund's common shares. If such rates fall, the Fund's yield may also fall. If interest rate spreads on bonds and loans owned by the Fund decline in general, the yield on the bonds and loans will likely fall and the value of such bonds and loans may decrease. When short-term market interest rates rise, because of the lag between changes in such short-term rates and the resetting of the floating rates on bonds and loans in the Fund's portfolio, the impact of rising rates will be delayed to the extent of such lag. Because of the limited secondary market for certain bonds and loans, the Fund's ability to sell such securities in a timely fashion and/or at a favorable price may be limited. An increase in the demand for bonds and loans may adversely affect the rate of interest payable on new bonds and loans acquired by the Fund, and it may also increase the price of bonds and loans purchased by the Fund in the secondary market. A decrease in the demand for bonds and loans may adversely affect the price of bonds and loans in the Fund's portfolio, which would cause the Fund's net asset value to decrease. The Fund's use of leverage, if any, through borrowings or issuance of preferred shares can adversely affect the yield on the Fund's common shares. Investment in foreign borrowers involves special risks, including but not limited to potentially less rigorous accounting requirements, differing legal systems and potential political, social and economic adversity. The Fund may engage in currency exchange transactions to seek to hedge, as closely as practicable, all of the economic impact to the Fund arising from foreign currency fluctuations. Other risks include, but are not limited to, the use of derivatives, the potential lack of diversification in the Fund's portfolio, and the fact that the Fund's portfolio may be concentrated in a small group of industries or industry sectors from time to time. Investors should consult the Fund's filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission as well as the materials on the Fund's website for a more detailed discussion of these or other risk factors that affect the Fund.

NEW YORK--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Rubicon Technologies, Inc. (Rubicon or the Company) (OTC: RBTC), a leading provider of technology-based waste and recycling solutions, today announced that Phil Rodoni will be stepping down as CEO of Rubicon and as a member of the Company's Board of Directors (the Board), effective immediately.

Rubicon has made tremendous strides in multiple areas of the business since our public listing, and I am enthusiastic about the value creation opportunity that stands in front of us. I am grateful to the Board for putting its trust in me during this period of transition.

In conjunction with his appointment, Ahmed has stepped down from the Board's Audit Committee and as lead independent director but will remain as a member of the Board.

Rodoni has served as Rubicon's CEO since 2022. Prior to that, he served as the Company's chief technology officer between 2015-2022. He came to Rubicon from Esurance, where he held the role of vice president of software development.

It has been a pleasure leading Rubicon, said Rodoni. We have come a long way as an organization, and I remain excited for the Company's future under its new leadership.

In May, Rubicon announced the sale of its fleet technology business unit in a deal that includes up-front cash of $61.7 million and an earnout consideration of $12.5 million that could become payable in 2024. This strategic move underscores Rubicon's dedication to the RUBICONConnect™ product, which serves commercial waste generators from small to medium-sized businesses to Fortune 500 companies. Many of the Company's commercial customers are looking to Rubicon to help them achieve sustainability goals with tailored zero waste and circular economy solutions, including through the Company's Technical Advisory Services (TAS).

HIE: CUSIP“600379 101

Declaration Ex-Date Record Payable July 1, 2024 July 24, 2024 July 24, 2024 July 31, 2024 July 1, 2024 August 23, 2024 August 23, 2024 August 30, 2024 July 1, 2024 September 23, 2024 September 23, 2024 September 30, 2024

The Fund's current indicated distribution rate based on its closing price on the New York Stock Exchange on June 28, 2024 ($11.21) is 5.46%. The current indicated rate based on the Fund's net asset value per share ($11.56) is 5.29%. The Fund intends to pay monthly distributions to its shareholders.

Each quarter, the Board of Trustees reviews the Adviser's recommended amount of any potential distribution to shareholders. The Board of Trustees will monitor the Fund's distribution level. The Fund's distribution rate may be affected by numerous factors, including changes in realized and projected market returns, Fund performance and other factors. There can be no assurance that an unanticipated change in market conditions or other unforeseen factors will not result in a change in the Fund's distribution rate at a future time. The distribution rate should not be considered the dividend yield or total return on an investment in the Fund.

About the Fund

The Fund has a 10 year term limit. It will terminate on November 24, 2024 unless the Board of Trustees determines that it is in the best interests of the shareholders to extend the term limit for one year or if shareholders vote to shorten or extend the life of the Fund. Upon termination of the Fund, shareholders will receive the NAV per share.

The Fund is managed by Miller/Howard Investments Inc., based in Kingston, New York. Miller/Howard Investments Inc.'s total firm assets as of March 31, 2023 were approximately $3.1 billion, including $0.3 billion in assets under advisement.

Managed Distribution Plan. The above distribution was declared in accordance with the Fund's currently effective managed distribution plan (the Plan), whereby the Fund will make monthly distributions to shareholders at a fixed amount of $0.058 per share. Thus, the distribution amount shown excludes special dividends (which are not paid pursuant to the plan), including the special dividend paid during the current fiscal period in December 2023. The Fund will generally distribute amounts necessary to satisfy the Fund's Plan and the requirements prescribed by excise tax rules and Subchapter M of the Internal Revenue Code. The Plan is intended to provide shareholders with a constant, but not guaranteed, fixed minimum rate of distribution each month and is intended to narrow the discount between the market price and the net asset value of the Fund's common shares, but there is no assurance that the Plan will be successful in doing so.

Under the Plan, to the extent that sufficient investment income is not available on a monthly basis, the Fund will distribute long-term capital gains and/or return of capital in order to maintain its managed distribution rate. As a result, long-term capital gains and/or return of capital may be a material source of any distribution. No conclusions should be drawn about the Fund's investment performance from the amount of the Fund's distributions or from the terms of the Fund's Plan. The Board of Trustees (the Board) may amend the terms of the Plan or terminate the Plan at any time without prior notice to Fund shareholders. No level of distribution can be guaranteed. The amendment or termination of the Plan could have an adverse effect on the market price of the Fund's common shares. The Plan is subject to the periodic review by the Board, including a yearly review of the annual minimum fixed rate to determine if an adjustment should be made.

In compliance with Rule 19a-1 of the Investment Company Act of 1940, shareholders will receive a notice that details the source of income for the above dividend, such as net investment income, gain from the sale of securities and return of principal; however, determination of the actual source of the foregoing dividend can only be made at year-end. The actual source amounts of all Fund dividends will be included in the Fund's annual or semiannual reports. In addition, the tax treatment may differ from the accounting treatment used to calculate the source of the Fund's dividends as shown on shareholders' statements. Shareholders should refer to their Form 1099-DIV for the character and amount of distributions for income tax reporting purposes. Since each shareholder's tax situation is unique, it may be advisable to consult a tax advisor as to the appropriate treatment of Fund distributions.

Past Performance is No Assurance of Future Results. Investment return and principal value of an investment in the Fund will fluctuate. Shares, when sold, may be worth more or less than their original cost. Investors should consider the investment objective, risks and expenses carefully. You can obtain the Fund's most recent periodic reports and filings by visiting https://www.sec.gov/edgar/browse/?CIK=828803&owner=exclude.

Certain Risk Factors: The Fund's investment objective is to provide investors with high current income, with a secondary goal of capital appreciation. There can be no assurance that the Fund will meet its investment objective. The Fund seeks to achieve this objective by investing globally in debt and equity securities of public and private companies, which includes, among other things, investments in closed-end funds, special purpose acquisition companies (SPACs), reinsurance, and public and private debt instruments. The Fund also may utilize derivatives including but not limited to total return swaps, credit default swaps, options (including but not limited to index options) and futures, in seeking to enhance returns and/or to reduce portfolio risk. In addition, on an opportunistic basis, the Fund may also invest up to 15% of its total assets in private funds that focus on debt, equity or other investments consistent with the Fund's investment objective.

The value of equity securities of public and private, listed and unlisted companies and equity derivatives generally varies with the performance of the issuer and movements in the equity markets more generally. As a result, the Fund may suffer losses if it invests in equity instruments of issuers whose performance diverges from the Fund's investment manager's expectations or if equity markets generally move in a single direction and the Fund has not hedged against such a general move. The Fund may invest in closed-end funds and SPACs, which are subject to additional risks and considerations. The performance of reinsurance-related securities and the reinsurance industry itself are tied to the occurrence of various triggering events, including but not limited to weather, natural disasters (hurricanes, earthquakes, etc.), non-natural large catastrophes and other specified events causing physical and/or economic loss. To the extent the Fund invests in reinsurance-related securities for which a triggering event occurs, losses associated with such event could result in losses to the Fund's investment, and a series of major triggering events affecting a large portion of the reinsurance-related securities held by the Fund could result in substantial losses to the Fund's investment. The Fund may invest in high yield securities, which are speculative in nature and are subject to additional risk factors such as increased possibility of default, illiquidity of the security, and changes in value based on changes in interest rates. Changes in short-term market interest rates may directly affect the yield on the Fund's common shares. If such rates fall, the Fund's yield may also fall. If interest rate spreads on bonds and loans owned by the Fund decline in general, the yield on the bonds and loans will likely fall and the value of such bonds and loans may decrease. When short-term market interest rates rise, because of the lag between changes in such short-term rates and the resetting of the floating rates on bonds and loans in the Fund's portfolio, the impact of rising rates will be delayed to the extent of such lag. Because of the limited secondary market for certain bonds and loans, the Fund's ability to sell such securities in a timely fashion and/or at a favorable price may be limited. An increase in the demand for bonds and loans may adversely affect the rate of interest payable on new bonds and loans acquired by the Fund, and it may also increase the price of bonds and loans purchased by the Fund in the secondary market. A decrease in the demand for bonds and loans may adversely affect the price of bonds and loans in the Fund's portfolio, which would cause the Fund's net asset value to decrease. Investment in foreign borrowers involves special risks, including but not limited to potentially less rigorous accounting requirements, differing legal systems and potential political, social and economic adversity. The Fund may engage in currency exchange transactions to seek to hedge, as closely as practicable, all of the economic impact to the Fund arising from foreign currency fluctuations. Other risks include, but are not limited to, the use of derivatives, the potential lack of diversification in the Fund's portfolio, and the fact that the Fund's portfolio may be concentrated in a small group of industries or industry sectors from time to time. Investors should consult the Fund's filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission as well as the materials on the Fund's website for a more detailed discussion of these or other risk factors that affect the Fund.

However, we did see some dollar selling towards at the end of the week despite the US PCE index coming out around expectations at 2.6% on a yearly basis. End-of-week volatility in the dollar and stocks in last horus of US cash market on Friday, may have been influenced by end-of-quarter and end-of-month flows. As I’ve mentioned before, summer can be very slow and choppy, and you may not see any significant breakouts due to a lack of major decisions by big central banks.

However, we must continue to keep track of “what we see rather than what we think” it will happen. That being said I see with a very interesting reversal from the 106 resistance level that we highlighted last week. There is potential for further weakness going into this week, as price can be coming out an ending diagonal pattern. However, it’s unclear how volatile can be this week, maybe some European and US data can impact the FX in next couple of days, but then on Thursday markets can be slow because of US Independence Day, trading conditions that can even expand into Friday. Additionally, US yields are coming a bit higher, so dollar bears may face challenges breaking through the 105 support level.

Key euro area data today as the annual ECB forum starts

Dollar on the back foot amidst a very busy week

Yen remains under pressure

Euro Gains Despite Strong Result From the National Rally Party

France’s National Rally party confirmed expectations by winning the highest level of support in the first round of the country’s parliamentary elections, ahead of the left-wing New Popular Front coalition and miles ahead of Macron’s centrist alliance. National Rally's leader Marie Le Pen has literally won round one of the fight, but nothing has been decided yet as the countdown to the second round, and final one, of elections has already started.

Le Pen is clearly aiming to achieve a majority by winning 289 seats in the next parliament and make President Macron’s life difficult until 2027, when the next presidential elections are scheduled for. However, the left-wing coalition and Macron’s alliance are now weighing whether to support each other's candidates in Sunday’s second round, which could prove successful and potentially stop Le Pen's party from achieving the crucial majority.

European stock markets have opened in the green today and the has gapped higher again against the as the French opposition parties’ seemingly unified front against Le Pen has been seen as a positive step. However, should this effort fail and Le Pen et al manage to achieve a parliamentary majority, there is scope for significant underperformance of the euro across the board.

German Inflation Next; Focus Also on ECB Forums

Amidst these developments in France, the market will have to digest a rather busy schedule, especially in the euro area. The preliminary inflation report from Germany will be published later today with the eurozone aggregate figures coming on Tuesday. There is a small possibility of an upside surprise today, but these inflation prints are unlikely to change the outcome of the July meeting since the ECB hawks remain very uncomfortable about the June rate cut. As President Lagarde mentioned at the last ECB gathering, the ECB needs to see a plethora of data confirming the disinflation process in order to cut rates again.

Interestingly, the annual ECB forum on Central Banking starts today in Sintra, Portugal with Lagarde holding the introductory speech later today. There will be a barrage of speeches from central bankers over the next three days, including comments from various Fed officials with Chairman Powell participating in a panel discussion tomorrow.

Key US Data Week as Biden’s Future in Tatters

The holiday-shortened week across the pond starts on a high note with the release of the June ISM manufacturing survey with the crucial non-farm payroll report coming on Friday. The key point of discussion though in the US is still the recent presidential debate and more specifically President Biden’s performance. Speculation is rife that he could eventually be forced to step down with vice-president Kamala Harris being the frontrunner to replace him.

Yen Remains Under Pressure

Despite the ongoing dollar weakness and a barrage of comments from Japanese government officials, the pair remains above the 160-yen level. It is evident that the market is testing the BoJ, but the mixed data is not giving the green light to Governor Ueda et al to respond appropriately using monetary policy. Market intervention remains the other option for the BoJ, with arguable results at best.","Le Pen is clearly aiming to achieve a majority by winning 289 seats in the next parliament and make President Macron’s life difficult until 2027, when the next presidential elections are scheduled for.

The (XAU) price had decreased by 0.04% by the end of the previous week. On Friday, XAU/USD remained stable throughout the day and moved within the 2,320–2,340 range.

The price of gold remained stable after US data showed a decline in inflation, increasing investors' hopes for an interest rate cut this year. Friday's Personal Consumption Expenditures (PCE) Price Index showed that year-on-year inflation has slowed from 2.7% in April towards 2.6% in May. The latest US inflation data had little effect on market expectations regarding the beginning of the monetary policy easing as it aligned with analysts' expectations. Traders are pricing in a 63% chance of a first rate reduction in September, according to the CME FedWatch Tool. This week, the market is waiting for a speech by Fed Chairman Jerome Powell on Tuesday, followed by the latest Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) meeting minutes on Wednesday and data on the US labour market on Friday. The report will help get more information about the US interest rate path.

Last week, demand for gold in India declined amid rising prices, as many people postponed buying in the hope that the government would reduce import duties.

""Key metals consumer China's manufacturing activity grew at the fastest pace in more than three years, a private sector survey showed. It contrasts with an official PMI released on Sunday that showed a decline in manufacturing activity"", Reuters reports on the situation in another large gold-importing country. ""Although central bank purchases have slowed down in recent months, we believe emerging market's central banks will continue to diversify their reserves into gold"", ANZ said in a quarterly note.

Spot gold was nearly unchanged at $2,324.44 per ounce in the early hours of the European trading session. The market is likely to be calm today, with low volatility. Traders are waiting for Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell's speech tomorrow and the following reports. The price support level is located at 2,300, and the resistance level is at 2,340.

The Euro Rises as the French Election Uncertainty Ease

The euro (EUR) was essentially unchanged on Friday as traders refrained from opening large orders ahead of the first round of French parliamentary elections.

has been in a downtrend for most of June as the outlook for the eurozone economy was clouded by political uncertainty. Moreover, a more cautious approach to future rate cuts by the US Federal Reserve (Fed) also contributed to the euro's weakness. EUR/USD was declining as investors continued to expect the European Central Bank (ECB) to be more dovish than the Fed this year. However, this outlook has started to shift lately. The latest interest rates swap market data implies 45 basis points (bps) worth of rate cuts by the Fed by the end of 2024 and 43 bps rate reductions by the ECB over the same period. Thus, EUR/USD has managed to stabilise in the 1.07000 area. However, the pair may lack a clear trend in the short term and will probably continue to move sideways.

EUR/USD jumped sharply during the Asian trading session and continued to rise in the early European session as the uncertainty surrounding French Parliamentary elections has subsided. Marine Le Pen's far-right National Rally (RN) party won the first round of elections on Sunday but by fewer votes than was initially projected.

""They (RN) have actually performed a little bit worse than what was expected. As a result of that, we saw the euro rise modestly in early Asian trade just because we might actually get less fears of more expansionary and unsustainable fiscal policy if the far-right party did a little bit worse"", said Carol Kong, currency strategist at Commonwealth Bank of Australia (CBA).

Still, EUR/USD hasn't yet broken the downtrend, and the pair has been down by 1% since President Emmanuel Macron called the election on 9 June.

Today, traders should focus on German Consumer Price Index (CPI) reports, which will be released throughout the day, and the US ISM Manufacturing Purchasing Managers Index (PMI) data due at 2:00 p.m. UTC. If German inflation surprises on the upside or US PMI numbers are lower than expected, EUR/USD will almost certainly rise, possibly touching 1.08000. Otherwise, the pair may pull back towards 1.07000 again.

Japan's Growth Problems Deepen, Fueling Yen Weakness

The (JPY) continued to weaken on Friday. USD/JPY set a new multi-decade high as the US Personal Consumption Expenditure (PCE) Price Index figures mostly aligned with market expectations.

US monthly inflation was unchanged in May, while consumer spending rose only marginally, meaning that the Federal Reserve (Fed) may still opt for a 25-basis-point rate cut in September. Investors continue to price in a 63% chance that the Fed's policy easing would start in September, compared to about 64% before the data was released. The (USD) initially dipped against the Japanese yen, a currency highly sensitive to US economic data due to its close link with US Treasury yields. However, the greenback recovered and ended flat on the day, as the larger interest rate gap between the US and Japan remained the key driver for investors.

USD/JPY was rising during the Asian and early European trading sessions. A surprising government update revealed that Japan's Gross Domestic Product (GDP) growth rate in Q1 contracted more sharply than previously estimated. The downward revision might prompt the Bank of Japan (BOJ) to revise its growth forecasts downward in its upcoming projections, potentially impacting the timing of its next interest rate hike. As a result, USD/JPY briefly rose above the 161.00 level.

Today, traders should focus on the US ISM Manufacturing Purchasing Managers' Index (PMI), due at 2:00 p.m. UTC. If the numbers are higher than expected, USD/JPY may continue to rise even though the bullish trend is already quite mature and has been showing technical signs of exhaustion lately. Conversely, weaker-than-expected PMI numbers may prompt a downward correction in USD/JPY, possibly below the 160.00 mark.","Gold Remains Stable Despite Easing US InflationThe (XAU) price had decreased by 0.04% by the end of the previous week.

The New Popular Front – the alliance of left and greens - won 28% of the votes and Emmanuel Macron’s party posted a miserable 20%. The second round is due next weekend.

The kneejerk reaction was a jump in the euro in the early week trading. The jumped past 1.0750, the euro-pound flirted with the 0.85 level and the European futures trade in the positive as a ‘buy the rumour sell the fact’ reaction to the election outcome - and also on chatter that National Rally may not secure an absolute majority in the second round. But there is a non-neglectable chance for Marine Le Pen and Mr, Bardella to win the parliamentary majority next week and that risk will unlikely let the euro run too high before more clarity.

The spread between the French and German 10-year yields topped 80bp last week, a level that has not been seen since the European debt crisis back more than a decade ago. But the French-German spread has room to widen and a Le Pen majority could revive that demon.

Across the Channel, the week starts with increased election vibes as well, because Brits will be headed to their own general election this Thursday with little suspense on the horizon. A Labour win is seen as a net positive for financial markets, and would benefit to banks, homebuilders and groceries the most according to JP Morgan. A Labour should also benefit to the British pound in the long run on hope of improved relations with Europe post- Brexit. In the short run, however, a Labour win is broadly priced in. Therefore the return of the Bank of England (BoE) doves following the election could keep the pound’s upside potential limited. Cable trades around its 50-DMA this morning and may not clear the 1.28 offers even after the election dust settles.

Good news from the data front!

Released on Friday, the US core PCE slowed as expected in May as personal spending fell short of expectations. Combined to Thursday’s soft GDP number, last week’s US data was supportive of the Federal Reserve (Fed) doves. The hit a fresh record, though closed the session in the negative.

But looking back, the S&P 500 and had a stellar H1 thanks to the extension of the tech rally. It would be healthy to see the rally broaden to other sectors provided that the narrow breadth increases the risk of sudden and sharp selloffs. According to Bank of America, the algorithmic models boosted their exposure to technology to such extent that the stop-loss triggers became very tight.

In numbers, the commodity trader advisors, so the automated trade models, can start unwinding their long positions when the US futures drop 2.8% or more, while this threshold was at 4% a month ago. This means that the margin for a misstep becomes narrower and the risk of long squeeze rises as the major US indices travel through uncharted territories on the shoulders of just a few tech names that are probably overpriced.","But the French-German spread has room to widen and a Le Pen majority could revive that demon.

Investing.com,https://www.investing.com/analysis/why-economists-and-citizens-have-different-inflation-realities-200649531,2024-06-29,09:29:00 UTC,Why Economists and Citizens Have Different Inflation Realities,"The Fed and economists are encouraged because is down to 3.3% from a high of nearly 9% in 2022. Despite the Fed’s “significant progress” in lowering inflation, most citizens are outraged and confused by economists’ relatively rosy inflation observations. Most citizens believe inflation is still rampant.

The Fed and economists are correct in that inflation is now tame. At the same time, citizens dissatisfied with high prices have solid grounds on which to base their disapproval.

Let’s better understand how such contradictory beliefs can both be factual. Furthermore, in the process, we can help Jerome Powell understand why economic sentiment is poor despite a near-record low unemployment rate.

You know, I don’t think anyone knows, has a definitive answer why people are not as happy about the economy as they might be. -Jerome Powell 6/12/2024

Visualizing Divergent Inflation Opinions

The graph below of the BLS CPI New Vehicles price index, a CPI component, demonstrates why economists and citizens have such grossly contrasting opinions of inflation.

Economists focus on the blue line, graphing the year-over-year change in new vehicle prices. Over the last year, the price index of new vehicles has decreased by .60%. Economists can say the cost of buying a new vehicle is in a deflationary state.

While the chart may warm the hearts of economists and the Fed, most individuals see the orange line, the CPI price index for new vehicles instead. It shows that new vehicle prices are up about 20% since the pandemic. Yes, they may have recently declined slightly, but today’s prices are nowhere close to where they were four years ago. In their minds, there is significant inflation in new vehicles.

Economists Prefer Growth Rates, Not Absolutes

Ask an economist what the nation’s is, and they will quote an annualized growth rate to a decimal point. We bet almost all of them will get the answer correct within one or two-tenths of one percent.

Ask them again, but request the answer in dollars. It would not be surprising if many economists are off by a trillion or even two trillion dollars, representing anywhere from 3.00% to 7.00% of the economy.

Economists prefer to analyze and quote many economic data points in terms of percentage change. For instance, how much did industrial production or retail sales change versus last month or over the previous quarter or year? They vastly prefer growth rates because it gives them a comparable and insightful way of analyzing economic data. Let’s review why this is the case.

Comparative Analysis

Economists are more adept at comparing data from different periods, industries, and countries if they have a common measurement calculation. Instead of absolute change, which doesn’t account for the starting point, a growth rate captures the absolute change and the starting point. Consider the following:

If GDP increases by $1 trillion this year, how would that compare to a $1 trillion increase in 2000? The question is challenging to answer using absolute numbers. However, growth rates allow us to evaluate the two periods quickly. Today, GDP is $28.284 trillion; therefore, a $1 trillion increase would represent 3.50% growth. In 2000, GDP was close to $10 trillion. Adding a trillion dollars of economic growth would have resulted in a 10% growth rate. While a trillion dollars is a trillion dollars in absolute terms, there is a stark difference between 10% and 3.50% growth.

Trend Analysis

Growth rates highlight trends and changes over time more clearly than absolute numbers. They can show whether an economy is accelerating, decelerating, or maintaining a steady pace.

Consider the graph below. The blue line, showing the make-believe production of widgets, starts at 1,000 widgets and increases by 100 widgets annually. The steady growth in absolute terms is a linear upward trending line. However, the annual growth rate steadily declines from 10% to 4% by year 20. An economist looking at the graph would say the rate of the production of widgets is declining despite the upward trend in the number of widgets being produced annually.

Policy Decision Making

The Fed aims to promote stable economic growth. To do so they balance the level of interest rates with inflation and economic activity. Having like figures to analyze, such as growth rates, makes their task significantly more straightforward. Imagine if the Fed had to determine the appropriate interest rate given that the economy grew by $750 billion last year and the CPI price index rose by 2.45.

Investors prefer growth rates for the same reason. If I can estimate the economy’s growth rate and other critical economic figures, they can better determine a growth rate or interest rate they would accept for taking risks.

The capital asset pricing model (CAPM) is a bedrock for finance. The formula states that an asset’s expected return should equal the risk-free interest rate plus the asset’s sensitivity (beta) times the market’s expected return. This formula can only work with growth rates, not absolute numbers.

Consumer’s Point Of View

Regarding inflation, consumers are less concerned with growth rates and heavily focused on absolute prices. They remember that bread used to cost $4 a loaf and now costs $7. The graph below shows the price of white bread was stable between $1.25 and $1.50 a pound from 2008 to the pandemic. It is now close to $2 a pound.

That is significant inflation. But it doesn’t tell the whole story. If wages also rose similarly, purchasing power hasn’t changed. It is similar to hearing stories from your parents or grandparents about going to the movies and getting popcorn and a soda, all for $1. Did you ever ask them how much money they made at the time?

Summary

We want to make it clear that we do not condone inflation. It accelerates an already wide wealth gap and creates hardships for many citizens. For more, please read our article, .

We analyze inflation data similarly to economists. We accept that absolute prices are much higher today than a few years ago, but we also acknowledge that, in general, wages are higher as well. Just like we can’t realistically compare a 15-cent ) hamburger to a $3.00 one today, we should be careful comparing prices today to their prices a few years ago.

Prices are not returning to 2020 levels. In fact, any hint that aggregate prices retreat from current levels will cause the Fed to panic and quickly stimulate inflation via lower interest rates and QE. We remind you that the Fed was lamenting that we didn’t have enough inflation throughout most of the period between the financial crisis and the pandemic.","Despite the Fed’s “significant progress” in lowering inflation, most citizens are outraged and confused by economists’ relatively rosy inflation observations.

Focus today turns to core PCE inflation

Yen slides, intervention risks rise

French citizens head to the ballots on Sunday

Trump Election Win Bets Support Dollar

The traded slightly lower against most of its major peers on Thursday, extending gains only against the and the . That said, the greenback is on the front foot again today, gaining the most ground versus the and the .

What helped the dollar move higher during the Asian session today may have been the debate between the 2024 presidential candidates Joe Biden and Donald Trump, with the latter seen as putting in a stronger showing than the incumbent President.

The likelihood of Trump returning to the Oval Office could mean lower corporate taxes, tougher trade relations, and consequently more advances on Wall Street and higher Treasury yields. The prospect of more tariffs on China may be the reason why the dollar is gaining the most against the aussie and the kiwi, as China is the main trading partner of both Australia and New Zealand.

PCE Inflation Expected to Cool

Today, dollar traders are likely to turn their attention to the core PCE price index for May, the Fed’s favorite inflation metric. Expectations are for a slowdown to 2.6% y/y from 2.8%, something supported by the slide in the core CPI rate for the month.

Currently, market participants are penciling in around a 70% chance of a first quarter-point reduction by the Fed in September. Thus, a slide in the core PCE rate may encourage them to take that percentage higher and thereby sell some dollars.

Yen Traders Stay on Intervention Watch

The yen continued to bleed, with the dollar/yen briefly breaking above 161 earlier today as traders continued to test the nerves of Japanese authorities, which have lately become vocal again about one-sided declines in their currency.

The acceleration in the Tokyo CPI figures for June passed unnoticed by yen traders, though the probability of another 10bps hike by the BoJ in July remained elevated at around 60%.

What’s even more interesting is that today, the Japanese government replaced the nation’s top currency diplomat Masato Kanda with financial regulation expert Atsushi Mimura. With Finance Minister Suzuki noting that authorities remain “deeply concerned” about the impact of steep yen declines, Kanda’s replacement may have increased the risk for a new intervention episode soon.

In light of this, yen traders may now be keener to cover some of their short positions to minimize potential losses in case of intervention, something that could result in a small setback in the dollar/yen.

French Election, Round One

In Europe, the spotlight is turning to the first round of the French elections. If no candidate gets an absolute majority, which is the most likely case, the top two candidates, and any other that receives more than 12.5% of the registered votes, move to a second round.

Opinion polls suggest that Le Pen’s far-right National Rally is likely to secure the most seats in Parliament, but not a majority. The far-left New Popular Front is seen second and Macron’s Ensemble coalition third.

This first round could shed light on how likely it is for Le Pen to form a coalition with smaller parties after the second round, or whether the nation will be left with a completely hung parliament. Given that no election can take place for another year under the French Constitution after this, a hung parliament may be the worst-case scenario for the as the Eurozone’s second-largest economy will enter a prolonged period of political stalemate.","PCE Inflation Expected to CoolToday, dollar traders are likely to turn their attention to the core PCE price index for May, the Fed’s favorite inflation metric.

1. Fed Chair Powell at the ECB Forum - July 2

Federal Reserve Chair Jerome is set to make an appearance at the ECB Forum on Central Banking in Sintra, Portugal on Tuesday, July 2.

Source: Investing.com

Powell has used this platform in the past to pre-announce key policy decisions, making his remarks potentially pivotal.

Investors will scrutinize his speech for hints about the Fed's future policy direction, especially ahead of the critical FOMC meeting at the end of the month.

2. U.S. Jobs Report - Friday, July 5

The U.S. Labor Department will release the monthly jobs report at 8:30 AM ET on Friday, July 5, and it will be a critical indicator of the health of the U.S. labor market.

With employment numbers serving as a bellwether for economic stability and growth, investors will be keenly observing job creation, , and wage growth. Forecasts center around a continued solid pace of hiring, even if the increase is smaller than in previous months.

The consensus estimate is that the the U.S. economy added 180,000 positions in June, slowing from jobs growth of 272,000 in May. The unemployment rate is seen holding steady at 4.0%.

Source: Investing.com

A strong jobs report could reinforce confidence in the economy, while weaker-than-expected numbers might raise concerns about a potential slowdown.

3. U.S. CPI Data - Thursday, July 11

On Thursday, July 11, the Consumer Price Index ( ) inflation data will be released. This report will be closely monitored as inflation remains a central issue for both the Federal Reserve and the broader market.

While no official forecasts have been set yet, expectations for annual headline CPI range from an increase of 3.0% to 3.2%, compared to a 3.3% annual pace in May.

Meanwhile, estimates for the year-on-year figure - which does not include food and energy prices - center around an increase of 3.1%-3.3%, compared to May’s 3.4% reading.

Source: Investing.com

The headline annual CPI rate peaked at a 40-year high of 9.1% in the summer of 2022 and has been on a steady downtrend since, however, prices are still rising at a pace well above the Fed’s 2% target range despite a series of 11 rate hikes.

Any surprises in the inflation figures could significantly impact market sentiment and expectations for future Fed policy actions.

4. Q2 Earnings Season Kickoff - July 12

The second-quarter earnings season kicks off on Friday, July 12 with JPMorgan Chase (NYSE: ) releasing its quarterly results. Earnings reports will be crucial in assessing the health and performance of corporate America amid economic uncertainties.

Key companies reporting in July include:

Tesla (NASDAQ: ) on July 23

Meta Platforms (NASDAQ: ) on July 24

Microsoft (NASDAQ: ) and Alphabet (NASDAQ: ) on July 25

Amazon (NASDAQ: ) on July 30

These tech giants, which have been major contributors to the market's year-to-date rally, will be under the spotlight. Their earnings and guidance will provide valuable insights into the state of the tech sector and broader market trends.

Some of the other notable companies reporting results also include Bank of America (NYSE: ), Goldman Sachs (NYSE: ), Morgan Stanley (NYSE: ), Netflix (NASDAQ: ), American Express (NYSE: ), Visa (NYSE: ), Coca-Cola (NYSE: ), United Airlines (NASDAQ: ), Ford (NYSE: ), General Motors (NYSE: ), Boeing (NYSE: ), Caterpillar (NYSE: ), AT&T (NYSE: ), Verizon (NYSE: ), ExxonMobil (NYSE: ), and Chevron (NYSE: ).

FOMC Meeting - Wednesday, July 31

The Federal Reserve's FOMC policy meeting on Wednesday, July 31 will arguably be the most anticipated event of the month.

With ongoing debates about the appropriate timing for rate cuts, the Fed's statement and Chairman Powell's subsequent press conference will be closely watched.

The FOMC is not publishing updated ‘dot-plot’ economic forecasts, and so any changes in the Fed's tone or policy outlook could have significant implications for the stock market.

As of Friday morning, financial markets are pricing in a roughly 90% chance of no action, according to the Investing.com . That would leave the benchmark Fed funds target range between 5.25% and 5.50%, where it has been since July 2023.

Source: Investing.com

Coming into 2024, investors were expecting multiple rate cuts. However, stubbornly high levels of inflation and signs of a resilient economy have continually pushed back that possibility.

Conclusion

July promises to be a month packed with critical events that could shape the stock market's trajectory for the remainder of the year. From key economic data releases to pivotal central bank meetings and corporate earnings reports, investors must stay vigilant and prepared for potential volatility.

To navigate the current market backdrop I used the InvestingPro stock screener to build a watchlist of high-quality stocks that are showing strong relative strength and have healthy growth prospects.

Not surprisingly, some of the names to make the list include Nvidia (NASDAQ: ), Alphabet (NASDAQ: ), and Chipotle Mexican Grill (NYSE: ) to name a few.

The (XAU) price rose by more than 1% on Thursday as the (USD) weakened after weaker-than-expected core durable goods orders and housing data.

Yesterday's US macroeconomic statistics underscored the slowing of the economy. Specifically, yesterday's final Gross Domestic Product data revealed a significant decrease in the US economic growth in Q1. Additionally, business spending on equipment fell in May, while a decline in exports widened the trade deficit in goods. As a result, the probability of two rate cuts from the Federal Reserve (Fed) in 2024 increased, pushing the US dollar down and making gold more attractive for holders of other currencies.

Moreover, investors were anticipating the debate between two US presidential candidates. The market also closely monitored any signs that the Japanese government might step in to support the Japanese yen, which remained near its lowest level in 38 years. This uncertainty boosted the demand for gold, a traditional safe-haven asset during economic and political turmoil.

XAU/USD was falling during the Asian and early European trading session as traders focused on the key US inflation data, which is due later today. The US Bureau of Economic Analysis will release its Personal Consumption Expenditure (PCE) Price Index at 12:30 p.m. UTC. The data is the Fed's preferred measure of inflation, and the report will likely have a major impact on investors' interest rate expectations. If PCE figures are higher than expected, XAU/USD will almost certainly drop, possibly below 2,290. Conversely, lower-than-expected numbers may extend the short-term bullish trend in gold.

""Spot gold may retest support at $2,299 per ounce, as the bounce triggered by this barrier is considered random"", said Reuters analyst Wang Tao.

The Euro Rises on a Weaker US Dollar, but French Elections Produce Uncertainty

The (EUR) gained 0.22% against the US dollar (USD) on Thursday but failed to hold above the important 1.07150 level.

Soft economic data from the US sparked a sell-off in the US dollar yesterday, as investors continue to believe that the Federal Reserve (Fed) will deliver two rate cuts in 2024. Meanwhile, the European Central Bank (ECB) is also expected to provide two 25-basis-point (bps) rate cuts this year, but the market is confident that the ECB should generally remain more dovish than the Fed. Germany reported yesterday that its import prices dropped by 0.4% in May, while the market anticipated only a 0.3% decline. The euro faces additional pressure from political instability as France gears up for a snap election this weekend. France is already subject to E.U. disciplinary measures due to its budget deficit. Now, the fact that far-right nationalist parties are leading the polls has further exacerbated concerns about France's fiscal sustainability.

EUR/USD was falling during the Asian and early European trading session as traders started to reposition ahead of today's US Personal Consumption Expenditure (PCE) Price Index report, due at 12:30 p.m. UTC. It is the Fed's preferred measure of inflation and will likely have a major impact on investors' interest rate expectations. If the figures are higher than expected, EUR/USD will likely drop, possibly below the 1.06600 level. Otherwise, the pair may rise above 1.07200.

Bitcoin Surged on Trump-Biden Debate

(BTC) rose overnight by more than 1% as the market favored Trump in a debate with Biden.

Bitcoin was trading near 61,485 before the debate between two presidential candidates began but quickly surged towards 62,157 as Donald Trump and Joe Biden responded to questions from CNN moderators. Although not directly mentioned in the debate, cryptocurrency has become a significant point of interest in the election confrontation. On 16 June, Trump stated he would end Biden's 'war on crypto' if he is elected. In March, Trump made a post expressing his intention to make the US a global leader in crypto technology and criticized Biden, saying the current President would see crypto 'die a slow and painful death'.

However, President Biden recently vetoed a resolution that would have repealed a Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) accounting guideline preventing banks from holding crypto assets on their balance sheets. Notably, the resolution passed through both the House and the Senate with majority support. Biden explained his decision, saying he refused to pass legislation that would 'jeopardize the well-being of consumers and investors'.

After the debates, slowly returned towards 61,485 in the Asian and early European trading sessions. Today, traders should focus on the release of the US Personal Consumption Expenditures (PCE) Price Index at 12:30 p.m. UTC. In theory, lower-than-expected figures should positively impact BTC/USD, potentially pushing the price above 62,000. However, the bearish trend in the pair may continue if the figures are better than expected.","The US Bureau of Economic Analysis will release its Personal Consumption Expenditure (PCE) Price Index at 12:30 p.m. UTC.

During LSEG Lipper’s fund-flows week that ended June 19, 2024, investors were overall net redeemers of fund assets (including both conventional funds and ETFs) for the first week in three, removing a net $30.0 billion.

The rally marks the second straight month that American shares led global markets, based on a set of ETFs.

Vanguard Total Stock Market Index Fund ETF Shares (NYSE: ) rose 3.1%, easily outperforming the rest of the field. VTI is now up 13.6% year to date, which is also the leading return for 2024.

Stocks in emerging markets ( ) posted the second-best performance last month. The ETF’s 2.0% gain builds on its recent rebound, lifting the fund 7.0% so far this year.

US real estate investment trusts also extended their recent recovery. Vanguard Real Estate ( ), the third-best performer in June, rose 1.9%. That still leaves the fund modestly in the red for the year, although that’s a substantial improvement from earlier in 2024, .

Despite solid gains in some corners, there was plenty of red ink last month for some markets. The biggest loss in June: foreign real estate ( ), which shed 2.7% and is off nearly 5% for the year so far.

The Global Market Index (GMI) extended its recent rally, rising 1.6% in June. GMI is an unmanaged benchmark (maintained by CapitalSpectator.com) that holds all the major asset classes (except cash) in market-value weights via ETFs and represents a competitive benchmark for multi-asset-class portfolios. Year to date, GMI is up 8.2% — only US stocks (VTI) and commodities ( ) are posting stronger gains for 2024.

For the one-year window, GMI continues to reflect a middling performance relative to US stocks (VTI) and US bonds ( ).","The rally marks the second straight month that American shares led global markets, based on a set of ETFs.

This came following a Friday morning rally met by selling that started a bit after 10 a.m.

The selling was enough to push the S&P 500 more than 1% off its morning highs and create a bearish engulfing candle on the daily chart. It was the second such candle in a week.

This has created 2 key reversal patterns that the bulls will look to avoid this week:

1. 2B Daily Top Reversal Pattern

It also created what appears to be a 2b top reversal pattern. These patterns don’t always work, but they are nice to use because they give us levels to work with that tell us a lot about where the market may be heading.

This pattern often forms when an index or stock attempts to make a new, fails to hold that high, and then closes below the previous closing high.

2. Weekly Close Pattern

Even on the weekly candle, we saw this week’s high surpass last week’s high, with the index closing lower on the week. This doesn’t happen often, but it has happened several times since January 2020.

Over that time, it appears to have occurred eight other times, and 7 of those times, it has led to a lower week the following week. In 5 of the seven occasions, it led to declines of 35.3%, 11.2%, 14.4%, 12.9%, and 19.3%.

On the other two occasions, the index fell by 2.1%; on the other, it fell by 2.5%. There was only one time the index moved higher: in January 2021. So, the signal carries some weight with it and should not be ignored or easily dismissed.

This tells us a couple of things that we can use to help us better assess what comes next. If the S&P 500 closes above 5,487.02 on the daily chart this week, the daily 2b top trading pattern will be invalidated.

The weekly reversal candle will be invalidated if the S&P 500 closes above 5464.61 on the weekly chart.

People will look at this and say it is ridiculous to think that the S&P 500 could drop by some of the abovementioned values. I could also argue that it would have been foolish to believe that the S&P 500 could rally as much as it has since the October 2023 low.

It took the S&P 500 271 days to rally approximately 18% from 4,100 on April 8, 2021, to the intraday high of 4,818 on January 4, 2022, when overnight rates were 0%, and the Fed was conducting QE. It has taken the S&P 500 245 days to rally 34.4% from its low on October 27 of 4,100 to its intraday high the week of June 28, with overnight rates of 5.33% and the Fed draining the balance sheet.

Which one sounds more ridiculous now? So caution is warranted currently, and being cautious is not the same as being short or perma bearish. It is about assessing the odds and managing one’s risk.

Some conditions in this market are at extremes, especially regarding implied correlations, which closed below 6, the lowest level ever, not by a little but by more than a whole point at 5.59 versus the previous low of 6.78 in October 2017.

Meanwhile, high-yield credit spreads are trending higher as stock prices rise. We last saw these conditions develop in January 2020 and the fall of 2021.

In the meantime, the appears to be in the process of completing a giant ascending broadening wedge, as the 20-day moving average is serving as support for the ETF. A break of support at $255 would confirm that the pattern has broken and that a move lower has begun.

Meanwhile, Nvidia (NASDAQ: ) is wedged between the 10-day exponential and the 20-day simple moving averages, which means that things are quite easy because a close above the 10-day EMA could signal a move higher, followed by confirmation, which could lead to pushback to $130. A close below the 20-day moving average, followed by confirmation, could open the floodgates.

That’s all from me. You may not hear from me again until July 10.

Have a happy Fourth of July!

The major indexes are reaching new highs and portraying an image of economic health and investor confidence. However, beneath this seemingly strong facade lies a troubling sign for market participants: a significant deterioration in market breadth.

Market breadth is a crucial measure that indicates the overall market's health. It reflects the number of stocks participating in the uptrend. Currently, while major indexes like the and are climbing, most individual stocks within these indexes are underperforming. This divergence suggests that the gains are being driven by a few large-cap stocks, masking the struggles of the majority.

This trend of narrowing market breadth has persisted throughout the year. Such a scenario can sustain an upward trajectory for the indexes in the short term, driven by the performance of a select few. However, it also increases the likelihood of a market pullback, especially as these indexes become overextended.

With the current market advance showing signs of reaching an overbought state, it’s a critical time for investors to exercise caution. The disparity between index performance and individual stock performance serves as a warning that the market's strength may be more fragile than it appears on the surface.

Visualizing the Divergence: A Tale of Two Indexes

In the chart below, we have a clear visual representation of the growing disparity in market performance. The top panel illustrates the capitalization-weighted S&P 500, which, as noted in the introduction, has continued its ascent, reaching new highs and showcasing the robust performance of the largest stocks within the index. The lower panel, however, tells a different story. This panel displays the , where each stock contributes equally to the index, offering a more balanced view of the broader market's health.

From the start of the year until the end of March, both indexes moved in harmony, reflecting a broad-based rally where gains were relatively evenly distributed among the stocks. However, the divergence that began in April is striking. While the capitalization-weighted S&P 500 maintained its upward momentum, driven by a handful of dominant large-cap stocks, the Equal Weighted S&P 500 began to falter, trending downward. This negative divergence highlights that the majority of stocks within the index have not shared in the recent gains, revealing a troubling decline in market breadth.

The significance of this divergence cannot be overstated. It underscores the cautionary message from the introduction: despite the impressive performance of the headline index, underlying market strength is weakening. The few stocks leading the charge higher can mask the broader market's struggles, but this imbalance often precedes corrections or pullbacks, especially when the market becomes overly extended. Investors should be wary of this trend, as it suggests that the apparent resilience of the market may be more fragile and susceptible to reversal than it appears on the surface.

Divergence Deepens: A Closer Look at Market Breadth

The next chart provides a deeper dive into the evolving landscape of market breadth and further underscores the cautionary signals we've been discussing. The top panel depicts the S&P 500, which has been on an impressive upward trajectory since emerging from a short-term pullback at the end of October 2023. This rally has carried the index to new heights through June 2024, reflecting an ostensibly strong and resilient market.

However, the middle and bottom panels reveal a starkly different narrative. The middle panel tracks the percentage of stocks within the S&P 500 that are above their respective 200-day moving averages, a long-term trend indicator. Since April 2024, this percentage has been in a consistent decline, suggesting that fewer stocks are maintaining their long-term uptrends despite the index's continued advance.

The bottom panel paints an even more concerning picture, showing the percentage of stocks above their 50-day moving averages, a short-term trend indicator. This percentage has been falling since January 2024, indicating that a majority of stocks are failing to sustain even their short-term momentum. The divergence between the S&P 500's performance and the weakening trend participation of its components is clear and concerning.

Notably, the chart highlights the month of June 2024 with a vertical blue line, drawing attention to the continued advance of the S&P 500 during this period. Despite this upward movement, both the middle and bottom panels indicate that the percentage of stocks above their moving averages remained flat, failing to confirm the index's gains. This sideways movement in June suggests a further erosion of market breadth, highlighting that the index's rally is increasingly being driven by a shrinking number of outperforming stocks.

Conclusion

In summary, despite the impressive advance of major indexes like the S&P 500, underlying market strength is weakening. The declining participation of stocks in this rally highlights a troubling divergence and signals a fragile foundation. Investors should approach the market with caution, mindful that the impressive gains of a few cannot indefinitely mask the broader market’s fragility and the increased risk of a significant pullback.

Current Portfolio Allocation: Emphasizing Defense

Given the current market environment, we have positioned all client accounts with a distinctly defensive posture. Our strategy includes an oversized allocation to cash and high-yielding money market funds, ensuring liquidity and stability amid market uncertainties. Additionally, our equity exposure is kept deliberately low, complemented by strategic short positions to serve as hedges against potential market downturns.

One of the key reasons behind our conservative stance on stocks is the prevailing market dynamics that tend to undermine stock performance in environments like this. As discussed earlier, market breadth has been deteriorating, meaning that an increasing number of stocks are struggling or declining.

In such scenarios, the chances of successfully navigating the stock market diminish significantly. Historically, investing in stocks during periods of narrowing breadth often results in subpar returns, as overall market strength is primarily driven by a select few outperformers, while the majority lag or falter.

By maintaining a cautious allocation and focusing on defensive assets, we aim to protect capital and reduce the potential for losses, positioning our clients to weather any volatility that may arise from the current market fragility.","The disparity between index performance and individual stock performance serves as a warning that the market's strength may be more fragile than it appears on the surface.

The above table reflects the historical trends in EPS and revenue growth, starting with Q1 ’23, and for the last two quarters shows how the estimates changed during the Q4 ’23 reporting period and then again for Q1 ’24’s reporting period.

Data source: LSEG (formerly IBES data by Refinitiv)

Here’s what jumped out in looking at this table:

1.) The technology sector still faces a very weak comp in Q2 ’24, versus the Q2 ’23 numbers: tech sector EPS grew only 5% on flat revenue in Q2 ’23. Today, the tech sector EPS is expected to grow 16.9% in Q2 ’24, on revenue growth of 6.7% y-o-y.

More importantly, readers should look at the technology EPS line in Q1 ’23 and then read across (right to left) and note where tech sector EPS growth estimates started in Q4 ’23 and Q1 ’24 and then ended 12 weeks later. Tech sector revenue was pretty much unchanged (no real trend in revenue growth) the last two quarters.

2.) Energy sector: energy sector growth has been negative the last 4 quarters but is expected it improve sharply in Q2 ’24. Same with energy revenue growth, but revenue has been negative the last 5 quarters, i.e. Q1 ’23 through Q1 ’24, but is expected to be +6.4% in Q2 ’24.

3.) Communication services: look at the trend improvement in EPS in Q1 ’24 for Comm Services (i.e. META (NASDAQ: ) and Google (NASDAQ: ) is the lion’s share of the sector). META is now facing tough comps since the stock bottomed in Q3 ’23, and margin grew sharply from there. The easy money may have been made for META, to this point, which is not to say the stock goes down, but META’s operating margin did grow sharply in ’23 and Q1 ’24.

4.) The capital tests for the bank led to a number of buybacks and dividend increases for the big banks on Friday night, June 28, ’24. Let’s see if the financial sector EPS gets a bump into the month of July ’24, as I’m expecting it to do. Capital markets activity, like bond issuance, should still be fairly healthy, although the IPO market seems quiet.

5.) Finally the healthcare sector is expecting it’s best EPS growth since Q1 ’22 in Q2 ’24 at +20.2%. It’s had a horrid string of negative y-o-y growth EPS quarters since Q4 ’22. Healthcare revenue growth is rock solid. Hasn’t wavered much at all although it was mid-teens growth in ’21 and ’22, that has tapered down to mid-single-digits in ’23 and now ’24 no doubt as the Covid vaccines have faded. GLP-1 drugs have really helped growth – even Pfizer (NYSE: ) says they are experimenting with one, although they are well behind the curve.

If readers own just the 5 sectors mentioned that is 70% of the S&P 500’s market cap as of this weekend. No mention was made of consumer discretionary since EPS slowed down from 40% – 50%+ growth in ’23 to 20% – 30% in Q4 ’23 and Q1 ’24, while revenue growth slowed from high-single-digits to mid-single-digits from ’23 into ’24. Tesla’s slowdown in revenue and EPS growth has had to hurt the sector, although Amazon (NASDAQ: ) remains pretty stable. (Amazon and Tesla (NASDAQ: ) were the two biggest sector weights in early ’23.)

Conclusion:

These historical sectors EPS and revenue growth (estimate vs actual) go all the way back to 2010 and 2011, but that data really isn’t relevant today. I started logging the values just to see what was “high, average and low” growth rates, but Covid really skewed the data, resulting in exceptionally high and low figures.

Q2 ’21 saw 96% EPS growth for the S&P 500 on 25% revenue growth. Obviously, that’s not anything near normal.

Q2 ’22 S&P 500 EPS growth is expected at +10.6%, the best quarter of EPS growth since Q1 ’22, while expected revenue growth at +4.2% is the strongest quarter expected since Q1 ’23’s +5.6% actual growth.

Disclosure: Anyway, none of this is advice or a recommendation, but rather an opinion. The goal through the summer will be to see how revenue and EPS growth by sector track versus the starting estimates on June 30 ’24. Past performance is no guarantee of future results. Investing can involve the loss of principal, even for short periods of time. All EPS and revenue data is sourced from the London Stock Exchange Group (www.LON: .com).

Investing.com,https://www.investing.com/analysis/sp-500-earnings-june-payroll-report-next-friday-200649632,2024-07-01,06:09:00 UTC,S&P 500 Earnings: June Payroll Report Next Friday,"Thanks to the above table from Briefing.com, it’s labor force data week, with JOLTS due out Tuesday morning, ADP Wednesday morning, jobless claims due out Thursday morning and then the all-important June nonfarm payroll report will be out Friday morning, July 5th at 7:30 am.

Readers can see the expectations for June's nonfarm payroll results in the above table. The unemployment report has risen from a low of 3.2% post-pandemic to 4% as of last month. While the nonfarm payroll number is the business survey and thus more closely followed by investors, the unemployment rate matters greatly to politicians since that one single number can sum up the political environment in one single digit.

The Fed has gotten inflation down as low as it can, without labor market weakness dropping it further.

The constant talk about rate cuts by the Fed, will likely be just that – talk – until labor market weakness surfaces.

Hard to say when that happens.

The fact is the economy remains in very good shape.

The Core PCE data for May reported this morning, fell to +2.6%, versus +2.8% last month. The Fed’s almost there…

S&P 500 Data:

The forward 4-quarter estimate slipped a little this week to $252.85 from last weeks $253.84;

The PE ratio on the forward estimate is now 21.6x versus 21.55x last week;

The earnings yield slipped to 4.63% from last weeks 4.64% even though the S&P 500 fell slightly on the week;

With this being the last week of reporting for Q1 ’24, the S&P 500 EPS rose +8.2% (after bottoming at 5% on April 5th) while S&P 500 revenue rose +3.95%, after bottoming at 3% on April 5th, ’24.

Expect Q2 ’24 revisions to be negative next week but the strength in expected Q2 ’24 EPS and revenue growth has been unusually solid at +10.6% expected EPS growth and +4.2% revenue growth.

Conclusion:

The holiday-shortened week will likely mean lean trading desks the morning of the nonfarm payroll report on July 5th, ’24.

In these quarterly letters we share our performance highlights and trends that are shaping our investment approach.

Spear Alpha ETF (NASDAQ: ) was up 4.22% in 1Q24 compared to the , up 10.56%, and the , up 9.31%. Over the past year, SPRX was up 56.2% vs. the S&P500 29.9% and the Nasdaq Composite up 35.08%.

Summary:

As interest rates rose in 1Q24, investors shifted to playing defense, increasing their exposure to mega caps and defensive sectors like utilities. We responded to this by focusing on risk management, limiting our underperformers, and positioning ourselves to capture the next wave of opportunities. These periods of consolidation create the best entry points (both for investing in our fund and for us to find opportunities).

After a strong finish to 2023 with excitement over interest rate cuts, 2024 started on a defensive note, with interest rates trickling up and expectations for rate cuts lowered from seven rate cuts to potentially none. As a result, the market outperformance has been driven by mega-cap technology and sectors like utilities, which indicate that investors are playing defense.

The average member within the Nasdaq has had a >35% drawdown from peak this year while, the has had no more than a 7% drawdown, demonstrating how bifurcated this year's performance has been between mega-caps and the rest of the space.

During these periods of consolidation (risk-off), like in 1Q24, we shift our focus to risk management. But unlike most funds, where risk management means reducing risk, for us, it means managing risk and selectively increasing it, especially after periods like May, when we saw panic selling, particularly in software. These drawdowns allow us to add to our high-conviction ideas at attractive prices.

There is no question that we are in the early innings of the next technology cycle amplified by AI. What has been unusual about this recovery is that instead of the Federal Reserve stimulating the economy, it is providing a headwind. In the short run investor sentiment is very much tied to interest rates, which we expect to remain range-bound. As rates increase towards 5%, investors turn to risk-off, and the economy weakens (jobs, consumer sentiment, inflation down); conversely, as rate cuts take the front seat and the declines, investors turn to risk-on.

These periods of consolidation create the best entry points (both for investing in our fund and for us to find opportunities).

How Do We Manage Risk?

We have two main tools for risk management:

1. We increase our idea velocity: during periods of consolidation, we increase the pace of generating new ideas (e.g., in the past 3-4 months, we have increased our exposure further down the data center value chain, specifically expanding to areas ""outside of the rack"" including materials, components, and electricity generation).

2. We take profits on outperformers and cut/reduce losers. The most important aspect of this is that we try to maintain the same level of risk so that when the market turns to risk-on, we are positioned to capture the benefit.

Fundamental active strategies, in general, perform better in a risk-on environment as investors are looking to allocate to ideas that capture alpha and broaden their exposure beyond just tracking broader market.

What Gives Us Confidence for the Rest of the Year:

Capex spending cycle just kicked in. Coming out of the 1Q24 earnings season, a constant theme was increased capex. Expectations for hyperscaler capex growth are now +40% yoy vs. ~20% as we entered the year with the five largest hyperscalers investing >$200B. Estimates for '25 are >$250B which could prove to be conservative as Nvidia (NASDAQ: )'s Blackwell (B100) chip is entering production and offers significantly lower TCO (total cost of ownership).

Data Center investment cycle is broadening-out . AI spending last year was mostly focused on processors/GPUs and Nvidia was the only company that got a meaningful boost from AI. This year we are starting to note the impact of the AI spending wave both inside the rack (processors, networking, memory) and outside of the rack (electrical and thermal management, power generation etc.).

This year we are starting to note the impact of the AI spending wave both inside the rack (processors, networking, memory) and outside of the rack (electrical and thermal management, power generation etc.). Attractive valuations. Valuations for mega-cap technology have expanded over the past 6 months but are still within historical ranges. Valuations for mid-caps (<$100B), especially on the software side, have pulled back meaningfully and are near the '20 and '22 lows.

Performance contributors and commentary

The most significant change to our portfolio in '24 vs. '23 was that we expanded our Data Center hardware investments beyond processors (GPUs) and created a new focus area, ""Materials & Power Generation,"" which we expect will benefit from a broader data center build-out.

The types of companies included in this area are 1) materials such as , 2) components such as electrical equipment, connectors, and thermal management, and 3) power generation, including independent power generators. As many of these companies are cyclical, the turnover of this basket is higher than some of our other focus areas, where we often maintain our holdings through the cycle (in varying sizes).

For 1Q24 our out-performers were:

Data Center Hardware. Nvidia (NVDA) stood out and was our best-performing idea in the quarter and ytd. AMD (NASDAQ: ) and Marvell (NASDAQ: ) also outperformed the rest of our portfolio but underperformed our expectations. The underperformance is because while AI is a positive contributor for these companies, it is not material enough to offset weakness in the rest of their businesses. We are being patient with these companies as we expect that it may take 1+ years to scale their new products.

Freeport McMoran (NYSE: ) and Teck Resources (NYSE: ) outperformed the rest of our portfolio. Since the end of the quarter, we took some profit in copper and redeployed it to other areas in power generation and connectors.

Our underperformers were Cybersecurity and Data Infrastructure companies, which was the reverse of 4Q23. While it may not be obvious from looking at the broad indices, the software sector got destroyed in 1Q24 and continued to face significant pressure, specifically in May. What started as a pull-back turned into carnage, with many companies down 40%+ since the end of 23.

Cybersecurity. Despite ransomware hitting all-time highs and now affecting over 10% of organizations, cybersecurity got caught up in the software sell-off. For cybersecurity specifically, interest rates were the main negative driver, while fundamentals have remained strong. Crowdstrike (CRWD) was the relative outperformer in the quarter vs. Zscaler (NASDAQ: ) (S) and Sentinel One (S) , which meaningfully underperformed.

For cybersecurity specifically, interest rates were the main negative driver, while fundamentals have remained strong. was the relative outperformer in the quarter vs. and , which meaningfully underperformed. Data Infrastructure. In addition to interest rates, data infrastructure software did not deliver the expected fundamental improvement in 1Q23. There are two main reasons behind this that we have identified:



1. The initial investment wave in AI has been securing hardware and ""renting"" this hardware as a service. Revenue from selling software services and applications is still in the early days. This is why companies like Datadog (NASDAQ: ), while still growing, are tracking below the historical 2x the rate of AWS growth (Amazon (NASDAQ: )).



2. Companies cut spending during the downturn and were more focused on reaching profitability at the expense of growth, which is now coming back to bite them. A common theme that we are noting is that companies that were supposed to be growing 30-40% are now growing only 20%. Snowflake (NYSE: ) is a prime example. Some of this is a function of weak macro/enterprise spending, but some of it may be related to dropping the ball. We have largely maintained our exposures but are looking to selectively add to the ones that are able to play offense rather than defense.



While we are not concerned about the first point as we are confident that as companies start building on top of the hardware, they will need the software services (especially critical ones like cybersecurity, observability, and data streaming), we are laser-focused on the second to make sure we don't get stuck with the losers.

We are maintaining our balanced positioning between software and hardware, but we have started adding to software on a selective basis, expecting to benefit if interest rates stabilize.

We continue to manage risk actively and asses the potential risk/reward of each individual holding, incorporating the trajectory of earnings and valuation. We aspire to perform in line with diversified indices on the downside, and generate differentiated performance on the upside, given our concentrated portfolio of investments.

Net revenue growth for and Nifty500 companies was 10.2% and 9.9% year-over-year (YoY) respectively, fueled by strong credit demand and robust auto sales. These sectors contributed 76% and 73% to the overall revenue growth of Nifty50 and Nifty500 companies.

For the entire fiscal year, however, the growth was more subdued, with net revenue increasing by 9.3% for Nifty50 and 7.9% for Nifty500 companies, a significant drop from the previous year's growth rates of 23% and 29.6%. Despite this, operating profit growth outpaced revenue growth, with Nifty50 and Nifty500 companies seeing increases of 10.7% and 12.2% YoY respectively. This was achieved despite higher salaries and other operating expenses, leading to substantial margin improvements.

Adjusted net profit (PAT) growth was particularly strong in Q4FY24, with Nifty50 companies experiencing a 21.5% rise and Nifty500 companies seeing a 17.9% increase. Over the full fiscal year, PAT growth for Nifty50 was 27%, while Nifty500 saw a 33% increase. Notably, Financials and Consumer Discretionary sectors were major contributors, accounting for 90% of the earnings growth in both indices. Excluding these sectors, PAT growth was modest at 3.4% for Nifty50 and 2.9% for Nifty500 in Q4FY24.

Export-oriented sectors such as Information Technology and commodity companies in Materials and Energy faced challenges due to weak external demand. Consumer Staples also struggled with lagging rural demand. In contrast, domestic cyclical sectors like Financials, Industrials, and Consumer Discretionary drove overall earnings, supported by resilient urban consumption, government capital expenditure, and improving private investment.

Looking forward, consensus earnings estimates for the top 200 companies by market capitalization show modest increases of 0.1% for FY25 and 2.3% for FY26 since March 2024. This implies expected profit growth of 10.9% in FY25 and 16.7% in FY26, following a robust 34.5% growth in FY24. Financials and Materials are projected to contribute nearly 52% of the incremental earnings for these companies over the next two years, despite comprising only 38.4% of overall corporate earnings in FY24.

The earnings growth outlook for FY25 is supported by resilient urban demand, a recovery in rural demand amid expectations of a normal monsoon, an improvement in external demand with the easing cycle, and sustained government capital expenditure. However, rising input costs could partially offset these positive factors.

Overall, the Q4FY24 earnings review underscores the critical role of Financials and Consumer Discretionary sectors in driving corporate profitability, while highlighting the challenges and potential headwinds facing other sectors. As companies navigate these dynamics, continued strong performance in key sectors will be crucial for sustaining overall growth.

The market has further extended its short-term consolidation following a retreat from last Thursday’s new record high of 5,505.53. Today, the index is likely to open 0.4% higher, as indicated by futures contracts. The Core PCE Price Index release has been as expected at +0.1% month over month. The S&P 500 remains relatively close to record highs, and for now, it only looks like a relatively flat correction of the uptrend.

In my forecast for June, I wrote:

“For the last three months, the S&P 500 index has been fluctuating along new record highs, above the 5,000 level which was broken in February. It looks like a consolidation within a long-term uptrend, but it may also be a topping pattern before some meaningful medium-term correction. What is it likely to do? As the saying goes, 'the trend is your friend', so the most likely scenario is more advances in the future. However, a negative signal would be a breakdown below the 5,000 level. That would raise the question of a deeper correction and downward reversal. I think that the likelihood of a bullish scenario is 60/40 - a downward reversal cannot be completely ruled out. The market will be waiting for more signals from the Fed about potential interest rate easing, plus, at the end of the month, the coming earnings season may dictate the market moves.”

The investor sentiment remained basically unchanged on Wednesday, as indicated by the AAII Investor Sentiment Survey, which showed that 44.5% of individual investors are bullish, while 28.3% of them are bearish (up from last week's reading of 22.5%). The AAII sentiment is a contrary indicator in the sense that highly bullish readings may suggest excessive complacency and a lack of fear in the market. Conversely, bearish readings are favorable for market upturns.

The S&P 500 index continues sideways after breaking its upward trend line, as we can see on the daily chart.

Nasdaq 100 Extends Its Rebound

Last Thursday, the technology-focused reached a new record high of 19,979.93, before retracing the advance and closing lower. On Friday and Monday, the market traded lower, but since Tuesday, it has been rebounding, reaching as high as 19,850 yesterday. This morning, the Nasdaq 100 is poised to open 0.5% higher, getting closer to the record high from last week.

VIX Gets Closer to 12

The , also known as the fear gauge, is derived from option prices. In late May, it set a new medium-term low of 11.52 before rebounding up to around 15 on correction worries. Since last Thursday, it has been closing above the 13 level, showing increasing fear in the market. Since Tuesday, the VIX is closing closed below 13 on hopes that a correction in stocks may be ending. Yesterday, it went closer to the 12 level.

Historically, a dropping VIX indicates less fear in the market, and rising VIX accompanies stock market downturns. However, the lower the VIX, the higher the probability of the market’s downward reversal.

Futures Contract Trades Above 5,550

Let’s take a look at the hourly chart of the contract. Last Thursday, it reached a new high of around 5,588. Since then, the market has been fluctuating, reaching the support level at around 5,520. This morning, it is trading higher, yet still below the recent high.

Conclusion

The S&P 500 index is likely to open 0.3% higher today. For a few sessions, the market continued trading sideways after last Thursday’s intraday retreat, and today, it may attempt to get closer to the record. The recent trading action is best described as a flat correction of the uptrend.

For now, my short-term outlook remains neutral.

Here’s the breakdown:

The S&P 500 reversed lower from a new record high on Thursday; this week, it kept extending a consolidation.

Recently, stock prices were reaching new record highs despite mixed data and growing uncertainty.

In my opinion, the short-term outlook is neutral.","The S&P 500 remains relatively close to record highs, and for now, it only looks like a relatively flat correction of the uptrend.

Dot-Com Crash: Here's Why History Won't Rhyme This Time,"Don't fear the bubble talk: Data suggests the AI rally is different from the dot-com boom.

Mega-cap tech leads the market, but history shows this doesn't signal a crash.

While some worry about narrow leadership, the current market performance actually aligns with history.

Concerns about a market bubble often overshadow important data. Comparing Nvidia's (NASDAQ: ) position with Cisco's (NASDAQ: ) during the dotcom era provides clarity on why today’s tech valuations are not as alarming.

Cisco's peak forward P/E ratio soared to 131 in March 2000, while Nvidia's current forward P/E stands at a much lower 45. Although Nvidia isn't cheap, its valuation is far from the extreme levels Cisco reached in 2000, and it's also well below Microsoft's (NASDAQ: ) P/E in 1999.

Nvidia's historical performance does not imply an inevitable collapse. It's crucial to understand that Nvidia does not have to follow the same trajectory as Cisco did over two decades ago.

The comparison of their P/E ratios highlights significant differences: Nvidia and Cisco are fundamentally different companies with distinct market contexts.

Mega-Cap Tech Leads, But History Suggests No Crash

The focus often falls on large-cap and mega-cap tech stocks driving the current bull market. This automatically puts them on the overvalued list, right? Not necessarily.

Historically, these giants have frequently led rallies, and it doesn't signal an inevitable crash.

The data confirms this. The top 10 stocks currently trade at a P/E of 30x, compared to 47x for the top 10 in the 2000s. When you exclude the top 10, the remaining 490 stocks in the S&P 500 today trade at a P/E of 18x, versus 16x in 2000.

Few Stocks Posting the Bulk of Gains: Is That Really a Concern?

There's also chatter about narrow leadership in the market. Let's delve deeper. While 8% of the S&P 500 have returned over 30% year-to-date (YTD), it's not just the usual suspects.

This impressive performance comes from a broader group of 40 stocks, not just the frequently mentioned 7.

The current 8% of S&P 500 stocks performing above 30% is actually in line with historical averages – slightly lower than the 10% average since 1990. This suggests that 2024 might be a typical year historically, and not an outlier.

A Very Strong H2 2024 Lies Ahead for Stocks

Last year, the S&P 500 returned almost 25%, and this year it's around +15% so far, which is notable given that election years typically see stronger performance later in the year.

The chart below shows the current trend remains above average, but it's important to consider that election years tend to be positive, with the stock market performing well from mid-May to September. Could this be a hint of a summer rally?

June might be ending with the S&P 500 close to a 4% gain. Notably, the worst day this month saw a mere 0.31% drop early in the week. Additionally, there haven't been any daily declines of 2% in quite some time.

The last time the market saw a daily drop exceeding 2% was February 2023. This translates to 338 consecutive trading days without such a decline, significantly higher than the typical 29 days.

While this might suggest some expected volatility, it's important to keep things in perspective – the current streak is only a third of the longest ever recorded (949 days).

Looking ahead, July has historically been a strong month for the S&P 500, with gains in 9 consecutive years and 11 of the last 12.

Over the past 20 years, July’s average return exceeds 2.5%. Given the positive trend during election years, the market could continue its uptrend through the summer months.

They first pointed out that the outcome of the first round of the French legislative elections, held last weekend, does not easily allow for predicting the results of the second round.

With a participation rate of 65.8%, the highest since 1997, preliminary results show significant gains for parties at both extremes of the political spectrum. Exit polls place the National Rally (RN) in the lead with 33.2%, followed by the New Popular Front (NFP) with 28.1%, and Macron's Ensemble alliance with 21%.

UBS highlights that one of the most notable features of this first round is the high number of three-candidate races in the second round. For the first time since 1958, more than 250 constituencies will see three candidates compete, adding further complexity to predicting the final results.

UBS analysts believe that this situation could lead to a period of political instability in France. According to their forecasts, it is likely that no party will obtain an absolute majority in the National Assembly, which could result in a minority government or an assembly without a clear majority, making it difficult to pass any legislation.

More specifically, the UBS report identifies three possible scenarios:

A minority government led by the RN with limited legislative power.

A hung parliament, leading to a political deadlock and a government composed of moderate parties.

A minority government led by the NFP, also with limited legislative power.

In terms of the market reaction, UBS already observes increased nervousness. Sovereign bond yield spreads have widened, and French stocks have underperformed compared to other European markets. Since June 7, French stock indices have dropped by 6.5% for large caps ( ) and 12% for small caps (MSCI Small Caps index), while European indices ( ) have fallen by 3%.

In this context, UBS advises investors not to make drastic changes to their portfolio strategy based on political events. Instead, they recommend maintaining adequate diversification and considering structured investments with capital protection or yield generation features.

In summary, UBS analysts warn that uncertainty surrounding the second round of the French legislative elections could continue to weigh on the performance of French and European financial markets.","Investing.com - As the markets digest the results of the first round of the French legislative elections, UBS analysts have examined possible scenarios for the second round in a note published this Monday.

(Reuters) - When Republican campaigns want a banker, they don't go to New York or San Francisco, but to downtown McLean, Virginia - about a 20 minute drive from the White House, where a one-branch bank next to an auto repair shop has beaten bigger financial rivals to become a must-have partner for political work.

Chain Bridge Bank, privately owned and with some 70 employees, has worked with the campaign of every Republican Party presidential nominee since John McCain in 2008, including Donald Trump.

For almost two decades the bank founded by former Republican U.S. Senator Peter Fitzgerald has quietly built its position by catering to politics, where large sums shift at short notice and bankers are always on call. Its business model, and the group it serves, could face more scrutiny after the bank said in May it was considering going public.

""In the U.S., federal politics is a $20 billion dollar industry and a couple of financial institutions have appealed and marketed themselves to these entities,"" said Daniel Weiner, a director at the Brennan Center for Justice.

""Part of it is that the environment is a little Wild West but part of it is that it is a rather insular community, people work by word of mouth.""

Reuters reviewed campaign documents filed with the Federal Election Commission going back to 2007 and spoke to Chain Bridge's management and customers before its initial public offering plans were announced, to learn how it came to dominate the market for Republican political campaigns.

As recently as 2016, top Republican presidential contenders Ted Cruz and Marco Rubio banked at BB&T - a sprawling North Carolina-based lender that was merged into Truist Financial (NYSE: ).

But in the 2024 election cycle, where Republicans have already raised over $1 billion, every major Republican presidential candidate, including former South Carolina Governor Nikki Haley and Florida Governor Ron DeSantis, was a Chain Bridge customer.

The Republican National Committee, the party's main coordinating body, has been a customer since 2008, although it also has accounts with Truist Financial.

The bank has been so successful because it meets the oddball needs of political campaigns in a way no competitor does, according to Bradley Crate, treasurer for Trump's 2024 and 2020 campaigns and head of political consultancy Red Curve Solutions.

""We don't have time to wait for people's lunch breaks,"" he told Reuters. ""If there's an issue at a large bank, I'm not going to be able to call the head of the bank to figure it out.""

New accounts at Chain Bridge take minutes to open, even at short notice. Crate, who has opened more than 1,200 accounts at the bank for clients, once set up new accounts in 15 minutes on a Sunday.

All big depositors are assigned a representative and Crate has called his as late as 11:00 pm. If that doesn't work, he also has the chairman's number.

The bank has also lent money to campaigns. During Mitt Romney's 2012 campaign the bank made a loan against donations which had come in but could not be spent until after the Republican National Convention, when Romney officially became the party's nominee, according to Crate.

Campaigns rushing to pay for last-minute advertisements or events can rely on the bank processing transfers right up until the Federal Reserve stops accepting requests at 6:45 pm.

""When larger banks close their wire at 3:00 pm and someone contacts us at 4:30 pm and they need payment for an event tomorrow, we have to FedEx (NYSE: ) a check, which is silly,"" Crate said.

Chain Bridge's political customers extend beyond Republican circles. The pro-Israel United Democracy Project super PAC (political action committee) and tobacco company Altria (NYSE: )'s corporate PAC are customers, electoral filings show. The US Chamber of Commerce PAC is as well.

The 2024 election campaign for Republican Mike Johnson added Chain Bridge Bank to its paperwork for the first time within three weeks of his election as House speaker on Oct 25.

""We're like Tesla (NASDAQ: ),"" Fitzgerald, who is also Chain Bridge's chairman, said in an interview with Reuters in January, referencing the electric vehicle maker that for years eschewed traditional advertising.

""We have a marketing budget that's essentially zero and we've grown by word of mouth.""

FRIENDS WITH MCCAIN

Fitzgerald's own background in politics was integral to the bank's growth. A Republican from Illinois, he launched the bank in 2007, after retiring from the U.S. Senate two years earlier. His seat was won by former U.S. President Barack Obama.

Fitzgerald says Senator John McCain, who he called a close friend, became the bank's first major political client in 2008 when his campaign needed a new bank after pulling money from Wachovia, which was hit hard by the 2008 banking crisis.

""They were very nervous,"" Fitzgerald said. ""They switched to us because we had the cleanest balance sheet.""

Electoral filings show Chain Bridge joined the McCain campaign in April 2008 as one of four banks, including Wachovia.

Money has poured into politics since then, in large part due to the 2010 Supreme Court Citizens United decision which relaxed rules around campaign finance.

Republican candidates for president and Congress raised $2.6 billion in 2020, according to the Federal Election Commission, a two-thirds jump from 2016. Those figures do not include money raised by third party groups like super PACs.

Today, Chain Bridge wins a ""substantial"" portion of political campaign work, according to Fitzgerald, although it is no monopoly. Electoral filings show the Charles Koch-backed Americans for Prosperity PAC, which backed Haley's campaign, banked with Truist Financial.

Lobbying committees for oil giant Exxon Mobil (NYSE: ) and Pfizer (NYSE: ) bank with Citibank and Bank of America, respectively, while Google (NASDAQ: ) opts for Wells Fargo, according to electoral filings.

Democrats also have a favored bank. Biden's campaign banks with the partly union-owned and publicly-listed Amalgamated Bank (NASDAQ: ), as did Obama and 2016 presidential nominee Hillary Clinton before him.

ROLLER COASTER BALANCE SHEET

Chain Bridge's balance sheet moves to a political rhythm. Deposits rise through the election campaign period and then crater as politicians spend furiously in the finishing stretch. Deposits fell 21% after the November 2020 election. After the mid terms in 2022 they dropped 25%.

Faced with the equivalent of a small bank run every two years, Chain Bridge is a conservative lender. It has had no non-performing loans in twelve years, according to its annual report. Roughly three quarters of its $1.2 billion in assets at the end of 2023 were investment grade securities or cash.

While it remains to be seen what sort of welcome the bank will get from the stock market, customers will keep coming as long as it maintains its customer service culture, says Crate.

""We've banked at larger banks - Bank of America, JP Morgan, things of that nature - and we just don't get the same experience,"" he said. ""It makes it really hard to go anywhere else.""","Chain Bridge Bank, privately owned and with some 70 employees, has worked with the campaign of every Republican Party presidential nominee since John McCain in 2008, including Donald Trump.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. Supreme Court's conservative majority trained its legal firepower this term on curbing federal regulatory authority, cementing its critical role in a longstanding effort by business interests and others to defang the ""administrative state.""

The court's sweeping rulings have limited the federal government's power to regulate everything from stock trading to pollution, even as the justices opted not to further curtail abortion rights or expand gun rights under the U.S. Constitution's Second Amendment ahead of the Nov. 5 presidential election.

The court's nine-month term comes to an end on Monday. It issued a major ruling on Friday, with its six conservative justices in the majority and three liberals in dissent, that overturned a 1984 precedent that established an important principle in administrative law known as "" Chevron (NYSE: ) deference."" The doctrine had called on courts to give deference to government agency interpretations of federal law.

The outcome - eagerly sought by business and conservative groups - will make it easier for judges to second-guess actions by U.S. agencies, empowering legal challenges to regulations in the federal sphere such as air and water quality, food and drug safety, employment standards and investor protection.

On Thursday, the conservative majority ruled that enforcement actions seeking penalties for fraud that are handled in-house by the Securities and Exchange Commission instead of in federal courts violate the Constitution's Seventh Amendment right to a jury trial. The ruling could reverberate through other agencies, frustrating their enforcement of regulations as well.

""I would say that this area of the law is the clearest one today where there is a 6-3 divide among the justices of the court,"" said attorney Misha Tseytlin, who has argued cases at the court.

Friday's Chevron deference ruling ""is the most significant administrative law decision in decades from the U.S. Supreme Court,"" Tseytlin added. ""That decision will fundamentally change not only litigation over agency rules, but also the manner in which agencies approach their rulemaking processes.""

The court has pared back agency power in other cases in recent years, including curbing the authority of the Environmental Protection Agency to reduce carbon emissions from power plants in 2022. In that one, the court embraced the so-called ""major questions"" doctrine favored by conservatives, giving judges broad discretion to invalidate executive branch actions unless Congress clearly authorized them.

The conservative majority has ""continued to make limiting the power of administrative agencies one of its highest priorities,"" said Nicole Saharsky, also a Supreme Court litigator.

""From the major questions doctrine, to limits on agencies' power to adjudicate, to the elimination of Chevron deference, the court has made it much easier for regulated parties to challenge agency actions,"" Saharsky added.

Legal scholars debated how far the rulings undermined the power of regulatory agencies.

Abner Greene, a Fordham University School of Law expert in regulatory law, said the court has taken ""another step toward dismantling the federal regulatory state"" by limiting the ability of Congress to use agencies to ""develop federal policy over time and in response to complex circumstances.""

George Mason University law professor Ilya Somin, however, said that while it is clear the justices have ""suspicion of regulatory bureaucracies"" they are ""very far from destroying the administrative state or even ending all judicial deference to it.""

The court upheld in May the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau's funding mechanism in a challenge brought by the payday loan industry that represented an existential threat to the agency. The justices are expected on Monday to decide one more case involving a North Dakota convenience store's challenge to debit card ""swipe fee"" regulation issued by the U.S. Federal Reserve.

GUNS AND ABORTION

Two major cases on their docket gave the court's conservatives the chance to further curtail access to abortion. The justices declined to do so - but also did not resolve the underlying legal questions, leaving the door open for those issues to return to the Supreme Court in the future.

One case involved a bid by anti-abortion groups and doctors to restrict access to the abortion pill. The justices decided that these particular challengers lacked the necessary legal standing to pursue the case. The court also declined to decide another matter involving the enforcement of Idaho's strict abortion ban in medical emergencies, instead dismissing the case.

The court's conservative majority in 2022 overturned the 1973 Roe v. Wade landmark that had recognized a constitutional right to abortion and legalized the procedure nationwide.

The justices also this term declined to further expand gun rights under the Constitution's Second Amendment right to ""keep and bear arms"" in a case involving a challenge to a federal law that bans domestic abusers from having guns.

The ruling suggested limits to the new test the court had announced in a 2022 ruling that made it easier to challenge gun control measures, requiring them to be consistent with the nation's ""historical tradition of firearm regulation.""

Somin said the term's abortion cases show that for many of the conservative justices ""it's clear it's not necessarily their view that they want to restrict abortion at all costs.""

He also noted that in the domestic abuse gun case, the challenger was not a sympathetic figure. ""The conservative justices were reluctant to say the right goes as far as to even cover this case, but that doesn't tell us much about what they would do in less extreme cases,"" Somin said.

In another gun-related case that did not involve the Second Amendment, the court declared unlawful a federal regulation banning ""bump stock"" devices that enable semiautomatic weapons to fire rapidly like machine guns, suggesting instead that Congress step in.

The court already has another firearms-related case set for review during its next term, which begins in October, involving a challenge to a federal regulation targeting homemade ""ghost guns."" It could take up, as early as Monday, other Second Amendment challenges to bans on gun possession by non-violent felons and users of illegal drugs, and on assault-type rifles.

In another major case set for next term, the justices are set to decide the legality of Republican-backed state bans on gender-affirming medical care for transgender minors in a case involving a state law in Tennessee.","By Andrew ChungWASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. Supreme Court's conservative majority trained its legal firepower this term on curbing federal regulatory authority, cementing its critical role in a longstanding effort by business interests and others to defang the ""administrative state.""

Additionally, Fed Chair is to make an appearance at the European Central Bank’s annual forum in Sintra, Portugal on Tuesday, while Wednesday’s of the Fed’s June meeting will be parsed for the central bank’s view of the economic outlook and the factors influencing the monetary policy outlook.

2. EU to charge Meta Platforms - FT

The European Union is set to charge Meta Platforms (NASDAQ: ) with breaking the bloc's digital rules, according to a report by the Financial Times, released Monday.

The newspaper reported that the regulators will say that they are worried about Meta's ""pay or consent"" model, noting that this choice provides a false alternative, with the financial barrier forcing them to consent to their personal data being tracked for advertising purposes.

The EU’s Digital Markets Act was designed to rein in the power of the 'Big Tech' firms and ensure a level playing field for smaller rivals, and saw the region’s regulators last week charging Apple (NASDAQ: ) with breaching the bloc's tech rules.

3. Boeing to buy Spirit Aerospace, finally…

Boeing (NYSE: ) announced Monday that it would buy Spirit AeroSystems (NYSE: ) in a $4.7 billion all-stock deal, with the planemaker finally agreeing a deal for the key supplier after months of talks complicated by Spirit’s interactions with Boeing’s main rival Airbus.

Boeing’s move to take back control of Spirit stems from a desire to resolve the quality problems that have plagued the key supplier in recent years.

The total deal value will be about $8.3 billion including debt, and followed Boeing's decision to buy back its former subsidiary, which had branched out into supplying Airbus (EPA: ) and others since becoming independent almost two decades ago.

Airbus said it would receive $559 million in compensation from Spirit, and would take over core activities at four of the supplier's plants in the United States, Northern Ireland, France and Morocco.

Spirit said it also planned to sell businesses and operations in Scotland and Malaysia that support Airbus programs. It also plans to sell operations in Belfast, Northern Ireland that do not support Airbus programs.

4. National Rally prevails in French elections

France's far-right National Rally party and its allies reached 33% of the national popular vote in the first round of parliamentary elections, the interior ministry said, after Sunday’s vote.

The leftwing New Popular Front came in second with 28%, while President Emmanuel Macron's centrist bloc reached 20%.

This result has seen the euro bounce, with the single currency touching a two-week high, while the , the French benchmark equity index, traded higher, rebounding after losses of around 6% since French President Emmanuel Macron dissolved parliament.

At 04:20 ET (08:20 GMT), traded 0.4% higher at 1.0758, while the rose 1.9%.

Investors have been concerned that the far-right, as well as the left-wing alliance, have pledged big spending increases at a time when France's high budget deficit has prompted the EU to recommend disciplinary steps.

However, this result was better than feared, but also suggests more volatility this week ahead of next Sunday's runoff with the final outcome likely to depend on alliance-building.

5. China’s private PMI helps crude prices

The Chinese economy showed signs of growth in June, helping crude prices rise Monday on hope that the world’s largest importer can benefit from the solid momentum in the global economy.

China's (PMI), a private survey, rose to 51.8 in June from 51.7 in May earlier Monday, growing at the fastest clip in more than three years, above the break-even line of 50.0 that separates growth from contraction.

This positive result has boosted sentiment after official PMI data released on Sunday showed fell for a second month in June and services activity slid to a five-month low.

By 08:20 ET, the futures (WTI) traded 0.9% higher at $82.27 a barrel, while the contract climbed 0.8% to $85.70 per barrel.

Both contracts gained around 6% in June, after the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries and their allies, a group known as OPEC+, extended most of its deep oil output cuts well into 2025.","Investing.com -- Wall Street looks set to start the new week and quarter on a positive note ahead of Friday’s crucial payrolls report.

LONDON (Reuters) -The Bank for International Settlements warned on Sunday that rising government debt levels amid a number of major elections this year could roil global financial markets.

Dubbed the central bankers' central bank, the BIS said the world economy was on course for the ""smooth landing"" that many economists doubted when interest rates shot up, but said policymakers, especially politicians, needed to be careful.

Global government debt is already at record levels and elections ranging from the U.S. presidential vote in November, through recent polls in Mexico and South Africa, to votes in France and Britain in the coming week, all carry risks.

BIS General Manager Agustin Carstens said with interest rates not about to go back to ultra-low levels, and cost pressures from aging populations, climate change and rebuilding defence capabilities, economic stimulus plans and a general rise in protectionism could unsettle sensitive markets.

""They can surprise you with not much notice,"" Carstens told reporters as the BIS published its annual report, pointing to the turbulence in Britain's markets following then Prime Minister Liz Truss' budget plans which put some pension funds at risk of collapse. ""You really want to avoid that.""

As well as persistent concerns over U.S. debt levels, the French debt risk premium has surged this month to its highest level since the euro zone crisis in 2012, after French President Emmanuel Macron called a snap parliamentary election being held on Sunday that could bring in a far right government.

Carstens said the BIS was not calling out any ""one or two"" governments but that the message was clear.

""They (governments) must cut short the rise in public debt and accept that interest rates may not return to the pre-pandemic ultra low levels,"" he said. ""We need a solid foundation to build upon"".

MUCH BETTER PLACE

The positive, however, is that central banks are successfully reining in inflation that had hit decades-long highs after the COVID-19 pandemic, and then Russia's 2022 invasion of Ukraine, which riled commodity markets.

""Compared to last year, I have to say we are in a much better place,"" the former Mexican central bank governor said.

Although Carstens said central banks deserved praise for navigating a difficult path that could have resulted in a wave of recessions, he added they needed to persevere, likening the inflation fight to a course of antibiotics to tackle an illness.

He described an ""extreme"" scenario where inflation races up again and central banks need to raise rates further. But that is not what the BIS expects.

Some things will be key, however, including goods and services prices, which, relative to core goods, remain well below the pre-pandemic trend in many countries. Real wages relative to the cost of those goods and services have also lost ground during the surge in inflation.

""An overly rapid reversion of either – or both – of these relative prices could create material inflationary pressures"", Carstens said, adding it would mean ""fewer and more gradual rate cuts or even, in the extreme, rate increases.""

It chimed with the view that rate cuts should not be rushed.

""A premature easing could reignite inflationary pressures and force a costly policy reversal,"" the BIS report said.","By Marc JonesLONDON (Reuters) -The Bank for International Settlements warned on Sunday that rising government debt levels amid a number of major elections this year could roil global financial markets.

Revisions to the draft bill underwent the second round of review by China's top legislature, the National People's Congress (NPC) standing committee, and are open for public feedback until July 27th, according to a post on the NPC website.

The bill aims to establish a comprehensive cross-agency mechanism for risk detection and mitigation within the financial system, as the country grapples with a prolonged real estate crisis and vulnerabilities in smaller banks.

The top legislature usually passes bills after three rounds of reviews.

The latest revisions stipulate that financial regulators and local governments should fulfill the responsibilities of preventing, defusing and handling financial risks, and should prevent and investigate illegal financial activities.

Establishment of a financial institution and engagement in financial business activities must be approved by government financial departments, it said.

The draft also removed provisions about responsibilities of the Financial Stability and Development Committee (FSDC), under the State Council. It said a central financial work leading body, which it did not identify, would be responsible for decision-making, top-level design, supervision of implementation of financial stability and development policies.

The FSDC was dissolved and its functions transferred to the new Central Financial Commission (CFC) in March 2023 as part of a broader reorganisation of government and party institutions.

China's financial system faces multiple challenges as the country's economic recovery loses steam amid a sluggish property market and increasing financial stress on already heavily indebted local governments.

The long-awaited bill underwent its first review in December 2022 and said a financial stability fund would be set up to tackle major systemic risks.

The latest revisions also follow the ""spirit"" of a key gathering Central Financial Work Conference in October, which said China will comprehensively strengthen financial supervision and resolve financial risks, according to the NPC post.","BEIJING (Reuters) - China's new financial stability law draft bill improved provisions on financial risks prevention and control, according to draft revisions released on Monday.

England, currently joint favourite with France, along with hosts Germany, are through to the quarter finals of the Euros. But the excitement is not just on the football pitch, or the polling booths. The coming week also brings the market's favourite data point - U.S. monthly employment figures.

Here is your look at what matters for markets in the coming week from Lewis Krauskopf in New York, Rae Wee in Singapore, Yoruk Bahceli in Amsterdam and Andres Gonzalez and Naomi Rovnick in London.

1/JOBS DAY

Investors assessing when the Federal Reserve could start to cut interest rates will get a critical economic datapoint with the monthly U.S. jobs report released on July 5.

Economists are forecasting an increase of 180,000 jobs for the month of June. For May, non-farm payrolls increased by 272,000, far more than expected, underscoring the resilience of the labour market.

The Federal Reserve held rates steady this month and pushed out the start of rate cuts to perhaps as late as December, as officials look for more convincing signs that inflation is moderating to the central bank's target, or evidence that the employment market is worsening.

The latest consumer price index report showed U.S. consumer prices were unexpectedly unchanged in May.

2/FRENCH VOTE

Marine Le Pen's far-right National Rally (RN) party scored historic gains to win the first round of France's parliamentary election on Sunday, exit polls showed, but the final result will depend on days of horsetrading before next week's run-off.

Investors are unlikely to get much more clarity before the results of the second round vote on July 7. But a 577-constituency race where candidates just need 12.5% of the vote to make it to the second round, also featuring three-way races, means uncertainty may prevail.

Market jitters over fears of a spending surge have stabilised, helped by a signals from Marine Le Pen's far-right National Rally (RN), leading the polls, that it would be fiscally responsible.

Yet they are far from recovery. The closely-watched risk premium French bonds pay over Germany's is still over 25 basis points higher than before the election announcement. French bank stocks are sitting on double-digit losses.

Another worry for markets has been the left-wing alliance polling second, which many in the market now see as a bigger threat than the RN.

3/A MIXED M&A BAG

Global M&A volumes in the first half of 2024 have seen an uptick of 20% compared with 2023, and deals exceeding $5 billion have surged by 53%, according to data provided by Dealogic.

But for some dealmakers the glass is only half full.

Despite the recovery, deal volumes as of June 24 remain 15% below the last decade's average, largely impacted by the slowest Q2 in the Asia-Pacific region since 2009.

The number of deals announced in Q2, 2024 is the lowest of the past 16 years, even worse than in Q2, 2020, when COVID-19 forced a worldwide pause in M&A activity.

The remainder of the year looks bleak, with upcoming elections in France, Britain, and particularly in the U.S. causing corporate boards and private equity funds to reconsider their decisions.

Some investment bankers are wondering whether they should focus on 2025 instead, a year they finally hope will deliver the goods.

4/BRITISH BLUES

Polls predict a landslide British election win for the opposition Labour Party on July 4, boosting UK stocks and government bonds, as trade-weighted sterling has bounced back to levels not seen since 2016's Brexit vote.

Traders see a return to stability after heavy political turbulence during the Conservatives' 14-year rule and have speculated Labour leader Keir Starmer will rebuild trade links with Europe.

But Britain has vast fiscal challenges that neither Labour nor the Conservatives have clarified how they would solve, the Institute for Fiscal Studies think-tank said.

Economic growth is tepid, public debt-to-GDP has hit a 63-year high and taxation as a share of national income is approaching its highest since 1949.

If voters expect better public services without tax hikes and investors want government borrowing to stabilise, Starmer could find it tough to keep both sets of stakeholders on side.

5/STAND-OFF

Inflation readings across countries in emerging Asia scatter the data calendar, though with consumer prices seemingly coming to heel for most economies it begs the question of how much longer policymakers will need to keep rates higher for.

Yet their hands are tied, with a foot-dragging Federal Reserve and a towering dollar leaving little to no room for any imminent rate cuts in Asia.

It's that or running the risk of their currencies getting hammered further.

In Thailand, that dissonance has sparked a months-long spat between the central bank and government.

The latter insists an urgent rate cut would revive Southeast Asia's second-largest economy, while the Bank of Thailand (BOT) has said rates remain appropriate.

BOT Governor Sethaput Suthiwartnarueput speaks to the media on Thursday, and will likely reiterate the central bank's stance.","England, currently joint favourite with France, along with hosts Germany, are through to the quarter finals of the Euros.

LONDON (Reuters) -The winners of Britain's election on Thursday - which looks set to end 14 years in power for the Conservative Party - will take on some of the biggest challenges faced by any new government since the end of World War Two.

The economy has struggled to grow, health and other services are under severe strain and there is little room in the public finances to fix them. The government is also lagging behind its targets for immigration and house-building.

Opinion polls give a large lead to Keir Starmer's opposition Labour Party over Prime Minister Rishi Sunak's Conservatives. The graphics below highlight some of the main tasks ahead for the next government.

A web-based version of the story is available here.

ECONOMY

Britain, like many other rich nations, has managed only sluggish economic growth for most of the period after the global financial crisis of 2008-09.

Growth in Britain since 2010 - when the Conservatives took power - has been stronger than in Germany, France or Italy. But the lead is marginal.

Taking account of changing population numbers - which have risen sharply in Britain due to high immigration - growth since 2010 has been weaker than in Germany and lags far behind the United States.

Living standards are on course to suffer their first fall over the course of a parliament since the 1950s.

Sunak says the economy is turning a corner after COVID and the energy price surge. Starmer says Labour would deliver the strongest sustained growth among the Group of Seven nations.

Since the COVID pandemic, Britain's economy has been the second weakest in the G7.

POVERTY

Poverty has continued to diminish but the pace of the improvement has slowed since 2010.

Absolute poverty - measuring people on incomes below 60% of the median - fell five times faster in the 13 years to the 2009/10 financial year than it has since then, the Institute for Fiscal Studies, a think tank, says.

Other gauges of hardship have worsened recently, showing the impact of high inflation on poorer households more clearly.

In 2019/20, 4% of working-age adults were unable to heat their homes adequately. Three years later, that share had risen to 11%, according to the IFS.

IMMIGRATION

Successive Conservative governments missed their targets to lower net migration, even after Britain left the European Union and scrapped freedom of movement for workers from the bloc.

More workers from EU countries are now leaving Britain than arriving, but the number of people coming from other countries - especially India and Nigeria - has increased sharply.

Net migration fell to 685,000 in 2023 from a record 764,000 in 2022 but is almost four times its level in 2019 when former Conservative leader Boris Johnson promised, before an election that year, to bring it down.

INACTIVITY

One of the reasons immigration has risen so much is a shortage of workers.

Employers have struggled to fill vacancies since the pandemic as the number of people classed as having long-term sickness hit record highs and the number of students also grew.

Britain is the only country in the G7 where the inactivity rate - measuring working-age people who are neither employed nor seeking a job - is higher than before the coronavirus pandemic.

The Conservatives plan to tighten rules on long-term sickness welfare benefits. Labour says it will address the problem by investing more in Britain's health service.

HEALTH

The health service is struggling. The number of people waiting for non-urgent treatment, which was already growing between 2010 and early 2020, surged after COVID struck and then hit almost 8 million in late 2023 in England alone, almost doubling from four years earlier.

The backlog has fallen slightly in recent months but the National Health Service is far behind a target to start treating almost all non-urgent patients within 18 weeks. It is also missing its target for treating emergency patients promptly.

Since 2010, health spending adjusted for inflation has grown more slowly than the average increases seen since the 1950s at a time when the population is growing and ageing.

HOME-BUILDING

Another promise that the Conservatives look set to miss is to increase construction of new homes after running into opposition to their plans to make it easier to build.

In the 12 months to the end of March 2023, just over 234,000 new homes were built in England and the figure has been persistently below the 300,000 target set for the mid-2020s.

Housing in Britain offers the worst value for money of any comparable economy, the Resolution Foundation think-tank says.

PRODUCTIVITY AND INVESTMENT

Key to the next government's chances of addressing many of Britain's most pressing challenges will be its ability to speed up economic growth which would put more money in the pockets of households and in the public coffers.

To do that, an improvement in weak productivity will be needed. London and southeast England are the only regions in the UK where output per hour is above the national average, although the capital saw its lead narrow after the pandemic, possibly reflecting the impact of increased home-working.

More private-sector investment is needed but companies have been wary about investing since 2016, the year of the Brexit referendum which triggered years of political instability.","The economy has struggled to grow, health and other services are under severe strain and there is little room in the public finances to fix them.

Dechert has more than 20 employees in its Hong Kong office, 14 of whom are lawyers, including four partners, according to its website and one of the people. Its Beijing office houses only three lawyers, as per the website.

There are no other China offices listed on the global law firm's website.

Some of the impacted employees were notified earlier this month about a potential office closure, said the people, who have knowledge of the matter but declined to be identified as they are not authorised to speak to the media.

The firm, which has about 1,000 lawyers globally, has since been in discussions with several employees in Hong Kong and Beijing, in particular lawyers, about a potential relocation to Singapore, said one of the people.

If the move from China is finalised, Dechert's Asia footprint will be limited to Singapore, which has 14 lawyers including six partners.

It was not immediately clear what would be the effective date of closure of the offices, and whether the firm has started notifying its clients about the move.

Dechert representatives in the U.S. did not respond to Reuters requests for comment.

The move comes as a growing number of U.S. and other global law firms have been rethinking or reducing their presence in China amid growing pressures on foreign businesses, economic uncertainties, muted deal activities, and geopolitical tensions.

New government rules on data privacy and cybersecurity were among the reasons cited by Dentons last year when the global law firm ended its combination with China's Dacheng, an 8,000-lawyer firm.

Several other large U.S. law firms have also announced closures of some of their China offices or scaled down their offerings in the world's second-largest economy since last year.

DARKENING PROSPECTS

Morrison & Foerster said last week that it is winding down its Beijing office as its lease there ends later this year. It said most of its work in China is already being handled by lawyers in Shanghai, Hong Kong and elsewhere.

Sidley Austin said in May that it will shutter its Shanghai office, relocate staff and consolidate its China operations in Hong Kong and Beijing by September.

Dechert's gross global revenues grew by just 0.4% to $1.294 billion last year, while profits per equity partner sank 1.2% year-on-year at the firm, according to The American Lawyer magazine.

Dechert said in May last year that it was laying off 55 lawyers and 43 business professionals, equivalent to 5% of its global workforce.

Many major law firms went on a hiring spree globally in 2021 and early 2022, capitalizing on a record-breaking boom in corporate deal making.

However, they have leaned on job cuts to adjust to a decline in demand for legal services since last year as rising interest rates, high inflation and recession fears have soured some companies' appetites for deals and other legal work.

In Hong Kong, Dechert earlier this year axed the whole corporate offering team which had about four lawyers including one partner, as a market downturn and sluggish IPOs darken prospects, said one of the people and another person with direct knowledge.","(Reuters) -U.S.-founded law firm Dechert is considering closing its offices in Hong Kong and Beijing, becoming the latest foreign firm to scale back in Greater China, two people said, amid a prolonged capital market downturn and growing Sino-U.S. tensions.

PARIS (Reuters) -Marine Le Pen's far-right National Rally (RN) party scored historic gains to win the first round of France's parliamentary election on Sunday, exit polls showed, but the final result will depend on days of horsetrading before next week's run-off.

The RN was seen winning around 34% of the vote, exit polls from Ipsos, Ifop, OpinionWay and Elabe showed, in a huge setback for President Emmanuel Macron who had called the snap election after his ticket was trounced by the RN in European Parliament elections earlier this month.

The RN's share of the vote was comfortably ahead of leftist and centrist rivals, including Macron's Together alliance, whose bloc was seen winning 20.5%-23%. The New Popular Front (NFP), a hastily assembled left-wing coalition, was projected to win around 29% of the vote, the exit polls showed.

The exit polls were in line with opinion surveys ahead of the election, and were met with jubilation by Le Pen's supporters. However, they provided little clarity on whether the anti-immigrant, eurosceptic RN will be able to form a government to ""cohabit"" with the pro-EU Macron after next Sunday's run-off.

A longtime pariah for many in France, the RN is now closer to power than it has ever been. Le Pen has sought to clean up the image of a party known for racism and antisemitism, a tactic that has worked amid voter anger at Macron, the high cost of living and growing concerns over immigration.

At Le Pen's Henin-Beaumont constituency in northern France, supporters waved French flags and sung the Marseillaise.

""The French have shown their willingness to turn the page on a contemptuous and corrosive power,"" Le Pen told the cheering crowd.

The RN's chances of winning power next week will depend on the political dealmaking made by its rivals over the coming days. In the past, centre-right and centre-left parties have teamed up to keep the RN from power, but that dynamic, known as the ""republican front,"" is less certain than ever.

If no candidate reaches 50% in the first round, the top two contenders automatically qualify for the second round, as well as all those with 12.5% of registered voters. In the run-off, whoever wins the most votes take the constituency.

High turnout on Sunday suggests France is heading for a record number of three-way run-offs. These generally benefit the RN much more than two-way contests, experts say.

The horsetrading began almost immediately on Sunday night.

Macron called on voters to rally behind candidates who are ""clearly republican and democratic"", which, based on his recent declarations, would exclude candidates from the RN and from the hard-left France Unbowed (LFI) party.

Political leaders from the centre-left and far-left all called on their third-placed candidates to drop out.

""Our guideline is simple and clear: not a single more vote for the National Rally,"" France Unbowed leader Jean-Luc Melenchon said.

However, the centre-right Republicans party, which split ahead of the vote with a small number of its lawmakers joining the RN, gave no guidance.

POSSIBLE PRIME MINISTER

Jordan Bardella, the 28-year-old RN party president, said he was ready to be prime minister - if his party wins an absolute majority. He has ruled out trying to form a minority government and neither Macron nor the NFP leftist group will form an alliance with him.

""I will be a ""cohabitation"" Prime Minister, respectful of the constitution and of the office of President of the Republic, but uncompromising about the policies we will implement,"" he said.

The mood was gloomy at the Republique square in Paris, where a few thousand anti-RN protesters gathered at a rally of the leftist alliance on Sunday night.

Najiya Khaldi, a 33-year-old teacher, said she felt ""disgust, sadness and fear"" at the RN's strong results.

""I am not used to demonstrating,"" she said. ""I think I came to reassure myself, to not feel alone.""

Market reaction to Sunday's result was muted, with the euro gaining around 0.23% in early Asia-Pacific trading. Fiona Cincotta, senior markets analyst at London's City Index, described relief that the result yielded ""no surprises.""

""Le Pen had a slightly smaller margin than some of the polls had pointed to, which may have helped the euro a little bit higher on the open,"" she said. ""Attention now is on July 7 to see whether the second round supports an absolute majority or not. So it does feel like we're a little bit in limbo.""

COMPLEX CALCULUS

The RN was seen winning the most seats in the National Assembly, but only one of the pollsters - Elabe - had the party winning an absolute majority of 289 seats in the run-off.

Experts say seat projections after first-round votes can be highly inaccurate, and especially so in this election.

No nationwide official results were available on Sunday evening, but they were expected in the coming hours. Exit polls in France have tended to be highly accurate.

Voter participation was high compared with previous parliamentary elections, illustrating the political fervour Macron aroused with his stunning and politically risky decision to call a parliamentary vote.

At 1500 GMT, turnout was nearly 60%, compared with 39.42% two years ago - the highest comparable turnout figures since the 1986 legislative vote, Ipsos France's research director Mathieu Gallard said. It was unclear when the official turnout figure would be updated.","The New Popular Front (NFP), a hastily assembled left-wing coalition, was projected to win around 29% of the vote, the exit polls showed.

For FOXA, analysts note the company's strong network portfolio in news and sports, which is believed to remain resilient amid ongoing cord-cutting pressures in the media landscape.

Analysts project a 12% upside to 2025 Street EBITDA estimates, primarily driven by the Television segment. This growth is attributed to a robust lineup of sporting events, benefits from political advertising, and the company’s strategic optimization of sports rights.

“Analysts believe these drivers should more than offset core advertising declines. There is also an underappreciated value of FOXA’s unconsolidated assets,” Goldman said in the note.

Analysts covering GLBE see the company as a key player in the fast-growing segments of cross-border eCommerce and direct-to-consumer (DTC) eCommerce. They anticipate organic growth acceleration for GLBE in the second half of 2024 and into 2025, supported by a stabilizing consumer environment, improvements to its Shopify Markets Pro, and a strong pipeline of new partnerships.

(Reuters) -Boeing agreed to buy back Spirit AeroSystems (NYSE: ) for $4.7 billion in stock and Airbus moved to take on the supplier's loss-making Europe-focused activities in return for hundreds of millions of dollars of compensation following months of talks.

The near-two-decade independence of the world's largest standalone aerostructures company ended in a carve-up between its largest customers after the latest Boeing (NYSE: ) 737 MAX crisis, sparked by a mid-air door plug blowout in January, brought to a head doubts over the resilience of fuselage manufacturing.

Boeing, which spun off Spirit in 2005, said it would repurchase its former subsidiary for about $37.25 per share, as reported by Reuters on Sunday, giving it an enterprise value of $8.3 billion including debt.

""Bringing Spirit and Boeing together will enable greater integration of both companies' manufacturing and engineering capabilities, including safety and quality systems,"" Spirit CEO Pat Shanahan said in a statement.

Spirit shares rose some 8% in premarket trading, while Boeing dipped by just under 1%.

The Wichita, Kansas-based company said the deal offered a 30% premium versus the day before Boeing and Spirit announced talks to bring the struggling supplier back in house on March 1.

Boeing has long pondered buying back its former subsidiary, which analysts say has struggled to thrive independently despite diversifying into work for Europe's Airbus and others.

The decision to go ahead comes as Boeing tries to resolve a sprawling corporate and industrial crisis that has engulfed one of the industry's key suppliers.

Boeing is trying to move past months of difficulties sparked by the Jan. 5 blowout of a door plug on a virtually new Alaska Airlines 737 MAX 9 jet that exposed quality problems.

Those issues have led to a substantial slowdown in output at Boeing, rippling across the global commercial aviation industry.

The U.S. planemaker has also announced the planned departure of CEO Dave Calhoun in the wake of the crisis, with industry executives and analysts pointing to Spirit's Shanahan, a former senior Boeing executive, as one of the possible replacements.

It was not immediately clear how long he might be tied to Spirit, with the Boeing deal not due to close until mid-2025.

In a note to investors, Bernstein analyst Douglas Harned said the deal ""should add clarity ... potentially for the Boeing board’s attention to move to the decision on the next CEO"".

AIRBUS DEAL

Spirit, the manufacturer of the door plug, had been spun off from Boeing in one of a series of moves that critics say were emblematic of a focus on cost-cutting over quality.

Boeing made the decision to buy back Spirit in the aftermath of the door plug blowout, in what it described as an effort to address its safety problems and shore up its production line.

That raised questions over the future of work that Spirit caries out for Boeing's arch-rival Airbus, prompting the CEO of the European giant to warn in April that it stood ready if necessary to veto changes in control of Airbus-related plants.

On Monday, Airbus said it would take over core activities at four of the supplier's plants in the United States, Northern Ireland, France and Morocco as reported by Reuters last week.

It will also take over minor work currently carried out in Wichita. The separate Airbus deal was triggered by talks between Boeing and Spirit and was loosely coordinated between the three companies, sources said. It is subject to due diligence.

Airbus shares were up by about 2% in Monday morning trade.

Because Spirit's Airbus-related activities lose money, industry sources had said the European planemaker was pressing for up to $1 billion in compensation in return for taking over the plants, which make strategic parts for its A350 and A220 airliners.

Airbus said it would receive $559 million in compensation from Spirit, depending on the final outlines of the deal, while it would pay the supplier a symbolic $1 for the assets.

That echoes its decision to buy the Canadian-designed CSeries small jetliner program for just $1 from Bombardier (OTC: ) in 2018. It later renamed the jet the A220.

Until the latest shake-up, Airbus had not envisaged taking control of the loss-making A220 wings manufacturing carried out in Belfast, which Spirit bought from Bombardier in 2019.

Monday's deal lifts doubts over the future of part of Northern Ireland's top industrial employer, though sources have said Airbus may need to invest significant sums to increase output and make the wings more affordable to produce.

Spirit said it planned to sell operations in Prestwick, Scotland and in Subang, Malaysia that support Airbus programs and those in Belfast that do not support Airbus programs.","""Bringing Spirit and Boeing together will enable greater integration of both companies' manufacturing and engineering capabilities, including safety and quality systems,"" Spirit CEO Pat Shanahan said in a statement.

The filing with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission comes days after the investor, known for triggering the meme-stock rally of 2021, posted an uncaptioned picture of a puppy on social media platform X that briefly sent Chewy shares to a near one-year high on Thursday.

The filing, which lists Keith Gill as the reporting person, included a section ""Check the appropriate box to designate whether you are a cat"" under which the descriptor ""I am not a cat"" was checked.

The U.S. SEC, Chewy and Gill did not immediately respond to requests for comment.

Gill usually discloses his trading positions on platforms such as YouTube and Reddit, where he is known as ""DeepFuckingValue"", to the many retail traders who follow his cues.

The filing showed Gill owns 9 million shares of Chewy, equating to a stake worth about $245 million at the stock's Friday closing price of $27.24. The stake would make Gill Chewy's third-largest shareholder, according to LSEG data.

Chewy rival Petco Health and Wellness Company's shares fell 4%, reversing earlier gains.

Shares of Chewy, which sells pet food as well as medicine online, have risen 15% so far in 2024 but declined in the three preceding years as spending on pets slowed after a post-pandemic boom.

Its sales have been stable in the past few quarters despite weaker consumer spending on discretionary items. ""Pet humanization"" is a key part of Chewy's strategy, where owners splurge on pets as they are considered part of the family.

Some analysts said last week Gill's interest in Chewy could also be influenced by the fact that the pet retailer was founded by GameStop (NYSE: ) CEO Ryan Cohen.

GameStop had gained nearly 700% in the 2021 meme-stock rally, fueled by Gill's posts. Gill returned to Reddit on June 2 after a years-long hiatus, with a screenshot disclosing a sizeable GameStop stock and options position.

The U.S. SEC, Chewy and Gill did not immediately respond to requests for comment.
The filing showed Gill owns 9 million shares of Chewy, equating to a stake worth about $245 million at the stock's Friday closing price of $27.24.
The stake would make Gill Chewy's third-largest shareholder, according to LSEG data.

JERUSALEM (Reuters) - Bristol Myers (NYSE: ) Squibb has agreed to pay 10 million shekels ($2.7 million) in Israel to settle a potential case over its blocking of a generic version for anti-cancer drug Imnovid, Israel's Competition Authority said on Monday.

The anti-trust agency said that Bristol and Neopharm Scientific, the Israeli distributor of Imnovid - used for the treatment of multiple myeloma and AIDS-related Kaposi sarcoma - declined a request by KS Kim International for drug samples to make a copycat version of Imnovid.

After five months, the drugmakers provided the samples but the competition authority said it delayed competition for such an important drug.

Bristol, which has to make the payment within 60 days, and Neopharm were not immediately available to comment.

""We want to send a message to companies that have a dominant position in the market that they cannot act in a manner that is likely to reduce competition,"" Jonathan Cwikel, deputy legal counsel for civil and administrative affairs, told Reuters.

The authority intended to fine Neopharm 64 million shekels and an unnamed company executive 600,000 shekels, but even before it was able to issue a similar letter to Bristol, the firm offered the authority to settle, he said.

In signing the consent decree - which was seen by Reuters - and paying 10 million shekels, Bristol, Cwikel said, rejected any responsibility and did not admit any liability. ""On our part, we did not finalise our inquiry so we don't have any formal decision against them,"" he said.

So far, Neopharm has decided not to settle, Cwikel said, and will be presenting oral arguments at a hearing on Monday.

The fell 0.41% to close at 5,460.48, and the dropped 0.71% to 17,732.60. Both indexes hit new intraday highs earlier in the session before retreating. The dipped 45.20 points, or 0.12%, ending at 39,118.86.

All three major indexes advanced in June, marking their seventh positive month in eight. The Nasdaq led with a nearly 6% monthly gain, while the S&P 500 and Dow rose 3.5% and 1.1%, respectively. For the week, the Nasdaq added 0.2%, while the S&P 500 and Dow edged down by less than 0.1%.

May inflation slowed to its lowest annual rate in over three years, according to the Commerce Department. The core personal consumption expenditures (PCE) price index, excluding food and energy, rose 0.1% for the month and 2.6% year-over-year, matching Dow Jones estimates.

The core PCE is the Federal Reserve’s preferred inflation measure.

The headline PCE, including food and energy, remained flat month-over-month and increased 2.6% annually, also meeting expectations.

With the Q1 2024 earnings season wrapped up, the market’s attention this week will mainly center on upcoming economic data releases, most notably the ISM manufacturing index on Monday, the JOLTS job openings report on Tuesday, and the nonfarm payrolls (NFP) report on Friday. Moreover, the minutes from the June FOMC meeting will be published on Wednesday.

For Friday’s employment report, Goldman Sachs economists expect that non-farm payrolls rose by 140,000 in June.

“Big Data measures continue to indicate a below-normal pace of job creation during the spring hiring season, and our layoff tracker is also edging higher from low levels,” they said in a note.

“We also assume a 50k drag from payback effects, because the longer-than-usual May payroll month likely pulled forward reported job growth into last month’s report.”

Economists also project that the unemployment rate remained unchanged at 4%, reflecting rising household employment offsetting a 0.1 percentage point rebound in labor force participation to 62.6%.

In addition, there are several speaking engagements from Federal Reserve officials scheduled for this week, including Fed Chair Powell on Tuesday and New York Fed President Williams on Wednesday and Friday.

BofA: S&P 500 poised for a strong second half after positive 1H

Bank of America strategists forecast a strong second half for the S&P 500 (SPX) following a positive first half of 2024.

The benchmark equity index rose 14.48% in the first half, marking the 16th-best first-half performance since 1928. Historically, when the index rallies in the first six months, it tends to perform well in the latter half, being up 74% of the time with average and median returns of 5.70% and 6.56%, respectively.

The first half of 2024 marks the 26th time the SPX has gained between 10% and 20% in the initial six months. This pattern suggests a positive outlook, with the index historically rising 88% of the time in the second half, averaging a return of 8.58% and a median return of 10.13%.

In Presidential election years, a strong first half further boosts the SPX's prospects for the latter half, with an 88% chance of gains, BofA highlighted. However, the expected average and median returns are slightly lower at 6.98% and 5.47%, respectively.

Overall, during the last six months of all Presidential election years since 1928, the SPX has risen 83% of the time, with average returns of 7.26% and median returns of 6.12%.

""When the SPX rallies over the first six months of the year, the index is stronger over the rest of the year and is up 74% of the time on average,"" BofA strategists said in a note.

What analysts are saying about US stocks

BTIG: “As we enter the second half of the year, we are left with more questions than answers. Namely the breadth expansion that was occurring in late '23 fizzled out and was never able to find its footing despite cooling inflation and lower long-term rates. The equal-weight S&P 500 (SPW) has underperformed the SPX by nearly 10% over the first six months, one of the worst such stretches on record back to 1990 and by far the worst 'first six months' of the year. If small-caps are going to work, we think they have to start soon or they become the 'canary in the coalmine' rather than a rotation opportunity. At this point small-cap growth (IWO) looks better than value, but it's still in a 'show me' state.”

Wedbush: “We believe NASDAQ has another strong 2H ahead as tech stocks will be up 15% the rest of 2024 in our view with tech fundamentals set to accelerate as AI use cases materially expand. On the enterprise AI front Nvidia/Microsoft will drive this while Apple/Meta/Google now unleash the consumer AI Revolution heading into year-end with iPhone 16 the beginning of this AI driven smartphone era. The Godfather of AI Jensen and Nvidia (NASDAQ: ) have been the stars of the AI Party on the disco dance floor along with Nadella and Microsoft (NASDAQ: ) as the enterprise AI tidal wave of spending has just begun with the Street now laser focused on who the winners are in this next wave of AI driven spend. Looking into 2H24 we believe a massive broader tech rally is ahead as the AI Revolution now accelerates.

Goldman Sachs: “The first presidential debate shifted prediction market probabilities in favor of an Trump victory. The debate window generally saw modest upward moves in US equities and bond yields and mixed performance across FX. Shifts in asset prices were small relative to the shifts in election outcome probabilities.

“Equity and bond shifts were comparable to our fundamental estimates, but we ultimately expect clearer and broader USD strength from a shift towards a Republican presidency than what we saw in FX markets.”

Deutsche Bank: “As we noted last week, we see conditions in place for an equity market breather in the near term with diminished support from all three elements of our demand-supply framework: there is little room for positioning to rise after a sharp but narrow jump to elevated levels; inflows are likely to ease as risk appetite declines from stretched levels; and buybacks diminish temporarily as blackout periods ramp up. This suggests a sideways market in the near term, but one that is vulnerable to negative shocks with plenty of potential catalysts geopolitically as well as in domestic politics.”","U.S. stocks edged lower on Friday as traders reacted to new economic data signaling slowing inflation and better-than-expected consumer sentiment.

The investment firm highlights the underperformance of small-cap stocks and lingering questions about interest rates.

The ""breadth expansion"" of late 2023, characterized by strong performance across sectors, failed to materialize despite easing inflation and lower interest rates, they note.

BTIG points to the equal-weight S&P 500 (SPW), which tracks all S&P 500 companies with equal weight, significantly underperforming the broader S&P 500 (SPX) in the first half of 2024. This is said to represent one of the worst such performances on record.

The lackluster performance of small-cap stocks is a particular concern for BTIG. The analysts note that if this trend continues, small-caps could signal a broader market downturn rather than a rotation opportunity.

While small-cap growth stocks (IWO) are currently showing more promise than small-cap value stocks, BTIG believes the overall performance needs to improve for a clear signal.

Interest rates pose another lingering question. Bond yields remain stuck in a range, impacted by conflicting forces. Softening economic data puts downward pressure on yields, while fiscal concerns and persistent inflation keep them from falling further.

(Reuters) -Amazon has become the first company to sidestep a global standard for verifying carbon offsets that was developed by a non-profit funded largely by the U.S. technology conglomerate's founder and executive chair, Jeff Bezos.

Amazon (NASDAQ: ) is backing the development of a new standard that could allow the online retailer and cloud-computing provider to overcome a dearth of supply for quality-labeled offsets, enabling it to meet its target of cutting its greenhouse-gas emissions to zero on a net basis by 2040. Critics worry that the move could lead to market confusion and a compromise in the standards of carbon offsets.

Companies under pressure to curb their emissions can buy credits from developers of projects that absorb carbon, such as through reforestation. The market for offsets has remained small due to a limited number of projects that can verify their climate benefits.

Amazon told Reuters it has completed work on Abacus, a framework for verifying the quality of carbon offsets in reforestation and agroforestry. Amazon developed the standard with carbon registry Verra as an alternative to one developed by the Integrity Council for the Voluntary Carbon Market (ICVCM), the world's biggest grouping of private sector and environmental groups dedicated to validating carbon offsets. Verra first announced it was developing the label with Amazon and its Abacus working group in 2022.

Bezos, through his $10-billion Earth Fund that he set up to tackle climate change, is one of ICVCM's biggest donors, having plowed at least $11 million into ICVCM and sister organization Voluntary Carbon Markets Integrity Initiative since their 2021 launch.

Jamey Mulligan, Amazon's head of carbon neutralization, said in an interview that the company evaluated and supported ICVCM's work, but that it wanted a more ambitious standard.

""We want to ensure that every credit investment has a real, conservatively quantified and verified impact on emissions,"" Mulligan said. He declined to comment on whether Bezos was involved in Amazon's decision.

Bezos could not be reached for comment.

Alphabet (NASDAQ: ), Meta (NASDAQ: ), Microsoft (NASDAQ: ) and Salesforce (NYSE: ) have said they plan to buy up to 20 million metric tons of Abacus-certified credits.

Pedro Martins Barata, co-chair of ICVCM's panel of experts, said he was worried about development of an alternative standard and that he hoped that Abacus would eventually be folded into ICVCM.

""Otherwise, you get again into a confusing state in the market where each set of companies will find their own standards they want to support and they will say that they're a particular type of quality,"" he said.

Kelley Kizzier, director of corporate action and markets at Bezos Earth Fund and a member of ICVCM's board, said Abacus is complementary rather than competitive to ICVCM. She also declined to comment on Bezos' role.

""What we need to focus on is generating high-integrity (offsets). There is room for lots of actors to do that,"" Kizzier said.

The label will be available within weeks, Verra said.

OFFSET MARKET

The $2-billion market for voluntary carbon offsets has remained small amid concerns by companies and investors that the underlying projects may not curb as many emissions as they claim.

The market accounts for offsetting 300 million metric tons of emissions annually, according to an Environmental Defense Fund analysis of data from financial information provider MSCI. Yet only a fraction of those offsets are verified, with ICVCM's main quality label, CCP, accounting for 27 million tons.

""My main concern with the strategy remains with the idea that the purchase of these credits somehow 'neutralizes' Amazon's impact. I don't think it does,"" said Gilles Dufrasne, policy lead at environmental non-profit Carbon Market Watch.

Deborah Lawrence, chief scientist at credit ratings firm Calyx Global, welcomed the label's requirement to make public data on how much carbon the projects store but said it still had questions about Abacus’ ability to ensure the carbon removals are permanent.

""Their permanence position requires further investigation,"" she said. ""The way it is phrased is giving us pause, but their annual monitoring and making the results public are great ideas and raise the bar.""

Amazon generated 71.3 million tons of carbon dioxide equivalent emissions in 2022, according to its latest sustainability report, of which 54.98 million tons came from its supply chain.

It will take two to three years for projects to qualify for the Abacus label because many rely on trees growing and then developers proving how much carbon they absorb.

Mulligan said Amazon could become one of the biggest carbon-credit buyers, but that it would not use them in place of the company's efforts to decarbonise its business.

He added that Amazon is currently reviewing more than 70 proposals from developers and expects to restore tens of thousands of hectares of degraded land.

Any developer can apply for the Abacus label provided they meet requirements of Verra's methodology, which the Abacus working group, a team of scientists, non-governmental organizations and industry specialists helped develop.

Eron Bloomgarden, founder of Emergent, a not-for-profit organization that mobilises private-sector funding for forest countries, said Abacus would help grow the carbon-offset market.

""The work of ICVCM is important but it's insufficient for the growth of the market, because what we are trying to do is solve big existential challenges like climate change and biodiversity extinction,"" he said.","Critics worry that the move could lead to market confusion and a compromise in the standards of carbon offsets.

Shares in GameStop (NYSE: ) fell in premarket trading Monday after ""Roaring Kitty,"" the stock influencer behind GME's meme stock surges, disclosed a stake in online pet food retailer Chewy (NYSE: ).

GameStop stock was down more than 6% at the time of writing.

According to a filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), Roaring Kitty, whose real name is Keith Gill, has acquired a 6.6% stake in CHWY, or more than 9 million shares, sending the company’s shares surging more than 19% Monday.

The filing follows a cryptic social media post by Gill featuring a picture of a dog, which had already driven Chewy's shares to nearly a one-year high last Thursday.

The move makes Gill Chewy’s third-largest shareholder, according to FactSet, with a stake valued at over $245 million based on Friday’s closing price.

Gill, a well-known advocate of GameStop, has been actively influencing trading in the video game retailer in recent months. In mid-June, he disclosed holding 9.001 million GameStop shares after closing out his large call options position. It remains unclear if he sold his GameStop holdings to finance his investment in Chewy.

In a related development, reports on Monday revealed that Gill is facing securities fraud allegations in a class-action lawsuit related to recent social media posts that caused volatile price swings in GME stock between May and June.

The complaint, filed on June 28 in the United States District Court for the Eastern District of New York, accuses Gill of orchestrating a “pump and dump” scheme through a series of social media posts starting on May 13.

The lawsuit claims that Gill engaged in securities fraud by failing to adequately disclose his purchases and sales of GameStop options, allegedly misleading his followers and resulting in financial losses for some investors.

Plaintiff Martin Radev, represented by the law firm Pomerantz, claims he suffered losses from the alleged “pump and dump” scheme after purchasing 25 shares of GameStop and three call options beginning in mid-May.","(Updated - July 1, 2024 7:55 AM EDT)Shares in GameStop (NYSE: ) fell in premarket trading Monday after ""Roaring Kitty,"" the stock influencer behind GME's meme stock surges, disclosed a stake in online pet food retailer Chewy (NYSE: ).
GameStop stock was down more than 6% at the time of writing.
The filing follows a cryptic social media post by Gill featuring a picture of a dog, which had already driven Chewy's shares to nearly a one-year high last Thursday.
Gill, a well-known advocate of GameStop, has been actively influencing trading in the video game retailer in recent months.
In mid-June, he disclosed holding 9.001 million GameStop shares after closing out his large call options position.","['gamestop', 'stake', 'kitty', 'retailer', 'discloses', 'social', 'options', 'gill', 'stock', 'media', 'slide', 'million', 'pet', 'securities', 'roaring', 'shares', 'investingcom']",https://i-invdn-com.investing.com/news/GameStop_800x533_L_1612384546.jpg,False,updat juli edt share gamestop nyse fell premarket trade monday roar kitti stock influenc behind gmes meme stock surg disclos stake onlin pet food retail chewi nyse gamestop stock time write accord file secur exchang commiss sec roar kitti whose real name keith gill acquir stake chwi million share send compani 's share surg monday file follow cryptic social media post gill featur pictur dog alreadi driven chewi share near oneyear high last thursday move make gill chewi 's thirdlargest sharehold accord factset stake valu million base friday 's close price gill wellknown advoc gamestop activ influenc trade video game retail recent month midjun disclos hold million gamestop share close larg call option posit remain unclear sold gamestop hold financ invest chewi relat develop report monday reveal gill face secur fraud alleg classact lawsuit relat recent social media post caus volatil price swing gme stock may june complaint file june unit state district court eastern district new york accus gill orchestr `` pump dump '' scheme seri social media post start may lawsuit claim gill engag secur fraud fail adequ disclos purchas sale gamestop option alleg mislead follow result financi loss investor plaintiff martin radev repres law firm pomerantz claim suffer loss alleg `` pump dump '' scheme purchas share gamestop three call option begin midmay

BERLIN (Reuters) -German inflation fell more than expected in June, resuming its downward trend after two consecutive months of increases.

Inflation eased to 2.5% in June, preliminary data from the federal statistics office showed on Monday.

Analysts polled by Reuters had forecast a reading of 2.6%, after a year-on-year increase in consumer prices of 2.8% in May, based on data harmonised to compare with other European Union countries.

In March, inflation in Europe's largest economy slackened to 2.3%, its lowest level since June 2021.

Core inflation, which excludes volatile food and energy prices, fell to 2.9% from 3.0% in May.

Economists pay close attention to German inflation data, as the euro zone's biggest economy publishes its figures before the euro zone inflation data release, expected on Tuesday.

Euro zone inflation is expected at 2.5% in June, down from 2.6% in the previous month, according to economists polled by Reuters.

In Germany, fewer companies intend to raise their prices than in the previous month, according to a survey by the Ifo institute published on Monday.

“The inflation rate is therefore likely to continue its slow decline and fall below the 2% mark in August for the first time since March 2021,” said Timo Wollmershaeuser, head of forecasts at Ifo.","By Maria MartinezBERLIN (Reuters) -German inflation fell more than expected in June, resuming its downward trend after two consecutive months of increases.

LONDON/TOKYO (Reuters) -Manufacturing activity in Europe suffered a setback last month but Asian factories enjoyed solid momentum, offering policymakers some hope the region can weather the hit from soft Chinese demand, surveys showed.

The downturn in Europe was widespread, with Italy the only big player not to see a fall in its Purchasing Managers' Index (PMI) despite manufacturers largely cutting prices.

HCOB's final euro zone manufacturing PMI, compiled by S&P Global, fell to 45.8 in June from May's 47.3. It has been below the 50 mark separating growth from contraction for two years.

""What looks like the green shoots of recovery seem to be diminishing. We can't take a recovery for granted,"" said George Moran at Nomura.

Germany's factory sector, which accounts for about a fifth of Europe's biggest economy, experienced a retreat, while in France the manufacturing recession deepened.

France's far-right National Rally party scored an historic win in parliamentary elections on Sunday, stoking risks of a crisis in the euro area even as other political parties rushed to build a united front to block its path to power.

In Britain, which holds a national election on Thursday, manufacturing growth slipped in June from May's 22-month high as ongoing disruption to shipping in the Red Sea led to lower demand from overseas customers.

A euro zone index measuring output, which feeds into a composite PMI due on Wednesday that is seen as a good gauge of economic health, sank from May's 49.3 to a six-month low of 46.1, albeit just ahead of the 46.0 flash estimate.

A new orders index in the currency union dropped to 44.4 from 47.3, despite factories cutting prices charged for a fourteenth month.

WEAK YEN BOOSTS IMPORT COSTS

But cost pressures weighed on manufacturers in countries like Japan, where a weak yen is boosting the price companies pay for fuel and raw material imports.

China's Caixin/S&P Global manufacturing PMI rose to 51.8 in June from 51.7. It marked the fastest clip in more than three years and exceeded market forecasts of 51.2.

The private-sector reading followed official PMI data on Sunday showing China's manufacturing activity fell for a second month in June and services activity slid to a five-month low.

The surveys demonstrate how Chinese firms are ramping up production despite weak domestic demand, which Beijing has failed to reverse with a rescue package for an ailing property sector.

In a sign Asia is benefiting from solid global demand, South Korea's factory activity growth quickened in June to the fastest in 26 months on surging new orders, its PMI showed.

Factory activity also expanded in June at a faster pace than in May in Vietnam and Taiwan, other surveys showed.

""Another strong month of data provides further evidence that global industrial activity and trade are picking up,"" said Joe Hayes, principal economist at S&P Global Market Intelligence, on South Korea's factory activity.

""Viewed as a bellwether for exports due to its integration in supply chains for key intermediate goods like batteries and semiconductors, South Korean manufacturing output and orders often provide leading signals for trends more broadly.""

Japan's factory activity expanded in June, but at a slower pace than in May, as companies struggled with rising costs due to the weak yen.

The final au Jibun Bank Japan manufacturing PMI was 50.0, on the break-even line, after a brief improvement to 50.4 in May.

A PMI gauging Japanese firms' future output expectations rose to a six-month high thanks to a better medium-term outlook for the car and chip sectors.

S&P Global's UK Manufacturing Purchasing Managers' Index dropped to 50.9 in June from 51.2 in May. The final reading was lower than 51.4 in the provisional June data.

S&P said the broad picture was positive, with output and new orders both rising, but employment fell, delivery times lengthened and manufacturers' input costs rose at the fastest pace since January 2023.

""Shipping issues resulting from the Red Sea crisis, low stocks at suppliers, insufficient vendor capacity and port issues all led to longer lead times,"" S&P said.

While output and overall new orders grew at close to their fastest pace in two years, export orders fell for a 29th successive month, due to the shipping delays and high freight costs.

International shipping has been disrupted since November by attacks launched by Yemen's Houthi militants, an Iran-aligned group who say the attacks are in solidarity with Palestinians in the war between Israel and militant Islamist group Hamas.

Many vessels have opted to avoid the Red Sea route to the Suez Canal, taking the longer journey around the southern tip of Africa instead.

BERLIN (Reuters) - The downturn in Germany's manufacturing sector, which accounts for about a fifth of Europe's biggest economy, experienced a fresh setback in June as output and new orders declined at a faster pace, a survey showed on Monday.

The HCOB final Purchasing Managers' Index (PMI) for German manufacturing fell to 43.5 in June from 45.4 in May, confirming a preliminary flash estimate and remaining below the 50 level that separates growth from contraction.

""The accelerated fall in new orders and especially export orders indicates that we will have to wait some more months until a recovery in the manufacturing sector can be seen,"" said Cyrus de la Rubia, chief economist at Hamburg Commercial Bank.

One likely explanation for the weak exports orders is increasing competition from China, which is ramping up its exports worldwide due to sluggish domestic demand, he added.

""This situation creates a double whammy for German exporters,"" de la Rubia said, noting firms were facing fewer exports to China at the same time as heightened competition from Chinese products, especially in emerging markets.

The destocking cycle showed no signs of turning as firms reported deepening declines in both pre- and post-production inventories.

However, companies were more optimistic about the future than they were in May, with sentiment hitting the highest since February 2022.

Anecdotal evidence highlighted hopes of a pick-up in exports, increased investment and a general improvement in economic conditions over the next 12 months.

On the price front, demand weakness continued to put downward pressure on both input costs and factory gate charges.

TOKYO (Reuters) -Japan downgraded first-quarter gross domestic product (GDP) on Monday and the service-sector business mood soured in June on concerns over rising costs, offseting a lift in factory confidence and pointing to weakness in consumption.

But the ""tankan"" quarterly survey showed firms planned to ramp up capital expenditure and projected inflation to stay around the Bank of Japan's target of 2% in coming years, keeping alive market expectations of a near-term interest rate hike.

The findings, which come ahead of the BOJ's next policy meeting on July 30 and 31, complicate its decision on how soon to raise interest rates, analysts say.

""The improvement in business sentiment may have peaked, particularly for non-manufacturers. This data doesn't necessarily help the BOJ make the case for an early rate hike,"" said Toru Suehiro, chief economist at Daiwa Securities.

""But corporate inflation expectations heightened slightly, which will likely keep alive market expectations for a near-term rate hike.""

A rare unscheduled downgrade to Japan's historical gross domestic product (GDP) data showed the economy shrank more than reported in the first quarter, which will probably force the BOJ to cut its growth forecasts this month.

Separately, the BOJ's tankan showed service-sector firms were less optimistic in June than three months ago, suggesting a tight job market and soft consumption were hurting sentiment.

An index of big non-manufacturers' sentiment fell to +33 in June from +34 in March, matching market forecasts and worsening for the first time in two years.

By contrast, the headline index measuring big manufacturers' mood rose to +13 in June from +11 in March, exceeding a median market forecast for a reading of +12.

The reading, the highest since March 2022, reflected a rebound in auto output and manufacturers' success in passing on rising costs of raw material through price hikes.

Big firms plan to increase capital expenditure by 11.1% in the current fiscal year ending in March 2025, after a gain of 10.6% in the previous year, the tankan showed.

In a sign of rising inflationary pressure, an index of output prices rose for both manufacturers and non-manufacturers, the survey showed.

Long-term corporate inflation expectations also heightened slightly, with companies projecting inflation to hit 2.3% three years from now and 2.2% five years ahead, the tankan showed.

""Corporate inflation expectations seem anchored at 2%,"" said Ko Nakayama, chief economist at Okasan Securities. ""The tankan is a tailwind for the BOJ in normalising monetary policy.""

The Monday up 0.12%, having pared gains after the tankan on expectations that rising inflation prospects will prompt the BOJ to raise rates soon.

GDP MAY AFFECT BOJ RATE HIKE TIMING

The BOJ ended negative interest rates in March on the view that sustained achievement of its 2% inflation target has come into sight. Governor Kazuo Ueda has signaled the chance of more hikes if underlying inflation heads toward 2%, as it projects.

Many market players expect the BOJ to raise rates again this year with some betting on the chance of action in July. Others, however, see hurdles for the BOJ to act so soon.

A revision to historical data showed Japan's GDP shrank an annualised 2.9% in January-March, down from an earlier estimate of a 1.8% contraction, reflecting corrections in past data on construction orders.

The GDP for last year's third and fourth quarters was also revised down.

The revisions, which came on top of recent weak consumption and output data, are likely to affect the BOJ's quarterly growth and price forecasts due at its July 30-31 policy meeting.

Yoshiki Shinke, an economist at Dai-ichi Life Research Institute, expects the GDP revisions to lead to a significant downgrade in this fiscal year's growth forecast.

""I wonder if the BOJ can manage to trim bond buying and hike rates simultaneously in July, when there's a growth downgrade showing the economy was in worse shape than thought,"" he said.","""But corporate inflation expectations heightened slightly, which will likely keep alive market expectations for a near-term rate hike.""

BENGALURU (Reuters) - Activity in India's manufacturing sector rebounded last month as output increased on robust demand, leading to the fastest rate of hiring in over 19 years, despite inflationary pressures remaining elevated, a survey showed.

Strong demand is a much needed ingredient for growth in Asia's third-largest economy, which is the fastest growing among major economies, but much of the expansion is attributed to the government's infrastructure spending.

The HSBC final India Manufacturing Purchasing Managers' Index, compiled by S&P Global, rose to 58.3 in June, marginally below a preliminary 58.5 estimate, from a three-month low of 57.5 in May.

""The Indian manufacturing sector ended the June quarter on stronger footing,"" said Maitreyi Das, global economist at HSBC.

""While the overall outlook for the manufacturing sector remains positive, the future output index receded to a three-month low, albeit it remains above the historical average.""

Upbeat demand lifted the output and new order sub-indexes in June, stretching the current sequence of expansion to three years. Growth in international demand eased in June, but stayed above the long run average.

Bigger workloads generated more jobs. Hiring increased for a fourth consecutive month and at the sharpest rate since the survey began over 19 years ago.

This was despite business sentiment falling to a three-month low, however, it remained strong and above the long-run average.

An improvement in hiring would bring some respite to the ruling Bhartiya Janta Party, which has lost its parliamentary majority, and had to form its third-term government with the support of regional parties.

Creating jobs would be the biggest challenge for the government over the next five years, a Reuters poll of policy experts found.

Inflationary pressures remained elevated, the PMI survey showed. While cost prices increased at a marginally slower pace from May, prices charged to customers rose at the fastest pace in two years.

""Manufacturers were able to pass on higher costs to customers, as demand remained robust, resulting in improved margin,"" added Das.

However, inflation will average near the mid-point of the Reserve Bank of India's (RBI) target range of 2-6%, at 4.6% and 4.5% in the current and next fiscal years, the latest Reuters survey showed.

The RBI was expected to lower its interest rate next quarter by 25 basis points to 6.25%, followed by another cut of the same size in the January-March quarter, the Reuters survey showed.","The HSBC final India Manufacturing Purchasing Managers' Index, compiled by S&P Global, rose to 58.3 in June, marginally below a preliminary 58.5 estimate, from a three-month low of 57.5 in May.

55 minutes ago By Simon Jack and Faarea Masud , BBC Business Share

The Unite union has called off a strike planned for 8 July so further talks can take place over the future of the UK’s largest steel works at Port Talbot in Wales. Owners Tata had threatened to bring forward the planned closure of both remaining blast furnaces the day before the strike, citing safety fears due to a staff walkout. Unite’s strike action was called to the dismay of other unions who feared that it would accelerate the closure of blast furnace number four, which was not due to be shut down until September. The Community and GMB unions had hoped that would give them time for more negotiations to extend the life of the remaining furnace with a potentially new government in place.

Unite general secretary Sharon Graham said the talks were ""essential"". ""Workers were simply not prepared to stand idly by while steel making ended and their communities were laid to waste,"" she said, saying the focus should be on fresh investment and the continuation of long-term steel making in the region.

On Thursday Tata said it would close both furnaces within days unless it could ""safely and stably operate"" them during the strike. Then it wrote to all three unions, offering to begin new talks if the strike was called off. The firm says the talks will not renegotiate the existing plan but will focus on future investment opportunities.

'Serious mistake'

Several months of talks with unions commenced after Tata said it planned to radically transform its south Wales operations to deal with financial losses and to reduce its carbon emissions. The government has already promised the firm a £500m grant towards the development of a new £1.25bn electric arc furnace which recycles scrap metal, is less energy intensive, but requires far fewer staff. Tata said the move would secure the future of steel making at the site. The Community steel union has called Tata's decision ""a serious mistake”. After the company rejected union plans to keep one blast furnace running at the site in April, Community's Roy Rickhaus said at the time: ""We do not accept the company's assertion our plan was too expensive - in fact, it would have returned the company to profits.""

The closure of both furnaces at Port Talbot would cost 2,800 jobs. But extending the life of one of them would save 2,000 of those jobs if the remaining blast furnace was left on until the new electric arc furnace has been built on the site, which could take up to three years. Sources close to the matter told the BBC that Unite had given Tata the perfect excuse to shut down early, accelerating job losses. But Unite officials rejected that, saying their action “helped focus minds”, and are claiming a victory of sorts over the news that further talks will take place after the election. However, in a letter to unions from Tata - seen by the BBC - it is clear the company had already agreed to further talks after the upcoming election.

High mortgage rates mean affordability is still ""stretched"" for many home buyers, according to the Nationwide. The building society said that while earnings had been rising faster than house prices in recent years, this had not been enough to offset the impact of more expensive mortgages. Its comments came as it said house price growth had been ""broadly stable"" in June, with prices up 0.2% from the previous month. The average house price is now £266,064, the lender said.

Prices were up 1.5% from a year earlier, but Nationwide said activity in the housing market had been ""broadly flat"" over the past 12 months, with transactions down by about 15% compared with 2019. The lender said the market was still being affected by the increase in mortgage rates, which started climbing after the Bank of England began to raise its key interest rate in late 2021. Robert Gardner, Nationwide's chief economist, said that mortgage rates are ""still well above the record lows prevailing in 2021 in the wake of the pandemic"". ""For example, the interest rate on a five-year fixed rate mortgage for a borrower with a 25% deposit was 1.3% in late 2021, but in recent months this has been nearer to 4.7%. ""As a result, housing affordability is still stretched."" Nationwide's figures are based on the building society's own mortgage lending, which does not include buyers who purchase homes with cash, or buy-to-let deals. Cash buyers account for about a third of housing sales. The impact of higher borrowing costs can be seen in the fact that transactions involving a mortgage are down by nearly 25% over the past year, Nationwide said. Meanwhile the number of cash transactions for properties is about 5% higher than pre-pandemic levels. Across the UK, Northern Ireland saw the biggest price increases, up 4.1% from a year earlier. Wales and Scotland both saw a 1.4% annual rise. Prices in England climbed by 0.6%, with northern regions seeing bigger increases in general than the south.

Despite some major lenders cutting their mortgage rates last week, home loan costs remain far higher than pre-pandemic levels. According to financial information service Moneyfacts, the average rate on a two-year fixed mortgage deal stands at 5.95%, while for a five-year deal the average is 5.53%. The focus is now on the Bank of England's Monetary Policy Committee (MPC), which sets interest rates, to see if it decides to cut at its next meeting on 1 August. June's MPC meeting saw a change in tone from policymakers, with suggestions that the Bank could vote for a rate cut next month. ""Buyers may find their mojo again when we get a rate cut from the Bank of England,"" said Sarah Coles, head of personal finance at Hargreaves Lansdown. ""This could come as early as August, although sticky services inflation and higher wages could mean we need to wait until the autumn. ""Either way, we’re not expecting massive overnight drops in mortgage rates, so the reaction is more likely to be a muted upturn in sentiment than an overwhelming wave of optimism.""

Last week, the Bank said that about three million households are set to see their mortgage payments rise in the next two years. These are homeowners who arranged mortgage deals before the Bank started to lift rates in 2021. These deals are now expiring, and the Bank said the majority will finish before the end of 2026. For the typical household looking for a new deal, monthly mortgage repayments are forecast to increase by about £180, or about 28%, the Bank said. However, for around 400,000 households, monthly payments could jump by 50% or more. Bank of England figures released on Monday showed a small fall in the number of mortgages approved in May, down to 60,000 from 60,800 in April. However, the data also showed the amount borrowed through mortgages dropped sharply to £1.2bn in May, from £2.2bn the month before, although this does not include those remortgaging with the same lender.

A drop in domestic gas and electricity prices has now taken effect, but costs are expected to rise again in October. Regulator Ofgem's new price cap for England, Wales and Scotland came into force on Monday, meaning a typical household's energy bill will fall by £122 a year. That brings down the bill for a household using a typical amount of gas and electricity to £1,568 a year, the lowest for two years. But forecasters expect it to rise again in the run-up to winter, more than reversing the latest drop.

Leading consultancy Cornwall Insight predicts that a typical household's annual bill will be back up to £1,723 in October, a £155, or 10%, increase from now. ""Modest falls in summer look set to be wiped out by bigger rises in autumn when people will need to put the heating back on,"" said Adam Scorer, chief executive of charity National Energy Action. ""The cost of energy remains an unaffordable luxury that many of the poorest simply cannot afford."" Although the price cap is changed every three months, it is illustrated by Ofgem in terms of an annual bill for a household using a typical amount of gas and electricity. People in larger properties will tend to pay more overall owing to higher energy usage, and those in smaller properties will pay less.

That is because the cap, set by Ofgem, limits the maximum price that can be charged for each unit of gas and electricity - not the total bill. It affects the gas and electricity bills of 28 million households, but does not impact customers in Northern Ireland, where the sector is regulated differently but where prices are also falling.

Energy bills are considerably lower than the peak after Russia's invasion of Ukraine, when the government stepped in to limit bill rises. That has fed through to falls in the general rate of rising prices, known as inflation. However, a typical household's energy bill remains about £400 higher than three years ago, prompting debate over the issue during the election campaign.

In addition, households have built up a collective debt to suppliers of about £3bn owing, primarily, to the pressure from high prices. Those on prepayment meters, who tend to top up meters during the colder, darker months and are often under more financial pressure, will see a less immediate impact of a drop in prices in the summer. The vast majority of households pay by direct debit, and their payments are smoothed out over the year. They should have been contacted by their supplier about the latest price changes. Experts say it is a good idea to take a meter reading now, to ensure billpayers are charged at the correct rate. Ofgem is reviewing the way the price cap is calculated, including sifting through a host of responses to a consultation on standing charges.

Latest changes in detail

The new prices that took effect for July to the end of September mean: Gas prices are now capped at 5.48p per kilowatt hour (kWh), and electricity at 22.36p per kWh

A typical household uses 2,700 kWh of electricity a year, and 11,500 kWh of gas

Households on pre-payment meters pay slightly less than those on direct debit, with a typical bill of £1,522

Those who pay their bills every three months by cash or cheque pay more, with a typical bill of £1,668

Standing charges - a fixed daily charge covering the costs of connecting to a supply - are unchanged at 60p a day for electricity and 31p a day for gas, although they vary by region

How to keep energy use - and bills - down","Regulator Ofgem's new price cap for England, Wales and Scotland came into force on Monday, meaning a typical household's energy bill will fall by £122 a year.
Leading consultancy Cornwall Insight predicts that a typical household's annual bill will be back up to £1,723 in October, a £155, or 10%, increase from now.
However, a typical household's energy bill remains about £400 higher than three years ago, prompting debate over the issue during the election campaign.
The vast majority of households pay by direct debit, and their payments are smoothed out over the year.
Ofgem is reviewing the way the price cap is calculated, including sifting through a host of responses to a consultation on standing charges.","['electricity', 'typical', 'bills', 'bill', 'mean', 'gas', 'relief', 'households', 'lower', 'energy', 'cap', 'change', 'pay', 'prices', 'temporary', 'price']",https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/1b8b/live/86520530-3305-11ef-9f4c-8785b0c18838.jpg,False,energi price fall relief may temporari hour ago kevin peachey cost live correspond share getti imag drop domest gas electr price taken effect cost expect rise octob regul ofgem new price cap england wale scotland came forc monday mean typic household energi bill fall ps year bring bill household use typic amount gas electr ps year lowest two year forecast expect rise runup winter revers latest drop lead consult cornwal insight predict typic household annual bill back ps octob ps increas now modest fall summer look set wipe bigger rise autumn peopl need put heat back on said adam scorer chief execut chariti nation energi action the cost energi remain unafford luxuri mani poorest simpli can not afford although price cap chang everi three month illustr ofgem term annual bill household use typic amount gas electr peopl larger properti tend pay overal owe higher energi usag smaller properti pay less cap set ofgem limit maximum price charg unit gas electr total bill affect gas electr bill million household impact custom northern ireland sector regul differ price also fall energi bill consider lower peak russia invas ukrain govern step limit bill rise fed fall general rate rise price known inflat howev typic household energi bill remain ps higher three year ago prompt debat issu elect campaign addit household built collect debt supplier psbn owe primarili pressur high price prepay meter tend top meter colder darker month often financi pressur see less immedi impact drop price summer vast major household pay direct debit payment smooth year contact supplier latest price chang expert say good idea take meter read now ensur billpay charg correct rate ofgem review way price cap calcul includ sift host respons consult stand charg latest chang detail new price took effect juli end septemb mean gas price cap p per kilowatt hour kwh electr p per kwh typic household use kwh electr year kwh gas household prepay meter pay slight less direct debit typic bill ps pay bill everi three month cash chequ pay more typic bill ps stand charg fix daili charg cover cost connect suppli unchang p day electr p day gas although vari region keep energi use bill

Dave Ricks urged the next government to consider how it could become ""world class"" in attracting investment

The boss of the world's most valuable pharmaceutical company has told the BBC that the UK's planning system puts companies off investing in the country.

Dave Ricks, chief executive of the obesity drug manufacturer Eli Lilly, said he had considered building a factory in the UK in the last decade, but chose another country instead.

He warned current planning processes were an ""impediment"" to building factories at speed, unlike in the US and Ireland.

""Mostly what they do is they pre-reserve land, they promise to cut through the red tape and layers of government,"" Mr Ricks said.

Eli Lilly, along with its Danish rival Novo Nordisk, has developed a considerable lead over the rest of the pharmaceutical industry when it comes to obesity medication.

Its drugs, which include Zepbound and Mounjaro, are in such demand that the company cannot build factories quickly enough.

The country has operations in the US, Ireland and other European Union countries including Italy, France and Germany.

Mr Ricks said countries that ""could present a path"" in which the time taken to set up a pharmaceutical plant was reduced from five years to two was ""very attractive"".

""In the UK - although I love visiting, it's a wonderful county - it’s not the largest market so you have to overcome that with other attractiveness, whether that be workforce, asset delivery or economic incentives,"" he said.

""You have to be candid, say 'are we as competitive as we can be?' And to date it's been a little bit less, but I think it's not unachievable.""","UK planning laws deter investment, says drugs giantDave Ricks urged the next government to consider how it could become ""world class"" in attracting investmentThe boss of the world's most valuable pharmaceutical company has told the BBC that the UK's planning system puts companies off investing in the country.

Getty Images A lawyer representing families of victims of two fatal Boeing 737 Max crashes says they ""strenuously object to this plea deal""

A lawyer representing victims of two fatal Boeing 737 Max crashes has told the BBC that the US government is preparing to offer the plane maker a ""sweetheart plea deal"". Paul Cassell, who says he got the information ""directly from the Justice Department"", added that the deal includes a small fine, three years of probation and independent safety audits. Boeing did not immediately reply to the BBC's request for comment, while the Justice Department (DoJ) declined to provide a statement. It comes as Boeing announced it had reached a deal to buy the aerospace supplier Spirit AeroSystems - a move it said would improve quality and safety. Spirit made the fuselage that suffered a mid-flight blowout on an Alaska Airlines 737 Max 9 jet in January, sparking widespread concern about standards at Boeing.

'Families will object to this deal'

Last month, US prosecutors recommended that the DoJ bring criminal charges against the plane maker. That was after the DoJ said Boeing had violated a 2021 settlement related to the crashes which killed 346 people. ""The memory of 346 innocents killed by Boeing demands more justice than this,"" said Mr Cassell, adding that the ""families will strenuously object to this plea deal"". The plane crashes - both involving Boeing's 737 Max aircraft - occurred within six months of each other. The crash involving Indonesia's Lion Air occurred in October 2018, followed by an Ethiopian Airlines flight in March 2019. Both crashes were linked to faulty flight control systems. A letter sent last month by Mr Cassell to the DoJ revealed that the families had been seeking prosecutions of Boeing's top executives at the time of the crashes and a fine of $24.8bn (£19.6bn) for ""the deadliest corporate crime in US history"". The Justice Department has until 7 July to decide whether to revive a criminal charge of fraud brought against Boeing in 2021. That charge has lain dormant since the company acknowledged in a settlement that it had misled air-safety regulators about aspects of the 737 Max, and promised to create a new compliance system to detect and prevent further fraud. Under the deal reached in 2021, Boeing said it would pay a $2.5bn settlement and prosecutors agreed to ask the court to drop a criminal charge after three years if the company abided by certain stipulations set out in the deferred prosecution agreement. But in May, the DoJ said Boeing was in breach of the deal, stating that it had failed to ""design, implement, and enforce a compliance and ethics program to prevent and detect violations of the US fraud laws throughout its operations"".","Boeing to get 'sweetheart deal' - victims' lawyer9 hours ago By João da Silva , Business reporter ShareGetty Images A lawyer representing families of victims of two fatal Boeing 737 Max crashes says they ""strenuously object to this plea deal""A lawyer representing victims of two fatal Boeing 737 Max crashes has told the BBC that the US government is preparing to offer the plane maker a ""sweetheart plea deal"".

BBC Qcells is investing billions in a solar panel factory in Georgia

The former “carpet capital of the world” is getting a multi-billion-dollar makeover. Here in the rural Georgian town of Dalton, once known for its fabric floor coverings, a Korean company called Qcells is spending $2.5bn (£2bn) to expand its solar panel factory, with another in the works. It's a bold initiative that will create 2,500 quality jobs in the next 12 months, in an area where the average household income is roughly 27% below the national average. It is hoped the project will revitalise a corner of the US whose glory days seemed over. And it's due in no small part to someone many of the residents of this Republican district would rather not credit - Joe Biden. The president's landmark 2022 Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) – his signature green legislation - offered hundreds of billions of dollars in tax incentives, credits and loans to stimulate American manufacturing in clean energy.

The most ambitious climate legislation in US history has generated a tsunami of private sector investments, with big implications for the rest of the world. And Georgia - a state President Biden hopes is in play in this year’s presidential election - has been a big beneficiary. But with four months before the president goes head-to-head against Donald Trump, the billions of dollars of new investment in this key battleground state doesn’t appear to have lifted the incumbent’s support. President Biden’s pitch is that solving the climate problem is also good for jobs. Since the law was passed, more than 300,000 clean energy jobs have been created in the US, according to the advocacy group Climate Power. And there's no doubt it’s creating opportunities in places like Dalton. Here you see Bidenomics in action - foreign and government money being used to fight climate change and build an economy from the middle out.

Qcells' Scott Moskowitz points to the massive investments in US renewables

Scott Moskowitz, head of market strategy for Qcells, says that Georgia had been a great home since 2019, but that the IRA had been an “accelerant”. Without it, he muses, the current expansion might not have happened at all. “What our industry has seen, since the IRA has passed, is more investment in the past two years in solar and clean energy manufacturing than the previous 20 years,” he says. And yet that message either isn't getting through or simply isn't resonating with locals – not even local Democrats. Jan Pourquoi, the spokesperson for the local Whitfield County Democratic Party, tells me: “In the business community, there is a resentment against that company [Qcells].” Mr Pourquoi, a Belgian expat should know. He owns one of the small carpet firms in town. We spoke in his office, overlooking the factory floor where they turn flooring remnants into small rugs. “The business community resents the fact that we have a company from South Korea coming in this area with government subsidies, while they themselves get nothing from the government,” says Mr Pourquoi, who identified as a Republican before switching parties following Trump’s election in 2016. He tells me that local voters know little about the IRA law. “Nobody cares about clean energy, not around here. That is the type of stuff that I would call the ‘latte liberals’ care about in the big city.”

Qcells Qcells has been expanding its vast factory in Dalton

Well, at least one person does, and that's Marjorie Taylor Greene, the firebrand Republican congressional representative for the district. She has touted Qcells' expansion, despite voting against the law that helped make it possible. It’s creating some awkward dynamics for Republicans. The IRA is in Donald Trump’s sights. If Republican lawmakers win big in the Congressional elections that are also taking place on 5 November, then portions of President Biden’s signature climate law could be repealed, threatening a clean energy boom happening in their communities across the US. I sat down for coffee with Kasey Carpenter, Dalton’s Republican member in the Georgia House of Representatives. We met at Oakwood Café, the bustling diner he owns along with a string of other local businesses, including a pizza joint and a boutique hotel. Mr Carpenter downplayed the potential impact on Qcells of manufacturing tax credits being rolled back. He doesn’t think it would jeopardise the solar investments in his district. But he adds that if clean energy investments were to become at risk “I’m sure we’ll be speaking with the Trump team”. Our conversation ends with him saying it would be another feather in Dalton’s cap if this carpet town could also lay claim to the title of “solar panel capital of the world”.

But that belongs to China, which controls 80% of the world’s solar panel supply chain. For years China has been investing heavily in renewable energy, and is expected to spend a staggering $675bn in 2024, according to an International Energy Agency (IEA) report. To compete, governments around the world have begun throwing hundreds of billions at the green industries of the future. In the EU, investment in clean energy is set to increase to $370bn in 2024, according to the IEA. The predicted figure for the US is $315bn. US Trade Representative Katherine Tai said last year that she hoped the US’s increased spending on renewable energy would help address the “significant distortion” in the global economy caused by China.

Getty Images The former Honda site in Swindon will become a warehousing and logistics facility

Amid a vast expanse of rubble, dust and noise, a green crane yanks away at a corrugated roof like a frustrated dentist attempting to extract a particularly stubborn wisdom tooth. Swindon’s Honda factory - once one of the world’s most advanced car factories - is being demolished, three decades after it opened. This used to be one of the fastest-growing towns in Europe. It was one of the jewels in the crown of investments attracted to the UK by Margaret Thatcher’s brand of 1980s enterprise. Swindon voted for her, John Major, Tony Blair, David Cameron, Theresa May and Boris Johnson. It was also one of the first towns to declare for Brexit, by 55%. But last year, its council changed hands to Labour. The council has had to continue to accelerate cuts to local services, passing a budget with record cuts in order to stave off bankruptcy. Inflation, rising care expenses, and central government grant squeezes meant cuts to libraries, the Dial-a-Ride community transport service and dimmed street lights. There has been an almost 5% rise in council tax. The council leader has warned any further cuts will affect frontline services. What is happening in Swindon is a visible consequence of sluggish long-term economic growth. Government spending cuts, low private investment, deindustrialisation and shrinking disposable income have left scars even on what was one of the UK’s famous boom towns.

The Honda site is set to become a warehousing and logistics facility. In another world, it would have been replaced by another major global manufacturer. Tesla, for example, was invited. Whereas five years ago the promise was to level up left-behind Northern towns, places like Swindon feel levelled down. The question about growth arising in this town is vital to whoever wins Thursday’s election. Elsewhere in the world, sites like this are being repurposed for electric car manufacturing. The Americans are pouring public money into their factories to try to compete with China, who will soon be confirmed as the world’s biggest car exporter. Emerging economies from Indonesia to Vietnam to Turkey are also investing in and growing their car industries. Indeed it was to Turkey that the entire Honda production line, including dozens of never-used industrial robots, was packed up and shipped off via the M4 and Bristol port last year. Swindon is not just about Honda. It is part of the M4 corridor where there are plenty of jobs in the knowledge sectors, and in finance, for example at the headquarters of Nationwide. The overall unemployment rate is just 2.6%, but the number of people not in work and not looking for work is 18%.

Faisal Islam joined Gary Huett, who contacted the BBC as part of the Your Voice, Your Vote election project, for a bike ride around Swindon

Marcus Kittridge, a former Honda engineer who now runs a cafe in the centre of town with his wife Tracey, accepts there are still “good employment prospects” but says many are at or “50p above” minimum wage, and says this has contributed to a decline in disposable income in the centre of town. “It’s like a Northern town that lost its industry in the 1970s,” he tells me. They now shut the cafe at 14:00 every day because of the high price of energy. He expects to be passing on his rising costs in higher prices for the next year or two. They have also stopped selling smoothies, after a notable decline in the availability and quality of fresh fruit, which they blame on post-Brexit changes. “We were told the quality of food was going to go up after Brexit, I can tell you now it has not. I’ve barely heard any politician mention it, but it definitely has had an impact on us,” Tracey says. Might she have been a bit unlucky with her purchases of fresh produce? “If I’m unlucky, I’m getting unlucky every single day and I’m probably the unluckiest person on earth,” she says. Their experience shows that some of the undercurrents of sluggish long-term growth - high energy prices, low disposable income, low investment, and new trade barriers can combine in unusual ways.

Gary Huett, a retired graphic designer also from Swindon who got in touch as part of the BBC's Your Voice, Your Vote project inviting you to tell us what matters, wanted to know why Swindon’s town centre looked like it was “rotting” and asked if anything could change. “We’ve now got pound shops predominantly, and the thriving night scene, packed with the yuppy set in the 1980s and 1990s has gone and decayed.”

Gary Huett wants to know why Swindon's town centre looks like it is ""rotting""

The Conservatives say green shoots are already here. The latest growth figures for January to March show the UK now has the fastest growing economy in the G7 group of advanced economies, after last year’s brief recession. Swindon’s jobs record remains strong. On the Honda site, new investment has come, and the jobs, albeit in warehousing rather than manufacturing, will return. For Labour, Swindon - a bellwether town where residents have voted the same way as the eventual national winner for the last 40 years - shows that there are no quick fixes. They are not competing with the US or European Union (EU) with big public investments in green energy. Council spending remains unprotected and subject to the same ongoing squeeze. A looser planning regime might help build more houses or expand the solar farms that dot the countryside around the town. But the job of transformation is very real. When asked what will happen if the economy does not grow, Labour has responded by saying some variation of “I’m not defeatist” or “we can do it”. When I interviewed shadow chancellor Rachel Reeves in Swindon, I said that if she was relying on planning changes to transform growth prospects, they were going to have to be a revolutionary, almost Thatcher-style ""Big Bang"". She told me: “It’s big reform we are offering… unless we grow the economy we’re going to be stuck in a doom loop of low growth, high taxes and poor public services.” Labour’s hope is that there is a tsunami of private investment that has been held back from this country due to political and economic instability. That, the party says, can be unleashed by the tens of billions with a strong and stable pro-growth government.","Swindon’s Honda factory - once one of the world’s most advanced car factories - is being demolished, three decades after it opened.

Marks & Spencer is launching a new service for clothing repairs and alterations. From August, customers will be able to book through a dedicated online hub and have their fixed items posted back to them within seven to ten days. The work will be carried out by Deliveroo-style repairs start-up Sojo, and its in-house team of tailors, with prices starting at £5. The move comes as retailers try to encourage more sustainable habits among their shoppers.

Sojo launched during the Covid-19 pandemic in 2021 with a mission to make repairing, not simply replacing, clothing more mainstream. M&S said its partnership with Sojo aimed to provide customers with ways to extend the life of their clothing. “Through the launch of our repair service, we’re making it even easier for customers to give their clothes Another life, whether they are using our new repair service or long-standing clothes recycling scheme,"" said Richard Price, managing director of clothing & home at M&S.

Sojo's Josephine Philips wants to make repairing clothes more mainstream

Josephine Philips, Sojo's founder and chief executive, said the partnership marked ""an incredibly big step"" towards its mission of making clothes repairs more accessible. Siobhan Gehin, a retail expert and senior partner at consulting firm Roland Berger, told the BBC that by partnering with smaller, independent repair firms, large brands can provide customers with convenient alterations without having to create the infrastructure for these services themselves.

Growing trend among retailers

M&S is not alone in looking to repair services as a way to seemingly embrace and encourage sustainability. In January, Sojo took up a permanent space in Selfridges on London’s Oxford Street to provide customers with access to its clothing repairs service. The central London department store also gives shoppers access to handbag and trainer restoration services. Japanese fashion retailer Uniqlo, perhaps best known for its viral shoulder bag, offers clothing repairs and additional services such as embroidery for Uniqlo items at six of its UK stores. John Lewis has made its fashion rental service and recycling scheme a key part of its consumer-facing sustainability strategy, alongside accepting and reselling pre-loved products such as electronics and furniture. High Street stores Primark and H&M provide customers with online guides for repairing and maintaining their clothes, such as how to sew buttons and zips on to items or rework them entirely. Primark has also held free repair workshops for customers across the UK and Europe since 2022.

3 days ago Share

BBC

The computer expert who helped build the faulty Horizon software has finally spoken under oath about his involvement in the Post Office scandal. Gareth Jenkins is a key figure, having appeared as an expert witness to defend Horizon in court cases, and is now at the centre of an alleged cover-up. His appearance at the inquiry was long-awaited after being postponed twice. He gave evidence over four days - the longest run of questions any witness has faced - and gave his version of events. Here are five key moments from his evidence.

1. He thought Horizon bugs were fixed quickly

Gareth Jenkins referred to Horizon's overall reliability throughout his testimony, even challenging findings from the landmark Bates v Post Office case that identified issues with the IT system. He acknowledged ""individual problems"" affecting specific branches but asserted that, as a whole, the system was ""working well"". When questioned about bugs, Mr Jenkins admitted lacking personal knowledge of all known issues, stating he typically became involved when drafted in for problem resolution. When pressed on how he could provide court evidence without full oversight of existing problems, Mr Jenkins said: ""Bugs impacting accounts were rare. Monitoring was in place, and fixes were prompt. Therefore, live system problems were rare, making me confident in its operation."" He claimed nobody from the Post Office alerted him to unknown issues, and he didn't actively seek information about bugs he wasn't involved in fixing. Mr Jenkins admitted not realising the need for comprehensive knowledge when giving evidence and ""with hindsight would have done things differently"".

2. He was sent expert witness rules

Mr Jenkins was an “expert witness” in several prosecutions brought by the Post Office. His duty was to the courts, not the Post Office or his employer Fujitsu. His role meant disclosing any relevant information about the Horizon software – even evidence that could help sub-postmasters' cases. Lawyers should have ensured that Mr Jenkins understood this. When asked about this by Mr Beer, Mr Jenkins stated that he didn’t know about his responsibilities until the end of 2020. But Mr Beer showed him a letter from November 2005, written by lawyers working for the Post Office. The letter mentioned that he was an expert witness and, according to Mr Beer, listed his duties in an “easy-to-understand way”. After initially denying he had received it, Mr Jenkins later accepted that it was sent to him. He said he had “no recollection of having been briefed” on his duties and had “clearly forgotten” about having seen the letter.

3. He knew remote access was possible

The former ""distinguished engineer"" faced intense questioning regarding remote access – the ability of Fujitsu staff to modify sub-postmaster branch accounts without their knowledge. In his 2010 witness statement for Seema Misra's trial, he stated: ""No external systems can manipulate branch accounts without user awareness and authorisation."" During the inquiry, Mr Jenkins accepted knowing that remote access was possible but believed it happened infrequently and left a visible trail. He based this view on ""informal chats"" with other Fujitsu IT staff. The former engineer told the inquiry that he only discovered the extent of unrestricted access Fujitsu technical staff had to sub-postmaster accounts during the 2018 High Court battle.

4. He was a 'willing actor' for the Post Office

In 2005, Mr Jenkins was asked to provide a draft witness statement in the case of sub-postmaster Noel Thomas. The Post Office wanted his thoughts on how the losses could have occurred. One possibility, he said, was some sort of system failure. But the Post Office demanded changes, saying the line was potentially “very damaging"". It got deleted. The inquiry heard he was a “willing actor” in this process. He said he was happy with the changes he ended up with as it still accurately reflected what had happened but used “less emotive words"". The Post Office was applying the pressure, but he never checked with his own Fujitsu lawyers about signing off evidence that had been toned down. Earlier he was asked to explain attempts to “tweak” his statements, but Mr Jenkins believed this was more of a “tidying up” to make them easier to read. He said he pushed back when the changes went too far.

5. He was 'better with systems than people'

Four days of forensic questioning meant plenty of room for big revelations. It also meant Gareth Jenkins had nowhere to hide. It was very revealing about the character of the man who has been mentioned so many times at this inquiry. An IT specialist who spent his entire career at one company, by his own admission, he dealt “better with systems than people”. He would have been happiest engineering and designing, but found himself entangled in something very different. Something, he argues, he didn't fully understand. ""Can't you use the report I have already sent you?"" Mr Jenkins wrote to a Post Office lawyer in 2012. It is clear he was viewing the growing number of legal queries as a confusing frustration, taking him away from the tech front line. It is an annoyance that hasn't gone away. At one point, Mr Jenkins told the inquiry chair he wanted this ""over with"". Given the ongoing investigations, that seems unlikely.","What we learned from IT expert at Post Office inquiry3 days ago ShareBBCThe computer expert who helped build the faulty Horizon software has finally spoken under oath about his involvement in the Post Office scandal.

Getty Images Unite workers are set to start striking on 8 July over Tata’s plans to cut 2,800 UK jobs

Tata Steel has offered to meet unions for fresh talks on the condition strike action in south Wales is called off. In a letter to the UK Steel Committee, which represents the Community, Unite and the GMB unions, the company is believed to have offered to discuss future investment in Port Talbot. But the unions would be required to suspend future industrial action. Unite general secretary Sharon Graham told BBC Wales: ""They suspend closure, we suspend action.""

Unite workers are set to start striking on 8 July over Tata’s plans to cut 2,800 UK jobs. The union wants the company to delay the closure of the heavy end of steel production in Port Talbot, which is due to happen by the end of September. Community and GMB have a mandate from their members for strike action but have not confirmed any dates, saying they would wait until after the general election before announcing their next moves. The offer to start fresh talks with the unions follows discussions between Tata and Unite in the days since announcing the proposal to bring forward the closures of both Port Talbot blast furnaces. On Thursday the company said it would close both furnaces this week unless it could ""safely and stably operate"" them during the strike. On Sunday it wrote to all three unions, offering to begin new talks if the strike was called off. The talks are not a renegotiation of the existing plan, but focus on future investment opportunities. Alun Davies, Community’s national officer, said the letter ""simply reaffirms"" the position agreed by the unions and Tata at their last meeting on 22 May, and did not constitute a new agreement in response to Unite's actions. Unite had previously pulled away from multi-union talks, and was the only union to launch industrial action. Mr Davies said it was ""welcome"" Unite were ""reaffirming their commitment to the position they previously agreed"", that unions would agree on a memorandum of understanding before putting it to members to vote on.

3 days ago By Lora Jones , Business reporter, BBC News Share

Lawyers acting on behalf of two people who fell ill in an E. coli outbreak in the UK have started legal action against two leading supermarkets. Law firm Fieldfisher said on Friday it had issued letters of claim for breach of the Consumer Protection Act over own-brand sandwiches purchased in Tesco and Asda. The claims for compensation relate to a man from the South East and an 11-year-old girl in the North West. One person in England has died linked to the ongoing E. coli outbreak, the UK Health Security Agency said on Thursday, although they had underlying health conditions. The E. coli outbreak is thought to be caused by some supermarket sandwiches containing salad leaves. The large majority of cases reported so far developed symptoms before 4 June and the number of cases being reported is now falling, offering hope the outbreak may have ended. Several food manufacturers recalled some of their products as a precaution. The Food Standards Agency said lettuce is the likely source, based on tests.

Fieldfisher said the claim against Asda related to a young girl who contracted E. coli after eating an own-brand chicken salad sandwich from the supermarket. ""The girl, aged 11, developed the serious condition haemolytic uraemic syndrome (HUS), which attacks the kidneys and has been on dialysis for three weeks,"" it said. ""She was discharged home two days ago but could be at risk of permanent kidney damage. Her mother bought three of the sandwiches as part of an online delivery."" An Asda spokesman said that it had not yet received any letter from Fieldfisher regarding these claims, but added: ""As soon as we do we will review the details of the claim as a matter of urgency."" Harvinder Kaur, a director at Fieldfisher, told the PA News agency earlier on Friday that she had issued a separate letter to Tesco on behalf of a man from the South East. He was also hospitalised with E. coli symptoms after eating Tesco-branded sandwiches containing salad, the law firm claims. ""Luckily, this client did not go on to develop HUS and is now home, but for a time he was seriously ill,"" she said. ""Under the Act, companies producing food must ensure it is safe to eat. ""If it causes illness, it is a breach of their duty and those injured are eligible to claim compensation, not least to fund possible ongoing medical care."" She added that the man was a ""regular shopper"" at Tesco, buying his lunch there most weekdays as it was very close to his work. The BBC understands Tesco has yet to receive the letter from Fieldfisher.

1 day ago By Angie Brown , BBC Scotland, Edinburgh and East reporter Share

BBC Jakub Parulski, who lives with his wife and two young daughters, said they were in a 'horror story'

Residents of affordable housing developments in Edinburgh have said they are ""living in a horror story"" after being hit with a massive rise in their gas bill as costs are beginning to fall across the rest of the country. The Harvester's Way development has 180 properties which are all connected to a district heating system, where one huge gas boiler provides heating and hot water to all the homes. It is billed as a greener and more efficient way to heat their homes but it also means residents are unable to shop around for the best prices. Places For People Scotland, which operates about 1,000 homes across five sites in Edinburgh, has told residents the tariff for gas will jump 450% from 1 August, meaning people in a two-bedroom flat could be paying as much as £400 a month. It said the new heat tariff was procured at the end of last year and reflected the market conditions at the time. The unit price for gas can vary significantly and energy companies also impose standing charges, but the average UK unit price is currently just above 7p per kWh. The Harvester's Way residents were paying 4p/kWh but that is increasing to 22.18p/kWh.

Some of the residents from People For Places developments in Edinburgh who say they cannot pay their new gas bill prices

Jakub Parulski, who lives on the development with his wife Kasia and two young daughters, said his monthly gas bill will rise from £60 to £350. He said: ""These properties were aimed at affordable housing for low income families, this is not affordable by any means and we are very anxious about this. ""The problem is we can't boycott paying because we have pre-payment, pay-as-you go meters so they have us locked. ""We have no choice. The only choice we have is if we go cold with our small kids in the property."" The low carbon heating and hot water district heat network has a smart valve in each home linking payments to access to heating and hot water. As long as their account is in credit, the valve will remain open and they have access to heating and hot water. If an account runs out of credit, the valve closes until a top-up payment is made. Mr Parulski said he would not be able to sell his house because no-one would buy a property with such a high gas tariff. ""We are absolutely devastated. We are going to be locked in properties we cannot afford,"" he said. ""People will lose their homes. Some of us are looking at being homeless, some of us are nosediving into poverty. ""It is impossible now for us to sell our properties. We feel trapped and this is beginning to be a horror story and is no joke for a lot of us. ""It is really desperate.""

Henda Sankareh said she got the ""fright of her life"" at the new gas prices

The price rise was first introduced in April but delayed after residents complained. They told BBC Scotland the first they knew about their tariff changing was when credit in their pay-as-you-go meters suddenly dropped overnight. When Henda Sankareh noticed she had no hot water to wash her four-month-old baby at her rented flat on the Harvester's Way development she thought the boiler was broken. So the mother-of-two called the managers running the development to report the fault. But the 30-year-old said she got the ""fright of her life"" when they told her there was no problem with the heating and instead she had just run out of credit. She checked her meter and was shocked to see her monthly instalment had disappeared in less than a week. She said: ""They just told me the price had gone up so I needed to put more money in the meter. ""That's when I got into a panic. All the money had gone in just five days. I had had no notice or letter or email to warn me.""

Scott Walker with his wife Samantha and daughter Molly

After residents complained they had been given no warning Places for People Scotland launched an investigation. The company agreed to pay the higher tariff bill until the end of July but then residents would be locked into the new rates until the end of March 2025. In a letter to residents, it said: ""The procurement process requires us to adhere to terms and conditions known as the deed of conditions, which states we must get at least five cost quotes for price comparison before agreeing on a provider. ""Due to difficulties in finding gas suppliers for district heating, many providers chose not to participate."" Scott Walker, 50, a quality control technician living on the Harvester's Way development, said: ""I got a fright and felt very angry when I did the figures in my head and realised this was impossible to pay. ""We can't afford to move. He added: ""When we bought this house we were told this heating system was really efficient. ""We need to try to reduce the tariff. Obviously it has to go up but not that kind of percentage. It's extortionate. We would take a normal price that everyone else pays.

The economy grew by more than initially estimated in the first three months of 2024 as the UK emerged from recession, revised official figures show.

Between January and March, the economy grew by 0.7% the Office for National Statistics (ONS) said.

Figures released last month initially estimated growth had been 0.6%.

The strength of the economy has been a central battleground in the general election campaign, with growth having been sluggish in recent years.

Most economists, politicians and businesses want to see GDP rising steadily, because it usually means people are spending more, extra jobs are created, more tax is paid to the government and workers get better pay rises.

The original figure for the first quarter of the year was stronger than economists had expected, and growth in the services sector, which includes businesses such as hairdressers, banks, and hospitality, helped to push it higher, the ONS said.

But while services growth was revised upwards, increases in manufacturing were revised down on the back of more data being collected.

Due to the upward revision, the UK was the fastest growing economy in the G7 group of countries with advanced economies in the first three months of this year.

Prime Minister and Conservative leader Rishi Sunak hailed the new revised growth and said his party had a ""clear plan to deliver a more secure future for your family"".

But Labour accused the Conservatives of ""14 years economic vandalism"", which it said had left people worse off.

""A Labour government will grow the economy and show Britain is open for business with a plan for growth, so that we can put money back in people’s pockets,"" said a spokesperson.

Sarah Olney, Liberal Democrat Treasury spokesperson, said despite the upward revision, the figures would ""come as cold comfort for families being hammered by spiralling mortgage repayments, unfair stealth taxes and the cost of a weekly food shop going through the roof"".","UK economy grew more than estimated in early 2024The economy grew by more than initially estimated in the first three months of 2024 as the UK emerged from recession, revised official figures show.

3 days ago By Mark Palmer , BBC News Share

Getty Images The company had originally planned to shut down one of the blast furnaces by the end of June and the second by September

Workers at Tata Steel have been told the company is taking steps to potentially cease operations at much of the Port Talbot plant by 7 July because of a strike by the trade union Unite. The company had originally been planning to shut one of the blast furnaces by the end of June and the second one by September. But Port Talbot workers have been told that because of the strike from 8 July, the company can no longer be assured of sufficient resources being available to ensure safe and stable operations. The Unite union said Tata's statement to shut or pause the blast furnaces three months earlier than intended was the latest in a long line of threats and it would not deter them. The Welsh government said it cannot and will not support the closure of both blast furnaces.

Last week the Unite union announced that about 1,500 workers would begin an indefinite strike on 8 July over the company's plans to cut thousands of jobs. Onay Kasab, the national lead for Unite, told Radio Wales Breakfast that the union was due to have a conversation with the company regarding safety during the strike. Mr Kasab denied if the union had given the company an opportunity to shut the site. ""What other option have we got when we are facing 2,800 job losses. We have said to Tata, again and again, 'wait for a general election, wait for a new Labour government'"" he said. Mr Kasab said the union have a letter from the company asking the union to wait until after the general election for discussions to take place. However, the company previously said it would not be changing course in Port Talbot, regardless of who wins the general election. About 2,800 Tata Steel workers will lose their jobs when the company closes both blast furnaces in Port Talbot by the end of September. At the time, the company said if the strike affected the safety or stability of its operations it would be ""forced"" to accelerate closure plans. A spokesperson for Tata said: ""Following the announcement by Unite union to unilaterally call strike action from 8 July, Tata Steel is unfortunately forced to commence legal action to challenge the validity of Unite's ballot. ""In the coming days, if we cannot be certain that we are able to continue to safely and stably operate our assets through the period of strike action, we will not have any choice but to pause or stop heavy end operations [including both blast furnaces] on the Port Talbot site. ""That is not a decision we would take lightly, and we recognise that it would prove extremely costly and disruptive throughout the supply chain, but the safety of people on or around our sites will always take priority over everything else."" Tata said it is again calling on Unite to withdraw its industrial action and join Community and GMB unions in ""giving consideration"" to the company's proposal, which Tata said includes ""generous employee support packages, training and skills development"". It said it ""understands"" the impact the restructuring will have on many employees and contractors, but that it ""remains committed to a just transition"" and hopes for a ""long and sustainable future"" in the UK. The company plans to build a £1.25bn electric arc furnace to produce steel in a way which is less polluting than traditional blast furnaces but requires fewer workers. Tata said the move would secure the future of steelmaking at the site and the UK government is contributing £500m towards the cost of the project. The plans for the site will see both furnaces shut down. Number five will go off by the end of next week as planned while four is due to go off by the end of September. Preparatory work to shut down five will begin by 1 July if the strike goes ahead. Other elements that will close include the harbour, sinter plant, ore yards and primary steelmaking.

PA Media Unite union workers are protesting against Tata Steel's plans to cut 2,800 jobs

Sharon Graham, the Unite general secretary, said the union is ""fighting for the future of the steel industry"". She said Unite has secured ""serious investment"" from Labour to safeguard jobs. ""Tata putting out a statement to shut or pause its blast furnaces three months earlier than they intended to is the latest in a long line of threats that won't deter us. ""The Unite campaign is not about selling jobs, it's about securing the long-term future of steel making in this country for thousands of workers in Port Talbot and South Wales."" Unite said it is calling on the ""real decision makers"" in Mumbai to realise that ""the investment secured will be good for the company and workers."" GMB union said Tata must ""step back"" from this ""irreversible decision"" and instead ""safeguard steelmaking assets"". GMB national officer, Charlotte Brumpton-Childs, said that the upcoming general election could ""change so much"", and that GMB's next actions would be decided by its members. The Community union condemned Tata's ""unacceptable"" decision to bring forward the closure and said it continued to support the Labour Party's call for Tata not to make irreversible decisions before the general election.

Analysis by Ben Price, BBC Wales News

Developments have escalated quickly in the past two weeks. Unite is one of three unions which represents steelworkers and it has so far been the most militant in its action in the face of significant job cuts across Tata’s UK operations. Members are currently working to rule and there’s a ban on any overtime. However, the decision to walk out indefinitely is an escalation which now potentially threatens the early closure of the UK’s largest steelmaking operation in Port Talbot. Tata says it would have no option but to close if the strike goes ahead, but in the meantime the company has filed for an injunction at the High Court to try to prevent the strike happening. It suggests Unite’s ballot on industrial action wasn’t carried out properly. With the action due on 8 July, Tata will need a ruling quickly. The other unions, Community and GMB, say they’ll wait until after the general election before deciding whether to strike too. But having spoken to a number of steelworkers in Port Talbot, the sense is that many don’t want a strike which could cost them the current offer on the table from the company. What happens during the course of the next week could be crucial to the future of thousands of livelihoods, although Tata says no redundancies will be made until the end of September, regardless.

Workers and local people have protested about the closure plans

First Minister Vaughan Gething described the news from Tata as ""extraordinary"" and urged the company to wait for the result of next week's general election. In a statement, Mr Gething said: ""The news that Tata could switch off blast furnaces four and five at Port Talbot next week is extraordinary and will cause huge anxiety for the workforce, their families and the community. ""The Welsh government cannot and will not support the closure of both blast furnaces"". He added that acting whilst the nation went to the polls did not help de-escalate matters. Samuel Kurtz, the Welsh Conservative shadow minister for economy and energy,said it was ""disappointing news that will cause additional distress to communities already dealing with enough as it is"". ""Tata have shown no goodwill to their workforce at what is an anxious time. “The Welsh Labour government have also only paid lip service to Tata's workforce, failing to contribute a penny to the transition board, and UK Labour's manifesto says nothing on what it would do differently to support Port Talbot's steelworkers,"" he added. Luke Fletcher, Plaid Cymru's economy spokesperson, said steel should be brought under the control of the next UK government, which Plaid believes will be led by Sir Keir Starmer. Mr Fletcher said: ""The time has come now for an incoming Labour government to put words into action on steel. ""Save our steel is no good as just a slogan, if we are going to save our steel, nationalisation needs to happen on day one.""","The Welsh government said it cannot and will not support the closure of both blast furnaces.

3 days ago Share

Getty Images Aer Lingus have now cancelled almost 400 flights

Aer Lingus has confirmed it is cancelling a further 122 flights up until 7 July due to the ongoing industrial action by pilots. The airline has now cancelled almost 400 flights as a result of an indefinite work-to-rule and strike action by pilots. The work-to-rule means not working over time or carrying out any other out-of-hours duties. An eight-hour strike from 05:00 -13:00 local time is planned for Saturday. Aer Lingus said that due to the “indefinite nature” of Irish Air Line Pilots' Association pilots’ industrial action it “must cancel” additional flights up to 7 July.

RTE Dublin Airport on the first day of industrial action

Irish broadcaster RTÉ had reported that the recommendation for an additional strike was made by IALPA on Thursday. However, on Friday afternoon, Capt Mark Tighe, president of the union, said that Ireland's Labour Court has invited both parties in the dispute to return to them on Monday afternoon. ""We are in the process of discussing that and that of course would have relevance to whether or not we escalate the industrial action,"" he told Radio Ulster's Evening Extra programme. ""I’m hoping now that they have noted the seriousness of the situation and that they’ll be able to apply their considerable expertise."" Talks between it and Aer Lingus to resolve the ongoing pay dispute broke down without a resolution on Thursday.

School pupils 'slept on floor'

A group of students and teachers from Shimna Integrated School in County Down who were retuning from a trip to Berlin had their flight home cancelled while they were in the airport. Teacher Luke McWatters, said that their 21:45 flight on Thursday was initially showing as delayed and then, more than two hours after the flight was initially due to take off, they were told it was cancelled. “Trying to ring through to Aer Lingus I was on three different calls to three different agents who, every time I got to a certain way through said: ‘Because you’re a group we can’t do anything for you -you have to contact group Aer Lingus who don’t open until 9am’.” Mr McWatters told the BBC’s Evening Extra programme that he felt they had been “left high and dry”, with no offer of accommodation or food.

Luke McWatters Luke McWatters said support from the airline ""fell short"" of what was expected

He said the group slept on the airport floor. Mr McWatters said they were offered an alternative flight on 1 July. “At that stage we made the call to try other airlines and split ourselves up as a group,” he added. Half of the group travelled to Edinburgh, while the other half caught a flight to Poland, with both groups booked on flights back to Ireland on Friday. Mr McWatters said that the support for Aer Lingus had “fallen very short of what you would expect from a major airline dealing with children”. The BBC has contacted Aer Lingus for a response.

'Reasonable pay claim'

Capt Tighe said ""passengers are extremely dear to us as pilots. Management don’t meet you, we do every day. ""We’ve been left in a position where our pay is being eroded and all we’re looking to do is maintain our pay."" Speaking to BBC News NI's Good Morning Ulster programme on Friday, Capt Tighe said in an effort to resolve the dispute, the union had said it would accept less than an inflationary rise. ""We don’t believe anybody should be getting less than inflation, but yesterday in an effort to resolve this, we said we would accept less than inflation."" However, he added: ""We believe inflation is a very reasonable claim in this current time.""

PA Media IALPA President Capt Mark Tighe said the Labour Court has invited both sides to further discussions on Monday

Additional strike action?

IALPA had recommended to trade union Fórsa that the additional strike should be longer than the action planned for Saturday, RTÉ has reported. If sanctioned, Fórsa will have to give seven days’ notice to Aer Lingus before pilots can stop work. Aer Lingus has described the potential of further strike action as ""entirely inappropriate given the request of the Labour Court this week that the dispute should not be escalated"". Donal Moriarty, Aer Lingus' chief corporate affairs officer, said the airline is ""willing to go back to the Labour Court on a formal joint referral basis"". He said Aer Lingus has encouraged IALPA and Fórsa to ""agree to this step"".

How many Aer Lingus flights have been cancelled?

All Aer Lingus UK regional flights, operated by Emerald Airlines, and Aer Lingus UK transatlantic flights to and from Manchester will operate as scheduled. A full list of cancelled flights can be found on the airline's website.

How much are Aer Lingus pilots paid?

Co-pilots can start out at about €36,000 (£30,400), with packages increasing based on actual flying hours. Irish broadcaster RTÉ has reported a captain at the top of the scale can be paid about €287,000 (£242,000). Capt Mark Tighe explained on Thursday that this can take up to 26 years. There are differences for pilots depending on whether flights are short or long-haul.

3 days ago By Tom Espiner , BBC business reporter Share

BBC

Former Fujitsu engineer and Horizon expert Gareth Jenkins has said he didn't think the software was ""a monster"" and that he was ""trapped into doing things I shouldn't have done"". Speaking at an inquiry into the Horizon scandal, Mr Jenkins was accused by lawyer Flora Page of ""protecting"" it when he gave evidence as an expert witness between 2010 and 2013. Ms Page represents Horizon victims including former sub-postmaster Seema Misra, who Mr Jenkins gave evidence against in 2010. Ms Misra told the BBC the system was a monster which ""had blood on its hands, and so do the people who protect [it]"".

Between 1999 and 2015, the Post Office prosecuted hundreds of sub-postmasters on the strength of faulty Horizon data, with 700 convicted of offences such as theft and false accounting. Horizon falsely flagged discrepancies in accounts, with many sub-postmasters using their own savings to make good the imaginary shortfalls. The wrongful prosecutions, which have been called one of the biggest British miscarriages of justice, had a devastating effect on the lives of the sub-postmasters affected. They faced financial ruin and the loss of standing in their communities. Some sub-postmasters ended up taking their own lives after being pursued by the Post Office for supposed losses, including Martin Griffiths, whose widow was later paid in instalments by the Post Office for her silence, the inquiry heard in April.

Giving his fourth day of evidence at the inquiry into the Horizon scandal, Mr Jenkins was questioned by Ms Page, a barrister who represented Horizon victims including Seema Misra. Ms Misra was pregnant with her second child when she was convicted of theft and sent to jail in 2010. She later told the BBC she would have killed herself had she not been pregnant at the time. In a charged atmosphere at the hearing, with Ms Misra sitting next to her, Ms Page accused Mr Jenkins of being a ""Fujitsu man"". She said Mr Jenkins ""knew the Misra trial was a test case for Horizon"". Ms Page alleged his role was to make sure Horizon had a ""clean bill of health"" and that he had ""tailored"" his evidence accordingly. ""My role was to tell the truth,"" Mr Jenkins said. ""I attempted to answer as best I could the questions I was asked"". Ms Page responded: ""Never mind whether a by-product of protecting the monster was that a woman was sent to jail"". Mr Jenkins said he was ""sorry for had happened to Mrs Misra"" but he felt that was down the to way that the Post Office had behaved and wasn't ""purely down to me"". ""I clearly got trapped into doing things I shouldn't have done, but that was not intentional on my behalf,"" he said.

Mr Jenkins was part of the Fujitsu team that developed the Horizon software, and part of his role was dealing with bugs in the system. Mr Jenkins has maintained throughout his evidence that he didn't understand his previous duties as an expert witness to tell the court about problems with Horizon, and that he didn't know that he shouldn't just narrowly answer questions about the technology. Under questioning at the inquiry on Friday, Mr Jenkins said: ""I appreciate that I got things very wrong, but it was done through ignorance rather than maliciousness"". He added that the Horizon system ""as a whole was working well"".

Thousands of UK bank customers were hit by payment problems affecting some of the biggest High Street lenders on Friday.

Banks including HSBC, Nationwide, Barclays and Virgin Money were all affected by issues with a system that operates payments between individuals and firms.

The group overseeing the payments system said the issue causing the problems has now been fixed, and the payment backlog has been cleared.

However, several people have told the BBC they are still facing issues, with some saying they now have little cash left.

The timing of the glitches was particularly problematic given the last Friday of the month is when many salaried staff are usually paid.

Many people also have to pay bills around this time.

""My bills are bouncing and I can’t pay for a train ticket I need in the next hour,"" said one customer on X.

Another said customers deserved compensation for the ""inconvenience on people’s pay day"".

""We all have bills to pay,"" they added.

Ryan, from Telford, who did not want his surname to be used, said he had not received his wages and as a result has £12 to his name.

The 29-year-old engineer said bills had started to be declined on his account.

""I’m supposed to be moving home next week and my savings have been emptied for deposits and rent,"" he said.

The BBC understands that the banks were affected by issues to Faster Payments, a system that operates ""under the bonnet"" of the UK financial system.

It aims to make sure real-time payments between millions of individuals and businesses are made seemingly instantly.

Pay UK, which oversees the system, said: ""We are aware that a small number of Faster Payments were delayed or not processed earlier today.

""Working with our infrastructure provider, this technical issue has been fixed.""

It then added later that ""payments have returned to normal and the backlog is resolved"".

However, some banking customers have disputed this, telling the BBC they have still yet to receive their salary payments.

HSBC, Nationwide, Barclays and Virgin Media had all apologised earlier for the delays to payments.

This is not the first time High Street lenders' services have been hit by problems.

Nationwide customers faced similar issues in March, while HSBC customers suffered an outage lasting over 24 hours in November.","Major UK high street banks say payment issues fixedThousands of UK bank customers were hit by payment problems affecting some of the biggest High Street lenders on Friday.

Nike shares plunged more than 12% in after hours trading

Nike has said it expects a surprise 10% drop in quarterly revenue, as it faces growing competition from newer rivals such as On and Hoka.

The news sent Nike shares plunging more than 12% in after hours trading, which could mean a loss of $15bn in market value if the losses hold on Friday.

The world's largest sportswear company also told investors it is facing weakening demand in international markets, including in China.

But Nike is optimistic that new products and a marketing campaign at the upcoming Olympic Games in Paris will help the company regain momentum with consumers.

""The Paris Olympics offers us a pinnacle moment to communicate our vision of sport to the world,"" CEO John Donahoe said on the earnings call.

The company also lowered its outlook for the 2025 fiscal year.

It said direct-to-consumer business declined 8%, as some customers went for more trendy upstart brands.

""There's a sense that Nike just hasn't innovated enough, it hasn't marketed enough, it hasn't told enough stories around its products,"" the Managing director of GlobalData Retail, Neil Saunders, told the BBC.

The sportswear giant's strategy to sell its products through its own stores and website instead of wholesales like Foot Locker hurt sales, Reuters said.

""Nike needs to get on the front foot again in terms of persuading people to buy its products,"" Mr Saunders added.

Prosecutors say through their actions the employees avoided losses ranging from $24,000 to more than$108,000.

Three employees of subsidiaries of HYBE, the agency behind K-pop superstars BTS, have been charged with insider trading by South Korean prosecutors.

They are being accused of selling shares in the agency before BTS members announced they were taking a break on 14 June, 2022.

The announcement sent HYBE shares plunging 25% when markets opened, resulting in a loss in market value of nearly 2 trillion won ($1.4bn; £1.1bn).

The prosecutors said the three employees acted with prior knowledge of what was about to happen, avoiding losses ranging from $24,000 to more than $108,000.

At the time, many analysts speculated about the reasons for the hiatus, with some saying the band members would have to attend South Korea's mandatory 18-month military service.

South Korea is still technically at war with North Korea, so nearly all able-bodied men are obliged to enlist for 18 months by the time they turn 28.

All members of the band would end up being drafted in the months and years that followed.

The oldest member of the hit boy band, Jin, was discharged earlier this month after completing his service.

The other six - J-Hope, V, RM, Jimin, Jung Kook and Suga - are still serving and the band is expected to reunite only in June 2025.

An electric car battery developed by UK start-up Nyobolt has successfully charged from 10% to 80% in four minutes and 37 seconds in its first live demonstration.

It was achieved with a specially-built concept sports car on a test track in Bedford, and is part of industry-wide efforts to get electric vehicles (EVs) charging more quickly.

By comparison, an existing Tesla supercharger can charge a car battery to 80% in 15-20 minutes.

Experts say eliminating so-called ""range anxiety"" is key to increasing uptake of EVs - but also stress the importance of improving the charging infrastructure.

“Developing technology that enables people to charge more quickly, which chimes with the time it currently takes to re-fuel a car – is really important,"" Paul Shearing, Professor of Sustainable Energy Engineering at Oxford University, told the BBC.

But he added there needed to be more chargers of all types.

“People are going to want fast-charging infrastructure, independent of what car they’re using – everyone wants to do this more quickly,” he said.

4 days ago By Natalie Sherman , BBC News Share

EPA Campaigners and family members of those who have died of opioids outside the US Supreme Court

The US Supreme Court has struck down a part of the bankruptcy deal for Purdue Pharma that would have shielded members of the Sackler family from future lawsuits over their role in fuelling the opioid crisis. The Sacklers, who owned and operated the Oxycontin-maker for decades, had agreed to pay $6bn (£4.7bn) towards a wider settlement in exchange for sweeping protections against civil claims related to the addictive opioid. But the nation's top court ruled that granting such protections to the Sacklers, who did not themselves declare bankruptcy was not authorised under law. Sackler family members said they would continue to push for a settlement, warning that the alternative was ""costly and chaotic legal proceedings in courtrooms across the country"". The ruling is a victory for the US government and others who had challenged the deal, arguing that releasing the Sacklers was a misuse of the system. But it raises major questions about the future of the agreement, which had won significant, if mixed, support from many who sued the company and saw it as the only practical way to reach the family's billions for drug treatment and other uses. Ellen Isaacs, whose son Patrick Ryan Wroblewski died of an overdose in 2018 at the age of 33, was one of the family members who had opposed the shield for the Sacklers. She said she was not sure what came next, but was hopeful that justice would be done. ""I'd like to see them held fully accountable,"" she said. ""I'm just so grateful to the Supreme Court right now I can't get beyond that.""

Reuters Oxycontin, often an entryway into harder drugs, such as heroin, has been blamed for driving the opioid crisis

Purdue became a household name in the US as the maker and promoter of OxyContin - a prescription painkiller it promoted as safe, despite being aware it was both highly addictive and widely abused. The company declared bankruptcy in 2019, after it was hit by thousands of lawsuits brought by states, cities and families. It later pleaded guilty to criminal charges, including defrauding health agencies and making illegal payments to doctors. The kind of shield granted to the Sacklers in this deal has been a critical feature of other high-profile settlements, including those involving Boy Scouts of America and the Catholic Church. But courts have been divided as to whether such ""releases"" from liability for third parties like the Sacklers are actually permitted. In asking the Supreme Court to take up the issue, lawyers for the US government said letting it stand ""would leave in place a roadmap for wealthy corporations and individuals to misuse the bankruptcy system"" and escape accountability. Writing for the 5-4 majority, Justice Neil Gorsuch echoed those concerns. ""The Sacklers have not agreed to place anything approaching their full assets on the table for opioid victims, "" he wrote. ""Yet they seek a judicial order that would extinguish virtually all claims against them for fraud, willful injury, and even wrongful death, all without the consent of those who have brought and seek to bring such claims."" The court noted that the Sacklers, who have long denied wrongdoing, ""seek to pay less than the code ordinarily requires and receive more than it normally permits"".

Oxycontin, often an entryway into harder drugs, such as heroin, has been blamed for driving the opioid crisis. Since 1999, a few years after the drug became available, deaths from opioid overdoses have surged eightfold to more than 80,000 annually. Court filings allege the Sackler family was long aware of the legal risks, and withdrew some $11bn from the company in the decade before its bankruptcy. They stashed much of the money overseas, while using some of it to pay company taxes, making recovery difficult. When the Supreme Court heard arguments last year, dozens of protesters opposing the deal showed up, holding signs such as ""my dead son does not release the Sacklers"". But many others had backed the deal, willing to accept the terms if the result was billions of dollars for treatment, as well as $750m that would go directly to opioid victims, estimated at $3,500-$48,000 each.

4 days ago By Tom Espiner , BBC business reporter Share

Alamy Thursday was the third day the inquiry heard from Gareth Jenkins. He will conclude his oral evidence on Friday

A Fujitsu software expert who helped build the Horizon system has said he felt pressurised by the Post Office over evidence he gave in the 2010 prosecution of sub-postmistress Seema Misra. Gareth Jenkins said the Post Office ""clearly"" wanted him to say that ""everything was perfect, and I don't think I actually said that"". However, in an email discussing the case at the time, he said Mrs Misra had ""jumped on the bandwagon"" in blaming Horizon for shortfalls in accounts. Mrs Misra told the BBC that this was an example of a culture that went ""right through the Post Office... [that] Horizon is perfect"".

Mrs Misra was one of hundreds of sub-postmasters and postmistresses prosecuted by the Post Office between 1999 and 2015 on the strength of faulty data from the Horizon accounting system. The technology made it look as though money was missing from Post Office branch accounts when it wasn't. At Mrs Misra's trial in 2010 she was accused of theft and false accounting. The sub-postmistress from West Byfleet, Surrey, was found guilty and sent to prison when she was eight weeks pregnant. Her conviction was quashed in 2021.

Mr Jenkins said he felt, prior to the prosecution, that he was being pressurised by the Post Office to make out that Horizon was ""perfect"" in commenting on a report written by an expert witness for the defence. He added that the management of Mrs Misra's case was ""fairly chaotic"", and that requests from the Post Office legal department had been unclear. Nevertheless, in an email discussing Mrs Misra's case in 2010, he wrote that Mrs Misra ""saw an article in [tech publication] Computer Weekly indicating that Horizon was unreliable and decided to jump on the bandwagon"". Mr Jenkins said this was ""totally inappropriate wording"" and apologised. Lead counsel for the inquiry Jason Beer asked Mr Jenkins whether he had been able to give evidence dispassionately, or had he been ""afflicted"" with the belief that sub-postmasters were jumping on the bandwagon in blaming Horizon for shortfalls. Mr Jenkins said that he didn't think Horizon was the problem, and that there were ""other reasons"" for shortfalls. Responding to Mr Jenkins' evidence, Mrs Misra said she felt that the former Fujitsu engineer's comments showed the culture in the Post Office at the time, which was that sub-postmasters were to blame for shortfalls, rather than Horizon being at fault.

Guidance sought

The inquiry was also shown an email sent on 27 January 2010 where Mr Jenkins had read a report on a separate prosecution and wrote that Horizon data “probably needs some further investigation”. However, he said the decision to do so would be “highly political”. ""We don't really want to be seen to be undermining a Post Office prosecution!"" he wrote. Mr Jenkins said he wanted guidance from senior management on ""what exactly we should be doing"". Mr Beer asked: ""Why did you need guidance on whether or not Fujitsu should just present the facts irrespective of whether they supported or undermined a Post Office prosecution?"" Mr Jenkins replied: ""The guidance I got was to just tell the truth, which is what I would have liked to have done anyway."" ""Did you need guidance from management on whether you should tell the truth or not?"" Mr Beer asked. Mr Jenkins said he would just tell the truth, but said he needed guidance from management on whether he was covered by management in this. Mr Beer asked: ""You needed top cover for telling the truth?"" Mr Jenkins responded: ""I don't know what to say to that."" Mr Jenkins is being investigated by the Metropolitan Police for suspected perjury - lying to court.

Delia-Ioana/BBC News Delia-Ioana said she can't imagine being able to afford a mortgage

The average cost of renting privately in England has risen by nearly a quarter since the last general election. In December 2019 rent cost £1,064 a month on average according to the Office for National Statistics (ONS). By May 2024 this had risen by 22% to £1,301 for new and existing tenancies. Renters have told the BBC they have settled for mouldy properties, sofa-surfed or moved back in with relatives. The National Residential Landlords Association blamed a “chronic shortage” of private rental homes on high interest rates prompting landlords to leave the market. Hundreds of people have been in touch with the BBC about rent via Your Voice, Your Vote.

'All of us have been homeless'

Delia-Ioana, a 24-year-old freelance production assistant, pays £567 per month for a flat share in Bristol. She said it took eight months for a dripping tap to be fixed, impacting her water bills, and the walls were mouldy and damp with mineral deposits. Delia-Ioana plans to move out soon, but said rent was often too expensive, and she worried about the future. “I was looking at my friends – all of us have been homeless at some point. A floor here, a sofa there,” she said. “How are we going to afford to have children if we can’t afford a house?” Average rents in Bristol rose 34% between December 2019 and May 2024, from £1,312 to £1,759 per month, the eighth largest increase among local authorities in England.

Why has rent been increasing?

Between December 2019 and May 2024, average private rent in England rose by 22% according to the Office for National Statistics (ONS). It used a ""geometric average"" to account for differences in property types and changes in the rental markets. Across a similar period (April 2019 to April 2024) the Institute for Fiscal Studies estimated UK earnings rose by 4-6% in real terms. The Bank of England started raising interest rates in December 2021, pushing mortgages up. It has kept them at 5.25% since last summer, aiming to slow the pace of rising prices. Richard Donnell, property company Zoopla’s executive head of research, said these increases have made it harder for potential first-time buyers. According to Mr Donnell there are fewer private landlords, meaning the total number of rental homes in the UK has barely changed since 2016 - but demand has continued to soar. “The big increase in demand happened after the pandemic ended and the economy reopened,"" he said. ""You had this big return of people to cities, the international borders reopened.” He said the growth of working from home has made cheaper areas outside big cities more appealing.

Where has rent increased the most?

London has the highest average rent in England. But Tameside in Greater Manchester saw the largest percentage increase, up by more than 40% - from £555 in December 2019, to £780 in May 2024. Six Greater Manchester local authorities were among the areas with the biggest percentage rises in England.

'It was like a bidding war'

Luisa, a civil servant renting in Tameside, lived with her two adult children in a three-bedroom house for £695 per month in 2022. On 25 September that year, her landlord sent her a letter saying he was selling the property. He cited government decisions, interest rate increases, rising insurances and legislation he said unfairly tackled landlords. Two days earlier, then Prime Minister Liz Truss’s chancellor Kwasi Kwarteng shared a ‘mini budget’ intended to stimulate economic growth. This included £45bn of unfunded tax cuts - now mostly reversed. Following this, inflation and interest rates increased. A Liberal Democrat spokesperson blamed ""Liz Truss' botched budget"" for ""driving up rents for tenants"" and a Labour spokesperson said ""time and time again, the Tories have failed to stand up for renters"". A Conservative Party spokesman said “Covid and the war in Ukraine hiked up inflation and put pressure on renters, but we have got inflation down to normal levels”, adding they were committed to creating a fairer market for renters. Luisa spent four months looking for somewhere to live. “People were offering over the asking price or six months’ rent up front. I wasn’t in a position to do that,” she said. “It was like a bidding war – I’d turn up and there was a block viewing with about eight to 10 different people there.” Luisa rented the sixth house she viewed for £900 per month. She said: “I feel sorry for my children because my daughter’s 20 and at uni, my son is 26 – he has to help me out with rent. He’s unable to save up for his future.”

PA Media Surfers in Aberdeen stage a protest on the beach calling for an end to new oil and gas licensing

""Do you support new oil and gas licences, yes or no?"" That's the binary question which has been at the centre of the political debate in Scotland since parties began preparing to fight the general election. Political leaders have been hurling accusations that 100,000 jobs in Scotland will be at risk if no more licences are issued. But that figure is 40,000 more than the total number of people in Scotland whose roles currently rely directly or indirectly on fossil fuel extraction. And analysis by BBC Scotland News suggests that new licences will only extend the life of the North Sea by up to five years at today's production levels. The North Sea Transition Authority (NSTA) - which issues licences - estimates that about two billion barrels of ""unlicenced"" oil remains. Last year the industry produced 440 million barrels.

Environmentalists have been campaigning for governments to stop issuing exploration licences which allow oil companies to search for new discoveries of fossil fuels. The industry says without new oil finds, the rate at which the sector declines will accelerate - putting jobs at risk. It is now 25 years since production peaked in the North Sea. In 1999, the equivalent of about 1.7 billion barrels of oil and gas was pumped ashore. Output had dropped to 884 million barrels by 2010, then plummeted further to 552 million in 2022, a fall of about 67% on peak levels. Government predictions suggest output will halve again by 2030 to 251 million barrels and fall as low as 58 million by 2050 - which is just 3% of peak production. That's because when the oil boom came we targeted the biggest reserves first which were easiest to exploit.

Nowadays, operators are focused on the remaining smaller wells and using much more advanced - and expensive - techniques to extract it. While the North Sea Transition Authority estimates that the UK has around 10 to 15 billion barrels of oil and gas remaining, only about two billion are in areas where the UK government has so far not issued licences for operators to explore. The suggestion that 100,000 North Sea jobs could be at risk without new exploration licences came from Aberdeen and Grampian Chamber of Commerce. Using data from the investment banking firm Stifel, it produced a report last month saying the next Westminster government had ""just 100 days to save 100,000 jobs"" in the industry across the UK. During the general election campaign the Conservatives and SNP have repeatedly asserted that by promising to end exploration licences, their opponents risk 100,000 Scottish jobs.

Renewables industries like offshore wind are expected to ramp up this decade

The Conservatives fully support continued licences while the SNP say applications should be considered on a case-by-case basis. Labour has said it will issue no more licences and the Liberal Democrats believe the focus should be on creating more jobs in renewable energy like wind power. The Scottish Greens would go furthest of all, by rescinding recently issued licences including 54 which were granted in October and January. Offshore Energies UK estimates that there are now only 60,700 people in Scotland who work directly or indirectly in oil and gas. That number rises to 120,000 across the UK as a whole. Research by Robert Gordon University (RGU) estimates that in the worst case scenario the number of oil and gas jobs lost in the UK by 2030 could reach 60,000. It predicts that even on a best case scenario, with new licenses continuing and investment returning, some 33,000 jobs will still go as a result of falling oil and gas production. So by their estimate, the actual number of jobs ""at risk"" is 27,000 across the whole UK, not just Scotland.

Getty Images Amazon had to defend the use of AI technology in its physical grocery stores

Amazon received critical headlines this year when reports questioned the “Just Walk Out” technology installed at many of its physical grocery stores. The AI-powered system enables customers at many of its Amazon Fresh and Amazon Go shops to simply pick their items, and then leave. The AI uses lots of sensors to work out what you have chosen. You then get automatically billed. However, back in April it was widely reported that rather than solely using AI, Just Walk Out needed around 1,000 workers in India to manually check almost three quarters of the transactions.

Amazon was quick to claim that the reports were “erroneous”, and that staff in India were not reviewing video footage from all the shops. Instead it said that the Indian workers were simply reviewing the system. Amazon added that “this is no different than any other AI system that places a high value on accuracy, where human reviewers are common”. Whatever the exact details of the Amazon case, it is a high-profile example of a new and growing question – whether companies are making over-inflated claims about their use of AI. It is a phenomenon that has been dubbed “AI washing” in reference to the environmental ""green washing"".

But first, a reminder of what exactly AI means. While there is no exact definition, AI allows computers to learn and solve problems. AI is able to do this after first being trained on huge amounts of information. The specific type of AI that has made all the headlines over the past few years is so-called ""generative AI"". This is AI that specialises in creating new content, be it having text conversations, or producing music or images. Chatbots like ChatGPT, Google's Gemini, and Microsoft's Copilot are popular examples of generative AI. When it comes to AI washing, there are several types. Some companies claim to use AI when they're actually using less-sophisticated computing, while others overstate the efficacy of their AI over existing techniques, or suggest that their AI solutions are fully operational when they are not. Meanwhile, other firms are simply bolting an AI chatbot onto their existing non-AI operating software. While only 10% of tech start-ups mentioned using AI in their pitches in 2022, this rose to more than a quarter in 2023, according to OpenOcean, a UK and Finland-based investment fund for new tech firms. It expects that figure to be more than a third this year. And, says OpenOcean team member Sri Ayangar, competition for funding and the desire to appear on the cutting edge have pushed some such companies to overstate their AI capabilities. ""Some founders seem to believe that if they don’t mention AI in their pitch, this may put them at a disadvantage, regardless of the role it plays in their solution,"" says Mr Ayangar. ""And from our analysis, a significant disparity exists between companies claiming AI capabilities, and those demonstrating tangible AI-driven results.""

Sri Ayangar Sri Ayangar says that some start-up bosses feel they just have to mention AI

It is a problem that has quietly existed for a number of years, according to data from another tech investment firm, MMC Ventures. In a 2019 study it found that 40% of new tech firms that described themselves as ""AI start-ups"" in fact used virtually no AI at all. ""The problem is the same today, plus a different problem,"" says Simon Menashy, general partner at MMC Ventures. He explains that ""cutting-edge AI capabilities"" are now available for every company to buy for the price of standard software. But that instead of building a whole AI system, he says many firms are simply popping a chatbot interface on top of a non-AI product.

Douglas Dick, UK head of emerging technology risk at accountancy giant KPMG, says the problem of AI washing is not helped by the fact there not a single agreed definition of AI. ""If I asked a room of people what their definition of AI is, they would all give a different answer,” he says. “The term is used very broadly and loosely, without any clear point of reference. It is this ambiguity that is allowing AI washing to emerge. ""AI washing can have concerning impacts for businesses, from overpaying for technology and services to failing to meet operational objectives the AI was expected to help them achieve."" Meanwhile, for investors it can make it harder to identify genuinely innovative companies. And, says Mr Ayangar: ""If consumers have unmet expectations from products that claim to offer advanced AI-driven solutions, this can erode trust in start-ups that are doing genuinely ground-breaking work.""

Regulators, in the US at least, are starting to take notice. Earlier this year, the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) said it was charging two investment advisory firms with making false and misleading statements about the extent of their use of AI. ""The firm stance taken by the SEC demonstrates a lack of leeway when it comes to AI washing, indicating that, at least in the US, we can expect more fines and sanctions down the line for those who violate the regulations,"" says Nick White, partner at international law firm Charles Russell Speechlys.

Nick White Nick White says that it is good to see US regulators clamping down on the problem","What is 'AI washing' and why is it a problem?

Linköping University It might look basic - but could this be the future of screens?

At first glance, it looks like a relic from the 1980s. A tiny computer screen with flickering, low-resolution text scrolling across it. But this could be the future. The screen was made using perovskite light emitting diode (PeLED) technology. It is radically different to the LED technology used in your smartphone display today, and it could lead to devices that are thinner, cheaper and have longer battery life. Not only that, PeLEDs are very unusual in that they can absorb light as well as emit it, meaning you can use the same material to integrate touch, fingerprint and ambient light-sensing capabilities, says Feng Gao at Linköping University in Sweden. “This is difficult but we think it’s possible."" In today’s smartphones, such functions are carried out by electronic components separate to a phone’s screen itself. In a paper published in April, Prof Gao and colleagues demonstrated their prototype with touch and ambient light sensitivity already working. “It’s a very nice demonstration… it’s very new,” says Daniele Braga, head of sales and marketing for Fluxim, a technology research firm in Switzerland. Though he notes that optimising all the different functions promised here might make it difficult to commercialise this kind of display quickly. Via video call, Prof Gao shows off the latest version of the technology. It is another small screen, but this time the pixels per inch (ppi), a measurement of the sharpness of the display, has been nearly doubled – at 90 ppi. On the screen, a simple animation plays, showing two stick figures fighting. A paper with further details about this prototype has just been published.

Perovskite the mineral contains calcium, titanium and oxygen arranged in a crystal structure. It was discovered in the 1800s, but people later realised that they could make other kinds of perovskites that shared the same structure while having different elements or molecules as the components. Depending on the materials chosen, perovskites can be really good at, for example, conducting electricity or emitting light. “By slightly tuning the chemical composition you can cover the full visible spectrum,” says Dr Braga, explaining that making perovskites is a relatively simple and cheap process. “If you think about mass production, this is gigantic.” There are some problems, though. PeLEDs are notoriously unstable – they go bad with exposure to moisture or oxygen, for instance. Loreta Muscarella at VU Amsterdam, a university, is working to develop new kinds of PeLEDs. She says that if you leave a PeLED lying around for a few hours or days, the colour of light it emits will gradually degrade or shift to a less pure version of, say, green, than the green you want. And this undermines the whole point of perovskites. They are desirable in part because they can be tuned to emit a very specific, very pure form of red, green or blue – the key hues required for full colour digital displays.

To keep them stable, PeLEDs can be encapsulated in glue or resin, says Prof Gao. But researchers are still working on ensuring that the technology does not falter over a long period. Dr Muscarella says that traditional LEDs have lifetimes of 50,000 hours or more whereas PeLED lifespans are still in the hundreds to thousands of hours range. It could be years before you buy a commercial product that contains a PeLED, she adds. But there’s a different type of light-emitting perovskite that you might see on the market first. It relies on photoluminescence. This isn’t an LED as such but rather a filter or film-like material that absorbs and re-emits light in a particular colour. In some TV’s on the market today, a coloured filter supplies the crucial red, green and blue colours used in every pixel on the screen. It’s by mixing those colours at different levels that you can get the range of hues required to display a full picture. The red, green and blue filters are lit up by an LED backlight. But today’s filters actually block a lot of that light. Photoluminescent perovskites, in contrast, let almost all the light through, which would mean a big increase in brightness and efficiency. Helio, a British company, is working on this. A video on their website shows how a red or green coloured perovskite film can re-emit blue light as either red or green almost perfectly.

The technology Prof Gao and his colleagues are developing is quite different. They are experimenting with screens that emit light using LEDs which are themselves made with perovskites. These are known as electroluminescent perovskites. Working with them is tricky because they are sensitive to electrical fields and, as mentioned, aren’t very stable. But eventually they could be even more efficient options for lighting up the red, green and blue pixels in a smartphone, tablet or TV screen without any need for colour filters at all. The main advantages of switching to this technology could be in lowering the cost of these devices and in reducing their energy consumption. No-one is quite sure how much less energy a future PeLED display might consume versus, say, an OLED screen, but lab experiments suggest that PeLEDs are already competitive with OLEDs and could one day significantly exceed them in terms of efficiency, says Dr Muscarella.","The screen tech that can do almost anything7 days ago By Chris Baraniuk , Technology Reporter ShareLinköping University It might look basic - but could this be the future of screens?
