CNN —

Remember when Kate Moss wore wellies (that’s rain boots for those outside the UK) to Glastonbury?

As the historic festival once again returns to Worthy Farm, we look back at one of its most memorable fashion moments. After all, no British summer would be complete without copious amounts of mud.

And no one has conquered it quite like Moss.

Some 19 years ago, Britain’s best-known supermodel broke fashion’s proverbial fourth wall and joined the mortals in their muddy squalor. Sure, she’d probably spent the weekend glamping in the festival’s VIP zone. But a filthy field is England’s great leveler – and during those brief, well-photographed walks through the Glastonbury grounds, cigarette in hand, she was just like us.

Until, that is, her choice of practical footwear transformed festival fashion and helped save a heritage boot maker from the brink of obsolescence.

It was the summer of 2005 and Moss was near the height of her powers. Media interest in her festival whereabouts was amplified by a fixation with her then-nascent dalliance with Pete Doherty. But while The Libertines’ frontman certainly looked more at home in the conditions, it was Moss who grabbed the limelight.

Matching a pair of classic black Hunter rain boots with a waistcoat, short shorts and studded belt (and later a glittering tunic), the model was a picture of understated glamor. Below the knee her look was interchangeable with that of a Somerset pig farmer. But above it, she could just have easily emerged from a Chelsea mansion to a well-placed paparazzi ambush.

The images quickly went viral (or as viral as they could in the pre-social media age). The bastion of mid-1990s so-called “heroin chic” had become the face of its slightly older, more respectable cousin: mid-2000s festival chic.

In the process, wellies secured their place in the popular imagination. No longer the preserve of agriculture, they had become a rubbery status symbol best matched with trilby hats, cravats and other questionable noughties accessories. This once-practical boot had morphed into bourgeois badge of honor indicating that the wearer was prepared to “rough it” and still look fabulous (the drug-afflicted rockstar boyfriend remained an optional part of the look).

Suddenly, festival wear became its own category of clothing, something far greater than an amalgam of items you didn’t mind ruining. But an even more profound transformation was also taking place – that of the then-struggling Hunter Boot Limited.

The Scottish brand’s true heyday may have been during the World Wars, when it produced huge quantities of waterproof boots for the front lines. But never before in the company’s then 149-year history had its sensible footwear been so desirable. While one shouldn’t overstate the power of the Moss effect (her endorsement couldn’t save the boot maker from entering administration in 2006), it helped set in motion a remarkable turnaround in the company’s fortunes.

By 2007, the firm was under new ownership and reporting an 85% increase in year-on-year sales. It has since become a bona fide festival fixture, producing rainwear, outerwear and boots in all manner of colors and styles.

Once prized for keeping gangrene at bay in the trenches, Hunter has completed the ultimate 21st-century transformation to become the rainy-day boot de jour for celebrities from Rita Ora to Rihanna, Cara Delevingne to Alexa Chung.

And to think that all Kate wanted was a pair of snug, dry feet.","CNN —Remember when Kate Moss wore wellies (that’s rain boots for those outside the UK) to Glastonbury?

CNN —

The teenage cousin of the gunman responsible for the 2022 Uvalde, Texas, school shooting was arrested Monday on suspicion of threatening to “do the same thing” to a school, according to court documents obtained by CNN.

Nathan James Cruz, 17, was arrested on a felony charge of making a terroristic threat to a public place and a misdemeanor charge of making a terroristic threat against a family member, according to Bexar County Central Magistrate records.

Nathan James Cruz Bexar County Sheriff's Office

Cruz is the cousin of Salvador Ramos, the 18-year-old who fatally shot 19 children and two teachers at Robb Elementary School in May 2022, San Antonio police Sgt. Washington Moscoso told the New York Times on Monday.

CNN has sought comment from San Antonio police.

Ramos stormed into Robb Elementary last year armed with an assault rifle and tactical vest and opened fire on two adjoining classrooms – perpetrating one of the deadliest school shootings in modern US history. Law enforcement’s response has been heavily scrutinized, as officers waited outside the classrooms for more than an hour before entering and fatally shooting Ramos.

Cruz’s mother contacted police on Monday after her daughter reported that Cruz said he planned to “do the same thing” as his cousin, according to an affidavit obtained by CNN.

His mother told investigators she was “especially concerned because the suspect is currently on probation, was intoxicated at the time” and because the family lives across the street from an elementary school, the affidavit states.

Cruz’s sister told investigators that while she was giving her brother a ride, he “threatened to shoot her in the head and stated he would ‘shoot the school,’” according to the affidavit.

The mother allegedly overheard a phone conversation in which Cruz was attempting to illegally acquire an AR-15-style assault rifle – the same style used by Ramos to carry out the Uvalde shooting, according to the affidavit.

Following his arrest, Cruz “denied making any threats” when interviewed by a detective, the document states.

CNN has been unable to confirm whether Cruz has an attorney. His charges carry a combined $160,000 bond, according to the magistrate records.","Editor’s Note: (6/27/24) Since this story was published in August 2023, the case against Nathan James Cruz was dismissed due to a missing witness, according to court records in Bexar County, Texas.

U.S. prosecutors plan to seek a guilty plea from Boeing over a charge tied to two fatal crashes of 737 Max planes, attorneys for the victims' family members said Sunday, blasting a potential agreement as a ""sweetheart deal.""

Justice Department attorneys and victims' family members and their lawyers spoke for about two hours on Sunday, discussing the plan, lawyers said.

Boeing declined to comment, and it wasn't immediately clear if it would accept a plea deal. A guilty plea could complicate its ability to get government contracts. Boeing is a major defense contractor.

The Justice Department didn't immediately respond to a request for comment.

The DOJ said in May that it was reviewing whether Boeing violated a 2021 settlement that protected the company from federal charges tied to the 2018 and 2019 crashes of its best-selling 737 Max planes, which killed all 346 people on the two flights. Under that agreement, Boeing said it would pay $2.5 billion.

The DOJ revisited the agreement after a door panel blew out of a new 737 Max 9 midair during an Alaska Airlines flight in January, sparking a new safety and quality control crisis for one of the world's two suppliers of large commercial airplanes. The so-called deferred prosecution agreement was set to expire days before the door panel blew out.

Boeing admitted in 2021 that two of its pilots defrauded the Federal Aviation Administration by concealing its addition of a new flight-control system to the planes before they were flown commercially. That system was later implicated in the two crashes.

The plea deal would require Boeing to pay an additional fine of about $247 million and call for the installation of an outside monitor on Boeing, according to Paul Cassell, one of the lawyers. Cassell called the new deal a ""slap on the wrist.""","U.S. prosecutors plan to seek a guilty plea from Boeing over a charge tied to two fatal crashes of 737 Max planes, attorneys for the victims' family members said Sunday, blasting a potential agreement as a ""sweetheart deal.""

CNBC,https://www.cnbc.com/2024/07/01/boeing-to-buy-spirit-aerosystems.html,2024-07-01,04:46:09 UTC,Boeing agrees to buy fuselage maker Spirit AeroSystems in $4.7 billion deal,"Boeing said Monday that it will buy back its struggling fuselage maker Spirit AeroSystems in an all-stock deal that the planemaker has said will improve safety and quality control.

It said it agreed to pay $37.25 a share in Boeing stock for Spirit, giving the aerospace company an equity value of $4.7 billion. Including Spirit's debt the deal has a transaction value of $8.3 billion Boeing said. Spirit's shares closed Friday at $32.87 a share, giving it a market capitalization of about $3.8 billion.

Boeing in March disclosed that it was in talks to acquire the Wichita, Kansas-based company, weeks after a fuselage panel blew out midair from a nearly new Boeing 737 Max 9 on an Alaska Airlines flight, sparking a fresh crisis for Boeing. Spirit makes the fuselages for the 737 and other parts, including sections of Boeing's 787 Dreamliners.

In 2005, Boeing spun off operations in Kansas and Oklahoma that became the present-day Spirit AeroSystems. Boeing accounted for about 70% of Spirit's revenue last year, while roughly a quarter came from making parts for Boeing's main rival, Airbus, according to a securities filing.

CEO Dave Calhoun, who has said he will step down at the end of the year, on Monday said bringing Spirit in-house will ""fully align"" the companies' production systems and workforces.

""Among the many actions we're taking as a company, this is one of the most significant in demonstrating our unwavering commitment to strengthen quality and make certain that Boeing is the company the world needs it to be,"" Dave Calhoun said in a message to employees.

He said he expects the deal to close mid-2025, subject to approval by regulators, Spirit shareholders and the sale of Spirit's operators dedicated to Airbus planes.

Spirit's CEO Pat Shanahan is considered a possible replacement for Calhoun.

Airbus, meanwhile, said Monday it has reached an agreement with Spirit so that the European aircraft manufacturer is compensated $559 million by Spirit to acquire its manufacturing lines dedicated to Airbus planes. Those include operations in Belfast, Northern Ireland, where the wings and mid-fuselage of the A220 is produced, A220 pylons in Wichita, Kansas, and A350 fuselage sections in North Carolina.","Boeing said Monday that it will buy back its struggling fuselage maker Spirit AeroSystems in an all-stock deal that the planemaker has said will improve safety and quality control.

Disney and Pixar's ""Inside Out 2"" is the newest member of the billion-dollar club.

The animated feature has tallied $1.014 billion worldwide as of Sunday, making it the highest-grossing film of 2024 and the first film since Warner Bros.′ ""Barbie"" to top $1 billion at the global box office.

""On behalf of movie theatre owners across the country and around the world, we want to congratulate Disney's 'Inside Out 2' for grossing $1 billion faster than any animated movie in history,"" said Michael O'Leary, president and CEO of the National Association of Theatre Owners. ""The film's stunning global success once again illustrates that audiences the world over will respond to compelling, entertaining movies, and that they want to enjoy them on the big screen.""

The billion-dollar benchmark is a much-needed win for Disney's Pixar animation hub. A once prolifically successful studio, Pixar has suffered at the box office in the wake of the pandemic. Much of its difficulties have come, in part, because Disney opted to debut a handful of animated features directly on streaming service Disney+ during theatrical closures and even once cinemas had reopened.

As a result, before ""Inside Out 2,"" no Disney animated feature from Pixar or its Walt Disney Animation studio had generated more than $480 million at the global box office since 2019.

""Inside Out 2"" has also showcased how vital the family audience is to the box office. This underserved crowd accounted for more than 70% of those in attendance during the film's domestic debut, according to data from EntTelligence.

While this audience came out in droves for Universal's ""The Super Mario Bros. Movie,"" which generated more than $1.36 billion at the global box office, there was little for them to feast on until the recent releases of Sony's ""The Garfield Movie"" and Paramount's ""IF.""

""Inside Out 2"" also drove the coveted teen demographic to cinemas, with 14% of foot traffic coming from those aged 13 to 17. This younger generation has been largely absent from the market in recent years.

As the future of moviegoing, this group is particularly important to the industry. Getting them back to the big screen has become a top priority for studios and movie theater operators.

Next up for family and teens is Universal and Illumination's ""Despicable Me 4,"" due out in theaters during the July Fourth holiday weekend.

Two couples enjoying a drink at the races.

Millennials are poised to be the wealthiest generation in history, but are they ready to handle the large inflow of money?

A vast $90 trillion wealth transfer over the next 20 years will likely make millennials ""the richest generation in history,"" according to estimates from global real estate consultancy Knight Frank.

It found that the so-called silent generation — those typically born between 1928 to 1945 — and baby boomers — born from 1946 and 1964 — will ""hand over the reins"" to millennials — those born between 1981 and 1996 — when they pass on their assets.

Millennials have been portrayed as lazy and frivolous spenders, more keen to open their purse strings for avocado toasts instead of saving for a house — so just how equipped are they in managing the seismic flow of income?

""The millennials are very ill prepared … they're not as well prepared as the wealth creating generation,"" Salvatore Buscemi, co-founder and managing partner of multi-family office Brahmin Partners told CNBC.

By the time the millennials inherit this wealth, they will be in their 40s and may not have the aptitude for starting their own business or for investing, he elaborated.

""They don't have the skill sets earlier on to be able to do that because they never had to - they were never pushed,"" he said. ""And the problem is - are they going to be motivated later in life to push themselves to acquire these skill sets?"" asked Buscemi, adding that human nature suggests that people are less inclined to pick up new skills as they age.","Millennials are poised to be the wealthiest generation in history, but are they ready to handle the large inflow of money?

CNBC,https://www.cnbc.com/2024/06/30/democrats-defend-biden-debate-flop-voter-poll.html,2024-06-30,16:58:10 UTC,'Preparation overload': Democrats defend Biden after debate flop as voter support flinches,"Democrat candidate, U.S. President Joe Biden, and Republican candidate, former U.S. President Donald Trump, attend a presidential debate in Atlanta, Georgia, U.S., June 27, 2024.

Democrats are making the rounds on the Sunday media circuit working to reshape perceptions about President Joe Biden after he delivered a stumbling debate performance that left his voters cringing and his party in a damage-control frenzy.

""Yes, it was a bad performance,"" South Carolina's Democratic Rep. Jim Clyburn, a close Biden ally, said on CNN's ""State of the Union."" ""I know when I see what I call preparation overload. And that's exactly what was going on the other night.""

The South Carolina Democrat followed the post-debate spin formula that has emerged from Biden supporters since the Thursday showdown: Acknowledge the fumble and then pivot to critiques of the presumptive Republican presidential nominee, former President Donald Trump.

""Joe Biden should continue to run on his record. I do believe that we will find him when contrasted with the record of the four years of Trump to be exactly what we need going forward,"" Clyburn said.

Former presidents Barack Obama and Bill Clinton followed that structure in similar arguments on Friday.

House Democratic Leader Hakeem Jeffries, Sen. Chris Coons, D-Del., Sen. Raphael Warnock, D-Ga. and former House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., also jumped to Biden's defense on the Sunday media junket.

Despite the full-court press, Biden's Thursday debate performance, marked by several instances where he tripped over his words or trailed off mid-answer, has only amplified voter concerns about his age and fitness to carry out a second presidential term.

A new CBS News/YouGov poll taken between June 28 and June 29 found that 72% of registered voters surveyed do not think Biden should run for president, up from 63% in February. The poll also found that 72% of the respondents do not think that Biden has the mental and cognitive ability to serve as president, a seven percent increase since June 9.

A poll taken so shortly after a major event like Thursday's debate represents a knee-jerk reaction. A more accurate snapshot of public sentiment may emerge as the initial hype dies down and voters have more time to process. The CBS News poll surveyed 1,130 registered voters and had a margin of error of +/- 4.2%.

But those new numbers come in direct tension with Biden's argument that voters are not as down on his debate blunders as much as political pundits.

""I understand the concern about the debate. I get it. I didn't have a great night. But here's what [is] not getting reported: Voters had a different reaction than the pundits,"" the president said at a Saturday campaign event in East Hampton, N.Y. ""Since the debate, polls show a little movement, and we've moved us up, actually.""

Biden and Trump are scheduled for a second debate on Sept. 10, though it is unclear whether both candidates will follow through.

Ultimately, the debate has triggered a Democratic reckoning over whether Biden should remain the presumptive nominee.

Some Democratic strategists, along with newspaper editorial boards across the country have suggested he should step down and forfeit his delegates ahead of August's Democratic National Convention to allow someone else to take on Trump in November.

Biden is at Camp David on Sunday, joined by his family where he is expected to discuss the path forward of his reelection bid, according to NBC News.

In the meantime, the Biden campaign has been raking in large fundraising hauls in the wake of the debate. As of Sunday morning, the campaign had raised $33 million since Thursday, $26 million of which came from grassroots donors, according to Biden campaign spokesperson Kevin Munoz.

Munoz added that nearly half of that grassroots funding came from donors giving money to the campaign for the first time this election season.","Democrat candidate, U.S. President Joe Biden, and Republican candidate, former U.S. President Donald Trump, attend a presidential debate in Atlanta, Georgia, U.S., June 27, 2024.

The first round of a snap parliamentary election in France pointed to a surge in votes for the anti-immigrant National Rally party, with President Emmanuel Macron's centrist alliance coming into third place.

Early polling data from national broadcaster France 2 indicated that National Rally (RN) won 34% of the vote while the leftist New Popular Front (NFP) alliance got 28.1%. Macron's centrist Together bloc garnered 20.3%, according to initial projections.

On Monday morning, France's Interior Ministry said RN and its allies had won 33.1% of the vote, the NFP was in second with 28% and Macron's coalition had reached 20%, the ministry said.

The second round of voting on July 7 is the one to watch, according to Antonio Barroso, deputy director of Research at Teneo.

""First-round victories tend to say little about the overall results (absent a surprisingly high number of wins obtained by a specific party). This is why, beyond the overall percentage of votes for each party, the main issue to watch on Sunday night is how many candidates from each party will make it to the second round,"" he said in a note Wednesday.

""If, as expected, Together does poorly in the first round, there will be numerous races between the NFP and the RN.""

Ahead of the first ballot, French voter polls suggested the hard-right National Rally party would win around 35% of the vote in the election, followed by the leftist NFP alliance and then a coalition of pro- Macron parties in third place.

As such, National Rally is widely expected to significantly increase the number of seats it has in France's 577-seat parliament, the National Assembly, from the current level of 89.","The first round of a snap parliamentary election in France pointed to a surge in votes for the anti-immigrant National Rally party, with President Emmanuel Macron's centrist alliance coming into third place.

But the one thing they all have in common is that they're irrational, according to one phobia specialist.

""A phobia is an irrational response to a benign substance,"" Christopher Paul Jones, a London-based phobia specialist with a clinic on London's Harley Street, told CNBC Make It in an interview.

""As human beings, we are primitively hardwired that when we experience danger, our amygdala fires off, and then we do one of several things. Most commonly fight, flight, or freeze. So, either get angry and punch the thing, or we run from the thing, or we hide from the thing,"" he said. The amygdala is a part of the brain that processes emotions like fear or motivation.

This trigger is handy when we were fighting saber-toothed tigers or if we were in actual danger, Jones said. However, a phobia is when that response is to something that isn't dangerous.

Jones' clinic has treated a variety of phobias from a fear of water, heights, germs, needles, and even the fear of failure.

He explained that phobias develop through a conditioned response like that of Pavlov's dogs experiment. That famous experiment was carried out by Russian neurologist Ivan Pavlov who would ring a bell every time he fed his dogs. The dogs eventually started to salivate when they heard the bell ring because they associated it with food.

""Human beings do the same thing,"" Jones explained. ""Most commonly with a phobia, at some point in your past, your brain has linked danger to something that has happened ... then whenever you think about that thing again in the future, it fires off that old response.""

Jones' recently published book ""Face Your Fears"" guides readers through exercises to help them overcome their fears. He shared his three top tips to overcome any fear with CNBC Make It.","Phobias come in many forms: Some people fear spiders while others fear flying on a plane.

The largest utility companies in the U.S. are warning that the nation is facing a surge of electricity demand unlike anything seen in decades, and failure to rapidly increase power generation could jeopardize the nation's economy. After a more than decade-long period of largely flat growth, electricity demand is poised to skyrocket by 2030 as the artificial intelligence revolution, the expansion of chip manufacturing, and the electrification of the vehicle fleet all coincide as the U.S. is trying to address climate change. The tech sector's build out of data centers to support AI and the adoption of electric vehicles alone is expected to add 290 terawatt hours of electricity demand by the end of the decade, according to a report released by the consulting firm Rystad Energy this week. The expected demand from data centers and electric vehicles in the U.S. is equivalent to the entire electricity demand of Turkey, the world's 18th largest economy, according to Rystad. ""This growth is a race against time to expand power generation without overwhelming electricity systems to the point of stress,"" said Surya Hendry, a Rystad analyst, in a release following the report's publication.

'The stakes are really, really high'

The major tech players – Amazon , Alphabet's Google unit, Microsoft and Meta – are urgently requesting more power as they bring data centers online that in some cases require a gigawatt of electricity, said Petter Skantze, vice president of infrastructure development at NextEra Energy Resources. To put that in context, a gigawatt is equivalent to the capacity of nuclear reactor. NextEra Energy , parent of Skantze's subsidiary, is the largest power company in the S&P utilities sector by market capitalization and it operates the biggest portfolio of renewable energy assets in the nation. ""This is a different urgency coming. They need this load to drive the next iteration of growth,"" Skantze told the Reuters Global Energy Transition conference in New York City this week. ""They're showing up now at the utility and they're banging on the door and they're saying I need to put this resource on the grid,"" the executive said.

A big challenge will be whether enough resources are available to connect those large data center projects to the power grid, Skantze said. The stakes are high for the U.S. economy, the executive said. ""If I can't get that power capacity online, I cannot do the data center. I cannot do the manufacturing. I can't grow the core businesses of some of the largest corporations in the country,"" Skantze said. ""The stakes are really, really high. This is a new environment. We have to get this right."" NextEra CEO John Ketchum told investors earlier this month that U.S. power demand will increase by 38% over the next two decades, a fourfold increase over the annual rate of growth in the previous 20 years. NextEra expects much of the demand to be met by renewables and battery storage, Ketchum said. The company has a 300-gigawatt pipeline of renewable and storage projects.

'Energy security brings national security'

Southern Company , the second-largest utility in the U.S. by market cap, is also seeing a historic wave of electricity demand. The power company is headquartered in Atlanta, one of the fastest growing data center markets in the U.S. with 723 gigawatts under construction in 2023, up 211% over the prior year, according to real estate services firm CBRE. Southern Company CEO Chris Womack said the company is seeing a level of demand not seen since the advent of air conditioning and heat pumps in the South in the 1970s and 1980s. The utility is expecting demand to grow by three or four times, he said. ""A lot of this is dependent and contingent upon what we see with artificial intelligence and all those large learning models and what data centers will consume,"" Womack said. ""You're also seeing in the Southeast, this incredible population growth and you're seeing all this onshoring with manufacturing."" Supplying the demand with reliable power is a matter of economic and national security, Womack said. Southern expects 80% of the demand through the end of the decade to be met by renewables, he said.","The expected demand from data centers and electric vehicles in the U.S. is equivalent to the entire electricity demand of Turkey, the world's 18th largest economy, according to Rystad.

Nearly two in three workers around the world are ""vacation deprived,"" according to a new report published by Expedia. However, the report shows the feeling is highest among cultures that take the most days off. Some 84% of Germans and 69% of French respondents said they feel they don't have enough time off, according to Expedia's ""Vacation Deprivation Report"" published on June 20. That's despite respondents from both countries taking the most vacation days — 27 days and 29 days, respectively — in the survey. The survey of more than 11,500 workers showed Americans take the least time off per year (11 days), followed by Japan (12 days). However, only 53% of Japanese said they feel ""vacation deprived"" compared to 65% of Americans, it showed.

The survey — Expedia's 24th annual report on the topic — shows that while vacation deprivation rates have decreased in many parts of the world, the feeling is at an 11-year high in the United States.

What's happening in France and Germany?

Expedia's report indicates that feeling ""vacation deprived"" has less to do with the actual time off one takes, and more to do with cultural mores around work and free time. ""The French overwhelmingly view time off as a basic, fundamental right, while Americans seem to treat is as a guilty pleasure,"" said Christie Hudson, head of public relations for Expedia in the United States. ""This is why not even a month seems like enough time to the average French worker.""

Among Germans, however, only 42% said they feel their employers are supportive of them taking their vacation time, the lowest rate across all markets, said Hudson. ""This can contribute to guilt and being unable to unplug and feel refreshed after vacation,"" she said, adding that ""vacation deprivation"" can result from feeling unable to use the days off you are given, she said.

Wasted vacation days

Despite most workers indicating they feel vacation deprived, respondents from nearly every location admitted to letting some of their annual leave lapse.

Hong Kongers, however, meticulously planned their leave, not allowing a single day to go unused, on average, the report showed. Interestingly, Hong Kong was the only location where workers said they planned to take more time off than they're given, said Hudson. ""In 2024, 15% of Hong Kongers plan on taking 31 vacation days, exceeding the average allotted 25.5 days,"" said Hudson. ""It's an interesting finding and could be linked to the fact that they seem to have a strong pro-PTO culture: 80% of Hong Kong workers agree that their employers are supportive of employees taking their vacation time, which is one of the highest rates globally."" That could mean that ""those few extra days here and there are overlooked,"" she said. Singaporeans, too, carefully plan their time off, allowing only one of their 20 days of annual leave to lapse, according to the report. But those in Japan aren't nearly as focused on maximizing their days off, it showed. Respondents there left seven out of 19 days on the table, on average.

Optimism in artificial intelligence drove up Taiwan's stock market in the first of the 2024, making it the top performing market in Asia-Pacific so far this year. The Taiwan Weighted Index has surged 28% so far this year, powered by stocks along the AI value chain. Heavyweight Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Corp climbed 63% in the first half of the year, while its rival Foxconn — traded as Hon Hai Precision Industry — jumped 105% in the same period. ""The performance of global markets this year has been largely driven by the themes of Artificial Intelligence and central bank policy, and that is likely to continue,"" said Rahul Ghosh, global equity portfolio specialist at asset management company T. Rowe Price said in the firm's investment outlook. The potential and scale of the AI investment cycle continues to drive economic activity globally, he said, adding that the impact of AI investments are broadening out to sectors such as industrials, materials and utilities.

Japan's benchmark index Nikkei 225 ranked second in the region, after repeatedly surpassing all-time highs earlier this year. In the first six months of the year, the Nikkei has gained about 18%. The Nikkei smashed past a 34-year record in February, breaching its previous all-time high of 38,915.87, set on Dec. 29, 1989. Following that, the index surged past the psychological threshold of 40,000, and eventually reached a new all-time closing high of 40,888.43 on March 22. While Taiwan may lead Asian markets, Japan seems to be the favored market going forward, among analysts who spoke to CNBC.

Ghosh said that improved corporate governance standards continue to have a tangible — and considerable — impact on company performance in the world's fourth largest economy. Furthermore, a June 14 note from Ben Powell, chief APAC investment strategist at the BlackRock Investment Institute, pointed out that the Bank of Japan has increasing confidence it will meet its inflation targets, and as such, normalize its monetary policy ""in a gradual and measured way."" Powell said Japan's macroeconomic backdrop is favorable for risk assets. ""We remain overweight Japanese equities, driven by strong corporate reform momentum, healthy earnings and the valuation support from still-negative real interest rates."" While most Asian markets are in positive territory year-to-date, three stock markets — Thailand, Indonesia and the Philippines — fell into negative territory. Thailand's SET Index plunged 8% in the first six months, to be the worst performing index in the region. The Jakarta Composite was down by 2.88% while the Philippine stock exchange index slipped about 0.6% in the same period.

All eyes on the Fed

Most central banks in Asia are keeping a close eye on the Federal Reserve's next move, as they typically make monetary policy decisions based on the U.S. central bank's anticipated moves. The Fed signaled toward the end of 2023 that several rate cuts were on the cards this year. However, the most recent ""dot plot"" from the Fed's May meeting projected only one cut of 25 basis points for the remainder of 2024.This was a huge departure from the graph released at the end of March, where the Fed implied that rates will be cut by 75 basis points in 2024. The dot plot is a visual representation of each FOMC member's interest rate projection for the bank's short-term interest rate at specific points in the future. The central bank, however, has penciled in a more aggressive path to tightening monetary policy in 2025, increasing its forecast to four cuts of 25 basis points each.

Rate cut expectations have been pushed back repeatedly as inflation remained stickier than expected. Higher employment and wage growth in the U.S. also added to the narrative that there was no need for the Fed to lower rates. The question now is: When will the first rate cut happen? The CME FedWatch tool indicates that 61% of traders expect the Fed to cut rates by 25 basis points in the September meeting. But on June 16, Minneapolis Federal Reserve President Neel Kashkari said it's a ""reasonable prediction"" that the U.S. central bank will cut interest rates once this year, but will wait until December to do it. Kashkari's view was echoed by Ken Orchard, head of international fixed income at asset management firm T. Rowe Price. ""We still see the Fed cutting 25 basis points at its December policy meeting, after the November elections are out of the way, and possibly once in the summer.""

CNBC,https://www.cnbc.com/2024/06/28/amazon-doubling-value-of-credits-for-startups-to-build-on-aws-cloud.html,2024-06-30,00:56:26 UTC,Amazon is doubling value of credits for some startups to build on AWS as Microsoft cloud gains ground,"Attendees walk through an expo hall at AWS re:Invent, a conference hosted by Amazon Web Services, at the Venetian in Las Vegas on Nov. 28, 2023.

Amazon will double the value of credits it offers some startups to use its cloud infrastructure, CNBC has learned, as the company faces heightened competition from Microsoft in artificial intelligence services.

Starting July 1, startups that have raised a Series A round of funding in the past year will be eligible for $200,000 in credits through AWS' Activate program, up from $100,000 before, the Amazon cloud unit said in an email to venture capitalists this week. Seed-stage startups will still be eligible for $100,000 in credits, AWS said.

Two people briefed on the changes confirmed the credit increase, though they asked not to be named because the information is private.

Matt Garman, who was recently promoted to CEO of AWS after running sales and marketing, was meeting with founders in Silicon Valley this week, the people said. Garman told the execs that collaborating with startups would always be a primary focus, one of the people said, adding that Garman described AI companies as AWS' ideal customers.

AWS confirmed the increase in credits and Garman's visit to Silicon Valley, and said that in the past, the $100,000 would expire in one year, while the $200,000 credit will now expire in three years. A company spokesperson called AWS the leader in cloud ""by a wide margin,"" adding that over 280,000 startups run on AWS, including 96% of ""unicorns"" in AI and machine learning.

""These new programs are simply us doubling down on this incredible momentum,"" the spokesperson said.

Amazon, which is best known for its massive online retail operation, derives most of its profit from AWS, a business it launched in 2006, well before rivals Microsoft and Google hit the scene. AWS leads the market, with $25 billion in revenue in the first quarter, up 17% from a year earlier.

But Microsoft Azure and Google Cloud are growing more quickly, and are benefiting from rapidly advancing AI models. Backed by Microsoft, OpenAI launched ChatGPT in late 2022 on Azure, and has since attracted a wave of AI workloads to Microsoft from companies big and small. Google has a number of large language models, most notably Gemini.

Amazon has been trying to catch up in generative AI and has poured billions of dollars into OpenAI challenger Anthropic.

Last month, AWS CEO Adam Selipsky announced his resignation after three years running the business, with Garman named as his successor. During Selipsky's time at the helm, Microsoft and Google increased their share of the cloud infrastructure market. One analyst told CNBC that Microsoft ""ran laps around"" AWS in generative AI.

Startups have long been fertile ground for cloud infrastructure companies, as they try and lure ambitious founders who could be building the next multibillion-dollar business.

In November, Microsoft announced a partnership with Silicon Valley accelerator Y Combinator that would provide participating startups with $350,000 in Azure credits and access to graphics processing units (GPUs) for training AI models, a spokesperson said. Microsoft has since extended the $350,000 credit incentive to other accelerators, including the AI Grant.

Startups enrolled in Microsoft's Founders Hub program, which doesn't require previous venture funding, can receive up to $150,000 in Azure credits over four years.

In addition to its Activate offering, Amazon has a new 10-week generative AI accelerator program. Participants will be able to access up to $1 million in cloud credits, according to the website.

Earlier on Friday, Amazon's head scientist, Rohit Prasad, told employees that the company has hired David Luan, co-founder and CEO of AI startup Adept, along with some of Luan's colleagues. ""Amazon is also licensing Adept's agent technology, family of state-of-the-art multimodal models, and a few datasets,"" Adept said in a blog post.

AWS remains the leader in cloud infrastructure, but Microsoft is quickly closing the gap. AWS' market share slipped to 31% in the first quarter of this year from 32% three years earlier, while Azure jumped to 25% of the market from 19% in 2021, according to Canalys. Google is also picking up share, accounting for 10% of the market, up from 7% in early 2021.

Air traffic, extreme weather The Federal Aviation Administration has found a shortage of up to 3,000 needed air traffic controllers. Last summer, a record-breaking summer for airports, there were air traffic jams and near collisions amid challenges in flight coordination. Based on air traffic patterns and airport density, New York City and Florida are subject to the highest risk of backups. The massive heat wave across the U.S. was a peek at the kind of extreme weather that can lead to travel issues. The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration expects disruptive weather for the holiday week, with storms across the Midwest and East Coast, and continuing dangerous heat in the Southwest and interior Northeast. Extreme temperatures cause technical failures that result in delays. High heat creates thin air, which hampers the plane's thrust for takeoff and ascent. That means airplanes need more runway for takeoff or a lighter aircraft — by removing baggage or passengers. And it means that very high temperatures increase the risk of flight cancellations. The best bet to avoid this risk is to take early morning and late-night flights. Good news to reduce travel anxiety If travelers prepare and secure backup plans, they can make the best out of the busy summer season. And despite travel anxiety and a cascade of uncertain factors, travel expert and managing editor at The Points Guy, Clint Henderson, says airlines and airports are so far showing signs of being better prepared than past years. Despite May issues and despite some airlines pulling back on overall hiring plans compared to past years, in part due to Boeing delays, Henderson said, ""We have not seen the major meltdowns that we saw a couple of years ago. And I think part of the reason for that is the airlines and the airports, and everyone from Uber to rental car companies, you know, you name it, everyone staffed back up.""

United Airlines has projected a 7% increase in flyers from the 2023 Independence Day week, and is adapting with new staff. American Airlines is slated for 10% more summer departures year over year. Improvements in coordination for air traffic controllers are also taking place. ""The federal government and local ATC towers have been working together better, and that includes the military. They've opened up military airspace to help accommodate the crowd, so we have seen snarls,"" Henderson said. ""There is still a shortage of air traffic controllers, but it hasn't led to the worst outcomes that we were expecting when we were talking about the shortage of air traffic control workers even a year ago."" That said, he warns that in severe weather, a shortage of air traffic control may still worsen delays for travelers. Tips for Independence Day travel With lower-than-expected prices, many more flyers this summer are infrequent flyers, who should start by signing up for airline apps which may offer them some introductory benefits, starting with miles and extending to free WiFi on some flights. Henderson said the easiest ways to save hours of wait times include signing up for programs that offer passengers faster movement through security, including TSA PreCheck and Clear, as well as the no-application-required Mobile Passport Control app, which allows users to go through an expedited U.S. Customs lane. He also recommended the ""Flighty"" tracker app, or similar flight tracker, to stay on top of options in the event flight status changes. Flyers need to also stay on top of the routes that the planes they plan to take are already traveling on, to catch issues at other airports which could ultimately cause a cascade of cancellations. ""If your flight gets canceled, you're competing with all those people on that plane to get on the next available flight. So if you have a head start on those people, you're going to be the winner,"" Henderson said. When it comes to traveling during peak season, ""Information is power,"" he said. Cheaper airfares may not be here to stay Airfares are down, but many factors influence price, from the specific destination of a traveler, with wide variation in prices depending on route, to how far in advance tickets are purchased, midweek travel versus weekend dates, and what additional fees (e.g. baggage) may push up the total cost of travel significantly. In addition, with issues lingering in the supply of new planes, from Boeing production being curtailed by the FAA to Airbus running into supply chain snafus, the recent dip in fares may not last too long. Henderson eventually expects price hikes from airlines related to increasing maintenance costs and reduced fleet capacity. Labor costs and fuel costs per flight skyrocketed in the past year. With production delays, airlines pay billions to fly less fuel-efficient and more costly and aged jets. Technical issues are more common on older plans and increase delays as well. On June 26, Southwest Airlines cut its second-quarter revenue forecast while citing booking concerns. The firm announced a decline in expected revenue per seat per mile, and fuel costs increasing up to 7.5% year over year. But for now, even with rising costs, flight prices have yet to return to their summer 2023 peaks, and consumers are taking advantage. Henderson said many last-minute travel deals that airlines are offering this summer are still available. Even if the security lines are long, prices on many routes should not weigh travelers down. Hopefully, neither will delays and cancellations.","Last summer, a record-breaking summer for airports, there were air traffic jams and near collisions amid challenges in flight coordination.

CNBC,https://www.cnbc.com/2024/06/30/here-are-our-top-3-and-bottom-3-stocks-during-a-divergent-second-quarter.html,2024-06-30,15:18:01 UTC,Here are our top 3 and bottom 3 stocks during a divergent second quarter,"It was another largely great quarter for the stock market — completing a strong first half of the year for the Dow Jones Industrial Average , the S & P 500 and the Nasdaq , all trading around record highs. The Nasdaq was the big winner of the second quarter, adding 8.26% over the past three months thanks to an artificial intelligence-powered tech rally. The S & P 500 gained 3.92% since the end of March. The Dow, on the other hand, closed out the April through June period in the loss column — ending down 1.73%. The Dow is not as heavily weighted in tech, which was the top-performing sector in Q2. Here's a look at the three best second-quarter performers among the 33 stocks in the CNBC Investing Club portfolio and the three worst. Best Performers NVDA YTD mountain Nvidia YTD Nvidia continued to be the top-performing stock in the portfolio for the second quarter in a row, gaining 36.73%. The major contributor to the upside was a blowout fiscal 2025 first quarter accompanied by strong current quarter guidance. During the post-earnings call in May, the risk of a so-called air pocket in sales momentum as the company transitions to its new Blackwell chip architecture was taken off the table . Management said demand for the yet-to-be-released platform already outstrips supply. Last week, if only briefly, Nvidia became the most valuable U.S. company. After record high after record high, the stock pulled back recently. On Wednesday, at Nvidia's annual shareholders meeting, founder and CEO Jensen Huang took questions and laid out the company's overall strategy to maintain its lead position in enabling AI. AAPL YTD mountain Apple YTD The second big winner was Apple , which rose 22.82% in Q2. The stock didn't do much in the first month of the second quarter. However, all that changed in early May when the company reported solid earnings . Services revenue was better than expected and China was nowhere near as bad as feared. That got the stock going. But the real break out to all-time highs followed the company's AI announcements at this month's Worldwide Developers Conference. Shares took that other leg up, in our view, because Apple Intelligence will only be available on last year's iPhone 15 Pro models or better. That means the vast majority of iPhone users, who we know to be extremely loyal to the brand, have a better reason than ever before to upgrade their devices. We expect many to do so. AVGO YTD mountain Broadcom YTD Broadcom came in third and saw its stock advance 21.13% in April through June. After consolidating for much of the quarter, the stock started jumping earlier this month on strong quarterly results and management raising their outlook for AI-related revenue generation. Investors also came away with increased confidence that the legacy aspects of the business were bottoming and set to rebound into the back half of the year. That confidence also makes sense when considering that Broadcom is a key Apple supplier. So any outsized AI-upgrade cycle that Apple sees is going to translate into a strong cycle for suppliers like Broadcom as well. Worst Performers EL YTD mountain Estee Lauder YTD Estee Lauder was the worst name of the second quarter for the Club portfolio, losing 30.98%. The stock was largely rangebound in April, however, the negative momentum took hold once again when shares got punished for its light guidance. Management's disappointing outlook sparked fresh concerns over the pace of the recovery in Asia Travel Retail. While the report was largely positive and we did see signs of an inflection playing out, these concerns on the pace and magnitude of the recovery continue to weigh on shares. DIS YTD mountain Disney YTD The second worst performer was Disney , which dropped 18.85% in April through June. Disney started to drift back down after management won its proxy fight to keep activist investor Nelson Peltz off the company board. Peltz, who had a big stake in Disney, exited the position. The stock then took another hit on lackluster earnings , in which the company missed expectations on the top line. While noting that Disney's combined direct-to-consumer (DTC) business is still on the path to profitability by the end of fiscal year 2024 in September, the current quarter would see pressure resulting seasonal weakness attributable to its streaming offering in India, known as Disney+ Hotstar. SWK YTD mountain Stanley Black & Decker YTD The third worst performer of the quarter was Stanley Black & Decker , with an 18.42% decline. While shares recovered post-earnings losses quickly, they subsequently reversed back down and now sit below where the level reached in the selloff after the quarterly numbers were release in early May. At least some of that pressure was likely caused by a rebound in longer-term bond yields, which kept borrowing costs high. We view Stanley Black & Decker as our play on Federal Reserve interest rate cuts, which when they happen, should lower mortgages and boost the housing market.

CNBC,https://www.cnbc.com/2024/06/28/apples-vision-pro-starts-deliveries-at-a-higher-price-in-china-than-in-the-us.html,2024-06-28,15:25:25 UTC,Apple's Vision Pro starts deliveries at a higher price in China than in the U.S.,"The Apple Vision Pro mixed-reality headset is on sale at the Apple flagship store in Hangzhou, Zhejiang Province of China, on June 28, 2024.

HANGZHOU, China — Apple 's mixed-reality headset began deliveries in China on Friday with a retail price roughly 18% higher than in the U.S.

The device starts at 29,999 yuan, or $4,128, in China, compared to a $3,500 retail price in the U.S.

When asked by CNBC, a customer surnamed Chen in Beijing said his suggestion to Apple CEO Tim Cook was to make Vision Pro cheaper by about 10,000 yuan, or $1,376. The customer, who did not share his first name due to concerns about speaking with foreign media, said many people in China might prefer to buy a secondhand Vision Pro because of the discounted price that typically comes with purchases from sellers unaffiliated with Apple.

Many of the most popular posts about the device on Chinese social media platform Weibo on Friday focused on the hashtag ""is it worth paying for the China version of Vision Pro,"" according to a CNBC translation.

CNBC has reached out to Apple for comment.

Greater China accounted for about 18% of Apple's revenue in the three months that ended March 30, according to an Apple filing.

Over the past year, Apple has faced growing competition from Huawei devices and other domestic brands, amid greater attention on national security.

Chen preordered his Vision Pro and was at a major store in Beijing to pick it up and receive some training on how to use it.

Store salespeople told CNBC that all of Friday's half-hour training sessions for preorders of the Vision Pro were booked up at Apple stores in Beijing — from 8 a.m. to 10 p.m.

Chinese companies such as Tencent, Alibaba and JD.com have launched Vision Pro versions of their apps for shopping, playing games and watching videos.","The Apple Vision Pro mixed-reality headset is on sale at the Apple flagship store in Hangzhou, Zhejiang Province of China, on June 28, 2024.

CNBC,https://www.cnbc.com/2024/06/29/bandit-running-unsponsored-project-decks-out-olympic-hopefuls.html,2024-06-29,12:00:01 UTC,"Why so many Olympic hopefuls are running in all-black, unbranded gear","Christopher Royster, left, and JT Smith, athletes who participate in Bandit Running's Unsponsored Project, at the 2024 Olympic trials in Eugene, Oregon.

There's an army of unsponsored athletes commanding attention at the U.S. Track & Field Olympic Trials this year, decked out in all-black, logo-less gear.

The 35 athletes are supported by apparel company Bandit Running's Unsponsored Project, an effort to challenge the standard sponsorship model for professional athletes and boost up-and-coming competitors.

Unsponsored athletes in track and field would typically purchase their own apparel bearing the emblems of major brands, effectively providing free advertising for the companies. Instead, Bandit Running offers Olympic hopefuls the all-black kits and warmups — along with short-term endorsement deals.

Bandit co-founder Tim West said the company is giving out at least 35 two-week deals for unsponsored runners at the trials, a U.S. Olympian's gateway into the four-year games. The deals consist of unbranded apparel, a platform and cash to cover expenses. Last year, Bandit partnered with nine athletes.

""We're really hoping for a new sponsorship model where brands take a healthy piece of their budget and apply it to the kind of amateur, sub-elite athlete to help grow the sport. I think when you lift up, sort of the bottom, everything pushes up,"" West told CNBC.

Bandit's deals have a built-in release clause, West said, allowing an easy out for athletes who get a traditional sponsorship offer during the trials.

Given the high prices associated with competing, West said unsponsored athletes are ""investing in themselves,"" posing an opportunity for brands to step in and help out.

And, the all-black, logo-free kits help call attention to which athletes may be available to strike a longer-term deal.

Among them is Courtney Okolo, a 400-meter runner.

After winning a gold medal in the 2016 Rio Olympics and being sponsored by Nike for four years, Okolo, 30, is embracing the Unsponsored Project. She said getting support while competing without a sponsorship is difficult, but Bandit's initiative makes it feel like she isn't doing it all on her own.","Christopher Royster, left, and JT Smith, athletes who participate in Bandit Running's Unsponsored Project, at the 2024 Olympic trials in Eugene, Oregon.

CNBC,https://www.cnbc.com/2024/06/30/move-over-remote-ceos-say-borderless-talent-future-tech-jobs.html,2024-06-30,15:41:36 UTC,"Move over, remote jobs. CEOs say borderless talent is the future of tech work","To work remotely or not is no longer the question. Experts say it's borderless hiring for technology roles that is stealing the conversation.

""Remote is like the gateway drug to borderless,"" said Jeremy Johnson, CEO of AI-enabled tech talent marketplace Andela, whose customers include Goldman Sachs, Github and Coursera. ""Once you realize that you don't have to all be in the same office five days a week in order to build a compelling culture and feel connected to the mission and solve complex problems, you then start thinking there are great people all over the world.""

With tech leaders focusing concurrently on innovation and value-driven efficiency, tech hiring that eclipses national or even global time zone delineation is a growing phenomenon. Borderless tech hiring has doubled in the last three years, according to Gartner's 2023 CEO Survey. By 2022, the tech talent workforce in cities like Beijing and Delhi far outweighed that of U.S. powerhouses like San Francisco and New York, reports CBRE Global Tech Talent Guidebook 2024. The report cites burgeoning tech talent markets like Bucharest, Romania; Cape Town, South Africa; Cebu City, Philippines; Nairobi, Kenya and more.

Global hiring is an example of a luxury that's moving down the value chain, Johnson said. Much like services such as Uber increased access to what is essentially a private driver on demand, talent marketplaces and a digitized workforce make global hiring more than just a pricey C-suite search.

Global payment processing platform Payoneer has its hands in the borderless hiring world from an internal perspective (with about 2,200 employees in 50 countries and more than 25 offices globally), but it also benefits from and drives the borderless trend with its clients.

""The rhetoric about the globalized opportunity is powerful, but it doesn't make any difference to the business you're doing unless you actually have the utilities and tools to do it,"" said Payoneer CEO John Caplan.

Pockets of talent worldwide

Adam Jackson, CEO of decentralized tech talent platform Braintrust, does borderless differently. ""We don't have a physical office,"" he said. ""Everyone works remotely. Every engineer but one who works on Braintrust is outside of the U.S."" Braintrust's clients, from NASA to Nestlé, are building borderless teams, too, Jackson says.

""It was the case maybe 20 years ago when I moved to San Francisco that the best tech, best developers, best product managers and designers all lived here in Silicon Valley,"" Jackson added. ""That's just not true anymore. There are still many here, but there are pockets all over the world.""

Some leaders, like Johnson, believe time zone coordination is still important to provide certain employees with the opportunity to work synchronously. Jackson, however, has the viewpoint that global innovation with an asynchronous workforce is a chance to create a company ""where the sun never sets.""

While there are questions about work-life balance, Jackson says that doesn't exist in startup culture anyway, but that asynchronous work can increase clarity in documentation and minimize the endless treadmill of meetings, leaving more time for creative thinking and deep work.

Johnson says local labor laws, compliance and payroll are all factors at play in global operations, which is why many organizations have opened centers in specific countries. But even these obstacles aren't insurmountable.

AI and future of work geographies

One thing these experts agree on is that there's no one-size-fits-all approach to borderless hiring. ""Every company has to find their own bespoke solution,"" Caplan said. ""You have to design your office footprint, your future-of-work philosophy to the business you're building.""

Thinking about artificial intelligence innovation and, on the flip side of the same coin, AI regulation, Johnson says the European Union's standard-setting regulatory framework will make it tough for tech operations to thrive. As more regulatory and case law settles around the globe surrounding AI and data, cross-border employment trends will shift like puzzle pieces.

""I think Europe is going to have a really tough time over the next few years,"" he said. ""They're pushing a lot of data innovation out of the continent, and I think that's an opportunity for Africa and Latin America and other parts of the world.""

Regardless of where organizations hire, Jackson emphasizes the importance of managing risk and hiring good people. ""Quality still matters,"" he said. ""The old adage is when you're building software, do you want to be fast, good quality, or cheap? Pick two. Now, I reject that. You can have all three, but quality still matters, no matter where you are.""

Caplan relishes in the more altruistic potential of borderless employment, namely its ability to ""lift up communities around the globe."" This may be true, but at the very least, its benefits for expanded talent reach and cost effectiveness are enough for leaders in all kinds of industries to take it on. With applications for standard work-sponsored visas in the U.S. up 263% in 2023 compared to the year prior, according to Deel's latest Tech Migration Report, and U.S. cities accounting for the top five average monthly apartment rent costs, borderless hiring could ease the burden for employment seekers and employment providers in one

""If you could make your single biggest expense, which is talent, 10% more efficient, you have a dramatic advantage,"" Johnson said. Borderless hiring, it seems, will continue to infiltrate the growth playbook at all levels.","Borderless tech hiring has doubled in the last three years, according to Gartner's 2023 CEO Survey.

CNBC,https://www.cnbc.com/2024/06/30/top-wall-street-analysts-favor-these-dividend-stocks-for-better-returns.html,2024-06-30,10:55:21 UTC,Top Wall Street analysts favor these dividend stocks for better returns,"A sign is posted in front of an Olive Garden restaurant on June 20, 2024 in Rohnert Park, California.

Dividend-paying stocks can help investors bolster their portfolios and boost returns.

Investors searching for these names will need to find companies that have a track record of making steady payments, backed by robust financials.

Here are three attractive dividend stocks, according to Wall Street's top pros on TipRanks, a platform that ranks analysts based on their past performance.

Darden Restaurants

The first dividend stock is Darden Restaurants (DRI), which operates several popular brands in full-service dining, including Olive Garden, LongHorn Steakhouse and Yard House. The company recently announced mixed results for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2024. While Darden exceeded analysts' earnings expectations, its sales slightly missed the Street's consensus amid increased discounting by rivals.

Darden issued $628 million in dividends and committed $454 million to share repurchases in fiscal 2024. Moreover, the company announced a dividend hike of nearly 7%, bringing the quarterly dividend to $1.40 per share. The stock has a dividend yield of 3.5%.

Following the results, BTIG analyst Peter Saleh reiterated a buy rating on DRI stock with a price target of $175. The analyst highlighted that at the mid-point, Darden's earnings per share outlook of $9.40 to $9.60 indicates double-digit total shareholder return, which is in line with the company's long-term targets.

Saleh thinks that the company can achieve its targeted return metrics, supported by several factors, including a modest rise in pricing, advertising initiatives and easing inflation.

""We view Darden Restaurants as one of the strongest operators in the industry with historical sales and restaurant margin performance that has consistently exceeded peers,"" said Saleh.

Saleh ranks No. 360 among more than 8,900 analysts tracked by TipRanks. His ratings have been successful 61% of the time, with each delivering an average return of 11.7%. (See Darden's Financial Statements on TipRanks)

International Seaways

Next up is International Seaways (INSW), a tanker company that offers energy transportation services for crude oil and petroleum products. On June 26, the company paid a combined dividend of $1.75 per share. The company's combined dividend represented 60% of its first-quarter adjusted net income.

In its first-quarter results, INSW highlighted that its combined dividend payments of $5.74 per share over the last twelve months reflected a dividend yield of more than 13%.

Following meetings with INSW's management, Stifel analyst Benjamin Nolan reaffirmed a buy rating on the stock and increased the price target to $68 from $66. The analyst noted that the tanker market remains cyclically strong due to a continued increase in global oil consumption, the limited supply of new ships and the longer average voyage lengths caused by the ongoing geopolitical troubles.

Accordingly, Nolan increased his rate assumptions for 2024 and 2025. The analyst expects International Seaways to continue to deliver higher cash flows, fueled by a favorable backdrop for the tanker market.

Nolan expects INSW to sustain high supplemental dividends, given the estimated $200 million to $300 million of excess cash flow after capital expenditure (assuming there is no new debt associated with tanker acquisitions). ""We are modeling $5.51/share in 2024 dividends, although there is room to be a little higher,"" said the analyst.

Nolan ranks No. 68 among more than 8,900 analysts tracked by TipRanks. His ratings have been successful 67% of the time, with each delivering an average return of 19.5%. (See International Seaways' Stock Charts on TipRanks)

Citigroup

Finally, let's discuss this week's third dividend stock, banking giant Citigroup (C). At a quarterly dividend of 53 cents per share, Citigroup offers a yield of 3.3%.

The bank held its Services Investor Day on June 18. Management expressed confidence about achieving the 2024 guidance, driven by revenue growth across all the core businesses despite macro uncertainty and the possibility of lower interest rates.

Following the event, Goldman Sachs analyst Richard Ramsden reiterated a buy rating on Citigroup stock and slightly raised his price target to $72 from $71. The higher price target reflects an increase in the analyst's EPS estimates for 2024, 2025 and 2026 based on management's commentary, which indicated that the bank's strategic transformation plan is gaining momentum.

Ramsden noted that Citi is highly focused on its transformation efforts, with the bank making steady progress on risk control and data quality. Coming to the Services business, the analyst noted that management established strategic priorities for this vital component of the company's financial targets. The analyst estimates that the Services business will account for 25% of the group revenue growth through 2026.

""The Services business is well positioned to maintain their market leading positions with potential to continue share gains across businesses,"" said Ramsden. The analyst's optimism is based on Citi's extensive global network in 95 countries, well-established long-term client relationships, and market share gains that are expected to be driven by investments in technology and innovative offerings.

Ramsden ranks No. 969 among more than 8,900 analysts tracked by TipRanks. His ratings have been successful 65% of the time, with each delivering an average return of 11.9%.

The Economist Intelligence Unit (EIU) released its annual Global Liveability Index 2024, which evaluates cities worldwide for their livability. EIU's report examines 173 cities globally based on 30 indicators organized into five different categories: Stability

Health care

Culture and environment

Education and infrastructure The cities were then ranked on a 100-point scale. For the third year in a row, Vienna, Austria, ranked as the world's best city to live. On the opposite side of the world, not a single city in the U.S. ranked in the top 20 places to live. The report noted that a trend in the U.S. this year is smaller cities outperforming the bigger metropolitan areas. Two of the more popular cities in America, New York and Los Angeles didn't rank in the top 10 — they came in 70th and 58th, respectively.

Honolulu is the best U.S. city to live in

For the second year in a row, Honolulu ranked as the best U.S. city to live in, according to the EIU. It ranked 23 on the global list, up from No. 25 in 2023. The Hawaii city landed in the top spot because of its high scores in education, infrastructure, and stability compared to other U.S. cities.

Living in Honolulu also means living in a city in one of the most expensive states in the U.S., according to CNBC's America's Top States for Business study. It ranked highly based on an index of prices for a range of goods and services. The cost of living in Hawaii is high because of several factors, including the fact that so many items on the island are imported. According to that CNBC study, gas prices in the state are among the nation's highest. Honolulu is also the western metro area with the biggest rent increase for 1-bedroom apartments in a year. Rent in the area went up by 3.3% from $1,783 in 2023 to $1,841 in 2024, according to rent estimate data from Apartment List for April 2023 to April 2024, analyzed by CNBC Make It.

CNBC,https://www.cnbc.com/2024/06/29/obama-clinton-excuse-biden-trump-debate.html,2024-06-29,14:36:53 UTC,"Obama, Clinton excuse Biden's debate performance to fend off Democratic meltdown: 'Bad debate nights happen'","Former US President Barack Obama (L) and former US President Bill Clinton (R) cheer for US President Joe Biden during a campaign fundraising event at Radio City Music Hall in New York City on March 28, 2024.

Former Presidents Barack Obama and Bill Clinton on Friday tried to do some damage control following President Joe Biden's debate fumble against his November election opponent, former President Donald Trump.

""Bad debate nights happen. Trust me, I know. But this election is still a choice between someone who has fought for ordinary folks his entire life and someone who only cares about himself,"" Obama said in a post on X, linking to Biden's campaign website. ""Last night didn't change that, and it's why so much is at stake in November.""

Several hours later, Clinton mimicked the defensive play.

""I'll leave the debate rating to the pundits, but here's what I know: facts and history matter,"" Clinton said in his own post on X, following with a brief list of Biden's accomplishments.

Throughout the 90-minute showdown on Thursday, Biden regularly stumbled, taking mid-sentence pauses to gather his words and tripping over his sentences. The blunders happened even on topics like abortion and the economy, which he tends to be cogent on during campaign rallies and White House events.

The messaging from Obama and Clinton marks a shift in strategy for Democrats as they try to course-correct after Thursday's flop.

Much of Democrats' spin immediately following the debate attempted to play down Biden's conspicuous blunders, instead attacking Trump's performance and giving Biden a generous evaluation.

""As the night went on, I think [Biden] really kind of rose to the occasion,"" Biden co-campaign chair Mitch Landrieu told NBC News Thursday night after the debate. ""I'm proud of the fact that he stood up to Donald Trump.""

The comments from Obama and Clinton represent a new tact: Acknowledge the debate disaster and then tell the public not to focus on it.

Biden himself followed that framing on Friday during a rally in North Carolina: ""Folks, I don't walk as easily as I used to. I don't speak as smoothly as I used to. I don't debate as well as I used to. But I know what I do know: I know how to tell the truth.""

But debates do matter to voters. After the September 2020 debate, a slew of polls found that voters thought Biden did a better job, which helped him maintain his lead against Trump.

This year's presidential race has been a near dead-heat so far and will likely be won by tight margins come November, leaving little room for error.

In the days since the debate, Democrats have been concerned about how it might weigh on voter perceptions, which are already rife with worries about Biden's age and fitness to lead the country for another four years.

Some Democratic strategists, donors and pundits have already suggested that Biden should drop out of the race and reopen the Democratic field to potentially stronger candidates.

The Biden campaign has so far rejected that proposal. Biden and Trump are scheduled to face off at a second and final debate on Sept. 10.","Former Presidents Barack Obama and Bill Clinton on Friday tried to do some damage control following President Joe Biden's debate fumble against his November election opponent, former President Donald Trump.

I had saved $400,000 and had the flexibility to make the leap, but whether it was uncertain streams of income, wanderlust and mostly, the financial benefits of staying put, something had been holding me back. Until November 2023, when I visited a friend at their Fremont, California, apartment complex. When I walked in, it felt like home. As fate would have it, as I was leaving, I met my friend's neighbors, a couple breaking their lease. My gut told me that this was the right moment. After a few hours and some paperwork, I secured a four-month sublease agreement from them for $2,000 a month. It was the perfect transitional space. Once my sublease was up, in April, I moved into a 556-square-foot studio in the same complex for $2,146 a month. DON'T MISS: The ultimate guide to earning passive income online The building is 10 minutes away from the studio I built off of my parent's place where I teach my music students, and less than a 10 minute drive from two beloved local Costco stores. That might seem like an odd amenity to look for in real estate, but to me, it was a huge asset. Altogether, I have spent over $5,000 to outfit my place almost entirely with Costco products.

Why Costco means so much to me

Costco was a shopping staple for my family when I was growing up. And back in 2013, I started going all the time after work, to browse the aisles and try out samples while waiting out the rush hour traffic. Over time, Costco has become more than just a store to me — it's a place for me to belong and feel like myself. My love for it inspired me to create my Instagram account, Costco Claudia. Since launching in winter of 2022, Costco Claudia has become a creative outlet and an income stream. On the account, I primarily post videos of myself modeling women's clothing in the store, and I currently have 191,000 followers and counting. While I have never worked directly with or for Costco, I have had partnerships with brands that are sold by the company.

I currently make about $7,000 a month as an influencer and $5,000 a month from my job as a piano teacher. One of the most surprising and gratifying parts of this experience has been the incredible positivity I've received from my Costco Claudia community. They offered so much comfort and solidarity when I felt most alone, particularly as I learned about my PMDD and navigated living on my own. Their support has helped me through some of my toughest times.

Take a look inside my cozy California studio

For utilities, I spend about $102 a month: $27 for water and trash collection, $30 for internet, and $45 for electricity. Take a look inside: My kitchen is a space to fuel up and get ready for the day Over the years, I've collected a bunch of discounted stuff from Costco sales: glasses, plates, bowls, my NutriBullet, a Brita filter, and loads of snacks.

One of my favorite items in my kitchen is my coffee machine. Photo: Bart Vandever for CNBC Make It

What I really rely on in my kitchen are my coffee machine and the garage ""work table"" — both found at Costco — which doubles as my kitchen table. It's sturdy and looks great with the faux fur sheepskins I use to cover my chairs.

This work table is one of my favorite finds. Photo: Bart Vandever for CNBC Make It

I surround myself with greenery and music in my living room After a long day of teaching, I enjoy winding down in my cozy living room. My forest of growing monsteras and succulents adds a touch of greenery and calmness to the space.

Music brings me so much joy, and this piano gets a lot of use at my place. Photo: Bart Vandever for CNBC Make It

I like to lie on my couch and lose myself in classical music on my piano. Surrounded by blankets, sheepskin rugs, pillows, and stylish tray, it's the perfect way to recharge after a busy day. My bathroom is both luxurious and pragmatic

My bathroom is pretty spacious for a small space, and I found most of my essentials at Costco. Photo: Bart Vandever for CNBC Make It

In my bathroom, the essentials that I can't do without: my gold hoop earrings, my two pairs of glasses and my contacts that I wear every single day. When I first moved out, I found all the bathroom basics I needed at Costco: towels, hand towels, a shower curtain, soap dispenser, and mats. When allergy season strikes, the tissue paper is a lifesaver, since they sell it in bulk. The real steal in my bathroom is the perfume that usually goes for $200 at other stores but is $69.99 at Costco. I've got two of them, and they've become my go-to scents. My bedroom is a haven My $250 bed frame paired with my $500 mattress are so comfortable. I have two sets of Kirkland Signature 680 Thread Count Sheet Set that I snagged when they went on sale. I love my down blanket and I have another favorite I got for $12.

In woven side baskets, I stash my Costco pajamas, keeping everything neat and organized. I also love my Shark Roomba, which cleans my apartment when I'm not here. An outdoor space with possibility The outdoor space isn't fully furnished yet. So far, my Costco paddle board is the centerpiece.

The 30-year-old, who has been competing on the international fencing circuit since she was 15, has relied on her trusty paper planner to make sense of full days that involve lectures, workouts, exams and a lot of studying.

""I sit down and I write every single due date as far into the future as I can,"" she recently told CNBC Make It. ""When I'm done, I cross it off and I know I don't have to deal with it.""

But despite her best organizational efforts, Holmes says it's impossible to avoid burnout while having such a highly demanding schedule. She has, however, learned from past mistakes to mitigate it as best she can.

""When I was going through my first Olympic cycle [in 2016], I definitely got burnt out. I was going 100% all the time,"" Holmes, who spoke with CNBC Make It while promoting her partnership with the fitness coaching app Future, said.

CNBC,https://www.cnbc.com/2024/06/30/how-to-avoid-job-scams-online-according-to-career-experts.html,2024-06-30,13:40:01 UTC,"How to avoid scams while job-hunting online, according to career experts","Landing a job has become more difficult, even while the labor market may look robust — and it's a situation that scammers are eager to exploit. It's a big enough issue that federal agencies like the FBI and Federal Trade Commission have issued warnings about job scams. One common scheme: Swindlers who pose as recruiters and contact you unprompted — including on job boards like Indeed and LinkedIn or even through WhatsApp messages — to entice you with a job opportunity you didn't apply for. Then, they may ask you to send them money or personal information, according to Amanda Augustine, a career expert at TopResume. Or they might claim that you first need to complete their training course or coaching services to be eligible for their job opening in a predatory attempt to sell you their products, she says. While real recruiters do often reach out cold to potential hires, there's a key difference between them and the grifters: ""They're straightforward with you,"" says career and leadership coach Phoebe Gavin. Here are ways to spot and protect yourself from a con while job-hunting.

Be skeptical if the job looks too perfect

If a job posting ""seems too good to be true,"" it probably is, Augustine says. That includes openings promising to make you a lot of money fast. In those ""get-rich-quick"" instances, ""run for the hills,"" Augustine cautions. Be wary if a company is quick to offer you a position without going through the standard vetting procedure. A legitimate process should require at least one interview, even if it's only over the phone, she says. Still, an interview doesn't guarantee the role is above board. Scammers sometimes hold phony interviews using text chat and video messaging to obtain your personal information without blowing their cover, according to ZipRecruiter. Some duped job hunters have taken to social media to share their experiences with fake interviews. LinkedIn blocked more than 63 million fake accounts during the second half of 2023, according to its most recent community report. The platform also removed more than 108 million pieces of spam and scam content over the same period, per the report. The job site is ""committed to ensuring the platform remains authentic, secure, and easy to use for members,"" said Oscar Rodriguez, LinkedIn's vice president of trust product management, in a statement. Ultimately, if a recruiter reaches out to you for an unusually attractive job you haven't applied for, ""you need to be especially suspicious,"" Augustine says.

Question vague or nonexistent job descriptions

Sometimes a disguised fraudster will insist they can't provide any details because a job posting is confidential. But generally, if a company can't produce a copy of the job description, that's a big red flag, Augustine says. Some companies make executive-level job openings confidential to high-profile applicants at first, but they will begin disclosing more details about the role as the interview process gets underway. ""If you are not at a director level or above and someone is approaching you for a confidential listing, it's probably a scam, because there isn't really much reason for a company to be cagey about hiring an individual contributor or a manager-level position,"" Gavin says. ""It's those senior-level positions that can have some PR consequences if it is known that they're doing a search."" For job openings that have no reason being kept so tightly under wraps, a formal job description should be handed over upon request, Augustine explains. You should also watch out for job descriptions that are ""really vague"" and fail to offer enough information about the job title, location, key responsibilities and qualifications. A job description riddled with typos and errors can also indicate a scam. Because of new tools powered by artificial intelligence like ChatGPT that can fix grammatical issues in text, however, Augustine says this clue is becoming less prominent.

Check the company's online footprint

You should be able to locate a company's digital presence, Augustine says. That could be a LinkedIn profile, website or social media page. ""Even your mom-and-pop ice cream shop has a Facebook page these days,"" she says. ""If there's absolutely no digital trail about this company, or it's really, really sparse when you're running some Google searches, I would be concerned."" Ask a prospective employer to direct you to their website — where you can also see if the job listing is posted — and double-check any links you receive to make sure they don't route to a phishing website, Gavin suggests. Exercise caution if a recruiter is not using a corporate email address, Augustine says. You may find third-party recruiters who use a Gmail account, but internal recruiters typically have a company email address, she notes. Also, watch out for communications from email addresses with misspellings or ""spoofed"" company names that are similar but slightly different from the actual business name, according to Indeed's guidelines for a safe job search. If you're still unsure whether a company is legitimate, Augustine suggests searching the company's name along with the word ""scam"" on Google. That search may turn up a history of dishonest activity if it's an illicit enterprise that has struck before.

Then, they may ask you to send them money or personal information, according to Amanda Augustine, a career expert at TopResume.
Some companies make executive-level job openings confidential to high-profile applicants at first, but they will begin disclosing more details about the role as the interview process gets underway.
For job openings that have no reason being kept so tightly under wraps, a formal job description should be handed over upon request, Augustine explains.

CNBC,https://www.cnbc.com/2024/06/30/fathom-joint-venture-of-amc-regal-cinemark-makes-major-gains.html,2024-06-30,15:21:20 UTC,"Fathom, the company behind classic films at your local theater, is making major gains in moviegoing","At a time when the box office is starved for content and audiences seem pickier than ever, Fathom Events is posting record revenue gains.

For 20 years, the joint venture between AMC , Regal and Cinemark has been best known for bringing alternative content to the big screen in the form of classic Hollywood titles, live telecasts of theater and opera productions, concerts and even television series.

Most recently, it ventured into the specialty distribution space to deliver ""The Blind,"" ""The Chosen,"" ""Jesus Thirsts: The Miracle of the Eucharist"" and ""Waitress: the Musical"" to audiences. Still to come is ""Andrea Bocelli 30: The Celebration.""

In 2023, Fathom generated $100 million at the box office, a 116% increase over 2019 levels and its highest-grossing year ever. And that momentum has continued into 2024, as the company tallied $43 million in the first quarter, up nearly 140% compared to the $18 million it tallied in the year-earlier period.

Fathom's relationships with Hollywood's biggest studios and its cinematic reach — as the partnership of the industry's three biggest theater chains — has made it a formidable force at the box office. Its value proposition is twofold: It breathes new life into older films, and into theaters.

""Falling mostly under the event film banner, anniversary titles have truly come into vogue seemingly more so now than in years past with a particular emphasis given to these beloved older films,"" said Paul Dergarabedian, senior media analyst at Comscore. ""These anniversary re-releases are a win-win, providing joy to movie fans and notably additional revenues to movie theaters often decades after initial theatrical run.""

In post-pandemic times, Fathom has acted as a crutch for many smaller cinema operators, providing much-needed content for the big screen amid a drought caused by pandemic and strike-related production shutdowns.

Season 4 of ""The Chosen,"" a faith-based television show about the life of Jesus, generated $32 million at the box office for Fathom, around 75% of its first-quarter haul.

""'The Chosen' was through [Fathom], and it was huge for us,"" said Brock Bagby, president and chief content, programming and development officer at B&B Theatres. ""It gave us a lot of extra revenue in February and the beginning of March that we wouldn't have had.""

Fathom has also benefited from its anniversary titles and classic cinema showings. Each year, the company brings films back to theaters to celebrate milestone years alongside fan-favorite titles.

""We've seen that there's a growing segment in the box office, people that are interested in seeing older films on the big screen,"" said Jordan Hohman, vice president of project development at Phoenix Theatres. ""These audiences are getting to enjoy classic films, either for the first time or for the first time, in a new way. I think that that's valuable.""

This year, the company celebrated the 85th anniversaries of ""The Wizard of Oz"" and ""Gone with the Wind"" as well as the 35th anniversary of ""Steel Magnolias."" Still on the calendar is the 50th anniversary of ""Blazing Saddles,"" the 70th anniversary of Alfred Hitchcock's ""Rear Window,"" the 40th anniversary of ""Neverending Story"" and the 20th anniversary of ""Mean Girls.""

It also has a film series called Studio Ghibli Fest, which features 14 films from the studio in their original Japanese and English dubbed versions. This year, the lineup boasts the 20th anniversary of ""Howl's Moving Castle,"" the 35th anniversary of ""Kiki's Delivery Service"" and the 30th anniversary of ""Pom Poko.""

And these titles can generate big box-office hauls even decades after they were first released.

Fathom's three-weekend run of the original Lord of the Rings trilogy resulted in $8.2 million at the box office.

""Lord of the Rings was wildly successful nationwide, and for us,"" Bagby said. ""We just did 4DX Lord of the Rings this weekend in our new Dallas theater, and we sold out every single show.""

4DX is a screen format that utilizes motion seats, practical effects and sensory elements to immerse viewers in a movie experience.

Audiences are already buying tickets for showings in August celebrating the 15th anniversary of ""Coraline,"" which will be shown widely in 3D for the first time since its original release.

Fathom re-released ""Coraline"" twice before with great success. In 2022, the film showed in 800 theaters for one day and tallied $1.2 million in ticket sales. Last year, the film extended its release to five days and snared $7.1 million, making it the highest-grossing classic film release in Fathom history.

That $7.1 million figure is about 10% of the initial domestic run for ""Coraline"" in 2009 and 42% of its opening weekend, according to data from Comscore.

What's more, 53% of the audience who attended screenings of the film last year were 34 years old or younger.

""New audiences are seeing it for the first time although the film is 15 years old,"" said Ray Nutt, CEO of Fathom Events.

Fathom reports presales for this year's screenings of ""Coraline"" are selling seven times as many tickets per location as were sold during the same period last year, with two-thirds of those ticket sales for the 3D version of the film.

Because Fathom has a wide footprint through its parent companies and nationwide marketing, it does the heavy lifting for smaller theater chains.

""[Fathom has] built a lot of relationships,"" Phoenix Theatre's Hohman said. ""They worked out the licensing and they created the marketing behind re-releasing these classic films that, you know, we just can't do ourselves. It's a national campaign. So, I think that they just offer a lot of value.""","At a time when the box office is starved for content and audiences seem pickier than ever, Fathom Events is posting record revenue gains.

France will hold an early legislative election in two rounds on June 30 and July 7 2024, following President Emmanuel Macrons decision which was triggered by his party's heavy defeat to the far-right National Rally in the 2024 European Parliament election.

French voters are heading to the polls on Sunday for the first round of voting in a snap parliamentary election that could see the far-right National Rally group become the biggest party in France's National Assembly, polls suggest. France's President Emmanuel Macron shocked the electorate and political pundits in early June when he called the ballot after his Renaissance party suffered a drubbing in European Parliament elections at the hands of National Rally, led by Jordan Bardella and veteran right-wing politician Marine Le Pen.

Calling the snap election, which involves two rounds of polling on Sunday and on July 7, Macron said the vote would provide ""clarification"" and that ""France needs a clear majority to act in serenity and harmony."" Analysts said Macron's shock move was likely based on the gamble that, even if National Rally performs well, a potentially chaotic and disordered period in power will reduce the likelihood that his rival Le Pen will assume French leadership in 2027. Close watchers of French politics also note that Macron is ultimately betting on French citizens fearing a far-right government and voting against the nationalist and anti-immigration party. But voter polls in June have consistently put National Rally ahead in the race, predicting the party will take around 35% of the vote, ahead of the leftist New Popular Front bloc with around 25-26% of the ballot and Macron's centrist Together alliance, in third place with around 19% of the vote.

Even if a hung parliament is the most likely outcome of the vote — with no single party looking as if it can achieve an absolute majority of 289 seats in the 577-seat National Assembly — a strong showing for National Rally will put pressure on Macron to appoint a prime minister from the party. That new PM — who in this scenario would likely be the 28-year-old National Rally President Jordan Bardella — would then have a significant say over France's domestic and economic policy, while President Macron would remain in charge of foreign policy and defense.

In any case, such an outcome would force ideologically different (and often opposed) politicians into an uneasy and awkward ""cohabitation"" where government is likely fractious and unstable, prompting some concern among economists as to how the vote could affect the euro zone's second-largest economy. ""The market has reacted negatively to the election uncertainty, with French equities underperforming and the France-Germany 10-year yield spread widening,"" Peter Garnry, head of Strategy at Saxo Bank, said in a note Monday. ""Despite this, some views suggest the market may be overreacting, drawing parallels to Italy's experience under Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni, whose initially feared policies were more pragmatic than expected,"" he noted.

Political analysts point out that a period of hard bargaining is likely to follow the election, as parties look to forge alliances that would enable them to achieve parliamentary majority and govern as fractiously as possible. It could be a torturous process, analysts warn. ""As with the 2022 elections, no party or bloc is likely to secure enough seats to form a majority government, although some polls give the RN an outside chance of doing so. The next government is highly likely to require some form of negotiation between different parties,"" George Dyson, senior analyst at Control Risks said in analysis Monday. ""In the event that the RN secures enough votes to come close to forming a government, it will potentially be able to secure support from dissident members of the [center-right] Republicans to secure a majority or argue that no other government is feasible."" Dyson noted that, as current polling suggests that the united left bloc will be the second largest in parliament after the RN, the next administration may also conceivably be a left-wing government that can cobble together support from the Republicans and Macron's centrist Renaissance party. ""Macron will likely push for support from centrist parties to put forwards a candidate of his choosing for prime minister, but the parties would be unlikely to provide their support as his party is projected to perform very poorly,"" Dyson said.

Pride month is winding down — and this year, the corporate world took a more cautious approach. June tends to bring a wave of rainbow-themed merchandise and affirming ads and social media posts from retailers and consumers brands, coinciding with parades and other events that celebrate the LGBTQ+ community. As the presidential election approaches, however, some companies have grown quieter about diversity, equity and inclusion efforts to avoid stepping into the culture wars or facing the blowback from conservative customers that Target and Bud Light did a year ago. The starkest example of that came late Thursday: Tractor Supply, a retailer that sells animal feed, cowboy boots and lawn supplies in rural parts of the country, said it is ending all spending tied to diversity and environmental causes. That includes no longer sponsoring Pride festivals, the statement said. The move, while an outlier in its magnitude, underscores how some companies that made inclusion commitments in recent years are treading cautiously. It is difficult to track how many companies shared supportive messages, donated to LGBTQ+ causes or sold rainbow-themed merchandise in June compared to previous years. According to Gravity Research, a Washington, D.C.-based reputational research firm, 45% of Fortune 100 companies had at least one social media post on LinkedIn or X explicitly related to Pride as of June 21 this year, compared with 51% last June. Gravity Research President Luke Hartig said the volatility of the presidential election and the two candidates' willingness to call out companies by name has also made companies less likely to go public about their stand. ""There's a little bit of like, 'keep our heads down while we go through this election,'"" he said. Tim Bennett, cofounder of Tribury Productions, a marketing company that specializes in reaching LGBTQ+ Americans, works with Fortune 500 companies, including recent projects with Procter & Gamble. He said more clients have taken ""a wait-and-see"" approach to marketing to LGBTQ+ consumers or decided to scatter efforts throughout the year instead of making a big splash in a single month. ""June this year has not been like the last five or six,"" Bennett said. That may not be a bad thing for LGBTQ+ initiatives and charities. Sarah Kate Ellis, CEO of nonprofit advocacy group GLAAD, said she's seeing more companies get involved with year-round philanthropy and activism in more meaningful ways. She also pointed to a survey by Gravity Research that found that 78% of companies did not plan to change their Pride strategy this year. Thirteen percent were unsure whether they'd make changes and 9% said they planned to revise their strategy. Gravity Research surveyed 45 corporate executives and Fortune 500 leaders across industries in April. ""The visibility of companies putting flags out and having product to celebrate our Pride and to mark a month that's really significant and important for our community is really important, and I don't want to ever devalue that,"" Ellis said. ""I do think, though, those companies must look inside and make sure that they have the policies and the HR practices that match their outward marketing."" Major companies are still writing checks for LGBTQ+ causes, too. A GLAAD spokesperson said Friday that the group has not seen donations or corporate support decline this Pride month, though it does not yet have a total tally. On Friday, when the Stonewall National Monument Visitor Center officially opened its doors to commemorate the New York City bar that was a catalyst in the LGBTQ+ rights movement, the event had major backing from the business community. Supporters included Google, Amazon, JPMorgan Chase and Booking.com. President Joe Biden also made an appearance and remarks at the monument's opening.

The Bud Light and Target effect

Consumer staples brands were the most likely to say they planned to shift their Pride month strategy this year, according to Gravity Research's survey. That may stem from the conservative boycotts of Target and Bud Light last year. Target has carried a Pride collection for over a decade. Yet last year, the big-box retailer removed some items and moved displays after employees faced threats. Boycotters targeted items for transgender shoppers, such as ""tuck-friendly"" swimsuits, and also criticized separate Pride merchandise for kids. Instead of putting Pride merchandise in all stores this year, Target only carried it in the locations that accounted for 90% of total Pride sales in 2022 and 2023. It also stopped selling any Pride apparel for kids. On the company's website and in those select stores, shoppers can find a wide variety of Pride-themed items. The volume of negative feedback to the Pride collection externally and internally is ""significantly lower"" this year than in 2023, according to a Target spokesperson. In a statement, Target said it is ""committed to supporting the LGBTQIA+ community during Pride Month and year-round"" and would participate in Pride events across the country and support LGBTQ+ groups, in addition to offering Pride products.

Anheuser-Busch InBev and other large beer brands, on the other hand, have backed away from public support of the LGBTQ+ community. Conservatives like singer Kid Rock and Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis called for a boycott of the beer and its parent company, Anheuser-Busch InBev, after Bud Light sent personalized cans of its beer to transgender influencer Dylan Mulvaney. The marketing campaign coincided with the March Madness college basketball tournament. Bud Light sales tumbled around 25%, and the brand lost its spot as the best-selling beer in the U.S., ceding the position it held for more than two decades to Constellation Brands' Modelo. AB InBev distanced itself from Mulvaney and fired Bud Light's vice president of marketing. In October, AB InBev CEO Michel Doukeris said the brand would focus its marketing more on events like sports games and concerts. It also returned as the official sponsor of the UFC. In recent months, some consumers have returned to Bud Light, as RBC Europe analysts estimate that the brand's U.S. volume is down only about 10% these days. For its part, Bud Light hasn't posted in support of Pride month on its Instagram or X pages this year. The boycott was unusually sticky for a few reasons, according to Neil Reid, a geography professor at the University of Toledo who researches the beer industry. Studies have shown that consumers' loyalty to top-selling beers may be more tied to the brand than the taste, Reid said. Right-wing news outlets like Fox News also devoted plenty of airtime to the controversy, stretching its duration and potentially reaching new consumers who missed the initial reaction. Plus, once Bud Light sales fell, retailers gave more shelf space to its rivals. ""You can look at this issue from a moral, ethical perspective or you can also look at it from a pure business perspective. Those two often don't result in the same strategy,"" Reid said.

The New York Stock Exchange welcomes e.l.f. Beauty (NYSE: ELF), on March 18, 2024, to the podium to celebrate its 20th anniversary of founding. To honor the occasion, Tarang Amin, Chairman & CEO, joined by Tara Dziedzic, NYSE Head of Listings - U.S. Sectors, rings The Opening Bell®.

CNBC,https://www.cnbc.com/2024/06/30/melinda-french-gates-the-best-lesson-i-got-from-charlie-munger.html,2024-06-30,13:30:01 UTC,Melinda French Gates shares the best lesson she got from Charlie Munger: ‘What a thing to aspire to’,"Charlie Munger wasn't just an acclaimed investor, one of the masterminds behind Berkshire Hathaway's decades of financial success.

He also gave great life advice, according to billionaire philanthropist Melinda French Gates.

French Gates, 59, shared her favorite lesson of Munger's during a recent commencement speech at Stanford University. ""Charlie famously said that the highest form which civilization can reach is a seamless web of deserved trust. Totally reliable people, correctly trusting each other,"" she said. ""What a thing to aspire to.""

""As a society, we aren't always set up to feel responsibility for the person who's next to us or the person who's on the other side of a divide or a debate,"" French Gates added. ""But we need each other. No matter who you are, there will be moments in your journey when you need to be carried or when someone else will need you to carry them.""

Munger, who died last year at age 99, spent decades as the vice-chairman of Berkshire Hathaway — Warren Buffett's longtime business partner and right-hand man. His advice often extended beyond finance and investing, and was usually shaped by his down-to-earth demeanor and optimistic outlook on life.

For most people, connections can play a major role in your personal or professional success. Bosses and mentors may help you excel in the workplace or open their network to you. Your friends might give you great relationship advice. Even a stranger at the grocery store could introduce you to a new brand of food that you grow to love.

Assembling connections intentionally is even a leadership strategy: Lisa Skeete Tatum, founder and CEO of career coaching company Landit, told CNBC Make It in 2022 about the personal board of directors she created to help her make decisions, provide a listening ear or speak up on her behalf.

""I would not be where I am today if it wasn't for people who believed in me,"" said Skeete Tatum. ""If you want to progress, you have to surround yourself with people that have higher expectations of you than you have of yourself.""

DON'T MISS: The ultimate guide to becoming a master communicator and public speaker

Her comments echoed Munger's lesson that people can go much further together than they can alone, and by being a caring, trustworthy person, others will provide you that same kind of support. Similarly, French Gates urged her audience to make ""strong, reciprocal bonds with other people, even if they disagree on issues big or small.""

""You are graduating into a broken world, but it is community that rebuilds things,"" she said. ""Together is how you'll make the broken things whole again.""

CNBC,https://www.cnbc.com/2024/06/30/how-life-expectancy-figures-into-retirement-planning.html,2024-06-30,13:00:01 UTC,How long you may live is one of retirement planning's biggest unknowns. How experts say to get the best estimate,"Peopleimages | Istock | Getty Images

To effectively plan for your retirement, experts say, you need to watch your savings rate and total nest egg. But how much you really need to have set aside depends on another number — your life expectancy. Yet that figure is also the most elusive — no one knows how long they will live. ""Nobody really knows, and that uncertainty is uncomfortable,"" said Lisa Schilling, director of practice research at the Society of Actuaries Research Institute, the research arm of the Society of Actuaries. The financial industry typically uses age 95 as a default assumption, according to research from HealthView Services, a provider of health-care cost projection software. More from Personal Finance:

Why inflation is still upending retirement plans

Older voters want candidates who will protect Social Security

Workers in certain industries tend to have higher 401(k) balances Instead of planning for one life expectancy number, the Society of Actuaries and American Academy of Actuaries emphasize longevity. Longevity risk measures the likelihood someone may live longer than expected and outlive their savings. ""If you read that life expectancy is 84 and you are planning on your money lasting until 84, there's a big surprise behind the curtain that you haven't opened,"" Schilling said. ""There's a really good chance for a lot of reasons that you might need your money to last longer than that.""

Longevity estimates may bring surprises

The Society of Actuaries and American Academy of Actuaries recently relaunched a free online longevity illustrator. The tool asks for basic information on either an individual or a couple: age, sex, retirement age, smoking status and a description of their general health — poor, average or excellent. The results aim to provide a ""reasonable"" estimate of how long you might live, according to the organizations. The illustrations show the probability of living to certain ages, as well as the number of years of life one might live in retirement. Generally, the higher your current age, the greater the possibility you may live longer. While life expectancy at birth may be 84, it will be even longer if you've already made it to age 65, Schilling said.

The results may help individuals fully understand the range of possibilities when planning for how long their money may need to last, she said. For couples, there is also another revelation that often comes as a surprise. ""The chance that at least one of you lives to 90 is even bigger,"" Schilling said. Yet the financial industry's assumption of living to age 95 may be too generous, according to recent research from HealthView Services. The projected life expectancy for someone who is 65 years old today with no chronic conditions is age 90 for women and age 88 for men. Yet only around 5% of people over 60 have no chronic conditions, according to the research.

Health status affects life expectancy projections

Chronic health conditions such as high blood pressure, cardiovascular disease, cancer, diabetes, high cholesterol, tobacco use, obesity or Parkinson's disease reduce an individual's projected life expectancy. For example, while a healthy 65-year-old man with no chronic conditions has a 19.3% probability of living to age 95 or longer, that gets reduced to a 17.5% chance if he has high blood pressure, 15.8% if he has cardiovascular disease, 12.5% for high cholesterol, 8.8% for obesity with a body mass index of 35 to 39, 7.4% for tobacco use, 2% for obesity with body mass index of 40 to 44 and to just 0.4% for diabetes, according to the research. Those probabilities could mean a huge difference to his retirement funding needs. A healthy 65-year-old man may need around $1.1 million to maintain the 80% income replacement rate he needs if he was earning $100,000 in 2023, according to HealthView Services. This assumes he lives to age 95, has a 6% annual portfolio return, receives Social Security benefits, and inflation is 3%.

However, if that 65-year-old man has a chronic condition, his life expectancy will be lower. And that could free up more of that retirement nest egg to be spent in other ways, according to HealthView Services. High blood pressure could reduce his life expectancy by nine years to age 86, and therefore allow for $447,469 to be used for long-term care planning, emergency savings, money for heirs or other uses, the research found. Tobacco use could reduce his life expectancy by 13 years to 82, freeing up $616,245, the research estimates, while diabetes may reduce his lifespan by 16 years, enabling him to spend $727,947. Most experts advise individuals to plan for outliving their assets by delaying Social Security retirement benefits or considering an annuity to amplify monthly income.

How personalized numbers can help","""Nobody really knows, and that uncertainty is uncomfortable,"" said Lisa Schilling, director of practice research at the Society of Actuaries Research Institute, the research arm of the Society of Actuaries.

Asia-Pacific markets started the second half of the year mixed as investors assessed June business activity data from China as well as Japan's business confidence readings.

China released its official PMI figures on the weekend, with its manufacturing PMI coming in at 49.5, unchanged from May and marking its second straight month in contraction territory.

A private survey of manufacturing activity, however, diverged from the official numbers, showing the sharpest improvement in business conditions in three years. The S&P Caixin PMI climbed to 51.8 in June compared with 51.7 in May.

On Monday, Japan revised its first-quarter GDP contraction to 2.9% year on year, from 1.8% reported earlier. GDP data for the third and fourth quarters of 2023 were also revised downward.

In a technical note, the country's cabinet office said the revision was due to new construction investment data.","SHANGHAI, CHINA - JANUARY 01: Sun rises over the Oriental Pearl Tower on New Year's Day on January 1, 2023 in Shanghai, China.

For the third year in a row, Vienna, the capital of Austria, is the world's most livable city, according to the Economist Intelligence Unit.

The annual report, which aims to show how comfortable or livable a city is, examined 173 cities globally based on 30 indicators organized into five categories: stability, health care, culture and environment, education and infrastructure.

Boosted by its perfect scores for stability, health care, education and infrastructure, Vienna led this year's list, followed closely by its Western European counterparts: Copenhagen, Denmark, in second place and Zurich, Switzerland, in third.

Vienna's overall score took a minor hit in the culture and environment categories, ""owing to a lack of major sporting events,"" according to the EIU Global Liveability Index for 2024.

""EIU's Liveability Index has risen fractionally over the past year,"" the report said. ""Declines in stability and infrastructure across a number of cities in advanced economies were offset by structural improvements in healthcare and education in several cities in developing markets.""

Here are the 10 most livable cities in the world, according to EIU.

Vienna, Austria Copenhagen, Denmark Zurich, Switzerland Melbourne, Australia Calgary, Canada Geneva, Switzerland Sydney, Australia Vancouver, Canada Osaka, Japan Auckland, New Zealand

Four Asia-Pacific cities made it to this year's top 10: Australian cities Melbourne and Sydney, as well as Osaka, Japan, and Auckland, New Zealand.

Melbourne, Sydney and Vancouver made the top 10 this year, but slipped ""amid a significant shortfall in housing availability,"" the EIU said. For the same reason, Toronto fell to 12th place this year, after ranking among the top 10 in the previous two years.

Western Europe was the best-performing region for livability globally, scoring an overall 92 out of 100. However, it has dropped since last year due to an increase in protests and crime, which weighed on the stability category, according to the report.

North America was the second best region, scoring an average of 90.5 out of 100, and ranking highest for education. The ongoing housing crisis in Canada has dragged down the region's infrastructure scores, EIU said.","Vienna, Austria is the wrold's most ""liveable"" city, according to the Economist Intelligence Unit's 2024 Global Liveability Index.

Dow lags tech rally

The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose about 3.8% in the first six months of the year, lagging way behind the Nasdaq, up 18.1%, and the S&P 500, which jumped 14.5% — as investors plowed into artificial intelligence-related stocks. On Friday, the S&P 500 and Nasdaq hit record highs before pulling back. The yield on the 10-year Treasury rose as investors digested the latest inflation data. U.S. oil prices rose for the third straight week amid fears of a war between Israel and the Iran-backed militia Hezbollah.

Boeing 'guilty plea'

U.S. prosecutors plan to seek a guilty plea from Boeing over a charge related to two fatal 737 Max crashes in 2018 and 2019, attorneys for the victims' family members said. The Justice Department is reviewing whether Boeing violated a 2021 settlement that shielded the company from federal charges. Boeing agreed then to pay a $2.5 billion penalty for a conspiracy charge tied to the crashes. The DOJ revisited the agreement after a door panel blew out of a new 737 Max 9 in January, sparking a new safety crisis.

Under fire

Nike CEO John Donahoe faces growing discontent as the company's stock plummeted 20% on Friday, its worst day since 1980, after forecasting a significant decline in sales. As Wall Street digested the dismal outlook from the world's largest sportswear company, at least six investment banks downgraded Nike's stock. Analysts at Morgan Stanley and Stifel took it a step further, specifically calling the company's management into question.

Bitcoin windfall

Mt. Gox, a bankrupt Japanese bitcoin exchange, is set to repay creditors nearly $9 billion worth of Bitcoin following a 2011 hack. The court-appointed trustee overseeing the exchange's bankruptcy proceedings said distributions to the firm's roughly 20,000 creditors would begin this month. The payout is likely to be a windfall for those who waited a decade, with Bitcoin's value surging from around $600 in 2014 to over $60,000 today. One claimant, Gregory Greene, could potentially receive $2.5 million for his $25,000 investment.

Inflation cooling

A key inflation measure, watched closely by the Federal Reserve, slowed to its lowest annual rate in over three years in May, with the core personal consumption expenditures price index rising 2.6% from a year ago. ""This is just additional news that monetary policy is working, inflation is gradually cooling,"" San Francisco Fed President Mary Daly told CNBC's Andrew Ross Sorkin during a ""Squawk Box"" interview. ""That's a relief for businesses and households who have been struggling with persistently high inflation. It's good news for how policy is working.""

[PRO] Rally will broaden

The tech sector has driven market performance in 2024, with the S&P 500 tech group up 28% and Nvidia soaring 149%, while small-caps have lagged. Oppenheimer's chief market strategist John Stoltzfus believes the rally will broaden.

China has stepped up its aggression against the Philippines in the contested waters of the South China Sea, calling into question the strength of American deterrence, according to policy analysts. Last week, the Chinese coast guard seized two Filipino ships on a resupply mission to an outpost on the Second Thomas Shoal in the Spratly Islands, severely injuring a navy personnel, according to Philippine officials. The shoal is claimed by both Manila and Beijing. The area has seen several clashes over the past months. Experts say the latest incident represents an escalation and shows the limitations of the U.S.-Philippines Mutual Defense Treaty signed in 1951. ""The failure of the MDT to deter the [latest confrontation] shows the vagueness in the conveyed commitments of the two parties,"" said Chester Cabalza, president and founder of the Philippines-based think tank International Development and Security Cooperation.

Last year, the Philippines and U.S. released new ""Bilateral Defense Guidelines,"" reaffirming that an ""armed attack"" in the South China Sea on Filipino vessels would invoke mutual defense obligations of the U.S. China, on its part, has been careful not to trigger the MDT by avoiding the use of guns, instead employing ""gray zone"" tactics — coercive actions that fall short of an armed conflict — at the Second Thomas Shoal. These reportedly have included the use of water cannons and ramming into Philippine boats.

U.S. 'gray zone' conundrum

Beijing's actions aim to stop resupply missions to a rusted Philippine vessel grounded on the shoal since 1999, as its existence there appears to lend credence to the Philippines' claim on the reef. According to Cabalza, unless Manila and Washington do more to increase deterrence, Beijing will continue to employ ""gray zone"" tactics in its attempt to win the shoal and other areas contested by the Philippines. ""The usage of these tactics should be classified as an armed attack [in the MDT] if the U.S. is serious about helping the Philippines in its strategic and asymmetrical warfare with China,"" he said.

An expanded definition of an ""armed attack"" in the treaty could include ""any willful act to inflict injury or that leads to fatality on Filipinos,"" said Richard Heydarian, policy adviser and senior lecturer of international affairs at the University of the Philippines. Those guidelines are consistent with the interpretation of the MDT in a report by the U.S. Indo-Pacific Command that was unclassified last year. However, according to Heydarian, a muted Philippine reaction to last week's clash could be a sign of its apprehensions with regard to invoking the mutual defense treaty.

""The Philippine Government is confronted with a huge dilemma. It wants greater reassurance from the United States, but it's likely not getting that, and it also wants to avoid unwanted escalation,"" said Heydarian. ""It's extremely important for the Philippines and U.S. to signal that Filipino troops are empowered and sanctioned to use live firearms to defend themselves, and that usage of live firearms by China would immediately trigger the MDT,"" he added. However, according to Abdul Rahman Yaacob, a research fellow at the Lowy Institute's Southeast Asia Program, the U.S. is unlikely to widen the scope of the defense pact, as doing so could draw them into a wider military conflict.

Amid a ""sober assessment on the risk of U.S. non-involvement,"" the Philippines will also look to step up its own deterrence and strategy in asserting its territorial claims, according to Matteo Piasentini, China and Indo-Pacific analyst at Geopolitica, an Italian think tank. Philippine President Ferdinand Marcos Jr. said on Thursday that while the latest incident at the shoal was not an ""armed attack,"" the country needs to ""do more"" than protest China's actions.

""The Philippines will continue to resupply the Sierra Madre, and hopefully invest in more outposts in their Exclusive Economic Zone in the South China Sea ... There is no illusion that China will give up; what Manila is trying to do is not to give up on its own,"" Paisentini said. The Philippines defense chief has reiterated that the military would not announce its resupply missions to the shoal in advance. According to the Lowy Institute's Yaacob, this could help it outmaneuver Beijing while avoiding direct confrontations. The country has also been working to bolster its own defense capabilities in the South China Sea with the support of the U.S.

What's at stake?

The Second Thomas Shoal is emblematic of how great powers are becoming involved in the security architecture in Asia, with states such as the Philippines increasingly turning to the U.S. and other powers to increase deterrence and security, according to Geopolitica's Paisentini. ""Non intervention [ if China gets more aggressive] would cause a massive blow not only in U.S.-Philippines relations, but also in the relationship between the U.S. and other key regional allies,"" he added.

Honor

HANGZHOU, China — The transforming power of artificial intelligence is of no value unless user data is protected, CEO of Chinese smartphone company Honor, George Zhao, told CNBC in an exclusive interview on Thursday. His comments come as Apple this month announced it will start rolling out personalized AI tools on certain devices in the U.S. this fall. Honor already integrates some AI functions, such as enabling users to open text messages and other notifications just by looking at them, or eliminating copy-paste steps by directly linking Yelp-like apps to navigation or ride-hailing apps. This week at Mobile World Congress in Shanghai, Honor unveiled new AI tools for detecting the use of deepfakes in videos, and for simulating lenses that can decrease myopia during long hours of screen usage. Zhao emphasized that Honor's approach is to keep AI operations involving personal data limited to the smartphone. It's also known as on-device AI, and stands in contrast with AI tools that tap cloud computing to operate.

""Without data security and user privacy protection, AI will become worthless,"" Zhao said in Mandarin, translated by CNBC. ""This has always been one of our value propositions."" ""We say user data doesn't leave [the device],"" Zhao said. ""This is a principle we adhere to."" Apple Intelligence, the iPhone company's AI product, claims that it uses on-device processing and draws on ""server-based models"" for more complex requests. Apple said its new ""Private Cloud Compute"" never stores user data. Honor says its on-device AI is self-developed, and the company is working with Baidu and Google Cloud for some other AI features. ""Overall, my view is that AI's development to date has two directions,"" Zhao said. ""Network [cloud] AI has become more and more powerful. But I believe on-device AI, in its capabilities and empowerment of consumers, will become more and more intimate, more and more understanding."" ""It will give consumers more support and help them interact with the future AI world,"" he added.

Zhao pointed out that many generative AI applications, such as from OpenAI's ChatGPT, require large amounts of computing power well beyond the battery capability of a single smartphone. That means they need to use the cloud, which raises questions about the security of data transfer. Balancing AI capabilities with energy usage and data privacy is a ""huge challenge"" for manufacturers, Zhao said. He said a system collecting lots of user data to deliver more personalized features becomes a ""stronger"" object compared to the individual using the system. ""In the future development of smartphones, our goal is that the individual becomes stronger,"" Zhao said. ""When an object becomes stronger, this will reveal the smallness of the individual in its presence. I believe mobile end devices need to empower and enable individuals.""

This report is from this week's CNBC's ""Inside India"" newsletter which brings you timely, insightful news and market commentary on the emerging powerhouse and the big businesses behind its meteoric rise. Like what you see? You can subscribe here.

A curry without onions would be considered blasphemous by much of India.

So, even a modest change in the price of the bulbous vegetable soon becomes the talking point around dinner tables for hundreds of millions of people in the country.

And it has been for the past year.

The price of raw onions has risen 165% over the past year, according to the Lasalgaon Agriculture Produce Market Committee, which is India's largest wholesale onion market. Prices have also inflated for other vegetables, such as tomatoes, which now cost nearly twice as much as this time last year.

Poor weather has been behind much of the havoc. The drought last year and the ongoing heatwave, which CNBC has previously reported on, have disrupted the supply of staple foods such as grains and vegetables.

Temperatures in large parts of the country are about 4 to 9 degrees Celsius (7.2 to 16.2 Fahrenheit) above average for this time of the year. The high heat has spoilt large amounts of recently harvested and stored vegetables and is threatening to stop the planting of a fresh batch of crops.

Food prices, which rose an annual 8.7% in both April and May, account for nearly half of the overall consumer price basket. The sharp rise in the cost of food has kept headline inflation above the central bank's target of 4%, preventing it from cutting interest rates.

""The Indian economy remains hostage to intersecting food price shocks,"" Michael Patra, deputy governor of the Reserve Bank of India, said in his statement at the latest monetary policy meeting. ""Food prices are holding back any consideration of possible changes in the monetary policy stance,"" he added.

Keeping rates elevated, though, appears to be ""an unacceptably high growth sacrifice,"" according to Jayanth Varma, another member of the central bank's monetary policy committee, who voted to cut rates. Politically, an economic slowdown is unlikely to bode well for the newly elected BJP-led coalition government.

The anxiety was palpable this week when the government announced limits on traders stockpiling wheat.

""Imposing stock limits was just one option. We have many other tools at our disposal to ensure that wheat prices do not rise abnormally,"" food secretary Sanjeev Chopra told reporters and added that there was no shortage of wheat in the country.

The government also has the option to remove import taxes — currently set at 40% on wheat — to hold prices down.

Yet, Prime Minister Narendra Modi is stuck in a bind if he wants to gain favor with the country's farmers ahead of elections in two large agricultural states scheduled for later this year.

Lowering tariffs would enable grains to be imported from wherever they are cheaper and bring down their cost within India, but it will also undercut profits for local farmers.

For now, the prime minister has instead opted to raise the price the government is willing to pay farmers by 5.4% to about $275 per metric ton of rice. These grains are then redistributed to low-income families at no cost, making it the world's biggest food welfare program.

There are signs that these cost pressures are unlikely to abate soon due to further bad weather. This week, at least 200,000 people have been affected by the floods in India's northeastern region, a key rice-growing area.

But, an elevated inflation and interest rate environment haven't appeared to deter companies or investors.

""You talk to Indian companies, and even with inflation at 6%, they barely bat an eyelid because they're growing at twice that or more,"" said James Thom, lead fund manager of the abrdn New India Investment Trust , which trades like an ETF in London. ""[They] are used to operating with that level of inflation for decades.""

""That's just the norm,"" he added.","A seller is arranging onions at a vegetable market in Nagaon district, in the northeastern state of Assam, India, on February 1, 2024.

The Financial Action Task Force, an international watchdog organization dedicated to combating money laundering and illicit cash flows, on Friday removed Turkey from its ""gray list"" of countries that need special monitoring, handing a major vote of confidence to the country in the midst of its economic turnaround efforts.

""The FATF welcomes Türkiye's significant progress in improving its AML/CFT regime,"" the Paris-based organization wrote in its latest report, using the Turkish government's spelling of its country's name and the acronym for anti-money laundering and combating the financing of terrorism.

It said that Turkey had strengthened the effectiveness of its AML/CFT regime to address ""deficiencies"" that FATF listed in its October 2021 monitoring report.

Those deficiencies included FATF concerns over unregistered money transfer services, insufficient resources dedicated to terrorist financing investigations, alleged involvement in sanctions evasion, lack of oversight on high-risk sectors used for money laundering such as banking and real estate, and insufficient oversight of nonprofit organizations that could be used for terrorist financing, among others.

The FATF in its 2021 report had found sectors like banking, construction and property in Turkey vulnerable to illicit financing of United Nations-sanctioned groups like the Islamic State and al-Qaeda.","As the sunsets, a ferry boat glides across the waters of the Golden Horn with the Suleymaniye Mosque and the city of Istanbul, Turkey in the background.

VettaFi's Todd Rosenbluth thinks value stocks, which have been market laggards, could get a lift from one of the biggest Wall Street events of the year: the FTSE Russell's annual rebalancing.

""It's worth paying attention to value,"" the firm's head of research told CNBC's ""ETF Edge"" this week. ""It feels like … [for a] long time that growth has outperformed value.""

On Friday, the Russell indexes underwent their annual reconstitution to reflect changes in the market as companies grow and shift. The iShares Russell 1000 Growth ETF is up 20% so far this year, while the iShares Russell 1000 Value ETF is up almost 6%.

""We do think there's a place for both growth and value within a broader portfolio — just people are skewed more toward growth heading into the second half of the year,"" he added. ""There have been periods when the pendulum has swung back in favor of value.""

FTSE Russell CEO Fiona Bassett said on ""ETF Edge"" the indices are built to reflect the nature of the market.

""One of the benefits of the Russell franchise generally is our ability to provide different sleeves of exposure,"" she said. ""So, for those people who want to get concentrated exposure to value or to growth, we have the indices available to do that.""

Marco Bello | Reuters

President Joe Biden's raspy, unfocused, often inarticulate and widely panned debate performance stoked deep anxiety among Democrats — and caused some commentators and fundraisers to openly call for a new nominee to run against former President Donald Trump. But replacing Biden as the party's pick less than five months out from Election Day carries enormous political risks and would be difficult, if not impossible, to pull off. Right now, the only likely way Biden could be replaced is if he willingly ends his campaign. And Biden's aides and top Democratic officials say the 81-year-old incumbent has no plans to do so. If he did drop out, Democrats have yet to identify a clear alternative candidate to swap in. But the panic among donors and party officials after watching Biden falter Thursday night in his debate against Trump has led some of them to take steps to get Biden out of the race. There are already discussions among Democratic fundraisers about trying to convince congressional leaders — Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer in particular — to urge Biden to announce to drop out, according to people familiar with the matter who were granted anonymity to speak freely.

Schumer, D-N.Y., is a top target for donors making that pitch because he privately has voiced concerns about Biden's standings in presidential election polls, those people said. Schumer was worried before the debate that Biden and Trump were statistically tied nationally, despite the Republican challenger's conviction in his New York criminal hush money trial. A spokesman for Schumer declined to comment to CNBC but pointed to a social media post the majority leader published after the debate. Schumer in that X post wrote: ""Tonight's debate made the choice clear: Four more years of progress, or four more years of attacks on our fundamental rights and our democracy."" ""We've got to get out the vote for Joe Biden, Kamala Harris, and a Democratic Senate and House!"" the post said. That spin has not alleviated the post-debate anxiety felt by some of the president's top fundraisers. Some of those wealthy donors have lost trust in Biden's team, believing they were given false assurances about Biden's ability to take on Trump. And some of those donors who already planned to attend a high-dollar fundraiser Saturday in the Hamptons section of Long Island say they will attend the event to judge for themselves whether Biden can continue as a viable candidate. ""Democrats are in a very difficult situation because it's late in the campaign for a change,"" said Meena Bose, director of the Peter S. Kalikow Center for the Study of the American Presidency at Hofstra University, in an interview with CNBC. The only feasible way Bose could see it playing out is with Biden throwing his full support behind Vice President Kamala Harris to become the new nominee.

Otherwise, Democrats have a wide-open nomination fight just a few months before the Nov. 5 election, she said. Bose called that a ""disastrous"" prospect."" ""Vice President Harris is a risky choice, but certainly has the visibility and is the logical choice,"" said Bose. ""It's difficult to see how you open up the Democratic presidential nomination now and have a unified path to victory in November,"" she added.

However, even if Biden backed Harris to replace him ahead of the Democratic National Convention in August, there is no guarantee that the delegates he has won so far will shift their support to her. Biden has won nearly all of the roughly 4,000 Democratic-pledged delegates, far exceeding the threshold to make him the party nominee. If Biden refuses to drop out before August, the only opportunity to boot him as nominee would be at the Democratic National Convention that month. It is technically possible that Biden's delegates could abandon him en masse then and throw open the convention to nominate another candidate. Some Democrats who want an alternative to Biden but are concerned about Harris' relatively low opinion polls and rocky campaign history have looked to California Gov. Gavin Newsom, Ohio Sen. Sherrod Brown, Illinois Gov. J.B. Pritzker and others as possible contenders.

But blocking Biden from the nomination is highly improbable, as delegates tend to be strong supporters of their chosen candidate. ""That is probably the worst-case scenario,"" Bose said. ""If the Democrats are going to have a change at the top of the ticket, President Biden has to endorse it and, frankly, probably initiate it."" The DNC rules allow for the party to select another presidential nominee, but only in the ""event of death, resignation or disability"" that leaves the role vacant.

ATTA KENARE | AFP

Iran is voting for its next president Friday in a snap election following the unexpected death of former President Ebrahim Raisi in a helicopter crash — and the outcome could have implications far beyond its borders. While there was no clear frontrunner leading up to the vote, all but one of the six candidates approved to run are conservative hardliners — and half of them have been sanctioned by Western governments. Of the six initial contenders, four remain in the race after two dropped out on Thursday. If there is no clear majority after Friday's vote, the top two candidates face a second round of voting on July 5. The winner will serve for four years — and faces no shortage of challenges. The election comes at a fraught time for the country of 88 million, and turnout is expected to be low. Iranians will go to the polls against the backdrop of a battered economy, widespread popular discontent and harsh crackdowns on dissent. Iran is also dealing with high inflation, heavy Western sanctions, mounting tensions with the U.S., ramped-up Iranian nuclear enrichment and the Israel-Hamas war. Voting is open to roughly 61 million eligible Iranians, but many have pledged to boycott, pointing out the lack of genuine choice for voters. Iran's ultra-conservative Guardian Council controls who is allowed on the ballot and only approved six candidates to run for the presidency, out of a list of 80 registrants.

watch now

Most of the candidates are hardliners who hold staunch anti-Western positions, with just one representing the reformist camp. Women who had registered to run were all disqualified by the Council. Iran's last presidential and parliamentary elections in 2021 and March 2024, respectively, saw the lowest recorded voter turnout in the Islamic Republic's history. Many observers expect that trend to continue. ""In the past, the government has put great emphasis on participation to claim popular legitimacy as a republic ... the decline in turnout over the last several years underscores the public's growing disillusionment with the system,"" Iran analysts Ali Vaez and Naysan Rafat at the think tank Crisis Group wrote in a report. ""Many citizens have come to doubt that they can produce meaningful change through the ballot box,"" they wrote. ""A major reversal of that trend appears unlikely.""

Who is running?

Two candidates appear to be leading the race, according to national polls: Mohammad Bagher Qalibaf and Saeed Jalili, both staunch conservatives. The candidate field features only one reformist candidate, Masoud Pezeshkian. Two of the six initial contenders, Amirhossein Ghazizadeh Hashemi and Alireza Zakani, dropped out of the race on Thursday. Mohammad Bagher Qalibaf: Iran's current speaker of Parliament and a former Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC) commander, Qalibaf also previously served as mayor of Tehran and has already made three attempts at running for the presidency. Saeed Jalili: A former nuclear negotiator, Jalili currently serves as a representative for supreme leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei on the Supreme National Security Council, known to be the most hardline wing of the regime. Jalili is further on the right politically than Qalibaf and a longtime Iranian government insider, but has also had several failed attempts at running for office. Masoud Pezeshkian: The sole reformist candidate in the field, Pezeshkian formerly served as minister of health and has been a parliament member since 2008. He is a member of the Islamic Consultative Assembly and the vice speaker of Parliament, and wants to loosen social restrictions like Iran's strict hijab law and improve relations with the West, including potentially re-starting nuclear talks with world powers. Mostafa Pourmohammadi: The only cleric in the race, Pourmohammadi formerly served as a prosecutor of the Revolutionary Court and deputy minister in Iran's Ministry of Intelligence, working under both conservative and reformist presidencies.

Where the real power lies

Iran's next president will have to contend with whoever takes the White House in November. This raises the stakes for both Tehran and Washington, as well as the Middle East writ large, as Iran comes closer than ever to nuclear bomb-production capability and continues to back proxy groups fighting Israel. On issues of foreign policy and war, the Iranian president wields some influence and is the country's public-facing messenger. But power and critical decision-making in Iran ultimately lies with the supreme leader, Ayatollah Khamenei, and unelected institutions like the Revolutionary Guards.

Nike CEO John Donahoe appears to be on thin ice. The former top executive of eBay , who has been at the helm of Nike since January 2020, is starting to lose Wall Street's confidence after the company capped off a lackluster fiscal year with more bad news. On Thursday, Nike warned that sales in its current quarter were expected to decline by a staggering 10% – far worse than the 3.2% drop LSEG had projected – after it posted its slowest annual sales gain in 14 years, excluding the Covid-19 pandemic. The company also said it expects fiscal 2025 sales to be down mid-single digits when it previously expected them to grow. The warning signs led shares to close 20% lower on Friday -- making it the worst trading day in the company's history since its IPO in Dec. 1980. The plunge wiped about $28 billion off of Nike's market cap, bringing it to just under $114 billion from $142 billion a day earlier. As Wall Street digested the dismal outlook from the world's largest sportswear company, at least six investment banks downgraded Nike's stock. Analysts at Morgan Stanley and Stifel took it a step further, specifically calling the company's management into question. ""The FY25 guide (the 5th downward consensus revision in 6 quarters), pushes prospects for growth inflection further into 2025 (perhaps FY4Q or spring '25 at the earliest) asking investors to both underwrite success of not yet proven styles and look across an uncertain consumer discretionary backdrop into 2HCY24 until momentum could build again into 2HCY25,"" wrote Stifel analyst Jim Duffy. ""Management credibility is severely challenged and potential for C-level regime change adds further uncertainty.""

Since Donahoe took over as Nike's top executive, its stock is down more than 25% as of Friday's close, significantly underperforming both the S&P 500 and the XRT – the retail-focused ETF – which saw gains of around 67% and 66% in that time period, respectively. Nike finance chief Matt Friend on Thursday attributed the guidance cut to a host of factors. Some, like softness in China and challenging foreign exchange headwinds, are outside of Nike's control, but others are problems it squarely created under Donahoe's leadership. The company is expecting wholesale orders to be slow as it scales new styles, pulls back on classic franchises and works to repair its relationships with key retail partners after spending the last few years cutting them off in favor of a direct-selling strategy. At the same time, loyal customers who shop on Nike's website are no longer springing for new pairs of Air Force 1s, Air Jordan 1s or Dunks, the company's core franchises. Critics say the sneaker lines have dominated the retailer's offerings for too long and turned customers away as they sought fresh styles and innovative designs from a slew of upstart competitors. That's left Nike to win back some of its most essential customers – runners. As the retailer focused on its direct-selling strategy at the expense of innovation, scrappy competitors like On Running and Hoka snatched up market share.","In this article NKE Follow your favorite stocks CREATE FREE ACCOUNTJohn Donahoe, attends the first day of the annual Allen & Company Sun Valley Conference, in Sun Valley, Idaho.

CNBC,https://www.cnbc.com/2024/06/28/french-election-le-pens-far-right-national-rally-election-gains.html,2024-06-28,13:48:52 UTC,France's far right looks headed for victory in the first round at the polls. Here's what that means,"Jordan Bardella, President of the National Rally (Rassemblement National), a French nationalist and right-wing populist party, speaks to over 5,000 supporters at his final rally ahead of the upcoming European Parliament election on June 9th, at Le Dôme de Paris - Palais des Sports, on June 2, 2024., France, on June 2, 2024, in Paris, France. Nurphoto | Getty Images

With just days to go until France's snap parliamentary election kicks off, victory for the far right looks increasingly likely in the first phase of the two-stage runoff. Marine Le Pen's National Rally and its allies are seen winning 36% of votes, signaling growing support for the party's euroskeptic, anti-immigration agenda, according to the latest opinion polls from Elabe released ahead of the first vote on June 30. The left-wing New Popular Front, meanwhile, is projected behind with 27%, while President Emmanuel Macron's Renaissance party is predicted to clinch 20% of the support, as of June 27. The shift away from centrist politics has spooked investors and analysts, who warn of implications ranging from ""political paralysis"" to ""immediate financial crisis."" But predicting the outcome of France's final vote on July 7 is less clear cut, given the complexity of France's voting system. CNBC takes a look at the likelihood of a far-right French victory and the impact for markets.

A complex system

Under France's two-stage voting system, all parliamentary candidates who receive at least 12.5% of locally registered voters progress to the second-round runoff — a feat that the National Rally is likely to achieve in a large number of constituencies. But even with sweeping gains in the first round, the party could be stumped at the final hurdle by voters using ""le vote utile"" — or tactical voting — to keep them out. That was seen as part of Macron's gamble when the French leader called the surprise vote following the National Rally's record 31.3% gain in this month's European Parliament elections. Others say the president hopes to discredit his competitors ahead of France's 2027 presidential election, with Macron since claiming there will be ""civil war"" if either extreme wins. Voter turnout for the national election is also expected to be larger — and therefore more representative — than the 51% who cast their ballot in the EU vote. With that in mind, analysts see a 30% to 40% chance of the National Rally winning the 289 seats needed to secure an absolute majority in the 577-seat National Assembly. A more likely outcome, however, would be major gains for the far right, with the National Rally potentially becoming the biggest party in France, but ultimately falling short of a majority and leading to a highly divided hung parliament.

Market turmoil

Such a stalemate could leave France with lower trend growth, elevated yield spreads and a ""worse reputation globally,"" Holger Schmieding, chief economist at Berenberg Bank, told CNBC on Monday. Already, France's blue-chip CAC 40 index is heading for its worst month since May 2023, having lost as much as 6% since the vote was announced on June 9. The spread between French and German borrowing costs — a key indicator of French political risk — has also jumped to its widest in more than a decade. A majority government for either the far-right or the ultra-left alliance, meanwhile, could spark a far more dramatic outcome.

""Spendthrift agendas"" from either party — whose policies both include lowering the retirement age and cutting income tax — could result in an ""immediate financial crisis,"" Schmieding suggested. Citi analysts said in a note Thursday that markets were currently ""too optimistic"" about a benign outcome, adding that its higher probability scenarios of gridlock or an extreme parliament could lead to a 5% to 20% fall in French equity valuations. ""Combined with our finding that French equities tend to be more volatile than peers' around elections, this could be reason to expect additional choppiness from here,"" the analysts noted.

Political paralysis

The CEO of Paris-based Euronext, Europe's biggest stock exchange group, sought to quell investor concerns earlier this week, telling the Financial Times that neither the left nor the right would be able to implement their more extreme policies amid checks and balances from the president, ratings agencies and the European Union. On Monday, Jordan Bardella — Le Pen's 28-year-old protege, who could become prime minister under a strong showing for the National Rally — was seen stepping back on some more extreme measures, vowing to implement ""reasonable"" spending plans. That includes an aim to bring France's deficit back to the EU limit of 3% of GDP. Even with more measured fiscal plans, however, parliamentary gridlock could make such policies difficult to enact. Bardella, for his part, has recently stressed that he would ""need an absolute majority to govern,"" in a bid to boost his backing. ""You start with deficit at 5.5%, debt at 110%, you're unable to do anything for the next three years, which means that deficits are just not coming down. To me that's the biggest issue that France faces right now,"" Jefferies' chief financial economist for Europe, Mohit Kumar, told CNBC's ""Squawk Box Europe"" on Tuesday.","Nurphoto | Getty ImagesWith just days to go until France's snap parliamentary election kicks off, victory for the far right looks increasingly likely in the first phase of the two-stage runoff.

CNBC,https://www.cnbc.com/2024/06/29/ikigai-3-daily-practices-for-a-long-and-happy-life-.html,2024-06-29,19:36:59 UTC,"These 3 daily practices are the Japanese 'secret' for a 'long and happy life,' says authors of 'Ikigai'","Here are a few of the practices that contribute to the longevity and happiness of some of Japan's longest-living people.

The island's age-defying residents caught the attention of authors Héctor García and Francesc Miralles. The pair interviewed over 100 of the oldest people in Okinawa and wrote about the principles and techniques that Japanese centenarians adhere to daily in their book titled Ikigai: The Japanese Secret to a Long and Happy Life .

On average, Okinawan women live longer lives than women from all other areas worldwide, according to longevity expert Dan Buettner . Additionally, ""Okinawans have less cancer, heart disease and dementia than Americans,"" Buettner wrote on his site .

Blue Zones are areas in the world with the most people living the longest lives.

If you, like many others, have ever fallen down a rabbit hole trying to learn more about what causes some people to live longer and feel more happiness, then you've probably already heard of Blue Zones like Okinawa, Japan.

1. Engage in low-intensity movement for at least 5 minutes a day

Just about every super-ager that García and Miralles spoke to shared that they regularly practice radio taiso which is a well-known, decades-old Japanese exercise.

""Even the residents of the nursing home we visited dedicated at least five minutes every day to it, though some did the exercises from their wheelchairs,"" the authors wrote in their book.

It helps that the exercise calls for low-intensity movements and can be completed in five minutes or less. And what makes the practice really stand out is that it's typically done among groups of people.

One of the main goals of radio taiso is to ""promote a spirit of unity among participants,"" according to García and Miralles.

2. Find a purpose and stay busy

There's a Japanese proverb that states: ""Only staying active will make you want to live a hundred years."" Okinawans achieve this by finding their ikigai, or purpose, that encourages them to focus on their deeper meaning in life.

Ikigai can be loosely translated to ""the happiness of always being busy."" Often, people who live the longest don't retire.

For example, Hayao Miyazaki, 83, is the director of animated films at Studio Ghibli in Japan. A day after retiring in the 90s, Miyazaki came to work to sketch new animations; he just released a movie in 2023.

3. Achieving a state of flow

""There is no magic recipe for finding happiness, for living according to your ikigai,"" García and Miralles wrote in their book. ""But one key ingredient is the ability to reach this state of flow and, through this state, to have an 'optimal experience.'""

Flow is a concept used to describe being fully engaged in an action, and it was coined by psychologist Mihaly Csikszentmihalyi.

Being engulfed in a state of flow allows you to be more present, improve your focus and temporarily forget about your worries, according to García and Miralles.

""The happiest people are not the ones who achieve the most,"" they wrote. ""They are the one who spend more time than others in a state of flow.""

Amazon is ramping up its development of artificial intelligence technology, hiring top talent from AI agent startup Adept and licensing the company's technology.

Rohit Prasad, a senior vice president and head scientist who oversees Amazon's artificial general intelligence unit, wrote in a memo to employees on Friday that the company hired Adept co-founder and CEO David Luan and ""a few other deeply talented team members to our AGI team.""

Luan will oversee Amazon's ""AGI Autonomy"" division, and report to Prasad, he wrote in the memo, which CNBC obtained. Amazon confirmed the contents of the memo. Geekwire was first to report on it.

Amazon faces fierce competition in AI, as rivals Microsoft and Google rapidly add new features into their core products while also giving businesses more ways to access large language models in their public cloud offerings. Amazon's cloud unit has launched a range of AI services, including its own models, which are generally viewed as lagging behind the top competitors.

Amazon has also pumped billions of dollars into OpenAI competitor Anthropic, and it's planning to overhaul its Alexa voice assistant with a new paid version that has generative AI capabilities. Prasad, who previously served as a head scientist for Alexa, was tapped in August to steer Amazon's development of AGI, or software that's significantly more advanced than current AI and starts to approach human-level capabilities.

Last month, Amazon announced Adam Selipsky, the head of Amazon Web Services, would be stepping down and succeeded by Matt Garman, the head of sales at marketing at AWS.","The front desk of the Amazon office is pictured in New York, May 1, 2019.

JPMorgan Chase and Morgan Stanley said Friday that they were boosting both dividend payouts and share repurchases, while rivals Citigroup and Bank of America made more modest announcements.

JPMorgan, the biggest U.S. bank by assets, said it was raising its quarterly dividend 8.7% to $1.25 per share and that it authorized a new $30 billion share repurchase program.

Morgan Stanley, a dominant player in wealth management, said it was boosting its dividend 8.8% to 92.5 cents per share and authorized a $20 billion repurchase plan.

Citigroup said it was raising its dividend 5.7% to 56 cents per share and that it would ""continue to assess share repurchases"" on a quarterly basis.

Bank of America said it was increasing its dividend 8% to 26 cents per share. Its release made no mention of share repurchases.

The big banks announced their plans to boost capital return to shareholders after passing the annual stress test administered by the Federal Reserve this week. While all 31 banks in this year's exam showed regulators they could withstand a severe hypothetical recession, JPMorgan said Wednesday that it could have higher losses than the Fed initially found.

Still, that would not affect its capital-return plan, the New York-based bank said Friday.

""The strength of our company allows us to continually invest in building our businesses for the future, pay a sustainable dividend, and return any remaining excess capital to our shareholders as we see fit,"" JPMorgan CEO Jamie Dimon said in his company's release.

CNBC,https://www.cnbc.com/2024/06/28/may-pce-inflation-report.html,2024-06-28,19:35:23 UTC,"Key Fed measure shows inflation rose 2.6% in May from a year ago, as expected","Including food and energy, headline inflation was flat on the month and also up 2.6% on an annual basis. Those readings also were in line with expectations.

Both numbers were in line with the Dow Jones estimates. May marked the lowest annual rate since March 2021, which was the first time in this economic cycle that inflation topped the Fed's 2% target.

The core personal consumption expenditures price index increased just a seasonally adjusted 0.1% for the month and was up 2.6% from a year ago, the latter number down 0.2 percentage point from the April level, according to a Commerce Department report .

An important economic measure for the Federal Reserve showed Friday that inflation during May slowed to its lowest annual rate in more than three years.

""It is just additional news that monetary policy is working, inflation is gradually cooling,"" San Francisco Fed President Mary Daly told CNBC's Andrew Ross Sorkin during a ""Squawk Box"" interview. ""That's a relief for businesses and households who've been struggling with persistently high inflation. It's good news for how policy is working.""

The Fed focuses on the PCE inflation reading as opposed to the more widely followed consumer price index from the Labor Department's Bureau of Labor Statistics. PCE is a broader inflation measure and accounts for changes in consumer behavior, such as substituting their purchases when prices rise.

While the central bank officially follows headline PCE, officials generally stress the core reading as a better gauge of longer-term inflation trends.

Outside of the inflation numbers, the Bureau of Economic Analysis report showed that personal income rose 0.5% on the month, stronger than the 0.4% estimate. Consumer spending, however, increased 0.2%, weaker than the 0.3% forecast.

Prices were held in check during the month by a 0.4% decline for goods and a 2.1% slide in energy, which offset a 0.2% increase in services and a 0.1% gain for food.

However, housing prices continued to rise, up 0.4% on the month for the fourth straight time. Shelter-related costs have proven stickier than Federal Reserve officials have anticipated and have helped keep the central bank from reducing interest rates as expected this year.

Stock market futures were modestly positive following the report while Treasury yields were negative on the session.

Investors have been trying to handicap the Fed's intentions on rates this year and have had to scale back expectations. Whereas traders earlier in 2024 had been expecting at least six rate cuts this year they are now pricing in just two, starting in September. Fed officials at their June meeting penciled in just one reduction this year.

""The lack of surprise in today's PCE number is a relief and will be welcomed by the Fed,"" said Seema Shah, chief global strategist at Principal Asset Management. ""However, the policy path is not yet certain. A further deceleration in inflation, ideally coupled with additional evidence of labor market softening, will be necessary to pave the way for a first rate cut in September.""

The Fed targets 2% inflation and began raising interest rates in March 2022 after a year of dismissing rising prices as transitory effects from the Covid pandemic that likely would fade. The central bank last raised rates in July 2023 after taking its benchmark overnight borrowing level to a range of 5.25%-5.50%, the highest in some 23 years.

Recent economic data has painted a picture of an economy that has withstood the Fed's aggressive monetary tightening. Gross domestic product rose at a 1.4% annualized rate in the first quarter and is on pace to increase 2.2% in the second quarter, according to the Atlanta Fed.

There have been some slight cracks in the labor market lately, with continuing jobless claims hitting their highest level since November 2021. However, the unemployment rate is still 4%, low by historical means though also rising at a slow pace.","Including food and energy, headline inflation was flat on the month and also up 2.6% on an annual basis.

Warren Buffett on Friday made his biggest annual donation to date, giving $5.3 billion worth of Berkshire Hathaway shares to five charities.

The legendary investor, who's turning 94 in August, converted 8,674 of his Berkshire Class A shares to donate more than 13 million Class B shares, according to a statement Friday. A total of 9.93 million shares went to the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation, with the rest going to the Susan Thompson Buffett Foundation, named for his late first wife, and the three charities led by his children Howard, Susan and Peter Buffett.

The ""Oracle of Omaha"" has pledged to give away the fortune he built at Berkshire, the Omaha, Nebraska-based conglomerate he started running in 1965. Buffett has been making annual donations to the five charities since 2006.

After Friday's donations, Buffett owns 207,963 Berkshire A shares and 2,586 B shares, worth about $130 billion.

New charitable trust

In an interview with The Wall Street Journal, Buffett clarified that after his death, the enormous fortune he amassed from building the one-of-a-kind conglomerate will be directed to a new charitable trust overseen by his three children.

""It should be used to help the people that haven't been as lucky as we have been,"" he told the Journal. ""There's eight billion people in the world, and me and my kids, we've been in the luckiest 100th of 1% or something. There's lots of ways to help people.""

Buffett has previously said his three children are the executors of his will as well as the named trustees of the charitable trust that will receive 99%-plus of his wealth.

He told the Journal that the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation will no longer receive donations after his death. Buffett resigned as a trustee at the Gates Foundation in June 2021 in the midst of Bill and Melinda Gates' divorce.

At Berkshire's annual meeting in May, Buffett spoke candidly to shareholders about a future when he's no longer at the helm, appearing solemn at times as he pondered his advanced age and reflected on his late friend and business partner Charlie Munger.

Greg Abel, vice chairman for noninsurance operations at Berkshire, has been named Buffett's successor and has taken on most of the responsibility at the conglomerate.

Buffett previously said his will will be made public after his death.

""After my death, the disposition of my assets will be an open book – no 'imaginative' trusts or foreign entities to avoid public scrutiny but rather a simple will available for inspection at the Douglas County Courthouse,"" Buffett said in November.","Warren Buffett speaks during the Berkshire Hathaway Annual Shareholders Meeting in Omaha, Nebraska on May 4, 2024.

CNBC,https://www.cnbc.com/2024/06/27/imf-says-fed-should-hold-interest-rates-until-at-least-end-of-year.html,2024-06-27,20:28:43 UTC,IMF says Fed should hold interest rates where they are until 'at least' end of year,"The Federal Reserve should wait to cut interest rates until ""at least"" the end of the year, according to the head of the International Monetary Fund. The U.S. is the only G20 economy to see growth above pre-pandemic levels, and ""robust"" growth indicates ongoing upside risks to inflation, the 190-country agency said.

""We do recognize important upside risks,"" IMF Managing Director Kristalina Georgieva said at a press briefing on Thursday. ""Given those risks, we agree that the Fed should keep policy rates at current levels until at least late 2024."" The Fed's current fed funds rate has stood within the range of 5.25% to 5.50% since July 2023.

The IMF, often called the world's ""lender of last resort,"" forecasts that the core personal consumption expenditures price index — the Fed's preferred measure of inflation — will end 2024 at around 2.5% and reach the Fed's 2% target rate by mid-2025, ahead of the Fed's own projection for 2026.

U.S. economic strength during the Fed's rate-hike cycle was aided by labor supply and productivity gains, Georgieva said, while highlighting the need for ""clear evidence"" that inflation is coming down to the 2% target before the Fed cuts rates.

Nonetheless, the IMF's ""more optimistic"" assessment of the downward inflation trajectory is based on indications of a cooling labor market in the U.S. and weakening consumer demand.

""I want to recognize that a lesson we learned from the last [few] years is we are at a time of more uncertainty. This uncertainty also lies ahead. We are confident, however, that the Fed will move through that, and certainly with the same prudence it has demonstrated over the last year,"" Georgieva said.

Correction: A previous version of this article misstated Kristalina Georgieva's name.","The Federal Reserve should wait to cut interest rates until ""at least"" the end of the year, according to the head of the International Monetary Fund.
The U.S. is the only G20 economy to see growth above pre-pandemic levels, and ""robust"" growth indicates ongoing upside risks to inflation, the 190-country agency said.
""We do recognize important upside risks,"" IMF Managing Director Kristalina Georgieva said at a press briefing on Thursday.
""Given those risks, we agree that the Fed should keep policy rates at current levels until at least late 2024.""

Roaring Kitty, whose legal name is Keith Gill, has stirred up trading in speculative names such as GameStop by posting cryptic images and memes online. A picture of a cartoon dog appeared on his X feed Thursday afternoon, briefly driving up Chewy shares as much as 34% to $39.10. The stock later fell into negative territory again in Thursday's session, closing the day down 0.3%.

Chewy shares rallied dramatically on Thursday after meme stock leader Roaring Kitty posted a picture on social media platform X that resembles the logo of the online pet food retailer, but the gains were quickly erased later in the session.

There's also a strong connection between meme stock GameStop and Chewy. GameStop CEO Ryan Cohen was the founder and CEO of Chewy, who was instrumental in PetSmart's takeover of Chewy in 2017 and its subsequent initial public offering in 2019.

Cohen joined the GameStop board of directors along with two other Chewy executives in January 2021, partly helping fuel the initial GameStop rally. He later took over as GameStop CEO in 2023, leading a turnaround in the brick-and-mortar video game retailer.

Shares in pet retailers such as Chewy and Petco saw big spikes during the pandemic when stuck-at-home consumers adopted cats and dogs in droves. With the adoptions came purchases of needed accessories such as new beds and leashes for their furry family members.

But as the pandemic ended and people began venturing outside again, adoption numbers slowed and consumers had less need for discretionary pet items such as toys and cages, which carry higher profit margins than pet food.

Over the past year or so, Chewy and Petco have seen consistently strong pet food sales, but revenue for higher margin categories has fallen.

Gill is a former marketer for Massachusetts Mutual Life Insurance. He came into the limelight after successfully encouraging retail investors to buy GameStop shares and call options in 2021 to squeeze out short-selling hedge funds. The mania in 2021 led to a series of congressional hearings featuring Gill in brokers' practices and the ""gamification"" of retail trading.","A picture of a cartoon dog appeared on his X feed Thursday afternoon, briefly driving up Chewy shares as much as 34% to $39.10.

CNBC,https://www.cnbc.com/2024/06/27/jpmorgan-chase-fed-stress-test-results-error.html,2024-06-27,14:34:23 UTC,JPMorgan Chase says its stress test losses should be higher than what the Fed disclosed,"JPMorgan Chase CEO and Chairman Jamie Dimon gestures as he speaks during the U.S. Senate Banking, Housing and Urban Affairs Committee oversight hearing on Wall Street firms, on Capitol Hill in Washington, D.C.

JPMorgan Chase said late Wednesday that the Federal Reserve overestimated a key measure of income in the giant bank's recent stress test, and that its losses under the exam should actually be higher than what the regulator found.

The bank took the unusual step of issuing a press release minutes before midnight ET to disclose its response to the Fed's findings.

JPMorgan said that the Fed's projections for a measure called ""other comprehensive income"" — which represents revenues, expenses and losses that are excluded from net income — ""appears to be too large.""

Under the Fed's table of projected revenue, income and losses though 2026, JPMorgan was assigned $13 billion in OCI, more than any of the 31 lenders in this year's test. It also estimated that the bank would face roughly $107 billion in loan, investment and trading losses in that scenario.

""Should the Firm's analysis be correct, the resulting stress losses would be modestly higher than those disclosed by the Federal Reserve,"" the bank said.

The error means that JPMorgan might require more time to finalize its share repurchase plan, according to a person with knowledge of the situation who declined to be identified speaking about the regulatory process. Banks were expected to begin disclosing those plans on Friday after the market closes.

The news is a wrinkle to the Federal Reserve's announcement Wednesday that all 31 of the banks in the annual exercise cleared the hurdle of being able to withstand a severe hypothetical recession, while maintaining adequate capital levels and the ability to lend to consumers and corporations.

Last year, Bank of America and Citigroup made similar disclosures, saying that estimates of their own future income differed from the Fed's results.

Banks have complained that aspects of the annual exam are opaque and that it's difficult to understand how the Fed produces some of its results.","The bank took the unusual step of issuing a press release minutes before midnight ET to disclose its response to the Fed's findings.

CNBC,https://www.cnbc.com/2024/06/26/fed-banks-stress-test-2024.html,2024-06-26,21:26:37 UTC,Federal Reserve says all 31 banks in annual stress test withstood a severe hypothetical downturn,"Federal Reserve Board Vice Chair for Supervision Michael Barr testifies before a House Financial Services Committee hearing on the response to the bank failures of Silicon Valley Bank and Signature Bank, on Capitol Hill in Washington, D.C., on March 29, 2023.

The Federal Reserve said Wednesday that the biggest banks operating in the U.S. would be able to withstand a severe recession scenario while maintaining their ability to lend to consumers and corporations.

Each of the 31 banks in this year's regulatory exercise cleared the hurdle of being able to absorb losses while maintaining more than the minimum required capital levels, the Fed said in a statement.

The stress test assumed that unemployment surges to 10%, commercial real estate values plunge 40% and housing prices fall 36%.

""This year's results show that under our stress scenario, large banks would take nearly $685 billion in total hypothetical losses, yet still have considerably more capital than their minimum common equity requirements,"" said Michael Barr, the Fed's vice chair for supervision. ""This is good news and underscores the usefulness of the extra capital that banks have built in recent years.""

The Fed's stress test is an annual ritual that forces banks to maintain adequate cushions for bad loans and dictates the size of share repurchases and dividends. This year's version included giants such as JPMorgan Chase and Goldman Sachs , credit card companies including American Express and regional lenders such as Truist .

While no bank appeared to get badly tripped up by this year's exercise, which had roughly the same assumptions as the 2023 test, the group's aggregate capital levels fell 2.8 percentage points, which was worse than last year's decline.

That is because the industry is holding more consumer credit card loans and more corporate bonds that have been downgraded. Lending margins have also been squeezed compared to last year, according to the Fed.

""While banks are well-positioned to withstand the specific hypothetical recession we tested them against, the stress test also confirmed that there are some areas to watch,"" Barr said. ""The financial system and its risks are always evolving, and we learned in the Great Recession the cost of failing to acknowledge shifting risks.""

The Fed also performed what it called an ""exploratory analysis"" of funding stresses and a trading meltdown that applied to only the eight biggest banks.

In this exercise, the companies appeared to avoid disaster, despite a sudden surge in the cost of deposits combined with a recession. In a scenario where five large hedge funds implode, the big banks would lose between $70 billion and $85 billion.

""The results demonstrated that these banks have material exposure to hedge funds but that they can withstand different types of trading book shocks,"" the Fed said.

Morgan Stanley is pushing further into its adoption of artificial intelligence with a new assistant that is expected to take over thousands of hours of labor for the bank's financial advisors. The assistant, called Debrief, keeps detailed logs of advisors' meetings and automatically creates draft emails and summaries of the discussions, bank executives told CNBC. Morgan Stanley plans to release the program to the firm's roughly 15,000 advisors by early July, marking one of the most significant steps yet for the use of generative AI at a major Wall Street bank. While the company's earlier efforts involved creating a ChatGPT-like service to help advisors navigate the firm's reams of research, Debrief brings AI into direct contact with advisors' most prized resource: their relationships with rich clients. The program, built using OpenAI's GPT-4, essentially sits in on client Zoom meetings, replacing the note-taking that advisors or junior employees have been doing by hand, according to Jeff McMillan, Morgan Stanley's head of firmwide artificial intelligence. ""What we're finding is that the quality and depth of the notes are just significantly better,"" McMillan told CNBC. ""The truth is, this does a better job of taking notes than the average human.""

Consent required

Importantly, clients must consent to being recorded each time Debrief is used. Future versions will allow advisors to use the program on corporate devices during in-person meetings, said McMillan. The rollout will serve as a real-world test for the vaunted productivity gains of generative AI, which took Wall Street by storm in recent months and has bolstered the value of chipmakers, tech giants and the broader U.S. stock market. Morgan Stanley's wealth management division hosts about 1 million Zoom calls a year, the bank told CNBC. While estimates vary, one Morgan Stanley advisor involved in the Debrief pilot said the program saves 30 minutes of work per meeting; advisors typically spend time after meetings creating notes and action plans to address client needs.

""As a financial adviser I'm doing four, five or six meetings a day,"" said Don Whitehead, a Houston-based advisor who's been testing the software. By ""having the note-taking service built in through AI, you can really be invested in the meeting, you're actually a lot more present."" It remains to be seen what advisors will do with the hours reclaimed from essential grunt work. In a sense, Morgan Stanley's projects in generative AI amount to a ""grand experiment in productivity,"" said McMillan. If, as McMillan and others believe, advisors will spend more time serving clients and prospecting for new ones, the technology should boost Morgan Stanley's growth in assets under management, as well as retention of clients and advisors. Morgan Stanley's wealth management division is one of the world's largest with $5.5 trillion in client assets as of March; the firm wants to reach $10 trillion. It will take at least a year to determine whether the technology is boosting advisor productivity, McMillan said. ""I'm the analytics guy, but the advisors will tell you that they're at their best when they're engaging"" with clients, said McMillan. ""None of them will tell you they love taking notes or looking at research reports, right? That's not why they got into this business.""

""I believe the governments [of China and the European Union] are now considering how, through negotiations, they can combine investment together with commodity trade,"" said Wan Gang, now president of the China Association for Science and Technology.

Wan was speaking via an official English translation during a livestream of a panel at the World Economic Forum's ""Summer Davos"" meeting in Dalian, China. Spokespersons for the European Commission were not immediately available when contacted by CNBC.

Regarding specifics, China's Ministry of Foreign Affairs referred CNBC to the Chinese authorities ""in charge,"" according to a CNBC translation of the Chinese. The ministry said China and the EU are each other's most important trade and investment partners, and that China hoped the EU would keep its trade and investment markets open.

China's Ministry of Commerce did not immediately respond to a request for comment outside of business hours on Thursday. The Commerce Ministry's spokesperson told reporters earlier in the day that the Chinese and European working groups remain in close consultations.

The Commerce Ministry had said over the weekend that it was launching consultations with the EU over the bloc's probe into the role of subsidies in Chinese electric cars. The EU said earlier this month that it would increase tariffs on imports of the vehicles.

""Even though we are not exporting a large number of EVs, perhaps the Chinese companies can try investing in Europe,"" Wan said, noting that such funding could create local jobs.","HEFEI, China — The man who spearheaded China's electric car strategy said Wednesday that Chinese investment in the European electric vehicles industry could be a way forward for both sides amid trade tensions.

CNBC,https://www.cnbc.com/2024/06/26/your-401k-is-up-but-a-new-report-says-americans-need-to-save-more-.html,2024-06-26,11:00:06 UTC,"Your 401(k) is up, and a new report shows increased savings. But Americans need to do more","How's your 401(k) looking? A new report shows Americans are saving more, but probably need to do even more.

Vanguard has released its annual report, How America Saves 2024. Vanguard and Fidelity are the two biggest sponsors of 401(k) plans, and this is a snapshot of what nearly five million participants are doing with their money.

The good news: stock market returns are up and, thanks largely to automatic enrollment plans, investors are saving more than they did in the past.

The bad news: account balances for the median 401(k) of a person approaching retirement (65+) remains very low.

The takeaway: Americans are still very reliant on Social Security for a large chunk of their retirement.

Higher returns, participation rates, savings rates

Why do we care so much about 401(k) plans? Because it's the main private savings vehicle Americans have for retirement. More than 100 million Americans are covered by these ""defined contribution"" plans, with more than $10 trillion in assets.

First, 2023 was a good year to be an investor. The average total return rate for participants was 18.1%, the best year since 2019.

But to be effective vehicles for retirement, these plans need to: 1) have high participation rates, and 2) hold high levels of savings.

On those fronts, there is good news. John James, managing director of Vanguard's Institutional Investor Group, called it ""a year of progress.""

Plan participation reached all-time highs. Thanks to a change in the law several years ago, a record-high 59% of plans offered automatic enrollment in 401(k) plans. This is a major improvement: ipreviously, enrollment in 401(k) plans were often short of expectations because investors had to ""opt-in,"" that is they had to choose to participate in the plan. Because of indecision or simple ignorance, many did not. By switching to automatic enrollment, participants were automatically enrolled and had to ""opt-out"" if they did not want to participate.

The result: enrollment rates have gone up. Plans with automatic enrollment had a 94% participation rate, compared with 67% for voluntary enrollment plans.

Participant saving rates reached all time highs. The average participant deferred 7.4% of their savings. Including employee and employer contributions, the average total participant contribution rate was 11.7%.

A few other observations about Vanguard's 401(k) plan investors:

They prefer equities and target date funds. They love equities over bonds or any other investments. The average plan contribution to equities is 74%. A record-high 64% of all 2023 contributions went into target-date funds, which automatically adjust stock and bond allocations as the participant ages.

They don't trade much. In 2023, only 5% of nonadvised participants traded within their accounts; 95% did no trading at all. ""Over the past 15 years, we have generally observed a decline in participant trading,"" Vanguard said, which it partially attributed to increased adoption of target-date funds.

Despite gains in the market, account balances are still low

In 2023, the average account balance for Vanguard participants was $134,128, but the median balance (half had more, half had less) was only $35,286.

Why such a big difference between the average and the median? Because a small group of investors with large balances pull up the averages. Forty percent of participants had less than $20,000 in their retirement accounts.

Distribution of account balances

Less than $20,000 40%

$20,000-$99,999 30%

$100,000-$249,900 15%

$250,000 + 15%

Median balances for those near retirement are still low

A different way to look at the problem is to ask how much people who are retirement age have saved, because it's an indication of how prepared they are for imminent retirement.

Investors 65 years or older had an average account balance of $272,588, but a median balance of only $88,488.

A median balance of $88,488 is not much when you consider older participants have higher incomes and higher savings rates. That is not much money for a 65-year old nearing retirement.

Of course, these balances don't necessarily reflect total lifetime savings. Some have more than one retirement plan because they had other plans with previous employers. Most do have other sources of retirement savings, typically Social Security. A shrinking number may also have a pension. Some may have money in checking accounts, or have stocks or bonds outside a retirement account.

Regardless, the math does not look great

So let's do some retirement math.

A typical annual drawdown for a 401(k) account in retirement is about 4%. Drawing down 4% of $88,488 a year gets you $3,539 every 12 months.

Next, Social Security. As of January 2023, the average Social Security benefit was almost $1,689 per month, or about $20,268 per year.

Finally, even though pensions are a vanishing benefit, let's include them.

According to the Pension Rights Center, the median annual pension benefit for a private pension is $9,262 (government employees have higher benefits).

Here's our yearly retirement budget:

Personal savings $3,539

Pension $9,262

Social Security $20,264

Total: $33,065

It's certainly possibly to live on $33,000 a year, but this would likely only work if you own your home, have low expenses and live in a low-cost part of the country.

Even then, it would hardly be a robust retirement.

And these are the lucky ones. Only 57% of retirees have a tax-deferred retirement account like a 401(k) or IRA. Only 56% reported receiving income from a pension.

And that extra income largely determines whether a retiree feels good or bad about their retirement.

In 2023, four out five retirees said they were doing at least okay financially, but this varied tremendously depending on whether retirees had sources of income outside of Social Security. Only 52% of retirees who did not have private income said they were doing at least okay financially.

What can be done?

To have a more robust retirement, Americans are just going to have to save more.

One issue is investors still don't contribute the maximum amount allowed. Only 14% of participants saved the statutory maximum amount of $22,500 per year ($30,000 for those age 50 or older). The likely reason: most felt they couldn't afford to.

However, only 53% of even those with income over $150,000 contributed the maximum allowed. Given that the employee match is ""free money,"" one would think participants in that income bracket would rationally choose to max out their contribution. The fact that many still don't suggests that more investor education is needed.

Regardless, it's very dangerous to assume that retirees are going to be bailed out by an ever-rising stock market. Another year anywhere near 2022, when the S&P 500 was down 20%, and investor confidence in their financial future will likely deteriorate.","The bad news: account balances for the median 401(k) of a person approaching retirement (65+) remains very low.
Higher returns, participation rates, savings ratesWhy do we care so much about 401(k) plans?
Thanks to a change in the law several years ago, a record-high 59% of plans offered automatic enrollment in 401(k) plans.
By switching to automatic enrollment, participants were automatically enrolled and had to ""opt-out"" if they did not want to participate.
Plans with automatic enrollment had a 94% participation rate, compared with 67% for voluntary enrollment plans.","['increased', 'retirement', 'average', 'security', 'report', 'median', 'plans', 'account', 'need', 'savings', 'americans', '401k', 'enrollment', 'participants', 'shows']",https://image.cnbcfm.com/api/v1/image/107394952-1711983439819-gettyimages-1810936589-hhhelderlymanecolifegetty2023hhh053.jpeg?v=1719354297&w=1920&h=1080,False,how k look new report show american save more probabl need even more vanguard releas annual report america save vanguard fidel two biggest sponsor k plan snapshot near five million particip money good news stock market return and thank larg automat enrol plan investor save past bad news account balanc median k person approach retir remain low takeaway american still reliant social secur larg chunk retir higher return particip rate save rate care much k plan main privat save vehicl american retir million american cover defin contribut plan trillion asset first good year investor averag total return rate particip best year sinc effect vehicl retir plan need to high particip rate hold high level save front good news john jame manag director vanguard institut investor group call a year progress plan particip reach alltim high thank chang law sever year ago recordhigh plan offer automat enrol k plan major improv iprevi enrol k plan often short expect investor optin choos particip plan indecis simpl ignor mani not switch automat enrol particip automat enrol optout want particip result enrol rate gone up plan automat enrol particip rate compar voluntari enrol plan particip save rate reach time high averag particip defer save includ employe employ contribut averag total particip contribut rate observ vanguard k plan investor prefer equiti target date fund love equiti bond invest averag plan contribut equiti recordhigh contribut went targetd fund automat adjust stock bond alloc particip age trade much nonadvis particip trade within account trade all over past year general observ declin particip trade vanguard said partial attribut increas adopt targetd fund despit gain market account balanc still low averag account balanc vanguard particip median balanc half more half less big differ averag median small group investor larg balanc pull averag forti percent particip less retir account distribut account balanc less sourc vanguard median balanc near retir still low differ way look problem ask much peopl retir age save indic prepar immin retir investor year older averag account balanc median balanc median balanc much consid older particip higher incom higher save rate much money year old near retir cours balanc necessarili reflect total lifetim save one retir plan plan previous employ sourc retir save typic social secur shrink number may also pension may money check account stock bond outsid retir account regardless math look great let retir math typic annual drawdown k account retir draw year get everi month next social secur januari averag social secur benefit almost per month per year final even though pension vanish benefit let includ them accord pension right center median annual pension benefit privat pension govern employe higher benefit here year retir budget person save pension social secur total certain possibl live year would like work home low expens live lowcost part countri even then would hard robust retir lucki one retire taxdef retir account like k ira report receiv incom pension extra incom larg determin whether retire feel good bad retir four five retire said least okay financi vari tremend depend whether retire sourc incom outsid social secur retire privat incom said least okay financi done robust retir american go save more one issu investor still contribut maximum amount allow particip save statutori maximum amount per year age older like reason felt afford to howev even incom contribut maximum allow given employe match free money one would think particip incom bracket would ration choos max contribut fact mani still suggest investor educ need regardless danger assum retire go bail everris stock market anoth year anywher near sp investor confid financi futur like deterior

Patrick Van Katwijk | Getty Images

AMSTERDAM — Europe is at risk of falling behind the U.S. and China on artificial intelligence as it focuses on regulating the technology, according to Prince Constantijn of the Netherlands. ""Our ambition seems to be limited to being good regulators,"" Constantijn told CNBC in an interview on the sidelines of the Money 20/20 fintech conference in Amsterdam earlier this month. Prince Constantijn is the third and youngest son of former Dutch Queen Beatrix and the younger brother of reigning Dutch King Willem-Alexander. He is special envoy of the Dutch startup accelerator Techleap, where he works to help local startups grow fast internationally by improving their access to capital, market, talent, and technologies. ""We've seen this in the data space [with GDPR], we've seen this now in the platform space, and now with the AI space,"" Constantijn added. European Union regulators have taken a tough approach to artificial intelligence, with formal regulations limiting how developers and companies can apply the technology in certain scenarios.

The bloc gave final approval to the EU AI Act, a ground-breaking AI law, last month. Officials are concerned by how quickly the technology is advancing and risks it poses around jobs displacement, privacy, and algorithmic bias. The law takes a risk-based approach to artificial intelligence, meaning that different applications of the tech are treated differently depending on their risk level. For generative AI applications, the EU AI Act sets out clear transparency requirements and copyright rules. All generative AI systems would have to make it possible to prevent illegal output, to disclose if content is produced by AI and to publish summaries of the copyrighted data used for training purposes. But the EU's Ai Act requires even stricter scrutiny for high-impact, general-purpose AI models that could pose ""systemic risk,"" such as OpenAI's GPT-4 — including thorough evaluations and compulsory reporting of any ""serious incidents."" Prince Constantijn said he's ""really concerned"" that the Europe's focus has been more on regulating AI than trying to become a leader innovating in the space. ""It's good to have guardrails. We want to bring clarity to the market, predictability and all that,"" he told CNBC earlier this month on the sidelines of Money 20/20. ""But it's very hard to do that in such a fast-moving space."" ""There are big risks in getting it wrong, and like we've seen in genetically modified organisms, it hasn't stopped the development. It just stopped Europe developing it, and now we are consumers of the product, rather than producers able to influence the market as it develops."" Between 1994 and 2004, the EU had imposed an effective moratorium on new approvals of genetically modified crops over perceived health risks associated with them.

The bloc subsequently developed strict rules for GMOs, citing a need to protect citizens' health and the environment. The U.S. National Academies of Sciences says that genetically modified crops are safe for both human consumption and the environment. Constantijn added that Europe is making it ""quite hard"" for itself to innovate in AI due to ""big restrictions on data,"" particularly when it comes to sectors like health and medical science. In addition, the U.S. market is ""a much bigger and unified market"" with more free-flowing capital, Constantijn said. On these points he added, ""Europe scores quite poorly."" ""Where we score well is, I think, on talent,"" he said. ""We score well on technology itself."" Plus, when it comes to developing applications that use AI, ""Europe is definitely going to be competitive,"" Constantijn noted. He nevertheless added that ""the underlying data infrastructure and IT infrastructure is something we'll keep depending on large platforms to provide.""","Prince Constantijn is special envoy to Techleap, a Dutch startup accelerator.

DALIAN, China — For China's yuan to be used more globally, the currency needs more ""applications"" such as for stocks and bonds, Bonnie Chan, CEO of Hong Kong Exchanges and Clearing Limited, said on a panel Tuesday. Beijing has long touted its ambitions for increasing global use of the Chinese yuan — also known as the ""renminbi"" or ""RMB"" — in an international financial market where the U.S. dollar is the dominant currency. U.S. sanctions on Russia have also increased the pressure on some countries to have alternatives to the greenback. Chan, speaking during the World Economic Forum's ""Summer Davos"" meeting in Dalian, China, noted that people hold a currency for trade, or, more importantly, as a store of wealth. ""We're not just going to hold on to a bunch of RMB and put it into this bank account,"" she said. ""You want to have bonds, you want to have equities, etc."" ""One of our strategic imperatives [has] been changed to make sure that we continue to produce more RMB-denominated security products,"" Chan said, ""so that investors around the world can actually see more applications of the RMB and be able to use those as the medium to store wealth in the form of the RMB.""

Last year, the HKEX announced a ""Dual-Counter"" program that allows investors to trade Hong Kong-listed securities in Hong Kong dollars or Chinese yuan. In a significant step toward internationalization of the yuan, the International Monetary Fund in 2015 announced that it would add the yuan to its basket of reserve currencies the following year. The yuan was the fourth-most active currency for global payments by value in May, accounting for nearly 4.5% of such transactions, according to the interbank messaging network SWIFT. The U.S. dollar had a nearly 48% share. In trade finance, the yuan ranked third at about 5.1% in May, according to SWIFT. The euro was slightly higher at 5.6%, while the U.S. dollar dominated with a nearly 85% share, the data showed. Fred Hu, founder, chairman and CEO of Primavera Capital, said on the same panel Tuesday that the internationalization of the yuan is probably going to take longer than many expect, despite an increased amount of statements from Beijing. While China is the largest trading nation and has large financial centers, ""we're not as big, as deep as the U.S.,"" Hu said. ""Besides our capital account is also closed, it's not fully convertible, [which] also in some way [is] hampering the internationalization of the renminbi.""

A maturing financial market

Developing more Chinese yuan-denominated investment products also requires a maturation of the local financial sector. Part of that includes having a more sophisticated investor base. Chan said that during the annual Lujiazui Financial Forum in Shanghai last week, nearly every conversation with top leaders included the term ""patient investing."" The phrase has emerged in official releases to encourage long-term investing over short-term speculation. ""Patience comes from learning through the market volatility,"" Kenny Lam, CEO of Two Sigma Asia-Pacific, said during the same panel on Tuesday. He said that policymakers have been giving more thought to making their policies more stable and consistent.

Why life insurance purchases have 'steadily' fallen

Many Americans fail to plan for their mortality, neglecting to draft wills, put a power of attorney in place or designate beneficiaries for financial accounts. Overall, the share of households with life insurance has ""steadily"" decreased since the early 1970s, according to the ACLI. There are likely many reasons for that drop-off.

watch now

For one, younger generations are deferring big financial and life milestones such as getting married, buying a home and having kids relative to older generations. Each of these events generally acts as a key trigger to buy life insurance, experts said. Higher-costing homeownership and child care, coupled with rising debt burdens (for student loans, for example), may mean younger households are less willing or able to pay monthly insurance premiums, said Knoll, a senior financial planner at The Planning Center. Insurance costs themselves are also generally rising for consumers, Shapiro said. Additionally, life insurance is often not typically easy or quick to buy due to factors such as medical testing for underwriting, Shapiro said. ""It's a complex transaction,"" he said.

There are more benign factors at play, too: For instance, fewer consumers have sought out the tax benefits of certain life policies as other tax-advantaged savings options, such as 401(k) accounts and 529 plans, have come into existence, Knoll said. That said, even as fewer people buy life insurance, ""I do think there's a need for it,"" he added. Life insurance isn't necessarily right for everyone, though. Here are some key considerations.

When to buy life insurance

Consumers should consider their financial situation and the standard of living they want to maintain for survivors, such as dependents or spouses, according to the Illinois Department of Insurance. Absent a policyholder's income, there might be a financial shortfall in paying day-to-day household expenses, or for debts and big-ticket items such as tuition, for example. ""Who will be responsible for your funeral costs and final medical bills? Would your family have to relocate? Will there be adequate funds for future or ongoing expenses such as daycare, mortgage payments, or college?"" the department said in a consumer guide. Single people without kids may also have financial obligations, such as funeral expenses, medical bills, debts like credit cards or student loans, and financial support for elderly parents, the IDOI said.

What type of life insurance to buy

There are two broad types of life insurance: term and permanent. Term insurance will typically be best for most consumers, according to financial advisors. These policies last for a designated term, perhaps 10, 20 or 30 years. They generally carry fixed monthly premiums. The length of one's financial obligation is a good guide to the term one should choose, Shapiro said.

It's absolutely clear to me there's a very large gap here. Scott Shapiro U.S. insurance sector leader at KPMG

If a policyholder's spouse is 35 years old and the policyholder seeks a financial hedge until their spouse retires — perhaps at age 65 — the buyer might choose a term of 30 years, for example. Ensuring there's enough money for young kids to go to college might mean having a policy that lasts about 20 years. Permanent life insurance, such as a whole or universal life policy, is meant to last throughout life. It may make sense for consumers to pay for a lifelong policy if they want to leave a financial legacy for charities, or reasonably expect to develop a medical condition that can make it harder to get insurance later. Permanent insurance is generally more costly and complex than a term policy, advisors said. For example, it often carries an interest-bearing account in addition to the insurance component. Policyholders can build up cash value over time depending on factors such as dividends or investment returns. The cash value can have various uses: to pay insurance premiums, as collateral for a loan, or as cash in the event a buyer surrenders their policy in the future. However, there's a lot of fine print and consumers should avoid buying something they don't understand, advisors said.

The EV segment is the U.S. tech giant's second-largest for the region — Cisco generates most of its revenue in Greater China from manufacturing companies, and within that, electric cars form the largest category, said Ming Wong, vice president and CEO of Cisco Greater China.

Chinese EV-makers have ramped up their global expansion in the last year as domestic competition intensified.

However, trade tensions have escalated, with the U.S. and likely the European Union, increasing tariffs on imports of Chinese electric cars.

That doesn't necessarily restrict their growth. Chinese automakers, such as BYD, are investing in local factories.

Cisco, which provides networking equipment and software for businesses, is working with at least 10 electric car customers as they build factories, offices and research and development centers overseas, according to Wong.

""At least as of now, we don't hear anything from the [EV] customers saying that, 'Oh, because of this, we need to stop investing, or we need to slow down,'"" he added.

DETROIT — Purchasing a vehicle has never been that easy. But shoppers entering traditional dealer showrooms for the foreseeable future may have a new challenge: An alphabet soup of ""electrified"" vehicle offerings. As all-electric vehicle adoption crawls along in the U.S., automakers are increasingly releasing various hybrid vehicles as alternative options to EVs and traditional gas-powered engines. A variety of models means more customer choice, but also more complexity for automakers and consumers, many of whom are returning to the new vehicle market for the first time in years following unprecedented supply chain shortages and record used vehicle prices. ""More choice in the marketplace is good for consumers, but only if they understand the differences,"" said Paul Waatti, director of industry analysis at AutoPacific. ""There needs to be more clarity on what the terms and acronyms actually mean, and what the potential benefits and drawbacks are."" A car shopper today has their pick of traditional internal combustion engine (ICE) vehicles; mild-hybrid electric vehicles (MHEVs); hybrid electric vehicles (HEVs); plug-in hybrid electric vehicles (PHEVs); fuel cell electric vehicles (FCEVs) and battery-electric vehicles (BEVs), also commonly known as EVs. Also coming later this year from Stellantis : range-extended electric vehicles (REEVs) that are similar to plug-in hybrid vehicles but can exclusively function as an EV, with its electric motors powered by a gas engine. Each type of vehicle may be better for a different kind of customer. All except EVs and fuel-cell vehicles continue to offer a traditional internal combustion engine combined with ""electrified"" technologies such as a battery or motor to assist in performance or fuel economy. Heather Seymour, of St. Johns, Florida, said she did quite a bit of research prior to purchasing a 2022 Jeep Wrangler Rubicon plug-in hybrid electric vehicle, known as a 4xe model. ""I knew I wanted to kind of dip my toe in the water of the hybrids. I wasn't ready to go full electric, so the plug-in was definitely of interest to me,"" said Seymour, who said she typically uses the all-electric range of the SUV, except on longer trips. ""The more we learned about it, the more we figured out what we wanted.""

EV naming

While consumers may not need to know every acronym or technology to find their right model, automakers aren't exactly helping the situation with their consumer-facing naming. For example, Hyundai's Genesis brand calls its all-electric vehicles ""electrified,"" while many others reserve that term for hybrids. Chrysler's Pacifica minivan is a plug-in hybrid labeled as a regular ""hybrid,"" and Toyota markets some of its traditional hybrids as ""hybrid EVs."" Stellantis says its REEV vehicles are not PHEVs, despite operating similarly. ""Every automaker is using different terms. There's no standardization, and that causes some confusion on the consumer side,"" Waatti said.

Some automakers such as General Motors also use traditional nameplates such as the Chevrolet Blazer and Equinox for new EVs that share little to nothing with their gas-powered counterparts other than the name. Stellantis' Jeep also uses the ""Wagoneer"" moniker for two large gas-powered SUVs as well as a smaller, all-electric Wagoneer ""S"" SUV. Jeep CEO Antonio Filosa has said he isn't worried about any confusion, as the brand has a strong naming heritage and customers can decide which vehicle is best for their needs. ""I believe that we need education, but after education we have a lot of choices for the consumer,"" he said during a recent interview. ""It's all for the benefit of the consumer. They will have a lot of flexibility.""

Education is key

One thing automotive executives from Japan and South Korea to Detroit and Germany can agree on is the need for consumer education. Whether vehicles are electrified or all-electric, they're critical for automakers to meet tightening emissions and fuel economy targets as well as to build production scale, reduce prices and increase profits. ""We don't want to force a customer to do something they're not ready for,"" Kia America VP of Marketing Russell Wager told CNBC earlier this year. ""We're trying our best to educate them.""

Kia and its dealers have put out myth-busting pages online to answer concerns or frequently asked questions about EVs and hybrids. They range from technical questions about batteries to practical questions like whether you can go through a car wash in an EV (you can). GM has taken it a step further. The Detroit automaker launched ""EV Live"" in 2022. It's an online video platform, now known as ""GM Energy Live,"" that allows participants to interact one-on-one with EV specialists and learn about electric vehicles and charging. Ford Motor recently launched its own video-based training program, geared toward its more than 3,000 U.S. franchised dealers to improve customer service, better engage employees and provide dealers and the company with more data to help in selling the vehicles. Auto executives say it's up to the companies as well as their dealers to be trained and educated about the benefits of the vehicles, whatever they may be. ""Each customer, in the end, is very different,"" said Jérémie Papin, chair of Nissan Americas, earlier this year. ""I think it's what the vehicle can do for them,"" not necessarily how the technology works, he said.

Range-extended electric vehicles (REEV): These are an emerging technology that largely function as a PHEV, however after the battery runs out of energy to power the vehicle, an engine works as a generator to exclusively power electric motors. The vehicle still drives like an EV instead of having the engine directly power the vehicle's motion.

That's according to the hundreds of items on display at the Summer Fancy Food Show, a trade show hosted by the Specialty Food Association that has gained a reputation as a place to spot the next big flavors, foods and drinks that will dominate menus and grocery store shelves. The annual show returned to the Jacob K. Javits Convention Center in New York this week, running Sunday through Tuesday. More than 2,400 companies exhibited their foods and drinks for attendees, which include restaurant operators, specialty food retailers and trendspotters. Past show trends that are making their way to mainstream consumers' palettes include yuzu, mushrooms and sophisticated alcohol substitutes. Previous shows have also been a springboard for small brands seeking a wider audience. Honest Tea, Ben & Jerry's and Tate's Bake Shop are among the companies that attended the show in their early days on their way to becoming well-known consumer brands now owned by the industry's biggest players. Here are some highlights from this year's Summer Fancy Food Show:

Honey — as a flavor

Humans have been eating honey for thousands of years, but it's taking center stage as a flavor with some food and beverage makers. In the SFA's preliminary report on the show, its trendspotters called out honey, noting its health benefits. Honey was the star in both foods and drinks across the show. Green Bee showed off its honey soda, which includes a Honeycomb Cider flavor. Owl Creek Organics & Natural Flavors displayed honey spreads, with flavors ranging from caffe mocha to lemon poppyseed. And Dutch company Klepper & Klepper used honey as a flavor for their licorice.

Tinned fish

Krill Arctic Foods' tinned krill meat Amelia Lucas | CNBC

In years past, tinned fish was relegated primarily to booths in the Spanish and Portuguese pavilions. But this year, exhibitors showed off their tinned fish products across the show floor. TikTok helped fuel the tinned fish trend last year, boosting sales of canned sardines. Now specialty food companies are responding. This isn't the canned tuna of yore. There are more flavors, different seafood varieties and trendier packaging. Wildfish Cannery, an Alaska-based company that was founded in 1987, showed off a new retro design for its sockeye salmon, giving it a more upscale feel. Krill Arctic Foods exhibited its canned krill meat, which may lack the same curb appeal on its packaging but boasts about the food's nutritional profile.

Fish to go

Exhibitors also showed off new ways to eat fish on the go, hoping to capitalize on consumers' desire for convenience and more protein in their diets. The association named ""satisfying snacks"" as one of the trends that it's been watching. Acme Smoked Fish highlighted its new Lox in a Box snack kits, available with cream cheese or avocado. Legend of Master International, an Asian food supplier, sampled its Kani fish cake sticks, made to eat like string cheese or for cooking.

Upgraded charcuterie

Fossil Farms' array of salami flavors, including lamb and bison Amelia Lucas | CNBC

Like tinned fish, the popularity of charcuterie boards owes a lot to social media, where users can dazzle their followers with elaborate displays of preserved meats, cheeses and fruit. Companies at the Summer Fancy Food Show showed off some new options to level up the charcuterie — especially the salami. Tempesta Artisan Salumi offered up black truffle-flavored salami, while Salt & Twine's selection included a mezcal and salted lime flavor. But exhibitors weren't just having fun with the flavors. Some are looking beyond pork to make the cured meat. Driftless Provisions' salami uses elk, venison and bison alongside pork. Fossil Farms' salami lineup included lamb and wagyu beef.

Pfizer had a ""phenomenal"" first quarter — and Wall Street took notice, CEO Albert Bourla told thousands of employees during a companywide town hall on May 2, according to a recording heard by CNBC. A day earlier, the pharmaceutical giant's stock had closed 6% higher after its quarterly results topped analyst estimates and it hiked its full-year outlook. It was a far cry from the year prior, when Pfizer's shares plunged more than 40%, making it one of the worst-performing large pharmaceutical stocks of 2023. Its market cap of about $157 billion is now less than half of its 2021 peak of nearly $350 billion. Few companies benefited from the pandemic as much as Pfizer did. The drugmaker's profits boomed, fueled by its Covid vaccine and antiviral pill Paxlovid. After Pfizer and German company BioNTech rapidly developed and deployed a lifesaving shot that helped the world emerge from the pandemic, Pfizer drew widespread praise. Pfizer's success contributed to its equally jarring fall from grace. When the virus receded in 2023, its Covid products revenue plummeted. The world, which hailed Pfizer as a pandemic hero a few years earlier, no longer needed the company in the same way. Pfizer may be on its way toward stabilizing its business and winning back Wall Street's favor after the strong first quarter. But the company is struggling to balance that with the fears of its employees, some of whom said they feel uncertain about their future and unmotivated after the sudden reversal of fortune. In October Pfizer launched a multibillion-dollar cost-cutting program, slashing research and development spending and laying off hundreds of employees — including in the once-lauded Covid vaccine unit. In May the company said it's on track to deliver $4 billion in savings by the end of the year.

Stock Chart Icon Stock chart icon Pfizer's stock surged after it rolled out its Covid vaccine and antiviral treatment, then plunged when the company's Covid revenue started to drop.

Now, as Pfizer appears poised to turn a corner, the company is trying to boost employee morale to match Wall Street's optimism. CNBC spoke with 11 current and former Pfizer employees — all of whom asked to remain anonymous for fear of retaliation — about Pfizer's dizzying climb, rapid decline and turnaround strategy. The company's seesawing fortunes have fueled uncertainty within Pfizer's workforce. Most of the current and former employees CNBC spoke with called Pfizer a good place to work, and some current employees said they feel optimistic about the direction of the company after the first quarter. But other current employees are dissatisfied with where the strategy shift has left them. Some cited higher workloads after teams were stretched thin by budget cuts, a return-to-office policy they said has forced out some remote workers, and doubts about how the business will perform moving forward. The company's separate multiyear cost-cutting program announced in May is also stoking fears about the potential for new U.S. layoffs, according to some current workers. Some employees working in certain manufacturing and supply chain divisions, which they believe are likely to be affected by the cuts, described having low morale and motivation to work. Meanwhile, several former Pfizer employees, most of whom were laid off over the last six months or left voluntarily, said they're unhappy with how the company handled cost cuts in 2023. Some alleged that Pfizer management provided little transparency around the layoffs and seemed more focused on the company's stock performance than its staff throughout the process. During the latest town hall, Bourla told employees that layoffs in the U.S. have been completed but that more are occurring internationally. He called the job cuts ""very, very painful"" and said it was ""killing"" him to let employees go. But he also acknowledged that Wall Street likes the cuts. ""And, of course, I'm very concerned with everyone that could be affected and impacted by that, but it works,"" Bourla said, according to the recording. ""And we saw it, how the Street will respond."" A Pfizer spokesperson said reducing costs will ""put us on strong footing towards margin expansion and improved financial returns moving forward."" The spokesperson added that cutting expenses is one of Pfizer's five priorities for the year, along with maximizing the performance of new products, innovating its drug pipeline, growing its oncology business with its acquisition of cancer drugmaker Seagen, and allocating capital to increase its dividend, reduce outstanding debt and reinvest in the business. To cut costs, apart from layoffs the company is trimming its drug portfolio and direct marketing spending, shrinking its real estate footprint and reducing its investment in Covid, among other efforts, said the spokesperson. The spokesperson said Pfizer does not take the layoffs ""lightly"" and that the company is ""focused on providing our impacted colleagues with the resources and compassion they deserve.""

What went wrong in 2023

Pfizer entered 2023 on a high. The company had just capped a record-breaking 2022 with $100 billion in sales, more than half of which came from its Covid vaccines and Paxlovid. Employee morale at Pfizer was relatively high at the time, some current and former workers told CNBC. The company had gone on a hiring spree and piled money into different projects, they said. The success came with trade-offs. Two former employees involved in developing the Covid vaccine manufacturing process said they were experiencing burnout at the start of 2023. In January 2023, Pfizer forecast a steep drop in annual revenue, to between $67 billion and $71 billion. That outlook included $13.5 billion and $8 billion in sales of Covid vaccines and Paxlovid, respectively. But it could not predict at the time just how much revenue would dry up.

During an earnings call that same month, Pfizer executives said they expected roughly 24% of the U.S. population to get an annual Covid booster in 2023. But by December, only around 17% of U.S. adults had received the new Covid shots from Pfizer and Moderna, according to data from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Many Americans who got previous Covid shots felt they did not need more protection because the threat of the virus had diminished, according to recent surveys. Meanwhile, use of Paxlovid in the U.S. was dented by reductions in Covid testing and infection rates, and by doctors' concerns about interactions with common medications, among other factors. As demand plummeted, the federal government returned millions of the antiviral treatment courses to Pfizer. In January this year, however, Pfizer said fewer courses were returned by the end of 2023 than it had expected. The company soon acknowledged the challenges its Covid business faced towards the end of 2023. In October, Pfizer said it slashed both ends of its 2023 sales guidance by around $9 billion ""solely due to its Covid products."" At the same time, Pfizer started to cut costs. The company still hasn't said how many employees it laid off, though it reduced staff around the world. Pfizer's 2023 revenue ultimately came in at $58.5 billion, including $11.22 billion from its Covid vaccine and $1.28 billion from Paxlovid. The end of the year brought other challenges for Pfizer: The company scrapped the twice-daily version of its experimental weight loss drug, danuglipron, and saw slower uptake for a newly launched RSV vaccine in the U.S. than competitor GSK saw with its own version. After the string of difficulties, investors showed relief when Pfizer announced the cost cuts. But for many employees, the shift in post-pandemic strategy was a nightmare, they told CNBC. During a conference in January, Bourla acknowledged that 2023 was a rough year for the company and its stock price. But he said Pfizer took steps to start 2024 with a ""clean slate."" Those included renegotiating multibillion-dollar Covid contracts with the EU and other governments, transitioning its Covid products to the commercial market in several countries and writing off unused stock of its vaccine and Paxlovid. ""So it's not simple, how many people will use the vaccine. There were a lot of things we had to remove"" he said. Bourla also touted Pfizer's portfolio of new products that it said will boost sales, including nine new product approvals in the U.S. last year and a pipeline of drugs that could bring in more future revenue. Pfizer has also repeatedly said that the Seagen deal brings a proven antibody-drug conjugate platform that enhances its commercial structure and could help the company become a ""world-class oncology leader."" Pfizer has said Seagen could contribute more than $10 billion in risk-adjusted sales by 2030 with its targeted cancer therapies. Those revenue streams would help Pfizer prepare for upcoming patent expirations for blockbuster drugs, including its breast cancer treatment Ibrance, and Eliquis, a blood thinner it shares with Bristol Myers Squibb .

A 'slap in the face'

Some current and former employees said they knew early in 2023 that wide-scale layoffs were possible. Those people alleged that Pfizer has long had a culture of hiring too many people and later laying many employees off — a cycle seen at many other large companies. Pfizer wasn't the only Covid-boom company whose business declined. Biotech company Moderna 's revenue from its Covid shot also plunged in 2023. Companies outside the pharmaceutical industry that flourished in 2020, including fitness firm Peloton and digital meeting platform Zoom , also struggled to adjust as people returned to their pre-pandemic lives. Other drugmakers big and small are still downsizing and restructuring their workforces. Big pharmaceutical companies, such as Bristol Myers Squibb, are trying to conserve cash as they could lose revenue from upcoming drug patent expirations and Medicare drug price negotiations, among other threats. Biotech companies are also working to stay afloat after a rough 2023 marked by rising interest rates, a poor deal market and a lack of fundraising. At Pfizer, there were other warnings of trouble ahead, according to current and former employees: a small round of layoffs during the first quarter of 2023 and budget restrictions that limited travel, team lunch outings and purchases of new lab and manufacturing equipment. Pfizer's announcement in March 2023 that it would acquire Seagen for a whopping $43 billion was another sign, according to some current and former employees. While most of the 11 workers acknowledged that the deal made sense for Pfizer's growth, they said the hefty price tag at a time when Covid sales had already started to decline left them uneasy. Still, a few former employees said they felt blindsided by the company's decision to let go of staff, saying they were relatively optimistic about the business before the October cost-cut announcement. One former employee who worked at a site focused on gene therapies in Durham, North Carolina, said they were repeatedly told their job would be safe — even as Pfizer divested much of its early stage portfolio for those treatments at the start of 2023. The company confirmed with news outlets in October that it would close that site and lay off an undisclosed number of staff. Notably, Pfizer's layoffs also affected some workers involved in the research, development and manufacturing of the company's Covid vaccine, according to some current and former employees. They said those workers, whom Pfizer celebrated as pandemic heroes just a year earlier, felt especially betrayed by the cuts. ""It felt like we were tossed out the door when they no longer needed us,"" said one former employee who worked on the vaccine.

All the current and former employees who spoke with CNBC said they believed the company handled the layoffs and the months leading up to them poorly. Some workers said they were disappointed with what they called higher management's lack of transparency around the layoffs. Some also questioned why Pfizer did not set more realistic expectations for its Covid business earlier, especially as cases and public concern about the virus diminished in the U.S. On Oct. 17, just a few days after Pfizer publicly announced its cost-cutting program to investors, executives held a companywide town hall with Pfizer's more than 80,000-person workforce that one worker described as ""disastrous"" and another called a ""slap in the face."" On the town hall, Bourla and Pfizer Chief Human Experience Officer Payal Sahni Becher acknowledged the company's Covid business was struggling but said it was positioning for growth with the cost cuts, according to some current and former employees. Those people said the executives addressed the looming layoffs during the town hall but provided scant details on how many workers, teams or sites they would affect, when they would occur or how the company decided who would lose their jobs. Many workers also alleged that Bourla and Becher were too casual during the town hall, cracking light jokes and chuckling at some of the questions asked by staff, such as one about employee bonuses.

Return-to-office policies

On top of layoffs, return-to-office policies launched in 2023 forced out some workers in fully remote roles, some current and former employees said. Those people said some fully remote employees had their virtual work status revoked and were asked to start working in person at their site starting on a certain date under the new mandates. While some workers were asked to come in only two or three days a week, even that was impossible for staff members who lived too far from their sites, according to the employees. Some remote workers who did not comply over time were let go, the current and former employees said. A Pfizer spokesperson did not confirm or provide any details about its recent return-to-office policies. ""The return to office has been possibly the worst managed factor in all of this,"" one current employee said.

Those policies also applied to workers who were relocated from recently closed facilities, according to some employees. For example, Pfizer in October said it would shut down its office in Peapack, New Jersey in 2024, which affected nearly 800 workers. The company first announced those plans in 2021. Pfizer told news outlets that the majority of employees would be relocated to its headquarters in New York City. For one employee, a 15-minute commute to work became closer to an hour-and-a-half trip. During another town hall, on Oct. 26, Pfizer Chief Global Supply Officer Mike McDermott said the decision to close the Peapack site ""wasn't made lightly."" But he said having Peapack employees work in person at the company's headquarters was ""right for Pfizer's culture,"" according to a recording heard by CNBC. He said the company isn't taking away remote work as an option. Pfizer leadership has been vocal about asking employees to work in person again. ""Teleconferencing is simply no substitute for the personal interaction that makes it possible to share ideas, build connection, or even agree to disagree,"" Bourla said during the APEC CEO Summit in November. Pfizer is just one of several companies across different industries to push for in-person work again after the pandemic. Tech giants such as Google similarly reversed course on remote work in 2023 after offering flexibility to employees throughout Covid, reportedly frustrating workers.

Employee morale

Employee morale plummeted in the months after the October layoff announcement, according to current and former employees. Some of those people said they were unmotivated to work with their job security in question, while one worker described ""walking on eggshells"" for weeks out of fear that they would lose their job. Other employees said they were stretched thin due to understaffing and a lack of other resources. A few workers said they struggled to keep up with abrupt internal changes, such as being assigned to new managers or being moved onto different teams. Some current employees said Pfizer has held several so-called transparency meetings, which allow workers to anonymously ask questions and provide feedback to senior leadership. Faith in executive leadership also plunged among some workers, according to most of the current and former employees who spoke with CNBC. Some employees acknowledged that executives have a duty to care about their company's stock price but said that Bourla and other officials appeared to be hyper-focused on Pfizer shares even as people lost their jobs. Some current workers said that hasn't appeared to change after the town hall on May 2. Others said Bourla's remarks were encouraging and sounded far more genuine.

NASA and Boeing are further extending the first Starliner crewed flight but are not yet setting a new target date for returning the capsule to Earth, the organizations announced Friday.

Boeing's Starliner capsule ""Calypso"" will stay at the International Space Station into next month while the company and NASA conduct new testing back on the ground. Boeing's crew flight test represents the first time Starliner is carrying people, flying NASA astronauts Butch Wilmore and Suni Williams.

Officials say the Starliner team is starting a test campaign of the spacecraft's thruster technology at White Sands, New Mexico — testing that will be completed before Starliner returns to Earth.

""We think the testing could take a couple of weeks. We're trying to replicate the inflight conditions as best we can on the ground,"" NASA's Commercial Crew manager Steve Stich said during a press conference.

Before launching on June 5, Boeing and NASA planned for Starliner to be in space for nine days. As of Friday, the Starliner flight has tallied 24 days and counting.

Despite the extended stay at the ISS, officials emphasized that Starliner is safe to return at any point in case of an emergency. NASA and Boeing say the delay for testing is solely to gather more data about the spacecraft's performance, in particular its thruster system.

""I want to make it very clear that Butch and Suni are not stranded in space,"" Stich said.

The Starliner crew flight test represents a final major step before NASA certifies Boeing to fly crew on operational, six-month missions. Yet, similar to the previous two spaceflights that were uncrewed, Starliner is running into several problems during the mission.","Boeing's crew flight test represents the first time Starliner is carrying people, flying NASA astronauts Butch Wilmore and Suni Williams.

CNBC,https://www.cnbc.com/2024/06/28/ford-ceo-30000-ev-coming-in-two-and-a-half-years-at-a-profit.html,2024-06-28,21:30:54 UTC,"Ford CEO says a profitable $30,000 EV is coming in two and a half years","An electric Ford truck is displayed during the Electrify Expo D.C. in Washington, D.C., on July 23, 2023.

Ford Motor expects to introduce a $30,000 all-electric vehicle that will be profitable in roughly two and a half years, CEO Jim Farley said Friday during the Aspen Ideas Festival.

Farley did not release many other details about the vehicle, which is being developed by a Ford ""skunkworks"" team, but said its main competitors are expected to be Chinese automakers such as BYD and an anticipated entry-level car from U.S. EV leader Tesla .

Farley said Ford is first focusing on smaller EVs instead of larger all-electric trucks and SUVs, which have historically been gas-powered profit engines for the company, because such vehicles are ""never going to make money.""

""You have to make a radical change as an [automaker] to get to a profitable EV. The first thing we have to do is really put all of our capital toward smaller, more affordable EVs,"" Farley said during an interview with CNBC's Julia Boorstin. ""That's the duty cycle that we've now found that really matches. These big, huge, enormous EVs, they're never going to make money. The battery is $50,000. … The batteries will never be affordable.""

A Ford spokesman later clarified Farley was referring to large vehicles such as the company's Super Duty models or vehicles that require massive battery packs to achieve significant EV ranges of 500 miles. He was not referring to ones such as Ford's current all-electric F-150 Lightning pickup or next-generation EVs.

Ford earlier this year said it was postponing production of a large three-row SUV at a plant in Canada to 2027 from its initial plan of 2025. It also postponed a next-generation pickup, codenamed ""T3,"" from late 2025 to 2026.

Farley on Friday reiterated Ford's next-generation vehicles would be profitable.

He also said Americans need to ""get back in love"" with small cars instead of larger ones, a surprising statement given a majority or Ford's profits come from trucks and considering American carmakers have historically had trouble making money on small models.

""We have to start to get back in love with smaller vehicles. It's super important for our society and for EV adoption,"" Farley said Friday. ""We are just in love with these monster vehicles, and I love them too, but it's a major issue with weight.""

Ford's EV unit lost $1.32 billion during the first quarter of this year on 10,000 vehicles wholesaled. While the unit also includes EV-related business such as software, those losses equate to a loss of $132,000 per vehicle the unit sells.

Farley said it is crucial for Ford to make profitable EVs in the next five years as Chinese automakers continue to expand globally.

""If we cannot make money on EVs, we have competitors who have the largest market in the world, who already dominate globally, already setting up their supply chain around the world,"" he said. ""And if we don't make profitable EVs in the next five years, what is the future? We will just shrink into North America.""","Ford Motor expects to introduce a $30,000 all-electric vehicle that will be profitable in roughly two and a half years, CEO Jim Farley said Friday during the Aspen Ideas Festival.

CNBC,https://www.cnbc.com/2024/06/28/tractor-supply-ends-dei-pride-support-carbon-goals.html,2024-06-28,15:22:47 UTC,"Rural retailer Tractor Supply eliminates DEI roles, Pride support and carbon emissions goals","Shoppers are seen at the parking lot of a Tractor Supply Co. store near Bloomsburg.

Tractor Supply, a retail chain that sells home improvement equipment, livestock and agricultural supplies for farmers and pet owners, is eliminating diversity, equity and inclusion roles; withdrawing carbon emission goals; and walking back support for the LGBTQ community as part of sweeping changes to environmental, social and governance initiatives, the company announced this week.

The retailer said in a Thursday release that it will no longer submit data to the Human Rights Campaign, an LGBTQ advocacy group. The company will also stop sponsoring Pride festivals and voting campaigns, the release said. The company previously earned a perfect score on the Human Rights Campaign Foundation's 2022 Best Places to Work Corporate Equality Index.

The announcement comes in the final days of Pride Month.

Tractor Supply is also retiring initiatives aimed at reducing environmental impact and improving employee diversity. The company had set goals to achieve net zero carbon emissions in operations by 2040 and to reduce its water usage by 2025. Its DEI targets included boosting the number of employees of color at the manager level and above by 50% by 2026.

Tractor Supply said it's making the changes to better represent the values of the communities and customers it serves. The retailer caters to largely rural communities, with 50,000 employees across 2,250 stores in 49 states, according to company data.

""Rural communities are the backbone of our nation and what make America great,"" Tractor Supply said in the news release. ""We have heard from customers that we have disappointed them. We have taken this feedback to heart.""

Tractor Supply said it has invested millions of dollars in veteran causes, state fairs, animal shelters, rodeos and farmers markets and that it invests in the future of rural America by being the largest supporter of FFA, a nonprofit that promotes agricultural education for middle and high schoolers.

The retailer was previously included on Newsweek's list of America's Greatest Workplaces for Diversity in 2023 and was named to Bloomberg's Gender Equality Index for 2022 and 2023.

The publicly traded company has a market valuation of about $29 billion. CNBC contacted Tractor Supply for more details about the changes, and the company declined to comment beyond the release.

The changes come amid a growing wave of anti-DEI sentiment in the wake of a U.S. Supreme Court decision in 2023 to strike down affirmative action in colleges. Experts at the time predicted the ruling could have implications for corporate hiring or recruiting.

Companies, including Starbucks , Disney and Target , have faced legal challenges over DEI initiatives for LGBTQ customers and employees. In February 2023, pharmaceutical giant Pfizer dropped race-based eligibility requirements for a fellowship program designed for college students of Black, Latino and Native American descent, the Associated Press reported.","Shoppers are seen at the parking lot of a Tractor Supply Co. store near Bloomsburg.

CNBC,https://www.cnbc.com/2024/06/27/nike-nke-earnings-q4-2024.html,2024-06-28,15:11:44 UTC,"Nike shares plunge after retailer says quarterly sales will fall 10%, warns on China weakness","Nike shoes and logo are seen at a store in Nice, France on May 28, 2024.

Shares of Nike plunged on Friday after the retailer cut its full-year guidance and said it expects sales to drop 10% during its current quarter as it warned of soft sales in China and ""uneven"" consumer trends across the globe.

The expected 10% first-quarter slump is far below the 3.2% drop that analysts had expected, according to LSEG.

Nike shares plunged nearly 20% in trading Friday.

The sneaker giant, which reported quarterly earnings Thursday, now expects fiscal 2025 sales to be down mid-single digits, compared to analyst estimates of a 0.9% increase. Nike previously expected sales to grow. The company also expects sales in the first half to be down in the high single digits, compared to previous guidance of declines in the low single digits.

""A comeback at this scale takes time,"" the retailer's finance chief Matthew Friend said on a call with analysts Thursday. ""Although the next few quarters will be challenging, we are confident that we are repositioning Nike to be more competitive with a more balanced portfolio to drive sustainable, profitable, long-term growth.""

The company cut its guidance as it contends with slower online sales, planned declines in classic footwear franchises, ""increased macro uncertainty"" in the Greater China region and ""uneven consumer trends"" across Nike's markets, Friend said. It also expects sales into wholesalers to be slower as it scales new innovations and pulls back on classic franchises.

For the fiscal fourth quarter, the company handily beat earnings estimates as its cost-cutting efforts continue to bear fruit, but Nike fell short on revenue.

Here's how Nike did during the period compared with what Wall Street was anticipating, based on a survey of analysts by LSEG:

Earnings per share: $1.01 adjusted vs. 83 cents expected

$1.01 adjusted vs. 83 cents expected Revenue: $12.61 billion vs. $12.84 billion expected

The company's reported net income for the three-month period that ended May 31 was $1.5 billion, or 99 cents per share, compared with $1.03 billion, or 66 cents per share, a year earlier.

Sales dropped to $12.61 billion, down about 2% from $12.83 billion a year earlier.

In fiscal 2024, Nike posted sales of $51.36 billion, which is flat compared to the prior year. It's the slowest pace of annual sales growth the company has seen since 2010, excluding the Covid-19 pandemic.

Nike executives attributed the sales miss to a range of factors. They said its lifestyle business declined during the quarter and that momentum in its performance business, such as its basketball and running shoes, wasn't enough to offset it.

Online performance was soft because Nike had a higher share of lifestyle products, more promotions and fewer sales of classic franchises, such as its Air Force 1. It also saw traffic in China decline across all channels beginning in April due to macro conditions in the region.

Despite the traffic decline in China, sales in the region exceeded Wall Street expectations, according to StreetAccount, coming in at $1.86 billion, compared with estimates of $1.79 billion. It was the only geographical segment to top estimates for the period.

Sales in North America, its largest market, came in at $5.28 billion, below StreetAccount expectations of $5.45 billion.

Still, Friend later warned of the ""softer outlook"" in China and said had it not been for Chinese marketplace Tmall's early start to the region's 618 shopping holiday, sales in the country would've fallen short of Nike's internal expectations.

""The China marketplace remains highly promotional, and we continue to manage both Nike and partners' inventory carefully,"" said Friend. ""While our outlook for the near term has softened, we remain confident in Nike's competitive position in China in the long term.""

CNBC,https://www.cnbc.com/2024/06/27/how-walmarts-sams-club-is-trying-to-take-on-costcos-kirkland.html,2024-06-27,12:10:56 UTC,How Walmart-owned Sam's Club is trying to take on Costco's private label Kirkland,"Stuck at home during the Covid pandemic, Megan Crozier needed a way to keep her two young children entertained. She bought an inflatable pool from Sam's Club.

The pool began leaking air after just a few uses.

For Crozier, chief merchant of the Walmart -owned membership club, that trashed pool — and the disappointment that came with it — helped kickstart a years-long effort to catch up with chief rival Costco and the popularity of its private brand, Kirkland Signature.

As Sam's Club opens more locations, it is trying to raise the bar for its own brand, Member's Mark. The label's makeover has become critical for Sam's Club as it aims to close the gap with Costco, which has roughly the same number of U.S. clubs but about twice as much annual revenue. Net sales for Sam's Club totaled $86.2 billion in its most recent fiscal year, compared with $176.63 billion for Costco's U.S. clubs.

Sam's Club CEO Chris Nicholas told CNBC the brand's revamp was inspired, in part, by the retailer's chief rival.

""The club model survives because you have brilliant merchants focusing on creating or buying exceptional items,"" he said in an interview. ""Costco did such a great job of that over the years with Kirkland and we saw that be successful.""

The success of Member's Mark will help determine how Sam's Club fares as its expands, with plans to open more than 30 stores over the next four years. At least some stores will be in regions where potential customers belong to a competing club like Costco or B.J.'s Wholesale , or in areas where customers may need convincing to pay an annual membership to be able to shop.

Overtaking Costco and its beloved private label won't be easy for Sam's Club, said Michael Baker, a retail analyst for D.A. Davidson.

""Never say never,"" he said. ""Who knows? But I think it's going to take a long time.""

But he added Costco's success with Kirkland Signature created a formula that Sam's Club can follow.

The popularity of Kirkland's brand, which includes a diverse range of items like vodka, batteries and dress shirts, has helped to drive membership sign-ups and renewals. It is one of the features that Costco highlights when the retailer's pitch to members.","As Sam's Club opens more locations, it is trying to raise the bar for its own brand, Member's Mark.

CNBC,https://www.cnbc.com/2024/06/27/goodrx-tracker-drug-prices-rise.html,2024-06-27,22:10:55 UTC,"Drug prices have risen almost 40% over the past decade, according to a new tracker","The cost of prescription medications in the U.S. has increased 37% since 2014, far surpassing the rate of inflation, according to data from drug savings company GoodRx .

Though the price increases have slowed this year in comparison to the past decade, the higher costs are raising out-of-pocket expenses for consumers. The average American spends $16.26 out of pocket per prescription, according to the data.

""When things increase … inevitably, they do trickle down to consumers, especially those who are in a high deductible plan or who don't have insurance or find themselves paying substantially out of pocket,"" said GoodRx director of research Tori Marsh.

GoodRx said the patients' share of the cost continues to grow due to rising copays, coinsurances and deductibles. The company found that over the past 10 years, the average person's deductible nearly doubled, and copays are rising as the majority of plans are adding another tier of drugs with higher copays.

It is a dynamic GoodRx deems ""the big pinch."" High medication costs are coupled with reduced insurance coverage. Analyzing coverage for more than 3,700 Medicare Part D plans between 2010 and 2024, GoodRx found that the portion of medications covered dropped 19% during that period.

""The impact is really kind of threefold,"" Marsh said. ""Rising costs or rising prices are a big part of it, but it's really that with the combination of increased friction. … It's hard for people to, in some ways, access their medication or access a pharmacy. And then on top of that, insurance is not what it used to be. It's not covering as much as it used to.""

On average, Americans pay two to three times more for prescription drugs than consumers in other developed countries, according to the White House.

Drug costs have become a focus for President Joe Biden, particularly as he approaches the 2024 election. The Biden administration has taken several measures to lower out-of-pocket drug expenses.

On Wednesday, the White House announced it would lower prices on 64 prescription drugs for some Medicare beneficiaries as a result of inflation penalties on drugmakers.

The lower costs, effective during the third quarter, will benefit roughly 750,000 people who use the drugs annually, some of whom could save up to $4,593 per day, according to the release.

""Despite efforts by policymakers and industry leaders to break down affordability and accessibility barriers, a patient's actual out-of-pocket cost continues to increase and is often a huge surprise to them,"" said GoodRx interim CEO Scott Wagner in a news release.

Tesla is losing its lead over legacy automakers in the quality of its new all-electric vehicles, according to an annual influential study conducted by J.D. Power.

The 2024 U.S. Initial Quality Study found the quality of Tesla's battery-electric vehicles, or BEVs, and those of traditional carmakers were the same, at 266 problems reported per 100 newly sold or leased vehicles.

Previously, Tesla models had outperformed the electric vehicles of legacy automakers in the annual survey. Last year, the Tesla received a rank of 257 problems per 100 vehicles, compared with 265 problems per 100 vehicles on average for EVs from traditional automakers.

The study attributes Tesla's growing problems to a negative response from customers after the company removed traditional feature controls, such as turn signals and wiper stalks.

Across the broader industry, not just BEVs, Tesla has consistently ranked toward the bottom in initial quality since J.D. Power began including Tesla in the study in 2022.

Overall, the study, which included repair visits data of franchised dealers for the first time, found electric vehicles such as BEVs and plug-in hybrid electric vehicles (PHEVs), are plagued with more problems than traditional gas- and diesel-powered vehicles with internal combustion engines.

""Owners of cutting edge, tech-filled BEVs and PHEVs are experiencing problems that are of a severity level high enough for them to take their new vehicle into the dealership at a rate three times higher than that of gas-powered vehicle owners,"" J.D. Power's senior director of auto benchmarking, Frank Hanley, said in a news release.

The study found that plug-in vehicles require more repairs than gas-powered vehicles across all repair categories.

BEVs averaged 266 problems per 100 vehicles, 86 points higher than gas- and diesel-powered vehicles, which averaged 180 problems per 100 vehicles, according to the study. A lower score indicates higher vehicle quality.

Top concerns included features, controls and displays as well as wireless smartphone integration, as customers reported frequent difficulties with Apple CarPlay and Android Auto.

The study also reported frustration over false warnings, unnecessary traffic alerts and automatic braking features. Specifically, rear seat reminders contribute 1.7 problems per 100 vehicles across the industry, as owners report receiving signals even when no one is in the rear seat.

""It is not surprising that the introduction of new technology has challenged manufacturers to maintain vehicle quality,"" Hanley said.

2025 Rivian R1S Rivian

A Thursday investor event for Rivian Automotive that focused on cost-cutting efforts, efficiency gains and in-house technologies and software wasn't enough to build on the company's significant share growth this week. Shares of the all-electric vehicle startup fell by about 2% to 6% for much of the event, eating into some of its 23% gain in shares the day before on news of an up to $5 billion investment by Volkswagen Group . Rivian's stock closed Thursday down 1.8% to $14.47 per share, off by roughly 39% year to date amid investor concerns regarding cash burn and a slowdown in EV sales. Rivian on Thursday reconfirmed its 2024 guidance that included production of 57,000 vehicles and a path to positive gross profit during the fourth quarter, including regulatory credits. It also outlined longer-term growths, such as plans to achieve positive adjusted earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization in 2027. ""Everything that you're hearing from us, around our product, around how we're running the business, around how we're driving toward profitability, my hope is that you're seeing really an extreme sense of urgency,"" Rivian CEO RJ Scaringe said during the event. ""We're very, very fast driving towards the improvements necessary to get to positive free cash flow and, before that, positive margins this year.""

Rivian also outlined long-term financial targets of a roughly 25% gross margin, 10% free cash flow and adjusted profit margin in the ""high teens."" The company did not release a time frame for these targets. Scaringe spent much of his time during the roughly four-hour presentation discussing efficiencies in products and manufacturing, which he said are expected to lead to 20% material cost reductions in its current vehicles, followed by 45% targeted reductions in its upcoming ""R2"" vehicles, which are projected to begin production in early 2026. The reductions range from physical savings, such as a 54% decrease in design costs of its R2 vehicles compared with current models, to lower costs on more complex systems such as battery packs and electrical hardware. For example, the company is using 10 fewer in-house electronic control units, or ECUs, in its recently redesigned R1 vehicles, allowing it to remove 1.6 miles in wiring harness length and 44 pounds out of the vehicle. Rivian's software expertise is at the center of VW's plans to invest $5 billion in the automaker by 2026, including an anticipated joint venture between the companies to create electrical architecture and software technology. Volkswagen is expected to use Rivian's electrical architecture and software stack for vehicles beginning in the second half of the decade, Scaringe said during the investment announcement. He said the joint venture does not include anything with battery technologies, vehicle propulsion platforms, high voltage systems or autonomy and electrical hardware.

CNBC,https://www.cnbc.com/2024/06/27/walgreens-wba-earnings-q3-2024.html,2024-06-27,20:35:07 UTC,Walgreens stock plunges as drugstore chain slashes profit guidance in 'challenging' consumer environment,"Shares of Walgreens closed more than 20% lower on Thursday after the company reported fiscal third-quarter earnings that fell short of expectations and slashed its full-year adjusted profit outlook, citing a ""challenging"" environment for pharmacies and U.S. consumers.

The retail pharmacy giant now expects fiscal 2024 adjusted earnings of $2.80 to $2.95 per share. That compares with the company's previous outlook of between $3.20 and $3.35 per share.

""'We assumed ... in the second half that the consumer would get somewhat stronger"" but ""that is not the case,"" Walgreens CEO Tim Wentworth told CNBC.

He added that ""the consumer is absolutely stunned by the absolute prices of things, and the fact that some of them may not be inflating doesn't actually change their resistance to the current pricing. So we've had to get really keen, particularly in discretionary things.""

Still, Walgreens topped revenue estimates for the quarter on strong performance in its health-care segment. The company views that business division as critical to its ongoing push to transform from a major drugstore chain into a large health-care company.

The results come as Walgreens works to slash costs after a rocky last year marked by low pharmacy reimbursement rates, weakening demand for Covid products and a challenging macroeconomic environment.

The company on Friday said it is simplifying its U.S. health-care portfolio and finalizing plans to close underperforming U.S. stores over multiple years, among other ongoing cost-cutting efforts.

""Seventy-five percent of our stores drive 100% of our profitability today,"" Wentworth said. ""What that means is the others we take a hard look at, we are going to finalize a number that we will close.""

Here's what Walgreens reported for the three-month period ended May 31 compared with what Wall Street was expecting, based on a survey of analysts by LSEG:

Earnings per share: 63 cents adjusted vs. 68 cents expected

63 cents adjusted vs. 68 cents expected Revenue: $36.4 billion vs. $35.94 billion expected

Walgreens booked sales of $36.4 billion for the quarter, up 2.6% from the same period a year ago.

The company reported net income of $344 million, or 40 cents per share, for the quarter. That compares with net income of $118 million, or 14 cents per share, for the same period a year ago.

Excluding certain items, adjusted earnings were 63 cents per share for the quarter.

Walgreens did not provide a new revenue forecast for the fiscal year. The company has not offered that guidance since October, when it said it expected $141 billion to $145 billion in sales.","Shares of Walgreens closed more than 20% lower on Thursday after the company reported fiscal third-quarter earnings that fell short of expectations and slashed its full-year adjusted profit outlook, citing a ""challenging"" environment for pharmacies and U.S. consumers.

Vcg | Visual China Group | Getty Images

Chinese automakers are expected to continue rapidly expanding outside of their home country to achieve 33% of the global automotive market share by 2030, according to a new report released Thursday by prominent consulting firm AlixPartners. Much of the growth, from a forecast 21% market share this year, is expected to come outside of China. Sales outside of China are expected to grow from 3 million this year to 9 million by 2030, representing growth from 3% to 13% of market share by the end of this decade. The rapid expansion of Chinese automakers is a growing concern for legacy automakers and politicians globally. Many fear that the less-expensive, China-made vehicles will flood the markets, undercutting domestic-produced models, especially all-electric vehicles.

AlixPartners said it expects the Chinese brands to grow across all markets globally. However, the firm added that it expects far smaller expansion in Japan and North America, including the U.S., where vehicle safety standards are more stringent and a 100% tariff on imported Chinese EVs has been announced.

Several new reports show the price gains are shrinking and home sellers are starting to give in after a stagnant spring market.

For the first time since the start of the Covid-19 pandemic, when home sales ground to a halt, the typical house sold for slightly less than its asking price — 0.3% lower — during the four weeks ended June 23, according to real estate brokerage Redfin. A year ago at that time the typical home was selling at list price. Two years ago it was selling at about 2% above list price.

That's not to say that the housing market is crashing. A little less than two-thirds of homes still sold over asking price in the last month; that is, however, the lowest share since June 2020. While most sellers are still listing their homes at higher prices than comparable homes sold for a year ago, some are conceding that they simply can't command those prices.","Some of the heat is coming out of home prices, even though they're still higher than they were a year ago.

Maxar Technologies | Via Reuters

NASA will have a spacecraft from Elon Musk's SpaceX guide the International Space Station's destruction later this decade, the agency announced Wednesday. The National Aeronautics and Space Administration awarded an $843 million contract to SpaceX to build the so-called ""U.S. Deorbit Vehicle."" The spacecraft will be designed to guide the football-field-sized research laboratory back into the Earth's atmosphere after retiring in 2030. The SpaceX-built vehicle will effectively destroy the ISS by pushing the station into reentry from orbit. ""It is crucial to prepare for the safe and responsible deorbit of the International Space Station in a controlled manner,"" NASA said in a press release, with the U.S. Deorbit Vehicle needed to ""ensure avoidance of risk to populated areas.""

NASA did not specify whether SpaceX's design for the U.S. Deorbit Vehicle will be based on one of the company's existing spacecraft, such as its Dragon capsules. SpaceX and NASA did not immediately respond to CNBC's request for comment on the design. Sign up here to receive weekly editions of CNBC's Investing in Space newsletter. The U.S. – along with four international partner agencies representing Russia, Europe, Canada, and Japan – has been preparing for the eventual end of the ISS, which has been crewed since 2000. The ISS, primarily created as a crewed research laboratory, has seen more than 3,300 experiments conducted in microgravity. That includes research not possible on Earth such as medical sciences and technology demonstrations.

Aging ISS

But the ISS is aging, with NASA and its lead partner Roscosmos, unable to solve a worsening problem of microscopic leaks on the station. NASA published a study on Wednesday with analysis of why it decided to intentionally destroy the ISS in a controlled reentry. The agency evaluated a variety of alternatives, including disassembling the station in orbit or trying to raise the ISS to a higher orbit with a large spacecraft like SpaceX's Starship. ""The space station is a unique artifact whose historical value cannot be overstated. NASA considered this when determining if any part of the station could be salvaged for historical preservation or technical analysis,"" the agency wrote. Ultimately, the agency study determined that any attempts to preserve or reuse the ISS were technically or economically infeasible. NASA noted the possibility the ISS' operational lifetime could be extended beyond 2030, but that is yet to be determined and requires agreement with its international partner agencies. NASA is planning to replace the ISS through private space stations and is helping fund U.S. companies' development through the Commercial LEO Destinations (CLD) program. The ISS totaled about $150 billion to develop and build and costs NASA about $4 billion each year to operate, so the agency sees privately built space stations as a way to replace the ISS at a fraction of the cost.","A satellite image shows an overview of the International Space Station with the Boeing Starliner spacecraft, June 7, 2024.

CNBC,https://www.cnbc.com/2024/06/26/levi-levi-earnings-q2-2024.html,2024-06-27,09:17:32 UTC,Levi's shares drop 15% as jeans maker's sales disappoint despite denim craze,"Denim is having a moment with consumers, but it hasn't led to a major sales boost at Levi Strauss .

The jeans creator on Wednesday posted fiscal second-quarter revenue that fell just short of Wall Street's expectations at a time when shoppers are stocking their wardrobes with denim dresses, skirts and ultra low-rise baggy pants.

Levi's posted better-than-expected earnings as its direct sales to consumers and cost cutting continue to bear fruit. The company raised its dividend by 8% to 13 cents per share, its first increase in six quarters.

Still, shares fell about 15% in extended trading.

Here's how Levi's performed during the quarter compared with what Wall Street was anticipating, based on a survey of analysts by LSEG:

Earnings per share: 16 cents adjusted vs. 11 cents expected

16 cents adjusted vs. 11 cents expected Revenue: $1.44 billion vs. $1.45 billion expected

The company's reported net income for the three-month period that ended May 26 was $18 million, or 4 cents per share, compared with a loss of $1.6 million, or zero cents a share, a year earlier. Excluding one-time items, Levi's posted earnings of $66 million, or 16 cents per share.

Sales rose to $1.44 billion, up about 8% from $1.34 billion a year earlier. However, the sales jump was coming off of an easier comparison.

In the year-ago period, sales were down 9% after Levi's shifted its wholesale shipments from its fiscal second quarter into its fiscal first quarter. The shift reduced sales last year by about $100 million, the company said previously. Excluding the shift, as well as the exit of Levi's Denizen business, sales would have been up by only about 1% in its most recent quarter compared to the year-ago period.

Finance chief Harmit Singh attributed the sales miss to unfavorable foreign exchange conditions and weak sales at Docker's. During the quarter, the khaki and chinos brand saw $82.4 million in sales, up 8.6% from $75.8 million in the year ago period. It's not clear how sales at Docker's were affected by the timing of Levi's wholesale orders.

""People are generally cautious,"" Singh told CNBC in an interview. ""It's not necessarily an environment where people are buying a lot, people are cautious.""

While Levi's posted a strong earnings beat, it only reaffirmed its full-year guidance, which was in line with estimates. The company continues to expect full-year earnings per share to be between $1.17 and $1.27, which now includes a 5-cent hit coming from the company's new distribution and logistics strategy.

Levi's said it is transitioning from a primarily owned-and-operated distribution and logistics network in the U.S. and Europe to one that relies more on third parties.

""In the near term, these changes require the parallel operation of new and old facilities for the rest of 2024, resulting in a transitory increase in distribution costs,"" the company said.

The change allows Levi's to shift the responsibility of final mile delivery to third parties. The denim maker noted that it has new terms with its supplier that result in Levi's taking ownership of inventory closer to the point of shipment rather than its eventual destination. Levi's distribution network was built for a business that primarily sold to wholesalers, and now it needs to change into one that's more focused on selling directly to consumers.

The changes are necessary because nearly half of Levi's sales these days are coming from its own website and stores.

Direct-to-consumer sales jumped 8% during the quarter, representing 47% of overall sales. Online sales increased 19%.

""Our transformational pivot to operating as a DTC-first company is yielding positive results around the world, giving me great confidence that we will achieve accelerated, profitable growth for the rest of the year and beyond,"" CEO Michelle Gass said in a statement.

During the quarter, wholesale revenue grew 7%, but excluding the shift in timing of wholesale orders, sales in the channel decreased 4%. Singh noted that wholesale revenue improved on a sequential basis, but the company has a ""conservative"" view of the channel's growth moving forward.

By building out its own direct channels, Levi's enjoys higher profits, better data on its consumers and less reliance on shaky wholesalers like Macy's and Kohl's, which are continuing to shrink and fall out of favor with consumers.

However, selling directly can also be more expensive, and can come with unexpected hiccups that can impact sales and drain profits. For example, when someone buys a pair of Levi's from Macy's and wants to return them, Macy's typically bears that cost. Under a direct model, that responsibility, including the cost and logistics, would fall on Levi's.

Nike has come to be known as a cautionary tale for retailers long reliant on wholesalers that try to expand direct sales.

For a while, Nike's focus on direct sales boosted revenue and profits, but some critics said the strategy shift led to a slowdown in innovation, and ultimately, market share losses.

Recently, the company acknowledged that it erred when it cut off so many of its wholesale partners and said it has since ""corrected"" that.

It's been almost 20 years since the founding of Alphabet's YouTube, and Hollywood still doesn't really know what to do with it. YouTube, which effectively invented user-generated content, claims a daunting share of overall media consumption. And it's no longer just dominating the internet, it's dominating the living room, too. YouTube made up 9.7% of all viewership on connected and traditional TVs in the U.S. in May — the largest share of TV for a streaming platform ever reported by Nielsen's monthly ""The Gauge"" report. Netflix ranked second, claiming 7.6% of viewership. Among streamers only, YouTube's total viewership was close to 25% market share. ""We're not talking about your mobile phone, your laptop, that I'm sure you see your kids using all the time, but on the biggest screen in the house, the TV,"" said LightShed media analyst Rich Greenfield. ""Every [media] executive has to be paying attention."" But media companies such as Netflix, Disney and Warner Bros. Discovery aren't sure whether YouTube is friend or foe. Some media executives see YouTube as a companion platform to subscription streaming services and cable TV — an unwieldy behemoth of non-narrative, creator-led content with a social media slant that doesn't really fit the New York-Hollywood nexus of professional media. Others — even at times the same executives — view YouTube as an existential threat to the entertainment industry, stealing viewership from subscription streaming services and, with it, the cultural center of American youth. Those competing truths have led media and entertainment companies to concoct a wide array of strategies to combat the growing threat. Disney leaders discuss YouTube ""every day"" in strategic meetings and have considered adding user-generated content to Disney+, though it's not on the immediate roadmap, according to people familiar with the matter, who asked not to be named because the discussions are private. Netflix and Warner Bros. Discovery, on the other hand, have consciously chosen to focus on the other 90% of the TV viewing world that isn't YouTube. ""I do think it snuck up on people that YouTube was as important a presence in people's lives and people's viewing experiences not just on the phone but in the living room,"" said Tara Walpert Levy, YouTube's vice president of Americas, in an interview. ""When Nielsen first noted that YouTube was winning the streaming wars in terms of viewing, full stop, not just for ad-supported platforms, I had a ton of my friends from advertising, from media, who were like, 'Can you believe it?' It exceeded even our expectations,"" she said.

YouTube's growing dominance

Earlier this year, YouTube Chief Executive Officer Neal Mohan announced that users watch more than 1 billion hours of YouTube content on TV screens each day. More than 150 million Americans watch YouTube on connected TVs each month, according to the company. Ad dollars have followed. In 2023, YouTube took in $31.5 billion in advertising revenue, up 8% from 2022 and 271% from six years ago. In the first quarter of 2024, YouTube's ad revenue climbed 21% from a year earlier to $8.1 billion. YouTube, founded in 2005, sold to Google for $1.65 billion a year later. It's since ballooned in size as advertisers flocked to the platform. MoffettNathanson media analyst Michael Nathanson estimated in March that YouTube would be worth a whopping $400 billion as a standalone company — more than Disney and Comcast combined. ""YouTube is still the 800-pound gorilla in this space, and I do believe they're a pretty unstoppable juggernaut,"" said Candle Media co-CEO Kevin Mayer, who previously ran Disney's streaming business and was briefly CEO of TikTok.

Disney's YouTube focus

Disney executives are particularly attuned to YouTube's rising dominance, given its grip on younger people, according to people familiar with the company's thinking. Disney has a legion of super-fans who flock to YouTube and other social media sites to promote and critique its parks, rides and merchandise, movies and TV shows. Integrating some of that content as shoulder programming to Disney's scripted series and movies could help keep users on Disney+. A Disney spokesperson declined to comment on conversations about adding original content to the platform. The company claims 11.4% of TV viewership, according to Nielsen's ""The Gauge"" report, when adding up cable and streaming, including Hulu and ESPN.

You're betraying your audience. You're leaving YouTube to act, and then you're not posting online anymore, and you're asking them to wait on a project that's in development for what? A year, two years? People are going to forget about you, girl. That's how the internet works."" Brittany Broski YouTube creator

""I think what we're seeing from all of these traditional media companies is they don't have enough content, and it's too expensive to produce the types of premium content at scale that they need. And so maybe the [user-generated content] economy is a place they look ... not to create their competitor, but as a lower cost way to add content to their services,"" said LightShed's Greenfield. Disney is also considering putting more full episodes of Disney+ and Hulu series geared to older kids and adults directly on YouTube to entice an audience that isn't currently subscribing to its streaming platforms, said a person familiar with the matter. This is a strategy Disney has done with kids content for years, helping amplify hit animated series such as ""Bluey,"" ""Spidey and his Amazing Friends"" and ""Mickey Mouse Clubhouse.""

""At the end of the day, Disney is a storytelling machine,"" said Mayer. ""We used short-form video on YouTube as a promotional device for our content. But I don't think that we at Disney, nor have any other traditional media companies, leaned into YouTube as an original storytelling device the way they probably should have."" According to internal research, Disney executives concluded that younger Americans use YouTube as an online encyclopedia, said one of the people familiar with the company's discussions. That's led the company to focus on the benefits of the platform's discovery functionality while also programming against it, the person said. Disney has made bespoke YouTube content for its new preschool series ""Disney Junior's Ariel,"" which debuts June 27, to introduce the mermaid character to kids. It has also developed a series of ""Winnie the Pooh"" shorts so that it can research how the animated bear and his friends resonate with today's youth. The company is now considering making a full-length animated series on ""Winnie the Pooh"" based on the short-form video data, the person said.

Netflix's muted response

Netflix is taking on YouTube from a different angle. It doesn't view the platform as the same singular threat to viewership that some of its peers do. Netflix famously considers everything that could occupy a user's time, even sleep, as a long-term competitor. For the time being, Netflix executives consider YouTube as catering to a different consumer need. ""We have built a hard-to-replicate combination of a strong slate, superior recommendations, broad reach and intense fandom, which drives healthy engagement on Netflix. Improvement in these key areas is the best way to delight our members and continue to grow our business,"" Netflix said in its most recent quarterly shareholder letter. Netflix has even found some success duplicating content on YouTube in specific instances. ""Cocomelon,"" the animated toddler-geared short-form video series owned by Candle Media's Moonbug Entertainment, has become massively popular on both YouTube and Netflix. ""Cocomelon"" has 175 million subscribers to its English language YouTube channel, and ""many more if you add in all languages,"" Mayer said. At the same time, ""Cocomelon"" frequently tops Netflix's most-watched list among kids shows.

Posters showing ""Blippi"" and ""Cocomelon"" characters are displayed at the Moonbug Entertainment stand during the Brand Licensing Europe event at ExCel, in London, Oct. 04, 2023. John Keeble | Getty Images

The more immediate YouTube threat for Netflix comes from an advertising perspective. Netflix is now going head-to-head with YouTube for marketing dollars after introducing its ad-supported tier in November 2022. Netflix said in May that it has 40 million global monthly active users for its advertising tier. That's a far cry from YouTube's more than 2 billion monthly active users. Netflix is even contemplating launching free versions of its service in certain international markets to court advertisers, though there's nothing concrete planned, Bloomberg reported earlier this week. Netflix declined to comment for this story.

Other strategies

Comcast -owned NBCUniversal has experimented with new ways to copy the rabbit-hole effect of YouTube Shorts, which force-feed users content based on interest, by offering curated clips of ""Saturday Night Live"" sketches, scenes from ""The Office"" or favorite Bravo show moments. If younger users are being conditioned to watch in a certain way, NBCUniversal's Peacock streaming service wants to give consumers that choice in addition to its long-form movies and TV shows. But simply curating feeds within a content vertical now feels like a ""YouTube 1.0 strategy"" given how TikTok, YouTube Shorts and Instagram Reels have redefined short-form viewing, according to Nathanson. ""I don't think, at this point, there's a strategy in place among any of the traditional media players to create content for the YouTube generation that's more than just their branded strategy they're doing now,"" said Nathanson. ""The future strategy is to use AI to deliver personalization for each of us. Today, none of the traditional media players has that. That's YouTube 2.0."" Amazon is trying a more direct plan of attack — pay YouTube's biggest star to make a show for their own service. The company announced a deal earlier this year with MrBeast, whose real name is Jimmy Donaldson, to make a reality TV show, ""Beast Games,"" that will pay the winner $5 million in cash. The format will largely borrow from previous MrBeast giveaway videos that pit many contestants against each other for cash, using a ""fast-paced and high-production format,"" as Amazon has promised.

MrBeast's YouTube channel has the most subscribers worldwide at 289 million and expects to take in a whopping $700 million in revenue in 2024, primarily through advertising and brand deals. But while MrBeast may have crossover appeal, there's skepticism among creators that YouTube celebrities will have success making shows for subscription streaming services. Moreover, the entire Hollywood system may operate too slowly for a younger generation that demands immediate content.

YouTube's community

The popularity of YouTube stems from the authentic relationship creators have with their fans, according to Brittany Broski, 27, whose YouTube channel has more than 2 million subscribers. ""I still watch Netflix and HBO, where if I want a good fantasy series or whatever, I know where to go for that. But what YouTube is more concerned with is in this digital age, we've lost a sense of community and a sense of third spaces where we can go to hang out and meet new friends,"" Broski said. Broski's audience, which she described as Generation Z and young millennial women and members of the LGBTQ+ community, ballooned during the pandemic. Stuck at home with limited social options, hundreds of thousands of people found Broski as they searched for fresh, real-time content. That personal relationship is YouTube's secret sauce, and it doesn't translate when creators port to other services, Broski said. ""You're betraying your audience,"" said Broski. ""You're leaving YouTube to act, and then you're not posting online anymore, and you're asking them to wait on a project that's in development for what? A year, two years? People are going to forget about you, girl. That's how the internet works.""

The business model of YouTube for successful creators incentivizes staying on the platform. YouTube has shared more than $70 billion with its creators over the last three years through its Partner Program, which shares advertising revenue with more than 3 million channels on the platform. ""Why would I create a show and sell it to a network when I could just put it on YouTube?"" Broski said. ""You're self-funding, but if the money you're making from AdSense is going right back into your content to make more money, why do you even have to contact that third party?"" YouTube also benefits from a low barrier to entry to create content and from instant feedback through comments from fans that often help shape future content immediately. That model can't be replicated in a scripted form, where full seasons of TV shows are premade and rolled out on specific schedules. ""In the traditional industry, it's about proving to other people that the content deserves to be made, deserves to be seen, deserves a marketing campaign, deserves dollars behind it,"" said YouTube star and former professional cyclist Michelle Khare, 31, whose channel has more than 4.5 million subscribers. ""With YouTube, if you have the drive, the ability, and in many cases, your phone, you can skip those steps and put it out into a democratic platform where the audience ultimately decides what rises to the top.""

CNBC,https://www.cnbc.com/2024/06/26/biden-to-lower-some-drug-costs-through-inflation-penalties.html,2024-06-26,13:24:06 UTC,Biden administration to lower costs for 64 drugs through inflation penalties on drugmakers,"US President Joe Biden speaks during an event at the National Institutes of Health (NIH) in Bethesda, Maryland, US, on Thursday, Dec. 14 2023.

The Biden administration on Wednesday said it will impose inflation penalties on 64 prescription drugs for the third quarter of this year, lowering costs for certain older Americans enrolled in Medicare.

President Joe Biden has made lowering U.S. drug prices a key pillar of his health-care agenda and reelection platform for 2024. A provision of Biden's Inflation Reduction Act requires drugmakers to pay rebates to Medicare, the federal health program for Americans over age 65, if they hike the price of a medication faster than the rate of inflation.

It is separate from another provision under the law that allows Medicare to negotiate lower prescription drug prices with manufacturers. On average, Americans pay two to three times more than patients in other developed nations for prescription drugs, according to the Biden administration.

Some patients will pay a lower coinsurance rate for the 64 drugs covered under Wednesday's announcement, which fall under Medicare Part B, for the period from July 1 to Sept. 30 ""since each drug company raised prices faster than the rate of inflation,"" according to a release from the administration.

Some Medicare Part B patients may save as much as $4,593 per day if they use those drugs during the quarter, the release added.

More than 750,000 Medicare patients use the drugs each year, according to the release. The medications treat conditions such as cancer, certain infections and a bone disease called osteoporosis.

The list includes Bristol Myers Squibb's Abecma, a cell therapy for multiple myeloma; and Pfizer's targeted cancer treatment for certain lymphomas called Adectris. It also includes Astellas Pharma and Pfizer's Padcev, a targeted cancer treatment for advanced bladder cancer.

The Biden administration said Padcev's price has increased faster than inflation every quarter since the Medicare inflation rebate program went into effect last year.","The Biden administration on Wednesday said it will impose inflation penalties on 64 prescription drugs for the third quarter of this year, lowering costs for certain older Americans enrolled in Medicare.

Delta Air Lines is the country's most profitable airline. CEO Ed Bastian's challenge is to make sure his carrier stays on top. The airline's unit revenue, the amount it brings in for every seat it flies one mile, outpaced its competitors' last year. Delta's share price has soared more than 17% in 2024, one of the strongest performers in the rocky airline sector, in a rally that's outdone the S&P 500 's. It expects free cash flow to rise as much as 50% this year to between $3 billion and $4 billion, and is eyeing a return to an investment-grade credit rating. And a stat any traveler would appreciate: Delta came in first in punctuality last year, with more than 83% of its flights arriving on time, according to the Transportation Department. Rival United Airlines — second to Delta in net profit margins — is circling. It says it could grow profit even more this year. ""Knowing that there's someone that thinks that they can take that mantle from us, that keeps us on our toes and keeps us continuing to drive hard,"" Bastian told CNBC.

Delta has fashioned itself as America's premium airline. It has won over hordes of splurging travelers, many of them carrying American Express cards, Delta's cash cow of a partner that generated almost $7 billion for the airline last year. Sales growth of Delta's roomier and more expensive seats continues to outpace revenue from standard coach. As they vie for luxury flyers, both Delta and United have added more high-end seating to their planes to cater to travelers who deem worthwhile a $300 surcharge for a few inches of extra legroom on a cross-country round trip, or 10 times as much for a seat in business class. Bastian, a former auditor who said he took his first flight at age 25 for a business trip (New York to Chicago), is in charge of ensuring Delta lives up to its brand luster. On Wednesday, Delta took its next shot in the battle for high-spending flyers when it opened its newest, highest tier of airport lounge at New York's John F. Kennedy International Airport for passengers in its Delta One cabin, its top cabin that features lie-flat beds for longer flights. At more than 39,000 square feet it is Delta's largest lounge, accented with pillows that have the iconic zigzag motif of Italian fashion house Missoni, its new amenity kit partner. It features complimentary spa treatments, like ice globes and serum for jet-lagged eyes, along with showers, a full restaurant, and a deck overlooking the airfield, in a bet that travelers' desire to treat themselves is here to stay. Delta is taking a page from the playbooks of United and American , which already dedicate their swankiest lounges to customers flying in long-haul business class. Delta plans to open Delta One lounges in Boston and Los Angeles later this year, and is studying airports where it could open others. ""The thing with this industry is no good idea goes uncopied,"" said Raymond James airline analyst Savanthi Syth. Meanwhile, United is placing huge orders for new Boeing and Airbus planes and remodeling hundreds of narrow-body cabins that feature seatback screens and Bluetooth technology, a strategy that aims to cater to travelers from international business class to those flying on the cheapest basic economy tickets. ""We haven't exactly achieved the No. 1 profitability status in the industry, but I know we're on our way,"" United's chief commercial officer, Andrew Nocella, said in an interview last month. ""If we continue to invest in our customers through great service and great products and great network, we know that will feed upon itself and it'll help us achieve the financial results that we're looking for."" Delta, United and American are approaching their 100th birthdays, and are trying to stay ahead — if not drive — shifting travel demand and still turn a profit. United is adding to the more than 300 airports it serves. Figuring out the next hot destination is ""part art"" and ""part science,"" said Patrick Quayle, its head of network planning. The airline's sprawling global network makes United the biggest U.S. airline by capacity and it recently launched service to places like Dubrovnik, Croatia, and Amman, Jordan. Quayle pointed to United's addition of Cape Town, South Africa, which it first announced before the pandemic, as a success. ""Another airline has subsequently copied us. ... I might want to add based in Atlanta,"" he said, alluding to Delta's home city. The latest changes come at a difficult time for a lot of U.S. airlines. Labor and other costs swelled after the pandemic, eating into margins despite record numbers of travelers. Added capacity in the U.S. market has forced carriers to discount fares in off-peak travel periods. It's tricky, and expensive, to change course. Even Southwest Airlines is facing investor pressure to add things like premium seating or seat assignments as its simple, but long successful, business model shows signs of age.

Meanwhile, U.S. consumers are growing more selective: Some corporate leaders have lamented a spending pullback while others, like Delta's CEO, are saying the opposite. Americans are still digging into the so-called experiences economy, and paying for more comfort along the way, according to Bastian. ""They may not be buying that new EV or that new house, but they're saying we're going to go out and experience the world and invest in that experience,"" he said. ""And that's why you see it happening in high-end concerts, high-end hospitality.""

'Brick by brick'

When the U.S. was careening toward recession almost two decades ago, Delta's leaders made a correct bet that travelers would eventually pay more to fly on its jets. Delta was emerging from Chapter 11 bankruptcy in 2007, which other U.S. carriers found themselves in the years after the Sept. 11, 2001, terrorist attacks. Former CEO Richard Anderson said the airline had to start with basics: stop losing bags. Make sure flights didn't get canceled and arrived on time. Clean up the cabins. ""It was about building the operation brick by brick,"" said Anderson, who handed the reins to Delta's former president, Bastian, in 2016. ""It didn't matter what you did with AmEx. If the flight canceled, you ruined your brand."" Delta took better care to avoid maintenance problems. It also started ferrying planes to airports to avoid cancellations if a replacement aircraft was needed. And the carrier tried to clean up its image, hiring a marketing firm that advised former President Barack Obama's 2008 presidential campaign.

Anderson said the airline needed to be consistent and not fly its mix of paint jobs and cabin interiors. It faced fresh competition from low-cost airlines like a then-spritely upstart out of Queens, New York, called JetBlue Airways . Delta and United had both launched their own low-cost subsidiaries, but they discontinued them. Delta executives knew they needed a brand to match if they were going to command a premium over competitors. ""One of the things about being a premium product is consistency, consistency in policy, consistency in appearance,"" said Anderson. ""If you got on a flight in Tokyo we wanted you to feel like you were home."" After the string of changes, Delta's performance improved. Corporate business travel contracts helped boost profits and still do, as business travel returns post-pandemic. Delta had a key advantage over competitors. After it came out of bankruptcy, it merged with Northwest Airlines in 2008, allowing it to stabilize and expand around the world while other carriers floundered. The rest of the industry spent much of the next decade recovering from bankruptcies and a subsequent musical chairs of mergers that left four big carriers in control of about three-quarters of the U.S. domestic market. Delta's rivals were years behind the carrier on integrating their merged staff, operations, networks and fleets. Bastian said Delta's focus on reliability has made life easier for not just its customers, but also its employees. ""They're not having to explain for a cancellation or mishandled luggage,"" he said. ""They have time to serve rather than to apologize."" Delta is also unique as the least unionized of the major U.S. airlines, at about 20%. In April, as campaigns were underway to organize its flight attendants and other workers, it again raised worker pay. Flight attendants for Delta's regional carrier, Endeavor, which are unionized, have recently demanded compensation on par with the carrier's mainline flight attendants.

Time to remodel

After Delta got the basics down, Bastian, 67, who joined Delta in 1998, said it was time for the airline to focus on more ambitious projects. ""You had the liberty to start investing in premium,"" he said. ""You started to figure out how to make first class more available to customers."" It has expanded in big-spending New York and Los Angeles, the country's two largest air travel markets by revenue, according to aviation data firm OAG. Delta also built up its host of global alliances, joint ventures and minority ownership stakes, giving it more reach. That includes its 49% stake in Virgin Atlantic, which already had a strong foothold in premium air travel and popular lounges. ""I think some of that heritage has made its way into the core of Delta,"" said Virgin Atlantic's CEO, Shai Weiss. ""I'm not suggesting we are the messiah for Delta, but there is no surprise that Delta and Virgin Atlantic see eye to eye on many things."" The vast majority of the more than 940 million people who flew on U.S. airlines last year fly in coach, and Delta has tried to make its flights more desirable to travelers on all sections of the plane. It remodeled old and dated terminals, and built out its network of luxury airport lounges, which are tied to its lucrative credit card deal with American Express. It added seatback televisions and better in-flight entertainment options, and in February 2023, it announced its long-awaited free Wi-Fi to customers enrolled in its SkyMiles frequent flyer program.

Delta has invested more than $12 billion to rebuild and update its U.S. hubs with soaring ceilings, new technology and in some lounges, a signature scent. (""It's proprietary,"" said Claude Roussel, who oversees Delta's lounges, when asked what was in it.) One of its latest efforts is its terminal and new Sky Club at New York's LaGuardia Airport, alongside other airlines' new terminals. A decade ago, then-Vice President Joe Biden famously said someone who was blindfolded and taken to that airport would think, ""I must be in some third-world country."" The airline faced big problems along the way like a dayslong system outage in 2016. And the worst of all: Covid-19. Like other airlines, Delta accepted billions in federal aid to weather the pandemic. The carrier successfully urged some 17,000 workers to take buyouts, hiring newer, lower-paid staff who lacked the experience of departed employees. Early in the process, Bastian said the newer workers gave the company a ""juniority benefit."" The airline employed about 100,000 people in the U.S. as of the end of last year. Delta and its competitors also pulled out of many small cities as the pandemic eased, isolating some smaller cities amid a shortage of regional jet pilots. But international travel has proved resilient so far, as consumers show they are willing to shell out on experiences.

Luxury air travel? In the U.S.?

Luxury air travel and the United States didn't go together for many years — and might not still, if you ask well-heeled globetrotters. U.S. airlines don't offer on-board showers or roomy suites like those on the superjumbos flown by the likes of Etihad Airways or Singapore Airlines. But the U.S. air travel market, the world's largest, has gotten a number of upgrades in recent years, and travelers have grown to expect the same convenience they get from their online shopping sites and ride-hailing and food-ordering apps. ""Delta's not bougie by any stretch, but when your competitors don't try very hard, it doesn't take much,"" said Henry Harteveldt, a former airline executive and founder of Atmosphere Research Group. But as a rewards credit card boom, strong consumer spending, social media envy and a wanderlust that predated the pandemic combined to boost demand, airlines executives were taking notice. Delta's sales from premium products are growing faster than revenue from its main coach cabin, a trend the airline forecasts will continue. Sales from Delta's loyalty business, premium cabins and other streams comprise more than half of the carrier's revenue. Airlines have made big changes as they struggle to accommodate the swelling numbers of big-spending travelers armed with elite status. Major carriers have all overhauled their frequent flyer programs to reward the biggest spenders instead of those who fly the most miles, and made it harder to earn coveted elite status. And at Delta and other airlines, many of the perks for luxury flyers come through lounges. One of Delta's Sky Clubs at Los Angeles International Airport offers a separate, dedicated security checkpoint for customers flying Delta One, away from the masses at the airport. That feature will make it to the new JFK lounge later this year, a Delta spokesman said. United and American Airlines have also worked to glam up and expand their airport lounges, access to which is a common perk with credit cards. Delta softened some restrictions on Sky Club lounge access last year — which it made to end annoying and unsightly long lines to enter its exclusive airport real estate — after an uproar from customers.

'We're constantly pushing each other""

Both Delta and United have issued sunny financial forecasts for this year, while many carriers are losing money or not pulling in similar profit margins. ""Watching [Delta] succeed, I became convinced that the product mattered and service mattered, and we have done that at United now,"" United CEO Scott Kirby said at a JPMorgan industry conference in March. And at an investor conference last month, he pointed to how the two are pulling away from the rest of the pack in profitability, particularly at big hubs. United has made some big bets that paid off. It held onto its wide-body planes, when travel demand collapsed in the pandemic, and has benefited from the surge in international travel. With United on Delta's tail, Bastian is trying to expand the airline's reach. Bastian has attended the massive Consumer Electronics Show in Las Vegas and has announced new partnerships with Lyft and Starbucks for its loyalty program.

CNBC,https://www.cnbc.com/2024/06/25/volkswagen-rivian-stake.html,2024-06-25,23:41:08 UTC,"Rivian secures up to $5 billion from Volkswagen, shares soar more than 50%","Volkswagen Group plans to invest up to $5 billion in electric vehicle startup Rivian , starting with an initial investment of $1 billion.

The additional $4 billion is expected by 2026. It includes plans for $1 billion each in 2025 and 2026, followed by $2 billion in 2026 related to an expected joint venture to create electrical architecture and software technology, according to a release by the automakers Tuesday.

Shares of Rivian soared more than 50% during after-hours trading Tuesday, two days ahead of an investor event for Rivian, which has been under pressure from Wall Street due to its cash burn and significant losses. Rivian stock closed Tuesday at $11.96 a share, down roughly 49% in 2024.

The initial $1 billion from Volkswagen will be in the form of a convertible note, which could be converted to Rivian shares on or after Dec. 1, the release said.

The deal will help Rivian on its journey to become cash flow-positive, Rivian CEO and founder RJ Scaringe said Tuesday night during an investor call.

He noted the capital is expected to carry the company through the production ramp-up of its smaller R2 SUVs at its plant in Normal, Illinois, starting in 2026, as well as production of the midsize EV platform at a plant in Georgia, where Rivian paused construction earlier this year.","Volkswagen Group plans to invest up to $5 billion in electric vehicle startup Rivian , starting with an initial investment of $1 billion.

CNBC,https://www.cnbc.com/2024/06/25/fedex-fdx-earnings-q4-2024.html,2024-06-25,22:54:46 UTC,FedEx shares jump after hours as massive cost-cutting measures kick in,"FedEx shares soared more than 15% after hours Tuesday after the company reported results that topped analysts' estimates in both earnings and revenue.

Here's how the company did in its fiscal fourth quarter compared with what Wall Street was anticipating, based on a survey of analysts by LSEG:

Earnings per share : $5.41 adjusted vs. $5.35 expected

: $5.41 adjusted vs. $5.35 expected Revenue: $22.11 billion vs. $22.07 billion expected

The company reported net income for the three-month period that ended May 31 of $1.47 billion, or $5.94 per share, compared with $1.54 billion, or $6.05 per share, a year earlier.

Revenue rose to $22.1 billion, up slightly from $21.9 billion a year earlier. For the full fiscal year, revenue was $87.7 billion, down from $90.2 billion.

FedEx reported that capital spending for fiscal 2024 was $5.2 billion, down 16% from $6.2 billion in fiscal 2023 and less than the $5.7 billion it forecasted in its fiscal 2024 guidance last year.

For fiscal 2025, the company said it expects low to mid-single-digit revenue growth year over year, driven in large part by e-commerce and low-inventory levels, FedEx Chief Customer Officer Brie Carere said on the company's earnings call.

""We think e-commerce is going to outpace the B2B growth,"" Carere said. ""We like the fundamentals from an e-commerce perspective that will help us here in the United States and around the world.""

The capital spending decline comes as the company amps up its cost-cutting measures as part of a sweeping commitment to cut $4 billion by the end of fiscal 2025.

Following weak freight demand, FedEx enacted its DRIVE transformation program to cut costs and consolidate the business.

""DRIVE continues to change the way we work at FedEx. We achieved our target of $1.8 billion in structural costs out in fiscal year '24,"" CEO Raj Subramaniam said on the call.

Subramaniam said the company is firmly on track to achieve the $4 billion cost-cutting goal and further expects another $2 billion from the company's plans to consolidate its air and ground services.

As part of the DRIVE initiative, FedEx announced in April 2023 that it will be consolidating its delivery companies Express, Ground, Services and others into a unified Federal Express Corporation, operating under the FedEx brand and alongside the company's Freight segment which will continue to exist separately. The company said at the time that it expects the combined delivery business to handle all deliveries starting June 2024.

The newly combined segments are expected to be the larger driver of fiscal year 2025 adjusted income and margin improvement, finance chief John Dietrich said on the call.

FedEx further expects the demand environment to moderately improve through the next fiscal year, according to Carere.

Investor's eyes are also on the company's largest segment Express, which has been struggling with margin growth the past year. The segment's margins ended the fourth quarter at 4.1%, unchanged year over year. Its operating margin for fiscal 2024 was 2.6%, up slightly from 2.5% last year.

Subramaniam said improving performance of the Express segment is a ""top priority"" for the company.

While the company hiked its quarterly dividend by 10% earlier this month, investors do foresee headwinds, particularly after the company lost its U.S. Postal Service contract to rival United Parcel Service n April.

UPS will become the primary air cargo provider for USPS starting Sept. 30, after FedEx's contract expires. USPS was the largest customer for the company's Express segment. The company shared that it expects a $500 million headwind from the loss in fiscal 2025.","FedEx shares soared more than 15% after hours Tuesday after the company reported results that topped analysts' estimates in both earnings and revenue.

The stock pared losses slightly to trade down 13% by 9:00 a.m. London time.

The world's second largest retailer said operating profit for the period between March and May came in at 7.1 billion Swedish kroner ($672 million), below the 7.37 billion Swedish kroner anticipated by analysts, according to an LSEG poll cited by Reuters.

The second-quarter result was nevertheless above the 4.7 billion Swedish kroner recorded in the same period last year.

The company also said that bad weather was likely to dampen sales in June, which it expects to decline by 6% in local currencies, compared with the same period of last year.

Further weighing on stock, H&M CEO Daniel Ervér cast doubt over the company's ability to meet its margin target this year.

""Our goal of an operating margin of 10 percent for full-year 2024 remains in place,"" he said. ""However, the conditions for achieving that level this year have become more challenging as it is assessed that external factors that influence our purchasing costs and sales revenues, including materials and foreign currency, will have a more negative impact than we expected in the second half of the year.""

He added that the company was continuing to invest in both its online and in store experiences, with upgrades to stores in Paris, Milan, Berlin, Stockholm, Hamburg and Munich to follow those already undertaken in New York, London and Tokyo.

It comes as higher living costs and a slowdown in post-pandemic spending have weighed on both high street and luxury retail sales.

Earlier this month, Zara owner Inditex reported a slowdown in first-quarter sales compared to the previous year's growth, but pointed to an uptick in May.

Meanwhile, Chinese-founded fast fashion giant Shein has been encroaching on European retailers, as it prepares for a public listing in London.","Shares of H&M plunged more than 14% on Thursday morning after the company reported a smaller-than-expected increase in second-quarter profits and cast doubt over its June sales and full-year profit margin target.

CNBC,https://www.cnbc.com/2024/06/26/micron-shares-slide-after-revenue-forecast-fails-to-top-estimates.html,2024-06-26,22:51:00 UTC,Micron shares slide after revenue forecast fails to top estimates,"Sanjay Mehrotra, Micron Technology President & CEO at the WEF in Davos, Switzerland on May 24th, 2022.

Micron shares fell about 7% in extended trading on Wednesday as investors looked past better-than-expected results and focused instead on a revenue forecast that was in line with estimates.

Here's how the company did versus LSEG consensus estimates for the fiscal third quarter ended May 30:

Earnings per share : 62 cents adjusted vs. 51 cents expected

: 62 cents adjusted vs. 51 cents expected Revenue: $6.81 billion vs. $6.67 billion expected

Micron, which makes computer memory and storage, said it expects adjusted earnings per share of $1.08 on revenue of $7.6 billion in the current quarter. Analysts were expecting earnings per share of $1.05 on revenue of $7.6 billion.

The shares have more than doubled in the past year as the company rides the artificial intelligence boom. Micron's most advanced memory is needed for AI graphics processing units (GPUs) like Nvidia's , putting the company in position to benefit from demand for technology to train and deploy AI applications like OpenAI's ChatGPT.

Micron reported $332 million in net income, or 30 cents per share, versus a net loss of $1.9 billion, or $1.73 per share, in the year-ago quarter.

Micron CEO Sanjay Mehrotra highlighted the company's AI business in a statement while saying that its smartphone and PC markets remain sluggish.

Mehrotra said the company's AI-oriented products were likely to increase in price and that the company's data center business grew 50% on a quarter-to-quarter basis.

""Robust AI-driven demand for data center products is causing tightness on our leading-edge nodes,"" Mehrotra said in a statement. ""Consequently, we expect continued price increases throughout calendar 2024 despite only steady near-term demand in PCs and smartphones.""

On a call with analysts, Micron said that its high bandwidth memory, the kind used in AI chips, is sold out through 2025.

""We believe that Micron will be one of the biggest beneficiaries in the semiconductor industry in the multiyear growth opportunity driven by AI,"" Mehrotra said.

In a lyric on her latest album, Beyoncé sings ""denim on denim, on denim, on denim."" Levi Strauss shoppers are taking that advice to heart. Levi Strauss executives are ecstatic. Western wear is booming as consumers opt for top-to-bottom denim looks, the iconic, 171-year-old clothing maker said on Wednesday. As the style wins cultural favor, its popularity is juicing denim niches — like shirts, skirts and dresses — that fall outside Levi's widely-known blue jean offerings. ""The growing popularity of Western wear is at an all-time high,"" CEO Michelle Gass told analysts Wednesday night after the California-based retailer's latest earnings report for the quarter ended in May. A Western renaissance has been gaining traction over the past several months, sending stylish shoppers searching for pieces like jeans, boots and cowboy hats. Levi's scored a huge hit when its jean brand was referenced in Beyoncé's song ""Levii's Jeans,"" released earlier this year. Beyond Beyoncé's chart-topping ""Cowboy Carter"" album, the increased ubiquity of Western style has also been tied to a fashion line unveiled by Louis Vuitton earlier this year and Taylor Swift's ongoing Eras Tour.

Gass, who took over as Levi Strauss CEO earlier this year after previously serving as the CEO at Kohl's , has touted that denim is having a moment in the popular imagination, with Western wear trending more broadly throughout the culture. More specific data shared on the company's earnings call Wednesday showed how Levi Strauss is taking advantage of demand for denim beyond its popular ""501"" jeans. Sales of denim skirts, jumpsuits and dresses all at least doubled in the latest quarter, Gass said. Western shirts sales are also up significantly, she said, especially on the women's side. Levi is find success in what the 55-year-old chief executive described as a new strategy of trying to dress customers denim — from head-to-toe. ""Our new focus is, yes, continuing to own jeans, but taking that denim top to bottom,"" Gass said on CNBC's ""Mad Money"" late Wednesday. While noting that the denim skirt and dress categories haven't been historically large for the company, now ""they're exploding,"" she said.

Denim rage sets a high bar on Wall Street

To be sure, the well-documented denim craze alone isn't necessarily impressing Wall Street. Levi Strauss tumbled more than 15% on Thursday in response to its latest numbers, its second worst day since going public in early 2019. Levi Strauss posted $1.44 billion in revenue in the fiscal second quarter, slightly missing the $1.45 billion consensus forecast of analysts polled by LSEG despite the denim boom. The company's finance chief told CNBC that the sales miss was driven by unfavorable foreign exchange rates and weakness in the Dockers brand. On the other hand, Levi Strauss earned 16 cents per share, excluding items, ahead of the 11-cent average estimate by analysts. In the year through Wednesday, shares had run up amid the buzz around the cotton-based fabric and the resurgence of Western clothing. Following Thursday's drop, the stock is still up more than 18% on the year. For comparison, shares of Kontoor Brands , the parent of denim brands Wrangler and Lee, have risen 5% year to date.

CNBC,https://www.cnbc.com/2024/06/27/theres-a-big-fed-inflation-reading-coming-friday-heres-what-to-expect.html,2024-06-28,10:56:54 UTC,There's a big Fed inflation reading coming Friday. Here's what to expect,"People purchase beverages in a store on a sweltering afternoon in Brooklyn, New York, on the first day of summer on June 21, 2024.

The official Dow Jones forecasts for Friday's numbers are for the headline, or all-item, PCE price reading to come in flat on the month, while core is projected to rise 0.1%. That would compare to respective increases of 0.3% and 0.2% in April . Both headline and core are forecast at 2.6% on a year-over-year basis.

If that date rings a bell, it's when core PCE first passed the Fed's coveted 2% inflation target during this cycle. Despite a series of aggressive interest rate increases since then, the central bank has yet to wrest the pace of price increases back into its target range.

But even more importantly, when stripping out volatile food and energy prices, the core PCE price index, which draws even closer scrutiny from Fed policymakers, is set to indicate its lowest annual reading since March 2021.

The personal consumption expenditures price index, an inflation measure the Federal Reserve watches closely, is expected to show little, if any, monthly increase for May, the first time that would be the case since November 2023.

There could be some pretty good inflation news on the way from the Commerce Department when it releases a key economic report Friday.

Should the core PCE price forecasts transpire, it will serve as a milestone of sorts.

""We are in line with [the forecast] that the PCE core pricing data will come in soft,"" said Beth Ann Bovino, chief economist at U.S. Bank. ""That's good news for the Fed. It's also good for people's pocketbooks, although I don't know if people feel it just yet.""

Indeed, while the rate of inflation has receded precipitously from its mid-2022 peak, prices have not. Since that March 2021 benchmark, core PCE is up 14%.

That steep climb and its pernicious effect is why Fed officials are not ready to declare victory yet, despite the obvious progress made since the rate hikes began in March 2022.

""Returning inflation sustainably to our 2% target is an ongoing process and not a fait accompli,"" Fed Governor Lisa Cook said earlier this week.

Cook and her colleagues have been circumspect about the timing and pace of rate cuts, though most agree that easing is likely at some point this year as long as the data stays in line. Futures markets are currently pricing in a good likelihood that the Fed will enact its first quarter-percentage-point cut in September, with another to follow by the end of the year. Policymakers at their meeting earlier this month penciled in just one cut.

""We do expect softening in the real economy — not falling off a cliff, just softening — that suggests that inflation will be softer as well later on. That gives us reason to expect the Fed will be able to likely have their first cut in September,"" Bovino said.

""Now we all know it depends on the data and the Fed is still watching,"" she added. ""Could they wait? Could it just be a one and done this year? I can't rule it out. But it does look like the numbers might give the Fed cover to cut rates two times this year.""

In addition to the inflation numbers, the Commerce Department at 8:30 a.m. ET will release figures on personal income and consumer spending, with estimates at a rise of 0.4% and 0.3%, respectively.","If that date rings a bell, it's when core PCE first passed the Fed's coveted 2% inflation target during this cycle.

The annual survey conducted by the China General Chamber of Commerce in the U.S. found that nearly 60% of companies aim to maintain a stable level of investment and that about 30% plan to boost it.

""A notable degree of long-term optimism persisted, with the majority expressing positive future revenue expectations,"" CGCC said, adding that the survey reflected ""a commendable sense of optimism, determination, and resilience.""

The survey was conducted in April and May of this year, polling nearly 100 Chinese companies across various industries about performance and outlook.

The report said Chinese firms remain committed to the U.S. market despite growing negative sentiment about the overall business environment amid rising trade tensions between the world's two largest economies.

Over 60% of survey respondents saw a deteriorating business environment in the U.S. Meanwhile, the rate of concern regarding a ""stalemate in Sino-US bilateral relations political and cultural relations"" surged to 93% from 81% a year prior.

Over the past year, the Biden administration has ramped up curbs on Chinese businesses, scrutinizing certain China-dominated industries, placing new sanctions on various Chinese firms and goods and trying to outright block Chinese ownership of certain companies and platforms.","A recent survey of Chinese enterprises in the U.S. has found that a majority remain bullish on the market long term despite growing concerns about U.S.-China relations and the broader business environment.

CNBC,https://www.cnbc.com/2024/06/25/fed-governor-bowman-says-shes-still-open-to-raising-rates-if-inflation-doesnt-improve.html,2024-06-25,16:07:05 UTC,Fed Governor Bowman says she's still open to raising rates if inflation doesn't improve,"Michelle Bowman, governor of the US Federal Reserve, speaks during the Exchequer Club meeting in Washington, DC, US, on Wednesday, Feb. 21, 2024.

Federal Reserve Governor Michelle Bowman said Tuesday the time is not right yet to start lowering interest rates, adding she would be open to raising if inflation doesn't pull back.

""Should the incoming data indicate that inflation is moving sustainably toward our 2 percent goal, it will eventually become appropriate to gradually lower the federal funds rate to prevent monetary policy from becoming overly restrictive,"" Bowman said in prepared remarks for a speech in London. ""However, we are still not yet at the point where it is appropriate to lower the policy rate.""

Those comments reflect a prevailing sentiment at the central bank, in which most policymakers have said in recent weeks that, while they still expect inflation to get back to the Fed's 2% target, they need more evidence.

Recent readings have shown moderating inflation, with the Fed's preferred indicator running just under 3%. However, the rate-setting Federal Open Market Committee noted after its last meeting that there has been only ""modest further progress.""

Bowman noted that there are ""a number of upside risks"" prevailing that could accelerate her outlook, which is among the most hawkish of all policymakers.

""I remain willing to raise the target range for the federal funds rate at a future meeting should progress on inflation stall or even reverse,"" she said. ""Given the risks and uncertainties regarding my economic outlook, I will remain cautious in my approach to considering future changes in the stance of policy.""

The Commerce Department on Friday will release its reading on the May personal consumption expenditures price index, the Fed's preferred inflation gauge. Economists surveyed by Dow Jones expect a 12-month inflation rate of 2.6% on both the all-items and core, which excludes food and energy prices.

While that would represent a nudge lower from April, Bowman said she still expects the Fed to hold its key overnight borrowing rate in a range between 5.25%-5.50% ""for some time.""

Moreover, she indicated she is not being swayed by rate reductions from the Fed's global counterparts such as the European Central Bank, which recently lowered its key rates by a quarter percentage point. Bowman said ""it is possible over the coming months that the path of monetary policy in the U.S. will diverge from that of other advanced economies.""

In other Fed news Tuesday, Governor Lisa Cook expressed optimism that inflation would show more significant progress in 2025, allowing the Fed to lower rates at some point.

""With significant progress on inflation and the labor market cooling gradually, at some point it will be appropriate to reduce the level of policy restriction to maintain a healthy balance in the economy,"" Cook told the Economic Club of New York.

While Cook said she is optimistic that inflation will head lower and supply and demand in the labor market is coming into better balance, she also noted that risk factors remain. They include higher credit card delinquency rates and tighter credit conditions, along with the difficulty in assessing economic data that has come under continuous and significant revision.

Both officials' remarks follow other policymakers saying Monday that they're hesitant to cut.

San Francisco Fed President Mary Daly rejected the idea of doing a preemptive cut to hedge against deterioration in the labor market and a slowing economy.

""I do think that preemptive cutting is something that you do when you see risks,"" Daly told CNBC's Deirdre Bosa during a public event in San Francisco. ""We're going to be resolute until we finish the job. That's why not taking preemptive action when it's not necessary is so important.""

Also, Chicago Fed President Austan Goolsbee told CNBC's Steve Liesman earlier on Monday that if he sees ""more months"" of good inflation data, then he would question whether policy needs to be as restrictive as it has been, paving the way for cuts.

As governors, Cook and Bowman are permanent FOMC voters. Daly also gets a vote this year while Goolsbee does not, though he does get a voice at meetings and submits his forecast to the committee's

CNBC,https://www.cnbc.com/2024/06/29/two-paths-for-jana-to-bolster-shareholder-value-at-rapid7.html,2024-06-29,11:55:40 UTC,Activist Jana has a stake in Rapid7. There are two paths to bolster value at the cybersecurity company,"Business: Rapid7 is a global cybersecurity software and services provider. Its products span across information security, cloud operations, development and information technology teams, enabling them to understand attackers and leverage that information to take control of their fragmented attack surface. Rapid7 Managed Threat Complete is the company's flagship offering, and it includes the Rapid7 Managed Detection and Response program. Rapid7 also provides risk and threat coverage through InsightIDR and Insight VM services, making them available in a single package. Its security solutions help more than 11,000 global customers unite cloud risk management and threat detection.

Activist Commentary: Jana is a very experienced activist investor founded in 2001 by Barry Rosenstein. The firm made its name taking deeply researched activist positions with well-conceived plans for long term value. Rosenstein called his activist strategy ""V cubed."" The three ""Vs"" were"" (i) Value: buying at the right price; (ii) Votes: knowing whether you have the votes before commencing a proxy fight; and (iii) Variety of ways to win: having more than one strategy to enhance value and exit an investment. Since 2008, the firm has gradually shifted that strategy to one which we characterize as the three ""Ss"" (i) Stock price: buying at the right price; (ii) Strategic activism: sale of company or spinoff of a business; and (iii) Star advisors/nominees: aligning with top industry executives to advise them and take board seats if necessary.

Rapid7 is a cybersecurity company that expands the expertise of its clients' security operations. Its Managed Threat Complete flagship offering combines end-to-end 24/7 managed detection and response with vulnerability management offerings. Historically, the company has focused on on-site cybersecurity operations, but it has begun to expand into the explosive growth area of cloud security. Rapid7 operates in a highly attractive industry and is the beneficiary of some meaningful tailwinds. In a time where software budgets are being cut or reallocated toward AI, the threat of cyberattacks looms large and presents a great enough risk that spend is either flat or increasing for these types of services. In addition, cybersecurity analysts and internal security staff are limited, so there is a tremendous need for outsourcing. With more complex operations and numerous applications both on-site and in the cloud, Rapid7 is well-positioned to continue growing and aims to be a high-quality provider for subject matter experts who may not be able to retain the services of their largest and most expensive competitors.

Despite its favorable position, the company has delivered negative returns on a one-, three-, and five-year basis. Rapid7 is one of three main players in vulnerability management, yet it's assigned a much smaller revenue multiple (3x) compared to peers Tenable (5.5x) and Qualys (8x). One factor in this is that Rapid7 offers a combination of low- and high-growth cybersecurity offerings, which is difficult to value, but more important are the multiple slip-ups by management, exacerbated by a lack of oversight by the board. First, the company has undergone changes to its sales model, including a shift to selling packaged products from selling offerings individually. It's also moved to a channel model from direct. Next, the company has encountered challenges in bringing its cloud product to market. In addition, to shift from pure growth to a profitable software company, Rapid7 has focused on meeting targets for $160 million in free cash flow and improved margins. In August 2023, likely in pursuit of these goals, the company abruptly announced plans to reduce its staff by 18%. Rapid7 has had further retention problems in key executive roles, including the departure of its chief innovation officer and its critically important chief operating officer and president. Finally, the company has not been able to properly make forecasts, leading to tremendous investor uncertainty and questions of board oversight. In February 2024, the company announced its 2024 guidance, which it stated it was highly confident in, only to cut it in May when the company delivered its Q1 results. That led to a 17% stock price decline on May 8. This is a company operating in a highly complex and dynamic space – it is doing everything all at once and has seemingly failed to deliver.

With a company like this, there are generally two paths to shareholder value creation: (i) a long-term plan involving board reconstitution, management overhaul and review of strategic and operational plans and (ii) a shorter-term plan to sell the company to an interested buyer who can make those changes. With respect to the long-term plan, Jana generally works with industry executives and consultants in performing due diligence and implementing its activist plans, and we do not expect this situation to be different. The firm will often bring these individuals to the table to serve as director nominees, if deemed necessary. Jana is experienced in getting these experts on company boards, where they often serve as assets in getting the company to correct its issues, from operational to governance to capital allocation. But Jana also has extensive experience in strategic activism and getting portfolio companies sold. We expect that Jana will advocate for the strategy it expects will maximize shareholder value on a risk- and time-adjusted basis. Given the problems the company has been experiencing and the lack of CEO focus (Aside from being chairman and CEO of Rapid7, Corey Thomas is on the National Security Telecommunications Advisory Committee, chair of the Federal Reserve Bank of Boston and a member of the Council on Foreign Relations. He also serves on the boards of the Blue Cross Blue Shield of Massachusetts, LPL Financial and Vanderbilt University.), a sale looks like it could be the easier and more certain path if there is a suitor at the right price.

Given industry tailwinds, there may be several strategic and financial buyers interested in this company. Recent transactions in the cybersecurity sector include Cisco's $28 billion takeover of Splunk and Francisco Partners' $1.7 billion acquisition of Sumo Logic. If Jana does advocate for a sale of Rapid7, it will ask the board to do it through a full sales process that attains the highest value for shareholders. In addition, Jana has a strategic partnership with Cannae Holdings, which could be helpful in providing the equity in a strategic transaction with a private equity firm. Consider that in 2019, Cannae joined with private-equity firms to buy Dun & Bradstreet. It is important to note that even if Jana thinks a sale of the company is the best way to optimize shareholder value, the firm will still have to get the board to agree. This does not look like a board and management team that will just go quietly. In such a case, Jana's remedy would be to launch a proxy fight, but that could take some time. The 2024 annual meeting just passed on June 13 and the director nomination window does not open until Feb.13, 2025.

“Anthem of Grace” kicked off with a massive global broadcast on Good Friday, hitting tens of millions of people with the Gospel. Translated into 60 languages, millions more are still consuming the content in nations across the world months after the event was first aired.

“It’s been amazing to see what God is doing,” Hall, founder of the Pulse Movement, told CBN News. “And I think we all know this, but … there’s a revival spreading. There’s joy, there’s hope.”

The evangelist said the Anthem of Grace campaign centers, in part, on “Amazing Grace,” the “most sung and most translated hymn ever.” Beyond that, he said the campaign seeks to focus on the power of the Gospel to change hearts and minds.

“[It also focuses on the] story of every believer whose life has been changed by this and trying to tell the story of God’s grace in our lives, and welcoming people into that anthem of grace,” Hall said.

The faith leader said the mission of highlighting the change God has made in people’s lives and helping others discover the same transformation in their own journeys is the pinnacle of the campaign.

“It’s just incredible to see the hunger, and we’re really just trying to see a global movement of just pointing back to the grace of God,” Hall said. “And, hopefully, equipping as many believers as possible to share that story of how God’s changed them.”

Hall said he is humbled to see how God has used his ministry to reach so many hearts.

“This is amazing. … I’ve got three kids, I’m in a ministry now 20 plus years,” he said. “And I’m just incredibly humbled and incredibly thankful to still be following Jesus. I’m thankful to be more in love with Jesus than I’ve ever been.”

At the end of the year, Hall said he hopes “Anthem of Grace” helps light a fire in the hearts of people who have not yet encountered the Lord.

“In my heart and talking to so many believers … I just believe Jesus is coming soon … I just go to, you know, ‘How do we see as many people as possible hear the Gospel and know the Gospel?'”

Hall continued, “Because we know that … the Word promises things, right? The Word’s going to go to the ends of the Earth and then Christ is going to return.”

The preacher offered a reminder of what the Bible says about the end of days, noting how Jesus proclaims there will be “wars, and rumors and wars” and other happenings. Every generation since Christ has awaited His return, but Hall said world conditions right now make it feel more impending.

“It does seem like there’s a quickening around the world,” he said. “And I think what we’re seeing is that the dark is getting darker and the evil is getting greater. And, with that, the light is seeing brighter.”

Hall wants every person who claims to know Jesus to “testify to the goodness of God” — something he believes would immediately transform global circumstances.

“It would change the world overnight … just the testimony of the saints,” Hall said. “Even in Revelation, it says, ‘We’re going to overcome by the blood of the lamb and the word of their testimony.'”

Thus, he hopes people’s testimonies make a massive difference by proving the Gospel’s power and sway to a watching world.","Evangelist Nick Hall is in the midst of yet another monumental, year-long evangelism campaign — and he believes hearts and souls are being transformed.

Hengaw, an organization reporting on human rights violations against Kurds in Iran, stated there has been no reason given for the charges against the five Christians.

Listen to the latest episode of “Quick Start”

Hamid Afzali was sentenced to 10 years behind bars, followed by Nasrollah Mousavi, Bijan Gholizadeh, and Iman Salehi, each of whom were sentenced to five years, and Zohrab Shahbazi, who received a nine-month jail sentence, The Jerusalem Post reported.

In a statement to CBN News, Todd Nettleton, vice president of message for the Voice of the Martyrs, said, “The growth of the church in Iran is wonderful news for Christians around the world, and a great reminder of God’s ability to grow His church in spite of anything that any government might do to stop it.”

“But the high price our Iranian brothers and sisters are paying to follow Christ is a different kind of reminder: to pray often for them as they willingly suffer for the name of Christ,” he added.

The report from Hengaw noted that, while Christians are “acknowledged as a religious minority in Iran, authorities impose severe penalties, especially on those who convert from Islam to Christianity.”

Iran’s decision to imprison the five Christian converts violates article 18 of the United Nations’ International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, which states, “Everyone shall have the right to freedom of thought, conscience and religion. This right shall include freedom to have or to adopt a religion or belief of his choice, and freedom, either individually or in community with others and in public or private, to manifest his religion or belief in worship, observance, practice, and teaching.”

In addition to these five Christian arrests, Hengaw noted that another recent Christian convert in Iran, Yasin Mousavi, has been sentenced to 15 years in prison for charges including “membership in groups or associations aimed at disrupting security” and “propaganda against the government through promoting Christianity.”

OpenDoors.org, which tracks Christian persecution around the globe, has placed Iran at No. 9 on its World Watch List and rates the persecution Christians face in the Muslim-ruled country as “extreme.”

“For Christians who convert from Islam, not even the veneer of tolerance is present. Conversion from Islam to Christianity is illegal in Iran, and anyone caught as a convert can be arrested and imprisoned,” the organization explained in part. “The government views conversion as an attempt by the West to undermine Islam and the Islamic government of Iran. This means that anyone who is discovered to be a member of a house church can be charged with a crime against national security, which can lead to long prison sentences.”

Please be in prayer for our brothers and sisters in Christ facing persecution in Iran.","Five converts to Christianity have been sentenced by the Iranian judiciary to a collective of more than 25 years in prison, according to a report from Iran International.

Now, it's on a mission to build 40 more megachurches in the next 10 years.

Most roads in Hyderabad on Sundays lead to Calvary Temple. Shortly after 4 a.m., side streets around the church here are already jammed.

As church volunteers coordinate traffic, shuttle buses, auto rickshaws, and motorcycles ferry thousands of people, all trying to get here two hours ahead of Calvary's first of five services that begin at 6 a.m.

By sunrise, the faithful have taken their seats.

The main sanctuary holds 18,000 people supported by adjacent Bethlehem Hall with 15,000 and a third structure accommodating more than 3,000 more.

Hundreds more watch on television screens scattered around the sprawling Calvary campus.

Pastor Satish Kumar preaches all five services with the last one ending at 8 p.m.

""I've been given the grace to pastor this church which is beyond my dream and imagination,"" Pastor Kumar told CBN News.

Calvary Temple started in 2005 with about two dozen people. Today, it boasts more than 300,000 members making it one of the largest churches in the world.

They have 11 satellite churches with plans for more nationwide expansion.

""God put a burden in my heart to establish 40 mega churches just like what you see here during the next 10 years,"" said Kumar.

Pastor Kumar says the church adds some 3,000 new believers each month in a sign that the Lord is moving mightily across the country.

""God's hand is upon India, it's a time for India to reach the lost, not only within the country but across the globe,"" Kumar said.

In addition, the church produces over 650 TV programs each month in 17 of the country's major languages for broadcast on national television.

""It's not only within the nation, but also in Bangladesh, Nepal, Sri Lanka, Afghanistan, Pakistan and Gulf countries,"" said Kumar.

Millions more follow on social media. The reason for the church's success?

""Preaching the pure Word of God is what attracts people, and practicing the Word of God is what keeps people within the church,"" said Kumar.

That practical demonstration is on full display here each Sunday.

Narayana Podhili works as a civil engineer during the week. On Sunday, he leads an army of 150 church volunteers who spend hours chopping, slicing, peeling, and stirring – all to prepare free breakfast, lunch, and dinner meals for 50,000 people.

""We are committed to come here every Sunday at 3:30 a.m., 4 a.m., and we keep working till evening,"" Podhili told CBN News as he marshaled his forces.

Nagavalli Mendem has served in the Calvary kitchen for seven years after making a promise to God that if He healed her cancerous tumor, she would serve the church in this capacity.

""Because I made that promise, God healed me completely without surgery,"" Mendem said. ""God cleared the tumor in my chest and healed me. As a thanksgiving to Him, I serve here at the Lord's house.""

She and volunteers feed more than 200,000 people each month.

""In India, we say, 'service to mankind is service to God' so that is what we try to practice,"" Kumar said. ""We try to show God's love in action in every possible way that we find.""

Calvary also has an on-campus hospital where members get free medical treatment on Sundays and medicines at reduced cost.

""The majority of the people who come here are poor and cannot afford treatment,"" said Dr. Vinod Kumar of Calvary Hospital.

Members also have access to church facilities to hold marriages. And when a church member passes away, Calvary handles all funeral, burial, and meal arrangements – again, all for free.

In 2007, Calvary Temple created an access card system, the first of its kind, to follow up with members and their families.

""I have thousands of people. How do I know who hasn't shown up on a Sunday? As I was praying God put access card into my mind,"" Kumar said.

Each member must swipe their card when attending any one of the five Sunday services.

""Without fail, if we don't show up to church, we get a call,"" said Chandraiah, a Calvary Temple member. ""They'll ask me why I didn't come to church and after they find out they will pray for me. I'm happy when I receive that call. Not only that, but the fact also that they care for us is special, and because of that we will surely come to the next service.""

Pastor Kumar says prayer has always been an integral part of their success. The church has held 40 days of prayer and fasting regularly since 2005 drawing tens of thousands of young participants to stadiums around the country.

""During this 40 days of fasting and prayer, I teach from Genesis to Revelation,"" Kumar told CBN News. ""Every book I try to explain. Hundreds of thousands of young kids end up reading the whole Bible.""

Each month, the church, along with its satellite campuses, holds a ""Night with God"" as members pray for revival.

""About 25,000 to 30,000 people join. That has been the biggest, largest all-night prayer services in our nation,"" Kumar said.

In recent years, however, India has witnessed an unprecedented uptick in violence against Christians.

""The more the persecution, the more the church grows and that's what's happening in India,"" Kumar said.

Most attacks are carried out by Hindu extremist groups who accuse Christians of forcibly converting people to Christianity.

Pastor Kumar, a Hindu convert to Christianity himself, says resistance produces power.

""No persecution has ever succeeded in stopping the preaching of the Word of God, it always promoted the Word of God and spread the Word of God across the countries,"" said Kumar. ""It's my passion, my burden that before I die, I want to see every Indian will hear the gospel and know the Savior.""

Oklahoma's top education official ordered public schools to incorporate the Bible into lessons for grades five through 12 this week.

State school superintendent Ryan Walters says his mandate is compulsory and “immediate and strict compliance is expected.”

He points out that since the Bible's influence on America and Western civilization has been foundational, students need to be educated about its role in U.S. and world history.

""The Bible is an indispensable historical and cultural touchstone,"" Walters said. ""Without basic knowledge of it, Oklahoma students are unable to properly contextualize the foundation of our nation which is why Oklahoma educational standards provide for its instruction.""

Walters has previously noted that America is in a culture war and he doesn't want “woke ideology” spread by the state's public schools.

Left-wing groups have predictably threatened legal action calling the state school superintendent's move a violation of the U.S. Constitution. “Public schools are not Sunday schools,” said Rachel Laser, president and CEO of Americans United for Separation of Church and State.

Oklahoma law explicitly allows Bibles in the classroom and lets teachers use them in instruction.

But earlier this week the Oklahoma Supreme Court blocked the state's attempt to launch the first publicly funded religious charter school in the U.S.

He went on to condemn the modern political left as “aggressively anti-common sense” during an interview with English journalist Tina Brown at the Aspen Ideas Festival in Colorado.

“Part of it the left has to own,” he told Brown. “They are aggressively anti-common sense. The Democrats keep running on this one idea, saying to the American people, ‘You can’t possibly think you can do worse than Donald Trump.’ And they keep saying, ‘Yes, we can. Yes, we can.'”

Maher went on to explain he has Democratic friends who have leftist children, many of whom, the comedian suggested, accuse their parents of “old thinking” and not understanding their progressive points of view.

“Tear down statues of Lincoln? Maybe give communism another shot? Get rid of the border patrol? Get rid of capitalism? White supremacy has never been worse? Gender is always just a social construct? It’s OK to have penises in the women’s swimming pool, in women’s prisons?” he said, listing a handful of the views held by leftists. “No, it’s not that I’m old; it’s that your ideas are stupid.”

Listen to the latest episode of “Quick Start”:

Maher explained to Brown that, if Democrats insist on embracing far-leftist ideals and refuse to collaborate in any way with Republicans who oppose Trump, they are only aiding the GOP in defeating incumbent President Joe Biden.

“That’s as good as it gets,” he said. “If you can’t talk to those people, you’re just abandoning the country to half the people who are even worse, who are going to vote for Trump this next time — and they are — and he very likely will win, and then what are we going to do?”

“I think we should keep the dialogue open,” the HBO’s “Real Time” host added.

Maher recently appeared on the ABC talk show “The View,” where he condemned those on the left who have chosen to vehemently oppose Israel and protest in support of Hamas.

“If I had any doubt that I was right about the change that’s happened in the left, watching people protest for a terrorist organization like Hamas — that straightened me out pretty quick,” he said, later adding, “It’s astounding to me that they can’t tell the good guys from the bad guys, just morally. If you’re for Hamas, just live in Gaza for a day … [even] before the war.”

Ultimately, he said the best way to stop Israel from retaliating is to “stop attacking Israel.”

In what's widely known as the Chevron case, the court took a step to curb the ability of the ballooning federal bureaucracy to bypass Congress with backdoor regulations.

In the other case, the high court issued a ruling about obstruction that could have a big impact on the future of President Trump and Capitol riot defendants.

The Chevron Case & the 'Deep State'



In a far-reaching decision, the Supreme Court upended the 40-year-old Chevron precedent that made it easier for federal government agencies to create their own rules on issues like the environment, public health, and business regulations.

The original Chevron decision allowed federal agencies to unilaterally fill in the details whenever government officials claimed the laws passed by Congress were too ambiguous.

Critics have argued for decades that only Congress has been given the power to legislate, so allowing bureaucrats broad power to invent thousands of regulations violates the U.S. Constitution. It's one of the reasons those critics have referred to the massive size of the federal government as the ""nanny state"" or even the ""deep state"" because unelected bureaucrats often seized that opportunity to operate autonomously from the legislative or judicial branches.

THE CHEVRON CASE David v Goliath: Small Businesses Fight Federal Bureaucracy at US Supreme Court

BREAKING: In a major blow to the unelected administrative state, the Supreme Court has overruled the Chevron doctrine, which required courts to defer to the legal interpretations of unelected bureaucrats.



“Chevron is overruled.” pic.twitter.com/tqC5EYaUBl — Sean Davis (@seanmdav) June 28, 2024

Chief Justice John Roberts wrote the court's opinion stating, ""Perhaps most fundamentally, Chevron's presumption is misguided because agencies have no special competence in resolving statutory ambiguities. Courts do.""

Tyler O'Neil, managing editor of the Daily Signal, wrote on X, ""This is a huge step forward for holding the administrative state—and the deep state—accountable.""

The Capitol Riot and Obstruction

In the other major case, the Supreme Court made it harder to charge Capitol riot defendants with obstruction, a charge that also has been brought against former President Donald Trump.

In a 6-3 ruling, the court ruled that charging someone with obstructing an official proceeding must include proof that defendants tried to tamper with or destroy documents. Only some of the people who breached the Capitol on Jan. 6, 2021, fall into that category, so many of those cases are expected to be affected by reduced sentencing.

Liberty Counsel Founder and Chairman Mat Staver said, ""This new narrow interpretation will make it difficult for these indictments to stand.""

Chief Justice John Roberts wrote Friday's decision, joined by Justices Samuel Alito, Neil Gorsuch, Brett Kavanaugh, and Clarence Thomas, and by Biden nominee Justice Ketanji Brown Jackson.

It's unclear how the court's decision might affect the obstruction case by Special Counsel Jack Smith against Trump in Washington. But the high court is expected to release a separate decision Monday regarding presidential immunity, and that ruling will directly impact Smith's case.

The Capitol Riot and ObstructionIn the other major case, the Supreme Court made it harder to charge Capitol riot defendants with obstruction, a charge that also has been brought against former President Donald Trump.
It's unclear how the court's decision might affect the obstruction case by Special Counsel Jack Smith against Trump in Washington.","['supreme', 'capitol', 'cases', 'decision', 'unelected', 'major', 'court', 'overreach', 'chevron', 'courts', 'cracks', 'wrote', 'federal', 'case']",https://www2.cbn.com/sites/default/files/capitolbreachriot_hdv.jpg,True,suprem court issu two separ rule friday take direct aim power feder govern what wide known chevron case court took step curb abil balloon feder bureaucraci bypass congress backdoor regul case high court issu rule obstruct could big impact futur presid trump capitol riot defend chevron case deep state farreach decis suprem court upend yearold chevron preced made easier feder govern agenc creat rule issu like environ public health busi regul origin chevron decis allow feder agenc unilater fill detail whenev govern offici claim law pass congress ambigu critic argu decad congress given power legisl allow bureaucrat broad power invent thousand regul violat us constitut one reason critic refer massiv size feder govern nanni state even deep state unelect bureaucrat often seiz opportun oper autonom legisl judici branch chevron case david v goliath small busi fight feder bureaucraci us suprem court break major blow unelect administr state suprem court overrul chevron doctrin requir court defer legal interpret unelect bureaucrat `` chevron overrul '' pictwittercomtqceyaubl -- sean davi seanmdav june chief justic john robert wrote court opinion state perhap fundament chevron presumpt misguid agenc special compet resolv statutori ambigu court do tyler oneil manag editor daili signal wrote x this huge step forward hold administr state -- and deep state -- account capitol riot obstruct major case suprem court made harder charg capitol riot defend obstruct charg also brought former presid donald trump rule court rule charg someon obstruct offici proceed must includ proof defend tri tamper destroy document peopl breach capitol jan fall categori mani case expect affect reduc sentenc liberti counsel founder chairman mat staver said this new narrow interpret make difficult indict stand chief justic john robert wrote friday decis join justic samuel alito neil gorsuch brett kavanaugh clarenc thoma biden nomine justic ketanji brown jackson unclear court decis might affect obstruct case special counsel jack smith trump washington high court expect releas separ decis monday regard presidenti immun rule direct impact smith case pleas sign newslett download news app ensur keep receiv latest news

German-born Alexander Dietze learned about Germany’s history and the Holocaust in school, but it wasn't discussed at home. Raised in a secular household, he became a Christian in his early 20s.

Years later, an abrupt awakening came when his grandfather offered him Nazi SS medals as part of their family heritage. This moment spurred Alexander and his wife, Cäcilia, to found the ministry Back to Zion, dedicated to helping Holocaust survivors in Israel.

Each week, the Dietzes invite Holocaust survivors to their home, sharing their story, providing meals, singing Israeli songs in Hebrew, and gifting bouquets of flowers.

But the amount of firepower being assembled on Israel's northern border suggests that war could start any day now.

By the tens of thousands, Israeli troops continue gathering and preparing on that border with Lebanon. Their purpose is to stop Hezbollah terrorists who've been attacking northern Israel from Lebanon almost daily for months.

That's forced some 80,000 Israelis to flee their homes and empty out whole communities near the border. As Kiryat Shmona resident Yarden Haziza puts it, ""Living right now in Kiryat Shmona is very sad. The city is empty most of the time.""

Hezbollah hit the north with some 40 rockets on just Thursday alone. The terrorists say it was to avenge a number of recent Israeli air strikes on Hezbollah infrastructure and personnel.

'On the March to Conquer the Middle East'

As the war against Hamas grinds on in Gaza and tensions mount in the north, Israel's prime minister keeps trying to get the world to focus on the threat from Iran, the massive power behind both Hezbollah and Hamas. Benjamin Netanyahu insists Iran's jihadists have an evil goal.

He's warning Iran and its proxies are, as he put it, ""On the march to conquer the Middle East.""

Visiting the north this week, Israel's president complained the international community is doing little to stave off war. So Isaac Herzog said it shouldn't be surprised if, as he said, ""The situation spirals out of control.""

Exuberant Defiance of Terrorism

Even as Israel braces for what could be another massive and painful war, the Tribe of Nova came together in Tel Aviv Thursday in exuberant defiance of terrorism. They held their first mass concert since Hamas attacked their festival near Gaza on October 7th.

Nimrod Arnin's sister was among the more than 360 festival-goers killed there.

He told the concert crowd, “On that Saturday at the beginning of October, our light was put to the test - a test which in our worst nightmares we didn’t imagine we would have to pass. The ultimate darkness challenged the big light of the Tribe of Nova.""

The Thursday concert featured dozens of dancers on stage re-enacting the horror of that morning. And the crowd of tens of thousands all stood quiet in a long moment of silence commemorating all who were lost.

'We Will Dance Again!'

But the main message of the day wasn't at all somber. It was that Israelis will not let the terrorists steal away their lust for life, or their joy, or their dance.

As concert attendee Maxim Mileyev put it, ""Nothing can stop us from living our lives here in Israel. And nothing can stop us from keeping on dancing and living.”

Nimrod Arnin summed up what so many in the Tribe of Nova have come to know. He told the concert crowd, ""In a moment of enlightenment we realized what is going to be the essence of our life from now and on. We will dance again!""

The crowd cheered him...and danced for hours. They wanted to show that while Hamas worships death, Israelis embrace life...and life to the fullest.

Some are even calling for Biden to be replaced as the nominee.



Voters were also concerned by what they saw from the president as he struggled and stumbled throughout the evening.



Within the opening minutes, he flubbed a line saying, ""What I've been able to do with the Covid, excuse me, with, dealing with everything we have to do with, look, if we finally beat Medicare.""

Cognitive Concerns



It became clear to the former President's surrogates, that Biden was in trouble.

Rep. Elise Stefanik (R-NY) said, ""The Biden campaign said this would be the reset moment for Joe Biden's candidacy and what they saw, what the American people saw, was a weak, horrible president, who is the weakest president in our nation's history.""



Voter concerns about Biden's age and mental sharpness were on display during the 90-minute debate as the president struggled at times to answer questions.



Sen. Marco Rubio (R-FL) said, ""He repeated things that were not true and he also said things that, to be frank, there were times that I could not understand what he was saying.""



The showdown had Biden and Trump, the two oldest candidates to ever seek the White House, trading barbs on a number of topics.



On the Economy



""The only jobs he created are for illegal immigrants and bounce back jobs that bounce back from the Covid. He has not done a good job, he's done a poor job, and inflation is killing our country,"" Trump said.



On Abortion



""We are not for late-term abortion. Period. Period, period,"" Biden said.

Trump replied, ""Under Roe v Wade, you have late-term abortion. You can do whatever you want. Depending on the state, you can do whatever you want. We don't think that's a good thing. We think it's a radical thing. We think the Democrats are the radicals.""



On Immigration



Biden said, ""When he was president, he was taking separating babies from their mothers, put him in cages, making sure that the families were separated. That's not the way to go.""



Trump pushed back accusing Biden of putting in place weak border policies that make America unsafe.

""We have the largest number of terrorists coming into our country right now. All terrorists all over the world, not just in South America, all over the world. They come from the Middle East, everywhere, all over the world. That pouring in. And this guy just left it open.""

Biden's Poor Performance



The two also tackled wars in Ukraine and Gaza.



But by the end of the night, everyone was talking about President Biden's poor performance.

Michigan resident Rosanne Ponkowski said, ""I have dealt with people that have dementia before, and it's very obvious just from the look on his face, not understanding what's going on, the surprised and shocked look sometimes, the eyes, the very stiff face, the very stiff hands, they're all very prominent signs of what's going on.""

The White House tried to put a brave face on the evening telling reporters that Biden had a cold.



Surrogates like California Governor Gavin Newsom (D) attempted to side-step voter concerns that the president is too old.



CBN News directly asked Gov. Newsom, ""There's a lot of concern about the president's stamina and mental health. Are you concerned, 81 years old, are concerned about that going forward?"" Newsom replied, ""I'm worried about President Trump's stamina."" We followed up with, ""No, I'm talking about the president."" Newsom replied, ""No, I'm talking about President Trump as well.""



One top Biden donor reportedly called the president's performance disqualifying, telling Reuters that he expects Democrats will urge him to step aside ahead of the party's national convention in August.

Still, in a post-debate rally, Biden told supporters that he was confident he could win against Trump. ""Look, we're going to beat this guy. We need to beat this guy. And I need you in order to beat him. You're the people I've run for,"" Biden said.



Coming into the debate, Biden and Trump found themselves nearly tied in some national opinion polls. We'll see in the coming days whether this debate did anything to significantly change those dynamics. For now, though, the race is set to be decided here in Georgia and a handful of other key swing states like Wisconsin, Michigan, and Arizona. Meanwhile, voters there and across the country will get another look at the candidates on September 10th.","ATLANTA – Democrats are panicking over President Biden's shaky performance in last night's historic debate with former President Trump.

The hijab — the headscarf traditionally worn by many Middle East women — is becoming harder to spot in Iran these days.

For many Iranian women, the hijab has become a symbol of oppression. They're refusing to wear it, even under the threat of beatings and imprisonment.

Change is coming to the autocratic, saber-rattling Islamic Republic of Iran that Americans see on the news. And it's coming fast.

It's clearly visible on the streets of the capital Tehran in the wake of the mass protests that began in September 2022, following the death in police custody of Mahsa Amini, a 22-year-old woman who resisted wearing her hijab.

The raw emotion of the protests — including images of women publicly burning their hijabs — has evolved into a controlled expression of resoluteness and strength.

Explosive Yearning

The protests, known as the ""Women, Life, Freedom Movement"", burst the cork out of the bottle. The demonstrations, resulting in thousands of arrests and more than 500 deaths over several months, were an explosion of yearning for women's rights.

And the Iranian regime got the message loud and clear.

The protests cleared the fog and smoke between the demands of the people and the demands of the state. A clear line has been drawn. Both know what each other's demands are. The government has resumed its ""morality police"" project to force women to wear the hijab. But Iranian women are not backing off.

This movement continues to gather momentum.

Increasingly, Iranian men are showing broad support for women's rights and freedoms. They're recognizing core human rights that benefit the whole of society. This would have been unimaginable just a few years ago.

The change is not only social. It's religious, too.

Christians in Iran have long been subjected to persecution and even torture and death. Today, Iran has the third highest number of religious prisoners, with 347 citizens behind bars for their faith — and those are just ones we know about.

But most Iranians don't see Christians as ""the enemy"" anymore.

A generation ago, the idea of being an Iranian and a Christian was unthinkable, unforgivable even. Now it's accepted without a blink.

Yet the hardline regime still denies citizens the freedom to attend church or convert to Christianity. Officially, there isn't a single Farsi-speaking church in the entire nation of 90 million people.

Illegal house churches — believers secretly meeting in homes — are raided routinely by the police, their leaders interrogated and imprisoned.

A New Revolution

But new media platforms, including Zoom, Instagram, and WhatsApp, are revolutionizing church for Iran's ""isolated"" believers.

They're worshiping online in real-time with other isolated believers outside Iran in places such as Türkiye, building a sense of Christian unity in a region that's 97% non-Christian. Respected Iranian Bible teachers living in exile overseas teach and preach via Zoom and on-air via live broadcasts, encouraging and strengthening the underground church.

There's more to this new media revolution.

SAT-7, the multimedia ministry with which I serve in the Middle East, launched the first-ever Christian video-on-demand streaming service in the region, which is totally free to watch.

Social media, especially Instagram, allows us to connect directly with Iranians watching live programs on satellite television or on their phones and digital devices. Viewers, young and old, pepper us with questions about Jesus and Christianity.

A boy named Kaamran told us: ""The kids at school know I'm a Christian. They ask questions and I don't know how to answer. I pray for them. I really want the Lord's throne to be set up here in Iran.""

Change is coming to Iran. It's coming fast.

In fact, it's already here.

--- Reza Jafari, a native of Iran, is a presenter with Christian multimedia ministry SAT-7 based in the Middle East. He helped launch SAT-7's online Church for Kids in Iran and ""digital church"" for isolated believers who have no other way to attend church.","ANALYSIS: Change Is Coming to Iran, and It's Coming FastThe hijab — the headscarf traditionally worn by many Middle East women — is becoming harder to spot in Iran these days.

(AP Photo/Alex Brandon)

In one of the most eagerly anticipated opinions of this term, the U.S. Supreme Court has essentially decided to kick the can down the road on Idaho's abortion law.

The official release of the ruling comes a day after the decision was prematurely leaked by someone at the Supreme Court. It was published online briefly on Wednesday before being removed. A court spokeswoman said the post was a mistake.

The decision will allow emergency abortions for now in a procedural ruling that leaves key questions unanswered. For now, the Idaho case will continue to play out in lower courts, and could end up before the Supreme Court again.

Liberty Counsel Founder and Chairman Mat Staver explained, ""This order means that the case returns to the Ninth Circuit, which had ordered that the appeal of the preliminary injunction be decided by the full court on an expedited basis without any further briefing. The abortion ban currently remains in place in Idaho, except for those in emergency room situations.""

WATCH Our Analysis: Supreme Court Rules on Idaho Abortion Ban

What the Case Is Really About

The Biden administration had sued Idaho claiming the state's law violates a federal law called the Emergency Medical Treatment and Labor Act (EMTALA). The White House insists the EMTALA requires hospital emergency rooms to provide abortions to women if their general health is at risk. Idaho's law already provided an exception to save the life of the mother, so the case is seen as an effort to expand abortion access beyond that.

Idaho Solicitor General Joshua Turner suggested the Biden administration's ""health"" definition is too broad because it could be interpreted to include many non-life-threatening health concerns, including mental health.

And the Alliance Defending Freedom accused the Biden administration of trying to invent ""a federal abortion mandate by manipulating EMTALA.""

During the arguments at the court, Justice Samuel Alito said the EMTALA was not intended to include abortion because it specifically identifies unborn children as patients who should be cared for in emergency rooms.

""One potentially very important phrase in EMTALA,"" he said, ""is the reference to the woman's unborn child. Isn't that an odd phrase to put in a statute that imposes a mandate to perform abortions? Have you ever seen an abortion statute that uses the phrase, 'unborn child?'""

Alito pointed out, ""So in that situation, the hospital must stabilize the threat to the unborn child. And it seems like the plain meaning is that the hospital must try to eliminate any immediate threat to the child. Performing an abortion is antithetical to that duty.""

Abortion Leaks at the Supreme Court

Two years ago, Politico obtained a draft of the Dobbs ruling that overturned Roe v. Wade, stoking widespread outrage by pro-choice activists before the ruling was officially meant to be revealed. It fueled extremists who began firebombing and vandalizing pro-life pregnancy clinics and issuing death threats to the workers who try to help women facing unexpected pregnancies.

The Supreme Court never discovered who infamously leaked that Dobbs ruling, and now there is speculation about why this Idaho abortion ruling was also leaked.



Pro-life activist Kristan Hawkins posted on X, ""With media reporting on what appears to be a disappointing outcome in the EMTALA case, you have to wonder whether it's time for some people working on our nation's highest court need to be invited to find new jobs. Did the person who leaked the Dobbs decision 'accidentally' post today? Inquiring minds want to know.""","An pro-life protestor is seen on the ground after being pushed during a protest by abortion activists at the Supreme Court, June 24, 2024.

But things got bad when my father lost the elections. He became very sick and died. My brother was detained and died of starvation in prison.""



In order to survive, Mrs. Son and her mother escaped to China.



""We swam across the Tuman River for two days and bribed the North Korean soldiers and brokers in China. There we found a Christian church who helped us,"" Mrs. Son said.



After a few months, Chinese police began to trail them. Mrs. Son shared her harrowing experience.

""My mom noticed the police. She told me to jump out of the van when it stopped. I took off my clothes and shoes and gave to my mom because it was winter time and she needed to be warm. With only my underwear on, I jumped out of the van and 8 Chinese police chased me. I was already a Christian but not deep. But I knew it was God who protected me and instructed me to hide and hold onto the under bars of a truck. I got away but my mom was taken back to North Korea. I went back to try to find her only to find out that she suffered and died in prison because she did not deny her Christian faith.""



Mrs. Son eventually returned to China where she married a Chinese Christian. Several months later, she was re-captured though this time her husband gave her money to help her escape.



""Right before I was transferred to North Korea, I put all the money, the paper bills in plastic bags and swallowed them so that the soldiers will not see them. A week later, I got them all out. I used this to bribe the soldiers and brokers to go back to China.""



After yet another arrest, Mrs. Son spent 400 days in a North Korean prison under inhumane conditions where once again, she experienced God's help.



""The guard was my friend and he gave me rice. But it was the worse because I had to eat insects to survive. After 400 days, I was released… malnourished and could barely walk. This was when my husband used his Chinese citizenship to get me to South Korea,"" Mrs. Son recounted.



Once in South Korea, Mrs. Son joined the Seopyoung Church where she grew in her Christian faith. She realized how God saved her miraculously each time she was arrested.

The name of the church, ""Seopyoung"" stands for Seoul, the capital of South Korea and Pyongyang, the capital of North Korea. Most of its members are North Koreans whom they help settle in South Korea. The church envisions a unified North and South Korea by spreading the gospel in North Korea.



Rev. Chun Myeong Guen, head pastor of Seopyoung Church, said, ""It is impossible for North and South Korea to reunite politically because of different cultures and backgrounds. Therefore, reunification can only happen through faith because there will be no misunderstanding of each other. Only faith can make us reunite overnight.""

""During the starvation, many North Korean defectors escaped to China. Many believed Jesus, received Christian education in other countries and became missionaries in North Korea where there are now about 600,000 Christians in underground churches,"" he reports. ""Many Christians in South Korea who are praying for reunification believe it will happen in 5 years. It is like a ticking bomb.""



North Korean Christians like Mrs. Son can help make this happen.



""I want to thank my Mom and be like her. She gave her life for her Christian faith. I am also dedicating my life to serve Jesus Christ and spread the gospel and worship Him until I die,"" Mrs. Son said.","""We swam across the Tuman River for two days and bribed the North Korean soldiers and brokers in China.

Those are the words of Lex Renick, a female who formerly identified as a transgender male before she and her husband — who used to identify as homosexual — came to faith in Jesus.

Nic and Lex Renick got married on May 30, 2020, when both of them were living out their LGBT lifestyles. They have since turned away from their past decisions, with Lex restoring her female identity and returning to the name she was given at birth and Nic abandoning his homosexual identity.

Listen to the latest episode of “Quick Start”

The pair married one another as husband and husband but, since their respective salvation experiences, now identify as a heterosexual couple — husband and wife. They recently spoke with The Daily Wire’s Michael Knowles about their salvation experiences in a lengthy interview.

Knowles, a Catholic, described the couple’s testimony as “one of the wildest stories I’ve ever heard.”

In addition to restoring their live spiritually, Lex and Nic told Knowles they are seeing physical restoration. The two now share a healthy baby and, early on in their relationship, Lex underwent biopsies and was told she had cancerous cells in her body. But a doctor from Planned Parenthood recently told her, “This doesn’t make physical possible sense, but you no longer have any cancerous cells in your body.”

“I think it just goes to show that anyone can transform or turn into anything that they want,” said Nic of their experience together. “But nobody talks about transforming back to the original design that you’re supposed to be.”

He continued, “The world can tell you so much about who you’re ‘supposed to be’ based off of your interests or your personality type, and try to fit you into all of these crazy, outlandish boxes that might … make you feel included for a time.”

For her part, Lex opened up about the fact she believed the “lie” of the LGBT community.

“The whole world in the queer community was saying, ‘Well, you know if God made you then God made you this way,'” she recalled hearing. “[But] that argument doesn’t work with the trans community. Because, if we say, ‘God made me this way,’ then that means that I should have been a woman.”

Lex went on to explain to Knowles she found solace in the LGBT community because she was desperate for identity and belonging — something she had not previously found in her family or faith.

She grew up in an abusive household — one that claimed to be “Christian” — with a mother who struggled with alcoholism and even once told Lex, “If I would have known that you were going to be my child, I would have aborted you,” a comment her mother made after learning Lex struggled with her sexuality and gender identity.

Every time she tried to find comfort and safety in her family or in a church, Lex said they would “reject me.” Ultimately, she found the belonging she desired in the LGBT movement.

“I ran to this loving community, and that was the queer community, because they accepted me for me, not that I needed edifying or acceptance from the church,” she recalled. “I just needed a loving body of believers or family to wrap their arms around me and say, ‘Hey, we’re going to walk with you through this journey.’ But all I faced was rejection.”

Nic, on the other hand, began identifying as homosexual as a teenager but never faced the kind of isolation and rejection Lex experienced. His family, he said, “never tried to change me,” even though they took issue with his sexual identity, believing it contradicted God’s design for males and females.

“They didn’t condone or agree with what I was doing, and that is the exact Christian model of how I feel we should address the community,” he said. “We can’t shun or reject nor condone at the same time.”

Initially, as a transgender male — meaning biologically female — and a homosexual male, the couple wanted to have children, even when Lex was identifying as a man. But since their transformation, they have abandoned their former identities and now are true to their biological realities: a female and a male.

They currently share one child and just announced they are pregnant with their second baby.

The couple said they eventually found a church in Las Vegas where, even though its leaders didn’t condone their LGBT lifestyles, they welcomed them in as they were. It was there that they experienced true spiritual transformation.

“They chose to love us,” Lex said of the church they attended. “And that ministered to our hearts so much because we got to hang out with more believers and allow God to do the work on our hearts and then have friends in our lives to encourage us in the leading of the Lord rather than separating and kind of gatekeeping Jesus by taking people out of the church.”

In March, Lex and Nic renewed their wedding vows for the first time as husband and wife.

“I’m so in AWE of the Goodness of God,” Lex wrote in an Instagram post. “He is so so good! So many tears hearing my husband say, ‘I do,’ after Pastor Ivan said, ‘Do you take her to be your bride.’ Words, I never thought would be so sweet to hear deep within my soul. What an honor it is to be Nic’s bride. What an honor it is to serve God together and build His Kingdom.”

Now there's been a major revelation about how the Biden administration has pushed the transgender agenda when it comes to children.

According to the New York Times, Biden officials played a significant role in convincing an international pro-transgender medical group to remove age limits from its guidelines for trans surgeries.

""Email excerpts from members of the World Professional Association for Transgender Health (WPATH) recount how staff for Adm. Rachel Levine, assistant secretary for health at the Department of Health and Human Services and herself a transgender woman, urged them to drop the proposed limits from the group's guidelines and apparently succeeded,"" The Times reports.

The administration was reportedly concerned that age minimums would trigger political backlash that could fuel legislation opposing the trans ideology.

More than two dozen states now have laws restricting gender-altering medical experiments on the bodies of minors. And this week, the Supreme Court agreed to hear the Biden administration's challenge to one of those laws.

LATEST Supreme Court Takes up Hot Topic of Gender-Altering Procedures on Children

Critics say children are too young to make these irreversible, life-altering decisions while supporters claim that young people with gender dysphoria need the procedures right away.

But as CBN News reported earlier this year, U.S.-based think tank Environmental Progress reported that even the WPATH admitted behind closed doors that ""children and adolescents cannot comprehend the lifelong consequences of 'gender-affirming care,' and in some cases, due to poor health literacy, neither can their parents.""

MORE Leaked Files Reveal Major Risks with Transgender Experiments: 'It Is Not Medicine'

When we confronted WPATH about those claims, Marci Bowers, M.D., president of the group, told us in a statement, ""The world is not flat. Gender, like genitalia, is represented by diversity. The small percentage of the population that is trans or gender diverse deserves healthcare and will never be a threat to the global gender binary.""

Meanwhile, England and other European nations are backing away from transition procedures on minors after studies showed ""weak evidence"" that they lead to long-term positive impacts.

""This is one instance in which I think Europe is headed in the right direction,"" Sarah Parshall Perry of the Heritage Foundation told CBN's Wendy Griffith. ""In addition to that, we are now seeing Norway, Finland, Sweden, and now the most recent edition is Scotland who has backed off the use of chemical castration agents as well.""

There is also a growing number of people who regret undergoing gender transition and are seeking to revert back to their biological gender. They're warning distressed children and their families about rushing into life-altering medical decisions.

This debate is also the earliest in modern history, well ahead of the traditional fall schedule.

New rules aim to prevent chaotic scenes from past debates. There will be no live audience, no opening statements, and both candidates' microphones will be muted unless it's their turn to speak.

Performance on the debate stage might be the most crucial aspect for the 81-year-old Biden as Republicans highlight his age and mental health.

""Which Joe Biden's going to show up?"" asked House Speaker Mike Johnson. ""My summary is this: It doesn't matter if he drinks a whole gallon of energy drinks, he's not going to be able to match the acumen and the readiness of Donald Trump.""

Nathan Gonzales from Inside Elections tells CBN News that because some Republicans have portrayed Biden as too old and incompetent, the real challenge may lie with Donald Trump. ""Trump is used to feeding off the crowd and energy in the room, and that's just not going to be there,"" Gonzales explained. ""Trump is going to have to be disciplined when it comes to time and whether the mic is on or off. He must avoid being perceived as a bully.""

Biden is expected to focus on Trump's 34 felony convictions—a first for a presidential candidate—and other pending criminal cases. He will also likely address the abortion issue after the Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade, thanks to three Trump appointees. Trump, on the other hand, is expected to highlight issues such as the flood of unchecked migrants on the U.S. southern border and high inflation.

President Biden has been preparing for the debate at Camp David over the past several days. Former President Trump has been on the campaign trail, and Wednesday night, he attended a prayer conference call with members of a faith advisory board.

That news comes as top Israeli leaders visited the border with Lebanon where war could break out any day.

Aides to the prime minister have reportedly told the White House that when Netanyahu addresses a joint session of Congress in July, he'll present a new take on achieving a pathway to a Palestinian state. That would be a huge shift.

Yet those reports may be wrong. The Prime Minister's Office told The Times of Israel that Netanyahu ""opposes a Palestinian state and will not change his position in his address to Congress.""

The prime minister has consistently opposed Palestinian statehood in recent years, as poll after poll shows a huge majority of West Bank Palestinians themselves don't want a state next to Israel. They just want Israel destroyed.

Itamar Marcus, director of Palestinian Media Watch, points out most Palestinians hail the murderous attacks on Israelis, including what happened on October 7th.

""There's tremendous support within the West Bank for what happened on October 7th,"" Marcus stated. ""There was a poll taken a month and a half after October 7th – and everyone knew what happened, everybody knew about the rape and the destruction and the massacres – and Palestinians were asked 'With everything that's happened up till now, does it make you proud as a Palestinian?' And 98 percent of Palestinians said it made them proud.""

Preparing for War with Hezbollah & US Weapons Delays

On another front, both Netanyahu and Israeli President Isaac Herzog toured Israel's northern border with Lebanon this week. That's where all-out war may soon come, as the Jewish nation seeks to end daily attacks from Hezbollah on Israeli communities along the border.

In Washington, Israel's Defense Minister Yoav Gallant has supposedly made progress in speeding up shipments of weapons to the U.S. from Israel.

Netanyahu has accused the Biden administration of deliberately slow-walking such shipments.

For the first time, the U.S. administration is admitting there have been bottlenecks in getting some of those weapons shipped.

Gallant addressed Americans, saying Israel needs the U.S. by its side. ""The powerful and enduring bond between the United States and Israel is key to our nation's strategy and our security,"" the defense minister said.

Pennsylvania Sen. John Fetterman has been one Democrat particularly strong in supporting Israel's war with Hamas as others have wavered. He's met with Netanyahu on his first visit here. ""We stand with Israel through this and I'm so sorry for what's been done to this nation,"" Fetterman declared.

Turkey's President Recep Tayyip Erdogan pledged that his nation will stand with Hezbollah if it comes to war. He's condemning Western nations for backing Netanyahu, whose mental fitness he questioned. Erdogan asserted, ""It is extremely bad and pathetic that governments that talk about freedom, human rights, and justice are captives of a mentally ill person like Netanyahu.""

Antisemitism in NYC

In New York City, a masked man who demanded Jews get off a subway car earlier this month faces criminal charges of attempted coercion. He had yelled, ""Raise your hands if you're a Zionist – this is your chance to get out!""

Earlier this week, several dozen people protested against Manhattan District Attorney Alvin Bragg for his refusal to prosecute most of the anti-Israel demonstrators who illegally occupied Columbia University's Hamilton Hall this spring.

One protester said of Bragg, ""He's either a coward or an antisemite.""

Americans are being treated for health conditions such as heart disease, cancer, and depression to the tune of $43 trillion a year. One doctor believes up to 80 percent of these illnesses could be avoided by addressing what truly causes them.

After watching her beloved mother suffer from poor health for decades and then die relatively young, Casey Means pursued a career in medicine to help others avoid what happened to her mom.

""She had seen her doctors faithfully, taken all the medications, done exactly what they said, but the reality is she never healed,"" Dr. Means told CBN News.

Ditching Mainstream Medicine

After becoming a head and neck surgeon, Dr. Means became disillusioned with the entire process and walked away from mainstream medicine.

""What I saw in the health care system is that we're spending more money every single year on treating diseases, but patients in America aren't really getting better. Our rates of chronic illnesses are going up every single year,"" she said.

Dr. Means believes this is due to the system ignoring the root cause of many diseases, which she labels metabolic dysfunction.

""This leads to every imaginable chronic disease we're facing today from cancer to heart disease, stroke, Alzheimer's, dementia, type two diabetes, obesity, depression, anxiety, migraine, infertility, erectile dysfunction, you name it,"" Dr. Means said.

She explains in her book, Good Energy: The Surprising Connection Between Metabolism and Limitless Health, that metabolic dysfunction refers to how cells make energy, right down to the mitochondria.

Diet Matters Most

Dr. Means rates a proper diet as the best way to avoid metabolic dysfunction or reverse it. Other habits, like exercise and sleep, also play a role, but she says diet matters most. She believes if more doctors were to take ""an ultra-aggressive stance on diet"" with patients, many could avoid medications and surgery. However, with the current system in place, that's unlikely to happen.

""The average medical student in the United States does not take a single class in nutrition in medical school,"" Dr. Means said. ""Four years of medical school, three to seven years of residency, and we are not talking about nutrition or lifestyle virtually at all. So there's this huge mismatch between what's causing diseases and then what doctors are trained to understand and treat.""

After nine years, Dr. Means switched from surgery to functional medicine, one of the few specialties that emphasized healthy habits.

""It's a lot harder to counsel a patient for an hour on their lifestyle and their diet than send them with a prescription for a pill,"" Dr. Means said.

Avoid Processed Foods

Dr. Means says her top diet recommendation involves avoiding processed foods, which are found in packages and in many restaurants.

""Seventy percent of the calories we're eating in the United States today are ultra-processed foods made in factories,"" she said. ""Essentially we should think of ultra-processed food as a recent experiment in human culture that has failed. We know that ultra-processed foods drive diseases in children, in infants, in adults and the elderly.""

She advises people to eat food close to what's found in nature and ideally cooked at home.

""We've got to focus on the freshest, cleanest, unprocessed, whole foods as possible,"" she said.

Dr. Means recommends avoiding processed oils, such as soybean, vegetable, canola, shortening, peanut, safflower, and sunflower. She recommends consuming olive oil because it's rich in polyphenols, compounds that help protect against oxidative stress and inflammation. She also recommends avocado oil, and organic coconut oil.

As a child Hernandez was a migrant farm worker, toiling in fields in California alongside his Mexican parents and siblings. That hard labor fueled his big dreams of becoming an astronaut. And he never gave up on those dreams, even as NASA turned him down nearly a dozen times.

Now, his inspiring journey from rejection to acceptance has become a feature film called ""A Million Miles Away.""

Hernandez shared his inspiration to travel to outer space with CBN News' Studio 5.

""The stars always attracted me. When I was a kid, Star Trek, the first run series, was coming on, with Captain Kirk. Then when we would go out in the field, we would go away from the pollution of light of the city. It was still dark and man you can see constellations up above,"" he said.

""When I was a 10-year-old, I see on the black and white TV, the very last Apollo mission, Apollo 17, Gene Cernan, walking on the moon. That is when it hit me. I was like, 'I want to be like that guy. I want to go to outer space.' I told my dad, and my dad did something incredible. He only has a third-grade education, but he had the wisdom to empower me to believe it because he told me, 'I think you can do it.' As a 10-year-old, I never looked back. As I grew up, I just add perseverance,"" he continued.

Hernandez described his personal path to perseverance.

""I always tell people when you select something that you are going after, make sure you enjoy the journey because that is about 80 to 90% of your effort. So I was enjoying the journey,"" he told CBN News.

Faith also played a major role in Hernandez's life.



""A lot of people always argue with me and say, 'Isn't that a contradiction in life, science and religion?' and I say no. Quite the contrary. Science explains how things work. Religion explains why things happen. Not how things happen, but why they happen. And so it fills you spiritually as to why things happen. So, I think they go hand in hand,"" he told CBN News.

Many are now enjoying seeing his story on the big and small screens.

""It's kind of like I opened the door of my house to the public and they are all watching me now. I think it's good in the sense that I want people to see my story to understand where I came from that they get empowered to say that if he had it that bad and he was able to accomplish this, then why can't I accomplish my own goals,"" he said.

As a devoted father of five children, he is building a legacy they can model.

""My oldest four weeks ago, graduated from Purdue in Aerospace Engineering with a PhD. I asked him why Purdue. He said, 'Did you know that Purdue graduates the most Astronauts?' That's how he told me he wants to be an astronaut,"" he continued.

As Jose supports his son's space dreams, he's also back on the farm working alongside his dad in the vineyard their family owns.

""A Million Miles Away"" is streaming on the Amazon Prime platform.

Listen to the latest episode of “Quick Start”

The baptisms were part of an event series known as PNG for Christ, with initial estimates apparently accounting for only a portion of the total baptisms that took place, Adventist Today reported.

The outlet went on to say the PNG for Christ campaign is a joint Seventh-day Adventist effort of the Papua New Guinea Union Mission (PNGUM), the General Conference, and Adventist World Radio, among others.

The effort was reportedly a two-week campaign tour featuring Pastor Ted Wilson, president of the Seventh-day Adventist world church. He and his wife, Nancy, spoke at daily events as the crusade traveled around Papua New Guinea to share the Gospel.

Wilson released a May 19 statement on Facebook detailing some of the incredible baptism numbers that reportedly took place during these events.

“The latest information from the South Pacific Division and the Papua New Guinea Union Mission is that 278,369 people have been baptized so far in ‘PNG for Christ’ with only about 52% of the over 2000 sites reporting,” he wrote. “This is a miracle of God! Many more will be reported.”

He followed up that announcement a week later, revealing that more than 300,000 had been baptized as reports continued to come in from around the country.

Wilson said the PNG effort carefully instructed people in biblical truth to help them understand the Gospel. He went on to say the baptisms were evidence of the “Holy Spirit power being poured out on Papua New Guinea.”

Just days before Wilson’s post, Adventist Record stated in a May 14 article that, with official numbers still being counted, the total baptismal count was already at 260,000.

With so many being immersed, some pools had to be made to accommodate up to 1,000 people — an incredible feat that shows the depths of new believers’ desire to express their faith.

The impact of PNG for Christ on individual hearts was apparently sweeping, with the Adventist Record noting reports of “drug lords burning their marijuana crops and being baptised, prisoners responding to calls, whole villages declaring themselves Adventist, healings and people understanding the Gospel presentations in their own languages.”

PNG for Christ was coordinated by Pastor Miller Kuso, personal ministry director for PNGUM. He oversaw 2,000 sites where events were held throughout the country, including in some remote areas.

“It is a great privilege and honor for me to visit different sites right across our country,” he told the Adventist Record. “I would like to thank [the almost 300 international speakers] for standing together, as a movement, with PNGUM to deliver the message of hope, the message of salvation to the people of this great nation of Papua New Guinea.”

Be sure to pray for the hundreds of thousands who were reportedly baptized during PNG for Christ and for the many leaders helping disciple people who are leaving behind other religious and faith systems to begin new and vibrant relationships with Christ.

CBN News has reached out to the Seventh-day Adventist world church to confirm final baptism numbers and will update the story when we hear back.

The Department of Homeland Security is searching for hundreds of ISIS-related ""subjects of concern"" who crossed the southern U.S. border illegally.

The DHS says more than 400 migrants came into the U.S. from Central Asia through a smuggling network affiliated with the Islamic terrorist group referred to as ISIS. Only about 150 have been arrested while others are reportedly being tracked across 17 states.

However, the whereabouts of more than 50 of those suspects are unknown.

Most of the ISIS-connected individuals who crossed the border were allowed to stay because they were not on a terrorism watch list, according to NBC News.

House Committee on Homeland Security Chairman Mark E. Green, MD (R-TN) recently released a statement saying, ""Almost weekly we are getting reports that someone with terrorist ties or other major criminal connections has been released into our country by the Biden administration and allowed to roam free for months or even years.""

""It's only a matter of time before one of these individuals connected to a terrorist group is involved in something devastating on U.S. soil, and this administration will be responsible. How much longer will we let this madness continue?"" Green asked.

Recent attacks in Russia, such as this weekend's assault on churches and synagogues in the republic of Dagestan, have raised concerns about the terror group ISIS and its offshoots spreading abroad.

Earlier this month, federal agents revealed they had arrested eight people in several U.S. cities with alleged ties to ISIS.

Federal agencies released a joint statement saying, ""The individuals arrested are detained in ICE custody pending removal proceedings … The FBI and DHS will continue working around the clock with our partners to identify, investigate, and disrupt potential threats to national security.""

Lead Pastor Cole Bailey reflects on those challenging days with gratitude for CBN's Operation Blessing, praising it as a powerful, life-changing force for good.



Scars from Hurricane Michael are still visible in Panama City Beach. Where the former Lighthouse Church building once stood, now there's just a mere concrete slab that once supported a thriving congregation.



""When you're in Florida, a Category 3 hurricane might not worry you – but when it escalated to a five, we knew it was serious and we evacuated,"" said Pastor Bailey.



The first Category 5 storm to strike Florida's Panhandle, Michael became the most powerful hurricane to make landfall in the U.S. It claimed 59 lives and caused an estimated $25 billion in damage.



After 24 years of serving this community, Lighthouse Church lost its entire physical site to Hurricane Michael except for the ground it once stood on. The church's foundation in faith, however, remained unshaken.

Pastor Cole Bailey, an Air Force veteran, brought his military experience to bear when Hurricane Michael devastated Panama City Beach. As pastor of Lighthouse Church, his leadership was instrumental in organizing the community and coordinating relief efforts. He vividly recounted the pivotal moment when a helicopter from CBN's Operation Blessing landed at their ravaged property, bringing much-needed aid and volunteers to help restore hope and order.



""I get a call from someone from Operation Blessing and they said, 'We're looking for a church to partner with, someone in the area where we can come in, we can set up operations and begin to do what we do,'"" Pastor Bailey recounted. ""And I said, 'I'm your guy, I'm your guy.' And they said, 'Okay, can we land a helicopter in your parking lot?' And I was like, 'Come on, bring that helicopter here!' And I start telling everybody else like, 'Okay, Operation Blessing from CBN, they're bringing a chopper in, y'all, right now. They're on their way in.' And whenever that helicopter landed, we met a man named Tom. Tom got off that chopper, man. He shook my hand, and we walked around, and he said, 'Can we set up here?' And I'm like, 'Our place is your place. Do anything you want to do. I mean, we're so, so thankful that you're here.' And they came in and just brought peace to chaos.""



Volunteers brought chainsaws, hot meals, and a spirit of perseverance. Pastor Bailey saw it as the power of faith in action.

""They came in with resources that blew our minds,"" said Bailey. ""They came in with hundreds of volunteers just at one location. We were able to serve 38,000 hot meals after that storm. Resources are coming in, equipment is coming.""

Stephanie Robinson has been a part of Lighthouse since it started in 2000.

""I knew God was going to move, but it's hard to see in that, you know, that devastating time of just everything that God had kind of built, just plummeting,"" said Robinson. ""But it was amazing to watch the community of God just immediately step in.""

Despite the storm, Stephanie says the church found its true strength in the faith of its people. Today, the new building stands in a renovated movie theater across the bridge in Panama City.

""And it's a beautiful picture of God taking the destruction and bringing something out of the ashes really, and truly just exploding here,"" said Robinson.

Pastor Bailey mentioned the church is experiencing significant growth, with multiple services each week, and they currently do not have enough chairs to accommodate everyone attending. He highlighted that they have 1,300 people participating in small groups weekly.

""But this church right here is so thankful for when Operation Blessing landed on our property and helped us through the hardest time of our lives,"" said Pastor Bailey. ""I cannot express how life-changing and how powerful that ministry is.""

Less than five months from the presidential election, state officials are busy preparing for the voting process. According to one survey, a vast majority have increased security since 2020, hoping to ensure results can be trusted.

The Pentagon is reaching out to higher education for help, enlisting research teams from two Maryland universities. Their task: a three-year risk assessment focused specifically on the vulnerabilities of voting machines.

""We are looking at all the things that could possibly go wrong. Those could be an actor trying to disrupt something, maybe...trying to break a machine or trying to back vote for somebody who's dead, or things like that. But they could also be honest mistakes,"" Dr. Natalie Scala of Towson University told CBN News.

Scala, the co-director of the Empowering Secure Elections Lab at Towson, says this is the perfect assignment for academia, rather than government officials to tackle.

""For academics, we look at it based purely on data,"" Scala explained. ""So we don't necessarily have a favorite candidate. We don't necessarily have an agenda to push. We just want that vote to stay the way it is, from the moment somebody casts it to the moment we count it, we want nothing to happen there. And what can we do to make sure that that happens, that that integrity stays there, so the American people can have their votes counted.""

The project's focus involves optical scanners, used by 70 percent of voters, and ballot marking devices, used by the remaining 30 percent.

""We are looking at it from the, you know, America like the average American standpoint and making sure that you feel confident and secure in the processes that we have,"" Scala said.

In the past, her lab provided training for Maryland poll workers, a project she says will add to their current research.

""We don't want poll workers to make honest mistakes, and those mistakes become risks, you know, or problems. And we also want poll workers to be able to identify if something is going wrong,"" Scala said.

This is the first of the lab's three-year Pentagon grant. The team will consider cyber, physical, and insider threats. An overall approach, that will hopefully result in protecting other critical infrastructure, like the power grid.

The presumptive Republican presidential nominee told a crowd gathered in Philadelphia Saturday he is denying the Rev. Franklin Graham’s suggestion he avoid using course language during his speeches, essentially because it makes his addresses less interesting.

In a clip shared on X, Trump praised Graham as a “man I like” and described him as someone he admires before recalling a letter the evangelist — the son of the late Billy Graham — wrote, in which he asked the brash politician to stop using “foul language” on his campaign stops.

“He said, ‘President, I love your speaking. Your ability to speak is incredible. Your storytelling is great, but it could be so much better if you didn’t use foul language,'” Trump recalled of the note from Graham, before responding to his request, saying, “He’s wrong.”

While Trump claimed he has been working “so hard” to avoid course language during his speeches, he said the lengths of his monologues — which often run between one and two hours — make it very difficult for him to completely eliminate swearing from his vocabulary.

He requested Graham allow him “one or two” curse words, because “if you don’t, you don’t get the emphasis.”

Listen to the latest episode of “Quick Start”

To show he has made a good-faith effort, the former president noted a recent speech he delivered over the weekend at the Faith and Freedom Coalition’s Road to Majority Conference, a gathering of Christian political activists in Washington, D.C.

Trump said, “I was really good. I didn’t interject. Could have been better if I used a couple of bad words.”

The likely Republican presidential nominee, though, did acknowledge one scenario in which he would stop using bad words altogether: “When I see people start to walk out, then we’ll stop.”

“I’m not going to use the word bull****,” Trump stated, saying the full curse word without censoring himself, going on to claim it’s “not that bad a word.”

As for Graham, he told The Wall Street Journal earlier this year he does not officially endorse political candidates. The evangelist has nonetheless become a stalwart supporter of the former president.

In 2021, for example, 10 Republican lawmakers sided with Democrats in the U.S. House of Representatives in voting to impeach Trump over the rioting inside the U.S. Capitol. Graham compared those GOP legislators to Judas Iscariot, the wayward disciple who betrayed Jesus to the Roman authorities for 30 pieces of silver — a sinful decision that set into motion Jesus’ crucifixion.

“These ten, from [Trump’s] own party, joined in the feeding frenzy,” Graham wrote in a Facebook post at the time. “It makes you wonder what the thirty pieces of silver were that Speaker [Nancy] Pelosi promised for this betrayal.”

News of the language-based request from Graham comes as the Samaritan’s Purse and Billy Graham Evangelistic Association president launched a new fund for Christians facing religious liberty challenges in the United Kingdom.

“There are so many problems in our society, and people are looking for hope,” he said in a statement shared with CBN News. “We know that true hope can only be found in Jesus Christ, so we need to support one another in getting the Good News of Jesus Christ out — whatever it takes.”

CBN,https://www1.cbn.com/cbnnews/israel/2024/june/us-warns-hezbollah-but-pushes-for-diplomatic-solution-ultra-orthodox-draft-order-threatens-netanyahu-govt,2024-06-26,10:02:22 UTC,US Warns Hezbollah but Pushes for Diplomatic Solution; Ultra-Orthodox Draft Order Threatens Netanyahu Gov't,"JERUSALEM, Israel – Israel is facing rising pressures from outside and within today. As the Jewish state is simply looking to protect its people from daily rocket attacks, the U.S. is pushing for a diplomatic solution to the fighting between Lebanon-based Hezbollah and Israel before it turns into a full-blown war. Meanwhile, Israel's Supreme Court ruling Tuesday concerning the drafting of ultra-Orthodox men could also pose problems for Netanyahu's government.

U.S. Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin warned Hezbollah that Washington can't stop Israel from going to war to prevent the terror group's daily attacks on the north.

""Hezbollah's provocations threaten to drag the Israeli and Lebanese people into a war that they do not want,"" Austin said Tuesday. ""And such a war would be a catastrophe for Lebanon, and it would be devastating for innocent Israeli and Lebanese civilians.""

Still, Austin is urging Israel's visiting Defense Minister Yoav Gallant to seek a diplomatic solution.

""Another war between Israel and Hezbollah could easily become a regional war, with terrible consequences for the Middle East. And so, diplomacy is by far the best way to prevent more escalation,"" Austin stated.

Yoav Gallant says Israel is determined to establish security in the north and bring back some 80,000 citizens evacuated from their homes. He asked the U.S. to focus on heading off a larger threat: Iran getting nuclear weapons.

""The greatest threat to the future of the world and the future of our region is Iran. And time is running out,"" Gallant insisted.

In Israel itself, the Supreme Court ruled that ultra-Orthodox young men must now serve in the military. The community, which has 65,000 young men, has been exempt from the military draft since 1948 when Israel's first prime minister allowed 400 students to study full-time as a spiritual blessing to the state.

Former Knesset Member Dov Lipman, now the CEO of a group that helps immigrants, noted the exemption for the ultra-Orthodox posed a problem for secular Israelis. ""And broader Israel said that there needs to be equality,"" he told CBN News. How can there be tens of thousands who are being exempted from military service when everyone else is serving? Lipman explained the coalition partners with Netanyahu's Likud Party are ultra-Orthodox, and they don't want their people drafted. ""The Supreme Court ruling is (that) everyone gets drafted until you cover the law that shows equality. Everyone gets drafted. There's no way these ultra-Orthodox parties can stay in a government where that's the government policy – and that could collapse the government and lead to a new election,"" Lipman said.

And in a New York political campaign where Israel was a point of contention, Congressman Jamaal Bowman, a member of the Progressive “Squad” lost his primary race this week to moderate Democrat George Latimer. Bowman’s opposition to Israel was a key issue in the first loss for the Squad since it was formed 6 years ago.

Calling himself 'Eric,' he was an agent for China's Ministry of Public Security or 'First Bureau,' from 2008 until last year, when he defected to Australia.

He told CBN News, ""My job was to collect intelligence about the country I was in and the anti-communist groups there. I was supposed to infiltrate these groups, make friends, and trap targets for return to China.""

Eric was coerced into becoming an agent in 2008 after his arrest for supporting a pro-democracy party and given a choice: help the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) catch dissidents abroad or go to jail. He chose the former, taking on fake identities, such as a property executive and an anti-communist freedom fighter, to lure dissidents to countries where they could be abducted and returned to China.

But because he secretly protected targets and says no one was arrested because of his work, his handlers became suspicious, and he decided to defect.

""I did not want to be responsible for any targets being returned to China and tried to make sure that did not happen, and this made my bosses suspicious of me,"" Eric said.

Eric's testimony confirms our reporting and the reports of others that a Chinese government spy network is threatening, entrapping, and even kidnapping critics of the Chinese communist government.

""These are kind of the methods being used by the CCP. This is not an allegation we're making. This is what their official documents state,"" says Laura Harth, who tracks Chinese transnational repression for the human rights group Safeguard Defenders.

CCP Agents like Eric are known to operate in the U.S., but Harth says these agents are only one part of a larger campaign by the Chinese government, called ""The United Front.""



""The United Front is something that's being defined by the Chinese Communist Party as one of its 'secret' or 'magic' weapons. And essentially its task is two things: On the one hand, expand the circle of friends of the Chinese Communist Party. So, co-opting or influencing, politicians, media, academia, and entrepreneurs. But on the other hand, its task is also to crack down on critics, to silence them, to divide them.""

An Amnesty International survey of Chinese students in 24 universities in Europe and North America found that many live in fear of surveillance, harassment, or intimidation by Chinese agents.

Dissidents sent us photos of Chinese police paying visits to their relatives and warning them they face trouble and even jail if their family member doesn't stop criticizing the Chinese government.



It's unclear how many of the so-called Chinese police stations used to control dissidents are still operating in the U.S. On paper, it might be less than five. The one we reported about above a noodle shop in New York City was finally shut down by authorities.

Harth says, ""It's important to recognize that police stations or so-called police stations is really the tip of the iceberg. It's much more widespread than one, two or three single stations. We need to take a broad view and understand what the wider picture looks like and the amount of proxies and networks that the Chinese Party-state is operating.""



Bob Fu, founder and president of the Texas-based ministry China Aid helped lead the 1989 Tiananmen Square protests as a student. He still faces harassment by Chinese agents, 35 years later.



Fu told CBN News, ""In recent months, even I have been harassed and receiving threats, text messages and also CCP agents booked hotels under my name and then called the police, from New York to Los Angeles, from Washington, D.C. to Houston, basically for bomb threats, and said 'Bob Fu was about to set off bombs.'""

Pro-democracy activist Lijian Jie in Los Angeles, who Chinese agents have tried to kill three times, told us Chinese-Americans are ""still surrounded by constant threats of danger.""



In a special message to his former colleagues still trying to harass and trap Chinese dissidents, Eric encouraged them to ""recognize the nature of the communist party,"" that ""it is a fascist totalitarian party,"" and that ""carrying out these illegal and secret activities in various countries is not good for you."" He challenges them to instead ""do something good for human civilization.""

The US planemaker also plans to assume about $3.5 billion of Spirit’s debt as part of the deal, which may be announced as soon as Monday, said the people, who asked not to be identified before the transaction is made public. Reuters reported the per-share price earlier Sunday. Representatives for the companies declined to comment.

Boeing plans to take control of the Spirit’s manufacturing that supports its commercial jet line-up, including building frames for its cash-cow 737 Max, two of the people said. It will also gain control over a portion of Spirit’s defense contract work, they said.

Boeing arch-rival Airbus SE is also expected to announce that it’s taking control over some of the Spirit factories that manufacture structures and components for its commercial aircraft. Terms for that transaction weren’t immediately available.

Boeing is seeking to reintegrate Spirit after an accident in January on board a 737 Max-9 airliner revealed quality and manufacturing shortcomings at both Boeing and its most important supplier and led to a rethinking of their relationship.

Spirit has faced growing financial pressure and scrutiny alongside Boeing after the door-shaped panel on a 737 Max 9 model blew out minutes after takeoff. Shipments of 737 fuselages have plummeted as Boeing steps up its inspections in Kansas and back at home near Seattle, and declined to accept aircraft structures with missing components or incomplete work.

For Boeing, the deal brings a key supplier for the 737, 787 Dreamliner and other commercial jets back in-house at a time when the company is feeling the financial strain from the slowed-down output. Boeing lost about $4 billion in cash in the first quarter and is set to lose a similar amount in the current three months of the year. The company’s credit rating is hovering one level above speculative grade, and management is keen to avoid slipping into junk territory.

The Wichita campus that builds most of the 737 airframe for Boeing along with the nose sections of the 787 Dreamliners had been at the heart of several defects as it grappled with post-Covid workforce turnover. Reintegrating Spirit aims to help Boeing stabilize its supply chain and gain greater control of its aircraft production.","Boeing Co. agreed Sunday to purchase Spirit AeroSystems Holdings Inc. for $37.25 per share in an all-stock deal that values the company at $4.7 billion, according to people with knowledge of the transaction.

Fortune,https://fortune.com/2024/06/30/kevin-costner-movie-horizon-box-office-debut-santa-barbara-property-mortgage/,2024-06-30,23:10:46 UTC,Kevin Costner mortgaged one of his properties to finance 'Horizon' but movie flops,"“ A Quiet Place: Day One ” is making noise at the box office. The prequel earned an estimated $53 million in its first weekend in North American theaters, according to studio estimates Sunday.

It’s both a franchise best and significantly more than expected. Going into the weekend, prerelease tracking had “Day One” pegged for a $40 million debut, but audiences were clearly more enthusiastic to see the action-horror starring Lupita Nyong’o and Joseph Quinn and released by Paramount. The same could not be said for Kevin Costner’s “ Horizon: An American Saga—Chapter 1,” which opened to $11 million.

The ”Quiet Place” victory wasn’t quite enough to snag the coveted first place spot on the charts, though. That honor again went to Disney and Pixar’s juggernaut “ Inside Out 2,” which added an estimated $57.4 million in its third weekend in theaters, and crossed $1 billion globally.

There’s a distant possibility that the places will shift when actuals are released Monday. But either way it’s good news for movie theaters in a summer season that’s finally heating up but still running far behind last year (down 19%) and pre-pandemic norms (down 36% from 2019).

“Inside Out 2” continues to be a box office phenomenon, the likes of which the industry hasn’t seen since “Barbie” almost a year ago. In just three weeks of release, it’s earned nearly $470 million in North America and $545.5 million internationally, bringing its global total to $1.01 billion. The sequel is the only 2024 release to cross the billion dollar mark and it did it in just 19 days, a record for an animated film.

“The film’s stunning global success once again illustrates that audiences the world over will respond to compelling, entertaining movies, and that they want to enjoy them on the big screen,” said Michael O’Leary, president and CEO of the National Association of Theatre Owners, in a statement.

“A Quiet Place: Day One,” directed by Michael Sarnoski and rated PG-13, is also fast approaching an important threshold out of the gates. Including the $45.5 million from international showings in 59 markets, the $67 million production has already made $98.5 million.

“There’s a lot of love for the ‘A Quiet Place’ franchise,” said Chris Aronson, the head of domestic distribution for Paramount. “We listened to the fans who wanted to expand the universe.”

In a rare feat for a third film, it opened higher than both “A Quiet Place” ($50.2 million opening in April 2018) and “ A Quiet Place: Part II ” ($47.5 million opening in May 2021). John Krasinski, who wrote and directed the first two, continued serving as a producer.

“It’s one of those rare horror franchises that has generated incredible goodwill with audiences and critics alike,” said Paul Dergarabedian, the senior media analyst for Comscore.

Playing on 3,708 screens in the U.S. and Canada, nearly 40% of its domestic earnings came from “premium screens” including IMAX and other large formats. It entered the marketplace with mostly positive reviews (84% on Rotten Tomatoes); Audiences gave it a B+ CinemaScore and four out of five stars on PostTrak.

“We put together a compelling package but also I think it shows people want to go to the movies,” Aronson said. “The marketplace really works when there are choices and there’s something for everybody.”

The start for “Horizon,” meanwhile, was sluggish. Though older audiences, the ones most likely to support a Western epic, don’t typically rush out to see films on opening weekend the way people often do for horrors and superheroes, the road ahead will not be easy: Reviews have not been great and it got an underwhelming B- CinemaScore.

The stakes are also a little different for “Horizon,” a $100 million production that Costner financed on his own and partnered with Warner Bros. to distribute. It opened in 3,334 locations. A decades-old passion project, he mortgaged property in Santa Barbara, Calif. to finance it and exited “Yellowstone” to see it through. In a bold, unconventional strategy, “Chapter 2” arrives in theaters later this summer, on Aug. 16. He also has plans for two more movies.

“The western genre is one of those that is very specific,” Dergarabedian said. “It’s going to be about the long game.”

A quick glance at the top 10 shows that audiences are largely favoring franchises and “known commodities” over originals. “Bad Boys: Ride or Die” was right behind “Horizon” on the charts, and it’s been in theaters for four weeks already.

“Audiences in the summer want the tried and true, they want the familiar,” Dergarabedian said.

He was also struck by the diversity of genres in the top 10, including two Indian films: The Telugu language sci-fi “Kalki 2898 AD” in fifth place with $5.4 million and the Punjabi language “Jatt & Juliet 3” in ninth place with $1.5 million.

“If you can’t find something that appeals to you at the multiplex right now, you’re not looking hard enough,” Dergarabedian said.

Estimated ticket sales for Friday through Sunday at U.S. and Canadian theaters, according to Comscore. Final domestic figures will be released Monday.

1. “Inside Out 2,” $57.4 million.

2. “A Quiet Place: Day One,” $53 million.

3. “Horizon: An American Saga—Chapter 1,” $11 million.

4. “Bad Boys: Ride or Die,” $10.3 million.

5. “Kalki 2898 AD,” $5.4 million.

6. “The Bikeriders,” $3.3 million.

Fortune,https://fortune.com/2024/06/30/boeing-criminal-fraud-plea-deal-justice-department-737-max-crash/,2024-06-30,22:45:44 UTC,"DoJ is pushing Boeing to plead guilty to criminal fraud, but families of victims from fatal crashes say the offer looks like a ‘sweetheart deal’","The U.S. Justice Department is pushing Boeing to plead guilty to criminal fraud in connection with two deadly plane crashes involving its 737 Max jetliners, according to several people who heard federal prosecutors detail a proposed offer Sunday.

Boeing will have until the end of the coming week to accept or reject the offer, which includes the giant aerospace company agreeing to an independent monitor who would oversee its compliance with anti-fraud laws, they said.

The case stems from the department’s determination that Boeing violated an agreement that was intended to resolve a 2021 charge of conspiracy to defraud the U.S. government. Prosecutors alleged at the time that Boeing misled regulators who approved the 737 Max and set pilot-training requirements to fly the plane. The company blamed two relatively low-level employees for the fraud.

The Justice Department told relatives of some of the 346 people who died in the 2018 and 2019 crashes about the plea offer during a video meeting. The family members, who want Boeing to face a criminal trial and to pay a $24.8 billion fine, reacted angrily. One said prosecutors were gaslighting the families; another shouted at them for several minutes when given a chance to speak.

“We are upset. They should just prosecute,” said Massachusetts resident Nadia Milleron, whose 24-year-old daughter, Samya Stumo, died in the second of two 737 Max crashes. “This is just a reworking of letting Boeing off the hook.”

Prosecutors told the families that if Boeing rejects the plea offer, the Justice Department would seek a trial in the matter, meeting participants said. Justice Department officials presented the offer to Boeing during a meeting later Sunday, according to a person familiar with the situation.

Boeing and the Justice Department declined to comment.

The plea deal would take away the ability of U.S. District Judge Reed O’Connor to increase Boeing’s sentence for a conviction, and some of the families plan to ask the Texas judge to reject the deal if Boeing agrees to it.

“The underlying outrageous piece of this deal is that it doesn’t acknowledge that Boeing’s crime killed 346 people,” said Paul Cassell, one of the lawyers for victims’ families. “Boeing is not going to be held accountable for that, and they are not going to admit that that happened.”

Sanjiv Singh, a lawyer for 16 families who lost relatives in the October 2018 Lion Air crash off Indonesia, called the plea offer “extremely disappointing.” The terms, he said, “read to me like a sweetheart deal.”

Another lawyer representing families who are suing Boeing, Mark Lindquist, said he asked the head of the Justice Department’s fraud section, Glenn Leon, whether the department would add additional charges if Boeing turns down the plea deal. “He wouldn’t commit one way or another,” Lindquist said.

The meeting with crash victims’ families came weeks after prosecutors told O’Connor that the American aerospace giant breached the January 2021 deal that had protected Boeing from criminal prosecution in connection with the crashes. The second one took place in Ethiopia less than five months after the one in Indonesia.

A conviction could jeopardize Boeing’s status as a federal contractor, according to some legal experts. The company has large contracts with the Pentagon and NASA.

However, federal agencies can give waivers to companies that are convicted of felonies to keep them eligible for government contracts. Lawyers for the crash victims’ families expect that would be done for Boeing.

Boeing paid a $244 million fine as part of the 2021 settlement of the original fraud charge. The Justice Department is likely to seek another, similar penalty as part of the new plea offer, said a person familiar with the matter who spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss an ongoing to discuss an ongoing case.

The deal would include a monitor to oversee Boeing — but the company would put forward three nominees and have the Justice Department pick one, or ask Boeing for additional names. That provision was particularly hated by the family members on the call, participants said.

The Justice Department also gave no indication of moving to prosecute any current or former Boeing executives, another long-sought demand of the families.

Lindquist, a former prosecutor, said officials made clear during an earlier meeting that individuals – even CEOs – can be more sympathetic defendants than corporations. The officials pointed to the 2022 acquittal on fraud charges of Boeing’s chief technical pilot for the Max as an example.

It is unclear what impact a plea deal might have on other investigations into Boeing, including those following the blowout of a panel called a door plug from the side of a Boeing Max 9 during an Alaska Airlines flight in January.","The U.S. Justice Department is pushing Boeing to plead guilty to criminal fraud in connection with two deadly plane crashes involving its 737 Max jetliners, according to several people who heard federal prosecutors detail a proposed offer Sunday.

Fortune,https://fortune.com/2024/06/30/us-deficit-outlook-debt-service-costs-treasury-bond-market-federal-reserve/,2024-06-30,22:20:29 UTC,"The U.S. deficit is nearly as big a Russia’s economy, and there’s a ‘vicious’ feedback loop that could make it worse","The presidential election has brought the issue of federal budget deficits back into the spotlight as markets weigh the impact of another Biden or Trump administration on government revenue and spending.

A week before this past Thursday’s presidential debate, the Congressional Budget Office updated its projections for U.S. debt and deficits.

The CBO’s new estimate for the fiscal 2024 deficit is now $1.9 trillion, up from its prior view for $1.6 trillion issued in February and up from the 2023 deficit of about $1.7 trillion.

While the 2024 figure falls short of the pandemic-era high of $3 trillion, a level of $1.9 trillion nearly matches Russia’s entire GDP, which the World Bank put at $2 trillion in 2023, making it the 11th biggest economy in the world.

Part of the reason for the increase in the projected 2024 deficit was to account for emergency spending that went to help Ukraine fight Russia, the CBO said. Other emergency appropriations went to Israel and U.S. allies in Asia.

Meanwhile, the U.S. deficit eclipses other major economies like Mexico’s ($1.79 trillion), Australia’s ($1.72 trillion), and South Korea’s ($1.71 trillion).

For now, financial markets have largely focused more on inflation data and when the Federal Reserve will cut rates. But that doesn’t mean the risks of a widening deficit and debt are absent.

Former New York Fed President Bill Dudley told Bloomberg TV on Wednesday that unsustainable trends always come to an end.

He also warned that the situation could go south quickly. For example, if bond markets start to balk at buying Treasuries, interest rates will go up to attract more demand. That leads to the government paying more for debt service costs, which then adds further to the deficit.

“So the feedback loop here can be quite vicious,” Dudley said. “The hard thing is to know the timing.”

He added that there’s less demand for U.S. Treasury bonds in certain corners of the global market because Western sanctions on Russia prompted other countries to diversify away from dollar-denominated assets.

In addition, debt that was issued at lower rates is now being rolled over to higher rates, so debt service costs are going up more rapidly than total debt, Dudley said.

The election and its aftermath could be catalysts. Amid a Wall Street Journal report that said Trump’s allies have drawn up plans to erode the Fed’s independence, an election victory could raise concerns the Fed will monetize U.S. debt by buying more Treasuries and stoking inflation.

To be sure, it wouldn’t be easy to gain control over the Fed as the regional bank presidents aren’t appointed by the White House and Fed governors have staggered terms, Dudley pointed out.

“That said, just the mere attempt to take control of the Fed, to diminish the Fed’s independence could be the spark that rattles markets,” he added.","The CBO’s new estimate for the fiscal 2024 deficit is now $1.9 trillion, up from its prior view for $1.6 trillion issued in February and up from the 2023 deficit of about $1.7 trillion.

Fortune,https://fortune.com/asia/2024/06/30/david-meets-goliath-japan-korea-make-startups-work-large-conglomerates-twist-silicon-valley/,2024-06-30,21:00:00 UTC,"Japan, Korea twist Silicon Valley model through conglomerate-startup connections","We all know how things work in Silicon Valley. Brilliant individuals with great ideas disrupt whole industries: Uber and public transport, Tesla and car-making, even Microsoft and the workplace itself. Older incumbents won’t, and can’t, adapt with the times—and so they disappear, replaced by the firms of today and tomorrow. It’s the way tech hubs are supposed to work.

Except that not all do.

The Silicon Valley model is tied closely to the economic model of the U.S.—and so difficult to replicate elsewhere. Silicon Valley excels in some aspects of frontier technology but lost its manufacturing edge long ago.

Around the world, policymakers are tweaking the idea of Silicon Valley to better match the idiosyncrasies of their own economies and carve out a unique advantage in key global markets.

Look to Japan and Korea for examples. Large conglomerates dominate the economies of both countries, whether Japan’s keiretsu or South Korea’s chaebol. Officials in Tokyo and Seoul don’t see the point of startups disrupting hugely successful and internationalized companies to the point that they disappear.

Instead, they want startups to work with giants like Hyundai, Samsung, SK, Sony or Toyota. It’s an instance of David meeting Goliath: an open innovation model where small firms and big conglomerates work together, aided by the government. This approach helps policymakers innovate in the design and manufacturing of tomorrow’s technologies.

Critics often accuse chaebols and keiretsu of stifling competition. But Japanese and Korean policymakers don’t want to work against the conglomerates that have helped their countries become two of the richest and most innovate economies in the world.

For a forthcoming book, titled Startup Capitalism, we studied how both Japan and Korea tried to foster this collaboration between startups and conglomerates. Government support for this “David and Goliath” relationship survived Japan and Korea’s frequent changes in political leadership; it’s now part of the fabric of both economies.

But why is this the case?

To begin with, startups get access to expertise, mentoring, and sales channels that they’d find difficult to develop on their own. Managers in a conglomerate like LG and Nissan have decades of experience in their core business sectors. Startup founders, generally, do not—instead relying on connections from VC backers or their own personal networks

Programs such as K-Startup Grand Challenge, anchored by Seoul’s Ministry of SMEs & Startups, or J-Startup, led by Tokyo’s Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry, help to bridge this asymmetry in resources and access. Large firms join these government programs as judges, coaches, and would-be partners for startups. The Japanese and Korean governments thus act as matchmakers between entrepreneurs and leading conglomerates. (The U.S. policy approach, instead, is to only support startups.)

By taking part in these programs, Japanese and Korean startups also get access to capital and, often, exit strategies. Seoul and Tokyo pour billions of taxpayer dollars into supporting entrepreneurs via institutions like the Korea Venture Investment Corporation or the Japan Finance Corporation. Connecting these startups with chaebol or keiretsu that otherwise may not know about their ideas or products makes it easier for the big firms to decide whether to invest in their smaller counterparts.

So, startups clearly benefit from working with conglomerates. But what do larger companies get out of this?

The second advantage of this open innovation model is that the keiretsu and chaebol get access to new ideas and products. Several Japanese and Korean policymakers told us that they were worried that their national champions might go the way of Motorola or Nokia, former innovation powerhouses that got left behind. Working together with startups is one way that big conglomerates can develop new products and improve existing ones.

Ultimately, Japan and Korea want startups and conglomerates to work together to improve the economy. They see startups as drivers of innovation and growth in quality jobs; conglomerates help these smaller firms achieve that.

Conglomerates also provide manufacturing chops needed to make future technologies at scale. Silicon Valley long ago outsourced the production of key technologies, like semiconductors, elsewhere. Bringing those manufacturing abilities—that offer quality jobs and contribute to clusters of talent—back onshore is a key aim of the U.S.’s multi-billion-dollar CHIPS Act.

In fact, it seems this model of startups working together with large companies is now getting picked up in other parts of the world. In the AI sector, Microsoft is working with smaller partners like ChatGPT developer OpenAI and France’s Mistral. Both Amazon and Google have invested in developers like Anthropic; China’s big tech companies are also buying large stakes in the country’s AI startups. The Biden administration and the Von der Leyen Commission are both pushing startup-big firm collaboration as part of their respective industrial policies.

We should expect the Japanese and Korean model of startup-big firm collaboration to become more widespread. Governments are turning towards industrial policy and economic nationalism, and away from laissez-faire liberalism—in other words, closer to the policies long espoused by Tokyo and Seoul.

Silicon Valley isn’t dead. But its version of startup capitalism isn’t the only game in town anymore.

The projections indicated that Macron’s risky decision to call voters back to the polls for the second time in three weeks appeared to have backfired.

French polling agencies said Macron’s grouping of centrist parties could finish a distant third in the first-round ballot. Those projections put Macron’s camp behind both Marine Le Pen’s National Rally and a new left-wing coalition of parties that joined forces to keep her anti-immigration party with historical links to antisemitism from being able to form the first far-right government in France since World War II.

But with another torrid week of campaigning to come before the decisive final voting next Sunday, the election’s ultimate outcome remained uncertain.

Macron urged voters to rally against the far right in the second round.

Addressing a jubilant crowd waving French tricolor flags of blue, white and red, Le Pen called on her supporters and voters that didn’t back her party in the first round to push it over the line and give it a commanding legislative majority. In that scenario, Le Pen’s 28-year-old protege, Jordan Bardella, would become prime minister. Macron, who has said he will not step down before his term expires in 2027, would be forced into an awkward power-sharing arrangement called “ cohabitation” in France.

Still, the National Rally isn’t there yet.

Although polling agency projections gave it around one-third of the national vote on Sunday, it remains unclear how the party’s surge will translate into actual seats in round two.

Some polling agency projections indicated that in the best-case scenario for the far right, the National Rally and its allies could collectively clear the bar of 289 seats needed for a secure majority in the 577-seat National Assembly. That could spook European financial markets, affect Western support for Ukraine and the management of France’s nuclear arsenal and global military force.

But, depending on how the second round shakes out, the far right could also fall short, with no single bloc securing a clear majority, polling agencies projected. Predictions are difficult because of the two-round voting system,and because parties will work between the rounds to make alliances in some constituencies or pull out of others. Early official results for the first round were expected later Sunday.

Many French voters are frustrated about inflation and other economic concerns, as well as Macron’s leadership, seen as arrogant and out-of-touch with their lives. The National Rally party has tapped that discontent, notably via online platforms such as TikTok.

Voters in Paris had issues including immigration and the rising cost of living on their minds as the country grew more divided between the far-right and far-left blocs, with a deeply unpopular and weakened president in the political center. The campaign was marred by rising hate speech.

“People don’t like what has been happening,” said Cynthia Justine, 44. “People feel they’ve lost a lot in recent years. People are angry. I am angry.” She added that with “the rising hate speech,” it was necessary to express frustrations with those holding and seeking power.

She said it was important as a woman to vote since women haven’t always had that right. And “because I am a Black woman, it’s even more important. A lot is at stake on this day.”

Macron called the early elections after his party was trounced in the European Parliament election earlier in June by the National Rally, which has historic ties to racism and antisemitism and is hostile toward France’s Muslim community. It also has historical ties to Russia.

Macron’s call was an audacious gamble that French voters who were complacent about the European election would be jolted into turning out for moderate forces in national elections to keep the far right out of power.

A 64-year-old voter, Philippe Lempereur, expressed fatigue with politicians from the left, right and center and what he called their inability to work together on issues such as ensuring people have shelter and enough to eat. “We vote by default, for the least worse option,” he said. “I prefer to vote than do nothing.”

Bardella, who has no governing experience, says he would use the powers of prime minister to stop Macron from continuing to supply long-range weapons to Ukraine for the war with Russia.

The National Rally has also questioned the right to citizenship for people born in France, and it wants to curtail the rights of French citizens with dual nationality. Critics say this undermines human rights and is a threat to France’s democratic ideals.

Meanwhile, huge public spending promises by the National Rally and especially the left-wing coalition have shaken markets and ignited worries about France’s heavy debt, already criticized by EU watchdogs.

In the restive French Pacific territory of New Caledonia, polls closed earlier due to a curfew that authorities have extended until July 8. Violence flared there last month, leaving nine people dead, due to attempts by Macron’s government to amend the French Constitution and change voting lists, which the Indigenous Kanaks feared would further marginalize them. They have long sought to break free from France.

Voters in France’s other overseas territories of Saint-Pierre-et-Miquelon, Saint-Barthélemy, Saint-Martin, Guadeloupe, Martinique, Guyana and French Polynesia, and those voting in offices opened by embassies and consular posts across the Americas cast their ballots Saturday.","France’s high-stakes legislative elections propelled the far-right National Rally to a strong but not decisive lead in the first-round vote Sunday, polling agencies projected, dealing another slap to centrist President Emmanuel Macron.

In a note on Sunday, he pointed out that the top 10 companies in the S&P 500 account for 35% of the index’s market value but only 23% of its earnings.

“This divergence has never been bigger, suggesting that the market is record bullish on future earnings for the top 10 companies in the index,” Sløk wrote. “In other words, the problem for the S&P 500 today is not only the high concentration but also the record-high bullishness on future earnings from a small group of companies.”

Because the S&P 500 is weighted by market cap, soaring share prices of Big Tech companies rushing into the AI boom has meant that recent gains are concentrated into just a handful of stocks, obscuring the relative mediocrity for rest of the index.

Before Nvidia began its selloff earlier this month, the AI chip leader accounted for more than a third of the S&P 500’s rally this year.

“Such a high concentration implies that if Nvidia continues to rise, then things are fine,” Sløk warned on June 12. “But if it starts to decline, then the S&P 500 will be hit hard.”

As market leadership becomes more concentrated, so are investors’ portfolios, especially as putting money in funds that track indexes becomes increasingly popular.

Bank of America analysts said in a recent note that the average large-cap fund has 33% of its portfolio in its top five holdings, up from just 26% in December 2022.

Similarly, the share of funds the have more than 40% of their portfolio in their top five holdings has jumped to 25% from less 5% in December 2022.

Meanwhile, Wall Street analysts have been bullish on the S&P 500 and are scrambling to raise their year-end targets. Even one of the biggest bears has surrendered and is now one of the most bullish analysts.

Fortune,https://fortune.com/2024/06/30/home-price-trend-new-vs-existing-homes-housing-market-outlook/,2024-06-30,17:35:08 UTC,This decades-long trend in home prices has been ‘flipped on its head’ amid a big shift in the housing market,"The historically unaffordable housing market has been forcing builders to start making smaller homes, and that has now triggered a major milestone in prices.

Since the mid-1980s, new homes typically commanded a price premium over existing homes, Howard Hughes Holdings CEO David O’Reilly told CNBC on Wednesday, adding that it has been shrinking over the past several months. Now it’s gone.

“Today’s result said that that’s actually flipped on its head,” he said.

For the month of May, the median sales for a new home price fell 0.9% from a year earlier to $417,400, the Commerce Department said on Wednesday.

By contrast, the median sales price for an existing home jumped 5.8% from a year ago to a fresh record-high of $419,300 in May, the National Association of Realtors said earlier this month. The NAR said that reflected more sales of high-priced properties as well as multiple offers.

And since the start of the year, the price of existing homes has been even steeper, jumping 10.8% from $378,600 in January. For new homes, it was $430,400 in January.

That’s as the housing market’s lock-in effect has kept the supply of existing homes tight because homeowners with low mortgage rates are reluctant to give them up and are not selling. But demand has stayed elevated, adding upward pressure on prices.

Meanwhile, the latest quarterly reports from homebuilders showed that average selling prices are coming down, O’Reilly said, citing a shift in the product mix.

“That shows the consumer adjusting to a smaller home, taking less space and trying to get back into that range of affordability,” he said.

O’Reilly, whose heads real estate development and management company also works with builders, has been bullish on the sector, declaring in April that this is the “golden age of homebuilding.”

The reversal in home prices for new homes versus existing homes also comes as the $200,000 starter home is going extinct, making it tougher for first-time buyers to get into the housing market.

“Over the past several years, the number of homes under $200,000 has gone from around half of all sales to less than a quarter of sales in 2023,” Realtor.com said in a report earlier this month, calling the statistic, “stark proof of shrinking affordability across the country.”","The historically unaffordable housing market has been forcing builders to start making smaller homes, and that has now triggered a major milestone in prices.

Fortune,https://fortune.com/2024/06/30/indebted-countries-warning-bank-of-international-settlements-government-bond-markets/,2024-06-30,15:44:19 UTC,"Heavily indebted countries can look just fine until suddenly they don’t, finance watchdog warns—’That is how markets work’","Indebted countries are vulnerable to a precipitous loss of confidence even though that risk is barely acknowledged in bond markets, the Bank for International Settlements warned.

The Basel-based institution said in its annual economic report released on Sunday that countries whose bloated fiscal positions are further stretched by higher interest rates should prioritize fiscal repair. Claudio Borio, head of the BIS’s monetary and economic department, said they must act “with urgency.”

“We know from experience that things look sustainable until suddenly they no longer do,” he told reporters. “That is how markets work.”

While the need to fix public finances has been a recurring theme for the BIS, the remarks coincide with heightened scrutiny on indebted economies. Worries about France this month prompted investors to demand the highest premium on its bonds since 2012.

The Basel officials didn’t specify any country in particular, but they did feature a chart looking at the debt and market pricing of some of the world’s biggest borrowers, including Japan, Italy, the US, France, Spain and the UK.

In order to stabilize finances, advanced economies can this year run deficits no larger than 1% of gross domestic product, down from 1.6% last year, the BIS said. That’s a fraction of the current US deficit, which the International Monetary Fund described last week as “much too large.”

“Though financial market pricing points to only a small likelihood of public finance stress at present, confidence could quickly crumble if economic momentum weakens and an urgent need for public spending arises on both structural and cyclical fronts,” the BIS said. “Government bond markets would be hit first, but the strains could spread more broadly.”

Inflation is subsiding however, BIS officials acknowledge. The world is currently set for a “smooth landing,” General Manager Agustin Carstens said.

Services still pose a risk to that outlook, with prices in that area out of step with pre-pandemic trends, the report said. In addition, increases in the cost of commodities due to geopolitical tensions could reignite inflation.

Given these pressure points, officials highlighted that central banks should be cautious about cutting rates too soon. That could prove costly to their reputations if such policy needs to be reversed amid a flare-up of inflation again, the report said.

Policymakers already did their fair share to contribute to that problem, the BIS suggested, repeating its accusation that “with the benefit of hindsight,” pandemic-era stimulus probably raised the risks of second-round effects.

While central banks shouldn’t ease too soon, governments also have a part to play with too-loose fiscal policy, officials said. Instead, they should widen tax bases and deliver structural reforms to meet future challenges including demographic shifts and climate change.

“Our main message is that central banks alone cannot deliver a durable increase in economic growth and prosperity,” Borio said. “Laying the foundation for a brighter economic future also requires actions from other policymakers, especially governments.”","The Basel-based institution said in its annual economic report released on Sunday that countries whose bloated fiscal positions are further stretched by higher interest rates should prioritize fiscal repair.

Fortune,https://fortune.com/2024/06/30/superyachts-scientists-ocean-research-climate-change-environment-noaa-fleet/,2024-06-30,15:21:53 UTC,Superyachts aren't just for the super-rich: Hundreds of scientists use them,"For almost two years, Robert Brewin collected data from the bow of a superyacht as it sailed pristine waters from the Caribbean Sea to the Antarctic Ocean.

The Archimedes, a 222-foot (68-meter) “adventure” yacht then owned by the late hedge funder James Simons, boasts a gym, a jacuzzi and an elevator. But between 2018 and 2020, Brewin was concerned only with the boat’s Sea-Bird Scientific Solar Tracking Aiming System, installed to measure light reflecting off of the water. A senior lecturer at the UK’s University of Exeter, Brewin and his colleagues were analyzing microplankton — microscopic organisms at the base of the marine food chain — by studying the ocean’s color. The Sea-Bird’s readouts helped them verify satellite imagery.

Brewin’s was not your typical superyacht itinerary, but he is one of hundreds of scientists to have used an adventure yacht — also known as expedition or explorer yachts — to conduct research on the ocean. In a paper published in January, Brewin and his co-authors touted the potential of “harnessing superyachts” for science, concluding that “reaching out to wealthy citizen scientists may help fill [research capability] gaps.”

It’s a view shared — and being pushed — by the Yacht Club of Monaco and the Explorers Club, a New York City-based organization focused on exploration and science (of which, full disclosure, I am a member). In March, the groups co-hosted an environmental symposium that included an awards ceremony for yacht owners who “stand out for their commitment to protecting the marine environment.” The Archimedes won a “Science & Discovery” award.

“If a yacht is operating 365 days a year, rather than having it sit idle it’d be much better for it to contribute a positive return through science and conservation,” says Rob McCallum, an Explorers Club fellow and founder of US-based EYOS Expeditions, which runs adventure yacht voyages.

EYOS charters yachts from private owners for its excursions, and is a founding member of Yachts for Science, a four-year-old organization that matches privately owned yachts with scientists who need time at sea. (Other members include yacht builder Arksen, media firm BOAT International, and nonprofits Nekton Foundation and Ocean Family Foundation.) Yachts for Science will enable about $1 million worth of donated yacht time this year, McCallum says, a figure he expects to hit $15 million by 2029.

“There’s a personal satisfaction that we are contributing to something that is bigger than us,” says Tom Peterson, who co-owns an insurance underwriting company in California and has what he jokingly refers to as a “mini superyacht.” Every year for the past decade, Peterson has donated about 15 to 20 days of time and fuel on the 24-meter Valkyrie to scientists, who he takes out himself as a licensed captain and former scuba dive operator. He often works with the Shark Lab at California State University Long Beach, and allows researchers to stay aboard for days at a time instead of having to constantly make the 1.5-hour trip to and from shore.

To link up with scientists, Peterson works with the International SeaKeepers Society, a Florida-based nonprofit that engages the yachting community to support ocean conservation and research. “The more we understand things about the ocean in general, the better we all are in the long run,” he says.

When “superyacht” and “the environment” appear in the same sentence, it’s usually in a different context. In 2019, one study estimated that a single 71-meter superyacht has the same annual carbon footprint as about 200 cars. In 2021, another paper found that superyachts were the single greatest contributor to the carbon footprint of 20 of the world’s most prominent billionaires, accounting for 64% of their combined emissions.

“If you really want to respect the environment, you can just go surf,” says Grégory Salle, a senior researcher at the French National Centre for Scientific Research and author of the book Superyachts: Luxury, Tranquility and Ecocide. Salle is open to the idea that superyachts could be used to advance scientific research, but says it’s contradictory for anyone to buy a superyacht and claim to be truly concerned about the environment.

McCallum says people who own adventure yachts tend to be younger than your standard superyacht owner, and have a particular interest in remote and pristine places. “They’re not the sort of people that are content to just hang out in the Mediterranean or the Caribbean,” he says. “Antarctica, the Arctic, the remote Indian Ocean, the remote Pacific Ocean, the Subantarctic islands… that’s where you’re going to find us delivering our services.”

Explorer yachts aren’t the only way scientists can reach those destinations, but demand for dedicated research vessels does outstrip available supply. The US National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), arguably the world’s greatest collector of oceanographic data, has a fleet of 15 research and survey vessels for the use of its scientists. Academic researchers can also apply to use the fleet, often at a subsidized rate. But scientists request roughly 15,000 to 20,000 days of boat time every year. In 2019, NOAA was able to fill just 2,300 of them, according to an internal study.

That gap is particularly problematic as the planet warms. Oceans provide services that scientists call “existentially important,” producing more than half of the oxygen we breathe and serving as the world’s largest carbon sink. They also absorb 30% of our carbon emissions and 90% of the excess heat generated by them.

G. Mark Miller, a retired NOAA Corps officer who was in charge of several of the agency’s research vessels, has a different solution in mind when it comes to bolstering ocean research: smaller boats, fit for purpose. Superyachts can cost north of $500 million, he says; “why don’t we build a hundred $5 million vessels and flood the ocean science community?”

After leaving NOAA, Miller in 2021 launched Virginia-based Greenwater Marine Sciences Offshore with a vision of building a global fleet of research vessels and offering their use at affordable prices. He says hiring a NOAA boat can cost scientists between $20,000 and $100,000 per day. GMSO plans to charge less than $10,000 a day for most missions. The company says it’s close to acquiring its first three vessels.

Miller hopes his business model will help scientists conduct the work they need to — particularly in under-served regions like the Asia-Pacific — without worrying about getting a luxury yacht covered in “muddy worms, plankton goo, dead fish [and] whale snot.” He describes yacht owners donating boat time to scientists as “better than nothing,” and says it can help get regular people interested in science and exploration.

Christopher Walsh, captain of the Archimedes, says he and his crew love taking part in science initiatives, especially when there’s an educational component. “I get a real thrill when we can stream to the classrooms — you can’t imagine the enthusiasm the kids display,” Walsh says. “That gives me a lot of hope for the future.”","Brewin’s was not your typical superyacht itinerary, but he is one of hundreds of scientists to have used an adventure yacht — also known as expedition or explorer yachts — to conduct research on the ocean.

The Guardian,https://www.theguardian.com/business/article/2024/jun/30/boeing-justice-department-sweetheart-deal-ethiopian-lion-air,2024-06-30,21:42:16 UTC,US accused of offering Boeing ‘sweetheart deal’ over fatal crashes,"The US Department of Justice is set to charge Boeing with fraud, but plans to offer the planemaker a plea deal, according to sources familiar with the matter – have infuriated the loved ones of hundreds of passengers who died in two fatal crashes five years ago.

Boeing will be granted until the end of this week to decide whether it will plead guilty to the charge and avoid trial, officials told families of those on board the fatal Lion Air flight 610 and Ethiopian Airlines flight 302 that claimed 346 lives.

Attorneys representing the relatives accused the federal government of cooking up “another sweetheart plea deal” with Boeing. On a conference call on Sunday, one official is said to have been asked by a family member how he sleeps at night.

Relatives were briefed on the terms of the proposed deal during the call: Boeing would pay a fine, face a three-year term of probation, and work under a corporate monitor, according to two sources.

The terms unleashed a wave of anger. “The memory of 346 innocents killed by Boeing demands more justice than this,” said Paul Cassell, who represents the families of 15 crash victims.

Erin Applebaum, another attorney acting for relatives of those lost, attacked the proposal as “shameful” and said it “completely fails to mention or recognize the dignity” of the victims.

The families will make the case to a judge, and the wider public, for this deal to be rejected, Applebaum said. “And when there is inevitably another Boeing crash and DoJ seeks to assign blame, they will have nowhere else to look but in the mirror.”

The justice department did not immediately respond to a request for comment on Sunday. Boeing did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

The two crashes of Boeing’s 737 Max, in October 2018 and March 2019, killed 346 people. It prompted the worldwide grounding of the jet for almost two years.

In 2021, the justice department and Boeing reached a controversial deal that protected the company from a criminal conspiracy charge to commit fraud that arose from the two crashes.

Earlier this year, however – as the company came under intense scrutiny after a brand-new 737 Max jet was forced into an emergency landing when a cabin panel blew off mid-flight – the justice department said Boeing had breached this agreement.

The deal it has been offered “appears to be a sweetheart deal”, said Sanjiv Singh, counsel for 16 families of crash victims, citing a request for the Department of Justice to independently appoint a corporate monitor of Boeing, rather that permit the company to nominate its own candidates. “I am stunned that the department deflected our demand and fell back on ‘oh it’s policy’,” he said.

Relatives of those who died “will strenuously object to this plea deal”, said Cassell, who described the agreement as a “no-accountability-deal”.

“The deal will not acknowledge, in any way, that Boeing’s crime killed 346 people,” Cassell said. “It also appears to rest on the idea that Boeing did not harm any victim.”

Separately, as Boeing continues to grapple with the crisis triggered by January’s cabin blowout, Reuters reported on Sunday that it had agreed to buy Spirit AeroSystems – a key supplier – in a deal which values the firm at more than $4bn.","Attorneys representing the relatives accused the federal government of cooking up “another sweetheart plea deal” with Boeing.

The Guardian,https://www.theguardian.com/money/article/2024/jul/01/millions-to-pay-lower-summer-energy-bills-as-uk-price-cap-drops,2024-07-01,04:00:41 UTC,Millions to pay lower summer energy bills as UK price cap drops,"Millions of households will pay lower gas and electricity bills this summer as the energy price cap for Great Britain falls by £122 a year to the equivalent of £1,568 for the typical annual charge from today.

However, the latest cap applies only from July until the end of September, and bills are expected to rise again this winter, leaving millions struggling to heat their homes.

Monday’s adjustment reflects lower costs in the wholesale gas and electricity markets – but bills are still more than £500 a year higher than they were before Russia’s war on Ukraine upended global energy prices.

National Energy Action (NEA) has estimated that about 5.6 million households in Great Britain will remain in fuel poverty over the summer, even with lower prices.

Adam Scorer, NEA’s chief executive, said: “Any drop in energy bills is welcome, but modest falls in summer look set to be wiped out by bigger rises in autumn when people will need to put the heating back on.”

The energy price cap is expected to rise by 10% to £1,723 a year from October, according to analysts at the energy consultancy Cornwall Insight, as wholesale markets have climbed higher. It expects bills to remain at a similar level into the first months of 2025.

Analysts at the Energy and Climate Intelligence Unit (ECIU), a thinktank, have warned that energy prices are likely to remain significantly higher than they were before the Russian invasion for the rest of the decade.

The conflict has ended Europe’s gas pipeline imports from Russia, which was once its largest source of gas. This has left European markets more exposed to global energy price fluctuations as it relies more on imports from the US and the Middle East.

Europe’s gas market prices were lower in the early months of the year after a relatively mild winter, allowing energy bills to fall this summer. But markets have started to climb again, in part due to stronger gas demand from Asian economies, which will spell higher bills again this winter.

Simon Cran-McGreehin, the head of analysis at the ECIU, said: “The UK’s high dependence on gas for electricity generation and heating has cost bill payers £2,000 so far during the gas crisis, and the economy as a whole tens of billions of pounds.”

“Commonsense measures like investing in insulating the poorest homes, switching to electric heat pumps and fast-tracking British renewables will leave us less vulnerable to the whims of the international gas markets,” he said.

The consumer group Which? has urged households to take a meter reading as close to 30 June as possible “to ensure you don’t pay over the odds for any energy used after the new price cap takes effect”.

Scorer said: “Whoever is in power on 5 July inherits a fuel poverty crisis that causes misery, despair, ill-health and early death. A new government will need a new plan. Social tariffs to make energy affordable. ‘Help to repay’ programmes to reduce the debt burden. Energy efficiency schemes to build fuel poverty out of the homes of the most vulnerable.”","Millions of households will pay lower gas and electricity bills this summer as the energy price cap for Great Britain falls by £122 a year to the equivalent of £1,568 for the typical annual charge from today.

The Guardian,https://www.theguardian.com/business/article/2024/jun/30/owner-of-port-talbot-steelworks-offers-talks-to-keep-last-blast-furnace-open,2024-06-30,17:34:46 UTC,Owner of Port Talbot steelworks offers fresh talks as last furnace faces closure,"The owner of the Port Talbot steelworks has written to trade unions offering fresh talks amid a battle to delay plans to cut 2,800 jobs and suspend production at a site that has been in operation since 1951.

The Guardian understands that a letter sent on Sunday afternoon by Rajesh Nair, the UK boss of Tata Steel, has offered a new round of discussions about future investments at the company’s plants in the UK, including Port Talbot.

However, sources have said the offer to the National Trade Union Steel Coordinating Committee, which represents all three unions at the site in south Wales, is predicated on unions agreeing to suspend any future industrial action.

Tata had originally planned to close the second of its two remaining blast furnaces at the end of September, while the process of shutting down the first is due to begin in the middle of this week. Other elements that will close include the harbour, sinter plant, ore yards and primary steelmaking, bringing to a halt more than 70 years of steelmaking in Port Talbot.

The plans were brought forward after the Unite union announced indefinite strike action beginning on 8 July. Tata said it could not “safely and stably” operate the plant during any strike, and it has brought forward complete closure of the second furnace to as early as next Sunday 7 July.

The new electric furnace is not due to come onstream until 2027 and unions want steelmaking to continue until then. The Guardian understands the talks being offered would focus on future investments.

Commenting on the letter, Alun Davies, national officer for Community, the steelworkers’ union, said there were no fresh talks being proposed, and it simply reaffirmed Tata’s position agreed by the unions and Tata at their last meeting in May.

He said: “This position is that all unions will seek to conclude the negotiations on a memorandum of understanding and then put this to their members to decide whether it’s good enough.”

He added that the letter from Tata confirmed that all discussions would take place through the UK Steel Committee, which is chaired by Community’s general secretary, Roy Rickhuss.

Unite warned over the weekend that any closure would be “irreversible” and urged Tata not to “abandon” the workers employed at the plant.

It said: “We again call on the company to wait until we have a change of government, not make any irreversible decisions, and enter into meaningful negotiations.”

The shadow business secretary, Jonathan Reynolds, was reportedly in talks with the unions and Tata last week in an effort to avert the early closure.

The first minister of Wales, Vaughan Gething, and the Welsh economy secretary, Jeremy Miles, said: “The news that Tata could switch off blast furnaces 4 and 5 at Port Talbot next week is extraordinary and will cause huge anxiety for the workforce, their families and the community.

“The Welsh government cannot and will not support the closure of both blast furnaces.”

Earlier this year, Tata struck a controversial deal with the UK government, securing a £500m grant to build a greener £1.25bn electric arc furnace. However, the company wants to mothball Port Talbot during construction, leaving thousands of local people without work in a town where Tata is the main employer.

The Labour party, widely expected to win a majority in Thursday’s general election, has previously promised to invest £3bn in the UK’s steel industry in the next parliament, if elected. This would include the £500m already pledged to Port Talbot.

Last month Unite announced that its 1,500 Tata members would commence “all-out indefinite strike action” from 8 July, vowing to continue the strikes until Tata stopped its “disastrous” plan.

The Community and GMB unions, which also represent staff at Port Talbot, have said they will wait until after the election before deciding whether to strike.

Unite insisted on Saturday it would keep enough staff on site during the strike to ensure all safety procedures would be met, which would ensure the furnaces could function until September.

Tata has also now launched a legal challenge against Unite to try to avert its planned strike action, with a decision on whether it has been successful expected on Wednesday.

If that is the case, Tata could revert to its plan of closing the second furnace in September.

Unite has hit back at the legal action, saying: “Instead of waiting for a likely change of government, Tata has decided to double down, making continued threats and hiring City lawyers to try to stop industrial action on trumped-up technicalities. If they are successful, Unite will reballot. We cannot allow these steel jobs to go.”

Tata has previously said it is losing about £1m each day keeping the remaining furnaces open.

A Tata spokesperson said: “In the coming days, if we cannot be certain that we are able to continue to safely and stably operate our assets through the period of strike action, we will not have any choice but to pause or stop heavy end operations (including both blast furnaces) on the Port Talbot site.

“That is not a decision we would take lightly, and we recognise that it would prove extremely costly and disruptive throughout the supply chain, but the safety of people on or around our sites will always take priority over everything else.”","The owner of the Port Talbot steelworks has written to trade unions offering fresh talks amid a battle to delay plans to cut 2,800 jobs and suspend production at a site that has been in operation since 1951.

The Guardian,https://www.theguardian.com/politics/article/2024/jun/30/uk-and-eu-horticulture-firms-warn-of-harm-caused-by-post-brexit-border-delays,2024-06-30,17:13:36 UTC,UK and EU horticulture firms warn of harm caused by post-Brexit border delays,"Nurseries and garden centres across Britain and Europe have warned that new post-Brexit border posts are not working properly and are leading to delays, damage and significant extra costs for importers bringing plants into Britain.

The Horticultural Trade Association, which represents 1,400 garden retailers and growers in the UK, has joined forces with several European trade bodies to write an open letter to call for urgent solutions, warning the new system was adding more than 25% to import costs.

It said the checks introduced in April had held up a significant number of deliveries at the border, sometimes for as long as 44 hours, while difficulties carrying out inspections were increasing the chance of harmful pests and plant diseases entering Britain.

The new rules mean certain plant and animal products coming into Britain from the EU must now be checked at border posts situated in or nearby British ports. Previously, plants were inspected in spot checks once they had reached nurseries.

The trade bodies said the new system is causing delays and piling on costs. One haulage company said it experienced 93 hours of driver waiting time in the first week of the checks, costing it £38,000 in extra pay.

The company calculated that this would add £1.5m to its logistics bill over the next year, an increase of 25%.

Another company reported three of its trailers filled with plants were held at a border post for 44 hours after a software problem. This resulted in the majority of plants dying or wilting and the loads being rejected by the end customer.

The letter was signed by International Flower Trade Association, whose membership accounts for 80% of the total value of worldwide trade of flowers and pot plants, as well as VGB, the Dutch association of wholesalers in floricultural products.

It comes as importers are already having to deal with increased costs on moving plant and animal products to Britain because companies are now charged for inspections of goods at the border.

The letter said in some cases providers could be paying £1,740 extra to bring in a mixed load of 12 different consignments of plants, making trade unviable for many small businesses.

Under the new Brexit rules, plants for planting have been categorised as high-risk, meaning much higher rates of inspection than for businesses that import meat and dairy, which are classified as medium risk.

Importers claim the posts are too small to process goods from multiple lorries, and they said there is insufficient equipment at nearly all facilities to unload plants such as large trees or those large plants not stacked into plant trolleys.

Before the checks came in April, imported plants were held at nurseries and farms in controlled conditions before checks on site by government inspectors.

Under the new rules these checks take place almost exclusively at both government-run and privately run border posts. The government has insisted that this would enhance the country’s biosecurity by stopping harmful diseases entering the country and damaging plants and crops.

However, the letter raised concerns about the standard of checks at border posts.

It claimed loads were being “observed, rather than intensely scrutinised”, which was increasing the chance of diseases being missed, while the lack of information on what was being checked was leaving some end customers in the dark about the health of plants they received.

In one case, checks on a load of 50 mature olive trees were abandoned because of difficulties unloading. The letter said: “Olive trees are a well-known host for Xylella fastidiosa, a very high-risk and damaging bacterial disease.

“The end customer would have expected and paid for the at-border check … Yet the business received no information about what had happened and why, nor was it aware that those trees had an incomplete check.”

The government said it was working closely with traders to ensure checks are completed efficiently and swiftly, while also publishing guidance on how to reduce delays for companies.

It added that checks were handled by fully trained staff to standard operating procedures ensuring inspections were undertaken safely.

The other signatories to the letter were the European Nurserystock Association, Royal Anthos (the Dutch Association for Nursery Stock and Flower Bulbs), VBN (the Dutch Flower Auctions Association) and Transport en Logistiek Nederland (the Dutch Transport & Logistics Association).","Nurseries and garden centres across Britain and Europe have warned that new post-Brexit border posts are not working properly and are leading to delays, damage and significant extra costs for importers bringing plants into Britain.

The Guardian,https://www.theguardian.com/business/article/2024/jul/01/london-investment-bankers-bonuses-interest-rates,2024-07-01,05:00:44 UTC,London investment bankers to rake in bigger bonuses after two-year slump,"London’s investment bankers are expected to rake in bigger bonuses this financial year, as the City begins to recover from a two-year slump in deals caused by surging interest rates.

Demand for investment banking services – such as facilitating mergers and acquisitions, advising companies and governments on fundraising, and underwriting new stock and bonds – was hit by a sharp increase in borrowing rates after the pandemic, as central banks acted to tame runaway inflation. Jobs and pay were cut as investment banks sought to reduce costs.

But the rate hike cycle has ended, with the UK and US expected to begin reducing the cost of borrowing before Christmas. Forecasters say the recent increase in dealmaking is likely to be felt during the spring bonus season.

“The outlook for 2024 is brightening after a promising first quarter and there are signs of capital markets activity thawing after a two-year freeze,” Dartmouth Partners, a recruiter for recruiter for banks, consulting firms and startups, said in its annual compensation survey covering London investment bankers.

That is likely to mean bigger bonuses for investment bankers at the London offices of “bulge bracket” firms including JP Morgan, Goldman Sachs, and Deutsche Bank, rewarding those who managed to keep their jobs and wait out nearly two years of falling payouts.

“It feels like there’s more of a an upswing happening,” the Dartmouth Partners founder, Logan Naidu, told the Guardian. “Even if the revenue is not quite there, the activity is and I would suspect that compensation would go up on last year. Will it be back up to where it was in 2021-22? I doubt it is going to be that good. But I think it will be better than than last year.”

Naidu said the UK’s decision to scrap the banker bonus cap, which previously limited bonuses to 100% of salaries, would probably mean that salary rises could be replaced with larger bonuses over the long term. “What might happen is base pay starts to get a bit more suppressed, and variable comp starts to become a larger part of the narrative again, which is probably good news for the banks in terms of how they manage their cost base.”

There is still time for most investment bankers to build their bonus pots. While junior analysts will be paid out at the end of the summer, bonus decisions for higher-level staff will be made at the end of the year.

Dartmouth Partners released data showing average pay tumbled last year across most investment banking positions at eight of the major investment banks, ranging from junior-level analysts to more senior associates and vice-president roles.

While lower-paid analysts took home bonuses worth an average of £44,267 in 2023 – marking a near 50% increase compared with a year earlier – mid-tier associates’ bonus payouts fell by nearly a fifth to £80,065 on average, sending their total pay down 8.3% to £213,940.

Meanwhile, some vice-presidents had their bonuses slashed by 22% to £135,183, reducing total average pay by 11.8% to £303,204.

The survey, which interviewed more than 250 London-based bankers – working at Goldman Sachs, JP Morgan, UBS, Barclays, Morgan Stanley, Citi, Deutsche Bank and Bank of America – found that a number of bankers working at European firms were hoping to jump ship to their American rivals, which tend to offer higher overall compensation.

But even Goldman Sachs cut pay for its vice-presidents by 7.6% on average, while its associates were hit by an 8.3% drop. JP Morgan vice-presidents experienced a 7% cut and associate pay fell by 4.6%.

London-based vice-presidents at Morgan Stanley were hit by the largest drop in total pay on average last year, with it falling nearly by 26.8%, followed by Bank of America where vice-president-level pay fell 23.5%.

Global banks collectively cut more than than 600,000 jobs in 2023, making it one of the biggest years for redundancies since the 2007-08 financial crisis.

“Even though bonuses have been poor, many bankers said they are happy to still have a job,” the survey said.

The Guardian,https://www.theguardian.com/world/article/2024/jun/30/soaring-government-debt-could-roil-global-financial-markets-warns-bis-director,2024-06-30,18:57:59 UTC,"Soaring government debt could roil global financial markets, warns BIS head","Rising government debt levels could disturb global financial markets, the head of the body that advises central banks said on Sunday before France’s high-stakes parliamentary elections.

Agustín Carstens, the general manager of the Bank for International Settlements (BIS), said the world economy was on course for a “smooth landing” from the inflation crisis, but he warned that policymakers, especially politicians, needed to be careful.

Global government debt is already at record levels and elections ranging from the US presidential vote in November, to recent polls in Mexico and South Africa, and votes in France and Britain in the coming week, all carry risks.

Emmanuel Macron’s decision to call a snap election in France has sent the country’s bank stocks crashing and alarmed the bond markets, exacerbating fiscal sustainability concerns in the eurozone’s second-largest economy.

Polls released before the first round of voting on Sunday suggested the far right could win the largest share of the vote, amid record turnout.

Carstens said the BIS was not calling out any “one or two” governments but that the message was clear.

“They [governments] must cut short the rise in public debt and accept that interest rates may not return to the pre-pandemic ultra-low levels,” he said. “We need a solid foundation to build upon.”

With interest rates not about to go back to ultra-low levels, and cost pressures from ageing populations, climate breakdown and rebuilding defence capabilities, economic stimulus plans and a general rise in protectionism could unsettle sensitive markets, BIS warned as it published its annual report.

“They can surprise you with not much notice,” Carstens told reporters, pointing to the turbulence in Britain’s markets after then prime minister Liz Truss’s budget plans, which put some pension funds at risk of collapse. “You really want to avoid that.”

France’s main parties have all promised new spending. Macron’s government had promised to cut the budget deficit from 5.5% of gross domestic product last year to a European Union ceiling of 3% by 2027 – an objective that may be unattainable after the vote, which concludes with a second round on 7 July.

If it forms a government, Marine Le Pen’s National Rally (RN) wants to cut value-added tax (VAT) on energy, which it says would cost €7bn (£5.9bn) for the rest of this year and €12bn in a full year. The RN would also scrap a 2023 increase in the retirement age to 64 from 62, and says its spending plans would be paid for by cutting contributions to the EU budget.

The left-wing New Popular Front alliance, now polling second, says its first moves would include a 10% civil servant pay hike, providing free school lunches, supplies and transport while raising housing subsidies by 10%.

The turmoil has sent the cost to the French government of servicing its debt on the international markets rocketing, with the risk premium, or spread, demanded by holders of French debt over Germany’s rising to its highest level since 2012.

France’s blue-chip CAC 40 index is down 6% since Macron dissolved parliament, with French banks having been among the biggest losers. The big three – Société Générale, BNP Paribas and Crédit Agricole – are down 10%-14% since Macron’s announcement.

French banks have a large amount of debt and are expected to suffer if credit costs increase sharply.

The positive for Carstens was that central banks have successfully reined in inflation, which had hit decades-long highs after the Covid-19 pandemic, and then Russia’s 2022 invasion of Ukraine, which riled commodity markets.

“Compared to last year, I have to say we are in a much better place,” the former Mexican central bank governor said.

Although Carstens said central banks deserved praise for navigating a difficult path that could have resulted in a wave of recessions, he added that they needed to persevere, likening the inflation fight to a course of antibiotics to tackle an illness.

He described an “extreme” scenario where inflation raced up again and central banks needed to raise rates further. But that is not what the BIS expects.","Rising government debt levels could disturb global financial markets, the head of the body that advises central banks said on Sunday before France’s high-stakes parliamentary elections.

The Guardian,https://www.theguardian.com/environment/article/2024/jun/30/uk-haulage-industry-calls-for-investment-in-electric-truck-infrastructure,2024-06-30,12:41:16 UTC,UK haulage industry calls for investment in electric truck infrastructure,"The road haulage industry is calling on the new government to urgently tackle investment in infrastructure for electric trucks, after pointing out there is just one public charging point for HGVs in the whole of the UK.

Takeup of electric cars is soaring, with about 1.1m fully battery-powered cars on British roads and about 63,000 charging units in 33,000 locations, according to Zapmap data.

But the haulage industry is miles behind, with just 300 electric HGVs registered out of the country’s 500,000-strong lorry fleet, says the Road Haulage Association (RHA).

After surveying the country, the RHA found only one public charging point at which lorries can power up. It is located at a service station at Rivington, on the M61 southbound about halfway between Manchester and Preston.

Chris Ashley, policy lead on environment and vehicles at the RHA, said action was needed. He said: “All the anxieties people have with cars, whether it’s raining, whether the windscreen wipers or air conditioning are running, applies to trucks. It depends on the weather and the load.

“On average, a good range for a diesel truck would be 600 miles, with caveats of course. That is why a public charging network is necessary, in our view,” he said.

Research shows 70% of British electric trucks return to depots for recharging overnight, according to the RHA. Longer-haul journeys are impossible on batteries, which means most electric trucks are used for local deliveries within a 50- to 80-mile radius.

The size and weight of trucks means the distance they can achieve on a battery is a fraction of a car, just 200 miles.

The RHA is planning to submit 12 demands to the new government, with polls predicting a Labour win in this week’s election.

It wants the incoming government to build a trial network of HGV charging points, speed up planning applications “gummed up in the wider planning process” for HGV electricy substations at truck depots, and offer financial incentives for small and medium-sized businesses to make the switch to electric.

Trucks cannot be charged outside truckers’ homes and companies with large fleets may need substations installed to cope with the energy consumption, as trucks need at least 150KW of power, compared with a 22KW minimum for cars.

Chris Pritchett, partner and energy and mobility lawyer at the law firm Shoosmiths, said it was “crucially important” the government developed the right strategy to install the charging units at the right places.

Energy and haulage companies may even have to work together to schedule times at the units at motorway stations.

“It will require a sort of utopian level of collaboration,” said Pritchett. “The way forward is more nuanced and complex than for passenger vehicles.”

Work is already under way to tackle the shortage. Energy company Gridserve is leading a government-backed trial to roll out 200 chargers capable of delivering 350kW.

“What we need is momentum and [we’ll] see decarbonisation start to snowball,” said Ashley.

The current government plan is to phase out the sale of diesel and petrol HGVs of 26 tonnes or below by 2035 and the sale of all new HGVs heavier than that by 2040.

Then, after hopes of a free trade deal evaporated, successive Conservative governments have set their sights lower, by trying to forge closer ties with individual US states.

Now the civil servants responsible for delivering those state-level deals have been let go, in what a furious British businessman described as “an act of arson”.

Nearly a seventh of trade posts within British consulates in the US have been axed, with 24 people losing their jobs, 18 from 139 posts in the trade department. The decision was taken barely two weeks before Rishi Sunak called the general election.

Many of the trade teams, based in the nine consulates across the US, had worked on trade pacts with Kemi Badenoch, the business and trade secretary, jetting around America to sign memorandums of understanding with governors of states including Florida, Indiana and Oklahoma.

But more importantly, according to British business leaders in the US, the regional trade directors and their staff had decades of experience and had built up contacts with American businesses from Google and Meta to the heads of Hollywood studios.

Jules Ehrhardt, a designer and investor, said there was “outrage and disbelief in the British business community” at the decision.

“They are tossing out collective centuries of relational and institutional knowledge core to the UK-US trading relationship,” he said. Ehrhardt moved to the US in 2012 to open the American arm of Ustwo, a digital design studio behind award-winning games such as Monument Valley, and worked with Google, Nike and Twitter, before founding a venture capital firm, FKTRY.

He said the consulate directors had “served as the connective tissue” between British and American business leaders, making introductions, giving advice and lending their expertise. “We shot ourselves in both feet by undermining Britain’s ‘gateway to Europe’ status for American companies following Brexit, and were told to go west, and now we’ve self-elected a lobotomy,” Ehrhardt said.

“This [is an] act of arson in the final stages of this government. We claim it is a special relationship, yet remove our people at the very heart of it.”

Allan Rooney, founder of Rooney Law, which has helped more than 300 companies from the UK, Ireland and Australia enter the US market, said the directors were “absolutely critical in building strong and mutually beneficial trade relationships between UK and US businesses”.

“The facilitation of strategic introductions that these directors provide is a massive benefit,” he said. “They plug companies into a market they otherwise don’t know anything about. They familiarise them via trade missions and other methods to support and understand the market and the subtle differences between the UK and the US ‘doing business’ culture. Removing that layer will impact trade relations.

“More than a million Brits are employed by American businesses – I can’t think of a more important trade relationship post-Brexit. It’s critical. And I think the removal of a very large swathe of intellectual capital and institutional knowledge is potentially worrisome. It could strain the trade teams who are already short on resources.”

Another US-based British business executive said that there was very little stability in the UK’s consulates because they were usually staffed by Foreign & Commonwealth Office officials who stayed in the US for four-year periods. “It’s a constant revolving door,” the executive said. “Those are the people we lean on.”

William Bain, head of trade policy at the British Chambers of Commerce, said: “If we want to grow our economy then we need to boost trade, so it’s a concern if cuts are being made to the team supporting key export sectors in the US, our second largest trading partner.

“We need to scale up, not slash, our support for companies seeking to enter or raise market share in the US. This is especially true as we hope to see deals on critical minerals and digital trade reached with the US federal government in the next year or so.”

Boris Johnson, Liam Fox and other Brexiters had hoped that signing a trade deal with the US would provide economic growth for the UK, but Johnson failed to persuade either Donald Trump or Joe Biden. Last June, Rishi Sunak signed an “Atlantic declaration” with Biden which allowed UK firms access to some US subsidies.

State-level deals have seen some recognition of British professional qualifications and removed some regulatory barriers.

A UK government spokesperson said: “The UK’s trade and investment teams in America are fully focused on furthering UK interests in the US, driving investment and strengthening our trading relationship with our closest ally. We continually keep our structures under review to ensure they deliver maximum impact for the UK, ensure the highest quality service to businesses, while offering taxpayers the very best value for money.”","Nearly a seventh of trade posts within British consulates in the US have been axed, with 24 people losing their jobs, 18 from 139 posts in the trade department.

He said the consulate directors had “served as the connective tissue” between British and American business leaders, making introductions, giving advice and lending their expertise.

The Guardian,https://www.theguardian.com/business/article/2024/jun/29/rishi-sunak-smoking-ban-bill-backlash-tobacco-firms,2024-06-29,05:00:44 UTC,Revealed: how Sunak dropped smoking ban amid lobbying from tobacco firms,"Rishi Sunak abandoned his “legacy” policy to ban smoking for future generations amid a backlash from the tobacco industry in the form of legal threats, lobbying and a charm offensive aimed at Conservative MPs, an investigation reveals.

The UK had been on course to become the first country to ban smoking for future generations, via the tobacco and vaping bill, which Downing Street hoped would help define Sunak’s place in British political history.

An investigation by the Guardian and the Examination, a non-profit newsroom that investigates global health threats, has uncovered how the UK’s largest cigarette companies fought against the policy, which would have raised the smoking age by one year every year.

After months of fierce opposition from the industry – and intervention from MPs and thinktanks with ties to tobacco firms – the proposal was excluded from the “wash-up” process, when outgoing governments choose which policies to fast-track and which to drop.

The policy, which in effect banned smoking for anyone born after 2009, was left out despite MPs having voted in favour of it.

Documents and freedom of information requests reveal how four of the world’s largest tobacco firms – the UK’s Imperial Brands and British American Tobacco (BAT), Japan Tobacco International (JTI) and US-headquartered Philip Morris International (PMI) – put ministers on notice of a legal backlash.

Imperial and BAT wrote to the health secretary, Victoria Atkins, in February, to claim the consultation process preceding legislation was “unlawful” because industry views had not been considered.

The Department of Health and Social Care has said it did not need to consider industry views, pointing to guidance included in a World Health Organization global treaty, signed by the UK, that says governments should form smoking policy without influence from cigarette companies.

The Marlboro-owner PMI and JTI, which makes Camel and Benson & Hedges, said the treaty permitted interactions with cigarette firms if they were “necessary”.

Imperial, which owns Lambert & Butler and Gauloises, followed up its warning with a legal letter threatening a “judicial review” challenging the consultation process.

Government lawyers responded by saying legal action might “derail” a bill that ministers believed could save tens of thousands of lives and billions of pounds in NHS costs.

BAT, JTI and PMI were named as interested parties in Imperial’s letter, giving them the right to join as co-claimants if a judicial review went ahead.

Imperial, which sells half of all of the cigarettes smoked in the UK, has not filed court proceedings but a spokesperson said the company was “keeping the situation under review as we monitor legislative developments”.

The legal threats came after the industry opposed the legislation in its submissions to the consultation, despite claiming publicly that they wanted to phase out cigarettes.

PMI’s chief executive, Jacek Olczak, indicated in 2021 interviews that it could stop selling cigarettes in the UK within 10 years.

However, the company’s UK subsidiary told the consultation it “did not support the age of sale ban as outlined”, arguing instead for “further restrictions” on “combustible tobacco” – ie cigarettes – instead of an outright ban.

PMI told the Guardian the bill risked “confusing” consumers because it included restrictions on some smoke-free products such as vapes, adding that it “firmly believes in phasing out cigarettes, to the benefit of the 6.4 million adult smokers in the UK”.

BAT, which has previously advocated for a “smokeless” future, proposed raising the age of sale to 21 instead.

As the government pressed ahead with its plans despite opposition, tobacco firms courted rightwing and libertarian Tory MPs. In January, three months after Sunak announced his policy on smoking, the then Clacton MP, Giles Watling, attended a “business lunch” with officials from JTI. Two months later, he went to the company’s annual party at the British Museum in London.

In May, he proposed an amendment that would have replaced Sunak’s proposals with a new minimum age of 21.

“We are strongly of the opinion that engagement results in better and more informed policy and is therefore in the best interests of all relevant parties,” JTI said. Watling did not return requests for comment.

Other MPs targeted by the tobacco industry included the business secretary, Kemi Badenoch. The Imported Tobacco Products Advisory Council wrote to her in March complaining about the “open dismissal of industry views in the decision making process”.

Its secretary general, Tatiana Camacho, accused the health department of “taking a position that seems to go against the spirit of collaboration and inclusiveness”.

A month later Badenoch voted against the smoking ban at its second reading in the Commons, posting on X at the time: “The principle of equality under the law is a fundamental one … We should not treat legally competent adults differently in this way, where people born a day apart will have permanently different rights.”

Two Conservative MPs, including Badenoch’s closest political aide, also attended a lunch and drinks reception hosted by the smoking lobby group Forest, days before the tobacco bill was in effect shelved.

The Beat the Ban event, at Boisdale restaurant in Belgravia, London, featured beermats depicting Sunak as a nanny, an allusion to the ban being a “nanny state” measure.

Badenoch’s parliamentary private secretary, Alexander Stafford, attended alongside fellow Conservative MP Andrew Rosindell. Tobacco lobbyists present included Camacho and Richard Cleary, who left Badenoch’s department to join Imperial in January.

Stafford has said he does not smoke but opposed the ban as a “lover of freedom, a lover of choice and a lover of information”.

He and Rosindell did not return a request for comment.

The Forest director Simon Clark said the organisation did not seek to persuade MPs who attended to oppose the bill becoming law but did outline the group’s position in a speech.

The government also came under pressure from rightwing thinktanks funded by the tobacco industry during the consultation process.

In total, there were 307 responses in which the respondent disclosed ties to the tobacco industry, including from the Institute of Economic Affairs (IEA) and Adam Smith Institute. Both have received funding from JTI, while the IEA has also received money from Imperial and BAT.

BAT, the owner of Lucky Strike and Rothmans, said: “We are clear that combustible cigarettes pose serious health risks, and the only way to avoid these risks is not to start smoking or to quit.

“However, we do not believe that a generational sales ban will have the desired impact given the serious unintended consequences that are likely to follow, such as age verification being difficult to manage, and an increase in illicit trading.”

The Conservative party did not return requests for comment.","Rishi Sunak abandoned his “legacy” policy to ban smoking for future generations amid a backlash from the tobacco industry in the form of legal threats, lobbying and a charm offensive aimed at Conservative MPs, an investigation reveals.

The Guardian,https://www.theguardian.com/business/article/2024/jun/30/better-economic-news-will-not-stop-tories-from-suffering-their-biggest-ever-defeat,2024-06-30,10:14:41 UTC,Better economic news will not stop Tories from suffering their biggest ever defeat | Larry Elliott,"Down the years the Conservative party has taken some heavy election beatings but the one in prospect this week could be of a different order of magnitude.

Assuming the polls are right – and they have been consistent since the start of the campaign – the Tories will do worse even than in 1906, their previous nadir. Back then, the Conservatives and their Liberal Unionist allies won just 156 seats, a repeat of which on Thursday would now be considered a good result.

But in 1906, Arthur Balfour’s outgoing government secured more than 43% of the vote, while Rishi Sunak is polling at about half that level. And Balfour’s defeat could at least be attributed to a policy issue – free trade versus protectionism. Today, voters just seem sick of the Tories.

News on the economy since the election was called has had little or no impact on the polls. In part, that’s because the signals have been mixed: inflation fell back to its 2% target and growth in the first quarter of 2024 has been revised up, but the economy stagnated in April and unemployment has increased.

Living standards are certainly improving. The Resolution Foundation thinktank calculates that real per capita household disposable income – a guide to whether people are getting better off after inflation is taken into account – rose by 2.4% over the past year.

That’s the good news. The bad news is that over the 2019-24 parliament as a whole, living standards fell by 0.6% and one of the unwritten rules of political economy is that governments don’t remain popular when voters are getting poorer.

Only twice in the past century have living standards been lower at the end of a parliament than when it commenced: in 1918-22, when the UK suffered from a post-first world war boom-bust, and in the short parliament of 1950-51, when inflation rose sharply as a result of the rearmament programme for the Korean war.

In the inevitable postmortem examination that will follow the election, attention will focus on whether the Tories might have done better had Sunak delayed the election so that in time more voters would have come to think an economic corner genuinely had been turned. Another quarter or two of rising living standards would not have saved the Conservatives from defeat but it would probably have limited the scale of it.

As it is, Rachel Reeves will be the beneficiary. Analysts have been revising up their growth estimates for 2024 and 2025 on the basis that consumers will start to run down the precautionary savings they accumulated during the cost of living crisis.

Other recent developments – especially those overseas – are not so welcome. Joe Biden’s poor performance in his head to head debate with Donald Trump has made it more likely that the latter will win the US presidential election. Tariffs will be raised and taxes will be cut if that happens, threatening higher inflation and rising debt.

Meanwhile, the first round of voting in France’s parliamentary election looks set to show sizeable gains for Marine Le Pen’s rightwing National Rally party and a defeat for Emmanuel Macron’s centrist government.

Events in both the US and France highlight how things have changed in the near decade and a half since Labour was last in power.

Most obviously, the world has become a less safe place. The war between Ukraine and Russia is now well into its third year and has shattered the notion that permanent peace can be guaranteed for western developed nations. There are always demands for Labour governments to spend more on the NHS and on the welfare state. This time there will also be pressure to raise defence spending.

Globalisation has gone into retreat. Weak growth since the financial crisis of 2008-09 has seen a marked increase in protectionist measures – not just on goods but on people too. In Europe, North America and Australasia alike there have been demands for governments to restrict the number of foreign nationals entering the country.

What’s more, multilateral bodies are for the most part weaker than they were in 2010. The increasingly fractious relationship between the US and China means the G20 group of leading developed and developing nations cannot agree on much. The World Trade Organization is a much-diminished institution, unable to fulfil either of its core functions: to negotiate multilateral trade deals and be the final arbiter in trade disputes. The EU is having to contend with rising nationalist sentiment, a function of feeble economic performance and a reaction against rule by unelected technocrats.

The developing world has been even harder hit by Covid and the cost of living crisis than the rich west, increasing the incentive for migrants to look for a better life elsewhere. Yet aid budgets have been cut and promises to help poor countries cope with the impact of climate change have not been fulfilled. The world is getting hotter and the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank urgently need more money to meet demands for their assistance.

So those are the sort of challenges that Labour will face when it takes office later this week. Not the world of 1997, when Russia was seen as an ally rather than a strategic threat. Not the middle of the Great Moderation – the period between the fall of communism and the global financial crisis – when the west enjoyed year after year of growth and low inflation, but rather a world still trying to claw its way out of the Great Stagnation of the past 15 years.

And an angrier world where voters can quickly turn on their governments. Labour should enjoy its honeymoon period. It might not last long.","And Balfour’s defeat could at least be attributed to a policy issue – free trade versus protectionism.

The Guardian,https://www.theguardian.com/politics/article/2024/jun/29/transport-labour-tories-potholes-hs2-rail-road-pricing,2024-06-29,08:00:46 UTC,"From potholes to HS2, transport gets voters going – but some solutions are unsayable","Better railways, safer roads, cleaner fuels: in another decade, they would be the kind of transport issues commanding a pragmatic consensus in British politics.

But this election lands with transport wildly politicised, with clean air, speed limits and high-speed rail all dragged into the wider culture wars.

Meanwhile, transport has become emblematic of decline and the fraying public realm, from failing rail services to the potholes that pockmark Britain’s tarmac.

So what might the election resolve – and what are the transport policies deemed too difficult to sell?

The culture war battleground: drivers, Ulez and HS2

One of Keir Starmer’s less convincing recent repositionings may have been declaring Labour “the only party on the side of drivers” – a response to the long Conservative campaign to hammer home its backing for “people’s freedom to use their cars”.

The Tory plan for motorists was first outlined by the transport secretary, Mark Harper, in 2023 in a conference speech that appeared to echo online conspiracy theories about 15-minute cities, and signalled a clear move away from some of the urban planning measures the government had backed during Covid.

Now the party’s manifesto highlights its “backing drivers bill” in a chapter dedicated to “strengthening our communities”, pledging to curb low-traffic neighbourhoods (LTNs) and 20mph zones and reverse the expansion of London’s ultra-low emission zone (Ulez) – an unpopular move pinned firmly on Labour via the mayor, Sadiq Khan, despite the government’s own part in setting it up.

The rhetoric of ending a “war on motorists” is shared in Reform UK’s manifesto, which would scrap 20mph speed limits, LTNs and the Ulez, along with net zero commitments to transition from fossil fuel to electric vehicles.

Campaigners are concerned by the inflammatory language. Silviya Barrett, policy and research director of the Campaign for Better Transport (CBT), says: “We’re all more than just a driver, just a cyclist – we all need a range of means by which to move. Many drivers use buses and trains too, many walk their kids to school, and most drivers are keen to have more options.”

Another headline Conservative promise is to “stop road pricing”, implicitly accusing Labour of planning a pay-per-mile scheme. Starmer’s party has not backed any such policy, even though transport experts – including motoring organisations – believe some such scheme eventually must come.

Beyond roads, HS2 has perhaps been the only other transport issue as divisive. Scrapping the entire route, including that already half-built from London to Birmingham, is Reform’s headline transport policy, whose back-of-an-envelope calculations claim to save another £25bn.

Any mention of HS2 is conspicuously absent from Labour’s manifesto, while the Conservatives’ reiterates the derided “Network North” mixture of schemes funded by a putative £36bn saving from axing HS2’s northern leg. Only a lonely Liberal Democrat paragraph proposes finding a way to rekindle the high-speed railway to Manchester and beyond.

The post-election action areas: rail reform – and potholes

Despite the fate of the UK’s biggest engineering project, both big parties are pledging to speed up infrastructure delivery, with a Labour review under the ex-Siemens boss Jürgen Maier claiming both time and money could be saved.

But the humble pothole is perhaps focusing more minds: as Labour’s manifesto puts it, “the potholes cratering our roads are a visible sign of the decline after 14 years of Conservative rule”. The Tories have already earmarked £8bn to fill roads instead of building HS2. And even in a Labour manifesto where additional spending is all but forbidden, an extra £65m a year for potholes will be found by putting off a road-building scheme, the planned A27 bypass in West Sussex.

A bigger Labour pledge, but one that it argues is cost-free, is immediate rail reform, with the shadow transport secretary, Louise Haigh, promising “the biggest overhaul to our railways in a generation”.

Labour can afford to go large on reform plans that in many ways align with the Conservatives’ own belated attempts to force through change. Even what might once have been regarded as an ideological red line between the parties – partial renationalisation of rail – has been reluctantly enacted under the current government, as franchising collapsed and more train operators were taken into public hands.

Whoever wins, a new Great British Railways with a shake-up of the railway’s structure and fares is promised. The “guiding mind” will have plenty to work at: latest annual figures from the rail regulator, the Office of Rail and Road, show that only 85% of trains were officially on time (ie within five or 10 minutes of schedule) in 2023-24 – the worst performance in 19 years.

A critical task will be to end the disruption from rail’s long-running industrial relations standoff. While the Conservatives recommit to the ill-fated minimum service levels legislation, Labour makes no direct mention of the strikes, but a manifesto laced with references to working in partnership with unions to “end chaos” suggests a possible reset.

Off limits: road pricing and curbing flying

The vast majority of taxation from motoring comes from fuel duty paid via the petrol pump: about £27bn in annual Treasury revenue destined to dwindle and vanish as cars turn electric. For many transport experts, some form of road pricing appears inevitable and the fairest system. Politics, however, is likely to rule it out.

“Road pricing is toxic because it is very complicated,” says Steve Gooding, director of the RAC Foundation, who was once tasked as a civil servant with drawing up a plan that produced enormous public backlash. “People think – ‘I’m not driving in the rush hour because I like it, but because my employer wants me to turn up’.”

Barrett and the CBT have proposed a 2p per km charge for electric cars to make sure all drivers contribute to the exchequer. Gooding counsels that any scheme should be as simple as possible, citing the kind of pay-per-mile schemes being introduced in Iceland and New Zealand. He adds: “The dilemma is the government wants you to buy an electric car – but how do you do that if you charge people to drive it?”

But, he says: “I would be flabbergasted if someone in the Treasury building isn’t already doing that calculation. We all think this charge is coming. The sooner you are honest about it, the sooner people can factor it into their decisions.”

However, parties appear to be shying away from even the lip service paid to future net zero commitments. A Greenpeace/Friends of the Earth manifesto analysis scores the Conservatives on 1.5 out of 10 on transport, compared with 4.5 for Labour and 8.5 and 9 for the Lib Dems and Greens respectively.

Tackling aviation emissions is a harder, and could be even less electorally popular to fix than the transition for cars. The Lib Dems and Greens espouse some kind of frequent flyer levy, a ban on short domestic flights where a rail alternative exists, and increased taxation, on private jets in particular. Both main parties affirm support for the sector and its dubious solution of sustainable aviation fuels.","But this election lands with transport wildly politicised, with clean air, speed limits and high-speed rail all dragged into the wider culture wars.
Meanwhile, transport has become emblematic of decline and the fraying public realm, from failing rail services to the potholes that pockmark Britain’s tarmac.
Starmer’s party has not backed any such policy, even though transport experts – including motoring organisations – believe some such scheme eventually must come.
Beyond roads, HS2 has perhaps been the only other transport issue as divisive.
Scrapping the entire route, including that already half-built from London to Birmingham, is Reform’s headline transport policy, whose back-of-an-envelope calculations claim to save another £25bn.","['rail', 'voters', 'hs2', 'scheme', 'unsayable', 'going', 'potholes', 'gets', 'manifesto', 'labour', 'roads', 'policy', 'solutions', 'parties', 'transport', 'electric', 'drivers']",https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/657a827cbe8cf4949a7fe8a2cf2d90303e5f6556/1094_1086_5284_3171/master/5284.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=a6cd55b972d0c53ca2403eabc790a3ee,False,better railway safer road cleaner fuel anoth decad would kind transport issu command pragmat consensus british polit elect land transport wild politicis clean air speed limit highspe rail drag wider cultur war meanwhil transport becom emblemat declin fray public realm fail rail servic pothol pockmark britain 's tarmac might elect resolv -

The Guardian,https://www.theguardian.com/business/article/2024/jun/29/will-rising-debt-cause-thames-water-to-sink-under-a-labour-government,2024-06-29,08:00:46 UTC,Will rising debt cause Thames Water to sink under a Labour government?,"If Labour triumphs in this week’s election, as polls suggest, then top of the incoming business secretary Jonathan Reynolds’s in-tray will be the possible collapse of Thames Water. The Thames timebomb is ticking – and could explode before new MPs have even become fully acquainted with the corridors of Westminster.

To recap, Britain’s biggest water company has been labouring under an £18bn debt mountain and has become the chief target of mounting anger from the public and politicians towards the industry over sewage spills, executive pay and shareholder payouts.

In March, Thames investors refused to stump up a pledged £500m of emergency funding amid a standoff with the industry regulator, Ofwat. So acute are concerns that the government has tasked officials with making contingency plans for a temporary renationalisation, codenamed Project Timber.

Its finances were back in the spotlight this week, when the Guardian revealed that a £150m dividend paid out from the regulated company on 27 March – hours before investors pulled the plug – was being examined by Ofwat. An internal party dossier by Labour’s chief of staff, Sue Gray, seen by the Financial Times, put the company’s potential collapse high on the party’s “risk register” after taking power, alongside prison overcrowding, bankrupt councils and an NHS funding shortfall.

One of the first tests will be the postponed publication of Ofwat’s proposals for the water industry on 11 July. The regulator had been due to release its draft “price review 24” – the process by which it determines how much each company can charge customers over the following five years – on 12 June, but the pivotal moment was delayed by Rishi Sunak’s soggy early election announcement.

Thames’s own five-year plan, submitted in October and updated in April, is at the heart of its standoff with shareholders, who fear Ofwat’s response to it will be too stringent. The company has promised an extra £1.1bn to tackle environmental issues on top of the £18.7bn already pledged, to be paid for in part by raising bills 59%, including inflation. The regulator has indicated it is reluctant to impose large increases on struggling households.

Investors will be combing Ofwat’s draft for an indication on the weighted average cost of capital it will allow companies, allowing them to calculate their returns. Last time round, some water firms successfully appealed Ofwat’s findings to the Competition and Markets Authority.

The documents will also be scrutinised to see whether the regulator will allow companies to build less than they promised, or the same projects at a cheaper cost, amid an industry pledge to spend £96bn on infrastructure, from new reservoirs to sewage treatment plants.

Thames, which serves about 16m households, is also due to publish its much anticipated annual results imminently. Sources said they were keen to examine whether the accounts, and those of the diverse collection of companies in Thames’s complex group structure, will be signed off on a going-concern basis, and whether they include a “material uncertainty” statement, as last year’s figures from parent company Kemble did. A source said the accounts were expected to be signed off at a board meeting on Friday and published by 15 July.

Investors hope the various publications could clarify the prospects for the group. Options still include a complex restructure, a debt-for-equity swap and a government-handled special administration – in effect a temporary renationalisation.

A source close to Kemble’s creditors said: “Obviously, the draft determinations are just a draft, but it will spark some activity.”

Colm Gibson, managing director at Berkeley Research, said: “Analysts and investors should be wary of reading too much into Ofwat’s draft determinations, as there is scope for Ofwat’s position to move materially before final determinations are revealed in December.”

He added: “Water companies have proposed large increases in their investment programmes just as they will face increased competition for staff and supply chain resources from the energy industry’s net zero programme, and a new government keen to invest in schools, hospitals, transport and other national … infrastructure. It will be interesting to see how this is taken into account in prices.”

This week, Reynolds said he “wouldn’t want to see a nationalisation” of Thames. “I think there should be a solution that involves [something] short of that,” he told an event in the City of London, without specifying what that solution might be.

Unfortunately for him, a testing financial squeeze at Thames may banish any post-victory party atmosphere before the balloons have even deflated.","If Labour triumphs in this week’s election, as polls suggest, then top of the incoming business secretary Jonathan Reynolds’s in-tray will be the possible collapse of Thames Water.

The Guardian,https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/article/2024/jun/30/labour-needs-billions-to-fund-its-plans-and-i-know-where-it-can-be-found,2024-06-30,08:00:16 UTC,Labour needs billions to fund its plans – and I know where it can be found | Will Hutton,"Since its foundation in 1900, the Labour party has had a Janus-headed attitude to capitalism. It needs capitalism to be successful, dynamic and job creating, even while it instinctively distrusts capitalism, with its capacity to generate extreme inequality, invest too little, cut corners and treat workers exploitatively. But its past efforts at improving things – nationalisation, top-down planning, championing strong trade unions or simply (as New Labour did) largely giving capitalism its head – have not been notably successful. It has been a standoff that the Conservative party has ruthlessly exploited.

The seismic importance of 4 July is that Conservatism’s approach to wealth generation – trying to shrink the state whose size and excess taxes supposedly “crowds out” suppressed investment and enterprise – is exposed as a dead end of stagnant living standards and eviscerated public services. Keir Starmer, boxed in by this dreadful legacy, has declared that Labour will become the party of growth and wealth generation. Only thus can sustained tax revenues be generated to repair the ravages of the past 14 years. My bet is that he has a better than even chance of pulling it off – and transforming Labour into Britain’s natural party of government.

His first advantage is that the economic evidence is unambiguous: the state does not “crowd out” investment, and low taxes do little to stimulate enterprise. What capitalism needs from the state is well-designed and stable policy that proactively manages the business cycle while “crowding in” innovation, infrastructure and abundant fit-for-purpose training, and shapes the savings system to deliver buoyant company share prices – the necessary if insufficient precondition for raising capital to enable higher investment and a startup and scale-up boom.

This is becoming the new common sense in business, finance and the financial markets. It is why investors are buying shares anticipating a Labour government, and why Dame Amanda Blanc, CEO of Aviva, suggested last week that there could be as much as £100bn from UK insurers ready to flow into business investment if chancellor Rachel Reeves can deliver her promises on stability. That alone would go some way to lift British public and private investment by £100bn every year – the scale of the gap between us and our major competitors – while not risking another Liz Truss-style fiasco.

One important avenue to growth, cited in the Labour manifesto, is the prospect of unleashing some of the £1.4tn funds fossilised in Britain’s 5,100 defined benefit pension fund schemes. Linked to a generous fraction of workers’ final year’s pay, they have become a financial burden. To wind them up, companies have closed them to new members, creating a £1.4tn universe of wholly risk-averse zombie funds. They need to be consolidated into bigger funds that can take risks – and the money made to work to accelerate Britain’s investment recovery.

There is the tool to hand. One of the most startling policy successes of the past 20 years has been New Labour’s Pension Protection Fund (PPF), established in 2005, which takes over the management of distressed defined benefit pension funds, guaranteeing the future pensions. Managed with great professionalism, the PPF has already consolidated more than 1,100 pension funds and is currently worth £33bn with a £12bn investment surplus – one of the most successful funds of its type globally in securing high investment performance. Industry insiders believe that there is another £600bn locked up in small, high-cost zombie funds that could be liberated for productive investment.

The first staging post would be to scale up the current PPF to at least £100bn. Conservative objections that this would leave the pension funds with no fiscal backstop can be easily overcome; backed by the state, the PPF will become the new backstop via a guarantee that does not score as public borrowing. Nor, because the PPF is so rich, would the state ever be at risk. Reeves will be on her way.

Britain would have an investment trio of financial institutions dedicated to multibillion-pound economic development

After all, such a guarantee is already delegated to the UK Infrastructure Bank (UKIB) to underwrite £10bn of commercial bank lending on infrastructure projects. Reeves should lift the facility to £50bn. A similar guarantee would enable the British Business Bank (BBB) to offer venture debt to startups and scale-ups, and seek out promising companies to back: there is an estimated annual shortage of up to £10bn of venture lending that needs to be closed. My understanding is that a scaled-up PPF would support both the UKIB and BBB; at a stroke, Britain would have equipped itself with an investment trio of financial institutions dedicated to serious multibillion-pound economic development and resultant growth – without additional direct government borrowing. It’s a fiscal get-out-of-jail-free card.

Against this background, Reeves can use her proposed rewriting of the fiscal rules to supplement public investment directly. The Financial Times recently reported that asset managers would buy an extra £20bn-£30bn of government debt if it were earmarked for investment projects and R&D. Altogether, the UK’s growth rate could accelerate to above 2.5% by the end of the parliament, with even the dropped £28bn target for green spending met. Growth would be higher again the more Britain regained access to lost EU markets.

In the near future, before growth kicks in, Starmer and Reeves may have to increase the current yields from capital gains, inheritance and council tax by up to another 1% of GDP. But overall there will be the funds to resuscitate education, the NHS, local government, defence, the criminal justice system, the arts and welfare. Do I dream? Some commitments are in the manifesto, others set out in Reeves’ Mais lecture in March, others have not been excluded during the election campaign, and the ambitious teams in the investment trio are all standing by for the call.

Some in the Treasury will oppose. And never underestimate the conservatism and parochialism of the pension fund world. Geopolitics may kill all hopes. But Britain under Labour could at last fulfil its economic promise and build a high-investment, inclusive, high-wage capitalism that treats its workers fairly. This time, no mistakes.","Since its foundation in 1900, the Labour party has had a Janus-headed attitude to capitalism.

The Guardian,https://www.theguardian.com/business/article/2024/jun/30/the-baby-bust-how-britains-falling-birthrate-is-creating-alarm-in-the-economy,2024-06-30,10:00:21 UTC,The baby bust: how Britain’s falling birthrate is creating alarm in the economy,"Having children has become an unaffordable luxury for many of her generation, says Vanessa, a 35-year-old project manager living in Brighton.

“My friends who managed to start a family, without exception, all received large sums of money from their parents to get on the property ladder. For those of us not fortunate enough, we are trapped in the rental market, largely with insecure, poorly paid employment.”

Vanessa’s outlook is also clouded by concerns about the climate crisis, crumbling public services and the “plummeting mental health of young people”, she says. “Put these into the mix and you have a perfect storm for declining birthrates.”

Her decision is replicated worldwide. The number of women of child-bearing age is in long-term decline across Europe, parts of Asia, South America and the US, a situation made worse by the steep drop in the number of women, and their partners, who either want or are able to have children.

These factors have led to a sharp fall in fertility rates – the number of children born to each woman.

While the issues facing governments from rapidly ageing populations are relatively familiar, a decline in fertility rates that was once limited to Japan has spread across the world. Today, almost every continent has a growing age-dependency ratio as average birthrates fall and people live longer. If the global population hits 10.4 billion in the 2080s as predicted, it will only be because sub-Saharan Africa has continued on its current trend, pushing the population across the African continent from about 1.5 billion to as many as 2.5 billion.

Here we look at the trends, and the implications for future governments, of a demographic revolution.

How the UK is affected

The total fertility rate across England and Wales fell to 1.49 children per woman in 2022, from 1.55 in 2021, according to the Office for National Statistics (ONS).

As a benchmark, the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) says that to maintain a population, the “replacement rate”, often known as the “R-rate”, needs to be at least 2.1 children per woman.

It has been well documented that the pandemic, rather than spark a baby boom, had the reverse effect. Yet the recent drop in fertility has shocked demographers. The rate was already declining, starting in 2010: then came Covid-19, the Russian invasion of Ukraine and a deepening of the climate crisis, which all appeared to add a further downward shift, taking the fertility rate to the lowest since comparative data began being kept in the 1930s.

Ann Berrington, a professor of demography and social statistics at Southampton University, says: “The Human Fertility Database covering England and Wales documents the 1960s baby boom, 1970s baby bust, the fluctuations of the 1980s and 1990s that kept things fairly stable, increases through 2000s to 2010, and then a decline to the historical low levels seen today.”

The trend in Scotland follows the same pattern, but on a lower trajectory during each period over the last 60 years. Northern Ireland follows the same pattern on a slightly elevated path. ONS figures tracking live births tell the same story of decline. They show 605,479 in England and Wales in 2022, a 3.1% fall from 2021 and the lowest number since 2002.

This figure is not an all-time low because the UK’s population has been expanding since 2003, when the UK embraced the free movement of people from countries that had recently joined the EU. Opening its doors to workers from eastern Europe resulted in an increase in total births, and maintained fertility rates, which were about the same for UK-born and foreign-born women at the time.

But when record numbers of women are reaching the age of 30 child-free, the effect has clearly waned.

According to the latest data, half of women born in 1990 were childless by their 30th birthday – the first generation for which that is true.

It’s the economy …

When the Observer asked readers, including Vanessa, to say why they had not had children, or had restricted the size of their family, most replied that financial constraints were the main reason.

Hannah, a 35-year-old marketing executive living in London, says she had been unable to have the two children she wanted with her partner of 10 years, despite moving to a cheaper area to secure a bigger home.

Childcare costs were prohibitively high, along with other costs of living, she says. “The family we want to have is financially out of reach. We have only ever had one holiday together since our relationship began. We are cutting down on food bills and looking for extra work to make having a child happen.” She and her partner are considering moving abroad.

In the early 00s, Britain and France were outliers in Europe. Both countries had generous family benefits and governments with a stated aim of supporting children. The scale of generosity, from tax credits for low earners to an expansion of early years centres and childcare subsidies, meant both countries – under Labour in the UK and the Gaullist centre-right in France – arrested declines over previous decades.

In the UK and France, these subsidies were scaled back after the recessions of 2008-09. Austerity across all public services was the message from Nicolas Sarkozy, France’s president from 2007 to 2012, and from the UK ’s coalition government from 2010 to 2015.

For all the impact of welfare and public service cuts, a study by Fathom Consulting indicates those interested in creating a family look further ahead. In the aftermath of the financial crash of 2008, it was clear the future for many households looked bleak, with incomes flat and costs, especially housing, on a steady incline. Without the optimism of previous generations, couples decided not to have children, according to the initial findings from a study of Japan that links declines in fertility with periods when the future outlook for the economy was uncertain.

“It turns out that there is a good relationship between forecasts of 15-year forward growth in Japan at any point in time and the fertility rate in Japan at the same point in time,” says the report.

“In other words, people have kids when they feel optimistic that, when their kids join the workforce, the standard of living they will enjoy will be better than it is now.”

To measure growth, the report used national income per capita, which has improved in Japan while the overall economy has stagnated. Japan’s fertility rate is 1.3, just ahead of Italy’s 1.2 and South Korea’s 0.8.

The consultancy’s director, Erik Britton, says the research is ongoing and the conclusions only tentative, but the initial findings reveal that government support, while a necessary element, might not be the most important factor. A nation confidently growing its economy is the comfort people need before starting a family, he says.

… but also other factors

Recent data from the UK Generations and Gender Survey tells us that the ideal family size remains relatively high, with an average of about two children. There remains evidence of a two-child family ideal.

Berrington says that when her team asked childless people whether they intend to have children, there was “a lot of uncertainty in the answers”. Higher proportions of young adults said they probably or definitely would not have children, as compared with the proportions reported by millennials at a similar age.

Fiona Powley, 49, a life coach, knew she did not want children by the age of 12, and knows many contemporaries who also prefer to be child-free; she runs the group Bristol Childfree Women. As an indication of the problem faced by any government seeking to boost fertility, she says that when she asks people as they join her community what they enjoy most about being child-free, “they talk about time and freedom: finances don’t usually feature”.

She adds: “A common judgment from others asks ‘who will look after you when you’re old?’, to which most members might say they’ve made good financial provision for older-age care and pensions as they’ve not have the financial strain of children.”

Sarah Harper, a professor of gerontology at Oxford University, says one of the main issues is equality, meaning equal treatment by the state and within a relationship.

It is only when women believe they can continue working and have spare time that they will take the plunge into motherhood, she says – though the evidence from the Nordic countries, where fertility rates have followed the general downward trend, is weak. However, it might explain why traditional South Korea’s fertility rate is so low.

“These days women say they have no obligation to reproduce and ‘I’m not going to have a baby who turns my life upside down’,” says Harper, who advised the David Cameron’s government on the implications of an ageing society.

Public services

The Treasury’s independent forecaster, the Office for Budget Responsibility (OBR), says falling birthrates are going to have a negative effect on tax receipts. That is a situation that is not necessarily solved by higher immigration.

In a recent report, it said that while every additional migrant generally boosts the level of output in the economy, “the size of this impact and the effect on per-person living standards is highly uncertain.

“The age, education, skill level, and participation rate of migrants, alongside the investment response of businesses, are all factors that determine the impact of migration on per-person output,” it said.

At the moment, the UK population is increasing – by an estimated 6.6 million to 73.7 million over the next 15 years – but the economy is on course to grow at a slower pace, meaning there is less of the financial pie to go around.

Without a healthy rise in tax receipts, governments will struggle to pay for vital services.

Schools are in the frontline of cuts as pupil numbers decline, according to the Resolution Foundation. In England, they could lose up to £1bn in funding by 2030, with exceptional falls in pupil numbers prompting closures as some establishments cease to be financially viable. Councils across the country have begun to consult local residents about mergers and closures to make the system viable.

According to the Education Policy Institute (EPI), a thinktank, the north-east is projected to see the greatest decline in primary pupil numbers, down 13% by 2028-29.

Primary school teachers could face redundancy, such is the dramatic loss of young children, says Lindsey Macmillan, an education policy expert at University College London. She says secondary schools that are now suffering teacher shortages will see the gap close as classes are cut and schools merged.

Pupil numbers had grown because of a fertility surge in the 00s, but that cohort has moved through primary and on to secondaries, leaving empty seats in their wake.

Looking ahead, even with real terms increases in per-pupil funding over the remainder of the decade, the EPI predicts that many schools will suffer funding cuts due to fewer pupils causing income to fall, though costs will remain high.

What about ageing?

Plenty of questions arise over the fact that the birthrate is falling while medical improvements are helping older people live longer. Will robots be able to look after elderly people? Could a new social contract between young and old give millennials and gen Z the security and encouragement they need to have more children? And can the UK import all the missing labour it needs, such as from sub-Saharan Africa, where births are expected to be higher?

Nik Lomax, a professor of population geography at Leeds University, says one problem faced by the next government will be how different regions are affected.

“One way of thinking about the implications of this is to assess the old-age dependency ratio – the number of people of retirement age for every 1,000 people of working age,” he says. “This reveals striking differences by geography, and will get larger over time as the number of old people relative to working age people increases.”

Just as fertility rates are falling fastest in the north-east, Wales, the south-west and parts of the Midlands, the dependency ratio is increasing in these regions too.

Harper says a clear trend shows fewer people entering the workforce and older people living longer, and not necessarily in good health.

“Men in areas that rank in the lowest third by average incomes will live until they are 80, but spend their 70s in ill health,” she says. “Men who live in the top third of affluent areas will live until their late 80s and won’t be ill or have a disability, on average, until they are 80.”

Harper says the Cameron government put ageing into its industrial strategy and considered many of the implications of falling birthrates and rising levels of ill health among a growing number of over-65s. But the industrial strategy and policy initiatives were later jettisoned.

Given that we are not going to change the dynamics of fertility rates and have women go back to producing three to four children, we need to extend people’s lives in a healthy way, Harper says.

Berrington says the implications for policymaking are “very significant – for example, the short-term decline in demand for childcare, maternity services and other parts of the economy that depend on people buying goods and services for children. “Policy responses to low fertility have tended to focus on ways to increase fertility,” she says. “However, many pronatalist policies do not work, especially cash benefits, as they tend to just bring forward in time births that would happen anyway, and not increase the overall number of births.”

Pronatalist policies – those that attempt to boost the birthrate – are also often problematic in terms of entrenching gender inequality and reducing reproductive freedom.

A report by the Social Market Foundation thinktank in 2021 said the tens of billions of pounds it would take to support an expansion of family welfare could be better spent. “We do not recommend that the government pursues a distinct ‘population strategy’ to increase the birthrate. However, the government should convene a cross-departmental working group to examine how different policies affect the birthrate,” it said.

Berrington says healthy ageing is crucial to the prospects for the economy, providing more workers and helping fill the state’s coffers.

“And governments will need to look to other policy solutions, such as increasing employment among groups which for different reasons – poor mental wellbeing, or because they have young children – have relatively high inactivity rates.”","These factors have led to a sharp fall in fertility rates – the number of children born to each woman.
While the issues facing governments from rapidly ageing populations are relatively familiar, a decline in fertility rates that was once limited to Japan has spread across the world.
Japan’s fertility rate is 1.3, just ahead of Italy’s 1.2 and South Korea’s 0.8.
However, it might explain why traditional South Korea’s fertility rate is so low.

The Guardian,https://www.theguardian.com/money/article/2024/jul/01/we-couldnt-see-a-thing-in-our-vip-taylor-swift-seats,2024-07-01,06:06:29 UTC,We couldn’t see a thing in our VIP Taylor Swift seats,"Last July, I paid AXS £2,649 for four tickets for the Taylor Swift concert in Liverpool this month as a treat for my daughters. When they arrived, they found their view of the stage completely blocked by a tent and large items of technical equipment shrouded in black plastic.

They asked to be moved and were put in the very back corner next to fans who had paid a fraction of what I had.

AXS appears to be ignoring my email suggesting they sold tickets that were not as described.

ST, Gloucester

The premium package you purchased promised “unforgettable seats” along with branded merchandise. A restricted view was not mentioned, either, on the sales page or the confirmation. “Unforgettable”, at least, was an accurate description. Your daughters say they will never forget the disappointment.

AE of Faversham, Kent fears her Taylor Swift tickets in August will be similarly memorable, for she too has booked VIP seats, paying over £1,320 for two.

Feedback and photos from friends and social media suggest that she has also invested in a view of a large tent and bulky sound equipment.

“From the row we’ve been allocated, it looks as though we’ll just about be able to see the screen but nothing else,” she writes. “I’ve asked AXS for the VIP tickets we were sold – with a view of the stage – but have had no response and neither have friends who have already attended the concert and found they could see nothing.”

Other furious fans have reported on social media that their premium seats were barricaded behind stage equipment. The tent that blocks the view, ironically, is to lodge celebrity guests who probably get their tickets gratis.

Seats with a restricted view are supposed to be advertised as such, and priced accordingly. The venues are vast, and the stage viewed from the seated areas is always going to be in the far distance. But it’s an outrage fans have seemingly been misled into paying for a first-class experience when the stage configuration prevents them seeing it at all.

Neither AXS nor its sister ­company AEG Presents, the organiser of the tour, responded to my request for comment. They don’t need to. Performances are a sellout, with fans prepared to pay any money to get a seat.

ST’s next option is to make a claim for breach of contract and statutory rights via the small claims court, now Money Claim Online. The Consumer Rights Act states that purchases must be as described and fit for purpose, and ST can claim the difference between the price she paid, and the price of the seats her daughters ended up in. According to consumer lawyer Gary Rycroft, she can also try claiming for damages.

AE’s situation is less clear-cut, he says, since she has not yet attended the concert. “If the retailer offers a full refund, the logic is she will either have to agree, or not,” he says. “A cynical retailer may take a view that Swifty is in such demand they can easily sell on a refunded ticket at a similar price with full disclosure of the restricted view.”

On the night, you could demand to be moved, citing the Consumer Rights Act, and take photos of the blocked view to support any claim.

The Guardian,https://www.theguardian.com/money/article/2024/jun/29/unpaid-uk-carers-financial-hit-income-benefits-bills,2024-06-29,06:00:49 UTC,Unpaid UK carers ‘face financial hit that can last decades’,"People who look after family members free of charge are taking a huge hit to their finances which could continue into their retirement as they find themselves unable to balance paid work with their caring commitments.

Recent analysis of official figures by the financial firm Just Retirement found seven in 10 people who were receiving carer’s allowance were not in paid work, and missing out on earnings and private pension contributions.

Andresearch last year by the charity Carers UK found that 40% of those providing high levels of care for an ill, elderly or disabled relative or friend had left their employment, while 22% had reduced their working hours.

“Too often for unpaid carers in work, the immense stresses and challenges of the role with little support can mean having to reduce working hours or come out of the workplace altogether,” says Helen Walker, the chief executive of Carers UK. “This can have a significant impact on household finances, exacerbated by the current cost of living crisis.”

With just days to go until the election, the party that looks most likely to take power has said very little about what it would do to help the UK’s army of unpaid carers. The Labour manifesto does not include a single mention of the word “carer”. The Conservative manifesto does include a few brief mentions. Only the Liberal Democrats have put forward substantial proposals for better support.

Carer’s allowance is now worth £81.90 a week and is available to people who provide at least 35 hours a week of care to a disabled person.

Carers UK has been conducting an annual survey for several years, each time asking people about the impact of their role on their finances. Last year, it found 75% of those receiving carer’s allowance were struggling with cost-of-living pressures, with almost half cutting back on essentials including food and heating. The proportion saying that they were struggling to make ends meet had risen to 45%, from 39% in 2022.

The survey found that 72% were worried about the financial hit from expenses linked to caring, such as petrol for hospital visits, heating and specific dietary requirements.

Those who were employed worked in low-paid jobs as a result of the strict rules around carer’s allowance. An earnings limit means you do not qualify if you earn more than £151 a week – after that, you lose the entire benefit. The Guardian has revealed that carers who have inadvertently earned more have been taken to court by the Department for Work and Pensions.

Carers UK and Just Retirement say that these rules make it hard for people to stay in paid work.

“Removing unnecessary pressures and ensuring those who can, and want to, remain in paid work is essential,” Walker says.

She says the low level of the payments doesn’t recognise what carers do, “and there are clear problems in the way that it’s delivered, making even small amounts of work challenging. Raising the earnings limit is something that would help more carers to stay in paid work and help avoid some devastating overpayments.”

Stephen Lowe from Just Retirement says carer’s allowance was never intended to be a “wage” or payment for caring services. “However, if the rules are stopping or limiting people from taking up employment and earnings opportunities that are available to them, then we have to question whether it is fit for purpose.”

He warns that if people restrict their work or give it up entirely to provide care, “that loss of income and other work benefits such as employer pension contributions is likely to have an impact on their lives for decades to come, as well as on the businesses who lose key staff.”

Among proposals in the party manifestos for next week’s general election are a pledge by the Lib Dems to increase carer’s allowance by £20 a week and to introduce a new earnings taper of £183, after which carers would start to lose some of their allowance. Labour has previously said it would review the system but included no details in its election pledges.

Walker says that without better support for working carers, the problems they face will show no sign of abating.

“The last decade has seen a significant rise in the number of hours of unpaid care being provided and a reduction in social care available,” she says. “Our recent YouGov research revealed that 62% of UK adults – the equivalent of 10 million current or former unpaid carers – said they have had no choice about taking on an unpaid caring role.”","Carers UK has been conducting an annual survey for several years, each time asking people about the impact of their role on their finances.

The Guardian,https://www.theguardian.com/money/article/2024/jun/29/council-tax-final-year-students-warned-they-could-get-surprise-bills,2024-06-29,06:00:46 UTC,Council tax: final-year students warned they could get surprise bills,"Final-year university students have been urged to check that they do not owe council tax for the last few weeks of their rented accommodation.

While students are exempt from the tax during the course, they are liable to pay as soon as they finish their final year.

The UK government says student status ends the day after the close of a university’s summer term, usually at the beginning of June.

Student accommodation leases from private landlords typically run until late June, July or even August, and this discrepancy means the risk of a surprise bill.

Megan Lloyd, a debt expert at Citizens Advice, says: “Students become liable for council tax from the day after they formally stop being a student. This could be when their course officially ends, or the day after they abandon it or get dismissed from their studies.

“For example, if a student’s final term ends on 10 June, they will become liable for council tax from 11 June,” she says.

She adds: “This only applies to final-year students; students don’t have to pay council tax during the summer holidays between years of study.”

Manchester city council has already sent out letters billing graduating students for days since term ended. Other councils are less proactive.

A spokesperson for Council Tax Advisors said: “It’s advisable for students to check with their local council for precise details, as there can be variations in how councils handle the end of term exemptions and the start of council tax liability.”

Council tax bills are based on a property’s value so how much students could become liable for depends on the property they are renting.

According to Gov.uk, from 2024 to 2025, the average bill for a band D property (priced between £68,001 and £88,000 in value on 1 April 1991) will be £2,171 a year. This is about £181 a month – a lot when a third of students live off less than £50.

Students who receive a letter or due payment notice should take action so it does not result in a debt.

There can be serious consequences for council tax arrears, including legal action or a visit from a bailiff.

Students who can prove they are no longer living in the property may be able to get an exemption at their council’s discretion.

However, for the most part, those in this position will need to pay.

It is important for students to continue checking post, especially as their housemates begin to move out of their rented accommodation.","Final-year university students have been urged to check that they do not owe council tax for the last few weeks of their rented accommodation.

The Guardian,https://www.theguardian.com/money/article/2024/jun/28/savers-urged-to-open-inflation-beating-accounts-before-uk-interest-rates-fall,2024-06-28,07:00:15 UTC,Savers urged to open inflation-beating accounts before UK interest rates fall,"UK savers are being urged to lock into an inflation-beating savings account before interest rates start their downward journey.

A number of fixed-rate savings bonds currently pay 5%-plus – on these accounts your return is guaranteed and you will be earning more than twice the current rate of inflation.

However, with most analysts expecting the first Bank of England base rate cut in August or September, followed by several more over the next year or two, the rates available right now may not hang around for long, some commenters claim.

Mark Hicks, a savings expert at investment firm Hargreaves Lansdown, says: “This is a window of opportunity for savers, so now is the time to clamber in and grab a decent rate before it closes.”

Lucinda O’Brien, of the comparison website money.co.uk, has a similar message: “Now is the time to act, before it’s too late.”

Earlier this month it was announced that inflation measured by the consumer prices index (CPI) fell to 2% in May. It’s a far cry from the period in 2022 and 2023 when inflation was running at 10% to 11%, eating into the value of millions of people’s nest-eggs.

Many of the highest-paying savings accounts offering a rate of 5%-plus are fixed-rate deals where you have to tie your money up for 12 months.

At the time of writing, a number of players were offering one-year fixed-rate savings bonds paying 5.2% or more. These include the My Community Bank credit union and Union Bank of India (UK), both paying 5.22%; Vanquis Bank, offering 5.21%; and Close Brothers Savings, paying 5.2%.

These require a minimum deposit of £1,000, except Close Brothers Savings, which requires £10,000 to open an account.

However, Sarah Coles, the head of personal finance at Hargreaves Lansdown, says that while you can earn the most interest with a one-year fixed-rate account, “you would need to track down another fix when it matured [and] there’s a decent chance the rates on offer by then will be significantly lower”.

This is why two-year fixed savings bonds are looking attractive, she says. “You could consider tying up any cash you don’t need for two years, and making the most of the great rates while they’re around.”

On Thursday, the highest-paying two-year fixed-rate savings bonds were those offered by Vanquis Bank and Close Brothers Savings, paying 5.06% on minimum balances of £1,000 and £10,000 respectively.

Other providers offering two-year fixed savings accounts boasting best-buy rates included Hodge Bank (4.97%), Market Harborough building society (4.95%), and Atom Bank (4.9%). The minimum deposits for these are £1,000, £10,000 and £50 respectively.

“This is a really sensible time to consider locking in a fixed rate,” says Coles. She believes the Bank of England is not going to be in a hurry to cut rates, but they are likely to get progressively lower. “By the middle of next year [rates] are forecast to be 4.5%, and by the middle of 2026 they are expected to hit 4%.”

It is a good idea to review your savings rates anyway, if you have not done so during the past six to 12 months, says Rachel Springall, of the financial data provider Moneyfacts.

Loyalty “does not always pay”, and the average easy-access account interest rate paid across the biggest high street banks is 2.01%, which is 0.05% less than it was six months ago, based on a snapshot of rates on 19 June.","UK savers are being urged to lock into an inflation-beating savings account before interest rates start their downward journey.

The Guardian,https://www.theguardian.com/money/article/2024/jun/27/private-car-parks-uk-motorists-10-minute-grace-period-fines,2024-06-27,12:30:03 UTC,Private car parks to give UK motorists 10-minute grace period before fines,"Private car parks will offer motorists in the UK a 10-minute “grace period” before issuing fines, but motorists say the voluntary code is not enough to protect drivers from unfair practices.

The measure is part of a new code of practice that private car-park companies have promised to introduce in the autumn. Industry trade bodies will also implement a fairer appeals system and maintain an existing cap on charges of £100 – reduced to £60 if paid within 14 days.

However, motoring organisations have argued that the proposed code falls far short of the standards required and are calling for government legislation.

The AA’s head of roads policy, Jack Cousens, said: “This self-authored code doesn’t acknowledge the need to cap charges and remove debt recovery fees … These elements are desperately needed from a government-backed code to protect innocent drivers from the sharks running private car parks.”

The code was published by the British Parking Association and the International Parking Community, the two trade bodies representing private car-park operators.

It also includes requirements for more consistent signage and an “appeals charter” for drivers. The grace period means that vehicles in car parks will have 10 minutes after parking expires before being issued with a fine.

Parking companies will only be required to meet the new standards in full by December 2026.

Politicians and motorist groups have criticised private parking businesses – which issued 9.7m tickets between April and December last year – for unreasonable fees and misleading signage.

A bill to enable the introduction of a legislation-backed code of conduct received royal assent in March 2019. The legislation, which was withdrawn in 2022 after a legal challenge from private parking companies, included halving the cap on tickets for most parking offences to £50, among a number of other measures.

Simon Williams, the head of policy at the RAC, said: “Drivers shouldn’t be fooled into thinking this so-called code developed by the private parking industry itself is the same as the long-delayed official private parking code of practice that is backed by legislation.

“This, and only this, will bring an end to the worst practices of some private parking operators, and mean drivers – especially those who are vulnerable – are protected from unreasonable fines and debt collectors chasing down payments.”","Private car parks will offer motorists in the UK a 10-minute “grace period” before issuing fines, but motorists say the voluntary code is not enough to protect drivers from unfair practices.

The Guardian,https://www.theguardian.com/money/article/2024/jun/27/car-insurer-learner-driver-policy-collingwood,2024-06-27,06:00:30 UTC,Car insurer charged £40 to cancel learner driver policy,"I wanted to draw your, and your readers’, attention to something I think is extremely sharp practice by the insurance broker Collingwood.

I bought its annual learner driver policy for my son last year for £256.

Collingwood was clear that once he passed his driving test the policy would cease to be valid, which I understood.

In fact, it took my son almost the whole year before he passed, with only a few weeks of the policy left to run.

I was content to let it expire, in the knowledge that no partial refund would be due.

I was then very surprised to receive an email informing me that, since my son had passed his test, I now owed Collingwood a £40 “cancellation fee”.

I knew, in practice, no claim could now be made on it. I had paid the full premium upfront and owed nothing further.

Collingwood’s position is that the charge is included in its Ts and Cs, which I ticked when I bought the policy, and so is legitimate.

I see from different review websites that many people have been affected by this and are complaining they feel ripped off. I appreciate that cancellation fees may be appropriate when the consumer no longer wants the product, but charging £40 to basically allow a policy to lapse does not seem at all reasonable.

ML, by email

I couldn’t agree more. The company is, in effect, selling a policy that it expects the vast majority of its buyers will have to cancel before the end of the term, and is failing to explicitly mention this charge upfront.

It is likely doing so to make the policy look cheaper than it actually is in web comparisons. In my view, it is a hidden charge – one, as you say, that is catching out a lot of people.

I asked Collingwood about it and it says it was still looking into your complaint, made more than a month ago.

“The fee and conditions of cancellation are clearly presented in the customer journey prior to purchase, and also require an acknowledgment that they have been understood and accepted, before any policy can be purchased,” it said.

“With reference to the amount of the fee charged, this has been set with consideration to fair value and the consumer duty.”

If everyone who finds themselves on the wrong end of this £40 charge takes the matter to the Financial Ombudsman, the company will soon put it upfront on its website, which is what it should do anyway. Other potential Collingwood policy buyers take note of this shoddy behaviour.

The Guardian,https://www.theguardian.com/money/article/2024/jun/26/make-it-mini-mga-toy-recall,2024-06-26,17:55:27 UTC,"Millions of Miniverse toys recalled over risks of skin, eye and respiratory issues","A large volume of toys – 21m sets of MGA Entertainment’s Miniverse Make It Mini sets – are being recalled across the US over risks of skin, eye and respiratory irritation.

In an announcement on Tuesday, the US Consumer Product Safety Commission said that the toy sets, which consist of spheres containing material required to assemble miniature imitations of appliance, food or lifestyle items, contain resin that, when liquid, can cause various physical issues.

The resin packaging in each set may imitate food items such as a peanut butter jar, maple syrup and a milk container and the resins when hardened imitate food, the CPSC said.

Each sphere consists of a disposable wrapper bearing the words “MGA’s Miniverse” on a yellow background and “Make It Appliances” or “Make It Mini Food” in bright pink, or “Make It Mini Lifestyle” in salmon pink. The wrapper contains information related to the manufacturer’s identity and country-specific information in different languages, CPSC added.

According to the CPSC, the resins contain acrylates, a chemical agent made from acrylic acid, in amounts prohibited in children’s products by the Federal Hazardous Substances Act. After the resins harden, they no longer pose a risk.

MGA Entertainment has received 26 reports of incidents with this product affecting children and adults. Those include reports of burns and irritation, respiratory irritation, as well as one report of a consumer’s asthma being triggered.

In addition to the toy sets being recalled across the US, there are 1m recalls that have been issued across Canada.

In a statement to CNN, the MGA Entertainment CEO, Isaac Larian, said that the product had been on the market for 18 months and that only 10% to 15% of the recalled products contain liquid resin.

From October 2022 through June 2024, the sets, which were manufactured in China and ranged in price from $7 to $13, were sold at Target, Walmart, Family Dollar, Dollar General, Aldi and Hobby Lobby, in addition to other stores and Amazon.com.

The Guardian,https://www.theguardian.com/business/article/2024/jun/30/unusual-economic-indicators,2024-06-30,11:00:20 UTC,What can lipstick and underwear sales tell us about the economy?,"Is the country heading towards a recession? Ask 10 economists and you’ll likely get 10 different answers. Which is why some people have given up on the traditional data – GDP, jobs, etc – and have instead recently been tinkering with more unusual economic indicators to help them guide their companies. Here are a few that I’ve seen.

Uniform patches

One known economic indicator is jobs and for that we tend to rely on unemployment numbers from the Bureau of Labor Statistics. But maybe there’s something better. Like the number of uniform patches sold each year. Uniform patches? Yes, those are the emblems that go on the uniforms worn by millions of workers, from fast food cashiers to drywall contractors. The financial data of one of the world’s largest makers of emblems and patches – privately held World Emblem – can’t be easily obtained. But the company’s owner recently told USA Today that sales are up 19% from the same period last year. A recession? “We’re not seeing it,” says Randy Carr, CEO of the Fort Lauderdale, Florida-based company. “It’s hard to believe there would be.”

Men’s underwear

Ask any guy about underwear, and they’ll usually admit the same thing. When times are good, we’re buying the good material. When money’s tight, we’re wearing those things until they literally fall off. So do men’s underwear sales mirror the economy overall? Some – including former Federal Reserve chief Alan Greenspan – think so. If you want to check out how the men’s underwear business is doing you can look at Hanesbrands or PVH Corp (which owns several leading brands, including Calvin Klein and Tommy Hilfiger) or Ralph Lauren Corporation. “Bottom” line: men’s underwear sales have been mostly flat over the past 12 months.

Lipstick

For the most part, lipstick is a relatively inexpensive accessory, with a typical tube costing anywhere from $5 to $20. History has shown that women will cut back on more expensive beauty goods like makeup and perfume when times are tight. But lipstick? Don’t even go there. When lipstick sales increase as luxury beauty item accessories decrease, that’s another potential sign of economic headwinds. Where to research lipstick sales? Try the big cosmetics companies like L’Oreal, Estee Lauder and Ulta Beauty. All three companies have shown strong revenue gains over the past year.

Overseas freight

World shipping has a significant impact on our economy and instead of tracking units and cargo activity, some economists instead track the price of freight. Why? Because in a supply and demand world, the greater the demand for shipping, the more freight should cost. To track this phenomena, look no further than the Baltic Dry Index. This is a well-watched measure of freight costs for shipping items across the Baltic Sea, one of the world’s busiest shipping lanes. So how are freight costs doing? They’re up more than 55% over the past year and even slightly higher than pre-Covid times.

Recreational vehicles

If you’ve never taken a trip in a recreational vehicle (RV), you’re missing out. It’s fun and a great way to explore our national parks. Some economists think that RV sales are an economic indicator because RVs – a luxury item - are not only expensive to buy, but they come with high maintenance costs and tend to calculate gas usage by gallons per mile. So how’s the RV industry doing? Judging by one of America’s largest makers of these vehicles – Winnebago – not so great. Sales have been declining for the past few years and the company’s stock price has fallen 35% in the past year.

I’m only scratching the surface on unusual economic indicators. Besides RVs you can follow the sales of champagne. Instead of men’s underwear you can also track women’s hemlines (which are believed to rise and fall along with the stock market). You can dig into the buttered popcorn index (which some say increases during times of recession as a small bit of a luxury in an otherwise cruel world). You can even keep track of hairstyles in Japan, where some say that women wear their hair longer when times are good and shorter when times are tough. Good luck finding this data, let alone making any sense of it.

Goofy economic metrics like these are fun to talk about with your friends and colleagues. But they shouldn’t be taken seriously. I run a business, and my go-to economic indicator is my clients. I’ve learned that the best way to insulate my business from the economy is to diversify: have as many clients in as many industries and geographic locations as possible. The US is a big country, and even when one client is cutting back on his underwear purchases in Illinois, I’ll likely have another buying uniform emblems in Texas. Focus on this instead of lipstick.","So do men’s underwear sales mirror the economy overall?

The Guardian,https://www.theguardian.com/business/article/2024/jun/30/if-workers-rights-are-a-bit-french-as-the-tories-suggest-then-vive-la-revolution,2024-06-30,06:00:14 UTC,"If workers’ rights are ‘a bit French’, as the Tories suggest, then vive la révolution | Heather Stewart","To the stirring strains of the Marseillaise, a monochrome Angela Rayner reels off her plans for workers’ rights, as a red beret and a Gallic moustache jiggle around her head. “Angela Rayner’s Britain?” demands the title, alongside a tiny tricolour.

Tory messaging has become ever more bizarre as this gaffe-strewn campaign lurches towards a close, but Thursday’s example, warning that Labour may make the UK’s labour market un peu French, hit new heights of weirdness.

For one thing, the mention of France seems more likely to evoke pleasant holidays than picket lines. More importantly, polling suggests the policies Rayner set out in the clip – employment rights from day one of a job, banning fire and rehire, binning bogus self-employment – are popular with the public.

Recent TUC polling found that two-thirds of people supported employees having the right to unfair dismissal from day one – including 61% of 2019 Tory voters. Similarly, two-thirds were in favour of a ban on fire and rehire.

Two things probably underlie the groundswell of opinion that tougher rules are needed in the labour market. One is the plain fact that too many people have found themselves working hard and still un­able to make ends meet. Real wage growth has been all but stagnant for the best part of 15 years, with average earnings a pathetic £16 a week higher than in 2010 – despite significant increases in the minimum wage (rebranded as the “national living wage”) under successive Conservative governments.

Against that backdrop, it is hardly surprising some feel the balance has tipped too far from workers to employers – a sentiment that perhaps also partly explains the ­support for public sector strikes last year.

It is more than that, however: there is a sense not just of a lack of bargaining power, but of unfairness, injustice even, in the way the labour market works for those trapped at the bottom.

From “self-employed” gig economy workers summarily laid off via an app to social care staff exploited by rogue employers and shift workers unable to plan childcare because of last-minute changes, there is an infuriating impotence about so many people’s interactions with the labour market. That is only likely to increase as new technologies are used to monitor and even manage workers as they go about their jobs.

In theory, Labour’s new deal for working people should help to turn the tide, particularly when combined with the tougher approach to enforcement Rayner has promised.

Social care is set to be the testing ground for a new approach of “fair pay agreements” under which employers and unions will have to hammer out terms and conditions that ministers will then apply across the sector.

Unions will be given the right to enter workplaces and make the case for membership – something the GMB has only just won at Amazon’s Coventry warehouse under strict conditions as part of a statutory ballot. And a new Labour government would consult about establishing a single employment status, abolishing the halfway house of “worker”, which comes with more obligations than rights.

As with so many areas of Labour’s agenda, however, the details will be critical – as will timing. Fair pay agreements were introduced in New Zealand in 2022, but implementation took so long that not a single one had come into force before the government changed and the plan was scrapped.

When, as seems likely, Rayner arrives at her desk as deputy prime minister on Friday, she will face intense pressure to water down the plans from business groups – and from some in her own party.

The Tory attack video ­echoed a line that originated with the CBI’s president, Rupert Soames, that Labour is poised to create a “European model” for the labour market. It is worth stressing how far away the UK is from that at present: Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development data suggests that 26% of workers here are covered by collective bargaining, for example, compared with 100% in Italy, 98% in France and 54% in Germany.

Regulation of the labour market has the potential to change millions of people’s lives for the better

But Soames’s concerns will find an echo among some in Labour. Furious unions confronted the party earlier this year over what they saw as an effort to undermine the new deal for workers – with union insiders claiming the shadow chancellor, Rachel Reeves, was keen to burnish her business credentials by being seen to push back against the plans. A fragile peace broke out after a face-to-face meeting between union general secretaries and shadow cabinet members, including Keir Starmer, but much about the fine details will only become clear the other side of the election.

The necessity to regain business backing has been a key part of Labour’s plan to win Thursday’s vote. If it succeeds, as polls suggest, the question facing the party on Friday will be a very different one: how to wield that power?

Regulation of the labour market is knotty, unglamorous and the subject of intense lobbying, but it has the potential to change millions of people’s lives for the better. Rayner should embrace the beret, face down the doubters and be bold.","Tory messaging has become ever more bizarre as this gaffe-strewn campaign lurches towards a close, but Thursday’s example, warning that Labour may make the UK’s labour market un peu French, hit new heights of weirdness.

The upward revision to Q1 GDP growth from 0.6% quarter-on-quarter to 0.7% q/q this morning (see opening post) suggests whoever is Prime Minister this time next week may benefit from the economic recovery being a bit stronger than expected.

So says Paul Dales, chief UK economist at Capital Economics.

He told clients that the economy may grow faster than expected this year – a boost to the winner of next Thursday’s general election.

The larger rise in GDP in Q1 was mainly due to upward revisions to consumer spending (from +0.2% q/q to +0.4% q/q) and the contribution from net trade (from +0.4ppts to +0.6ppts) more than offsetting downward revisions to government spending (from +0.3% q/q to 0.0% q/q) and residential investment (from +4.1% q/q to +3.2% q/q). The revision suggests that real GDP growth in 2024 as a whole may be more likely to come in a bit above our existing forecast of 1.0%.

Dales adds:

It now looks as though real household disposable income will grow by more than our forecast of 2.0% this year and we are expecting a solid 3.5% gain next year too. This underpins our forecast that consumer spending will be the main driver of a rise in GDP of at least 1.0% this year and about 1.5% next year. Should the saving rate fall back from its unusually high level, the economic recovery could be even stronger. This is certainly good news for whoever will be the Prime Minister this time next week, although it could also contribute to the Bank of England cutting interest rates a bit slower than otherwise.","So says Paul Dales, chief UK economist at Capital Economics.

Gross domestic product (GDP) rose by 0.7% in the first three months of 2024, revised upwards by the Office for National Statistics from a first estimate of 0.6%.

The first-quarter figures were lifted by growth in the services sector, up by 0.8%, as well as the production sector, which expanded by 0.6%, although that was revised down from 0.8% in the initial estimate. Other areas of the economy fared less well, with bad weather hampering the construction sector, where output fell by 0.6%.

The data confirmed that the UK was the fastest-growing economy in the G7 during the first quarter after a short recession in the second half of last year.

Real household disposable income – how much each home is left with after tax, adjusted for inflation – is estimated to have increased by 0.7% in the first quarter of this year, matching the growth in the final quarter of 2023, according to the ONS.

The strength of the economy has been a big issue in the general election campaign after voters suffered a squeeze from higher inflation and increased mortgage rates over the past three years.

Rishi Sunak has insisted that the UK economy has turned a corner but the latest encouraging data comes less than a week before polling day.

The Resolution Foundation thinktank said living standards – as measured by real household disposable income per head – were up by 2.4% as a result of pay rising faster than prices.

Despite the improvement as cost of living pressures have eased, living standards over the 2019-24 parliament as a whole fell by 0.6%, leaving the average person £120 a year worse off than they were at the time of the last election.

Adam Corlett, the thinktank’s principal economist, said it was only the third time since the first world war that living standards had been lower at the end of a parliament than at the start.

The UK economy showed no growth in April, with an increase in the services sector offset by falls in production and construction after heavy rain hampered building work and deterred shoppers from spending on the high street.

However, more recent figures show consumer confidence is returning – bolstered by falling inflation and stronger retail sales. UK inflation fell to 2% in May returning to the official target rate for the first time in nearly three years. Figures released last week showed retail sales bounced back with 2.9% growth in May after a weather-affected drop of 1.8% the previous month.

Economists said the improving economy was likely to benefit the incoming prime minister, with the Bank of England widely expected to cut interest rates later this year.

“It now looks as though real household disposable income will grow by more than our forecast of 2.0% this year and we are expecting a solid 3.5% gain next year too,” said Paul Dales, the chief UK economist at the research company Capital Economics.

“This is certainly good news for whoever will be the prime minister this time next week, although it could also contribute to the Bank of England cutting interest rates a bit slower than otherwise.”

Dales said the household savings ratio – the proportion of disposable income saved rather than spent – stood at 11.1% in the first quarter, its highest level since the second quarter of 2021.

Households tend to save more when they feel uncertain about the future, and the savings ratio rose during the cost of living crisis. Dales said that should the savings ratio come down from its “unusually high level” growth could be stronger than the 1% and 1.5% he was expecting for 2024 and 2025 respectively.","The UK economy grew at a faster rate than previously thought in the first quarter of 2024, handing the next prime minister an improved economic backdrop.

Unless the polls are wildly inaccurate, the Conservative party is heading towards a catastrophic defeat in the coming election.

All across the rich world, voters are angry at their governments – they blame politicians for a burst of inflation that happened almost everywhere and is now subsiding almost everywhere, including in the UK. But the Conservatives deserve defeat more than most: they took power 14 years ago promising to deliver responsible policies and economic success. Instead they have presided over economic stagnation and a collapse in public services.

Why has Conservative governance gone so badly? It is natural to blame Brexit, which did indeed increase trade frictions and therefore surely had a negative effect on British real income. However, Brexit has not had the disastrous effects some predicted, and has somewhat perversely led to a rise rather than a fall in immigration, especially of the highly skilled.

In fact, the roots of Britain’s poor economic performance are older and deeper than Brexit. Though many bad decisions undoubtedly contributed, one central cause was the way David Cameron and George Osborne gratuitously embraced fiscal austerity when they came to power after the global financial crisis.

At the time, this looked like an obvious macroeconomic error; more than a decade later, it has become a social and political catastrophe.

Let us recall the circumstances when the Conservatives took power. The financial crisis had produced a severe global recession; by 2010 the world economy was growing again, but all major economies, Britain included, were still operating far below capacity and had high unemployment.

Textbook economics tells us that when unemployment is high and inflation is low, governments should try to stimulate demand with reduced interest rates and fiscal deficits. Interest cuts were not an option because rates were already close to zero, so the indicated policy was fiscal stimulus.

Yet the Cameron government chose to do the opposite, pulling back fiscal support from an economy that still needed it badly. Britain was not the only nation turning to fiscal austerity in the face of high unemployment – Greece engaged in savage austerity, while Portugal, Spain, Italy and Ireland made large cuts, and fiscal policy in the US also turned contractionary.

What made the British case unique was that it was almost entirely an unforced error. Southern European austerity was a response to pressure from the bond markets: Greece was in effect cut off from private markets, while other nations faced sharply increased borrowing costs, becoming dependent on official lenders who insisted on budget cuts as a condition for loans. Bond buyers never lost faith in the US, but after 2010 Barack Obama faced a deeply hostile Congress, which in effect blackmailed him into spending cuts by threatening to provoke a government default.

While Britain had low borrowing costs like the US, its government was not divided. The Cameron executive could have chosen to maintain spending. Why did it turn to austerity?

Part of the answer is that policymakers were genuinely spooked by the sudden emergence of the crisis in Greece. Until Greece hit the wall, debt crises were generally thought of as a problem that happened only in poorer nations. It is understandable that many observers, at least initially, wondered if the Greek crisis was the leading edge of a broader attack by bond vigilantes.

But UK debt was clearly far smaller relative to the economy than Greece’s – and it became obvious early on that contagion from the Greek debt crisis was restricted to eurozone nations. So there was no reason to continue believing that the UK risked “becoming Greece”, as many politicians recklessly claimed at the time.

In fact, it soon became clear that even the eurozone crisis was more a matter of market panic than one of fundamentally unsustainable levels of debt. As the economist Paul De Grauwe has said, nations with debts in another country’s currency can suffer something similar to a bank run: panicked investors seeking to pull out their funds can cause a government to run out of cash, forcing it into default. Nations that borrow in their own currency are not vulnerable to such a self-fulfilling crisis, because they can in effect print money in a crunch.

This analysis was validated in 2012 when Mario Draghi, the president of the European Central Bank (ECB), said three words: “Whatever it takes.” This was taken to mean that the ECB would, if necessary, supply cash to governments facing a market panic. And suddenly the euro “debt” crisis faded away, with investors demanding much lower interest rates on the debt of Italy, Spain and so on.

Since Britain has not adopted the euro and had debts in its own currency, it was not vulnerable to this kind of cash crisis.

The bottom line is that there was no pressing economic need to slash spending in the face of high unemployment. I would argue that the best way to explain Britain’s austerity is not economic but sociological.

Sociology? I used to talk about the push for austerity being led by Very Serious People (a term I borrowed from the blogger Duncan Black). This was not really a joke: if you spend any time consorting with members of the global policy elite, you realise that many of them are driven primarily by the desire to appear “serious”. In economic terms, this usually means pushing policies that will cause significant hardship – to other people, of course.

The obsession with perceived seriousness reflects peer pressure, but in some ways also reflects personal careerism. Officials in democratic nations cannot expect to remain in office for more than a few years. What do they do next? If they have lobbied for “serious” policies, they can have a bright future giving speeches at Davos about the importance of making “tough choices”. Or they might even end up employed by the financial industry to lobby their former colleagues – where a reputation for “seriousness” is a prerequisite, no matter how much damage those policies have caused. (Indeed, Osborne has done both.)

Sociology partly explains the Conservative embrace of austerity. But there was also political calculation. Denunciations of debt and deficits often go hand in hand with demands for smaller government, in particular a shrunken welfare state. In effect, politicians whose real goal is to move policy to the right exploit fear of deficits to push an agenda that would be deeply unpopular if stated openly. The Oxford economist Simon Wren-Lewis calls this the “deficit deceit” hypothesis. The deceit aspect is especially obvious in the US, where Republican leaders routinely denounce deficits while pushing for budget-busting tax cuts. But there is every reason to believe that the same kind of cynicism played an important role in UK austerity.

It turns out, however, that exploiting debt fears to engineer cuts in public spending tends not to work out quite the way that small-government advocates hope.

What serious conservatives – they do exist – want is a less generous social safety net, with fewer income transfers to households, while governments concentrate on those functions that only government can perform. I do not share that desire, but never mind. What is important is that voters do not share that desire: cutting direct financial aid is deeply unpopular.

What does this have to do with deficit deceit? Even when a government manages to build support for spending cuts by scaring the public about debt and deficits, it generally finds itself shying away from spending cuts that will directly affect families’ incomes. Instead, it tries to save money by shortchanging public investment and public services, a strategy that seems preferable because the consequences of these spending cuts may not be all that visible in the short run.

But the effects of inadequate public investment cumulate over time, so that a fiscal strategy advertised as an exercise in responsibility ends up being deeply irresponsible, leading to crumbling infrastructure and deteriorating public services. This is how Cameron and Osborne’s error has compounded over the past decade.

Consider the NHS. I am clearly not an expert on the system, and I am sure that the NHS’s problems have multiple causes. But it is obvious to an outsider that direct public provision of healthcare, while it has major advantages, creates a special form of political vulnerability.

Compare the NHS with single-payer systems – including Medicare, which serves older Americans – in which the government pays the bills but does not employ the doctors or operate the hospitals. An attempt to save money by underfunding Medicare would provoke an immediate public outcry – in fact, false rumours of such a move created an outcry in 2010. But a government can underfund the NHS for years before the consequences become obvious to voters, and by that time the crisis can be very hard to fix.

To sum up: a decade ago, the main critique of austerity was macroeconomic – it was holding back recovery from the severe recession that followed the global financial crisis. And it did. But that was not the end of the story. Austerity also gradually undermined public services, including healthcare.

What will a Labour government do to reverse this damage? There are two reasons to worry it will fall short.

First, the era of Conservative austerity coincided with an era of low interest rates and substantial excess capacity, exactly the conditions under which Britain should have been investing in its future. The current environment is much less favourable.

Second, Labour’s stated plans lack any ambition to reverse austerity. In the US, the Biden administration came in with bold plans and managed to accomplish a significant fraction of them despite having only a razor-thin congressional majority. I am not hearing anything comparable from Labour, even though Keir Starmer seems on course to have political capital beyond the wildest dreams of US progressives.

I hope to be proved wrong. But right now it looks as though the shadow of austerity policies adopted in error 14 years ago will continue to darken Britain’s prospects for many years to come.","Though many bad decisions undoubtedly contributed, one central cause was the way David Cameron and George Osborne gratuitously embraced fiscal austerity when they came to power after the global financial crisis.

The Guardian,https://www.theguardian.com/politics/article/2024/jun/27/labour-europe-eu-brexit-jonathan-reynolds,2024-06-27,16:47:34 UTC,Labour to seek ‘stable position’ with Europe rather than reopen Brexit debate,"Labour would rather have stability in the UK’s relationship with Europe than try to seek accelerated economic growth by rejoining the EU’s single market or customs union, the shadow business secretary has said.

Addressing the British Chambers of Commerce (BCC) conference on Thursday, Jonathan Reynolds acknowledged that Brexit had been “very difficult for businesses” because it had erected trade barriers, but said reopening the debate would be worse.

With less than a week to go until polls open in the general election, Reynolds was trying to woo business leaders at the London event with a pitch that emphasised policy stability and encouraged businesses to invest.

Some business leaders and economists have said Labour’s hopes to grow the economy – and thereby pay for improved public services – could flounder without improved access to EU trade. But Reynolds argued that returning to the tumultuous debate over Brexit would be economically harmful because businesses would hold back investments further.

“You could not relive the argument and provide people with the assurance they need that we are moving to a period where British politics is going to be in a stable position rather than frankly causing you more difficulties,” he said.

“The practical, trade-based agreements that we put forward, rather than the constitutional arguments around customs unions or single markets, are a genuinely better way to do that.”

Kemi Badenoch, Reynolds’s Conservative counterpart, appeared later at the same event. She portrayed a Labour government as a threat to the sector and said her party believed in the “power of business to do good”.

However, the business secretary focused much of her appearance on “my favourite topic, of course, the divisive topic of identity politics”.

Badenoch compared Labour plans to monitor ethnic pay disparities to apartheid South Africa, saying she thought that the policy – an idea previously proposed by the Tory prime minister Theresa May – was “morally repellent” and claimed Labour wanted ethnicity to influence pay.

Labour’s manifesto does not say ethnicity should influence pay. The party has pledged to “enshrine in law the full right to equal pay for Black, Asian and other ethnic minority people” as well as make larger companies report the gap between pay for disabled and ethnic minority employees and the broader workforce. The Conservative party introduced similar gender pay gap reporting in 2017.

Shevaun Haviland, the BCC’s director general, told the conference that the political parties must stop “walking on eggshells” and try to improve the UK’s relationship with Europe, notably on aligning food and drink regulations, VAT and mutual recognition of professional qualifications. However, she added that Reynolds was right that “businesses don’t want a renegotiation”.

Amanda Blanc, the chief executive of the FTSE 100 insurer Aviva, told the conference that “an air of weariness and cynicism hangs over our economy” and that some of the “doom and gloom” was justified. However, she said she was optimistic that stable public policy after the election would allow businesses to invest in growing the economy.

Labour’s emollient message to business contrasts with 2019, when it lost the last election under the leadership of Jeremy Corbyn. Reynolds said the party’s relationship with business was “one of the most visible ways that Labour has changed since 2019”.

He was challenged at the conference by the owners of one business who said they were concerned about Labour’s pledge to give workers stronger rights, such as statutory sick pay and parental leave, from their first day of employment rather than after two years.

Fintan and Alison Galvin, a couple who serve as the chief executive and chief people officer of the Surrey-based software company Inv Group, said they were concerned that the changes would make it riskier for them to hire and train new workers.

“It seems very anti-business,” Alison Galvin said. “All of a sudden to have this potential curveball … You’ve got your probation period, but then after that what does that all look like?”

Fintan Galvin said: “To grow a business you’ve got to take risks. Anything that enhances a risk profile of employing a person is bad.”

Reynolds said he did not believe that Labour’s changes would affect the company’s recruitment practices, and he invited them to meet him to discuss their concerns.

During the election campaign Labour has also avoided making surprise policy announcements, mostly sticking with longstanding policy. Reynolds defended the party against accusations of running a boring campaign.

“I’m told by some commentators they don’t think Labour’s campaign is exciting enough,” he said. “Look, my friends, we’re not pitching you a new Netflix series, you know, we’re not putting on politics as entertainment.”","But Reynolds argued that returning to the tumultuous debate over Brexit would be economically harmful because businesses would hold back investments further.

Newsflash: The Bank of England has warned that financial markets remain at risk of a sharp correction.

In its latest financial stability report, the BoE says that high inflation, or geopolitical risks, could trigger a selloff.

The Bank says risks to the UK financial system are “broadly unchanged” since the first quarter of the year.

But some asset prices have continued to rise, it points out, while the risk of a sharp correction persists.

European markets are up around 8% so far this year, while the US Nasdaq Composite index has surged by 18%.

The report, which is designed to track the stability of the financial system, says:

The prices of many assets such as shares and bonds remain high relative to historical norms, and some have continued to rise. This suggests that investors in financial markets are continuing to expect the economy to recover and inflation to fall. They are placing less weight on risks, such as geopolitical developments or continued high inflation, that might cause weaker growth or interest rates to stay higher than expected. These risks make it more likely that there could be a sharp correction in asset prices that could ultimately make it more costly and difficult for UK households and businesses to borrow.

The Guardian,https://www.theguardian.com/business/article/2024/jun/27/global-elections-uk-economy-bank-of-england,2024-06-27,11:33:58 UTC,"Global wave of elections could hit UK financial system, warns Bank of England","Uncertainty caused by a global wave of elections, starting this weekend in France, risks destabilising the UK’s financial system, the Bank of England has warned.

Officials are concerned about the kind of policies that newly elected governments may enforce in large economies, including the US, where Donald Trump is vying for another term as president in the run-up to the election in November.

The French president Emmanuel Macron’s shock announcement of a parliamentary election, with a first round of voting on 30 June and Marine Le Pen’s far-right National Rally party forecast to make significant gains, had shown how political uncertainty could impact economic growth forecasts and cause volatility in financial markets, affecting government debt prices, the Bank’s financial policy committee (FPC) said.

But it is the sheer number of elections taking place this year that was cause for concern, with more than 80 countries – more than half the world’s population –heading to the polls this year. That includes the UK, where citizens will vote in a general election on 4 July.

“Policy uncertainty associated with upcoming elections globally has increased,” the Bank’s financial stability report said. Questions over a country’s political direction could amplify geopolitical risks, increase government borrowing costs, and lead to further global fragmentation, in a way that was “relevant to UK financial stability”, it said.

The FPC said it was still monitoring the impact high interest rates were having on households and businesses in the UK, with the Bank’s monetary policy committee having held rates at 5.25% this month for the seventh consecutive time.

That includes the 400,000 households whose monthly mortgage payments are expected to soar by 50% as they roll off fixed rates between now and the end of 2026.

In total, about 3 million – or 35% – of mortgageholders are still on fixed rates of below 3% and are due to see their payments jump over the next two years.

However, if headline interest rates drop from August onwards, as markets predict, another 2 million mortgageholders – including those on variable rates or coming off mortgages set at a higher level – could benefit, offsetting refinancing pressure for some households.

There are also concerns about the financial system’s exposures to the $8tn private-equity industry, which boomed during a period of low interests rates and has grown to play a significant role in financing UK businesses.

“Although the sector has been resilient so far, it is facing challenges in the higher rate environment,” the FPC said, noting this was becoming apparent as firms were forced to refinance their debt at much higher prices.

The FPC said it had also found “gaps” in the way UK banks were managing their exposure to the private-equity industry. The Bank of England and Financial Conduct Authority said they were working together to address a lack of transparency in overall borrowing levels, as well as the valuation of private-equity firms and their investments.

Policymakers said they would continue to test the resilience of the UK’s banking sector, revealing they would be testing the industry against the possibility of two separate and “severe” economic shocks.

The first – a “supply-shock scenario” echoing the ripple effects of Russia’s invasion of Ukraine – would cause inflation and interest rates to soar to 12% and 9%, respectively, as geopolitical tensions disrupt supply chains and cause the price of global commodities to soar.

The second “demand-shock scenario” – which has similarities to the impact of Covid-era lockdowns – assumes demand for global goods and services in decline, sending inflation and interest rates below 0.5% for a prolonged period of time.

In both cases, unemployment is projected to peak at 8.5% and the property industry would take a big hit, with commercial real estate prices declining by nearly 50%.

This year’s so-called desk-based stress tests are the second to be conducted without input from individual banks since they were launched a decade ago in response to the 2008 financial crisis.

The Guardian,https://www.theguardian.com/business/article/2024/jun/27/labours-growth-strategy-the-devil-lies-not-in-planning-but-in-implementation,2024-06-27,07:34:41 UTC,"Labour’s growth strategy: the devil lies not in planning, but in implementation","As in many other developed countries lately, the two major political parties in the UK have embraced economic growth as their top policy priority. After the volatile 49-day experience of Liz Truss’s government and its “dash for growth” in 2022, however, both parties emphasise that there are no financial shortcuts. The focus, instead, is on devising measures to boost productivity, resource allocation, and growth over the long term. In this respect, the opposition Labour party is ahead of the ruling Conservatives, though both are still working out the details of actual implementation.

Buoyant, durable, sustainable and inclusive growth is essential for a country where the older generations risk seeing their children end up worse off than they are. That has not happened in many decades. Only growth can deliver the resources needed to enhance living standards, improve public services, support sustainable energy initiatives, limit the scale of generalised tax increases, and combat inequality of wealth, income and opportunity.

In short, it is all about increasing the safe speed limit for economic growth. The Bank of England estimates the UK economy’s potential growth may be as low as 1%. At that speed, much that ails the country is likely to get worse, rather than better, over time. Moreover, this already weak growth potential could deteriorate even further if the problem is left to fester.

There is no singular, silver-bullet initiative that can change this outlook. Many British politicians are still haunted by the Truss saga, when the newly arrived prime minister tried to use unfunded tax cuts as a stimulus, only to create a damaging episode of financial instability. It is now widely acknowledged that after so many years of insufficient investment and sagging productivity, achieving high-quality growth requires a comprehensive policy approach that builds on many intermediate objectives.

The Labour party has gone further in specifying such structural reforms. Its programme includes proposals to revamp the planning system, boost infrastructure, improve trade links, crowd in domestic and foreign private investment (including through an energised National Wealth Fund), remove tax distortions, and pursue sector-specific initiatives. The party has also identified promising public-private partnerships geared toward enhancing investible funds, while encouraging innovation and efficiency.

Labour has indicated it would try to “hardwire” many of these reforms by strengthening existing institutions. To ensure all its policies remain compatible with financial stability, it has committed to adhere to the same public-debt “rule” as the current Conservative party.

The challenge now is to devise a detailed execution plan, one that includes a high-frequency monitoring system to provide real-time feedback and allow for timely course corrections, if needed. Any economic policy roadmap must favour comprehensive over piecemeal reforms. Such reforms should be implemented simultaneously, rather than sequentially, and they should come sooner rather than later.

As Labour demonstrated with its successful takeoff after coming to power in 1997, a new growth emphasis would benefit from serious credibility-enhancing steps. That is what then-chancellor of the exchequer Gordon Brown did with his surprising and insightful decision to hand over the reins of interest rate policy to the Bank of England, thus enshrining the principle of central bank independence.

One must hope that the current Labour leadership has not ruled out too much policy flexibility in its pursuit of a decisive election victory. Some of the most powerful measures that it is proposing would require resources upfront, but their growth and financial benefits would materialise only over time. The next government will also find itself confronting a more complicated, increasingly fragmented international system, and it will need to secure consistent buy-in from the private sector, which ultimately must do most of the heavy lifting.

Another, related task is to improve the functioning of existing growth engines while also supporting the development of the sectors and industries that will drive growth in the future. Striking a proper balance may prove to be the most difficult part of the challenge, given the country’s resource constraints and the fact that some key initiatives are better pursued at a regional level. (With its lack of sufficient robust regional initiatives to drive innovation in artificial intelligence, life sciences, and sustainable energy, the European Union faces a similar problem.)

Promoting high, durable, sustainable and inclusive growth was never going to be easy after so many years of neglect. The need to revamp the UK’s existing growth engines and simultaneously kickstart new ones makes the task even more complicated. But to paraphrase the US president John F Kennedy’s famous moonshot speech, the winning party must do these and “other things, not because they are easy, but because they are hard”.

The Guardian,https://www.theguardian.com/politics/article/2024/jun/26/uk-post-brexit-deal-bcc-eu,2024-06-26,21:30:20 UTC,"UK must stop ‘walking on eggshells’ over post-Brexit deal, says BCC chief","The UK’s current trade deal with the EU is not working and the country must stop “walking on eggshells” around the issue of building closer ties with its biggest trading partner, the director general of the British Chambers of Commerce (BCC) is expected to say.

At the annual BCC global conference in London on Thursday, Shevaun Haviland will say that the UK must forge closer ties with the EU and the next government should focus on improving trading relations to grow the economy.

“We must stop walking on eggshells and start saying it how it is,” Haviland will say.

“The current plan isn’t working for our members. But better trade terms are possible if the UK government and the EU reach agreement in areas of mutual benefit for business on both sides. A better deal is best for everyone.”

The intervention comes amid an election campaign where the two main political parties have largely stayed clear of the Brexit debate. Labour and the Conservatives have been criticised for their reluctance to discuss how successful Brexit has been and future policies towards the EU.

In an interview earlier this month, Keir Starmer had to deny that he was scared of talking about the issue, instead saying he was determined to build a “closer, better” relationship with the EU and improve Boris Johnson’s “botched deal”.

Businesses have criticised the additional red tape and increased costs that Brexit has heaped on to firms importing and exporting goods to and from the continent.

Importers of food and plants have been hit by charges associated with new Brexit border checks brought in at the end of April, with some logistics companies saying the changes have added up to 60% to transport costs.

Other businesses have complained that the increasing divergence on standards, such as those around construction products, has made it more expensive for UK companies to get their products certified for sale on the continent.

The comments from Haviland come as the BCC makes improving relations with the EU one of its key requests for the next government, saying the step would reduce costs for businesses.

The trade body is made up of 53 regional chambers of commerce affiliated to a central body and says it represents 50,000 businesses in the UK, which collectively employ six million people.

Its requests cover several specific policies, including securing a supplementary deal with the EU to remove the complexity of exporting food for small and medium-sized enterprises, and ensuring there are no new trade barriers created by linking the UK and EU emissions trading schemes.

It is also lobbying for a new deal that would allow UK companies to travel and work in Europe for longer.

The Labour party has said it will not return to the single market, the customs union or freedom of movement, but wants to deepen ties with Europe.

This includes negotiating a veterinary agreement to prevent border checks, help touring artists secure visas, while also promising to an agreement on professional qualifications to help open up markets for UK service exporters.

The Conservative manifesto says that the party would aim to build on the UK’s trade and cooperation agreement with the EU, but would not agree to anything that would “infringe the country’s sovereignty or involve submission to the court of justice of the European Union”.

It also said it wanted to further the benefits of Brexit by signing more trade deals, speeding up infrastructure developments, cutting red tape for business and creating new fishing opportunities.

Haviland will also use her speech to call for a long-term economic growth plan with a vision of up to 20 yearsand warn that action is needed to fix the UK’s growing skills shortages.","The UK’s current trade deal with the EU is not working and the country must stop “walking on eggshells” around the issue of building closer ties with its biggest trading partner, the director general of the British Chambers of Commerce (BCC) is expected to say.

Volkswagen will initially invest $1bn as part of a partnership with Rivian to form a new, equally controlled joint venture to share electric vehicle architecture and software, the companies said on Tuesday. The deal is a significant win for Rivian, which is grappling with steep losses as it attempts to ramp up production of its electric trucks and sport utility vehicles. While EV startups have been dealing with a slowdown in demand amid high interest rates and dwindling cash, traditional automakers have struggled to build battery-powered vehicles and advanced software. Shares in Rivian’s stock have jumped by 30% in early New York trading, from $11.96 to $15.47, following yesterday’s announcement.

5d ago 15.08 CEST Looking at the European economy, S&P Global says activity in the eurozone is on the rise, with the May composite purchasing managers’ indices firmly above the expansion threshold. Today’s report says: The eurozone has exited the recent manufacturing recession, putting it cyclically ahead of the U.S. Meanwhile, the labor market continues to slow although the unemployment rate remains near all-time lows. Southern Europe (Spain and Italy) continues to outperform Northern Europe (Germany) not only due to a prevalence of services, but also a rise in productivity in the case of Spain. Recent slower growth at the eurozone level reflects in part a faster passthrough of monetary policy, which has led to weaker inflation pressures. Share

5d ago 14.56 CEST S&P Global have raised their forecast for the UK economy this year. They now expect UK GDP to rise by 0.6% this year, up from a previous forecast of 0.3%. Chief economist Paul Gruenwald says “the recovery in services in the first quarter has been stronger than expected” in the UK. However, the UK growth forecast in 2025 has been trimmed to 1.2%, from 1.4%. Spain’s growth forecast has also been revised up, to 2.2% in 2024 from 1.8%. This is to reflect “robust household balance sheets and rapid disinflation”, Gruenwald explains. Share

5d ago 14.35 CEST S&P Global: soft-landing narrative remains valid The global economy remain on track for a soft landing, as central banks start to lower interest rates followin recent falls in inflation. So says credit rating agency S&P Global, in its latest global economic update. S&P Global is still optimistic that policymakers will pull off a ‘soft landing’ – bringing down inflation without triggering a recession. It explains: GDP growth has moderated in most economies (the U.S. remains an outlier) and recessions have been avoided. Demand pressures have come down, bringing inflation back toward target. Services demand and employment remain robust, moderating the speed of decline, and bolstering the probability of a soft landing. S&P Global argues that central banks have reached “the beginning of the end-game”, as some – such as the Bank of Canada, the Swiss National Bank and the European Central Bank – have recently started cutting interest rates in response to falling inflation. Although inflation has been stickier than hoped, S&P Global argues this is “just the flipside” of resilient spending and strong jobs markets, and compatible with a soft landing. They say: A recession with a sharp drop in employment and labor demand would likely produce a faster decline in inflation, but is that what we really want? Share

5d ago 14.32 CEST Dominic Chappell must repay £50m over BHS collapse Back in the UK retail sector, the former head of BHS is digesting a court ruling that he must pay at least £50m to cover losses racked up before its collapse. Yeterday, a judge found that Dominic Chappell had sought to “plunder” the UK department store chain, which collapsed in 2016. Mr Justice Leech said Chappell had agreed to purchase BHS without “any prospect” of obtaining working capital to meet its day-to-day financial needs. He then took the “opportunity to plunder the BHS Group as and when he could”, the judge explained. The Financial Times has more details: At a hearing on Tuesday, the judge said Chappell “should make the payments” set out in a draft order. A copy of the order, seen by the Financial Times, shows the sums include £21.5m for a wrongful trading claim, £17.5m for breach of fiduciary duty, plus costs and interest, totalling at least £50m. Back in 2020, Chappell was been sentenced to six years in jail for evading tax on the £2.2m income he received from his doomed takeover of BHS.

5d ago 13.53 CEST Bloomberg points out that Glencore’s coal business has long been a source of controversy among climate activists and some investors. In an article about LGIM’s divestment plans, they explain: In 2020, Norway’s sovereign wealth fund said it had sold its Glencore stake due to the company’s exposure to thermal coal. Glencore plans to consult with shareholders on the future of the coal business once it completes the acquisition of Teck Resources Ltd.’s steelmaking coal unit.

5d ago 12.05 CEST CBI: UK retail sales go into reverse Just in: UK retail sales have fallen faster than expected this month, as the sector went into reverse after May’s modest recovery. The CBI’s latest healthcheck on UK retailers, just released, found that retail sales volumes fell in the year to June, following a modest recovery in May. The CBI’s retail sales volume gauge fell to -24% this month, from +8% in May, showing that a majority of retailers reported a drop in volumes compared to the previous year.

Sales were reported to be below “average” for the time of year. Sales volumes are expected to remain below seasonal norms in July, albeit to a lesser extent. #DTS pic.twitter.com/RhJ7ohmOgj — CBI Economics (@CBI_Economics) June 26, 2024 The CBI explains: Sales were reported to be well below “average” for the time of year (-39% from +2% in May). Sales volumes are expected to remain below seasonal norms in July, albeit to a lesser extent (-29%).

Orders placed upon suppliers fell moderately in the year to June at a broadly similar pace to last month (-14% from -11% in May). Retailers expect the cutback in orders to continue next month (-16%). Alpesh Paleja, CBI interim deputy chief economist, says: “Last month’s nascent recovery in sales proved to be short-lived, with retailers reporting a faster-than-anticipated decline this month. Unseasonably cold weather in June may have played a role, but it’s notable that internet retail sales fell sharply in our survey, too. Consumer fundamentals are improving, with inflation now at the Bank of England’s 2% target and real incomes rising. But it’s clear that households are still struggling with the legacies of the cost-of-living crisis, with the level of prices still historically high in some areas. With consumer demand still on shaky ground, an incoming government can help business by ensuring that the UK is the most attractive place to start, grow and run a business. This will require bold action such as delivering a holistic cross-economy solution to the UK’s overly complex business rates system, which is a particular burden for retailers. This would help to alleviate the burden of higher costs.” Share

5d ago 11.34 CEST LGIM will also divest from TJX Legal & General Investment Management has also decided to divest its stake in US retail chain TJX, the parent company of UK chain TK Maxx. LGIM says TJX, like Glencore, failed to sufficiently address concerns raised in recent years about its environmental impact. LGIM says it concerned over TJX’s lack of a zero-deforestation policy and insufficient disclosure of “material Scope 3 emissions” that fail to account for its material value chains’ emissions. Today’s decisions will raise the number of divestments through LGIM’s Climate Impact Pledge to 16. LGIM says this “stewardship” of its investments is a critical lever in the global push to reach net zero. Stephen Beer, senior manager sustainability and responsible investment at Legal & General Investment Management, adds: We find that as time progresses, our conversations with companies can become harder-edged; not necessarily more difficult, but more focused. We use tools such as voting and divestment to encourage companies to meet our expectations on net-zero, while also sending a clear signal to the wider market. While divestment is one of the many stewardship tools we use as a mechanism for driving change, we see it as a last resort and by no means the last stage of engagement. Our engagement will continue, and where companies make sufficient progress, they will be reinstated. Ultimately, whilst we are focused on a net-zero objective, there is no one size fits all approach; our engagement approach is nuanced, it is about listening to companies and understanding the challenges they face, as well as the potential opportunities ahead, in accelerating the pace of the transition at a global scale.” Share","Share5d ago 14.56 CEST S&P Global have raised their forecast for the UK economy this year.

The Guardian,https://www.theguardian.com/business/article/2024/jun/26/universal-theme-park-bedfordshire-harry-potter-shrek-mario-kart,2024-06-26,13:29:33 UTC,Planned Universal theme park in Bedfordshire to ‘bring £50bn to UK economy’,"The movies group Universal has said a Hollywood theme park it plans to build in Bedfordshire, England, will be open 365 days a year and will boost the UK economy by nearly £50bn.

Universal Destinations & Experiences, which is owned by the US telecoms group Comcast, the parent company of Sky, plans to build on a 192-hectare site (476 acres) in Kempston Hardwick near Bedford. The company has an option to buy a further 25 hectares.

The theme park is expected to attract millions of visitors a year and would include a 500-room hotel and a dining area open to those without a theme park ticket.

The park’s experiences would include rides, shows and areas “based on the most popular films, video games and stories that people have enjoyed for decades”. Universal’s existing theme parks around the world feature Nintendo, Harry Potter and Shrek.

Construction is forecast to create 20,000 jobs and once open create 8,000 jobs initially, with more jobs likely over time, according to Universal. The company has pledged to pay the living wage to employees.

An analysis by Universal, produced in line with Treasury guidelines on economic appraisal, estimates the resort would bring in nearly £50bn of economic benefits to the UK.

The net economic contribution is forecast to be £35.1bn during construction and the first 20 years of operation. It would generate up to £14.1bn in additional tax returns over the same period, the study said.

Universal is still conducting due diligence and expects to decide on the project by the end of the year.

The new park, which would take five to six years to build, would be constructed on the site of Kempston Hardwick brickworks, once the world’s largest brickworks, which shut in 2008 and was demolished in September 2021.

The company said 92% of 6,000 people surveyed during a four-week public engagement period in May supported the theme park. It said it had “been delighted by the enthusiasm and overwhelmingly positive responses provided throughout the public engagement period”.

Page Thompson, Universal’s president in charge of new ventures, said: “A world-class theme park and resort from Universal has the potential to generate billions in economic benefit for the UK, by creating thousands of high-quality jobs and attracting millions of new visitors to the country.”

He told Sky News: “We’ve spent the last decade looking all over Europe and the United Kingdom for locations, and we think this is the best location we’ve ever seen.”

At the moment, Universal has five theme parks around the world: US parks in Hollywood, California, and at Orlando in Florida; as well as sites in Japan, China and Singapore.

The Guardian,https://www.theguardian.com/environment/article/2024/jun/26/air-freight-greenhouse-gas-emissions-increase-post-pandemic-economy,2024-06-26,12:00:16 UTC,"Air freight greenhouse gas emissions up 25% since 2019, analysis finds","Air freight operators have increased their greenhouse gas emissions by 25% compared with 2019, analysis has found.

In 2023, air freight operators ran about 300,000 more flights than in 2019, an increase in flight volume of almost 30%. The US accounted for more than 40% of global air freight emissions, according to the report by campaign group Stand.earth.

Dr Devyani Singh, one of the authors of the analysis, described the expansion as “a new climate and human health threat” and urged air freight companies to “end their reliance on air cargo and shift freight shipments to lower-carbon modes of transport such as marine shipping or rail”.

Air freight produces an estimated 80 times more carbon than shipping by sea or truck, making it one of the most carbon-intensive transportation methods.

The researchers attribute the sharp increase to shifts in the post-pandemic economy and newfound consumer expectations in e-commerce, where rapid shipping has become the standard; Amazon’s Prime membership programme is used by more than 200 million people globally.

The researchers said that before the Covid-19 pandemic, air freight was reserved mostly for perishable goods, time-sensitive deliveries and luxury items. However, disruptions in the pandemic-era supply chain led to an unprecedented rise in the number of non-perishable and lower-value goods transported by air freight.

The report highlights a twofold reason for increased emissions. Before the pandemic, cargo was often transported in the belly of passenger planes. The dip in consumer demand for international air travel during the pandemic led to an expansion of cargo-only fleets to transport wares. This has not subsequently fallen, even as belly cargo emissions have returned post-pandemic.

By 2023, air freight emissions had increased by 25% from 2019, making up 93.8m tonnes overall. Meanwhile, belly cargo emissions have bounced back to almost 90% of 2019 levels.

FedEx and UPS were responsible for 24.7% of the industry’s carbon emissions in 2023. It is estimated that 99.8% of aviation fuel is produced from fossil fuels, with the scaling of low carbon replacements a distant prospect.

The Guardian,https://www.theguardian.com/business/article/2024/jun/26/it-doesnt-make-sense-why-us-tariffs-on-chinese-cleantech-risk-the-green-transition,2024-06-26,04:00:06 UTC,It doesn’t make sense: why US tariffs on Chinese cleantech risk the green transition | Jeffrey Frankel,"With historic heatwaves sweeping across the US and other parts of the northern hemisphere, June is expected to be the 13th consecutive month of record-breaking global temperatures. The primary cause, of course, is the enormous amount of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere. Despite the existential threat posed by rising atmospheric concentrations of greenhouse gases, emissions continue to increase at a faster pace than previously anticipated.

On one front, however, progress in the fight against the climate crisis has exceeded expectations. Amid the global shift from internal combustion engines to electric vehicles and the accelerated adoption of solar and wind power, demand for renewable energy is rapidly rising in the US and the EU.

This increased demand has been fuelled by significant declines in the real prices of solar panels, wind turbines, batteries, and EVs. In the US, this can be attributed in part to the clean-energy subsidies included in President Joe Biden’s Inflation Reduction Act and, more significantly, to low-cost Chinese imports.

Alarmingly, new tariffs imposed by the US and the EU on imports of solar panels, EVs, and other equipment, threaten to derail this progress. While estimating the cost of the clean energy transition is a difficult task, even conceptually, the global electricity sector alone is projected to require $3.5tn in capital investment annually between 2021 and 2050. Western countries have demanded that China pay its fair share of these costs, but their own trade policies are starkly at odds with their objectives.

Although the disproportionate targeting of cleantech imports from China dates back more than a decade, the trend accelerated significantly under former US president Donald Trump and has continued under Biden. In May, the Biden administration imposed a 100% tariff on Chinese EVs, along with new levies on a range of other Chinese goods, including solar cells and lithium-ion batteries.

These measures aim to protect American workers and critical domestic industries. But they risk undermining the administration’s climate agenda, particularly its efforts to raise the share of renewables to 100% of US electricity by 2035 and the share of EVs to 50% of new car sales by 2030.

The new US tariffs could extend beyond China’s national borders. In response to western tariffs, some Chinese manufacturers have moved to south-east Asia in recent years. Earlier this month, the US International Trade Commission decided to investigate claims by American solar-cell companies seeking to impose countervailing and anti-dumping duties on south-east Asian manufacturers. This decision comes despite opposition from US solar-power developers who rely on imported equipment for domestic production.

Meanwhile, the European Commission has imposed provisional tariffs on Chinese EVs after an eight-month investigation found that China’s “unfair subsidisation” of its EV industry undercuts EU competitors. The new EU tariffs, while not prohibitive, average 31%, which is substantially higher than the duties on conventional car imports from other trading partners.

To be sure, while historically low labour costs and economies of scale have helped reduce the price of Chinese solar panels and EVs, generous government subsidies – often in the form of cheap credit – have also played a significant role. But it remains unclear how blocking these low-cost imports, as many western politicians propose, would benefit workers and consumers in the US and the EU. Do American and European policymakers prefer that their own taxpayers, instead of Chinese citizens, bear the costs of clean-energy subsidies? Recall that western countries wanted China to pay its fair share of the energy transition.

Admittedly, promoting climate policies by emphasising their potential to create green jobs for domestic workers could be an effective political strategy. But we should recognise that these arguments are political, not economic.

Although US tariffs may help create jobs in the solar-panel industry, those would be offset by job losses in the solar-energy installation sector, which relies on low-cost equipment. Similarly, some EV production jobs would disappear if tariffs led to higher prices for battery imports. Meanwhile, many export jobs would be cut when China and other countries inevitably retaliate against western restrictions.

With US unemployment at 4%, policymakers and voters are now more concerned about inflation than jobs. Removing tariffs is the surest way for western governments to lower energy and transportation prices, thereby reducing inflation. This is yet another example of how international trade could lower the costs of the clean-energy transition – if we were to embrace it.

5d ago 21.12 CEST A summary of today's developments Four men were arrested on Tuesday on suspicion of aggravated trespass at the prime minister’s constituency home in Yorkshire, police said. The suspects were arrested in the grounds of Rishi Sunak’s home in Kirby Sigston, near Northallerton, at around 12:40pm before being escorted off the property, North Yorkshire Police said. The force said the men included a 52-year-old from London, a 43-year-old from Bolton, a 21-year-old from Manchester, and a 20-year-old from Chichester. They remain in police custody and inquiries are ongoing.

The Labour party said it is suspending one of its candidates, Kevin Craig, because he is being investigated by the Gambling Commission. Craig is the party’s candidate in Central Suffolk and North Ipswich. It is understood that Craig is being investigated for betting against himself. He said: “I am deeply sorry to the many dedicated and loyal local Labour party volunteers who have been supporting my campaign. I will comply fully with the investigation.”

The news broke after a day of other developments in the election betting scandal. This morning, after prevaricating for days, the Conservative party said it was suspending two of its candidates who are being investigated over suspect bets placed on the timing of the election. And this afternoon the Metropolitan police said five more of its officers are being investigated by the commission, also over suspect election date bets. The allegation is that bets were placed by people who had access to inside information about Rishi Sunak opting for July. One of the Tory candidates, Craig Williams, has issued a statement saying that, although he made an error of judgment, he did not commit an offence.

Russell George, a Conservative member of the Senedd, has stepped back from the Welsh shadow cabinet as he faces an investigation by the gambling watchdog over alleged bets on the timing of the General Election. George represents Montgomeryshire in the Welsh parliament – the same area that Craig Williams, the Tory candidate who has had party support withdrawn as he faces similar allegations, represented at Westminster.

Keir Starmer has vowed to make tackling knife crime a “moral mission” at an emotional meeting with victims’ families and the actor Idris Elba.

Victoria Atkins, the health secretary, accused Labour of planning “to eradicate women from our national language” as the Conservatives sought to ramp up attacks on Keir Starmer around gender identity issues.

The equalities minister Kemi Badenoch said she “will not shut up” after David Tennant suggested she should at the British LGBT Awards. Badenoch accused the ex-Doctor Who actor of being a “rich, lefty, white male celebrity so blinded by ideology” in a post on X. Tennant, who won Celebrity Ally at a ceremony on Friday, received cheers and applause when he said of the Conservative Cabinet minister: “I don’t wish ill of her, I just wish her to shut up.” Badenoch said in response: “I will not shut up. I will not be silenced by men who prioritise applause from Stonewall over the safety of women and girls.” Share

George represents Montgomeryshire in the Welsh parliament – the same area that Craig Williams, the Tory candidate who has had party support withdrawn as he faces similar allegations, represented at Westminster. Welsh Conservative leader Andrew RT Davies said: “Russell George has informed me that he has received a letter from the Gambling Commission regarding bets on the timing of the General Election. “Russell George has stepped back from the Welsh Conservative shadow cabinet while these investigations are ongoing. “All other members of the Welsh Conservative Group have confirmed that they have not placed any bets. “I will not issue further comment on this ongoing process, recognising the Gambling Commission’s instruction for confidentiality to protect the integrity of the process.” George said he would “co-operate fully” with the inquiry. In a statement, he said it was “the Gambling Commission, not the media” that has the responsibility and powers to properly probe the matter, and that he would not be commenting further.

The incident took place shortly after midday on Tuesday when a white Volkswagen Scirocco hit the barriers at the entrance. Sunak was not at the manor house at the time and was attending events linked to the Japanese state visit in London.



Thames Valley Police said the driver, who was a 44-year-old man from the county, was arrested on suspicion of criminal damage and drink driving, and was the only person in the car.



A spokesperson added the driver “suffered serious injuries” and was taken to hospital, “where he remains”.



“While we are still in the very early stages of our investigation, there is currently no evidence to suggest there was any intention to harm anyone,” the force added. Share Updated at 21.11 CEST

The Guardian,https://www.theguardian.com/business/article/2024/jun/26/human-rights-group-fca-shein-lse-flotation-uyghurs,2024-06-26,16:11:48 UTC,Human rights group urges UK financial regulator to block Shein’s LSE flotation,"A human rights group has urged Britain’s financial regulator to block the Chinese fast-fashion retailer Shein’s planned blockbuster flotation on the London Stock Exchange.

Stop Uyghur Genocide, a UK-based human rights charity that alleges minority Uyghur people are being used as forced labour at some of Shein’s cotton suppliers in China’s north-western Xinjiang region, has begun a legal campaign against the planned stock market listing.

Represented by the law firm Leigh Day, the campaign group has written to the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) to argue that “any attempt by Shein to list on the LSE should be refused”.

The China-founded company, which was valued at $66bn (£52bn) in a fundraising round last year, began to explore a listing on the LSE early this year, and is expected to file a prospectus with the UK regulator soon. Shein abandoned its original plan to list in New York after opposition from US politicians.

On Tuesday, Amnesty International UK said Shein’s potential London listing would be a “badge of shame” for the London market because of the fast-fashion firm’s “questionable” labour and human rights standards.

The fast-fashion retailer said on Wednesday: “Shein has a zero-tolerance policy for forced labour and we are committed to respecting human rights. We take visibility across our entire supply chain seriously and we require our contract manufacturers to only source cotton from approved regions.”

Stop Uyghur Genocide said it had reminded the FCA that its US counterpart, the Securities and Exchange Commission, has already refused to recommend the listing of Shein for trading on the US stock exchange because of concerns around labour practices in the company’s supply chains.

The group said the London listing should not be allowed to go ahead because the UK has signed up to International Labour Organization conventions, which set out minimum standards for engaging workers. Any concerns about companies engaging workers in their supply chains that may breach those minimum standards are inconsistent with the UK’s convention obligations, it said.

“The FCA has a statutory duty of integrity and to protect its investors,” the group added.

The Leigh Day solicitor Ricardo Gama, who represents Stop Uyghur Genocide, said: “Stop Uyghur Genocide expects UK financial institutions to uphold the high ethical standards that they pay lip service to, and to make clear that London isn’t the place to come for a ‘no questions asked’ approach to capital. At the very minimum regulators must make sure that laws in place to root out modern slavery are complied with.”

Stop Uyghur Genocide said it was concerned about the London Stock Exchange’s ability to detect and respond to any alleged forced labour in Shein’s supply chains.

Stop Uyghur Genocide is preparing a detailed submission to the regulator to support its letter.

In the meantime, the campaign group’s lawyers have asked the FCA to obtain more information from Shein about the “accuracy of its published modern slavery statement”.



Under the Modern Slavery Act, large businesses have to publish a statement every year that sets out the measures they have taken to ensure slavery and trafficking do not occur in their own operations and their supply chains.

Leigh Day lawyers have urged the regulator to “refuse Shein’s listing application unless the FCA is satisfied that its products are not tainted by forced labour”.

Rahima Mahmut, executive director of Stop Uyghur Genocide, said she was “deeply concerned” about Shein’s potential London listing and said the organisation had been highlighting concerns from national security and human rights experts that Shein “could be associated with egregious human rights abuses, including modern slavery, and pose ethical and security risks to businesses and citizens”.

“Our investment community must not support companies like Shein who are reportedly linked to the Chinese state and which we believe may enable the ongoing genocidal policies against Uyghurs.”

The FCA declined to comment on Shein’s potential listing. It noted that it has no investigation or enforcement powers relating to alleged breaches of legislation not within its remit, such as the Modern Slavery Act or tax legislation.

Before a company’s shares can be admitted to the LSE, the firm must apply to the FCA for admission to listing and to approve its prospectus. The watchdog said it was the company’s responsibility to ensure the information in its prospectus is accurate, and not the FCA’s role to independently verify the accurate of information.

Michael Polak, barrister and chair of Lawyers for Uyghur Rights, said: “A firm alleged to have involvement in goods directly produced by slave labour in the Uyghur region creates a risk that those vital principles will be violated. We will ask the FCA to consider the expert evidence that we will provide to them before deciding on a public listing in the UK.”","A human rights group has urged Britain’s financial regulator to block the Chinese fast-fashion retailer Shein’s planned blockbuster flotation on the London Stock Exchange.

6d ago 16.12 CEST US consumer confidence dips US consumer morale has dropped this month, a new survey shows, but was stronger than expected. The Conference Board’s consumer confidence index dipped in June to 100.4, down from 101.3 in May. Economists had expected it would fall more, to exactly 100. The decline was due to a deteriorating short-term outlook for income, business, and conditions in the jobs market. Dana M. Peterson, chief economist at The Conference Board, explains: “Confidence pulled back in June but remained within the same narrow range that’s held throughout the past two years, as strength in current labor market views continued to outweigh concerns about the future. However, if material weaknesses in the labor market appear, Confidence could weaken as the year progresses.” 📈😁Americans are feeling confident!

6d ago 15.22 CEST A summer of savings: Barclays and HSBC to cut fixed-rate mortgage deals Rupert Jones HSBC and Barclays are cutting rates on their fixed mortgage deals in what some brokers claim could be the start of a “summer of savings” for homebuyers and those looking to remortgage. Barclays has reduced rates by more than 0.25 percentage points in some cases from Tuesday, and its cuts led to a quick response from HSBC, which said it would be cutting rates across its home loans range with effect from Wednesday. While new home loan rates have been broadly stable over the last month or two, the pricing of some deals has crept up. However, recent improvements to money market swap rates – which largely determine the pricing of new fixed deals – appear to have prompted two of the biggest mortgage lenders to reduce their rates, with others predicted to follow suit.

6d ago 15.03 CEST Over in Canada, inflation has jumped unexpectedly. Consumer prices across the Canadian economy rose by 2.9% in the year to May, up from 2.7% in April, dashing hopes of a small fall. This may be slightly awkward for the Bank of Canada, which cut interest rates earlier this month. 🔴 ⚠️ BREAKING: CANADIAN CPI YOY ACTUAL 2.9% (FORECAST 2.6%, PREVIOUS 2.7%) $MACRO — FinancialJuice (@financialjuice) June 25, 2024 Statistics Canada said the increase was due to higher prices for services, which rose 4.6% in May following a 4.2% increase in April. Faster price growth for services was led by cellular services, travel tours, rent and air transportation. Prices for goods (+1.0%) grew at the same rate as in April. Not a surprise in the least. Canada’s inflation rate is largely driven by enternal factors outside of the control of Canada. Inflation will continue to be stubbornly sticky as the world continues to “deglobalize” and conflicts continue to rise. https://t.co/mDefl7oZ9g — John Ruffolo (@ruffoloj) June 25, 2024 Share Updated at 15.20 CEST

6d ago 14.44 CEST Amnesty: Shein’s floatation would be a ‘badge of shame’ for London Stock Exchange Human rights organisation Amnesty International has hit out at plans for China’s fast fashion group Shein to float on the London Stock Exchange. It emerged yesterday that Shein has confidentially filed for a public listing in London, which could value the company at around £50bn. This would be London’s biggest ever float. Shein wins Labour support as it prepares £50bn London listing Read more But Dominique Muller, Amnesty International researcher specialising in the garment industry, says the City should demand transparent and binding safeguards regarding human rights standards, before admitting Shein to the fold: ​“It’s deeply troubling that a company with questionable labour and human rights standards and an unsustainable fast fashion business model could be set to reap hundreds of millions of pounds via a sale of shares and a listing on the London Stock Exchange. “Where SHEIN goes, others will try to follow. The UK authorities and the London Stock Exchange should not facilitate SHEIN’s listing until transparent and binding safeguards regarding internationally accepted human rights standards covering its entire supply chain are agreed and applied, and any abuses identified fully remedied. “Rewarding SHEIN’s current methods via a flotation would be a badge of shame for the London Stock Exchange, the bankers helping bring it to market, and any investors set to profit from it. It would be an appalling example of a process which delivers for the rich by squeezing the poor. It validates the view that it is acceptable to regard workers and their rights, company products and the environment as expendable – which cheapens us all. “It is essential the new UK government does not allow a race to the bottom in terms of corporate and human rights standards. It should require companies to prevent serious environmental harms and human rights abuses occurring throughout their entire operations and supply chains. It should enable workers whose rights are abused by company activities anywhere in the world recourse to justice through UK courts.” Shein has been accused of using forced labour to make its affordable clothing, such as t-shirts and sweaters. ‘Worst of the worst’: why is fast fashion retailer Shein launching a reality show? Read more The Mail on Sunday reported last weekend that Shein may scrap its London float plans, amid growing disquiet in Beijing over the way the fast-fashion retailer is portrayed in the UK.

6d ago 14.25 CEST Fed Governor Bowman open to raising rates if inflation doesn’t improve A US central bank policymaker has indicated she would be open to raising interest rates if inflation not fall as hoped. In a speech in London today, Federal Reserve governor Michelle Bowman also said the time is not right yet to start lowering borrowing costs. Bowman explained: Should the incoming data indicate that inflation is moving sustainably toward our 2% goal, it will eventually become appropriate to gradually lower the federal funds rate to prevent monetary policy from becoming overly restrictive. However, we are still not yet at the point where it is appropriate to lower the policy rate. In my view, we should consider a range of possible scenarios that could unfold when considering how the FOMC’s monetary policy decisions may evolve. I remain willing to raise the target range for the federal funds rate at a future meeting should progress on inflation stall or even reverse. Latest comments from Fed's Bowman, though at the more hawkish end of the spectrum, suggest chances of the US Fed cutting rates this year (notwithstanding the Nov Presidential Elections) rapidly receding.

The UK managing director of Stellantis said the company did not want to shut operations in the UK but it would make a decision in “less than a year” in the face of unreasonable government sales quotas and lack of consumer incentives in relation to VAT on vehicles and electricity.

I want to keep the production [in the] UK and I want to be clear on this.” She added that the demand for electric vehicles was “soft” and unless there were further incentives for businesses to buy the electric commercial vehicles or more support from the government it may have no choice.

7d ago 15.52 CEST The Bloomberg debate wrapped up with quick statements from the two protagonists. Jonathan Reynolds goes first, saying businesses are facing too many serious challenges to risk another five years of a chaotic and unstable government. “It’s time to return to a government that solves problems, rather than causing then”, he says, pledging to keep working with businesses after the election. Kemi Badenoch says the difference between the two parties is that Labour want to bring in new laws that make it harder to hire staff, and to micro manage businesses. Conservatives believe in capitalism, she pledges, the power of business to do good. “We don’t think profit is a dirty word, and we are optimistic about our future,” Badenoch concludes. Share Updated at 16.21 CEST

7d ago 15.47 CEST Badenoch and Reynolds on leadership ambitions And finally… Q: Bloomberg turns to its guests’ leadership ambitions. Jonathan Reynolds gets the giggles, turning red, before insisting he is “very much focused” on becoming the secretary state for business and trade. Keir Starmer has done a “quite exceptional” job of turning Labour around, he adds. Kemi Badenoch (who has been cited as a potential leader if the Conservatives are hammered in next month’s election) says the question was obviously meant for her (getting Reynolds guffawing). Badenoch says she stood for the leadership before, and lost, and is now “terrified” at the prospect of Labour coming into power. She insisted there was “no better job” than Business and Trade Secretary, which “is a lot easier and a lot less pressured than being prime minister”. Q: Some cabinet ministers may lose their seats… would you be up for the leadership challenge if it came up? Badenoch says leadership issues will be discussed after the election, not before…. That doesn’t exactly rule out a Badenoch bid… and appears to leave the door open for one…. Share Updated at 16.22 CEST

7d ago 15.40 CEST Q: Should Thames Water be nationalised? Kemi Badenoch says Thames Water is a “very, very difficult” situation; she doesn’t want to move markets by discussing nationalisation while it is going through difficulties. Reminder: The Guardian reported in April that the government was considering radical plans to renationalise Thames Water, under which most of its £15.6bn debt would be added to the public purse. The palava with Thames Water shows that the UK’s regulatory system is not working well, as the company tries to make a profit, keep bills low, and invest in infrastructure. Jonathan Reynolds says people are unhappy about the state of the UK water industry. Reynolds hopes that nationalisation can be avoided, pointing out that investment must involve losing as well as gaining money. Share

7d ago 15.35 CEST Reynolds: Shein London listing would help regulate company Onto topical issues. Q: Have you met with Shein, and would you put any restrictions if they chose to list in the UK [a decision which is moving closer…]. Jonathan Reynolds says Labour have met with Shein. Many people who are considering economic activity in the UK have spoken to Labour in recent years, he explains. His view is that if companies are doing businesses in the UK, they should be regulated from the UK. So, a listing would be the way to enforce the “highest standards” on, for example, the labour market, regulatory compliance, or tax. Any listed company in the UK has a fairly significant set of compliance placed upon them. If you are keen to see businesses operating to the highest standards, you should want to see them do that from the UK. Kemi Badenoch, the current business and trade secretary, reveals she has NOT met with Shein. She has two concerns with a potential Shein listing in London. 1) The way Shein ships individually packaged orders directly from Chinese warehouses to consumers’ homes, meaning they fall below the £135 threshold for import duty “That could mean quite a lot lost in terms of taxes,” Badenoch says. 2) Concerns that Shein are using forced labor in Xinjiang. Share

7d ago 15.23 CEST Q: What’s your policy on money from the Middle East and China? Jonathan Reynolds says Labour is extremely keen to bring in overseas investment. The Gulf is an “obvious place to look for that” money, he says, while China brings different considerations in terms of national security. Labour will hold an investment summit in its first 100 days of power, he says, and ‘make the case’ for investing in Britain. ‘It won’t take as long as people think’: Rachel Reeves on being ‘scrappy’ – and changing Britain Read more Reynolds says many of Labour’s plans come from the “reasonable complaints” of businesses who said they considered investing in the UK, but were put off by the prime minister changing, or because they didn’t know the country’s plans post-2016 (the year of the Brexit vote). Kemi Badenoch says the UK already has the largest foreign domestic investment of an European country. Share Updated at 15.24 CEST

7d ago 15.18 CEST Q: What will you do to help small businesses get paid on time? Kemi Badenoch says it is “extraordinary” how larger corporations treat smaller firms in their supply chain. “We will look again” at more regulations to speed up payments, she pledges. Jonathan Reynolds says Labour would force the audit committees of large public companies to say how quickly they pay their suppliers – that would address the power inbalance that allows them to leave small firms waiting for money…. Share

7d ago 15.11 CEST Kemi Badenoch is then asked about why more trade deals haven’t been signed. Badenoch says the US government is not signing any free trade deals at the moment, so the UK has been signing agreements with individual US states instead. It has been “very difficult” negotiating with India, she adds; any deal with Delhi has to work for business. UK and India put free trade deal talks on ice until later this year Read more Share

7d ago 15.07 CEST Jonathan Reynolds says Labour will improve the UK’s relationship with the European Union – starting with it not being governed by the internal politics of the Conservative Party. He says Labour will seek to reduce checks on food and agricultural products, and to improve the mutual recognition of professional qualifications. Reynolds argues that ‘relitigating the arguments on the customs unions or the single markets would not provide the stability Britain needs. Q: The EU say they’re open to negotiating a deal to ease border friction for fresh food, for example, but it must have a role for the European Court of Justice. Will you accept that? Reynolds says Labour won’t give away its negotiating hand. But surely, if you don’t want lower food standards than the EU, you can remove some of the trade frictions and costs. Kemi Badenoch says the Conservative government tried to strike such a deal, but the EU wouldn’t accept it. She insists the UK can’t accept oversight by the ECJ. Share

7d ago 14.59 CEST Onto Brexit! Q: What is your top proposal to cut costs for businesses exporting to the EU? Kemi Badenoch claims that it’s hard to tell the impact of Brexit, versus the impact of the pandemic. But she insists that services exports have been “going gangbusters”, making the UK the 2nd largest services exporter, and the 4th largest exporter in the world. “Those are facts”. Well….. this thread from Sky News’s Ed Conway shows that the picture is not quite as rosy as that: First thing to say is that the bare bones of the claim are certainly true.

Between 2021 and 2022 the UK did indeed rise from 7th in the league table of the world's biggest exporters (counting both goods and services) to 4th.

We'll get to why this happened in a moment. But still pic.twitter.com/jaZfDbHbsx — Ed Conway (@EdConwaySky) June 23, 2024 However here's some (very) important context.

It's not like the UK has only JUST hit fourth spot. In fact, it was in 4th place in 2020. And in 2015, 2014 and 2013.

Actually if you look at the modal average of our position in the past decade it was... fourth. pic.twitter.com/mKOsTe2Qtu — Ed Conway (@EdConwaySky) June 23, 2024 So that ""leapfrogging"" notion is wrong.

If anything the outlier here was 2021, where we dropped to the lowest position we'd EVER been in, going back two decades or so.

Raising the question: what happened? Forget leapfrogging - why did we drop down?

Brexit? Covid? Something else? pic.twitter.com/V3VlkjFLGy — Ed Conway (@EdConwaySky) June 23, 2024 Having looked into this, I can tell you at least part of the answer comes back to gold.

If u follow me you've prob already heard this, but UK trade figs are MASSIVELY distorted by flows of gold into & out of London vaults.

Film I made about this years ago https://t.co/Vgd3ONcNZQ — Ed Conway (@EdConwaySky) June 23, 2024 And gold flows have been a very big distortionary factor in UK trade post 2019. Just LOOK at how much of the total UK export figure since then has been gold: a LOT.

Even tho we don't mine sizeable amounts of gold, it's routinely been one of our biggest ""exports"" in recent years pic.twitter.com/SVP6sWfngY — Ed Conway (@EdConwaySky) June 23, 2024 Now, nearly every trade statistician agrees you should exclude gold from trade stats. After all, this is more of a financial transaction than a traded good.

The @ONS already excludes gold from most of its figs. More on this here: https://t.co/Ihz5gH6rY0 — Ed Conway (@EdConwaySky) June 23, 2024 But those UNCTAD trade league tables don't, as far as I can tell, exclude gold.

And this is relevant. Because look: in 2021 UK gold exports dropped a LOT. In 2022 they bounced back to the highest level ever, boosting TOTAL UK exports by a whopping 4% (that's MASSIVE). pic.twitter.com/GAPDjsETGJ — Ed Conway (@EdConwaySky) June 23, 2024 Raising the question, what does our trade picture look like if you EXCLUDE gold.

Are we still in fourth place?

In short: no.

Look, ex gold, our ranking would have been 6th last year. Not 4th.

In fact we wouldn't have hit 6th since 2015. Which is consistent with other datapoints. pic.twitter.com/POeOJU04pf — Ed Conway (@EdConwaySky) June 23, 2024 Share

7d ago 14.53 CEST Reynolds: Need to escape low-growth, high-tax, poor-services doom loop Next issue – fiscal issues, and the IMF’s warning that both major parties’ manifestos are too opaque and lack detail on tax and spend. Q: They say voters will be voting in a knowledge vacuum…. Kemi Badenoch says she “completely disagrees” with IFS’s assessment. The truth is that people are not placing their votes based on the IFS’s analysis, but actually base it on what a party believes in, and what its values are. She says the mini-budget showed the problems of cutting tax without cutting spending. We are the party of sound money, of business, Badenoch promises. Jonathan Reynolds says he respects the IFS…. and agrees that the Conservatives record speaks for itself (!). Taxes are at a record high, and public services don’t reflect that tax burden. The key is to break out of this low-growth, high-tax, poor-services doom loop, Reynolds says – and that’s Labour’s plan. He says the UK would have billions of pounds more, if the economy had grown at the rate of the last Labour government. Q: Are you ready to fight interest groups which won’t like the planning changes you have in mind? Reynolds says that’s why Labour needs a mandate, so it can build the homes and infrastructure Britain needs. Kemi Badenoch disputes this claim, pointing out that Labour members of the House of Lords had blocked the government’s attempts to remove nutrient neutrality rules, and free up housebuilding. Share

7d ago 14.40 CEST Reynoldsd defends Labour's plans for workers rights Next, a question on Labour’s plans for more protection against unfair dismissal, and ending zero-hours contracts. Q: Is a Labour government going to make life much harder for small businesses? Jonathan Reynolds says Labour’s manifesto is “a pro-worker, pro-business” agenda, that – he says – has been developed closely with businesses. That includes a better business environment, changes to planning rules, certainty on tax, that will deliver more growth. Reynolds adds that “The floor will rise”, but insists the vast majority of businesses are already operating at a much higher level than this new, higher floor already. Kemi Badenoch hits back, saying it’s businesses don’t want these measures. She claims it’s “unbelievable” that Reynolds claims these new regulations have been developed with businesses. She insists: Businesss is terrified of what Labour is selling. Badenoch says Labour’s plans for employment rights from day one are unpopular, and that the CEOs of Asda, Currys [see here] and M&S have said these are “terrible regulations”. Reynolds returns fire, saying that the Conservative Party promised an employment bill after Brexit, and security in the workplace, and hasn’t delivered on it. Labour, he says, will create a better working environment, one where people have secure work they can build a family round. Badenoch won’t accept this, telling business leaders they should be “absolutely terrified” of “surrendering” your business, the economy, and tax, to Labour. Badenoch argues that Labour are “fishing in an empty barrel”, and that flexible working rights are not the cause of problems in the UK economy. Share Updated at 14.52 CEST

7d ago 14.25 CEST Jonathan Reynolds agrees that governments must change their plans when circumstances change… …and blames Liz Truss’s “disastrous mini-budget” for forcing Labour to drop its £28bn green investment plans. He then returns to his criticism of Rishi Sunak’s climate u-turn speech last September, in which the PM pushed back the deadline for selling new petrol and diesel cars and the phasing out of gas boilers. That was a “short-lived relaunch of the Rishi Sunak premiership”, Reynolds says, to pitch the PM as a change candidate.

The Guardian,https://www.theguardian.com/business/article/2024/jun/24/london-tunnels-ipo-amsterdam-uk-markets,2024-06-24,13:18:16 UTC,London Tunnels moves IPO plan to Amsterdam in blow to UK markets,"London Tunnels, which aims to convert an abandoned underground network into a tourist attraction, has ditched plans to float in the capital, instead opting to list in Amsterdam.

The company aims to make the Kingsway exchange tunnels, a network of 8,000 sq metres under Holborn in central London, into a new attraction that will bring in 2 million visitors a year.

The group revealed on Monday that it hoped to raise £30m by listing on Euronext Amsterdam, saying it could make the most of the size and scale of the equity and capital markets of Europe by listing in the Dutch capital.

The decision comes after the company sent papers to the London Stock Exchange (LSE) in January outlining its intention to float in the capital.

At the time, its chief executive, Angus Murray, said: “This unique set of tunnels, owned by a British company, built by the British government, for the defence of Britain, that can further enhance London’s reputation as a leading tourist destination, should be listed in London.”

The change of heart by the company is the latest blow to the LSE after a number of high-profile companies opted to list in Europe and the US ahead of London in recent months.

In May, the Paddy Power owner, Flutter, announced its decision to switch its primary listing to New York, while the UK chip designer Arm opted to list on Wall Street last August after the government failed to convince it to float in London.

However, this has been partly offset by big players such as the fashion retail company Shein and Raspberry Pi announcing plans to list on the LSE.

The Kingsway tunnels were built in the early 1940s to shelter up to 8,000 people during the blitz but were never used for this purpose.

Instead, the Special Operations Executive, responsible for organising espionage and sabotage operations in German-occupied Europe, moved in during the final two years of the war and is thought to be the inspiration for the Q branch in Ian Fleming’s James Bond novels.

The tunnels later housed the first secure transatlantic telephone cable, which ran a hotline that connected the White House and the Kremlin during the cold war, before ownership was transferred to British Telecom (BT) in 1981.

London Tunnels has agreed to buy the site from BT next year and intends to open the attraction in 2027, including exhibits celebrating the history of the tunnels, as well as reinstating the city’s deepest London bar, which closed in the 1980s.

However, the float prospectus lists a number of risk factors to the project, including the warning that plans could be delayed if it cannot get the full planning permission it needs.

Last month, it secured the planning green light from the City of London Corporation but is still awaiting planning signoff from the London borough of Camden.

The list also includes risks around whether the structural integrity of the tunnels is affected by their age, the possibility that the removal of asbestos from the tunnels may take longer than expected, and that the company may be unable to complete the acquisition of the leasehold on the agreed date of 30 June next year.

Explaining its decision for moving the listing, London Tunnels said it could meet the £20m to £30m needed over the first few years of development. It added that it would then look to raise a further £120m in debt and equity to make the tunnels operational.","London Tunnels, which aims to convert an abandoned underground network into a tourist attraction, has ditched plans to float in the capital, instead opting to list in Amsterdam.

Skynews,https://news.sky.com/story/energy-price-cap-falls-today-but-163600-lift-to-annual-bills-ahead-report-warns-13160333,2024-06-30,23:01:00 UTC,"Energy price cap falls today but £600 lift to annual bills ahead, report warns","As the latest reduction in the energy price cap takes effect, households are being warned of a big lift in bills ahead due to higher wholesale gas prices.

The cap, which limits what suppliers can charge per unit of energy, fell by 7% overnight in the wake of the latest three-month review by industry regulator Ofgem.

The reduction meant that typical 12-month bills will be around £500 cheaper than a year ago.

It left the average bill at £1,568 - a figure that will apply until the result of the next review takes effect in October.

However, a report by the Energy & Climate Intelligence Unit (ECIU) said on Monday that consumers should brace for an additional hit of up to £600 over the coming winter, largely due to higher wholesale prices.

It pointed to a possible £200 price cap hike from October on the back of some analyst calculations, suggesting it was plausible the total could remain around that level until June.

One calculation, by experts at Cornwall Insight and released on Friday, predicted a 10% - or £155 - increase from 1 October to £1,723 a year but said there remained uncertainty on the market path ahead.

Consumer groups say there is an alternative to the price cap, pointing to a growing number of fixed-rate deals on the market following a dearth of competition in recent years.

European wholesale costs are again elevated for the time of year based on pre-energy shock norms.

Recent pressures have included strong competition from Asia, particularly China, for liquefied natural gas (LNG).

That has replaced some of the Russian natural gas volumes that were stripped away in the wake of the invasion of Ukraine in February 2022.

A planned extension of the European Union's sanctions regime against Russia will see its LNG exports targeted for the first time - potentially placing further pressure on supply across the continent.

UK household costs for both gas and electricity stood at an average of just below £1,090 ahead of the Russia-Ukraine war.

The ECIU report said: ""By September 2025, the average household could have paid an extra £2,600 on energy bills during the ongoing gas crisis.

""With the government also spending £1,400 per home earlier in the crisis, the total extra costs could be £4,000 per home, and counting.""

Energy has been among the big battlegrounds of the election.

Much of the debate has centred on costs but the impact of gas use in particular has fuelled argument too on the UK's climate commitments.

Dr Simon Cran-McGreehin, head of analysis at ECIU, said: ""The UK's high dependence on gas for electricity generation and heating has cost bill payers £2,000 so far during the gas crisis and the economy as a whole tens of billions of pounds.

""Common sense measures like investing in insulating the poorest homes, switching to electric heat pumps and fast-tracking British renewables will leave us less vulnerable to the whims of the international gas markets.

""North Sea gas output is declining so unless we make the switch we'll be ever more dependent on foreign imports.

""The maths is clear, when it comes to energy independence, new drilling licences are a side show making a marginal difference compared to the immense quantity of homegrown energy that offshore wind and other renewables can generate.""

Emily Seymour, the editor of Which? Energy, said: ""Consumers will be relieved to hear that the price cap is dropping by around £122 for the typical household from 1st July.""

She added: ""With the price cap predicted to rise again in October, many consumers will also be wondering whether to fix their energy deal.

""There's no 'one size fits all' approach but the first step is to compare your monthly payments on the price cap to any fixed deals to see what the best option is for you.

""As a rule of thumb, if you want to fix, we'd recommend looking for deals as close to the July price cap as possible, not longer than 12 months and without significant exit fees.""","As the latest reduction in the energy price cap takes effect, households are being warned of a big lift in bills ahead due to higher wholesale gas prices.

And it has a point. Most obviously (and this is the main thing the IFS is complaining about) none of the major manifestos - from Labour, the Liberal Democrats and the Conservative parties - have been clear about how they will fill an impending black hole in the government's spending plans.

No need to go into all the gritty details, but the overarching point is that all government spending plans include some broad assumptions about how much spending (and for that matter, taxes and economic growth) will grow in the coming years. Economists call this the ""baseline"".

But there's a problem with this baseline - it assumes quite a slow increase in overall government spending in the next four years, an average of about 1 per cent a year after accounting for inflation. Which doesn't sound too bad - except that we all know from experience that NHS spending always grows more quickly than that, and that 1% needs to accommodate all sorts of other promises, like increasing schools and defence spending and so on.

Image: NHS spending grows more quickly than the 'baseline'

If all those bits of government are going to consume quite a lot of that extra money (far more than a 1% increase, certainly) then other bits of government won't get as much. In fact, the IFS reckons those other bits of government - from the Home Office to the legal system - will face annual cuts of 3.5 per cent. In other words, it's austerity all over again.

But here's the genius thing (for the politicians, at least). While they have to set a baseline, to make all their other sums add up, the dysfunctional nature of the way government sets its spending budgets means it only has to fill in the small print about which department gets what when it does a spending review. And that spending review isn't due until after the election.

The upshot is all the parties can pretend they've signed up to the baseline even when it's patently obvious that more money will be needed for those unprotected departments (or else it's a return to austerity).

So yes, the IFS is right: the numbers in each manifesto, including Labour's, are massively overshadowed by this other bigger conspiracy of silence.

But I would argue that actually the conspiracy of silence goes even deeper. Because it's not just fiscal baselines we're not talking about enough. Consider five other issues none of the major parties are confronting (when I say major parties, in this case I'm talking about the Conservative, Labour and Lib Dem manifestos - to some extent the Green and Reform manifestos are somewhat less guilty of these particular sins, even if they commit others).

Taxes going up

First, for all their promises not to raise any of the major tax rates (something Labour, the Conservatives and Lib Dems have all committed to) the reality is taxes are going up. We will all be paying more in taxes by the end of the parliament compared with today.

Indeed, we'll all be paying more income tax. Except that we'll be paying more of it because we'll be paying tax on more of our income - that's the inexorable logic of freezing the thresholds at which you start paying certain rates of tax (which is what this government has done - and none of the other parties say they'll reverse).

Second, the main parties might say they believe in different things, but they all seem to believe in one particular offbeat religion: the magic tax avoidance money tree. All three of these manifestos assume they will make enormous sums - more, actually, than from any single other money-raising measure - from tightening up tax avoidance rules.

While it's perfectly plausible that you could raise at least some money from clamping down on tax avoidance, it's hardly a slam-dunk. That this is the centrepiece of each party's money-raising efforts says a lot. And, another thing that's often glossed over: raising more money this way will also raise the tax burden.

Image: Should the Bank of England be paying large sums in interest to banks? File pic: AP

Third is another thing all the parties agree on and are desperate not to question: the fiscal rules. The government has a set of rules requiring it to keep borrowing and (more importantly given where the numbers are right now) total debt down to a certain level.

But here's the thing. These rules are not god-given. They are not necessarily even all that good. The debt rule is utterly gameable. It hasn't stopped the Conservatives from raising the national debt to the highest level in decades. And it's not altogether clear the particular measure of debt being used (net debt excluding Bank of England interventions) is even the right one.

Which raises another micro-conspiracy. Of all the parties at this election, the only one talking about whether the Bank of England should really be paying large sums in interest to banks as it winds up its quantitative easing programme is the Reform Party. This policy, first posited by a left-wing thinktank (the New Economics Foundation), is something many economists are discussing. It's something the Labour Party will quite plausibly carry out to raise some extra money if it gets elected. But no one wants to discuss it. Odd.

Brexit impact

Anyway, the fourth issue everyone seems to have agreed not to discuss is, you've guessed it, Brexit. While the 2019 election was all about Brexit, this one, by contrast, has barely featured the B word. Perhaps you're relieved. For a lot of people we've talked so much about Brexit over the past decade or so that, frankly, we need a bit of a break. That's certainly what the main parties seem to have concluded.

But while the impact of leaving the European Union is often overstated (no, it's not responsible for every one of our economic problems) it's far from irrelevant to our economic plight. And where we go with our economic neighbours is a non-trivial issue in the future.

Anyway, this brings us to the fifth and final thing no one is talking about. The fact that pretty much all the guff spouted on the campaign trail is completely dwarfed by bigger international issues they seem reluctant or ill-equipped to discuss. Take the example of China and electric cars.

Image: Brexit has barely featured in the election. File pic: Victoria Jones/PA

Just recently, both the US and European Union have announced large tariffs on the import of Chinese EVs. Now, in America's case those tariffs are primarily performative (the country imports only a tiny quantity of Chinese EVs). But in Europe's case, Chinese EVs are a very substantial part of the market - same for the UK.

Raising the question: what is the UK going to do? You could make a strong case for saying Britain should be emulating the EU and US, in an effort to protect the domestic car market. After all, failing to impose tariffs will mean this country will have a tidal wave of cars coming from China (especially since they can no longer go to the rest of the continent without facing tariffs) which will make it even harder for domestic carmakers to compete. And they're already struggling to compete.

By the same token, imposing tariffs will mean the cost of those cheap Chinese-made cars (think: MGs, most Teslas and all those newfangled BYDs and so on) will go up. A lot. Is this really the right moment to impose those extra costs on consumers?

In short, this is quite a big issue. Yet it hasn't come up as a big issue in this campaign - which is madness. But then you could say the same thing about, say, the broader race for minerals, about net zero policy more widely and about how we're going to go about tightening up sanctions on Russia to make them more effective.

Parochial election

Elections are always parochial but given the scale of these big, international issues (and there are many more), this one feels especially parochial.

So in short: yes, there have been lots of gaps. Enormous gaps. The ""conspiracy of silence"" goes way, way beyond the stuff the IFS has talked about.

But 'twas ever thus.

Think back to the last time a political party actually confronted some long-standing issues no one wanted to talk about in their manifesto. I'm talking about the 2017 Conservative manifesto, which pledged to resolve the mess of social care in this country, once and for all.

It sought to confront a big social issue, intergenerational inequality, in so doing ensuring younger people wouldn't have to subsidise the elderly.

The manifesto was an absolute, abject, electoral disaster. It was largely responsible for Theresa May's slide in the polls from a 20-point lead to a hung parliament.

And while most people don't talk about that manifesto anymore, make no mistake: today's political strategists won't forget it in a hurry. Hence why this year's campaign and this year's major manifestos are so thin.

Elections are rarely won on policy proposals. But they are sometimes lost on them.","The Institute for Fiscal Studies (IFS) says there's a conspiracy of silence at this election - that all of the major political parties aren't being honest enough about their fiscal plans.

Skynews,https://news.sky.com/story/boots-chief-james-to-run-ophthalmology-chain-veonet-13161258,2024-06-30,10:12:00 UTC,Boots chief James to run ophthalmology chain Veonet,"The outgoing boss of Boots is leaving to run Veonet, one of Europe’s largest chains of ophthalmology clinics.

Sky News has learnt that Sebastian James is to become the new group chief executive of Veonet, which is owned by the private equity firm PAI Partners and Canada's Ontario Teachers Pension Plan.

He will leave Boots in November, as Sky News revealed on Saturday, and will join Veonet soon afterwards, insiders said.

Veonet was acquired by its current owners in early 2022 from Nordic Capital, another buyout firm.

In the UK, Veonet owns SpaMedica, which performs eye operations such as cataract removals for the NHS.

Overall, the group provides eye care services to more than 2m patients annually across five European markets, including Germany, the Netherlands and Spain.

Dr Markus Hamm, the current Veonet CEO, is retiring but will remain on its board.

Mr James is leaving Boots after its parent, Walgreens Boots Alliance, abandoned plans to sell or float the pharmacy chain for a second time in two years.

His departure will come during the retailer's 175th anniversary year.

An announcement about his exit from Boots and appointment at Veonet is expected to be made early this week.

Veonet could not be reached for comment, while both PAI and OTPP declined to comment.","The outgoing boss of Boots is leaving to run Veonet, one of Europe’s largest chains of ophthalmology clinics.

The exit poll is the moment millions tune in for a first sniff of the eventual result of the general election.

And in Election 2024 this poll, with its impressive track record, sometimes down to a margin of only a few seats, will, once again, be a key part of broadcasters' coverage - including here at Sky News - on Thursday night.

The current model was devised in 2005 by Professor John Curtice and statistician David Firth and it has been consistently reliable, bar 2015 when the seat numbers suggested a hung parliament and David Cameron scraped a thin majority.

But for the most part, its accuracy has been dependable. In 2010, it correctly predicted the exact number of seats for the Conservatives.

Commissioned by the broadcasters - Sky News, the BBC and ITV News - the fieldwork is carried out by IPSOS UK who will have interviewers at 133 polling stations around the country this year.

People who have just voted will be asked to privately fill in a replica ballot paper and place it into a ballot box as they leave their local community centre, church hall or station.

Michael Clemence, from IPSOS UK, says this and the scale are part of what distinguishes the exit poll from the many surveys that have come before it.

""We're going to be doing over 17,000 interviews on the day. And also we're dealing with people's behaviour. So we're not asking people how they intend to vote.

""We're talking to electors who just voted. And I'm asking exactly what they just did. So you've cut out the error in prediction polling.""

Researchers can only deploy to a fraction of the total constituencies in England, Scotland and Wales, so locations are chosen to best reflect the demographics of the country with an urban and rural spread.

However, many of the locations will be in marginal seats, where the swing between the main parties will be tracked.

The same polling stations are targeted year after year so the swing from the last election's exit poll, along with other data at constituency level, can be analysed by those crunching the numbers.

The data collected at the polling stations is sent back by interviewers to IPSOS UK at several stages throughout the day.

It's processed there and sent via a secure data pipeline to the broadcasters' statisticians and political scientists who are locked down in a secret location in the capital.

Phones confiscated in 'the bunker'

""Our phones are taken away from us, there are security guards. So we don't communicate with the outside world at all, we just talk to each other. So it's a very strange feeling - as people are still going to the polls - already having a sense of what the result will be,"" says Professor Will Jennings.

The Sky News election analyst and political scientist will be one of those inside that sealed and secret room on election day - and the key thing experts will be looking at is that change in voter behaviour.

""We'll model the change in the vote at each of those polling stations, and we'll try and look for patterns in that change and also particular characteristics of constituencies that might predict change and might predict what we're seeing across the country,"" says Professor Jennings.

""We will throw a lot of different variables at the data during the day, whether it's the percentage of the local constituency that we think voted leave in the referendum, the number of people in working class jobs, the number of people who own a car, for example, it could be anything,"" adds Professor Jennings.

""And we'll try just to look for patterns in that data to explain as much variation as possible so that we know that our estimates are as reliable as they can be.""

Skynews,https://news.sky.com/story/energy-supplier-ovo-to-explore-options-including-sale-13160749,2024-06-29,08:02:00 UTC,Energy supplier OVO to explore options including sale,"Britain's fourth-biggest household energy supplier is lining up bankers to explore options including bringing in a new investor or a sale, 15 years after it launched in a bid to challenge the industry's oligopoly.

Sky News has learnt that OVO Group, which was founded by Stephen Fitzpatrick, is close to hiring Rothschild to assist with a strategic review of the business.

City sources said this weekend that a range of possibilities would be considered during the process, which is expected to take several months.

Money blog: How to split housework fairly

These are likely to include a refinancing - with talks already underway about OVO's existing borrowings - as well as issuing new shares to prospective investors, or a partial or full sale by some of the company's shareholders.

An outright sale of the business is considered by insiders to be unlikely at this point, but is expected to be explored as part of the strategic review.

OVO, which has about four million customers, sits behind Centrica, the owner of British Gas, Octopus Energy and E.ON Next in the rankings of Britain's leading gas and electricity suppliers, according to market share data provided by Ofgem, the industry regulator.

Under Mr Fitzpatrick, who launched OVO in 2009, the company positioned itself as a challenger brand offering superior service to the industry's established players.

OVO's transformational moment came in 2020, when it bought the retail supply arm of SSE, transforming it overnight into one of Britain's leading energy companies.

Its growth has not been without difficulties, with insiders referring to a challenged relationship with Ofgem and a torrent of customer complaints about overcharging.

In recent months, OVO's shareholders have reshaped its leadership team, bringing in the former J Sainsbury chief executive Justin King as its chairman.

In May, Mr King recruited David Buttress, the former Just Eat boss who was briefly Boris Johnson's cost-of-living tsar, as the energy group's new chief executive.

Mr Buttress replaced Raman Bhatia, who left to join Starling Bank.

He is expected to focus on sharpening the company's customer service performance as well as exploring ways to further diversify its products and services.

Key to OVO's valuation will be the growth of its technology platform, Kaluza, which was set up to license its software to other energy suppliers, and provides customers with smart electric vehicle charging and heat pumps.

OVO recently announced that AGL Energy, one of Australia's biggest energy suppliers, had bought a 20% stake in Kaluza at a $500m (£395m) valuation.

Kaluza is understood to be exploring further expansion opportunities in Europe, Japan and the US.

OVO has also entered the electric vehicle car charging sector under the brand Charge Anywhere, adding 34,000 public charging points across the UK.

In 2022, OVO Group made an unadjusted loss of £1.3bn, which it blamed on a decline in the value of energy it had bought in advance to meet future supply commitments.

It said this had ""no cash impact"" in a corporate filing, and that this value would rise as customers used the energy it had bought.

Last summer, the company announced a £200m secondary share sale which saw existing investors Mayfair Equity Partners and Morgan Stanley Investment Management increasing their stakes in the company.

Other investors include Mitsubishi Corporation, the Japanese conglomerate.

Mayfair is thought to hold a stake of over 30%, while Mitsubishi owns approximately 20%.

Mr Fitzpatrick also remains a significant shareholder.

This weekend, it was unclear which of OVO's investors might seek a disposal of their interests, although insiders acknowledged that a sizeable proportion of the company's shares could end up changing hands.

Like its rivals, OVO has been contending with the impact of the industry price cap after a period of enormous price spikes which sent customers' bills soaring.

Last month, Ofgem said the cap would fall in the quarter from July to September by the annualised equivalent of £122, to £1568.

Other big players in the sector include EDF and Scottish Power, which is owned by Spain's Iberdrola.

In recent months, Octopus Energy, run by Greg Jackson, has crystallised a valuation of over £7bn by selling stakes to a number of new investors.

Centrica has a market valuation on the London Stock Exchange of £7.3bn.

OVO, whose valuation in any major transaction was unclear this weekend, declined to comment.","Britain's fourth-biggest household energy supplier is lining up bankers to explore options including bringing in a new investor or a sale, 15 years after it launched in a bid to challenge the industry's oligopoly.

Sky News has learnt that Sebastian James, who has run Boots since 2018, will leave the company in November.

City sources said this weekend that he had accepted a new role in the healthcare industry.

Money blog: How to split housework fairly

His exit comes soon after it emerged that New York-listed Walgreens Boots Alliance (WBA), the British retailer's owner, had decided for the second time in two years against pursuing a sale or stock market flotation of the chain.

An announcement about Mr James's departure is expected in the coming days.

WBA is not yet thought to have lined up a successor.

Mr James, who previously ran the electricals retailer Dixons (now named Currys), recently endorsed Sir Keir Starmer - a notable move because of his long friendship with Lord Cameron, the foreign secretary.

His departure from Boots will come during the Nottingham-based company's 175th year.

Boots employs about 52,000 people and trades from roughly 1,900 stores.

Its recent trading performance has been strong, with WBA this week saying that like-for-like sales at Boots during the quarter to the end of May rose by 6% and 5.8% across its retail and pharmacy operations respectively.

An insider said Mr James had overseen a successful turnaround, with market share having grown for 13 successive quarters.

It has been a rare bright spot for WBA, which has had a torrid time and has seen its shares slump.

A WBA spokesperson said this week: ""As Walgreens Boots Alliance continues a strategic review of the Company's assets, we took a critical look at Boots.

""While we believe there is significant interest in this business at the right time, Boots' growth, strategic strength and cashflow remain key contributors to Walgreens Boots Alliance.

""We are committed to continuing to invest in Boots UK and to find innovative ways for this business to fulfill its potential.""

During a previous auction in 2022, only one bidder - a consortium of Apollo Global Management and Reliance Industries - tabled a formal offer worth about £5.5bn.

However, growing concerns about the global economy had triggered severe doubts among large banks which help finance leveraged buyouts, with Boots among the biggest such deals in Europe.

Among the other challenges facing prospective acquirers at the time was finding an adequate solution for Boots' £8bn pension scheme - one of the largest private retirement funds in the UK.

This issue has now been resolved through an insurance deal struck with Legal & General.

Like many retailers, Boots had a turbulent pandemic, announcing 4,000 job cuts in 2020 as a consequence of a restructuring of its Nottingham head office and store management teams.

Shortly before the COVID pandemic, Boots earmarked about 200 of its UK stores for closure, a reflection of changing shopping habits.

Boots' heritage dates back to John Boot opening a herbal remedies store in Nottingham in 1849.

It opened its 1000th UK store in 1933.

In 2006, Boots merged with Alliance Unichem, a drug wholesaler, with the buyout firm KKR acquiring the combined group in an £11bn deal the following year.

Skynews,https://news.sky.com/story/post-office-inquiry-ex-fujitsu-engineer-denies-protecting-the-monster-13160319,2024-06-28,09:46:00 UTC,Post Office Inquiry: Ex-Fujitsu engineer denies 'protecting the monster',"An expert on the Post Office Horizon IT systems has denied suggestions he was ""protecting the monster"" in evidence he gave to the trial of a sub-postmaster who was wrongly convicted while pregnant.

Former senior Fujitsu engineer Gareth Jenkins told the Post Office Inquiry he did not hide glitches in the branch accounting system at the trial of Seema Misra in 2010 - widely seen as a crucial test case at the time.

Mrs Misra was jailed for 15 months on the back of his evidence as an expert witness.

On his fourth day in the witness box at the inquiry, Mr Jenkins insisted he was telling the truth about what he knew of Horizon glitches in answers to questions on the scandal from her lawyer Flora Page.

Ms Page described Horizon as an ""out of control monster"" by the time of her client's trial and added that ""hundreds of people had already had their lives ruined to protect it"".

She put it to Mr Jenkins: ""Isn't the truth that you knew Horizon was a monster and it was causing harm?""

He replied: ""No, that's not how I felt.""

Ms Page put to Mr Jenkins that he ""threw mud in the jury's eyes"", to which he said: ""I did not.""

She put it to Mr Jenkins that failing to tell the court that he knew that transactions were being injected at the counter was failing to tell the whole truth.

He said: ""I didn't think that at the time.""

It was put to him that there were ""thousands of known error log entries"", and Mr Jenkins said: ""I'm not sure how many known error log entries there were, I don't know the volumes.""

Ms Page said that during the trial Mr Jenkins was asked if he knew whether there were any problems with the Horizon system that Fujitsu was aware of, and put it to him that the truthful answer would have been ""cash accounts, remote access, tampering, bad error handling, silent faults across the system, the EPOSS code, the terrible code, hardware failures, persistent hardware failures, recovering transactions that were lost"".

Mr Jenkins replied: ""That was not how I understood the question to be.""

""You hid all these issues and problems when you gave evidence against Seema Misra, didn't you?"" Ms Page said.

He replied ""no"", then later added: ""I did not believe that I deliberately hid anything.""

Mr Jenkins, who is facing a police investigation for alleged perjury, told the inquiry in his witness statement that Post Office, which has a power to bring its own prosecutions, had applied pressure on him to support its case.

He claimed Post Office lawyer Warwick Tatford had looked over a draft of his witness statement for Mrs Misra's trial and recommended he ""make some points more strongly in favour of the Post Office"".

He explained how he thought such actions had been ""normal practice"", saying he had not understood his duties of impartiality as an expert witness in trials until 2020, by which time he had been involved in more than a dozen cases.

He later conceded, however, in his evidence that he had seen advice setting out what was expected of him in 2016, explaining that had not been the focus for him in the documents he received.

Also on Thursday, Mr Jenkins told the inquiry where he thought the blame could be laid.

""My feeling was then and is now that the issues to do with this are down to the way Post Office has behaved rather than actual faults in the Horizon system... I believe that I told the truth as I understood it at the time.""

""You were a Fujitsu man doing what Fujitsu needed you to do to protect the monster,"" Ms Page put to him.

Mr Jenkins said: ""I didn't think it was a monster.""

During his evidence, Mr Jenkins has said he was sorry for what happened to Mrs Misra.

She told Sky News on Tuesday that she would not accept that apology.","An expert on the Post Office Horizon IT systems has denied suggestions he was ""protecting the monster"" in evidence he gave to the trial of a sub-postmaster who was wrongly convicted while pregnant.

Sky News has learnt that the cinema chain and its advisers at AlixPartners have begun formally exploring a company voluntary arrangement (CVA) - a mechanism widely used by retailers and restaurant chains during the COVID pandemic to close stores and slash rents.

The details of a potential Cineworld CVA are still to be determined, with no visibility yet about any site closures or rent negotiations with landlords.

However, one insider said that an insolvency mechanism such as a CVA was now far more likely than an outright sale of the business.

Sky News revealed earlier this month that Cineworld had drafted in AlixPartners to consider a sale.

The company trades from more than 100 sites in Britain, including at the Picturehouse chain, and employs thousands of people, although its public relations adviser refused to confirm either figure.

In a statement issued to Sky News earlier in the month, it said: ""Like many businesses, we are continually reviewing our UK operations.""

Cineworld grew under the leadership of the Greidinger family into a global giant of the industry, acquiring chains including Regal in the US in 2018 and the British company of the same name four years earlier.

Its multibillion dollar debt mountain led it into crisis, though, and forced the company into Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection in 2022.

It delisted from the London Stock Exchange last August, having seen its share price collapse amid fears for its survival.

Under the deal struck last year, several billions dollars of debt were exchanged for shares, with a significant sum of new money injected into the company by a group of hedge funds and other investors.

Cineworld also operates in central and Eastern Europe, Israel and the US.

Since it emerged from bankruptcy protection, Cineworld has appointed a new leadership team, installing Eduardo Acuna, who ran Mexican cinema chain Cinepolis's operations in the Americas, as its chief executive.

Eric Foss, a former Pepsi executive, was parachuted in as Cineworld's chairman.

One property industry source previously told Sky News that an attempt by Cineworld to pursue a CVA or other restructuring which compromised landlords was likely to be met with fierce resistance.

In an update on its first growth estimate, the Office for National Statistics (ONS) said gross domestic product (GDP) rose by 0.7% between January and March.

It had originally said on 10 May that output was 0.6% up on the previous three months - a positive figure that brought to an end the shallow recession that struck during the second half of 2023.

Then, the effects of Bank of England interest rate rises to combat inflation were widely blamed by economists for choking off demand.

All the growth during the January-March period was attributable to the services sector, which accounts for almost 80% of the economy.

We have since learned there was zero growth recorded by the ONS for the month of April, with poor weather hitting construction and high streets.

The data is the last from the ONS before the country goes to the polls on 4 July - with the economy, and personal finances especially, among the topics high on voters' minds following the effects of the COVID pandemic and energy-driven cost of living crisis.

The timing of the general election has coincided with fierce debate over whether the Bank should now be cutting interest rates, allowing for an easing in borrowing costs.

At its last policy meeting just over a week ago, the rate-setting committee voted 7-2 to maintain Bank rate at 5.25%.

The minutes of the meeting betrayed continuing worries about the pace of wage growth and stubborn inflation within services.

The Bank fears that a rate rise, at this stage, risks fuelling price growth further as basic salaries grow at a pace of 6%.

The rate of inflation is currently back at its 2% target for the first time in three years.

Despite this gap in favour of consumers, with wage growth outpacing inflation since June last year, the effects of the crises since 2020 have taken their toll, according to campaigners on living standards.

The Resolution Foundation said on Friday real household disposable incomes were lower in early 2024 than they were back in late 2019.

It said growth so far in this parliament was weaker than all but two parliaments since 1910, despite growth over the past year of 2.4%.

The thinktank declared average incomes were £120 a year lower per person over the period since the last election.

Figures such as this get to the heart of the election campaign amid criticism of the main parties' lack of clarity over their tax and spending commitments.

But they also give ammunition to critics of the Bank of England who argue interest rates should come down.

In its financial stability report on Thursday, there was a further nod to pressures ahead as it warned there were still three million mortgage holders yet to feel the pain of higher interest rates in their repayments.

As things stand, financial markets and economists see August or September as the likely months for the first rate cut, barring any new shocks.

Introduction

The energy transition from CO2-emitting coal/gas to ""clean"" energy has sparked a nuclear rebirth as the most efficient clean electricity source and has driven uranium prices in the last two years, with expectations of long-term deficits prompting higher price expectations. To invest in this theme, I researched two uranium ETFs, Global X Uranium (URA) and Sprott Uranium Miners (URNM) where Cameco (NYSE:CCJ) (TSX:CCO:CA) was the top holding and thus decided to analyze the company and found it more compelling.

Performance

Cameco's share price performance mirrors uranium spot prices and has been a terrible long-term investment given the resistance to nuclear energy in the last 20 years. However, vs a portfolio of uranium stocks via the URA ETF, Cameco has done far better at capturing uranium prices. I was also curious to see how the stock faired vs clean energy companies. I compared it to Brookfield Renewable Partners (BEP), which is in a JV with Cameco that co-owns Westinghouse, and versus a large utility such as NextEra Energy (NEE). Using prices adjusted for dividends (total return) one can see that Cameco recuperated from 10 years of losses in 2023.

FactSet Created by author with data from Capital IQ

What is Cameco

Cameco, based in Canada, is the second-largest uranium miner in the world with 15% capacity, behind National Atomic Company Kazatomprom (OTC:NATKY). It also refines and produces fuel rods for nuclear power plants that represent 16% of revenue. In late 2024 Cameco acquired 49% of Westinghouse (51% Brookfield Renewable Partners), further extending its integration and exposure in the value chain to nuclear power plant maintenance and new builds.

The company has three main mining operations with McArthur River (70% stake) and Cigar Lake (55% stake) in Canada that have 43m lbs. capacity and should run at 83% utilization in 2024 up from 66% in 2023. The third, Inkai (40% stake), is in Kazakhstan with 18m lbs. capacity and is not consolidated, i.e., reported as equity income. The fuel service operation refines uranium and produces fuel rods, mostly for the Canadian nuclear fleet.

Cameco Mining Assets (Cameco)

Contracted Prices vs. Spot Market

Cameco´s realized uranium price (revenue/volume) does not directly track the spot price due to the company's commercial strategy which, utilizes a 40/60% fixed/variable price mix for long-term contacts. However, at present, about 20% of reserves or 200m lbs are in this contract terms, which means that higher prices and volumes should produce a gradual and sustainable price catch-up.

The company provided a sensitivity guideline where the realized price climbs from US$56 to US$69lb if spot prices are flat at US$80lb.

Westinghouse Nuclear

What is a new factor in the Cameco investment case is the 49% stake in Westinghouse Nuclear, a leader in nuclear plant design, construction, and maintenance. This was acquired in 4Q23 for US$2.3bn in partnership with Brookfield Renewable Partners. This provides Cameco with further integration in the nuclear value chain and may be a very positive source of earnings growth and diversification, reducing the dependence on uranium prices. According to Cameco´s 2024 guidance for Westinghouse they expect to report a net loss of $200m and from one report by Goldman Sachs (GS) earnings recovery to $500m in 2025.

Westinghouse has built 430 reactors and has developed the AP1000, with 4 in operation with 26 in construction or contracted. It has also developed an SMR (Small Modular Rector) and a Microreactor that may provide additional upside if deployed.

Equity Income Increasingly Relevant

As mentioned earlier, Westinghouse results are reported as equity income, i.e. the earnings proportional to the equity stake. These results are not added to revenue or EBITDA and unless the JVs pay dividends, equity income does not provide cash flow. Nonetheless, it is a clear indication of the JV's growth and value to Cameco. Many analysts will add equity income to EBITDA in their EV/EBITDA valuation metric, which, in my view, is not the best way to capture a JVs contribution. Below, I break down EBT (Earnings before Tax) for Cameco and its JVs to illustrate their importance.

Created by author with data from Capital IQ & Bloomberg

Consensus Estimates over 30% Earnings Growth

I gathered consensus data from 14 analysts to measure Cameco's growth and profitability metrics, which for the most part factor in the company guidance for 2024, which assumes more than doubling EBITDA margin on stronger uranium prices. For 2025 and 2026 the market expects margins to increase to 60% on higher volumes and prices as discussed earlier on Cameco´s contract commercial terms. Earnings get a further boost from Westinghouse equity income contribution where analysts have less clarity, but some are forecasting over US$500m or US$250m to Cameco which seems under-estimated and may provide for earnings upgrades.

Cameco Consensus Estimates (Created by author with data from Capital IQ)

Valuation

The consensus has a US$56 price target that backs into an implied PE (cash) of 52x and a PEG of 1.9 which are premium valuations but not out of context with historic ranges. Note that I use cash earnings for capital-intensive companies, which is calculated with net income plus depreciation. In the case of Cameco this metric includes its substantial equity income, the earnings from Westinghouse and Inkai mine in Kazakhstan.

The 2025 price target of US$77 is based on a 1.5x PEG that, given the increasing earnings growth, translates into a 51x cash PE ratio. The same methodology points to a US$100 price target for YE26 on the company's continuing growth and profitability drivers.

Consensus Valuation (Created by author with data from Capital IQ )

Peers

I gathered consensus data for some of the top uranium producers to compare to Cameco's growth and valuation metrics. As can be seen in the table below, quality is scarce in the sector with Kazatomprom's production and geopolitical issues, the rest are junior miners initiating production with substantial execution risk. The more adventurous investor may find Paladin Energy (OTCQX:PALAF) and Boss Energy (OTCQX:BQSSF) an interesting option, judging from consensus data. CGN is a Chinese-listed company.

Created by author with data from Capital IQ & Bloomberg

Risk

The primary risk is a declining uranium price, which may occur if the nuclear reactor expansion stops and even reverses. That scenario seems unlikely given the energy transition, and climate change action to reduce carbon emissions but could be driven by new energy technologies. The other factor that could lead to lower uranium prices in the long term is oversupply as dormant mines and then new mines come into production, i.e., a classic commodity cycle. Cameco´s valuation premium vs Kazatomprom could decline in that scenario.

Conclusion

I rate CCJ a BUY. The company is at the center of the nuclear rebirth that has favorable short and long-term growth expectations that should provide support for uranium prices, if not drive them higher. At the same time, the 49% stake in Westinghouse provides additional integration in the nuclear value chain via the design, construction, and services of nuclear power plants. The combination points to over 30% earnings growth through 2026.

The big question mark on many investors' minds this year has been what will happen with interest rates? When will the Fed decide to lower interest rates, and how will the timing of that decision impact my investments? Back in January, it was starting to look like rate cuts were imminent, and I even wrote an article cautioning against investing in a floating rate senior loan fund at the time, which turned out to be way too early. That article was about the Invesco Senior Income Trust (VVR), and I wrote, When Interest Rates Fall, Time To Bail. I rated VVR a Hold and since that article was published the fund has delivered a total return of 11.35%, nearly matching the S&P 500 change of 12.8%. I had posited at the time that when interest rates start to fall, those senior loans would pay less in interest payments, affecting the NII of the fund.

I still believe that thesis to be true and correct, but the timing of my call was off because the Fed was nowhere near reducing rates back in January. Now that we are about to start the month of July, there is still no indication that rate cuts are imminent, and likely not before September, if then. One fund that I recently came across is a relatively new ETF that offers a hedge against higher for longer interest rates, and it offers a nice return along with portfolio protection against rate risk. The ETF has a rather fancy name of FolioBeyond Alternative Income and Interest Rate Hedge ETF (NYSEARCA:RISR).

This ETF is not what I would consider a buy and hold and never check back on it again, fund. The fund had an inception date of 9/30/21 so it has not yet experienced a time when interest rates were falling. But the fund has performed extremely well since inception and offers a current 7% yield based on holdings of AAA rated investments that include US Treasuries and MBS (mortgage-backed securities).

I like RISR as a portfolio hedge against interest rates that are due to stay higher for longer, and one that offers a nice monthly income stream along with potential price appreciation until rates do eventually get cut. But similar to VVR, I would be looking to sell, or at least downgrade to a Hold and stop adding shares of RISR once the Fed does announce the first interest rate reduction.

RISR is a “Quantamental” Fund

From the fund website describing the fund strategy and positioning:

RISR is a “quantamental”, actively managed, scalable strategy which is positioned as a Diversifier for an existing fixed income portfolio regardless of one’s views on rates Hedge for a fixed income allocation for those concerned about rising rates and who seek to shorten a portfolio’s duration without selling existing positions Means of expressing a directional view for those who seek a vehicle designed to profit from rising rates

In other words, RISR can offer diversification in the fixed income portion of one’s portfolio while providing a hedge against higher interest rates and can leverage the macro view with price appreciation. The fund offers diversification benefits, helps to manage interest rate risk, and generates income under a wide range of interest rate environments.

RISR invests primarily in interest-only mortgage-backed securities (MBS IOs) and U.S. Treasury bonds. MBS IOs are a negative duration security that generally benefit from rising rates. MBS IOs—and Treasuries to a lesser extent —generally provide income under stable rates.

From the fund’s Investment Case document, the uncertainty in the yield curve leads to opportunities for this alternative investment strategy, which I find compelling:

RISR Investment Case

Even if short-term interest rates do fall, this ETF will still generate income from investments in AAA rated securities like Treasuries and MBS. The theory is that lower short-term rates could lead to mortgage buyers prepaying their loans to refinance at lower rates, thereby reducing the amount of interest received. However, in my opinion, that scenario is also likely to lead to increased demand for new mortgages as homebuyers who have been reluctant to take out new mortgages may consider doing so once rates do start to come down, somewhat offsetting that loss in interest payments.

In addition, the long US Treasury position could be increased as short-term rates decline, increasing the positive duration and helping to stabilize the income stream from those holdings. This strategy is further described in the Investment Case document.

RISR Investment Case

This strategy is further described in detail in the Summary Prospectus for the fund:

Conversely, when interest rates are falling, the rate at which borrowers prepay or refinance their mortgages tends to increase. As a result, the income from MBS IOs may decline and the market value of MBS IOs may decrease, which will result in a decline in MBS IO valuations. The Fund’s portfolio is structured such that a potential decline in MBS IO valuations may be partially offset by gains in the Fund’s U.S. Treasury positions, which have a positive duration, as discussed further below. In this scenario, the Fund’s portfolio will likely be rebalanced to bring the overall duration in line with the Duration Target Range, which will generally involve selling the U.S. Treasury positions and increasing the Fund’s holdings of MBS IOs. It should be noted, however, that in the case of MBS IOs, a default by an underlying borrower, will have the same effect as a voluntary prepayment (i.e., it will reduce the balance of the underlying mortgage pool, thereby reducing the market value of the MBS IO, notwithstanding such guarantee).

How Does AI Help?

The fund sponsor behind RISR is called FolioBeyond, LLC. They are a registered investment adviser that was established in 2017. They call themselves a “Quantamental” investor because they combine quantitative and fundamental analysis with a machine learning, artificial intelligence approach to implement the strategy described above. According to the fund’s Investment Pitchbook, the solutions offered include “advanced proprietary algorithms for portfolio construction, asset allocation rebalancing, and stress testing.”

The investment process is diagrammatically outlined in that same Pitchbook document and shows a top-down asset allocation approach followed by a bottom-up security selection process.

RISR Investment Pitchbook

Monthly High Yield Income from AAA Rated Securities

Although the price performance of the fund since inception is very impressive, the steady monthly income that RISR offers is one of the most attractive aspects for me. According to the fund website, the monthly dividend for the past 2 years has amounted to $0.18 per share and a special dividend of $0.5130 was paid in December 2023.

fund website

Fund Performance and Comparison to Other AAA rated ETFs

Although the RISR ETF has only been in existence for less than 3 years, its performance has been impressive in that time. According to the fund website, total return since inception has exceeded 60% and represents an average annual yield of nearly 20%.

fund website

When comparing RISR to other AAA rated funds that offer similar yields of 6% to 7% such as JAAA or CLOA, the difference in performance due to capital appreciation in RISR since its inception is quite remarkable.

Seeking Alpha

And when comparing RISR to a plain vanilla investment grade bond fund such as the Fidelity Investment Grade Bond ETF (FIGB), the relative outperformance just in the past year is still very impressive.

Seeking Alpha

In fact, the SA Quant ratings indicate that RISR is #1 out of 15 in the nontraditional Bond sub-class and #2 out of 444 in the Taxable Bond asset class. The gross expense ratio of 1.13% is the only negative factor, and even that is not terrible for an actively managed ETF that offers a 7.2% dividend yield.

Seeking Alpha

Summary: Buy RISR for Monthly Income and a Portfolio Hedge Against High Interest Rates

As an income investor now in retirement, I am constantly on the lookout for opportunities to collect a high yield income stream, preferably paid on a monthly basis, that has some potential for capital appreciation (or at least avoids loss of capital invested over time). This relatively new ETF from FolioBeyond (using Tidal Investments as fund adviser) checks all those boxes for me and might be of interest to others who are looking for a similar investment. The fund is relatively small with about $61M in AUM and is subject to a number of risks that potential investors should be aware of, including the potential to drop in price once interest rates do get cut.

If you believe like I do that interest rates are likely to remain higher for longer as talks of reductions keep getting pushed farther out, it may be worth buying some shares of RISR now for the monthly income and for some protection in the fixed income portion of your portfolio. With a yield exceeding 7% annually from relatively low risk AAA-rated holdings such as US Treasuries and MBS securities, RISR offers a compelling alternative fixed income investment opportunity.","Torsten AsmusThe big question mark on many investors' minds this year has been what will happen with interest rates?

Welcome to Moats and Monopolies! We do things a little differently here. We not only transparently share our complete portfolio holdings each and every quarter for you to learn along with us, but we write exclusively about companies that we own and therefore have a deeper understanding of. If you are interested in catching up with our investment journey since we started to share on Seeking Alpha one full year ago, you can find links below!

Q2 2023 In this initial share, we discuss our professional background and reasons for sharing publicly the portfolio. Q3 2023 In this update, we go into more detail regarding our investment philosophy, and the portfolio (as well as our pen name) was changed to Moats and Monopolies. FY 2023 In this full-year review, we benchmark ourselves directly against the S&P 500 (spoiler, we beat the market...) as well as ruminate and reflect upon what we've learned this year. Q1 2024 In this update, the MaM beat portfolio each of the three indices against which we benchmark our performance (S&P 500, Nasdaq and MSCI World), and we discussed why we decided to sell fully out of ETFs held to focus on our core holdings.

Investment Philosophy in 100 Words

We are long-only and invest in some of the highest quality companies from around the world. We look for businesses that can compound their revenues over time - ideally with high margins. We prefer companies with low capital expenditures and low debt levels. We look for companies with defensible moats and love to see companies with sustainable, monopolistic parts to their businesses. We have no problem paying for quality and believe that the key isn't valuation but patience - we expect to beat the market by buying better-than-average companies and holding them for longer-than-average periods of time.

Rationale

Following Q1 2024, where we exited out of our ETF holdings to focus on individual stock picks, this quarter was about concentration - ensuring that our invested capital goes into the very best opportunities and our strongest convictions. As everyone on this platform is looking for Alpha, i.e., returns that beat the market, retail investors need to ensure that we have strategies that outperform the average returns of the indices against which we benchmark our returns - typically the S&P 500. In their excellent article 'Hidden Costs of Overdiversification: Understanding using Research on Mutual Funds', Wright Research presented an argument that makes a lot of common sense - the more stocks one owns, the more likely their return is to match the market. Further, in one of the books that has most influenced our investment philosophy: 'Concentrated Investing', Allen C Benello explored the outperformance of fund managers and investors who bucked the commonly held trend of diversification - i.e., not to have one's eggs all in one basket, and instead selected a small number of long-term winners and investing heavily into them.

The most famous example of which is, of course, Warren Buffett who has at most recent check over half of Berkshire's asset portfolio invested in just one company: Apple. We are also big fans of Chris Hohn who runs the Children's Investment Fund and at the time of writing has nearly $40 billion of assets under management into just 10 positions.

Going back to Benello's book. One line of inquiry took him to take random samples of companies from the S&P 500 and then back test portfolio returns assuming each had been equal weighted and held for a duration of 16 years. He found that the best returns (and conversely the lowest) were most likely when investors concentrated into a few holdings. To summarise the findings: The more stocks one owns, the less likely they are to hold a company that suffers existential threat, but conversely the higher the chance that they hold positions that underperform the market. The fewer stocks held, the inverse - the threat of a stock going to zero becomes a bigger risk as a percentage of a portfolio, but there are fewer positions that could potentially underperform.

As a crude analogy, think about a trip to the casino. The biggest winner or loser in the building will be that guy whose rock up to the roulette table and goes all in on black on the 1st spin. Either doubling his money or losing everything. On the other extreme, there will be those who bring their money and drip it slowly across a variety of games over the entire evening. They are much less likely to lose everything, but unlikely to go home with a life changing some of the money.

Concentrated Investing: Strategies of the World's Greatest Concentrated Value Investors by Allen C. Benello (Published by Wiley & Sons)

The trick to this strategy is then to have a limited number of holdings, but crucially to ensure there is no existential risk by keeping close track of them. Further, as quality investors, we look for companies with strong competitive advantages, low levels of debt and consistent and compounding revenues. Our logic is that if we hold the best quality companies, no matter what the price, for long enough, they will outperform the average of the rest of those available on the public markets.

However, the other side of this is the ability to rest well at nighttime without worrying about a large percentage of your net worth being in such a small number of holdings. There is always a sweet spot on the investment risk/reward spectrum at which we all feel at ease, and for the MaM portfolio, that sweet spot is 20 holdings, yours may be different - and that's absolutely fine! For us, around 5% in a particular holding feels enough of a weighting of invested capital. Should a particular company outperform others in the portfolio and grow to a much larger position than 5%, then our philosophy is to let it run - the old adage 'trim the weeds, water the flowers' is a simple mantra to which we adhere.

With that in mind, we used a series of quantitative and qualitative calculations and created a 'league table' of our convictions with scores for each of our holdings. We had already decided to 'relegate' or sell completely out of any companies to get us down to our target of 20 holdings, and then created target weightings accordingly. That led to us selling out of Starbucks (SBUX), The Home Depot (HD), LVMH (OTCPK:LVMHF) and Canadian Pacific (CP). Starbucks was particularly painful, as we had just bought it before the disastrous earnings report that led it to slide 15%. Note the smaller position in Beauty Health Company (SKIN) is not included as it is much more speculative than the rest of our holdings, and we have a clear target price at which we would sell out of the holding, whilst the others in the portfolio are hopefully going to be held for years to come. The table can be seen below:

The MaM Portfolio holdings with target allocations and scores for 'conviction' (Author's own work)

Adobe (ADBE) was sold at a price of $473.67, following concerns mentioned in our most recent portfolio update, in which we explained how as we buy expensive companies that will grow into their valuations, we need to be confident about their competitive advantages (i.e. their moat or their monopoly) in order to be sure that they can compound their value uninterrupted over a long enough period of time to rationalise the price we pay. We had concerns over Adobe, and it was unclear whether they would be victors or victims of AI, particularly with the ease with which one can generate images using new upstarts that have entered the market very recently. The stock has (naturally) raced up since we sold; however, we are fully aware of our inability to predict the future nor market time and feel comfortable that despite missing out on the ascent, funds have been reallocated effectively.

The rest of the changes reflect the natural rebalancing of reducing the portfolio holdings to 21 from 25, in addition to opportunistic purchases of MSCI, Pool Corp and Salesforce after post earnings/guidance dips.

In these charts, we can see the impact of selling out of some lower margin businesses, such as Starbucks and Home Depot, has had on the overall weighted margins of the MaM portfolio. We hold many companies that have extraordinarily high gross margins due to their asset-light business models, such as the payment processors, software companies and credit agencies. Our current weighted free cash flow margin is hovering around 30%, showing the high quality and profitability of our holdings.

The weighted cost of capital is still creeping higher, and we read this as a further lagging indicator of the trickle-down effects of inflation and interest rate increases on our holdings; however, the returns on that capital are increasing - particularly with those companies that have recently undertaken large acquisitions: S&P Global (SPGI), Moody's (MCO) and Linde (LIN). Further, the improved profitability of our ecommerce companies Amazon (AMZN) and MercardoLibre (MELI) have contributed well this quarter.

We can also see that despite the portfolio's very high valuation, the weighted PE is coming down as the free cash flow yield on cost increases. Our growth model suggests that the weighted PE will drop to 15 by 2030 and the FCF yield should hit 10% a decade out from here. This may still sound very expensive to many of you (and that's completely OK!); however, as you can see from our final chart, we are paying for the fast growth of the companies we hold and the growing market opportunities that are available to them. We are investing in what we see as important macro trends for the near future: ecommerce, robotic surgical assistants, cloud infrastructure, semiconductor makers and designers, software companies and digital payment processors in the continuous 'war against cash'. Further, we also hold what we consider to be dependable companies that will be difficult to innovate away such as Linde, (industrial gases), Pool Corp (swimming pool distributors/retailers) and Costco (basic staples). We are confident that we have picked winners that can continue to grow relatively unchallenged, and thus will grow into their lofty valuations. Time will tell, of course.

Benchmarking

How $10k would have grown since beginning our portfolio share on Seeking Alpha vs major indices (Author's own work)

Whilst most of you reading this article will benchmark your performance against the S&P 500, we choose to use three indices - the MSCI World (our portfolio is around 1/5 international stocks), the S&P 500 and the Nasdaq 100, due to our high exposure to technology stocks. The line graph above shows what would have happened had one invested $10k into the MaM portfolio as well as the aforementioned indices at the time at which we began to share our holdings. As you can see, we have been comfortably beating the market so far; however, the timescale is so small as to make it quite insignificant - we are overweight technology, and we may well be experiencing a little AI overexcitement in valuations at the moment, leading our portfolio and the Nasdaq to race ahead of an already bullish market over the past handful of quarters.

We have decided to start to show how each of our holdings is doing on a quarterly basis as well as how our portfolio and benchmark indices are performing, and an addition to our regular portfolio updates. Please note that all of the calculations, charts and tables throughout the article are methodically done by hand using Google Sheets, Seeking Alpha, Guru Focus and where necessary company 10Ks and 10Qs or international equivalent where we have data missing. Further, it is part way through the 28th June as we write this, so the data doesn't include the 2nd half of today's trading. So please take each of these numbers with a grain of salt, but it gives us a reference point for contributors and detractors for our portfolio. Finally, they are based purely on the difference in stock prices between points around about the end of each quarter. Finally, we may have added to positions during a quarter at a variety of cost prices, so our returns on individual holdings may not match what is below.

Final Words

Thank you, as always, for those of you who follow the Moats and Monopolies portfolio. We do not intend to make any major additions or changes in the upcoming couple of quarters, but hope to be able to use some extra summer vacation time to finally get back to writing articles again (there's a toddler in the house, which takes time away from the keyboard.) On the mind at the moment is a write-up on Pool Corp, so look out for that soon!

Looking forward to discussing both our portfolio and investing in general below the line. Thank you in advance for respectful and constructive comments.

Investment Thesis

Micron's (NASDAQ:MU) stock triggered a 7% pullback despite a better-than-expected Q3 FY2024 earnings result. Its Q4 FY2024 guidance also topped the market consensus. Given the strong rally this year, the post-earnings selloff might be driven by consolidation or concern about a significant increase in capex impacting its FCF in FY2025. Nevertheless, MU's top-line growth trajectory has significantly reaccelerated since early this year, driven by price hikes and strong demand for high-margin AI-related products, including High Bandwidth Memory (HBM), high-capacity DIMMs, and data center SSDs.

In my previous article, I issued a sell rating, due to a 50% revenue decline amid premium valuation. However, over the past 12 months, there has been a tremendous shift in the growth story for NAND and DRAM. Due to the stock pullback, I upgraded MU to a buy, as the stock is now trading at 14.7x non-GAAP P/E FY2025 based on Bloomberg EPS consensus.

3Q FY2024 Takeaway

The company model

MU beat revenue estimates in Q3 FY2024, largely driven by 50% QoQ growth in its Storage Business Unit. However, investors might be disappointed that its Q4 FY2024 revenue guidance was only 0.26% above the estimate. Let's look at the chart above. Despite a nearly 50% YoY revenue decline in FY2023, the company's top-line growth has significantly reaccelerated since Q1 FY2024, accelerating over the past four quarters.

The midpoint of the Q4 FY2024 revenue guidance implies an 89.5% YoY growth, which is even higher than the previous quarter. I believe that the significant growth rebound justifies the recent price action and multiple expansions for the stock. Given the strong growth momentum, it's possible that this selloff might imply that buyside consensus is even higher, and the muted 4Q revenue outlook might disappoint some investors as well. However, it's clear that MU's future growth trajectory will trend significantly higher due to AI-driven opportunities.

The company model

Now let's look at the company's margins. We can see that MU has significantly improved its gross margin, which is another positive signal. Typically, in the early stages, a growth company will prioritize top-line growth to maintain market share at the expense of margin expansion. While its non-GAAP gross margin is still below the 40% threshold that we've seen back in FY2022, it's encouraging to see that a guided 34.5% non-GAAP gross margin in 4Q FY2024. I believe the gross margin will continue to expand towards previous highs in FY2025 due to price hikes on AI-related products.

With an expected 60.5% YoY revenue growth in FY2024 and significant margin expansion, we expect a massive rebound in earnings growth. The company not only beat non-GAAP EPS in Q3 FY2024 but also topped market consensus for Q4 FY2024. It's also a positive sign that its non-GAAP EPS is in positive territory and poised to trend significantly higher in the coming quarters.

Wall Street Is Bullish on MU's Growth Outlook

Although the management did not provide a FY2025 outlook, the street has significantly boosted its revenue and earnings revisions over the past few months. In the earnings call, the management indicated that the AI boom would drive significant growth in the demand for DRAM and NAND. They highlighted that the HBM3E solution boasts 30% lower power consumption than peers. Additionally, they also mentioned that HBM is sold out for 2024 and 2025, which will generate multiple billions of dollars in revenue in FY2025, up from several hundred million dollars in FY2024. With volume and pricing locked in for the next year, the street is bullish on the company's growth outlook. Currently, sell-side analysts on Bloomberg expect average growth in its non-GAAP EPS for FY2025 to reach $9.04 per share, implying a 672.6% YoY growth. While the stock is currently trading at a lofty P/E TTM, I believe its P/E forward will significantly come down and look attractive if we factor in its FY2025 earnings consensus.

Growing Capex Will Impact FCF

The management indicates that MU's FY2024 capex plan will be around $8 billion. We can estimate that Q4 FY2024 capex will be $2.7 billion, an 87% YoY boost compared to Q4 FY2023. Q4 capex is expected to be 36% of total revenue, up from 30.6% in Q3 FY2024. Management also expects to increase capex materially in FY2025, with capex around the mid-30% range of revenue. In the earnings call, they indicated that this would support HBM assembly and test equipment, fab and back-end facility construction, and technology transition investment to maintain demand growth. However, I believe the post-earnings selloff is partially driven by this announcement, as it will significantly impact FCF in the near term.

Valuation

Seeking Alpha

As I mentioned in my last analysis, the stock was approaching an all-time high EV/Sales TTM back in June 2023, even as its revenue suffered from a 50% YoY decline. However, I mentioned that ""when the stock price decreases, the valuation multiple becomes more expensive."" But we can expect MU's growth outlook to be significantly higher in FY2025.

Seeking Alpha

Despite an 88.3% expansion in its multiple from 4x in my previous coverage to 7.53x now, its EV/Sales FY2025E is expected to decrease to 4.26x, according to Seeking Alpha's FY2025 revenue growth estimate of 50.75% YoY. Therefore, the stock is not trading at a lofty valuation.

In addition, if we factor in the Q4 FY2024 non-GAAP EPS guidance of $1.08, we can estimate the stock's P/E FY2024 to be 113x, which is incredibly high. However, the company is expected to generate 672.6% YoY non-GAAP EPS growth in FY2025. This will make its non-GAAP P/E FY2025 to be 14.7x, significantly below the S&P 500's P/E FY2025 of 19.6x. Therefore, I believe MU is currently undervalued and still has room for further upside. The last week's selloff created a buying opportunity.

Conclusion

In summary, MU's strong Q3 FY2024 earnings result, driven by substantial demand for NAND and DRAM and better-than-expected guidance for Q4, highlights its resilience and massive growth potential amidst the current AI boom. Despite a recent 7% stock pullback, likely due to consolidation and increased capex impacting near-term FCF, the company's significant revenue and margin expansions signal a growth rebound story in the long run, which deserves a higher valuation. With non-GAAP EPS back in positive territory and expected to jump nearly sevenfold in FY2025, MU's non-GAAP P/E FY2025 appears extremely undervalued and poised for further upside. Therefore, I upgraded the stock to buy.","Due to the stock pullback, I upgraded MU to a buy, as the stock is now trading at 14.7x non-GAAP P/E FY2025 based on Bloomberg EPS consensus.

I am finally warming up again to Okta (NASDAQ:OKTA) after a brief period on the sidelines. The cybersecurity company is showing real signs of accelerating growth rates, yet the fundamental momentum is not being reflected in the stock price or valuation. The company has a net cash balance sheet, is generating positive cash flow, and appears within striking distance of GAAP profitability. There is still some uncertainty regarding competitive threats given the perceived commoditized nature of the product, but thus far these fears have remained just that. Management continues to guide conservatively, but I am gaining confidence that they may be able to return to a “beat and raise” cadence moving forward. I am upgrading the stock to buy.

OKTA Stock Price

I last covered OKTA in April, where I reiterated my neutral rating given my low confidence in the company’s growth prospects against its then-valuation. The stock has underperformed the broader markets since then, but the company’s latest results indicate that my hesitance may have been misplaced.

Data by YCharts

Given the company’s strong balance sheet and solid profitability, the valuation looks attractive at these levels, even if the growth story isn’t as clear-cut as typical cybersecurity names.

OKTA Stock Key Metrics

OKTA is an enterprise tech company in the cybersecurity sector, offering identity and access management products. An easy way to think about their products is like “two-factor authentication” for enterprises, to secure all apps made available for employees.

FY25 Q1 Presentation

In its most recent quarter, OKTA delivered 19% YoY revenue growth, surpassing guidance for 17% growth.

FY25 Q1 Presentation

OKTA saw current remaining performance obligations grow 15% YoY to $1.949 billion, surpassing guidance for 13% growth. That strong result may indicate that revenue growth should remain in the double-digits at least in the near term.

FY25 Q1 Presentation

OKTA reported an 111% trailing twelve months dollar-based net retention rate, representing stabilization from the fourth quarter. I view this to be a solid result given that many tech names have seen pressure to customer headcount growth amidst the higher interest rate environment and the rise of generative AI.

FY25 Q1 Presentation

On the profitability front, OKTA generated a 21.6% non-GAAP operating margin, crushing guidance for 18%. Notably, the $47 million GAAP operating loss was a large improvement compared to prior quarters and shows clearly how close the company is getting to GAAP profitability.

FY25 Q1 Presentation

OKTA ended the quarter with $2.3 billion of cash versus $1.2 billion of debt, representing a strong net cash balance sheet.

Looking ahead, management has guided for the second quarter to see up to 14% revenue growth and 11% cRPO growth. Consensus estimates call for $633 million in revenues.

FY25 Q1 Presentation

For the full year, management raised revenue guidance only slightly from 11% up to 12%. Given the size of the beat in this past quarter, it is clear that there is a great deal of conservatism baked into that target.

FY25 Q1 Presentation

On the conference call, management noted that their cautious guidance is due to them still assessing the impact from their October security incident. Yet even if growth does end up slowing at some point, management appeared to remain optimistic about long-term prospects, stating that they “are not here to be a slow growth company” and are still aiming to accelerate growth rates. Management noted that they did see some of the headcount pressures facing other software peers but noted that they have been able to offset declining seat count with new products. It is possible that OKTA, like other headcount-based software peers, may eventually see a macro-related boost to growth rates as their customers return to historical hiring patterns.

Is OKTA Stock A Buy, Sell, or Hold?

OKTA is one of the stocks that investors have seemingly labeled as being in the crosshairs of the “software death star” in Microsoft (MSFT), but based on the company’s assessment as well as a cursory glance of user reviews, OKTA still appears to be offering a stronger product.

FY25 Q1 Presentation

I am of the view that Wall Street is missing the big picture here. OKTA has a recurring revenue base backed by a net cash balance sheet and positive free cash flow generation. The company may be able to achieve GAAP profitability within 1 to 2 years if management allows operating leverage to take hold. I can see the company sustaining at least 35% net margins over the long term but will use 30% for modeling purposes. Yet, the stock recently traded hands at just around 6x sales.

Seeking Alpha

That implies a 20x long-term earnings multiple, which looks too low given the projected double-digit forward revenue growth rate and aforementioned strong balance sheet. I can see the stock eventually re-rating to the 8x sales range, equating to around 26.6x long-term earnings. Between the double-digit growth rate and multiple expansion potential, I can see OKTA beating the market from here over the long term.

OKTA Stock Risks

It is possible that the October security incident (along with the numerous others) just have not yet impacted the financials as of yet. Perhaps there are some large renewals coming up that may not go as smoothly as planned. Perhaps MSFT is able to take increasing market share and pressure the growth rate. OKTA is not yet GAAP profitable, and thus the stock might exhibit great volatility under poor market conditions.

OKTA Stock Conclusion

OKTA is not growing as fast nor as profitable as more famous cybersecurity peers like CrowdStrike (CRWD), but the stock looks attractive in its own right. For one, the stock trades at much lower multiples on a price to sales basis and the company still has a net cash balance sheet and non-GAAP profitability. I can see the stock delivering solid double-digit returns from here, especially if revenue growth can eventually accelerate. I am upgrading the stock to buy.","The company has a net cash balance sheet, is generating positive cash flow, and appears within striking distance of GAAP profitability.

Seeking Alpha,https://seekingalpha.com/article/4701755-kinsale-capital-stock-excess-and-surplus-insurer-for-excess-and-surplus-profits?source=feed_all_articles,2024-07-01,02:10:21 UTC,Kinsale Capital (KNSL): An Excess And Surplus Insurer For Excess And Surplus Profits,"The best photo for all

Introduction

Since the last time I reviewed Kinsale Capital, shares of the company have fallen over 22%. I felt that Kinsale had a strong growth trajectory in the excess & surplus insurance market and a strong competitive advantage in providing faster quotes with technology-enabled processes. In this article, I’ll provide an update to my original investment thesis, dissect the latest quarterly results, and share my thoughts on the outlook and valuation.

Company Overview

Kinsale Capital Group, Inc. (NYSE:KNSL) is a specialty insurance company. What makes Kinsale unique is that it exclusively targets the excess and surplus (E&S) market, which is the fastest part of the insurance market. Based out of Virginia, Kinsale was founded in 2009 by the current Chairman and CEO, Michael Kehoe, who had previously served as the President and CEO of James River Group Holdings (JRVR). Specializing in hard-to-place commercial property & casualty insurance for small- to -medium-sized businesses, a significant portion of Kinsale’s business is in commercial lines, including Commercial Property, Excess Casualty, and Small Business Casualty.

Investor Presentation

Investment Thesis

Positioned as a leader in the E&S market, I think Kinsale is poised to benefit from long-term secular tailwinds. As a market that’s often underserved by traditional insurance, E&S continues to get a large inflow of business from standard companies and rate driven by inflation and relatively tight underwriting conditions. Among the subsegments of the insurance industry, E&S is relatively exciting because it’s still in its early stages. Growth at Kinsale will continue to benefit from more underwriting in the E&S market as a whole, but Kinsale in particular will benefit given its tech-driven service and product expansion. With faster turnaround times relative to peers and 14 new underwriting divisions in recent years (bringing Kinsale to 25 divisions today) Kinsale should continue to maintain its market leading position.

I think Kinsale’s industry-leading underwriting performance is likely to continue. As I’ll discuss later, the company has some of the best returns on equity and combined ratios for insurance. I think strong results like the recent results are replicable going forward, and the company’s favorable reserve development reflects diligence on general liability. There’re very few insurance companies who are able to do what Kinsale has done. The only insurance companies to my knowledge that have better combined ratios are AMERISAFE (AMSF) and International General Insurance (IGIC), a company I previously covered in February.

Investor Presentation

Finally, Kinsale’s focus and technological advantage are a source of moat. Kinsale’s expense ratio is very low (at 20.8% in 2023, according to S&P Capital IQ), which is supported by a centralized structure and proprietary technology. In an interview with Ron Baron, Kinsale discussed how its IT systems are built in-house, eliminating constraints on adding new product lines or features that reduce labor for underwriters. For most new business submissions, this helps Kinsale to swiftly issue quotes where fast turnaround times and responsiveness builds goodwill with brokers and allows KNSL to pay lower commissions, as brokers are willing to trade commissions for service and specialization in hard-to-place risks. It also means that Kinsale can charge a small premium because it underwrites faster.

Investor Presentation

Operating in a rapidly growing segment of the insurance market, Kinsale has been benefitting from strong tailwinds. Over the last ten years, the company has produced a 38.1% CAGR on the top line and 40.7% on the bottom line (EBITDA). In the last five years, the company has shown no signs of slowing down, growing revenues and EBITDA at CAGRs of 40.7% and 57.4%, respectively (source: S&P Capital IQ).

Author, based on data from S&P Capital IQ

Recent Results

When looking at the most recent results for Kinsale, the company reported earnings per share of $4.24, which was 76.7% higher than Q1’23. Gross written premiums increased by 25.5% to $448.6 million, and underwriting income was up 79.5%.

Overall, these were very impressive results. Not only does Kinsale continue to put up strong top line growth, but the company’s profitability has also rapidly improved.

We see that reflected in the company’s combined ratio and ROE metrics too. At the end of the quarter, the company had combined ratio of 79.5%, and it posted an operating return on equity of 28.9%. On the expense ratio, the company saw a decline from 21.7% last year to 20.7% this quarter. Most of this was driven by the benefit of higher ceding commissions from the Company's casualty and commercial property proportional reinsurance agreements as a result of growth in the lines of business ceded into those treaties. This is sustainable, in my view, given that brokers are willing to trade commissions for volume for business with Kinsale.

Company Filings

On the earnings call, management noted that the growth in gross written premium of growth of 25.5% from 33.8% in the Q4’23 highlights a deceleration in growth rate from the 40% growth we've experienced over the last several years. This deceleration is mostly attributable by a return to a more normal level in competition.

In P&C, property is an exciting area of growth for Kinsale because of its high growth rates and strong pricing. In casualty, challenges with respect to the frequency and severity of inflation, rising loss cost, and an unpredictable legal system make for a market that provides Kinsale a long-term growth opportunity.

In terms of my outlook for Kinsale, I would continue to expect strong profitability ratios. Where I do see cause for concern is the deceleration in premium growth. As Kinsale gets larger and the market matures, I foresee premium growth settling towards a long-term run rate in the mid-teens. In the past, management has said that it believes that Kinsale can grow 10-20% through the cycle. Although I think that market conditions should eventually normalize, a potential uptick in casualty pricing (due to reserving issues facing by the industry) could prolong an already extended market and be beneficial for Kinsale.

Another element in Kinsale’s financial profile to consider is how management will begin trading off growth and margins in a more normal market (i.e., more growth for lower margins resulting in higher underwriting income dollars) given the company’s meaningful expense advantage (8-9 combined ratio points). In the current hard market, Kinsale has been somewhat of a price taker and has experienced both outsized growth and margins.

Valuation

Based on the 10 sellside analysts covering the stock, there are 2 ‘buy’ ratings and 8 ‘hold’ ratings. From current price to the average price target of $418.38 one year out, this implies about 11.0% upside, not including the current dividend yield of 0.2%.

Seeking Alpha

Kinsale trades for 25.6x P/E and 20.3x EV/EBITDA (source: S&P Capital IQ). While these might seem expensive on an absolute basis, keep in mind that Kinsale has been growing in excess of 20% on a compounded basis. For example, when using the forward multiples of 21.9x 2025 earnings and 18.4x 2026 earnings, the valuation seems much more reasonable when considering the company’s future earnings growth, in spite of a deceleration.

Historically, management hasn't offered up guidance targets or growth forecasts. I find the 21.9x 2025 earnings and 18.4x 2026 earnings reasonable valuation multiples to use given the growth rate of the E&S market. According to a report from Allied Market Research, the E&S market is expected to grow at a rate of 15.2% from 2020 to 2027. This roughly in line with consensus revenue forecasts in 2025 and 2026 of 20.3% and 11.6%, so it seems that Kinsale should be able to grow with the industry (source: Bloomberg). This also helps to get over the current valuation multiple of 25.6x P/E, knowing that earnings are growing rapidly.

Compared to its historical valuation, Kinsale is trading at one of the lowest valuations it's ever traded at. Historically, the company has traded at an average multiple of 30.3x EV/EBITDA. While the company may have been overpriced before, I think the recent pullback has given investors an opportunity to get long this compounder. At the current multiple of 20.3x, Kinsale offers up a strong discount to its ten-year average multiple, especially when we consider that this is a business that's essentially been doubling in size every 2 years.

Author, based on data from S&P Capital IQ

In terms of the risks to the investment thesis, there are a few that investors should monitor, both macro and company specific. Firstly, there is a risk that the E&S market doesn't grow as fast as expected (15.2% per year). This could come from the general insurance market slowing down. During the pandemic, insurance companies had become ""essential businesses"" where insurance was needed for coverage of business interruption or incidents related to physical loss (e.g., forced closedown due to physical damage). I view the growth rate of E&S to be more secular rather than event-driven by the pandemic, particularly as Kinsale had been growing 20%+ even before 2019.

Specific to Kinsale, there's also a risk that new entrants into the market. For example, Kinsale enjoys a dominant market position in the E&S market and there's always a risk that new entrants put pressure on profitability ratios. If new competition goes head-to-head with Kinsale, the company would be forced to reduce premiums to remain competitive. While the company has superior technology, faster turnaround times, and a first-mover advantage as being the leader in the space, where there's money to be made, we can be sure that competition will eventually come to Kinsale. For now, I think the moat is very durable and even if the company can grow with the industry, the forward returns look quite attractive.

Conclusion

On this recent share price drop, I’m adding to my position in Kinsale Capital. Over the company’s relatively short life as a public company, Kinsale has grown from its founding in 2009 to a billion-dollar insurance company. Still, the company only has a 1% market share. With a track record of demonstrating remarkable business performance, I believe the share price decline has provided investors a gift to pick up shares of this compounder.

As we’ve discussed, Kinsale has clear competitive advantages that will make it a winner. With faster quotes compared to peers, a defensible moat with respect to its technology, and the ability to charge higher premiums, Kinsale is tapping into unmet needs in the E&S market. By focusing on smaller insurance premiums and diversifying risk across several industries, I think Kinsale offers up a compelling opportunity that offers elements of both growth and value. If the high multiple scares you, keep in mind that this business is doubling in size every couple of years. For investors who can get over this hurdle and can see a path to long-term growth, an investment in Kinsale makes sense.","The best photo for allIntroductionSince the last time I reviewed Kinsale Capital, shares of the company have fallen over 22%.
I felt that Kinsale had a strong growth trajectory in the excess & surplus insurance market and a strong competitive advantage in providing faster quotes with technology-enabled processes.
What makes Kinsale unique is that it exclusively targets the excess and surplus (E&S) market, which is the fastest part of the insurance market.

Arm Holdings (NASDAQ:ARM) is reaching a major paradigm shift in their target market as the firm further develops their CSS architecture. ARM has recently made a few major announcements involving the adoption of their ARM Neoverse across the hyperscalers, including Microsoft (MSFT), Oracle (ORCL), and Amazon (AMZN). As each of these firms further develop their high-performance processors to bolster the speed, reliability, and power reduction, I believe ARM will realize a significant growth opportunity that will take the firm well beyond their smartphone-entrenched market. I am upgrading my recommendation for ARM shares to a BUY rating with a price target of $213.78/share at 54.43x eFY26 price/sales.

Arm Will Have A Tough First Year Back In The Public Arena

Arm's Share Price Has Gotten Ahead Of Operating Growth

ARM Operations

ARM is positioning itself for significant growth in the coming years as “AI everything” starts to take form. Though I believe AI-enabled smartphones and AI-enabled PCs are going to experience a slow adoption in the next two years, CY24/CY25, I do anticipate adoption to begin taking hold as consumers begin upgrading and migrating to the latest devices. To make my thesis clear with respect to this theme, I do not anticipate consumers to upgrade their devices in mass for the sake of upgrading. I believe upgrades will be driven by the necessity to refresh hardware as opposed to seeking out the newest device. Despite my anticipation for a relatively flat consumer device market going into CY25, I do believe there is some value to be extracted within the segment as OEMs migrate from ARMv8 to ARMv9. As adoption accelerates to ARMv9, royalty revenue will follow as more CPUs fit inside the chip. This factor will drive significant value across both the top-line and bottom-line as these higher-powered chips will likely be very margin accretive. ARMv9 is expected to be utilized across multiple verticals, including automotive ADAS, handheld devices, and industrial IoT for enhanced automation, amongst others. Management expects ARMv9 adoption and CSS chips to start ramping up in e2h25.

Bright Spot For ARM Architecture

Though I anticipate a relatively lackluster year for handheld devices, PCs, and automotive sales, there are some bright spots for ARM in the back-half of eFY25 and beyond. As discussed in my initial coverage of Nvidia, Nvidia Doesn't Need China For Growth In AI Chips, the hyperscalers were in the process of designing their own chipsets for AI factory purposes. These chips are beginning to come to fruition and are broadly adopting ARM architecture for its power efficiency, data retrieval, and integration. I believe this shift away from the x86 architecture into ARM architecture can drive significant growth beyond ARM’s smartphone business in the coming years and will significantly shift the next generation of compute. Though this wasn’t a part of my core thesis for Intel (INTC), a shift to ARM architecture may create a major headwind for their x86 business.

One point that stuck out to me in the q4’24 earnings call was that management is seeking an avenue to enter into infrastructure and take some of the highly sought-after market share from the x86 server chip. On the call, management discussed how the ARM CPU and the NVIDIA (NVDA) GPU on the Grace Blackwell can integrate and allow for higher access to memory bandwidth when compared to the x86. This can be a major shift in server hardware if ARM architecture is utilized in the next generation of AI-enabled infrastructure and has the ability to bring ARM significant growth, if adopted. Though I believe this may be a long-shot expectation as this shift would be the biggest since the separation of hardware and software with the introduction of the x86, it can very well occur as AI factories are somewhat more standalone vs. traditional general compute server farms. I personally wouldn’t bet the farm on this shift to occur; however, if ARM CPUs are adopted in server hardware, I expect this to first occur across hyperscalers before going into enterprise data centers.

ARM announced their partnership with Microsoft in November 2023 to develop the Neoverse CSS that can create more custom, specialized solutions for AI infrastructure and networking devices. Management mentioned in the q4’24 earnings call that their first Neoverse/Microsoft (MSFT) Cobalt chip is now ramping up. This is likely to bleed into Oracle’s (ORCL) AI factories being built out as the firm seeks to take on market share. Oracle is currently working on accelerating the ARM developer ecosystem to transition applications from x86 to ARM architecture. As management at ARM described the CPU+GPU model with Grace Hopper and Grace Blackwell, Oracle will likely be leveraging this model to accelerate AI and HPC applications.

ARM also announced their partnership with Google (GOOGL, GOOG) for their Axion processor. Google announced that the Axion Processors will be available for GCP customers in late CY24 and will provide faster data retrieval, faster video distribution, and GenAI. These chips will provide for better energy efficiency across Google’s AI factories. Google expects 30% better performance than the fastest general-purpose Arm-based instance with up to 50% better performance and up to 60% better energy-efficiency when compared to the current generation x86-based instance.

ARM Financials

Corporate Reports

Forecasting financials for ARM, I anticipate the firm to begin realizing tailwinds in growth and margin expansion in e2h25 and into eFY26. Given the early ramp of the ARM Neoverse, I do not expect this form factor to be accretive to growth until eFY26, as the ramp up with Microsoft isn’t likely to occur until eFY2h25. I believe this will be the catalyst that will drive ARM to the next level of growth and profitability. In the meantime, I anticipate a relatively flat outcome as a result of the soft smartphone and automotive market, net of new adoption in automotive ADAS.

Valuation & Shareholder Value

Corporate Reports

One of the biggest challenges ARM faces is their valuation. Shares are currently trading at 53x price/sales, a relatively high valuation for the industry. As a value investor, I believe this premium makes the shares un-investable as shares are priced for perfection.

Seeking Alpha

As a growth investor, I believe ARM shares will realize significant upside given the adoption of ARM Neoverse across the hyperscalers. To add some perspective, Oracle is constructing massive 200MW AI factories and a 1GW AI factory. Given the relationship with ARM, I believe that Oracle will likely utilize ARM CPUs paired with Nvidia’s GPUs to accelerate performance.

Corporate Reports

Given these growth factors, I am upgrading my recommendation for ARM to a BUY rating with a price target of $213.78/share at 54.43x eFY26 price/sales.

Additional Risks to Consider

There are some risks to take into consideration as we navigate through my investment thesis. To state the obvious first, ARM currently has a very rich valuation, and any minor setbacks can result in a significant decline in the share price. Another risk to consider is that Neoverse may not be as broadly adopted as laid out in my thesis, as this would require significant software upgrades to migrate from the x86 to ARM architecture. In addition to this risk, my expectation is for Neoverse to begin impacting the top-line towards the end of eFY25 and more prominently in eFY26. ARM will likely need to bridge the growth gap with stronger handheld sales in order to maintain their premium valuation before Neoverse ramps up. Any one of these events may lead to my gray-sky scenario and send shares down -34%.","ARM has recently made a few major announcements involving the adoption of their ARM Neoverse across the hyperscalers, including Microsoft (MSFT), Oracle (ORCL), and Amazon (AMZN).

Seeking Alpha,https://seekingalpha.com/article/4701746-portillos-ptlo-buy-the-stock?source=feed_all_articles,2024-06-30,19:05:47 UTC,Portillo's: Buying The Beef And The Stock (NASDAQ:PTLO),"bhofack2

Portillo's (NASDAQ:PTLO) shares have fallen 40% year-to-date and are now off 55% over the past year. Investors have fled the stock following a disappointing first quarter earnings report, concern over consumer spending, and persistent selling by private equity firm Berkshire Partners (not affiliated with Berkshire Hathaway) since the IPO.

While 1Q numbers weren't great, at today's price, I see little fundamental downside in Portillo's shares (discussed below) and think investors are overlooking some important positives, notably:

Loyal core customer base in Chicagoland which provides some competitive insulation should price competition increase

Operational improvements from kitchen reconfiguration & opportunities to reduce front of store costs through kiosks

Continued restaurant expansion opportunity in sunbelt markets - new restaurant footprints have been optimized to improve returns on capital

Approaching end of private equity overhang as Berkshire Partners is now down below 20% ownership (versus 60+% at IPO).

While I was negative on Portillo's in late 2022 (with the stock at 20) and neutral earlier this year at 14, below $10 per share I am a buyer of the stock (and the delicious Italian beef sandwiches). I see the potential for 60% near-term upside and 130% upside (32% annualized) looking out to 2027.

Recent Results & Near-term Outlook

Portillo's 1Q24 Same-Store Sales (Investor Presentation)

As shown above, same-restaurant sales in 1Q24 were slightly negative as positive pricing was more than offset by comparable transactions which declined 3.2% in the quarter. While results were disappointing it should be noted that Portillo's is not alone as several restaurant chains reported soft results their most recent quarter, including Starbucks (SBUX) which saw -7% traffic and -3% same-store sales and Wall Street darling Cava (CAVA) which had -1.2% traffic decline contributing to a softer than expected 2.3% same store revenue growth. Similarly, Darden's (DRI) largest chain Olive Garden also saw both negative comparable sales (-1.6%) and transactions (-2.6%). Nearly all restaurants are facing pressure as consumers tighten their belts due to years of inflationary pressure constraining household budgets and we are likely to see continued softness in near-term results.

For the foreseeable future, Portillo's will be at a bit of a disadvantage versus restaurant peers when it comes to transaction/ same store comps because 55% of Portillo's locations (and 70% of revenue) are based in Illinois which has a declining population. Overall, I expect -1 to 0% same-store transaction growth for the next couple of years (and 0-3% same-store revenue growth) until more sunbelt locations enter the comp base and bolster transactions.

Having said that, Portillo's has done a reasonable job managing profitability in a tough environment with restaurant level EBITDA margins declining just 0.4% year-over-year and overall EBITDA margins increasing. Moreover, as described below, there are operational improvement opportunities which should help preserve margins even in a tough environment for comps.

Opportunities for improvement

Production Line Efficiency (2023 Investor Day Presentation)

Portillo's has large restaurants, a broad menu, and a fair amount of operational complexity. Historically it has had an unnecessarily long 'production line' (100+ feet in some locations) which both increased capital and operating costs (lower unit throughput per employee) and slowed service. The company is not only addressing this with smaller and more efficient new store builds (47-65 foot production lines and $1 million reduction in capital costs) but is retrofitting many existing restaurants to improve efficiency and throughput.

Trialing Ordering Kiosks (1Q24 earnings transcript from Seeking Alpha)

I see the introduction of ordering kiosks as a notable potential positive for Portillo's. Benefits here are numerous and include: lower labor costs, improved order accuracy, and faster service time. The company is trialing kiosks in its California locations and I am hopeful that these will be rolled out to all locations over the next couple years.

It is also important to highlight that Portillo's has made significant improvements to the process by which it opens new restaurants. The company went through growth pains from 2015-2021 as it didn't have the infrastructure (dedicated new store opening teams) to properly open restaurants and had many hiccups along the way (incredibly long lines, poorly trained employees and in some cases 90 minute waits!). With scale Portillo's has been able to invest in new restaurant opening teams which has greatly improved the opening process and improved both customer and employee satisfaction.

Valuation

At $9.72 per share, after factoring in its debt, Portillo's has an enterprise value of just over $1 billion which is roughly the price at which Berkshire took it private in 2014 (when it had just 40 locations versus 86 today).

Portillo's trades at just 10x 2024e EBITDA (and 9x 2025e EBITDA) which is a significant discount to other growing restaurant chains. While I consider the valuations of Cava (100x 2024e EBITDA and 80x 2025e EBITDA) and Kura Sushi (KRUS) at 60x 2024e EBITDA to be euphoric, Shake Shack (SHAK) which I consider to be the most comparable peer now trades for 21x 2024e EBITDA (and ~17.5x 2025e EBITDA).

Financial Targets (1Q24 Investor Presentation)

Having optimized restaurant formats and greatly improved the restaurant opening process, Portillo's has increased its unit growth targets. Moreover, as the company expands deeper into markets like Phoenix and Dallas, it well benefit from improved scale in advertising and logistics/distribution. While comps will be weighed down by its outsized Chicago footprint, I see management's target of low to mid teens EBITDA growth as achievable. As such, I see an EBITDA multiple of 13x as reasonable which suggests a 2025 fair value of $16 per share or 60% upside. Moreover, as Portillo's proves out its growth model, we could see the multiple expand to 15x (which would still be a large discount to the sector) which would imply a value of $23 (32% annualized) looking out to 2027.

Risks

As mentioned above, consumers are tightening their belts when it comes to spending on restaurants and it is possible that this causes further deterioration in same store sales.

Portillo's has net debt to EBITDA of 3x. While I believe this level of leverage is manageable, the balance sheet could become stretched if operating results underperform expectations.

Portillo's is a small cap stock with a market capitalization below $800 million. Small cap stocks have significantly underperformed large caps over the past several years and it is possible that this trend may continue.

Conclusion

While sluggish consumer spending has dampened the near term outlook, I think the medium-term picture for Portillo's is fairly bright. With shares trading at a large discount to my estimate of fair value, I've taken a position in the stock.","While I was negative on Portillo's in late 2022 (with the stock at 20) and neutral earlier this year at 14, below $10 per share I am a buyer of the stock (and the delicious Italian beef sandwiches).
Financial Targets (1Q24 Investor Presentation)Having optimized restaurant formats and greatly improved the restaurant opening process, Portillo's has increased its unit growth targets.
While comps will be weighed down by its outsized Chicago footprint, I see management's target of low to mid teens EBITDA growth as achievable.

Seeking Alpha,https://seekingalpha.com/article/4701742-chewy-stock-chwy-rally-will-fade?source=feed_all_articles,2024-06-30,17:59:39 UTC,Chewy: This Stock Rally Will Fade (NYSE:CHWY),"boytsov

After more than a year in the penalty box for slower growth and weaker consumer spending, Chewy (NYSE:CHWY) has been on a recent tear. Driven by both a combination of well-received earnings prints as well as being talked up by the meme stock pundit “Roaring Kitty,” Chewy is now up ~15% year to date.

Yet amid the sharp recent rise, we do have to ask ourselves: how much strength has already been priced in, and can the rally keep going?

Data by YCharts

I last wrote a bullish article on Chewy in March, when the stock was still trading at a mere ~$18 per share. I had argued at the time that a reasonable valuation, share buybacks, and expanding margins would help drive the stock toward a rebound. Since then, Chewy has skyrocketed more than 70%, obliging me to re-assess my previous thesis on this company.

Yes - it’s true that Chewy’s recent Q1 earnings print, released in late May, showed a very positive margin story. Higher gross margins helped to feed substantial growth in adjusted EBITDA and free cash flow, which prompted the company to raise its full-year outlook. But now we do have to ask ourselves: how much of this strength is already priced in?

At current levels, I see a more balanced bull and bear thesis for this company, and I’m downgrading the stock to a neutral rating.

Here are the positives I still see for Chewy:

Beloved consumer brand that is a clear category leader. Chewy has built up quite a lot of brand equity around being a very customer service-oriented company. This has helped the company build up a base of more than 20 million active customers, many of whom have their orders on autoship plans.

Chewy has built up quite a lot of brand equity around being a very customer service-oriented company. This has helped the company build up a base of more than 20 million active customers, many of whom have their orders on autoship plans. Margin expansion was driven by expanding product categories. Chewy's push to grow its own brand (Tylee's), plus focus more on selling higher-margin hardgoods, has proven very effective at producing margin expansion. Gross margins have recently expanded to ~29%, vs. low-20s at the onset of the pandemic. In addition, Chewy's success at passing on price increases to its customers has allowed it to preserve this gross margin progress even in the current inflationary environment.

In addition, Chewy's success at passing on price increases to its customers has allowed it to preserve this gross margin progress even in the current inflationary environment. Nascent opportunities in pet telehealth and pet insurance. The craze in telehealth and doctor consultations via your mobile device is spilling over into the pet world, too. The company's ""Chewy Health"" offering has built out a ""Connect With A Vet"" service, and it also has rolled out a pet pharmacy as well. In August, the company rolled out its ""CarePlus"" pet insurance plan, which was recently bolstered through a new partnership with Lemonade's (LMND) pet insurance vertical. This is a broad, new opportunity for Chewy that can both accelerate its growth and grow its margins.

And yet now, I do see a number of risks as well:

Commoditized product. While Chewy has certainly built up a following with autoship and its reputation for excellent customer service, at the end of the day the company is not selling differentiated goods and competes with brick and mortar pet outlets, both local shops and national chains.

While Chewy has certainly built up a following with autoship and its reputation for excellent customer service, at the end of the day the company is not selling differentiated goods and competes with brick and mortar pet outlets, both local shops and national chains. Decelerating growth. Despite the shift in focus to the margin story, Chewy is still ultimately a low-margin retailer that requires economies of scale; and it hasn’t been able to slow its pace of deceleration.

We can also no longer quite make the argument that Chewy is cheap. At current share prices near $27, the company trades at a market cap of $11.87 billion. And after we net off the $1.14 billion in cash off the company’s latest balance sheet (much of which is earmarked for buybacks), the company’s resulting enterprise value is $10.73 billion.

Meanwhile, as shown in the chart below, the company has updated its guidance to $11.6-$11.8 billion in revenue (4-6% y/y growth) and a 4.1-4.3% adjusted EBITDA margin, compared to a prior outlook of 3.8% adjusted EBITDA margins on the same revenue profile.

Chewy outlook (Chewy Q1 earnings deck)

The midpoint of Chewy’s latest outlook calls for $491.4 million in adjusted EBITDA. This puts the stock’s valuation multiple at 21.8x EV/FY24 adjusted EBITDA.

To me, the stock’s rising margin profile is balanced against slower growth, and I’m not willing to pay a >20x multiple of current-year EBITDA. I’m happily locking in gains (especially as “meme stock rallies” can tend to be shorter-lived in nature) and moving to the sidelines for a better entry point down the road.

Q1 download

Let’s now go through the company’s latest quarterly results in greater detail. The Q1 earnings summary is shown below:

Chewy Q1 results (Chewy Q1 earnings deck)

Revenue grew just 3.1% y/y to $2.88 billion, ahead of Wall Street’s $2.85 billion expectations (2.1% growth). But as can be seen in the chart below, growth has been decelerating sharply over the past few quarters, and fell 120bps sequentially from 4.3% growth in Q4. Only a year ago, Chewy had been growing revenue in the mid-teens.

Chewy trended revenue (Chewy Q1 earnings deck)

The good news: despite weaker macro conditions for discretionary pet spending, Chewy notes that it has been able to retain customers as well as reactivate lapsed customers at a better rate than expected. Per CEO Sumit Singh’s remarks on the Q1 earnings call:

Our Autoship customer base remains healthy and is continuing to grow. Further, on the topic of customers this quarter, we saw some encouraging customer trends. The work we have been doing to sharpen our already strong value proposition, for example, through pet type personalization began to pay off this quarter. Our efforts are driving higher response rates and had a positive effect on net new customers as well as reactivated customers, which were particularly strong in the quarter and up mid-teens relative to the prior year period. Notably for the first time since 2022, both new customer acquisition and reactivations modestly exceeded our internal expectations in Q1.""

Additionally encouraging was a continued trend in rising gross margins. As shown below, gross margins rose 130bps y/y and 150bps sequentially to an all time record of 29.7%. The boost in margins was primarily driven by revenue mix, as the company’s sponsored ads and insurance sales have become a slightly more meaningful percentage of company revenue.

Opex cost controls have also helped to push Adjusted EBITDA up to $163 million: up 47% y/y and also representing an EBITDA margin record of 5.7%, up 170bps y/y.

Key takeaways

In my view, the market has already given Chewy plenty of credit for its goody in profits and margin expansion. With its higher valuation, I’d prefer to de-risk my position and move to the sidelines.","Chewy outlook (Chewy Q1 earnings deck)The midpoint of Chewy’s latest outlook calls for $491.4 million in adjusted EBITDA.

Growing up in Guatemala, Ruth Monrroy often spent time at her mother’s restaurant watching in awe of how she connected with customers.

“I knew I wanted to have my own business,” Mrs. Monrroy said on a recent weekday afternoon on Hollywood Boulevard, where her childhood wish has come true.

Mrs. Monrroy, 44, parks her metal cart in front of the TCL Chinese Theater six days a week, selling items including fruit salad, hot dogs and energy drinks.

“Mango, water, soda, Gatorade, hot dog!” she calls out to the crowds traipsing over Hollywood Walk of Fame stars dedicated to Bruce Willis and Billy Crystal.

Street vending is a quintessential California job — from the pickup trucks selling cartons of strawberries next to fields near Fresno to the pop-up stands offering carne asada tacos along Oakland thoroughfares. In Los Angeles alone, an estimated 10,000 street vendors sell food.

Until recently, vendors along Hollywood Boulevard were operating outside the law. And while that legal cloud has lifted, eking out a living remains a challenge. Cost-conscious tourists sometimes scoff at the prices, even if sellers struggle to break even. And while longtime street vendors respect and recognize the turf of other regulars, there are more sellers working in the area, and competition has increased.","“I knew I wanted to have my own business,” Mrs. Monrroy said on a recent weekday afternoon on Hollywood Boulevard, where her childhood wish has come true.

U.S. agricultural exports plummeted, prompting Mr. Trump to send $23 billion to farmers to help offset losses.

Now, as he runs for president again, Mr. Trump is promising to ratchet up his trade war to a much greater degree. He has proposed “universal baseline tariffs on most foreign products,” including higher levies on certain countries that devalue their currency. In interviews, he has floated plans for a 10 percent tariff on most imports and a tariff of 60 percent or more on Chinese goods. He has also posited cutting the federal income tax and relying on tariffs for revenue instead.

Mr. Trump, who once proclaimed himself “Tariff Man,” has long argued that tariffs would boost American factories, end the gap between what America imported and what it exported and increase American jobs.","They hit back, imposing tariffs on American soybeans, whiskey, orange juice and motorcycles.

Inflation, immigration, government taxing and spending, interest rates, and trade relationships could all take center stage — and both candidates could make sweeping claims about them, as they regularly do at campaign events and other public appearances.

Given that, it could be handy to go into the event with an understanding of where the economic data stand now and what the latest research says. Below is a rundown of some of today’s hot-button topics and the context you need to follow along like a pro.

That Doesn’t Mean They Embrace Trump.,"When the White House chief of staff, Jeffrey Zients, met with dozens of top executives in Washington this month, he encountered a familiar list of corporate complaints about President Biden.

The executives at the Business Roundtable, a group representing some of the country’s biggest corporations, objected to Mr. Biden’s proposals to raise taxes. They questioned the lack of business representation in the Cabinet. They bristled at what they called overregulation by federal agencies.

While the meeting was not antagonistic, it was indicative of three and a half years of executive grousing about Mr. Biden. Business leaders have criticized his remarks on “corporate greed” and his appearance on a union picket line. They chafe at the actions of officials he has appointed — particularly the head of the Federal Trade Commission, Lina Khan, who has moved to block a series of corporate mergers.

A number of prominent figures in Silicon Valley and on Wall Street — including the venture capitalists David Sacks and Marc Andreessen, and the hedge fund magnate Kenneth Griffin — have grown increasingly vocal in their criticism of Mr. Biden, their praise of former President Donald J.

She spent summers getting ready to show cattle at the county fair. During the school year, she rushed home after class to feed the chickens on her family’s corn and soybean farm. Neither of her parents went to college, but they encouraged their daughter when she decided to go to Carleton, a liberal arts school a two-hour drive from their farm in Minnesota.

Despite being physically close to home, Ms. Lunz Trujillo was surprised by how foreign her upbringing seemed at the college. She was dismayed when she checked out the farm club and learned that its members wanted to brew kombucha, not milk cows. When an art history teacher asked students which famous paintings they’d seen in person, Ms. Lunz Trujillo stayed quiet, because she had never been to an art museum. This sense of cultural alienation molded her research when she became a political scientist: What is rural identity? How does it shape a person’s politics?

So Detroit Is Making Changes.,"In January 2020, Robert Williams spent 30 hours in a Detroit jail because facial recognition technology suggested he was a criminal. The match was wrong, and Mr. Williams sued.

On Friday, as part of a legal settlement over his wrongful arrest, Mr. Williams got a commitment from the Detroit Police Department to do better. The city adopted new rules for police use of facial recognition technology that the American Civil Liberties Union, which represented Mr. Williams, says should be the new national standard.

“We hope that it moves the needle in the right direction,” Mr. Williams said.

Mr. Williams was the first person known to be wrongfully arrested based on faulty facial recognition. But he wasn’t the last. The Detroit police arrested at least two other people as a result of facial recognition searches gone awry, including a woman who was charged with carjacking when she was eight months pregnant.

Law enforcement agencies across the country use facial recognition technology to try to identify criminals whose misdeeds are caught on camera. In Michigan, the software compares an unknown face to those in a database of mug shots or drivers’ license photos. In other jurisdictions, the police use tools, like Clearview AI, that search through photos scraped from social media sites and the public internet.","In January 2020, Robert Williams spent 30 hours in a Detroit jail because facial recognition technology suggested he was a criminal.

In buying Spirit, Boeing hopes to stem quality problems that have plagued the supplier in recent years. While it already has significant influence over Spirit, Boeing will more easily be able to monitor and change production practices by owning the business outright. Boeing has taken internal steps to improve quality, too, after a harrowing incident in which a panel blew out of one of its planes on a flight in January.

“By reintegrating Spirit,” Boeing’s chief executive, Dave Calhoun, said in a statement, the company “can fully align” its production and safety systems with its work force.

The deal, which was widely expected, was valued at $4.7 billion in stock or $8.3 billion including Spirit’s debt. It must be approved by regulators and Spirit’s shareholders to be completed. Boeing will also spin off portions of Spirit to Airbus, its European rival, as part of the transaction.

It’s Not Enough.,"Four months ago, China’s leaders announced what seemed like a straightforward and proven plan to recharge the economy: Subsidize consumers who want to replace old cars and household appliances.

The early results are not promising.

Only 113,000 cars qualified for trade-in subsidies through June 25 — a blip in a country where monthly sales exceed two million cars. And buyers of new appliances such as washing machines and refrigerators are being offered discounts of only about 10 percent, depending on what city they live in.

The incentives are not enough to bring customers into stores.

“If it is not needed, people will not go out of their way to find an old machine to participate,” said Dai Yu, the manager of an appliance store in Jingdezhen, a city in Jiangxi Province in south-central China.

The idea of providing financial incentives to spur consumer spending is not new.

In 2009, the United States, Germany, France, Spain and Austria offered so-called cash for clunkers programs to revive car sales. They paid households to scrap gas guzzlers and replace them with newer cars with better fuel economy. China itself gave extensive tax cuts and subsidies for consumers to buy new cars and household appliances. Prices for many appliances were cut in half, particularly for rural residents, and sales surged.","Four months ago, China’s leaders announced what seemed like a straightforward and proven plan to recharge the economy: Subsidize consumers who want to replace old cars and household appliances.
Only 113,000 cars qualified for trade-in subsidies through June 25 — a blip in a country where monthly sales exceed two million cars.

We don’t yet have “Madoff: The Musical,” but years after his 2021 death from kidney disease in a federal prison hospital, Bernie the Ponzi-scheming potentate keeps yielding cultural dividends. An experimental film shown at Lincoln Center. A Netflix documentary series, “The Monster of Wall Street.” And now, adding to a fat stack that includes a coloring book and an exposé by a New York Times reporter that generated its own Robert De Niro movie, a new prose probe entitled “Madoff: The Final Word.”

Final? As its own author, Richard Behar, admits: doubtful.

A longtime investigative journalist who has taken on, among other formidable institutions, the litigious Church of Scientology, Behar spent 15 years seemingly half-shackled to and half-tickled by this, his first book. Along with many, many secondary interviews, he visited Madoff in prison thrice; talked to him on the phone about 50 times; and received from him dozens of handwritten letters and hundreds of emails.(He’s far from the first or only reporter to have visited the man in the clink, but the passage of time has loosened some auxiliary tongues — though death has stilled others.)

For every dollar he stole, Madoff seems to have generated at least one piece of regular paper. The hoard of 30 million documents he didn’t manage to destroy, Behar writes, “is nearly half the size of the printed material collection of the U.S. Library of Congress.” The shredding operation Madoff ran starting in the mid-90s, in a Brooklyn facility now called Tuck-It-Away, was like an A.S.M.R. orgy: burlap bags of the scraps taken to a nearby recycling plant, his secrets “dissolving to mulch.”","MADOFF: The Final Word, by Richard BeharWe don’t yet have “Madoff: The Musical,” but years after his 2021 death from kidney disease in a federal prison hospital, Bernie the Ponzi-scheming potentate keeps yielding cultural dividends.

An experiment carried out in Kansas and Germany has shed some light on the mystery.

Scientists failed to find evidence that the virus can spread as a respiratory infection. Juergen Richt, a virologist at Kansas State University who helped lead the research, said that the results suggested that the virus is mainly infectious via contaminated milking machines.

In an interview, Dr. Richt said that the results offered hope that the outbreak could be halted before the virus evolved into a form that could spread readily between humans.

“I think this is good news that we can most likely control it easier than people thought,” Dr. Richt said. “Hopefully we can now kick this thing in the behind and knock it out.”","Ever since scientists discovered influenza infecting American cows earlier this year, they have been puzzling over how it spreads from one animal to another.

Trump.

The prime-time bout, organized by CNN and simulcast on more than a dozen networks, was easily the most-viewed moment of the 2024 presidential campaign, the sort of mass civic gathering that is increasingly rare in a choose-your-own-news era of media. And the figure released on Friday by Nielsen, which mostly measures traditional TV sets, did not include the likely millions more who watched on digital news sites and social media platforms.

The size of the TV audience — similar to that for an N.F.L. conference championship game — could be grim news for the Biden campaign, given the shaky and stumbling performance by the president, which set off panic in the upper echelons of the Democratic Party.

But viewership was also down 30 percent from the first Biden-Trump debate in September 2020, which notched more than 73 million viewers. Nielsen said Thursday’s matchup in Atlanta was the lowest-rated general-election debate since the final meeting of George W. Bush and John Kerry in 2004.","The numbers are in: 51.3 million Americans tuned in live to watch Thursday night’s televised debate between President Biden and former President Donald J. Trump.

The recalculations are necessary because key parts of President Biden’s new student loan repayment program, SAVE, were temporarily blocked by two federal judges on Monday, just a week before many borrowers’ payments were scheduled to be reduced by as much as half.

The judges, in Kansas and Missouri, issued separate preliminary injunctions this week, leaving the SAVE plan’s eight million enrollees in limbo until lawsuits, filed in the spring by two groups of Republican-led states seeking to topple the program, are resolved. The Justice Department recently filed a request on behalf of the Education Department to stop the Kansas injunction.

“If the injunction takes effect,” the filing said, “it will inflict irreparable harm on the federal government in the form of unrecoverable disruption costs and create extraordinary confusion and chaos for borrowers.”","Roughly three million borrowers with federal student loans will see their monthly payments paused in the coming days, as the Biden administration tries to recalculate their bills to comply with a federal court order in Kansas.

The deal will help Rivian, which has never turned a quarterly profit, make more electric vehicles and help convince investors of its stability. It will provide Volkswagen with the software expertise that auto analysts say it sorely lacks. And it’s a bet by Volkswagen, which could become a large shareholder of Rivian if regulators approve the deal, that Rivian will meet its promise of becoming “the next Tesla,” something that has so far proved elusive.

Rivian, which was founded in 2009 as Mainstream Motors, had billions in investments by 2021, including from Amazon, BlackRock and Ford.

But as the case with many new electric vehicle companies, Rivian has also experienced hiccups in trying to ramp up to production, made harder by supply chain issues during the pandemic.

People worried about bills, feeling overwhelmed about overspending or concerned about money management may expect a “money talk” to lead to an argument, so they avoid bringing up the topic, according to a report from researchers at Cornell University and Yale University, published this month in The Journal of Consumer Psychology. Yet prior research has found that communicating about money helps couples spend more responsibly and better manage their debt.

“They anticipate conflict, so they’re choosing not to have these conversations at all,” said Emily Garbinsky, associate professor of marketing and management communication at Cornell’s business school and one of the study’s authors.

Why is it so difficult for some people to talk about money with their partners in the first place?

Aja Evans, a financial therapist in New York, said people may feel ashamed that they are having money troubles. They may worry that talking about such things with their partner will hurt their relationship.

The company, Kobayashi Pharmaceutical, in March had reported five deaths potentially linked to its CholesteHelp rice and red-yeast pills. Japanese government health officials said the supplement, which claimed to help reduce cholesterol, contained puberulic acid, a highly toxic compound that is a product of mold.

In response to the sudden surge in reported deaths, Health Minister Keizo Takemi said it was “extremely regrettable” that Kobayashi Pharmaceutical had not updated the ministry sooner. The company, which is based in Osaka, had not provided new information on deaths potentially linked to CholesteHelp since March.

Since then, Kobayashi Pharmaceutical has received reports that 1,656 people sought medical advice for CholesteHelp-related health concerns, and 289 people have been hospitalized, the company reported. CholesteHelp has been recalled in Japan and China, the only countries the supplement was sold in, according to a spokeswoman for Kobayashi Pharmaceutical.","A Japanese pharmaceutical company is investigating 80 deaths possibly linked to a yeast-containing supplement it sells in Japan, the country’s health ministry said Friday, in a shocking increase from an earlier revelation that is focusing attention on how supplements are regulated.

He was 77.

The cause was cancer, said Brad Turell, a family spokesman.

Mr. Kellner was one of the most successful television executives of his generation. His knack for capturing young viewers — first men at Fox, then women at WB — lured viewers away from the Big Three networks that had ruled television for nearly 40 years.

Mr. Kellner believed that ABC, NBC and CBS were ignoring viewers under 35 and were hamstrung by middle-of-the-road taste. Rupert Murdoch, the owner of Fox Inc., and Barry Diller, its chairman, recruited Mr. Kellner from the television syndication business in 1986 and installed him as president of the Fox Broadcasting Company.

Its aspiration to be the first new TV network since ABC in 1948 was broadly derided.

Rupert Murdoch, the owner of Fox Inc., and Barry Diller, its chairman, recruited Mr. Kellner from the television syndication business in 1986 and installed him as president of the Fox Broadcasting Company.
Its aspiration to be the first new TV network since ABC in 1948 was broadly derided.","['tv', 'broadcasting', 'mr', 'family', 'kellner', 'viewers', 'dies', 'network', 'jamie', 'wb', 'fox', 'television', 'executive', 'started', '77', 'helped']",https://static01.nyt.com/images/2024/06/30/multimedia/26Kellner-03-bclq-print1/26Kellner-03-bclq-facebookJumbo.jpg,False,jami kellner media execut help build fox broadcast thrive televis network show like `` bever hill `` `` the simpson '' -- went creat wb network known angsti `` dawson 's creek '' `` buffi vampir slayer '' -- die june home montecito calif near santa barbara caus cancer said brad turel famili spokesman mr kellner one success televis execut generat knack captur young viewer -- first men fox women wb -- lure viewer away big three network rule televis near year mr kellner believ abc nbc cbs ignor viewer hamstrung middleoftheroad tast rupert murdoch owner fox inc barri diller chairman recruit mr kellner televis syndic busi instal presid fox broadcast compani aspir first new tv network sinc abc broad derid debut first seri lowbrow famili sitcom `` marri ... children '' shown six murdochown station string independ one mr kellner help stitch togeth new network began steal big three 's audienc

The truth is that they spend most of their time trying to minimize risk.

It’s why theaters are clogged with vacuous sequels. It’s why so many Hollywood power players hide behind P.R. people. And it’s why all of the big movie studios and streaming services — and, in fact, most indie film companies — declined to distribute “The Apprentice,” a dramatized origin story about Donald J. Trump that the former president has called “malicious defamation” and showered with cease-and-desist letters.

But the movie business still has at least one wildcatter: Tom Ortenberg.

Mr. Ortenberg, 63, and his Briarcliff Entertainment are pushing to complete a deal to acquire “The Apprentice” for wide release in theaters in the United States in September or early October — close enough to the presidential election to bask in its heat, but far enough away to avoid final-stretch media overload. Briarcliff’s pursuit of the $16 million film was confirmed by five people involved with the sale process, who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss a private negotiation.

“Tom’s got more courage than most people in Hollywood combined,” said Stephen Galloway, the dean of Chapman University’s film school. “His interest in this kind of movie involves business, of course. He sees money to be made by leveraging millions of dollars in free publicity. But part of it is wanting to do his bit. He’s liberal and cares about social issues.”","The truth is that they spend most of their time trying to minimize risk.

Founded in 1979 and distinguished by its commitment to presenting work by living American writers, Second Stage said that its board had chosen Evan Cabnet as its next artistic director. Cabnet is currently the artistic director of LCT3, Lincoln Center Theater’s program for emerging writers, directors and designers. Cabnet will succeed Carole Rothman, one of the theater’s founders, who led the organization for 45 years and is stepping down in August.

Second Stage has a proud history of presenting acclaimed work, including the Pulitzer-winning shows “Between Riverside and Crazy,” “Water by the Spoonful” and “Next to Normal.” Its plays and musicals have won multiple other honors; most recently, the organization’s production of “Appropriate” won this year’s Tony Award for best play revival.

Second Stage owns Broadway’s smallest house, the 600-seat Hayes Theater. Like many nonprofit theaters, Second Stage has reduced its footprint since the pandemic — it let go of its Off Off Broadway space on the Upper West Side, and at the end of this year is letting go of its Off Broadway venue in Times Square, although it plans to continue to produce such work in other spaces, starting next spring at the Pershing Square Signature Center. The organization currently has 47 staffers and an annual budget of $27 million; this season it is planning to stage two Broadway shows, two Off Broadway shows and a Next Stage Festival for early-career work.","Second Stage Theater, one of the four nonprofit organizations with Broadway houses, on Thursday named a new artistic director as the sector braces for a wave of leadership turnover.

All eyes will be on CNN at 9 p.m. Eastern, when President Biden and Donald Trump face off in their first debate since 2020. Among the keenest watchers will be executives and investors looking for signs about how the candidates might handle the economy and business in a second term.

There will be plenty to scrutinize in the 90-minute, audience-free debate, including what the candidates say and how they say it. Here’s what we will be looking out for. (And, for a lighter take, check out our debate “bingo card” further below.)

The economy is the big question. Various measures show strong growth under Biden, but many voters feel differently. What will Biden and Trump say about some of the key issues?

Inflation: This is clearly a challenge for the president, as Americans complain about what they’re paying in the grocery store, at the pump and on their rent. Biden can say that price increases are slowing down, and will most likely emphasize his administration’s efforts to crack down on “corporate greed,” like taking on so-called junk fees. Trump will probably stress how good things were when he took office in 2017 — an economy many Americans want back.

Taxes: Biden’s proposals for higher corporate taxes will hit profits: “It’s simple math,” David Bahnsen, the founder and chief investment officer of the Bahnsen Group, told DealBook. Many business leaders don’t like Biden’s plan to increase taxes on the wealthy, either. Trump will probably stress his desire to extend his 2017 tax cuts and lower the corporate rate to 20 percent. But questions about corporate earnings and the economy may eclipse those concerns.

Protectionism: Both candidates want to increase tariffs on Chinese goods, but Biden has been more targeted in how he has done it during his presidency. Trump has proposed significantly higher across-the-board levies, though it’s unclear how serious he is about it. Economists have warned that Trump’s potential approach could aggravate inflation and hurt the economy.

Markets: The S&P 500 set 31 records this year; investors will hope neither party messes with that momentum. In Thursday night’s debate, “markets probably care more about presentation than policy pledges,” Paul Donovan, an economist at UBS, wrote in a client note. Biden may have a slight edge, he added, since investors would prefer keeping “some continuity.”

Other issues will probably feature prominently. Biden will most likely raise abortion rights, a topic that has helped Democrats win in recent elections. Trump will almost certainly speak a lot about immigration, perhaps his most potent issue — and one that many, including Elon Musk, say is a failure of Biden’s.

The intangibles will matter. Executives told DealBook that C.E.O.s will be paying attention to how Biden and Trump perform:

For Biden, 81, an important issue for business leaders and many voters is whether he is still fit to serve. A sharp, forceful performance could go a ways in quieting any concerns.

For Trump, 78, competence is a question as well. But his demeanor will also be under scrutiny, especially if he comes across as overly abrasive or erratic. Some executives said their feelings would come down to whether they can stomach another four years of a Trump presidency.

There’s also the show around the show. Trump has suggested that his potential running mate would be in Atlanta for the debate. The Times reports that his list is narrowing, with Senator J.D. Vance of Ohio, Gov. Doug Burgum of North Dakota and Senator Marco Rubio of Florida being of particular interest.","Talking pointsAll eyes will be on CNN at 9 p.m. Eastern, when President Biden and Donald Trump face off in their first debate since 2020.
Among the keenest watchers will be executives and investors looking for signs about how the candidates might handle the economy and business in a second term.

Addressing reporters at a company factory in Renton, Wash., Elizabeth Lund, a Boeing executive, provided new details on Tuesday about how the plane involved in the incident left the plant apparently without four critical bolts that secured the panel, known as a door plug, in place.

Boeing said the information was not for release until Thursday morning, under a common kind of agreement that allowed the attending reporters time to process the detailed briefing.

But the National Transportation Safety Board became aware of the remarks at the briefing and rebuked the company hours before articles on the remarks were published. It said that Boeing improperly shared investigative information and speculated about the cause of the incident, adding that the company had “blatantly violated” the agency’s rules surrounding active investigations. The agency said it would provide details about that violation to the Justice Department, which is investigating the January flight.","Boeing drew fresh criticism from a federal regulator on Thursday over disclosures about the continuing investigation into a harrowing January flight during which one of the company’s 737 Max planes lost a panel, exposing passengers to howling winds at an altitude of about 16,000 feet.

I am a single American mother living in Jordan and working for the United Nations. In September 2019, I adopted my then 5-year-old son from China, and promised him we would return to visit his country every year. But the pandemic broke out. When China finally reopened to tourists in 2023, we got visas and booked a July flight to Beijing via Doha on Qatar Airways, paying about $1,400 total. My now 9-year-old had worked hard to maintain his language and was excited, but nervous. At that time, the Chinese government required passengers to fill out a “Health Declaration Form” in advance or upon arrival. The link on the Qatar Airways website was broken, but I confirmed online and with friends who had recently traveled to China that I could fill it out upon arrival. At the airport, Qatar Airways disagreed, and when I once again couldn’t get the form to work, we were denied boarding. My son collapsed on the airport floor, sobbing. I rebooked for the next day, and we flew to Beijing via Istanbul on Royal Jordanian and China Southern for $1,882. Neither airline requested to see the QR code showing my form had been approved: All passengers upon arrival were made to fill out new forms. Qatar Airways mostly refunded the tickets — we received $1,185 — but refused to admit it was wrong. Considering the more expensive last-minute flight and other costs (such as rebooking domestic flights and trains in China) we are out about $930. I believe the airline should provide a flight voucher that compensates us for that amount. Can you help? Elizabeth, Amman, Jordan

Dear Elizabeth,

Your run-in with the complex world of international travel documentation was especially devastating because of the emotional stakes this trip represented for your family. But confusion over documentation leads to denied boarding “thousands of times a day,” said Max Tremaine, the chief executive of Sherpa, a company that maintains a database of international entrance requirements for travelers.

Not to excuse Qatar Airways for what I will charitably call a vigorous over-enforcement of the rules, but those frontline airline workers facing long lines at check-in can have a difficult task, making snap judgments on whether travelers have sufficient documents or not.

Countries all have their own entry rules depending on the passports that travelers hold and where they are coming from, and airlines are fined when they mistakenly allow people to fly. The decision may be straightforward when their customers are an American family with valid passports headed direct from New York to London for a week’s vacation. But travel can be complicated — consider, say, when a Dutch banker is on his way to Bangladesh via Cairo or an Australian trapeze artist with a one-way ticket heads to a performance in Kyrgyzstan through Frankfurt.The pandemic only complicated this complicated system. In your situation, your itinerary had you going through Qatar Airways’ hub in Doha, meaning those behind you in line in Jordan were probably headed to dozens of countries, all with their own rules.","When China finally reopened to tourists in 2023, we got visas and booked a July flight to Beijing via Doha on Qatar Airways, paying about $1,400 total.

That means the Biden administration cannot reduce borrowers’ monthly bills by as much as half starting July 1, as had been scheduled, and it must pause debt forgiveness to SAVE enrollees. The administration has canceled $5.5 billion in debt for more than 414,000 borrowers through the plan, which opened in August.

So Why Are a Quarter of Women Still Paying for It?,"Last week, Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont, chair of the Senate health committee, called on a government watchdog to investigate why insurance companies are still charging women for birth control — a move that thrust access to contraceptives back into the spotlight.

In a letter to the Government Accountability Office, the senator noted that insurance companies were charging Americans for contraceptives that, under federal law, should be free — and that they were also denying appeals from consumers who were seeking to have their contraceptives covered. Some experts estimate that those practices could affect access to birth control for millions of women.

Since 2012, the Affordable Care Act has mandated that private insurance plans cover the “full range” of contraceptives for women approved by the Food and Drug Administration, including female sterilizations, emergency contraceptives and any new products cleared by the F.D.A. The mandate also covers services associated with contraceptives, like counseling, insertions or removals and follow-up care.

That means that consumers shouldn’t have any associated co-payments with in-network providers, even if they haven’t met their deductibles. Some plans might cover only generic versions of certain contraceptives, but patients are still entitled to coverage of a specific product that their providers deem medically necessary. Medicaid plans have a similar provision; the only exception to the mandate are plans sponsored by employers or colleges that have religious or moral objections.","Some experts estimate that those practices could affect access to birth control for millions of women.

Luckily, keeping tabs on the world's most successful investors isn't very hard to do.

Every three months, people managing a portfolio worth $100 million or more have to report their trading activity to the Securities and Exchange Commission. A quick look at the latest disclosures shows a handful of billionaire investors bought millions of shares of two dividend-paying stocks that currently offer ultra-high yields.

Shares of Pfizer (NYSE: PFE) and Annaly Capital (NYSE: NLY) offer yields that are several times the average stock in the benchmark S&P 500 index. Unfortunately, stocks rarely offer yields this high unless there's a good reason to worry about their ability to maintain their payout.

Let's look at their recent performance to find out if following the lead of billionaire fund managers makes sense for your portfolio.

Annaly Capital

Annaly Capital is a real estate investment trust (REIT) that buys mortgage-backed securities (MBSes) instead of real estate. It earns a living in the margins between its short-term borrowing expenses and the interest it receives from the hopefully higher-yielding MBS in its portfolio.

At recent prices, Annaly shares offer a mind-blowing 13.6% yield. The enormous yield is attracting funds run by billionaires. Citadel Advisors, which is run by Ken Griffin, and Millennium Management, which is run by Israel Englander, bought shares in the first quarter.

Annaly Capital doesn't own real estate, so it has to use its MBS portfolio to secure loans. It doesn't happen often, but from time to time, the value of its MBS can dip. When this happens, lenders demand more capital, and the company can end up selling off portions of its portfolio at fire sale prices.

NLY Dividend Chart

Before you jump up to fill your portfolio with shares of Annaly Capital, it's important to realize the company has lowered its dividend by 45.8% since 2019. Investors who bought the stock and reinvested all the dividends have gained only about 39% over the past decade.

While there's a good chance that buying Annaly Capital now and holding over the long run also leads to positive gains, the unpredictability of its dividend makes it a bad choice for most income-seeking investors.

Pfizer

During the first three months of 2024, John Overdeck and David Siegel of Two Sigma bought 18.9 million shares of Pfizer. The stock has fallen by more than half since its peak in late 2021.

Story continues

Pfizer's been dropping because record-breaking sales of its COVID-19-related products evaporated faster than the market expected. Now that the worst is over, though, the stock looks like a terrific bargain.

Pfizer's stock dropped, but the company still raised its dividend payout for the 15th consecutive year last December. The stock offers a 6.2% yield at recent prices, which is about 4.6 times more than you'd receive from the average dividend payer in the S&P 500.

At recent prices, you can buy Pfizer for around 11.6 times forward-looking earnings expectations. That's a reasonable valuation for a business you expect to grow at a snail's pace. A look at this drugmaker's recent performance and forward outlook suggests it will grow much faster than the market is expecting.

Pfizer invested heaps of COVID-19-related profits into new drugs, many of which are already on the market. If we exclude COVID-19-related sales and the negative effects of a stronger U.S. dollar, first-quarter sales rose 11% year over year.

Pfizer has the longest list of innovative new drugs in the pharmaceutical industry, and it's still growing relatively quickly. The FDA approved nine new medicines from the company in 2023, and they're poised to drive growth in the decade ahead. Adding some shares to a diversified portfolio looks like a relatively safe way for income-seeking investors to boost their passive income stream.

Yahoo Finance,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/much-savings-70-140006145.html,2024-06-30,21:00:53 UTC,How Much Does the Average 70 Year Old Have Saved?,"how much does the average 70-year-old have in savings

Part of retirement planning includes determining how much to save and invest so you can enjoy the type of lifestyle you desire. Setting your savings target by age can be a good way to organize your strategy and gauge how to track progress with your goals. You might also be interested in how much the typical retiree has saved at age 65, 70 and beyond. In this article, we’re going to focus on how much the average person has saved and possibly should have saved at the age of 70. Keep in mind, though, that your situation is still completely unique to what your goals are. You may want to work with a financial advisor to make sure your savings goals are in line with where you need to be later on.

How Much Does the Average 70-Year-Old Have in Savings?

According to data from the Federal Reserve’s most recent Survey of Consumer Finances, the average 65 to 74-year-old has a little over $426,000 saved. That’s money that’s specifically set aside in retirement accounts, including 401(k) plans and IRAs.

The Federal Reserve also measures median and mean (average) savings across other types of financial assets. According to the data, the average 70-year-old has approximately:

$60,000 in transaction accounts (including checking and savings)

$127,000 in certificate of deposit (CD) accounts

$17,000 in savings bonds

$43,000 in cash value life insurance

In terms of overall trends, the numbers show an increase over the previous Survey of Consumer Finances. According to that survey, the average 65 to 75-year-old had $381,000 saved for retirement in 2016. That figure, however, was well below the $486,000 70-year-olds had saved on average in 2013.

Whether the Survey of Consumer Finances for 2022 shows an uptick in savings or a decline remains to be seen. While Social Security benefits have seen several cost-of-living increases since the last survey was completed, persistently high inflation has put more pressure on Americans’ spending power. The survey may show that 70-year-olds have less in retirement savings if they’re spending more to compensate for higher prices.

If you’re ready to be matched with local advisors that can help you achieve your financial goals, get started now.

How Much Should a 70-Year-Old Have in Savings?

Financial experts generally recommend saving anywhere from $1 million to $2 million for retirement. If you consider an average retirement savings of $426,000 for those in the 65 to 74-year-old range, the numbers obviously don’t match up.

The amount a 70-year-old should save for retirement can depend on several things, including:

Story continues

Desired retirement lifestyle

When they apply for Social Security benefits

Other sources of retirement income, such as a 401(k), IRA, pension or annuity

Other savings, including taxable brokerage accounts, savings accounts and CDs

Overall health and life expectancy

The more money you anticipate spending to cover your cost of living in retirement, the more you’ll typically need to save. Social Security benefits are a staple part of many retirees’ income picture, but those payments may only go so far. Pensions, meanwhile, are becoming more of a rarity as employers opt for defined contribution plans instead.

Long-term care can put a strain on retiree budgets and increase the amount of money you need to save. Medicare doesn’t cover long-term care though Medicaid does. But to qualify for Medicaid, you’ll typically need to spend down your assets. Purchasing long-term care insurance can be a workaround so you’re not at risk of draining your savings.

What Is a Good Net Worth at 70?

how much does the average 70-year-old have in savings

Net worth is a measure of your assets vs. your liabilities. In other words, it’s the difference between what you own and what you owe.

The average net worth of Americans aged 65 to 74 hovers around $1.2 million. The median net worth is lower, at $164,000. The typical 70-year-old has around $105,000 in debt, including mortgages, home equity loans, credit cards and student loans, as measured by the Fed’s data.

What constitutes a good net worth is situation-specific and largely linked to your retirement goals. There are different rules of thumb you can apply to come up with an ideal net worth calculation. For example, one rule suggests having a net worth at 70 that’s equivalent to 20 times your annual expenses.

If you spend $100,000 a year to live in retirement, you should have a net worth of at least $2 million. On the other hand, if you only spend $40,000 on living expenses, then your target net worth would be much lower, at $800,000.

Is Retiring at 70 a Good Idea?

Whether it makes sense to retire at 70 can depend on your finances and what you envision for your dream retirement. When choosing a retirement age, it’s helpful to consider:

When you’ll really need to take Social Security benefits

Whether you’ll still work in a part-time capacity after retiring

How long you plan to live in retirement

Your desired savings goal and current savings rate

If you can delay taking Social Security benefits until age 70, that can boost your benefit amount. You’ll be eligible to collect 132% of your benefit amount by waiting longer to apply.

You can also continue saving and investing for retirement if you’re working longer. For example, you can continue maxing out your 401(k) each year, or at the very least, contribute enough to get your full employer match. You can also funnel money into an IRA for supplemental savings.

Retiring at 70 means you’ll have a two-year gap before you’ll need to begin taking required minimum distributions (RMDs) from a traditional 401(k). You’ll also need to take RMDs if you have a Roth 401(k), but Roth IRAs are exempt from this rule.

Within that window, you might decide to convert your traditional IRA to a Roth account. Doing so can mean a higher tax bill in the year of the conversion since you’re required to pay taxes on your traditional IRA earnings. But moving forward, you’d be able to take tax-free distributions from your Roth IRA.

The Bottom Line

how much does the average 70-year-old have in savings

How much does the average 70-year-old have in savings? Just shy of $500,000, according to the Federal Reserve. The better question, however, may be whether that’s enough for a 70-year-old to live on in retirement so that you can align your budget accordingly. With no end to higher inflation in sight, retiring on $500,000 may not be realistic for everyone. The good news is that the younger you are, the more time you have to plan, save and invest for the future.

Retirement Planning Tips

Consider talking to your financial advisor about the pros and cons of retiring at 70 and what your personal timeline for retirement should look like. If you don’t have a financial advisor yet, finding one doesn’t have to be hard. SmartAsset’s free tool matches you with up to three financial advisors who serve your area, and you can interview your advisor matches at no cost to decide which one is right for you. If you’re ready to find an advisor who can help you achieve your financial goals, get started now.

Delaying Social Security benefits could help you to collect more money in retirement. Taking benefits early, however, could reduce your monthly payment amount. The earliest you can begin taking Social Security is age 62 but it may benefit you to wait until at least your full retirement age to apply. Also, keep in mind that if you do decide to take Social Security early and you continue to work, your benefit amount may be reduced even further. Understanding how to maximize Social Security benefits can help you get the most money possible.

Keep an emergency fund on hand in case you run into unexpected expenses. An emergency fund should be liquid -- in an account that isn't at risk of significant fluctuation like the stock market. The tradeoff is that the value of liquid cash can be eroded by inflation. But a high-interest account allows you to earn compound interest. Compare savings accounts from these banks.

These advanced systems can generate original content, streamline time-consuming processes, and automate procedures -- all with a few simple commands. This, in turn, promises to increase productivity and save money, which has companies racing to adopt the next-generation algorithms.

One of the most obvious beneficiaries of this trend is Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA). The company's graphics processing units (GPUs) supply the computational horsepower required to process AI training and inference. However, the investing community is beginning to look beyond the first phase of AI adoption (hardware) to what comes next, which will invariably be AI-infused software. It's estimated that generative AI software sales could soar as much as 18,647% to $280 billion by 2032, according to Bloomberg Intelligence.

While there's little doubt that Nvidia will continue to prosper from its early adoption of AI, another company has decades of experience in the field and is poised to profit as the tidal wave of AI software adoption commences.

An AI pioneer

Palantir Technologies (NYSE: PLTR) established itself as one of the early leaders in the AI revolution more than two decades ago. The company partnered with U.S. government agencies and its allies to develop AI software tools to aid in the war on terror. Its AI-powered data mining systems connected the dots between seemingly unrelated bits of information to helped flush out terrorists. In recent years Palantir has focused its attention on the enterprise sector, providing companies with actionable information to make data-driven decisions.

With decades of experience in the field, Palantir was able to pivot quickly and develop state-of-the-art generative AI tools to help businesses succeed. The company's latest brainchild is its Artificial Intelligence Platform (AIP), which provides users with keen insight to solve everyday business dilemmas.

One Palantir demo video shows the impact of shuttering a production line in the face of an oncoming hurricane. AIP provides suggestions regarding which orders to accelerate, delay, or cancel, which orders can be rerouted to other distribution centers, and how those decisions will affect backlogs and the associated sales. It can also estimate the financial impact of hiring additional trucks to accelerate high-priority deliveries before the storm hits, assessing how this will affect profits.

Most businesses would jump at the opportunity to deploy tools with those capabilities, but the complexity alone would be enough to confound all but the most technologically savvy executives. Palantir addressed the issue by staging AIP boot camps. Developers and executives alike can attend these hands-on sessions, allowing them to build sophisticated applications alongside Palantir engineers and building real-world, company-specific solutions.

Story continues

This strategy has been wildly successful, helping Palantir increase its U.S. commercial customer count by 69% year over year and 19% sequentially in the first quarter. This was largely thanks to AIP bootcamps and the resulting accelerated deal volume.

This helps illustrate the vast potential of Palantir's boot camp strategy.

The proof is in the pudding

The results have only just begun to impact the company's financial results. In the first quarter, revenue of $634 million grew 21% year over year and 4% quarter over year, resulting in Palantir's sixth consecutive quarter of profitability. U.S. commercial revenue, which includes AIP, grew 40% year over year while customers for the segment grew 69%. Remaining deal revenue (RDV), or the remaining value of contracts not yet recorded as revenue, grew 74%.

Management expects the company's growth streak to continue. Palantir increased its full-year outlook and is now expecting revenue of $2.68 billion, representing growth of 20% at the midpoint of its guidance. Perhaps more telling, however, is the expected strong showing from U.S. commercial revenue, which is expected to clock in at least $661 million, an increase of 45%. That's up compared to its guidance of 40% growth issued just last quarter. This suggests there's continuing strong demand for AIP boot camps.

Every rose has its thorns

The company's rapid growth and ties to AI aside, some investors will be put off by Palantir's valuation, which is understandable -- but looks can be deceiving. The stock currently trades for 211 times earnings and 25 times sales, which is enough to make any value investors run for cover. However, rapid growth tends to skew the most commonly used valuation metrics. However, a more useful measure in this case is the forward price/earnings-to-growth (PEG) ratio, which clocks in at 0.79, when anything less than 1 indicates an undervalued stock.

Generative AI is still in the early stages of adoption, and the resulting rollout could take years to accomplish. Palantir is poised to be an early winner in the next phase of the AI revolution thanks to its decades of expertise and brilliant go-to-market strategy.

That's why Palantir stock is a buy.

The chart of the day

What we're watching

What we're reading

Economic data releases and earnings

The weight of high expectations is often a heavy burden to carry.

In life, if you are a top performer at work, it's expected that you will show up to be a top performer every single day. Having a bad day? That's not allowed, so go sling that crap somewhere else.

Sure, some college professor who gave an inspiring leadership speech at a TED Talk 10 years ago and is now appearing in one-minute clips on your Instagram feed might suggest it's OK to have bad days at work, even if you are a winner.

Trust me, it's not — and don't let that social clip allow you to think otherwise.

This same philosophy could be applied to the stock market's most important stock: Nvidia (NVDA).

I know you like that transition, Morning Brief readers! Hear me out on this top performer in the market.

Over the past week, we were reminded of how inflated expectations are for Nvidia and how the stock has entered dangerous waters that many traders who arrived late to the Nvidia game have never navigated before.

On June 18, Nvidia's market cap hit a staggering $3.34 trillion, eclipsing Microsoft (MSFT) to become the world's most valuable company. Over the next three trading days, on seemingly no fundamental news, the company shed $430 billion in market cap.

For perspective, Coca-Cola's (KO) market cap is $275 billion.

Some folks I talked with told me people were taking profits on Nvidia going into the start of the second half of the year. Others I talked to for my ""Opening Bid"" podcast told me there is some chatter about new competitors entering Nvidia's turf, and maybe the company won't be as absurdly dominant over the next five years as many anticipate.

All of that is fair, but it reinforces the view that the stock is prone to sharp, out-of-the-blue negative shifts in sentiment because it's up 3,000% in five years.

But if you drill down further, you can see just how intense the expectations on Nvidia have become.

Nvidia's stock now trades at about 21x (super steep) forward sales, up from 12x (also steep) two months ago, according to research from Creative Planning chief market strategist Charlie Bilello. This is a significant premium over Microsoft at 12x and Apple (AAPL) at 8x, two tech titans that are performing very well fundamentally and are likely to continue rocking years ahead.



Nvidia's stock recently traded about 100% above its 200-day moving average, BTIG chief market technician Jonathan Krinsky pointed out. Since 1990, the widest spread that any US company has ever traded above its 200-day moving average while it was the largest company in the world was 80% by Cisco (CSCO) in March 2000, which marked its all-time high. ""In other words, Nvidia is in a league of its own,"" Krinsky said.

Story continues

It sure seems that way.

Similar expectations were applied to chipmaker Micron (MU) going into earnings this week. The stock got blasted due to ""in-line"" guidance that didn't meet crazy expectations for anything tied to AI demand.

And I emphasize crazy: On Monday, several sell-side analysts jacked up their estimates and price targets on Micron ahead of the report. As someone who used to manage a team of stock researchers, I can tell you that this action heading into an earnings report is not the norm.

It reeked of analysts buying into the hype too much and hoping for a giant one-day pop in the stock.

""When you get a reaction like Micron's, where the numbers should be good enough to avoid a sell-off, let alone spur a rally, that’s a bad sign — a tell that expectations are so high that they can't be exceeded,"" Interactive Brokers chief strategist Steve Sosnick told me.

Others don't agree with my assessment that Nvidia is priced for perfection, and that is totally fine. I don't have a monopoly on good ideas!

""But for medium- to longer-term investors, the story still holds when we look at how far out their capacity is booked and pricing is firming,"" Tematica Research co-founder and chief investment officer Chris Versace said.

One thing we can all agree on: Nvidia is a top-performing employee in the market, and it will get no pass for trying to take a day off if it catches a cold.

Speaking of expensive tech stocks, shares of Amazon (AMZN) are up 55% in the past year. Questions linger about its culture, however. WSJ reporter Dana Mattioli talked about her explosive new book ""The Everything War: Amazon’s Ruthless Quest to Own the World and Remake Corporate Power"" in an episode of the ""Opening Bid"" podcast.

Yahoo Finance,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/6-yield-dividend-stock-help-122200961.html,2024-06-30,12:22:00 UTC,This 6% Yield Dividend Stock Can Help You Build Wealth Brick by Brick,"Investors who strive for a specific investment return should love dividends because they are concrete returns you can't lose once paid. For example, suppose you want to earn 10% on a stock you own for a year. If that stock pays a dividend yielding 5%, you're already halfway to your goal!

You can rest easier knowing you have something to show for your investment and aren't entirely at the mercy of Wall Street's (often irrational) volatility.

Realty Income (NYSE: O) is a well-known dividend stock. It's famous for paying a rare monthly dividend and continually increasing the amount it pays. The company has raised its dividend for 31 consecutive years and counting.

You may have overlooked Realty Income recently. Shares have fallen 24% over the past five years.

Pay attention. I'll show you how powerful dividend stocks like Realty Income can be and why the stock is a wonderful buy today.

Do dividends matter? More than you realize

Realty Income is a real estate investment trust, or REIT. It's a company that acquires and leases real estate. In other words, it's like a landlord you can invest in, so that you can enjoy the cash flow real estate earns without buying buildings. Realty Income specializes in single-tenant retail properties, where one tenant, generally a consumer-facing business like a movie theater, convenience store, or gas station, rents the building.

REITs must pay at least 90% of their taxable income as dividends, so companies like Realty Income make great dividend stocks. Realty Income's dividend yield is approximately 6% at its current share price. Now, I get it. Nobody wants to be down 24% after five years. But the truth is that Realty Income's dividend has helped soften that blow quite a bit.

While the stock price is down 24% after five years, the stock's total return, including dividends, has investors close to break-even.

O Chart

To be fair to Realty Income, things have worked against the company these past five years. Real estate companies faced a generational crisis in COVID-19. Additionally, interest rates have surged higher. That's a problem for REITs because they rely heavily on borrowing to fund new property acquisitions. Realty Income has gotten a bad rap, primarily due to bad luck.

Ready to melt your mind? Zoom out further and see how big a difference dividends make over time. Realty Income has badly trailed the S&P 500 on price appreciation after decades, but it handily outperforms with dividends.

O Total Return Price Chart

Realty Income's share price declines get all the attention. Ironically, the dividends created big returns over time. Again, Realty Income's stock is down due to bad luck (pandemic and high rates), not because it's a bad business.

Story continues

Why is the stock poised for a comeback?

I suspect that Realty Income will eventually bounce back. For starters, the dividend, the most crucial aspect of the stock, is rock-solid. Analysts believe Realty Income will earn $4.22 per share this year. That is a dividend payout ratio of just 75% based on its annualized dividend per share.

Meanwhile, many expect interest rates across the U.S. economy to fall over time. The FOMC, which controls the primary interest rate in the economy, has been looking for inflation to come down, and recent data points to precisely that happening. Lower rates mean cheaper borrowing, which is a tailwind for REITs like Realty Income.

Realty Income stock now yields near its decade-high, and its price versus its cash flow is near its decade-low. That means the stock is cheap, and analysts still see Realty Income growing its distributable cash (profits for REITs) at a low-single-digit rate annually. Investors are looking at potential double-digit total returns when combining dividends and growth. A potentially higher valuation is just a bonus.

O Price to Free Cash Flow Chart

Remember, stocks like Realty Income can make you rich with their dividends. It just might take time. Investors should have no concerns over the dividend moving forward, and the stock's potential rebound is more icing on the cake than the main course.

Situations like this are how long-term investors win.

Yahoo Finance,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/broadcom-stock-once-generation-investment-091300997.html,2024-06-30,09:13:00 UTC,Is Broadcom Stock a Once-in-a-Generation Investment Opportunity Ahead of Its 10-for-1 Stock Split on July 12?,"When Broadcom (NASDAQ: AVGO) released the results of its fiscal 2024 second quarter, ended May 5, the company delivered results that sailed past Wall Street's expectations. More intriguing for shareholders, however, was another development.

In conjunction with its financial report, Broadcom's management revealed a 10-for-1 stock split. Since its announcement on Jun 12, shares have climbed 6% (as of this writing), and the stock has gained 93% over the past year. This helps to illustrate the ongoing interest from investors, likely spurred higher by the vast opportunity represented by artificial intelligence (AI).

The stock split is scheduled to take place after the market close on Friday, July 12. Does the upcoming stock split make Broadcom a once-in-a-generation investment opportunity? Let's see what the evidence reveals.

Image source: Getty Images.

Stock split recap

A quick review of the purpose of the stock split can help give this process context. If a company delivers strong operational and financial performance over an extended period, demand for stock ownership increases, which is reflected in an increasing share price. Unfortunately, this oft times makes the stock inaccessible to some everyday investors.

To rectify the situation, management can initiate a stock split, reducing the share price. The company noted in its report that the purpose of the split was ""to make ownership of Broadcom stock more accessible to investors and employees."" The result is that everyday investors will be better able to buy full shares rather than resorting to purchasing fractional shares, which are available at a number of brokerage firms.

Once the stock split is completed, shareholders of record will receive nine additional shares of Broadcom stock for every share they own. At the same time, the price of each share will be reduced to 1/10th of the price, so the total value of each shareholder's investment won't change.The stock is due to split after the market close on Friday July 12, and begin trading on a split-adjusted basis on Monday, July 15. What should be more important to investors, however, is that the same factors that have driven Broadcom stock higher in recent years will still be at work.

Is Broadcom stock a buy?

The process of the stock split aside, the quintessential investing question remains: Is Broadcom stock a buy before its highly publicized stock split? Let's take a look at the company's recent results.

In the second quarter, Broadcom reported revenue of $12.5 billion, jumping 43% year over year and 4% sequentially. This pushed adjusted earnings per share (EPS) of $10.96 up 6%. Management said robust demand for generative AI was driving the results, noting that sales of AI-related products surged to a record $3.1 billion and now accounted for 25% of the company's total revenue.

Story continues

Management suggested the trend will likely continue. Broadcom raised its full fiscal year guidance to $51 billion, which would represent year-over-year growth of 42%.

The company is also developing a consistent track record of dividend payments. Broadcom is now in its 14th consecutive year of increasing payouts. From humble beginnings in mid-2013, the company has increased its payout from $0.21 to $5.25 per quarter, an increase of 2,400%. Wall Street expects Broadcom to earn $47.49 per share in 2024. That works out to a payout ratio of 44% of this year's expected profits, based on the current quarterly dividend, so there's plenty of room to increase the payout.

A once-in-a-generation investment opportunity?

Most experts agree that the accelerating adoption of AI has only just begun, and demand will only grow from here. Because generative AI automates many time-consuming and mundane tasks, it increases productivity, which leads to higher profits.

While estimates vary considerably, the impact of generative AI on the economy is expected to be between $2.6 trillion to $4.4 trillion over the coming decade, according to research compiled by McKinsey & Company, representing a once-in-a-generation opportunity. It's worth noting, however, that estimates have been increasing over time, so the actual impact may be higher as new applications for AI are created. Broadcom's extensive reach in technology circles gives the company the potential to grab an increasingly larger piece of the AI pie.

Over the past five years, Broadcom has been on fire, as revenue increased 126%, driving net income up 197%. This, in turn, has driven the stock price up 463% during the same period (as of this writing), more than five times the returns of the S&P 500. Furthermore, the stock has gained 93% over the past year alone, as its pivotal place in the AI ecosystem is boosting its results.

Broadcom currently trades for 33 times forward earnings, which is a premium compared to a multiple of 28 for the S&P 500. However, given its significant outperformance over the past five years, its clear that Broadcom is deserving of a premium.

Given the company's strong track record of results, pervasive reach, and prevailing secular tailwinds, I would argue that the evidence supports the case that Broadcom is a once-in-a-generation investment opportunity ahead of its 10-for-1 stock split. That said, I don't think it matters if you buy Broadcom before or after the stock split -- as long as you buy it.

Yahoo Finance,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/forget-nvidia-heres-another-spectacular-092100205.html,2024-06-30,09:21:00 UTC,"Forget Nvidia: Here's Another Spectacular Semiconductor Stock to Buy Right Now, According to Wall Street","I'm being facetious when I tell you to forget Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA). After all, how can you ignore a stock that soared nearly tenfold in just 18 months and now has a $3.1 trillion market cap, which accounts for 6.7% of the entire S&P 500 index? Not to mention, the company's chips are the driving force behind artificial intelligence (AI).

However, the incredible run in Nvidia stock made it quite expensive, even relative to its expected earnings a couple of years from now. Nvidia isn't the only chipmaker reaping the rewards of AI, so investors might find better value in other stocks in this space.

Micron Technology (NASDAQ: MU) is one to consider. The overwhelming majority of the analysts tracked by The Wall Street Journal give it the highest possible buy rating, with none recommending selling. Here's why.

Image source: Getty Images.

Micron is catching a tailwind from AI

Nvidia's graphics processing units (GPUs) are critical for AI development. However, memory chips are a key component of those GPUs. They basically give AI models short-term memory, storing data in a ready state where it can be instantly called upon either for training purposes or when a user queries a chatbot.

Micron makes the world's leading HBM3E (HBM stands for high-bandwidth memory) for the data center. HBM3E's architecture provides a higher bandwidth than previous generations of memory (like DDR), while occupying a smaller physical footprint that also consumes less energy. This means mountains of data can be transferred more quickly while reducing electricity costs. Both factors are top of mind for data center operators.

Micron's HBM3E is so efficient that Nvidia is using it in its latest GPUs, including in the new H200, which can inference AI models (ingest live data and make predictions) twice as fast as its flagship H100.

During the recent fiscal 2024 third quarter (ended May 30), Micron said its data center HBM solutions contributed $100 million in revenue. The company expects total HBM revenue to be in the hundreds of millions of dollars at the close of fiscal 2024 (ending Aug. 31), and several billions of dollars in fiscal 2025. In fact, all of Micron's supply is completely sold out for next year already.

But Micron's AI opportunity doesn't stop at the data center, because AI-enabled personal computers (PCs) require up to 80% more memory (DRAM) capacity than traditional PCs. Micron says Microsoft's new Copilot+ AI PC comes with a minimum DRAM content of 16GB, whereas the previous generation came with an 8GB option. Similarly, AI-enabled smartphones require up to double the memory capacity of their predecessors.

Story continues

These trends will lead to more money in the door for Micron.

Micron's revenue is soaring, thanks to AI

Micron generated $6.8 billion in revenue during Q3, representing year-over-year growth of 81%. That marked an acceleration from the prior quarter when revenue grew by 57%, which speaks to how quickly demand for AI is ramping up.

Beneath the surface of the headline number, the results were even more impressive. Micron's compute and networking (data center) business, which is the largest of its four segments, grew revenue by 85% in the last year. Its mobile segment expanded even faster, with revenue soaring by 94% as the world's leading smartphone manufacturers race to integrate AI into their flagship devices.

Micron also delivered a strong result at the bottom line. It generated $0.30 in earnings per share during Q3, which was a big swing from its $1.73 loss per share from the year-ago period. It was also above the high end of management's guidance of $0.24.

As I touched on earlier, supply of products like HBM3E is now sold out until the end of 2025, and those supply constraints give Micron the ability to charge higher prices. It translated to improved profitability in Q3, and that tailwind should persist for at least the next year.

Wall Street is very bullish on Micron stock

Micron stock is up 72% so far this year and trading near an all-time high, but that hasn't deterred Wall Street. The Wall Street Journal tracks 38 analysts covering the stock, and 27 give it the highest possible buy rating. A further seven are in the overweight (bullish camp), and two recommend holding. Although two analysts have assigned Micron an underweight (bearish) rating, none recommend outright selling.

Micron's fiscal year 2024 wraps up in August. Its final earnings result will be compromised by weakness at the start of the year, stemming from an inventory glut in its consumer-oriented segments. But analysts already turned their attention to fiscal 2025, when they expect Micron to deliver $9.06 in earnings per share -- based on its closing stock price of $142.36 on June 26, which places it at a forward price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio of just 15.7.

For perspective, the iShares Semiconductor ETF trades at a P/E ratio of 35.9 today, implying Micron stock will have to more than double within the next year just to trade in line with its peers in the chip industry (assuming Wall Street's earnings forecast is accurate). Plus, Nvidia trades at a forward P/E ratio of 46.6, which makes Micron stock look like an even better value.

Since Micron's HBM3E memory is a key component in many of Nvidia's latest GPUs, any investor who thinks Nvidia will do well should also consider adding Micron to their portfolio, especially at the current price.

Yahoo Finance,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/chipotle-no-brainer-buy-50-180000783.html,2024-06-30,18:00:00 UTC,Is Chipotle a No-Brainer Buy Right After Its 50-for-1 Stock Split? The Answer Might Surprise You.,"The time has finally come. On June 16, shares of Chipotle Mexican Grill (NYSE: CMG) underwent a closely watched and historic 50-for-1 stock split. The previous four-figure price tag of the stock is currently at about $65.

Management felt this was the right proposal, given how well the restaurant company's shares have been performing. They're up 44% in 2024, and in the past five years, have soared 348%.

Is this magnificent restaurant stock a no-brainer investment opportunity right after its 50-for-1 stock split?

No fundamental changes

Stock splits typically happen after a company's nominal share price gets too high. Of course, this is a good problem to have for Chipotle because it means the stock has done well for investors over the years. But by artificially cutting the price, the stock can be accessible to more investors.

Chipotle's outstanding share count expanded 50-fold to 1.4 billion. And the share price is now 1/50th what it was before this event. It's helpful to think of this situation as a pizza being cut into smaller slices.

It's really important to remember that from a fundamental perspective, nothing has changed with Chipotle. This is still the same business it was yesterday. Through its fast-casual stores, this company still sells Tex-Mex food like bowls and burritos.

Since the executive team first announced the stock split in March, shares have climbed 17%. Perhaps the anticipation of this happening is precisely what has driven even greater bullish sentiment from the market.

Curb your appetite

As we view the company and stock today to assess if Chipotle is a no-brainer investment opportunity, it's critical to consider the quality of the company. This is a stellar business.

The company continues to post strong financial results, despite ongoing macro headwinds. After revenue jumped 14.3% in 2023, it rose 14.1% in Q1 2024 (ended March 31). This was boosted by same-store sales growth of 7%, as well as the opening of 47 new restaurants.

Chipotle is extremely profitable, which is supported by its proven pricing power. In the past five years, the company's operating margin has averaged 11.5%. And from a store-level perspective, 27.5% of revenue turned into operating profit in the first quarter, an outstanding figure.

There's still a lot of growth to be achieved. Management sees the potential to have 7,000 stores open in North America one day, roughly double the current footprint. This goal is higher than the previous target of 6,000, so it shows you that the leadership team is extremely optimistic about Chipotle's long-term prospects to further penetrate its key market.

Story continues

All of these positive factors might make you believe that this stock is a no-brainer buying opportunity. However, consider just how high the expectations have gotten. It seems wild to me to pay a price-to-earnings ratio (P/E) of 70.1 for the shares of this business. There's no margin of safety for investors should the company post quarterly financial results that the market isn't pleased with for whatever reason.

Of course, unsustainable trends can last a lot longer than people might think. And this could be the case with Chipotle stock, as it has traded at a steep valuation for a while.

Not only do I think the stock should be avoided, but I’m also not comfortable calling this a no-brainer investment opportunity right now. Maybe if the P/E multiple dropped below 30, I'd adopt this view. This might not happen for a long time, though.

These companies launched splits to lower their share prices after the shares soared to high levels -- the idea is to make it easier for more people to invest without relying on fractional shares.

These players helped drive the S&P 500 higher in the first half of the year as investors welcomed the stock split news. Stock splits aren't share performance catalysts though, as they're just mechanical movements. So, investors who seize the opportunity to buy generally are making the move for a fundamental reason -- such as confidence in the company's future growth prospects.

Now, as we head into the second half of the year, you may be wondering which stock split players may continue their paths higher and represent the best long-term bets. Let's check out one to buy hand over fist, and one to avoid like the plague.

Image source: Getty Images.

Stock to buy: Nvidia

Nvidia already climbed more than 150% in the first half of the year thanks to its booming artificial intelligence (AI) business. The company sells the graphics processing units (GPUs) that power some of the most crucial AI tasks -- and Nvidia's GPUs are the fastest on the market. So, it's no surprise the company holds 80% share of the AI chip market.

The tech giant also sells a wide range of related AI products and services, including enterprise software -- available through all of the public cloud service providers. This makes access to Nvidia very easy for potential customers.

This has helped the company generate record revenue quarter after quarter, grow revenue and net income in the triple digits, and widen gross margin. In the most recent quarter, revenue reached $26 billion and gross margin came in at more than 78% -- from about 64% a year ago.

What makes me so optimistic about Nvidia in the second half and beyond? The company pledges to update its top performing chips on an annual basis, a strategy that should keep it ahead of rivals. As part of this, later this year Nvidia plans to launch its Blackwell architecture and chip -- a system laced with many innovations that could make it a game-changer.

All of this means Nvidia merits its valuation of 46 times forward earnings estimates, and the stock's gains this year and into the future may be far from over.

Stock to avoid: Chipotle

First, I'll start by saying Chipotle Mexican Grill (NYSE: CMG) isn't necessarily a sell or an avoid for every investor. This fast casual chain has progressively increased earnings over time, and its expansion strategy should keep that going. Chipotle's brand strength also may help it lift revenue over the long run too. So, if you're looking to diversify your portfolio and want to buy a solid restaurant stock, you may consider adding a few shares or if you're a Chipotle shareholder today, you might want to hold on to your position.

Story continues

But for the value investor, Chipotle is a stock to avoid, and here's why. The stock trades for 59 times forward earnings estimates, extremely high for the industry and high considering the source of Chipotle's growth. It's important to note that comparable restaurant sales growth has been in the mid-single digits -- increasing 7% in the first quarter of this year and 7.9% for the full year 2023. So Chipotle's growth mainly has come from adding on new restaurants -- it opened 271 last year.

Chipotle, now at about 3,500 locations, aims to double that to 7,000 in North America, and the company is expanding internationally too. It's fine to grow through expansion, but without stronger comparable sales increases, Chipotle doesn't look like a high-growth stock today, yet it's trading at growth stock prices.

Of course, over time, Chipotle shares still may have room to run as the company's new locations start adding to revenue. But, considering the hefty price tag for this stock, as we transition into the second half of the year, value investors should avoid this expensive player like the plague.

Yahoo Finance,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/avoid-social-security-tax-torpedo-160018318.html,2024-06-30,16:00:05 UTC,How to Avoid the Social Security 'Tax Torpedo',"A senior couple dealing with unexpected Social Security taxes, commonly referred to as the Social Security tax torpedo.

While retirees may be chagrined to discover that taxes don’t end when they leave the workforce, an unseen threat looms behind the U.S. tax code. The Social Security tax torpedo is as destructive as it sounds, blowing up the budgets of unsuspecting retired folks eagerly awaiting their first Social Security check. Having a clear understanding of your Social Security taxes could help you dodge this torpedo in retirement. Here’s what you need to know.

A financial advisor can help you create a financial plan to minimize your taxes in your golden years.

What Is Social Security Tax Torpedo?

The Social Security tax torpedo is a spike in taxes retirees can experience after receiving Social Security income. Specifically, 50% to 85% of your Social Security check may be taxable, depending on your income level and life circumstances. In addition, your Social Security income can increase your marginal tax rate, meaning the top portion of your income enters the next tax bracket. As a result, unsuspecting retirees can pay heavier taxes than anticipated, and their Social Security benefits provide less of a financial boost than expected.

Tax Torpedo Implications

The government bases your taxes in retirement on your modified adjusted gross income plus any nontaxable interest (usually from municipal bonds) and half of your Social Security benefits. The resulting sum is called your ‘combined income,’ which incurs different taxes depending on the amount and the filer’s status.

For instance, single filers with a combined income of $25,000 to $34,000 pay taxes on 50% of their benefits. An income above this amount results in taxes on 85% of the benefits. Likewise, those married filing jointly with combined incomes between $32,000 and $44,000 will pay taxes on 50% of their benefits. Any amount above this incurs taxes on 85% of the benefits.

Remember, the tax torpedo doesn’t mean you will lose 85% of your Social Security income taxes. Instead, you’ll owe your regular income tax rate on 85 cents of every dollar you receive from Social Security. In addition, your income tax rate isn’t the same across all your income because of how tax brackets work. The US tax code incurs progressive taxes on your income the higher it is.

For example, say you’re a single filer in 2023 with a total taxable income of $50,000 (putting you in the 22% tax rate for the income above $44,725). Your combined income is $35,000, and you receive $15,000 in Social Security benefits. You’re over the $34,000 combined income limit, meaning you’ll pay taxes on 85% of your Social Security benefits.

Story continues

This situation means applying your top marginal tax rate (22%) to 85% of your Social Security benefit ($12,750). So, your tax burden from Social Security is a $2,805 expense. If your combined income was $34,000 or less, only half your Social Security would be taxed, a $1,650 expense.

How to Avoid the Social Security Tax Torpedo

A senior calculating his taxes to avoid the Social Security tax torpedo.

Losing your hard-earned Social Security benefits to Uncle Sam isn’t a foregone conclusion. Here’s how to sidestep the Social Security tax torpedo while maximizing your financial wellness and quality of life:

Use a Roth IRA

Roth IRAs are retirement accounts where contributions are made with after-tax dollars, meaning you don’t get a tax deduction when you contribute. However, the distributions during retirement are tax-free. As a result, your Roth IRA income doesn’t count towards your taxable income, reducing the likelihood that you’ll pass the threshold that determines whether 50% or 85% of your Social Security benefit is taxed.

Live in a Tax-Friendly State

Thirteen states tax your Social Security check, adding to the federal tax burden. As a result, you can save on taxes by avoiding residency in the following states:

Colorado

Connecticut

Kansas

Minnesota

Missouri

Montana

Nebraska

New Mexico

North Dakota

Rhode Island

Utah

Vermont

Washington

Give Your IRA Income to Charity

Qualified charitable distributions (QCDs) allow you to donate money directly from your traditional IRA to charity. The government doesn’t count the first $100,000 of donations as taxable income. While doing so won’t directly affect your Social Security tax, it will lower your overall taxable income, potentially reducing the portion of your Social Security benefits subject to taxation. Remember, this advantage is solely for traditional IRAs.

Buy a Qualified Longevity Annuity Contract (QLAC)

A QLAC is a specialized annuity that provides a guaranteed income stream later in life. You can transfer $130,000 from a traditional IRA or 401(k) to a newly opened QLAC, reducing the required minimum distributions (RMDs) you’ll take from your retirement account. This way, the distributions from your 401(k) or IRA won’t increase your annual income as much, mitigating Social Security taxes.

Your QLAC has a delayed RMD age compared to traditional retirement accounts. While the government requires RMDs from a 401(k) or IRA at age 73, you can delay distributions from your QLAC until you’re 85. Remember, you will owe taxes from QLAC distributions the year you receive them.

Compare Your Income Level to Tax Brackets

Understanding the income thresholds for different tax brackets can help you plan withdrawals from retirement accounts. By staying within lower tax brackets, you may reduce the portion of your Social Security benefits subject to taxation.

Delay Social Security

Taxes on Social Security income can’t apply until you receive your benefits. Therefore, delaying Social Security can help you avoid additional taxation through your 60s. If you can work or survive on other income until age 70, you’ll reap two benefits: first, you’ll maximize your Social Security payment amount. Second, you’ll avoid paying taxes on Social Security. Plus, if you live on a traditional IRA or 401(k) during that time, you’ll reduce your RMDs, giving you more control over your income level in your 70s.

Consider speaking with a financial advisor if you're interested in building a tax-efficient retirement plan.

Bottom Line

A senior surprised by unexpected taxes commonly known as the Social Security tax torpedo.

Understanding and proactively addressing the possibility of a Social Security tax torpedo can increase your net income during retirement. By utilizing tools like Roth IRAs, charitable donations, and QLACs, you can create a more tax-efficient retirement.

Additionally, being mindful of how your income level relates to tax brackets and considering delaying Social Security can provide further avenues to optimize your financial well-being and quality of life in retirement. Consulting a financial advisor can be instrumental in tailoring these strategies to your specific circumstances, helping you maximize your hard-earned retirement benefits.

Tips for Avoiding the Social Security Tax Torpedo

Consulting a financial advisor is a crucial step in planning for retirement and avoiding the Social Security tax torpedo as you can get personalized guidance tailored to your specific financial situation, goals, and preferences. Finding a financial advisor doesn’t have to be hard. SmartAsset’s free tool matches you with up to three vetted financial advisors who serve your area, and you can have a free introductory call with your advisor matches to decide which one you feel is right for you. If you’re ready to find an advisor who can help you achieve your financial goals, get started now.

Planning during your working years makes a tax-efficient retirement more doable. However, if you’re already retired, you can still lower your taxes and set yourself up for a brighter financial future.

Keep an emergency fund on hand in case you run into unexpected expenses. An emergency fund should be liquid -- in an account that isn't at risk of significant fluctuation like the stock market. The tradeoff is that the value of liquid cash can be eroded by inflation. But a high-interest account allows you to earn compound interest. Compare savings accounts from these banks.

Yahoo Finance,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/euro-gains-french-voting-china-224810986.html,2024-07-01,04:58:05 UTC,"Euro Rallies After French Vote, Stock Futures Gain: Markets Wrap","(Bloomberg) -- The euro advanced with European stock-index futures on speculation Marine Le Pen’s far-right party will struggle to win an outright majority in French elections, easing investor concern that Europe’s second-largest economy was headed for a more radical policy shift.

Most Read from Bloomberg

Futures on French government bonds edged higher, while CAC 40 Index futures jumped after the first round of voting showed Le Pen’s National Rally in front of President Emmanuel Macron’s centrist alliance, albeit less comfortably than some polls projected. A very strong showing for her party would have increased the odds of expansive fiscal policy in France, whose deficit already exceeds what’s allowed under European Union rules.

Asian shares gained, with South Korea’s benchmark gaining alongside Japan’s Topix. China’s 10-year bond yield fell to a record amid pessimism about the domestic economy.

There is a sense of relief “that the far-right parties did not get the kind of majority that was feared,” Charu Chanana, a market strategist for Saxo Capital Markets in Singapore, told Bloomberg Television’s David Ingles and Stephen Engle.

In addition to French politics, investors will be looking to the European Central Bank for clues, she said, adding “there’s been some sense of stability for the euro zone economy after that first rate cut, but we certainly don’t look like we’re out of the woods yet.”

France’s second round of voting will be held on July 7. The French political world is now embarking on a period of horse-trading. In constituencies where three people qualified for the runoffs, the third-placed candidate can withdraw to boost the chances of another mainstream party defeating the far right.

Japan’s Tankan

While central banks in Europe have begun easing policy, the door was left open to an interest-rate increase in Japan later this month after data on Monday showed that confidence among Japan’s large manufacturers rose. The yield on the nation’s 10-year bond rose one basis point to 1.06%.

One in three economists surveyed by Bloomberg predicts a rate hike at the Bank of Japan’s next gathering. The yen dropped to the lowest level since 1986 last week, prompting some analysts to flag a heightened risk of a rate move as Governor Kazuo Ueda has pledged to watch the yen’s impact on inflation closely.

In corporate news, Boeing Co. agreed to buy back Spirit AeroSystems Holdings Inc. for $37.25 a share in an all-stock deal that values the supplier at $4.7 billion, unwinding a two-decade separation as the embattled US plane-maker tries to fix is manufacturing defects. The US Justice Department will charge the company with criminal fraud, leaving the firm to choose between pleading guilty or taking the risk of going to trial, according to people familiar with the matter.

A swath of data indicated the US biggest economy is cooling without lasting damage to consumers. US consumer sentiment declined by less than initially estimated on expectations inflationary pressures will moderate and the Fed’s preferred inflation gauge marked its smallest advance in six months. Treasury 10-year notes were little changed on Monday.

“Going into the second half, there’s a lot of election election uncertainty and we think the dollar will be the best risk-off hedge,” Alex Loo, foreign exchange and macro strategist at TD Securities, told Annabelle Droulers and Shery Ahn on Bloomberg Television. “We do like its appeal as a safe-haven currency.”

In commodities, oil edged higher as traders weighed China’s economic outlook and geopolitical risks in Europe and the Middle East. Gold was little changed.

Yahoo Finance,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/outperform-88-professional-fund-managers-210400950.html,2024-06-29,21:04:00 UTC,You Can Outperform 88% of Professional Fund Managers by Using This Simple Investment Strategy,"Professional fund managers are in charge of investing billions of dollars for investors. They're often highly educated, have years of investment experience, and get paid well for their skills and expertise. But the truth is most aren't worth the fees they charge.

It doesn't take an advanced degree or special insider knowledge to do better than the vast majority of actively-managed mutual funds. A simple strategy can beat about 88% of them. It's a strategy Warren Buffett famously bet half a million dollars on with the expectation it could beat any hedge fund manager over 10 years.

He won the bet.

All you need to do is buy an S&P 500 index fund, such as the Vanguard S&P 500 ETF (NYSEMKT: VOO), and you can expect better long-term returns than most active mutual funds.

Image source: Getty Images.

Why 88% of active large-cap funds can't beat a simple index fund

S&P Global publishes its SPIVA (S&P Indices Versus Active) scorecards twice a year. The scorecard compares the performance of active mutual funds (after fees) to relevant S&P benchmark indexes over periods of one, three, five, 10, and 15 years. It found that 88% of active large-cap funds failed to beat the S&P 500 over the last 15 years as of the end of 2023. Even when you look at a shorter three-year period, about 80% failed to beat the benchmark.

There are a couple of factors that lead to such dismal results for active funds as a group.

First, it's important to consider how the stock market works. There's always someone on either side of a transaction; for every buyer, there's a seller. And among large-cap stocks, the people buying and selling shares are mostly institutional investors. In other words, one fund manager is typically selling their shares to another fund manager. They can't both be right.

Since large institutions make up most of the market, the odds of outperforming the market as an active fund manager may be only a little better than 50/50. But the second factor severely diminishes the returns passed on to investors in actively-managed funds.

Fund managers, their teams, and the institutions they work for all require compensation. That means mutual fund investors have to pay fees. The most common fee is the expense ratio, which captures a portion of the assets under management. Those fees can climb well over 1%. That means the fund manager has to outperform the market by the fee they charge clients just to break even. And that's a lot harder than simply beating the market by a few basis points.

As a result, the percentage of actively-managed mutual funds that outperform the S&P 500 in any given year is only around 40%. And very few can consistently beat the market by enough every year to come out ahead in the long run.

Story continues

Reduce your ""cost of participation""

If you want to outperform the average investor, the key is reducing what Vanguard founder Jack Bogle called ""the cost of participation."" Those are the costs you have to pay to invest your money.

It's become easier and less expensive to invest over the 25-plus years since Bogle coined that term. Portfolio transaction costs are near zero with most brokerages waiving commissions on stock purchases. On average, expense ratios for mutual funds have declined considerably from the mid-90s too. Still, an investor should aim to keep costs as low as possible, and that means avoiding unnecessary fees.

Since active mutual funds cannot outperform their fees, on average, those fees should be deemed unnecessary. You can buy the Vanguard S&P 500 ETF and practically match the market return for a fee of just 0.03%, or $3 for every $10,000 you invest.

And while it's true some fund managers have outperformed their fees for a long time, identifying those funds beforehand is not so simple. What's more, there's no telling whether the results came from skill or luck, so you can't be certain the fund can continue its winning streak.

As a result, your best bet remains an S&P 500 index fund.

What makes the Vanguard S&P 500 ETF Buffett's top pick?

In Buffett's big bet against fund managers, he put his money in the Vanguard S&P 500 index fund. Berkshire Hathaway owns a small amount of the S&P 500 ETF in its equity portfolio as well. There are a few things that make it his top pick.

First, as mentioned, it has an expense ratio of 0.03%. That's one of the best in the industry.

Second, it has a very low tracking error. Tracking error tells you how consistently close (or wide) the ETF tracks the index it's benchmarked to. That can make a big difference for someone investing on a regular schedule. You want the fund to reflect the performance of the index, so your results match the results of the index over the long run. It's not worth sacrificing a low tracking error for a lower expense ratio, especially when the Vanguard fund is so cheap already.

There are many options to choose from, but the Vanguard S&P 500 ETF stands out as a top choice. It's a great option not just among other index funds but among all large-cap stock funds.

Yahoo Finance,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/1-magnificent-stock-turned-10-220600987.html,2024-06-30,22:06:00 UTC,"1 Magnificent Stock That Turned $10,000 Into $2.7 Million","The artificial intelligence (AI) boom has lifted Nvidia to new heights. The ""Magnificent Seven"" stock has soared 27,310% in the past 10 years, making it one of the world's most valuable companies.

But there's a much smaller business that has performed even better. I'm talking about Celsius (NASDAQ: CELH). This beverage stock has skyrocketed 27,360% in the past decade (as of June 25), turning a $10,000 investment into a jaw-dropping $2.7 million.

Let's take a closer look at Celsius' meteoric rise to becoming a $13-billion business today. Then by viewing things with a fresh perspective, investors can assess if the stock is a smart buying opportunity.

Energizing growth

If you see a stock that has skyrocketed as much as Celsius has, it's worth taking the time to figure out what factors led to such a strong performance. In this case, it shouldn't be a surprise that the key driver of Celsius' ascent has been incredible sales growth.

Behind only Red Bull and Monster Beverage, the business has become the third-largest energy drink seller in the U.S. In 2023, Celsius reported revenue of $1.3 billion. That figure was 102% higher than the year before. And it represented an impressive 25-fold increase from only five years ago.

While the broader non-alcoholic beverage industry might be extremely mature, the energy drink category is registering faster growth. Perhaps consumers aren't interested in drinking sugary beverages as much as they were 10 or 20 years ago. Or maybe there's simply a heightened focus on drinks that are supposedly healthier for you.

This is what Celsius aims to be. By marketing its products as functional beverages that have certain health benefits, it has steadily gained consumer mindshare. Any consumer-facing brand should strive to do just this.

Celsius has also benefited from getting its drinks in front of more customers. This means expanding its presence in various retail settings. The business is also finding tremendous success on Amazon, an extremely popular e-commerce site that gets billions of visitors each month.

And with the help of PepsiCo, which is Celsius' distribution partner both domestically and abroad, this company is in a favorable position to keep finding success.

Is it too late to buy Celsius stock?

Since hitting their all-time high in March of this year, Celsius shares have been nosediving, tanking 42% in less than five weeks. On May 28, Dara Mohsenian, a research analyst at Morgan Stanley, published a note that said the company's sales fell sequentially during the week ending May 18, causing Celsius' market share to dip slightly.

Story continues

But even after its monumental decline, I still believe Celsius is an overvalued stock. It trades at a price-to-earnings ratio of 61.6. That's a steep valuation to pay, particularly as sales are slowing down. And I think it gives prospective investors zero margin of safety.

Celsius is expected to increase revenue at an annualized clip of 31% between 2023 and 2026. This is a far cry from the triple-digit growth investors have probably become accustomed to.

What also worries me is that these projections could prove to be overly optimistic. Celsius has likely already taken advantage of the so-called low-hanging-fruit opportunity with its Pepsi deal. Moreover, the industry has virtually no barriers to entry. There's nothing stopping a well-funded entrepreneur from starting his or her own energy drink business, which consumers could flock to.

Celsius has undoubtedly been a fantastic investment in the past decade, turning a small sum into nearly $3 million. But the stock doesn't look like a smart buying opportunity today.

Don’t miss this second chance at a potentially lucrative opportunity

Ever feel like you missed the boat in buying the most successful stocks? Then you’ll want to hear this.

On rare occasions, our expert team of analysts issues a “Double Down” stock recommendation for companies that they think are about to pop. If you’re worried you’ve already missed your chance to invest, now is the best time to buy before it’s too late. And the numbers speak for themselves:

Amazon: if you invested $1,000 when we doubled down in 2010, you’d have $21,765 !*

Apple: if you invested $1,000 when we doubled down in 2008, you’d have $39,798 !*

Netflix: if you invested $1,000 when we doubled down in 2004, you’d have $363,957!*

Right now, we’re issuing “Double Down” alerts for three incredible companies, and there may not be another chance like this anytime soon.

After all, more stocks mean more diversification. In this vein, The Motley Fool suggests holding at least 25 different stocks at any given time.

Sometimes, though, it's eye-opening to think about which stocks you would buy if you could only buy a small number of them. Such an exercise forces you to identify the market's most promising risk-versus-reward scenarios.

With that as the backdrop, here's a rundown of the three names I would buy this year if I only had room and money to add another three tickers to my portfolio. (These picks, of course, only make sense for you if they improve your portfolio's diversification rather than making it less balanced.)

1. MercadoLibre

MercadoLibre (NASDAQ: MELI) is often referred to as the Amazon of Latin America. It's not an unfair comparison, but it is an incomplete one.

MercadoLibre is also akin to eBay, Shopify, and PayPal. Its wide lineup of tools has helped the company become South America's premier name in brick-and-mortar and e-commerce technology. The company facilitated nearly $41 billion in payments in the first quarter of this year while also serving as the middleman for $11.4 billion worth of sales of goods and services. Its subsequent revenue of $4.3 billion during the quarter was up 36% year over year, driving a 71% improvement in net income.

And this is still just the beginning. In many ways, South America is now where North America was roughly 20 years ago, when high-speed internet was still relatively new and smartphones were still only an idea. In the same way that Amazon was in the right place at the right time with the right business model, MercadoLibre is positioned to capitalize on the region's brewing mobile-technology boom.

And it is booming. Market researcher GSMA says 75 million people in South America became mobile internet users just within the past five years, while Canalys reports the region's smartphone shipments surged 26% year over year in the first quarter following the fourth quarter's growth of 20%.

Even so, only 65% of the continent's population currently uses a wireless broadband-capable smartphone. The rest are coming around, though. GSMA believes South America's mobile internet penetration rate will grow to 72% by 2030, with most of those connections likely to be ultra-high-speed 5G by that point.

Because e-commerce grows in step with consumers' growing ability to be online, Americas Market Intelligence is looking for Latin America's e-commerce market to grow 24% this year, then by another 21% next year, and then match that pace again in 2026.

Story continues

MercadoLibre is arguably better positioned than any other name to capitalize on this growth.

2. Alphabet

Few investors would deny that Google parent Alphabet (NASDAQ: GOOG) (NASDAQ: GOOGL) is still a force to be reckoned with. But plenty of people also seem to presume its highest-growth glory days are in the past. The search engine industry is fully matured, after all, and crowded with credible competition like Microsoft's artificial intelligence powered Bing.

If you don't think Alphabet has any growth engines left to rev, however, think again. Its cloud computing venture is an example. While still only a fraction of the size of Amazon's and Microsoft's cloud businesses, this segment still produced revenue growth of 28% during the first quarter of the year.

Better yet, Google Cloud is now consistently and meaningfully profitable, generating $900 million worth of operating profits in the three-month stretch ending in March. Mordor Intelligence expects the worldwide cloud computing market will grow at an annualized pace of more than 16% through 2029, so Alphabet's cloud segment holds tremendous profit promise.

Ratings agency Nielsen says the company's YouTube service is more watched within the United States than conventional streaming services like Netflix or Walt Disney's Hulu and Disney+. YouTube's top line improved 21% year over year in first quarter, as Alphabet continues to figure out how to make it a destination platform within the highly fragmented and often-unprofitable streaming space.

Google Search's advertising business might not be as stagnant as some suspect, too. Its ad revenue grew more than 14% during the first quarter of the year, helped by the search engine's sustained reach. GlobalStats says Google still handles about 90% of the world's web searches, as it has for well over a decade.

So Alphabet looks as strong as it's ever been. The fact that shares are rallying despite plenty of well-voiced worries should tell you everything you need to know about what investors see for its foreseeable future.

3. Bank of America

I would round out my limited number of stock picks for 2024 with a new position in Bank of America (NYSE: BAC).

It's not an easy name to get exciting about owning right now. The stock has underperformed since early 2022, dragged down by the economic malaise caused by sky-high inflation. Although high interest rates generally widen banks' profit margins, the subsequent trade-offs of that dynamic are diminished demand for loans as well as a greater number of loan defaults and delinquencies.

BofA's provision for loan losses grew to $1.3 billion in the first quarter, while net interest income slipped 3% to $14 billion, dragging per-share profits down from $0.94 in the first quarter of last year to $0.83 this time around. Other business lines like corporate banking and investment management are also running into headwinds.

Largely lost in all the noise, however, is that nothing about the banking industry's current challenges is new. This is a highly (and predictably) cyclical business tethered to an equally predictably cyclical economy.

We do not know exactly when inflation will finally abate or when the global economy will perk up again. We do know, however, we want to be positioned in BofA before it becomes clear that this recovery is happening. Like most stocks, this one tends to move predictively rather than reactively.

In the meantime, you're plugging into a ticker that's paying a healthy, reliable dividend. Although you can certainly find stocks with a bigger dividend yield than Bank of America's current forward-looking yield of a little more than 2.4%, this big bank is protecting its business and balance sheet in a way that ensures it will be able to continue funding its dividend payout as well as raise it.

Its annualized dividend payment of $0.96 per share is less than one-third of this year's expected per-share earnings of $3.25, and even relatively less than next year's estimate of $3.59. That's a nice cushion for anyone seeking dependable investment income.

Yahoo Finance,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/boeing-agrees-buy-spirit-aero-224442909.html,2024-07-01,04:45:11 UTC,Boeing to Buy Spirit Aero for $4.7 Billion in Stock Deal,"(Bloomberg) -- Boeing Co. agreed to buy back Spirit AeroSystems Holdings Inc. for $37.25 a share in an all-stock deal that values the supplier at $4.7 billion, unwinding a two-decade separation as the embattled US planemaker tries to fix is manufacturing defects.

Most Read from Bloomberg

The total transaction value is about $8.3 billion, including Spirit’s last reported net debt, according to a statement early on Monday. Rival Airbus SE will also take over parts of Spirit that make parts for its operations, and the European planemaker will pay a nominal price of $1 for the assets, while receiving $559 million in compensation, according to a separate release.

“We believe this deal is in the best interest of the flying public, our airline customers, the employees of Spirit and Boeing, our shareholders and the country more broadly,” Boeing Chief Executive Officer Dave Calhoun said in the statement.

The complex, three-way transaction reunites Boeing with an operation that it spun off in 2005 as part of a broader push to trim costs and outsource assets. The move to take Spirit back in-house came in the wake of the near catastrophic accident on Jan. 5 in which a fuselage that had been assembled by Spirit lost a door-shaped panel during flight. That mishap triggered a chain reaction at Boeing, which has seen a wholesale management shakeup, federal investigations, to scrutiny of to federal investigations.

The price that Boeing is paying is 30% above Spirit’s closing stock price on February 29, the day before the companies confirmed they were in merger talks.

Airbus said it entered a “binding term sheet agreement” with Spirit that will see the planemaker take on facilities that make A350 fuselage sections in Kinston, North Carolina, and St. Nazaire in France. It will also seek to buy the A220 wing and mid-fuselage production in Belfast, Northern Ireland, and Casablanca, Morocco, as well as A220 pylon manufacturing at Spirit’s headquarters, it said.

The transaction is set to close in the middle of next year. Boeing said it’s taking over “substantially all Boeing-related commercial operations,” as well as additional commercial, defense and aftermarket operations.

The deal struck after months of negotiations comes as Boeing approaches another milestone, a settlement with the US Justice Department that would potentially involve pleading guilty to criminal fraud in relation to two crashes involving the 737 Max aircraft that occurred in rapid succession in 2018 and 2019.

Story continues

The US government plans to charge Boeing, leaving the planemaker to choose between pleading guilty or taking the risk of going to trial, according to people familiar with the matter said on Sunday.

The effort to buy back Spirit will likely be welcomed by US aviation regulators concerned about manufacturing quality lapses as the companies deal with massive worker turnover following the pandemic. But the tie-up and dissolution of Spirit would also need to be approved by Pentagon and US antitrust regulators increasingly concerned about consolidating aerospace and defense manufacturing.

The Boeing transaction, once completed, will reunite assets that for decades once sat under one roof, bringing together thousands of workers and decades of shared expertise. It also brings a longtime former Boeing leader back to the company as directors hunt for a new leader, with Calhoun set to step down at the end of the year.

Spirit Aero CEO Pat Shanahan was a longtime Boeing executive steeped in factory operations, known for helping turn around the 787 Dreamliner after a troubled start. He’s considered a potential contender to succeed Calhoun in Boeing’s top role.

Spirit has faced growing financial pressure and scrutiny alongside Boeing after the door-shaped panel on a 737 Max 9 model blew out minutes after takeoff. Shipments of 737 fuselages have plummeted as Boeing steps up its inspections in Kansas and back at home near Seattle, and declined to accept aircraft structures with missing components or incomplete work.

For Boeing, the deal brings a key supplier for the 737, 787 Dreamliner and other commercial jets back in-house at a time when the company is feeling the financial strain from the slowed-down output. Boeing lost about $4 billion in cash in the first quarter and is set to bleed a similar amount in the current three months of the year. The company’s credit rating is hovering one level above speculative grade, and management is keen to avoid slipping into junk territory.

Yahoo Finance,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/survey-bank-of-america-younger-and-older-wealthy-investors-163053034.html,2024-06-30,16:30:53 UTC,Survey details 'stark differences' between younger and older wealthy investors,"Bank of America Private Bank’s biennial survey of wealthy Americans revealed a generational divide in the perceived greatest opportunities for asset investment and growth.

“What we found was some stark differences in approaches to investing and mindset toward overall investing,” Michael Pelzar, head of investments at Bank of America Private Bank, told Yahoo Finance.

Market research company Escalent surveyed 1,007 high-net-worth Americans on behalf of Bank of America Private Bank. The respondents, who were divided into a younger cohort (ages 21 to 43) and an older cohort (44 and older), had a minimum of $3 million in investable assets apart from their primary residence.

Here's what Bank of America discovered about the younger investors surveyed:

47% of the younger cohort's portfolios are invested in stocks and bonds. That's much lower than the older cohort (74%).

More younger investors are invested in alternative assets than older investors, and almost all of the younger cohort (93%) said they plan to allocate more to alternatives in the next few years.

Nearly half (49%) of the young cohort own cryptocurrencies, and 38% expressed some interest. Behind real estate, this cohort ranked crypto as the top area for opportunity.

45% of the younger cohort own physical gold as an asset, and another 45% said they are interested in owning it.

Differences in financial outlooks drove the disparities in investment allocations and where investors perceive opportunities to be.

Notably, over 70% of younger wealthy investors no longer think it's possible to achieve above-average investment returns by investing exclusively in a mix of stocks and bonds. In contrast, only 28% of older investors share that view.

Bank of America

Younger investors' skepticism over traditional investments comes as the stock market has ripped higher in 2024. As Myles Udland wrote this week, the S&P 500 (^GSPC) is up 42% since the beginning of 2023, pacing an annualized rate of return near 26%, or almost three times the average 10% yearly return of the index over time.

However, Pelzar saw this difference in viewpoint as “somewhat understandable,” citing the turbulence the younger generation has experienced in their investing lives.

“The younger generation has seen in their investing lives two market crashes … and then over the course of the last few years, they’ve seen an increasing correlation between stocks and bonds,” Pelzar said. “And so that’s really colored their thinking around how they need to allocate assets in order to generate the returns they look for.”

The survey revealed that the younger cohort focused their asset allocation on alternatives, and many expressed plans to allocate even more to these investments in the next few years.

Pelzar said this projected increase is “largely reflective” of the younger cohort’s thoughts on the growth opportunities in the market. Because some of the alternative asset classes are less liquid, Pelzar said this implies that the younger generation is taking a longer-term view.

“You see a much different profile between those two different cohorts, and I think that indicates lessons learned or things we need to be thinking about in terms of the investment landscape going forward,” he said.

Yahoo Finance,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/2-unstoppable-dividend-stocks-buy-094000300.html,2024-06-30,09:40:00 UTC,2 Unstoppable Dividend Stocks to Buy if There's a Stock Market Sell-Off,"Dividend stocks offer a great way to add cash to your portfolio and help you compound your overall returns with time. Whether you use that dividend money to add to your portfolio or cash it out, these types of stocks can help you diversify the types of businesses you own shares in.

When it comes to investing in dividend stocks, you need to make sure the companies you buy have a strong underlying business and balance sheet that will support and help grow the dividends being paid out. A top dividend stock will also have a history of maintaining and raising its dividend in a wide range of market environments.

On that note, here are two top dividend stocks to consider for your portfolio. Each performs well, whether the bull market continues or bearish investor sentiment returns. If the bear market does return, these stocks have proven over the decades to be safe ones to hold.

1. Johnson & Johnson

Johnson & Johnson (NYSE: JNJ) has paid out and raised its dividend every single year for 62 years and counting. That places the pharmaceutical giant in a very select group of companies that have earned the moniker Dividend King.

J&J boasts a forward dividend yield of 3.4%, which is more than twice the average yield among S&P 500 stocks. Looking back over the last decade, Johnson & Johnson's dividend has increased an average of 6% annually. Its payout ratio is a very manageable 30%.

J&J's dividend helps to make up for the stock's relatively weak stock performance over the last several years. The weak stock performance also somewhat helps explain the higher-than-average yield. The stock is down based on several factors, but one of the biggest is ongoing litigation and potential multi-billion liabilities related to its talc products. The company has roughly $26 billion in cash on its balance sheet to help manage these ongoing lawsuits and eventually pay settlements while also maintaining its commitment to shareholders.

Investing in Johnson & Johnson also means putting cash into a company that has been in business for 138 years, and is one of the top pharmaceutical companies in the world by revenue. Over the trailing 12 months, the company has brought in over $17 billion in profits on about $86 billion in revenue. It's also generated approximately $24 billion in levered free cash flow looking back over the last 12 months.

Last year, J&J spun off its slower-growing consumer healthcare product segment into a company called Kenvue. The remaining two divisions -- pharmaceuticals and medical devices -- are faster growing and should help J&J boost its growth efforts in the coming years. The company has returned approximately 60% of free cash flow to investors over the last five years, while 65% of sales come from products in which it controls the top or second global market share position.

In the short term, this is likely not a business for growth-oriented investors. However, long-term investors seeking a company that generates steady financial gains from a broad portfolio of valuable pharmaceuticals and medical devices may find Johnson & Johnson poses a compelling investment opportunity. With its stock price underperforming, Johnson & Johnson's storied dividend history makes the business an attractive selection for income-seeking investors. When its underlying issues, including expensive litigation finally get resolved, share prices are likely to rise.

2. Coca-Cola

Coca-Cola (NYSE: KO) boasts a dividend yield of around 3% and has faithfully raised its dividend every year for 62 years as well. The beverage giant doesn't generate massive stock price gains these days, but its dividend and share price increases have helped deliver a total return of 46% over the last five years and over 108% in the trailing 10-year period.

Founded in 1886, the company now manages one of the largest beverage operations in the world. Coca-Cola controls roughly 46% of the soft drink market in the U.S., one of its largest markets.

Over the trailing 12 months, Coca-Cola has delivered profits of about $11 billion on revenue of $46 billion. It's maintained a profit margin of around 23%, an exceptional figure in an industry where margins are historically razor-thin. The company has a payout ratio of about 74%, which is relatively high but still quite manageable. Its dividend has grown an average of 5% annually over the past decade.

Just in the past 12 months, the company has brought in operating cash flow of about $12 billion, with levered free cash flow of approximately $11 billion. Currency headwinds and a fluctuating macro environment have impacted the company's growth in the last few years, but its commitment to its dividend and the strength of its balance sheet remain a testament to the resilience of this business.

Long-term buy-and-hold investors looking for steady portfolio growth and dividends can find a lot to love about Coca-Cola.

Yahoo Finance,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/a-fintech-collapse-is-rippling-through-a-small-corner-of-the-banking-world-143054499.html,2024-06-30,14:30:54 UTC,A fintech collapse is rippling through a small corner of the banking world,"The unraveling of fintech upstart Synapse is rippling through a small corner of the banking world, leaving thousands of customers without access to their money and a mystery about millions of dollars that went missing.

Four small US banks have some of the money. No one is sure where the rest went.

The saga surrounding the bankruptcy of Synapse, a 10-year-old fintech firm, puts a new spotlight on how loose webs of partnerships between venture-backed upstarts and FDIC-backed lenders can go so wrong.

Regulators are more closely scrutinizing these relationships and warning various banks to tighten their controls when working with fintech firms.

Earlier this month, the Federal Reserve slapped one of Synapse’s partner banks with an enforcement action that identified risk management weaknesses surrounding such partnerships.

'Banking as a service'

Synapse was part of a wave of new fintech firms that emerged in the aftermath of the 2008 financial crisis as Silicon Valley-style digital banking upstarts promised to shake up the world of traditional finance.

In just a decade it became a major middleman between dozens of fintech companies and community banks by offering what it called ""banking as a service.""

It provided digital banking outfits like Mercury, Dave (DAVE), and Juno with access to checking accounts and debit cards they could offer their customers. It was able to do this by partnering with FDIC-backed banks that in return got a new source of deposits and fee revenue.

The traditional lenders that partnered with Synapse included Evolve Bank & Trust, American Bank, AMG National Trust, and Lineage Bank, all small banks when compared with giants like JPMorgan Chase (JPM) or Bank of America (BAC).

The largest was Evolve, which had roughly $1.5 billion in assets at the end of the first quarter.

The pitch that Synapse effectively gave to these smaller banks was ""we’ll bring in the deposits; you don’t have to do much,"" according to Jason Mikula, an independent fintech consultant who publishes a weekly newsletter and has followed Synapse.

""This turned out not to be accurate, in my opinion,"" Mikula added.

The problems surfaced shortly after Synapse filed for bankruptcy in April when it could not reach an agreement with Evolve on a settlement of funds.

Three weeks into the bankruptcy proceedings, Synapse cut off Evolve's access to its technology system. That, in turn, forced Evolve and the other partner banks to freeze customer accounts.

Both parties blamed each other as the culprit.

""Synapse’s abrupt shutdown of essential systems without notice and failure to provide necessary records needlessly jeopardized end users by hindering our ability to verify transactions, confirm end user balances, and comply with applicable law,"" Evolve said in a statement.

Story continues

Synapse CEO Sankaet Pathak rebuked this claim, accusing Evolve of having the means to settle a deficit yet delaying the return of customer funds.

""The debtor has been forced to play a perverse game of 'whack-a-mole' with unreasonable demands from Evolve as conditions to unfreezing the depositor accounts, all while the depositors suffer lack of access to their funds,"" Pathak stated in court documents last month.

The end result is that thousands of fintech customers lost access to their money.

“Synapse’s bankruptcy has left tens of thousands of end-users of financial technology platforms that were customers of Synapse stranded without access to their funds,” Jelena McWilliams, the court-appointed trustee to Synapse and a former FDIC chair, wrote in a letter last week to the heads of five federal banking regulators.

There was another problem: No one seemed to know where all of the money was.

McWilliams in early June said there was a shortfall of $85 million, with the four banks only accounting for $180 million of the $265 million belonging to end users.

More recently she said the range of the shortfall was $65 million to $96 million.

Some money has been paid back to customers. McWilliams said on June 21 that more than $100 million ""has been distributed by certain of the partner banks.""

Blind spots

Bank regulators have been concerned for some time about the partnerships between Silicon Valley-style digital startups and FDIC-backed banks.

Acting Comptroller of the Currency Michael Hsu used a September 2023 speech to discuss the potential blind spots for regulators as these relationships become more blurry.

“Banks and tech firms, in an effort to provide a ‘seamless’ customer experience, are teaming up in ways that make it more difficult for customers, regulators, and the industry to distinguish between where the bank stops and where the tech firm starts,” Hsu said in the speech.

Last June, regulators issued final joint guidance on how lenders should handle these relationships.

These partnerships are not yet widespread across the entire banking industry, even though the use of this model is accelerating while banks of all sizes seek ways to attract deposits and earn more revenue.

Fewer than 2% of US banks used the banking-as-a-service model in 2023, according to S&P Global Market Intelligence.

But regulators are nonetheless getting more aggressive about calling out such relationships. The banking-as-a-service model accounted for 13.5% of public enforcement actions from regulators in 2023, according to S&P.

In January, the FDIC issued a consent order to one of Synapse’s partner banks, Franklin, Tenn.-based Lineage, that identified weaknesses related to its banking-as-a-service program and ordered the bank to come up with a plan for how to achieve an ""orderly termination"" with significant fintech partners.

The next month, New York City-based Piermont Bank; Attica, Ohio-based Sutton Bank; and Martinsville, Va.-based Blue Ridge Bank received consent orders from regulators related to alleged deficiencies in their banking-as-a-service business.

Then, earlier this month, the Fed issued an enforcement action against Evolve, saying that examinations conducted in 2023 ""found that Evolve engaged in unsafe and unsound banking practices by failing to have in place an effective risk management framework"" for its partnerships with fintech companies.

Regulators asked Evolve to improve its policies and risk management practices ""by implementing appropriate oversight and monitoring of those relationships."" They also noted that the action was ""independent of the bankruptcy proceedings regarding Synapse.""

A spokesperson for Evolve said the recent order was ""similar to orders received by others in the industry"" and ""does not affect our existing business, customers, or deposits.""

The bank counts Affirm (AFRM), Mastercard (MA), and Stripe as notable fintech partnerships on its website.

It has also in the past partnered with two crypto firms that went bankrupt, FTX and BlockFi, as well as Bytechip, a financial services firm had its accounts with Evolve frozen late last year on the allegation it violated federal law by laundering money for fraudsters.

To add to its recent challenges, Evolve said this past Wednesday that some customer data was illegally spread on the dark web as a result of ""a cybersecurity incident involving a known cybercriminal organization.""

""Evolve has engaged the appropriate law enforcement authorities to aid in our investigation and response efforts,"" the bank said. ""This incident has been contained, and there is no ongoing threat.""

Yahoo Finance,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/prediction-could-best-performing-value-101100270.html,2024-06-30,10:11:00 UTC,Prediction: These Could Be the Best-Performing Value Stocks Through 2030,"The S&P 500 is near an all-time high, but not all stocks are performing quite so well. If you look closely, there are still some excellent bargains in the stock market, especially if you look beyond the high-growth tech stocks making most of the headlines. With that in mind, here are three value investments you can make right now. I own all three in my own portfolio and am quite confident they'll be stellar performers for patient investors.

3 Value stocks that could outperform the market through 2030

Without further delay, here are three value stocks that could outperform the market for the remainder of the decade, and some reasons why.

1. Starbucks

Coffee giant Starbucks (NASDAQ: SBUX) has had a rough 2024. The company reported a surprising decline in same-store sales in the first quarter, as well as a 6% decline in customer traffic, and the stock took a nosedive. Even after a bit of a rebound, Starbucks trades for more than 25% below its 52-week high.

Despite the poor stock performance, it's important to realize that the issues are due to temporary headwinds, such as pressure on consumer discretionary spending. Plus, Starbucks has been doing an even better job than planned when it comes to making supply chains more efficient, expecting $4 billion in savings over the next four years.

2. Realty Income

Realty Income (NYSE: O) is one of the leading real estate investment trusts, or REITs. If you aren't familiar with its business, Realty Income owns more than 15,400 properties in the U.S. and Europe and is designed to produce predictable and growing rental income over time.

The stock is down by about 35% from its all-time high (reached just before the COVID-19 pandemic), but it's important to realize the business is doing fine. REITs are highly sensitive to rising interest rates, and Realty Income -- which has a strong history of market-beating returns for the past three decades -- could be a big winner as rates normalize. Realty Income is one of the largest investments in my own stock portfolio, and one that I plan to hold for decades to come.

3. Vanguard Small Cap Value ETF

Two of the most undervalued groups of stocks right now are small caps and value stocks, and the Vanguard Small Cap Value ETF (NYSEMKT: VBR) lets you invest in both of them, without too much exposure to any single company.

Small caps are trading for their lowest price-to-book valuation compared to the S&P 500 in more than 25 years. And over the past decade, growth stocks as a group have outperformed value stocks by a staggering 168 percentage points.

Story continues

There are some solid arguments in favor of these types of stocks right now. For one thing, the last time the small cap valuation gap was this wide, they ended up outperforming the S&P 500 for more than a decade. And if interest rates start to fall, they could make borrowing costs lower (value stocks are more likely to use debt than growth) and could also cause consumer spending activity to accelerate.

Remember the goal of value investing

As a final thought, keep in mind that value investing is a long-term practice. I have absolutely no idea what these stocks will do over the next few months or for the rest of 2024, and neither does anyone else. But these are three excellent investments that look like excellent values for long-term investors right now, and I'm quite confident that investors with a time horizon of five years or more will be glad they bought at the current levels.

These pipelines transport natural gas, refined petroleum products, crude oil, condensate, CO2, renewable fuels, and other products, while the terminals store and handle commodities like gasoline, diesel, jet fuel, chemicals, metals, and ethanol.

Kinder Morgan has maintained dividend payments for 14 consecutive years and increased them for the past 6 years. The company pays a quarterly dividend of $0.2875 per share, or $1.15 annually, yielding 5.81%.

Over the past twelve months, Kinder Morgan generated $15.28 billion in revenue and $2.45 billion in net income.

Yahoo Finance,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/boeing-announces-purchase-spirit-aerosystems-050708683.html,2024-07-01,05:07:08 UTC,Boeing announces purchase of Spirit AeroSystems for $4.7 billion in stock,"ARLINGTON, Va. (AP) — Boeing announced plans to aquire Spirit AeroSystems for $4.7 billion in an all-stock transaction for the manufacturing firm, which already was part of the aerospace company's manufacturing chain.

Boeing, located in Arlington, Virginia, announced the purchase in a statement late Sunday.

The acquisition's equity value of $4.7 billion is $37.25 per share, while the total value of the deal is around $8.3 billion, which includes Spirit’s last reported net debt, the aerospace company said.

Spirit, located in Wichita, Kansas, manufactures key parts for Boeing aircraft. Spirit also announced the acquisition on its website and social media.

“We believe this deal is in the best interest of the flying public, our airline customers, the employees of Spirit and Boeing, our shareholders and the country more broadly,” Boeing President and CEO Dave Calhoun said in the statement.

Boeing previously owned Spirit and the aerospace company said bringing the supplier back into the Boeing fold would improve plane quality and safety, which has come under increasing scrutiny by regulators, Congress and airlines.

“By reintegrating Spirit, we can fully align our commercial production systems, including our Safety and Quality Management Systems, and our workforce to the same priorities, incentives and outcomes — centered on safety and quality,"" Calhoun said.

The purchase of Spirit would reverse a longtime Boeing strategy of outsourcing key work on its passenger planes. That approach has been criticized as problems at Spirit disrupted production and delivery of popular Boeing jetliners including 737s and 787s.

Concerns about safety came to a head after the Jan. 5 blowout of a panel on an Alaska 737 Max 9 at 16,000 feet (4,876 meters) over Oregon. The Federal Aviation Administration soon after announced increased oversight of Boeing and Spirit.

The Justice Department said in a May court filing that Boeing violated terms of a 2021 settlement allowing the company to avoid prosecution for actions leading up to two deadly crashes involving the company’s 737 Max jetliners more than five years ago.

The Justice Department is pushing Boeing to plead guilty to criminal fraud in connection with two deadly plane crashes involving its 737 Max jetliners, according to several people who heard federal prosecutors detail a proposed offer Sunday.

Boeing has until the end of the week to accept or reject the offer, which includes the giant aerospace company agreeing to an independent monitor who would oversee its compliance with anti-fraud laws, they said.","ARLINGTON, Va.

Yahoo Finance,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/walgreens-stock-collapses-weak-outlook-091100390.html,2024-06-30,09:11:00 UTC,Walgreens Stock Collapses on Weak Outlook. Is Now the Time to Buy?,"Share prices of Walgreens Boots Alliance (NASDAQ: WBA) plunged following the June 27 release of its fiscal third-quarter earnings report, with the stock having one of its worst days on record. The stock price has now fallen more than 53% since the start of 2024.

Let's look at Walgreens' most recent quarterly report, why the stock plummeted, and whether now is the time to buy.

Reduced guidance, store closures, and new plan

For its fiscal Q3 (ended in May), Walgreens saw its revenue rise 2.6% year over year to $36.4 billion. However, adjusted earnings per share (EPS) fell 36.5% to $0.63. U.S. retail pharmacy sales rose 2.3% year over year, with same-store sales up 3.5%. Comparable pharmacy sales were up 5.7%, while comparable retail sales were down 2.3%. Adjusted operating income plunged 47.9% year over year to $501 million, hurt by weak retail sales and pharmacy reimbursement pressures.

International sales rose 2.8% year over year. Boots UK sales grew 1.6%, with retail same-store sales up 6% and pharmacy same-store sales up 5.8%. Adjusted operating income slid 15.8% year over year to $175 million.

Revenue from its U.S. healthcare segment rose 7.6% year over year to $2.1 billion, with adjusted earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization (EBITDA) of $23 million, an improvement from negative $113 million a year ago. VillageMD revenue grew 7% year over year, while Shields revenue jumped 24%.

Gross margins fell to 17.8% from 18.6% a year ago. Gross margins in its U.S. retail pharmacy business fell to 17.7% from 19.1%. This shows how the company continues to get squeezed from pharmacy benefit managers over drug prices.

Walgreens generated negative $314 million in operating cash flow through the first nine months of the year and negative $1.4 billion in free cash flow. It ended the quarter with $8.9 billion in debt and $703 million in cash.

Looking ahead, the company reduced its fiscal full-year adjusted EPS outlook to $2.80 to $2.95 from a prior forecast of $3.20 to $3.35. Management expects the challenging consumer environment and muted script volume growth it is seeing to continue into 2025.

As a result, the company plans to close a ""significant portion"" of its 8,700 U.S. locations over the next three years, with it set to examine about 25% of its unprofitable locations. The company also said it will make investments to improve customer and patient experience, such as accelerating its digital and omnichannel offerings, building its loyalty program, and reducing the number of brands and SKUs on its shelves.

Story continues

The company also plans to reduce its stake in VillageMD and no longer be its majority owner. However, it plans to keep its positions in Shields and Boots UK.

The company also remains in talks with pharmacy benefit managers (PBMs) and health issuers about creating a better reimbursement system that will help stabilize its pharmacy margins and ensure fair payment.

Image source: Getty Images.

Is this dip an opportunity to buy the stock?

Reimbursement rate pressures that continue to hurt Walgreens' margins and lower profitably remain its biggest problem. Shifting to a cost-plus model, where it would get additional payments when it can help slow the inflationary costs on drug prices, would greatly benefit the company. It would also help relieve the constant drug reimbursement pressure it has seen year in and year out.

However, while Walgreens is actively working with PBMs and other payers to change the model, this won't happen overnight. And the PBMs have clearly shown that they hold the upper hand.

In the meantime, it is a good idea to sell off some of its VillageMD stake, as this was a failed investment idea that stemmed from the company's previous management team. Closing unprofitable stores is also the right move. Walgreen's balance sheet is loaded with debt, so paying off debt and returning to positive free cash flow is a priority.

Trading at about a 4 times forward price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio, Walgreens finds itself in the bargain bin. However, its debt load, lack of operating cash flow generation, and weakening operating performance are reasons the stock is trading at the current levels.

WBA PE Ratio (Forward) Chart

For patient investors, Walgreens is worth taking a chance on at current levels. The stock is cheap, and the company's new CEO is now looking to make his imprint on the pharmacy giant. Given its valuation, if he can stabilize its pharmacy margins and improve its cash flow profile, the company has a lot of turnaround potential. However, a turnaround is going to take a while, and as such, it may take time for investors to be rewarded for their patience.

Initial projections showed Le Pen’s far-right party in front of President Emmanuel Macron’s centrist alliance and the left-wing New Popular Front — but with potentially less of the vote than it needs to secure an absolute majority after a second round of polling July 7.

Investors have been concerned that a strong showing for Le Pen’s National Rally would increase the odds of expansive fiscal policy, bringing the nation’s bloated fiscal accounts sharply into focus and further muddying the outlook for the common currency.

“The fear was already priced in the markets so there was no real case for a drop this morning,” said Stephane Ekolo, equity strategist at TFS Derivatives. “What I’m afraid for France after the election is a Liz Truss moment and a burst in stress for the French debt.”

The focus now turns to whether her party can garner enough support July 7 to get an absolute majority in the National Assembly, which would allow it to pass legislation more easily. President Emmanuel Macron and her other opponents are already strategizing to keep the far-right party out of power, with any signs of progress likely to bolster the case for a relief rally.

“We now have a week of horse-trading ahead of us,” said Joachim Klement, head of strategy, accounting and sustainability at Liberum Capital, who expects the euro to strengthen through the week as alliances are formed to reduce the gains of Le Pen’s party.

What Bloomberg strategists say...

If the leftist alliance is “is aimed at blocking Le Pen’s grouping from getting a majority in the crucial second round, it has wide-ranging implications for the France-German spread and indeed the euro. If the upshot is that we will get a more centrist government, it would be positive for the currency and herald a narrower spread.”

The National Rally was projected to get as much as 34% of the vote, according to analysis from five polling companies late Sunday. Bloomberg’s final poll of polls on Friday put them at 36.2%.

The left-wing New Popular Front coalition was set to get about 29% and Macron’s centrist alliance between 21% and 22%, projections on Sunday showed.

“Both camps’ fiscal policies are disruptive for the French economy and the prospects for the French debt,” said Vincent Juvyns, global market strategist at JPMorgan Asset Management, referring to the National Rally party and the New Popular Front coalition. “For me it’s still wait-and-see.”

If alliances forming to block Le Pen from absolute power start to look credible, French markets would likely recover, according to Kathleen Brooks, research director at XTB.

“A hung parliament could make it hard to get anything done in France in the current parliament, which is exactly what the markets would like,” she said.

Still, strategists warn there is likely volatility ahead, as the electoral calculus gets complicated in the runoff when parties can strategically withhold candidates in certain constituencies to give a boost to a centrist hopeful.

Volatility Is Only Certainty for Traders Parsing French Results

Macron’s decision to call a snap vote in early June had sent markets into a tailspin.

His party — which supports large spending cuts to get France’s budget deficit under control — suffered a crushing defeat in European parliamentary elections. National Rally, meanwhile, has touted some costly budget measures including lowering the sales tax on energy and fuel.

Over the past two weeks, the extra yield investors demand to hold 10-year French bonds over safer German debt rocketed to more than 80 basis points, levels last seen during the euro area’s sovereign debt crisis. The euro fell to its lowest since early May.

Fiscal Pressures

While the 10-year yield spread may find some relief as trading starts on Monday, it’s hard to see a “material and sustainable snapback,” said Peter Goves, head of developed market debt sovereign research at MFS Investment Management.

“Uncertainties are high, French fundamentals haven’t changed and the final outcome is still unknown and unknowable with the large number of three-way contests complicating matters,” he said.

At a projected 5.3% of output this year, France’s budget deficit already far exceeds the 3% of economic output allowed under European Union rules. The International Monetary Fund predicts without further measures, debt would rise to 112% of economic output in 2024, and increase by about 1.5 percentage points a year over the medium-term.

Yahoo Finance,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/free-streaming-channels-have-become-sleeping-giants-as-netflix-max-others-hike-prices-154745358.html,2024-06-30,15:47:45 UTC,"Free streaming channels have become 'sleeping giants' as Netflix, Max, others hike prices","As streaming services get more expensive, consumers are increasingly turning to free content to fill out their entertainment diets.

Free ad-supported streaming platforms like the Roku Channel (ROKU), Fox affiliate Tubi (FOX), and Paramount's (PARA) Pluto TV, among others, have seen viewership steadily rise over the past few years, a surprising development given the lack of original content and heavy ad load on these channels, known as FAST channels.

FAST — which stands for free ad-supported streaming television — provides both linear and on-demand content in a single viewing experience that relies on advertising for monetization.

The rise of FAST comes as nearly every major streaming service has raised prices in recent months, including Paramount, Netflix (NFLX), Max (WBD), and Amazon (AMZN).

""It is different to be 100% free,"" Tubi CEO Anjali Sud said on the Ringer podcast ""The Town With Matthew Belloni"" in April.

""We're not asking you to subscribe to an ad tier or a subscription tier. We're not trying to upsell you. The fragmentation and friction is reduced.""

In other words, what appeals to users is the accessibility. Julie Clark, executive at marketing insights company TransUnion, described the model as a ""sleeping giant"" in the ever-evolving media landscape.

""FAST is easy, it's accessible,"" she told Yahoo Finance. ""You can get the basics that you need, like the news and the weather, but there's also older programming available and they're starting to have better distribution agreements there as well.""

To put it simply, FAST is the closest thing you can get to cable without actually paying for it. Not to mention that certain FAST providers, like the Roku Channel and Samsung's TV Plus, are also distributed across their respective smart TV devices, further broadening their presence for users.

""There's this catalog of content that is available within the FAST environment that you can binge all day,"" Clark said. ""And with recent price sensitivities, I think we're going to continue to see this grow.""

Content on FAST channels can encompass everything from made-for-TV movies and old shows from traditional studios to low-budget unscripted series, short-form videos, documentaries, and sports.

You still won't catch the new season of ""Bridgerton"" or the latest episode of ""The Bear."" But for cost-conscious consumers, that might not matter.

Tubi, which Fox acquired for $440 million in 2020, led year-over-year growth for the network following a nearly 5% monthly viewing increase in May, according to Nielsen. It secured a platform-best 1.8% of total TV usage for the month as a record 1 million viewers tuned in.

Story continues

Even more impressive? Its average audience for May came in ahead of traditional streamers Disney+, Peacock, Paramount+, and Max, Nielsen confirmed.

""A lot of people confuse Tubi as being sort of this passive FAST channel that is just on rotation in the background of a person's household. It's not,"" Fox CFO Steven Tomsic said at a MoffettNathanson conference last month. ""90% of Tubi consumption is [video on-demand] where it's a real lean-forward experience. People have deliberately chosen the title and watch through it.""

Tubi has experimented with original content, but its bread and butter revolves around its library. Tubi boasts more than 240,000 movies and TV series on its platform, the bulk of which is licensed. Its audience is 63% made up of ""cord cutters"" or ""cord nevers,"" while 40% are not subscribed to other traditional streamers.

Meanwhile, the Roku Channel, which has also dabbled in some original programming, saw a 1.3% monthly bump in viewing. That led the FAST provider to a platform-best 1.5% share of TV — the only company to climb in the rankings for May, nabbing 10th overall.

Competitors have taken notice. Bloomberg recently reported that Netflix is weighing its own free ad-supported tier in certain markets like Europe and Asia. It won't roll out a free version in the US since its subscriber base in the country is already heavily penetrated, according to the report.

But the FAST business model remains unproven. Tubi, for example, has yet to turn a profit. The long-term outlook also remains murky against the expected reacceleration of M&A within the media industry at large.

""I'm probably a little bit more cautious than others,"" Tim Nollen, analyst at Macquarie, told Yahoo Finance. He noted FAST providers must utilize a different strategic approach than other streamers, given their lack of premium or exclusive content.

""A lack of premium content means they have to be effective at using ad technology to target the users that they do have,"" Nollen said. ""It's a large audience, but it may not be a particularly engaged audience. I think they will be successful at using technology to target those users. But it might be in a somewhat different manner.""

Companies like Paramount, Fox, and Roku do not break out the financials of their respective FAST channels, although they're consistently called out as growth drivers on earnings calls.

Paramount, for instance, credited Pluto TV for its double-digit advertising revenue growth in the first quarter. Roku and Fox did the same.

The rise of ads on streaming

Advertising on connected TV, which refers to devices and platforms connected to the internet, has exploded in recent years. And it's not just FAST channels benefiting from the transition.

Companies like Netflix, Disney, and, most recently, Amazon have entered the ad-supported streaming space in recent years. That means more inventory and also more opportunities to better target and monetize consumers through technology.

""There's a lot of ability for advertisers to test, learn, and use sophisticated targeting that was only available within traditional digital advertising before,"" Clark told Yahoo Finance. ""That is absolutely leading to some of the growth in FAST and other ad-supported services.""

MoffettNathanson predicted total advertising on over-the-top streaming services will grow 33% this year, compared with a 17% increase in 2023, fueled by more consumers choosing ad-based streaming tiers.

""There's a comfort level [in] that value exchange,"" Clark said. ""Even younger consumers are getting used to ads on YouTube, so it's this natural progression.""

Ads are also easier to stomach if you know you're paying less (or nothing at all) to watch them.

""People value choice at the end of the day. And we have always been used to watching ads, whether it be on a cable network or on YouTube,"" said Vikrant Mathur, co-founder of Future Today, a company that specializes in ad-supported connected TV solutions.

""But now we have a choice. And if I can save money, I may be more willing to make that compromise.""

Yahoo Finance,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/sizzling-summer-3-top-dividend-125300260.html,2024-06-30,12:53:00 UTC,Sizzling Summer: 3 Top Dividend Stocks to Buy to Cash in on Red-Hot Power Demand,"A heat wave has gripped much of the country this summer. That has people cranking up their ACs to cool down, which is boosting power demand. The rise in power consumption and prices will likely raise the average power bill by about 3% this year compared to last summer.

The current heat isn't the only factor driving up power demand. The increasing electrification of the transportation sector, growth in power-hungry data centers (especially for AI), and other catalysts have the country on track to see a surge in power demand through the end of the decade.

Instead of sweating the heat wave (and rising future power prices), you can cash in on red-hot demand for power. Dominion Energy (NYSE: D), NextEra Energy (NYSE: NEE), and Duke Energy (NYSE: DUK) stand out to a few Fool.com contributors as great ways to potentially generate lots of dividend income from growing power demand.

Dominion Energy is a high-yield work-in-progress

Reuben Gregg Brewer (Dominion Energy): To get the bad news out up front, Dominion Energy's dividend won't be growing for a few years. That's because the company has just completed a corporate overhaul that includes selling natural gas utility assets so that it can focus on its electric utility business. Also in this mix is the goal of shoring up the company's balance sheet and reducing its payout ratio to be more in line with peers.

Thus, no dividend growth for now. But you will be paid very well to wait for Dominion's dividend to start growing again via the stock's attractive 5.4% dividend yield. That's well above the utility average of around 3%. However, the real attraction here is the markets Dominion serves in the Southeastern United States, which includes one of the world's fastest-growing data center markets.

To put some numbers on this, Dominion added 94 data centers to the grid over the past five years and expects to add another 15 in 2024. And there will be more to come in the future. Data centers use a tremendous amount of electricity and support the long-term demand growth that will help Dominion get its capital spending plans and rate requests approved by regulators.

Longer term, Dominion is projecting earnings growth of between 5% and 7%. And once the company has solidified its finances, dividend growth will likely resume and track earnings growth. So, you get a high yield today and a growing dividend tomorrow.

Cashing in on the summer's Sun

Matt DiLallo (NextEra Energy): NextEra Energy has multiple ways to cash in on rising power demand. The company operates the country's largest electric utility (Florida Power & Light, or FPL), which provides electricity to about 5.9 million customers in Florida. It also owns one of the world's biggest clean energy businesses (NextEra Energy Resources), which supplies electricity to other utilities and large corporate buyers.

Story continues

FPL benefits from higher electricity demand when customers crank up the AC on hot summer days. It also benefits from its ability to harness the Sun's power to produce electricity. Last quarter alone, it added more than 1.6 gigawatts (GW) of new, cost-effective solar energy. FPL now owns and operates 6.4 GW of solar, the largest utility-scale solar portfolio in the country. The utility's low-cost solar operations are one reason its customers don't sweat heatwaves (their bills are 37% below the national average).

NextEra's energy resources segment is well-positioned to meet the country's growing demand for power. While it primarily sells electricity under long-term, fixed-rate power purchase agreements, rising prices will enable it to lock in higher rates as legacy contracts expire. Growing power demand also enables NextEra to build more renewable energy capacity.

The company expects strong, rising power demand to drive 6% to 8% adjusted earnings-per-share growth through 2027. That should give it the fuel to increase its dividend, which it has done every year for three decades. It currently expects to grow its payout by around 10% annually through at least 2026. That's a robust growth rate for a payout that already yields an above-average 2.8% (more than double the S&P 500's 1.3 % yield).

Duke Energy has the power to potentially generate strong returns

Neha Chamaria (Duke Energy): Duke Energy is among the largest electric utilities in the U.S., with a customer base of nearly 8.2 million across six states. Importantly, some of these are among the fastest-growing states in the U.S., including Florida, North Carolina, and South Carolina. Florida and South Carolina were, in fact, the two fastest-growing states in the U.S. in 2023, clocking 1.6% and 1.7% growth, respectively, according to the U.S. Census Bureau.

Duke Energy projects 1.5% to 2% annual growth across all its jurisdictions between 2023 and 2028, driven by economic growth led by high-potential industries like artificial intelligence, chip manufacturing, data centers, electric vehicles, automakers, and pharmaceuticals. Florida and the Carolinas were also among the leading states in terms of migration last year, which partly explains why Duke Energy added 195,000 new customers in 2023, also its largest ever.

Duke Energy's profile alone, therefore, positions it well to benefit from a potential surge in power demand. The company isn't resting on its laurels, though -- it plans to invest a whopping $73 billion to expand and modernize its infrastructure through 2028 to grow its rate base steadily. The utility expects its investments to boost adjusted earnings per share by 5% to 7% through 2028, which should also support dividend growth.

The stock yields 4% today, and the utility believes it should be able to maintain its yield in the coming years. Overall, that makes Duke Energy a compelling stock to buy if you want to cash in on rising power demand.

Those low expense ratios wouldn't mean much, though, if Vanguard's funds didn't perform well. The good news is that many of them do. Vanguard's top exchange-traded fund (ETF) is up 24% this year. But there's another ETF up twice as much.

Beating Vanguard's best

Vanguard offers 86 ETFs. One has outperformed all others in 2024: The Vanguard S&P 500 Growth Index Fund ETF (NYSEMKT: VOOG). This ETF has jumped 24% this year following an impressive 28% gain in 2023.

Most investors would probably be happy with these returns. However, those who want even bigger gains might want to check out the VanEck Semiconductor ETF (NASDAQ: SMH). This ETF has soared a whopping 48% year to date.

The VanEck Semiconductor ETF is managed by global investment manager VanEck. This ETF attempts to track the performance of the MVIS U.S. Listed Semiconductor 25 Index. As its name reflects, this index includes companies involved in semiconductor production and equipment that trade on U.S. stock exchanges.

This year's big returns aren't a fluke for the VanEck Semiconductor ETF. It has delivered an average annual return of 38.6% over the last five years. Since the fund's inception in December 2011, its average annual return is 26.5%. By comparison, the Vanguard S&P Growth Index Fund ETF is up 16.6% over the last five years and 15.7% since its inception in September 2010.

Why the VanEck Semiconductor ETF is soaring

You can probably make a good guess as to why the VanEck Semiconductor ETF is performing so well this year. Chip stocks are sizzling hot thanks primarily to surging demand for servers for training and deploying artificial intelligence (AI) systems.

This VanEck ETF owns only 26 stocks. The top five holdings make up over 50% of its total portfolio. When these stocks move higher, so does the ETF's price. And they've moved a lot higher so far in 2024.

The fund's largest holding is Nvidia, which comprises 20.4% of its total assets. Nvidia's share price has exploded 150% higher this year. Customers can't get enough of the company's graphics processing units (GPUs), which are the gold standard in supporting AI models.

Another 12.9% of the VanEck Semiconductor ETF is invested in Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing. The company makes chips designed by leading customers including Nvidia. Its stock is up 65% year to date.

Story continues

Roughly 7.7% of the fund's portfolio is in Broadcom. The company recently announced a 10-for-1 stock split. Its shares have jumped more than 40% in 2024.

The VanEck ETF's fourth- and fifth-largest positions are Advanced Micro Devices and ASML Holding with 4.97% and 4.8%, respectively, of the fund's net assets. Advanced Micro Devices is one of Nvidia's top rivals. Its stock is up only around 8% this year. Meanwhile, shares of semiconductor fabrication equipment maker ASML have risen over 35%.

Should you buy this high-flying ETF?

Risk-averse investors should probably stay away from the VanEck Semiconductor ETF. When it falls, it falls hard. For example, in the second quarter of 2022, the ETF plunged 24%. The fund also trades at a premium with a price-to-earnings ratio of over 39 for the stocks in its portfolio.

However, aggressive investors who want to own a basket of semiconductor stocks should consider buying the ETF. AI should continue to provide a strong tailwind for these stocks. The VanEck ETF's annual expense ratio is 0.35%, higher than Vanguard's top ETF this year but still not too expensive. Also, Morningstar gives the VanEck Semiconductor ETF a five-star rating (the highest possible).

As far as I know, Buffett has never recommended VanEck as he has Vanguard. He doesn't own any VanEck ETFs. But with the pluses of the VanEck Semiconductor ETF, maybe he should.

Yahoo Finance,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/another-artificial-intelligence-ai-stock-123000849.html,2024-06-30,12:30:00 UTC,Another Artificial Intelligence (AI) Stock Split Is Coming. Could Broadcom Be the Next Nvidia?,"If you believe its hype, artificial intelligence (AI) is one of the most profound advances in technology ever. This may be hyperbole -- time will tell -- but it's clear already that the technology has commercial power. Its impact in the market has been enormous, with its champion, Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA), joining Apple and Microsoft as among the biggest companies in the world.

Nvidia's rise led to the company splitting its stock 10-for-1, opening the door to more investors who were priced out. Now another company working in AI is splitting its stock, too. Broadcom (NASDAQ: AVGO), which designs, manufactures, and sells hardware and network infrastructure that allows AI programs to run, will split its stock later this summer.

So let's consider: Could Broadcom deliver the sort of returns Nvidia has?

Revenue growth has been impressive, but it's inflated by a major acquisition

Broadcom is in growth mode, having raised Q1 revenue by 34% from the year before Q2 revenue by 43% from Q2 2023.

AVGO Revenue (Quarterly) Chart

Notice the massive recent increase? That late-2023 inflection point is important. This growth isn't really organic -- much of it is coming from an acquisition. The company bought VMware, a highly successful cloud software company, in November 2023 for $69 billion, adding its revenue to Broadcom's.

Excluding this additional income from VMware, the company grew Q2 revenue by 12% on a year-over-year basis, not quite as eye-watering as the headline-catching 43%.

Looking at future earnings, the company looks reasonably valued

Still, 12% organic growth is nothing to shake a stick at and reflects Broadcom's growing AI-focused business. Communication within the AI server farms that power platforms like ChatGPT is a crucial aspect and is where Broadcom shines. Its PCIe and Ethernet technology is some of the best on the market. This made its products popular.

Hock Tan, Broadcom president and CEO, stated in the company's latest earnings release that ""revenue from our AI products was a record $3.1 billion during the quarter."" The combo of a growing AI business and a solid acquisition means that the company expects to continue delivering record revenues. It raised its guidance for this year to $51 billion in revenue, up 42% from 2023.

So what does this mean for how fairly valued the company is? If we look at its forward P/E, the company looks pretty solid at about 34. That's in line with much of big tech and is significantly lower than Nvidia's 48.

Broadcom is a solid company, but it'll have trouble rivaling Nvidia

Broadcom's growth prospects, while promising, just aren't comparable to Nvidia's, in my opinion. Nvidia is growing revenue at a pace that far outstrips Broadcom and doing it organically, not relying on costly acquisitions. Consensus estimates have Nvidia delivering more than twice the revenue growth of Broadcom by the end of this fiscal year and again next year.

Story continues

And this disparity will be even greater in looking at net income. Look at the difference over the last year.

AVGO Net Income (TTM) Chart

It's not just the acquisition affecting this. Nvidia expects to operate with roughly 20% better margins this year than Broadcom.

Aside from the numbers, Nvidia demonstrated immense vision as a pioneer in AI. While difficult to quantify, I think visionary leadership is an factor that can't be underestimated. As the industry matures and competition heats up, Nvidia's leadership may help it maintain its top position.

At the end of the day, however, Broadcom is still a good investment with a solid track record and optimistic prospects. Is it the next Nvidia? I don't think so, but it doesn't need to be.

Yahoo Finance,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/halfway-2024-2-underperforming-magnificent-083000320.html,2024-06-30,08:30:00 UTC,"Halfway Into 2024: 2 Underperforming ""Magnificent Seven"" Stocks to Buy Before They Take Off","The ""Magnificent Seven"" represent some of the strongest businesses around. However, a few members of this elite group have failed to live up to expectations in the first half of 2024.

Since the beginning of the year, the widely followed S&P 500 index has climbed 14.8% through June 26, but weak iPhone sales have weighed on Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL) shares, which are up 11.6%. Tesla (NASDAQ: TSLA) has been the worst performer, with a recent dip in sales from its electric cars sending the stock down 21%.

Sometimes, betting on strong companies when they are experiencing temporary weakness can pay off over the long run. Indeed, both companies have promising growth opportunities unfolding in artificial intelligence (AI), which could have a huge impact on shareholder returns over the next decade.

Here's why these stocks are ready to take off.

1. Apple

Weak iPhone sales have weighed on Apple stock year to date, but since the company's last earnings report in early May, the stock is outperforming the S&P 500, with the shares up 21%. The stock got a significant bounce following the company's Worldwide Developers Conference in June, where Apple unveiled highly anticipated artificial intelligence (AI)-powered features coming to iOS 18 later this year.

Apple Intelligence will be the biggest update to Apple's operating system in years. The AI features in this update will allow users to summarize long texts, create images, and receive personalized search assistance from Siri, just to name a few highlights.

Of course, Apple has a profitable business angle here. While iOS 18 will be free to download like previous updates, the AI features will require devices with more recent processors, such as the A17 Pro chip found on the iPhone. iOS 18 will be a huge incentive for users with older devices to upgrade, and that could lead to record iPhone revenue during the holiday quarter.

Beyond iOS 18, iPhone 16 is also expected to come in a new larger size of 6.9 inches for the Pro Max version, which could be enough to drive strong demand on its own. It's all setting up for a stretch of improving revenue growth over the next year.

Wall Street analysts are increasingly bullish. The current consensus is that Apple's sales will grow just 3% in fiscal 2025, but Evercore ISI recently raised its growth forecast from 4% to 7% and even sees a scenario where Apple could report double-digit top-line growth next year.

More analysts may raise their growth estimates as the launch of iOS 18 draws closer, which could send the stock even higher in the second half of 2024.

Story continues

Of course, the push into AI software could also benefit Apple's higher-margin services business (e.g., app sales) and drive above-average earnings growth. For these reasons, Apple is likely heading into a stretch of accelerating growth that could launch the stock higher over the next few years.

2. Tesla

Tesla shares have been slashed in half from their all-time high. A few reasons are to blame, including weak car demand amid rising interest rates and the uncertainty around the recent shareholder vote to reinstate CEO Elon Musk's 2018 performance award.

With shareholders recently voting to reinstate Musk's $56 billion pay package, it removes a major cloud over the stock since some investors were concerned that Musk might eventually leave Tesla if the vote didn't pass. However, the stock has moved higher since the vote as investors turn their attention back to Tesla's growth opportunities.

Tesla plans to unveil Cybercab in August, which opens up a massive market for the company. Analysts expect most of Tesla's revenue to come from the robotaxi market over the long term, which is significant, given that the company's $626 billion market cap is mostly based on its revenue from electric cars that generate more than 80% of the company's revenue right now. However, RBC Capital sees 52% of Tesla's valuation will ultimately be driven by robotaxis, 27% by full-self-driving car software, 15% by Megapack batteries, and only 6% by electric cars.

Musk compared Tesla's robotaxi business strategy to those of services like Airbnb and Uber. Tesla will operate some of the robotaxi fleet itself, while a certain number of customers can choose to contribute their own cars to the service. Tesla aims to one day have tens of millions of cars in its fleet worldwide. It would lead to a new high-margin revenue stream in service fees flowing back to Tesla.

The robotaxi opportunity reflects Tesla's growing capabilities in AI. It has about 35,000 Nvidia H100 graphics processing units (GPUs) currently used for AI training, but it plans to have more than twice that number by the end of 2024. These are not cheap, with each H100 selling for thousands of dollars. Tesla's capital expenditures have quadrupled over the last four years to $9 billion and will continue to grow.

If Tesla is successful in expanding its robotaxi service over the next decade, it could have a huge impact on the company's profitability and, therefore, lead to a higher valuation for Tesla stock. Given the company's history of proving critics wrong, it's worth keeping some shares of this Magnificent Seven stock among your stock holdings for a rainy day.

Yahoo Finance,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/rivian-soars-volkswagen-investment-too-133000251.html,2024-06-30,13:30:00 UTC,Rivian Soars After Volkswagen Investment. Is It Too Late to Buy the Stock?,"Share prices of Rivian (NASDAQ: RIVN) surged higher after the maker of electric vehicles (EV) received a sizeable investment from German automaker Volkswagen (OTC: VWAGY). Despite the recent price gains, the stock is still down nearly 43% in 2024.

Let's look at the importance of this investment, how it could help Rivian, and if it is too late to buy the stock.

Volkswagen investment

Volkswagen announced it will invest up to $5 billion in Rivian over three years as well as form a 50/50 joint venture (JV) between the companies. Volkswagen will initially invest $1 billion in the company in the form of a convertible note, which will convert to Rivian shares once it receives regulatory approvals, but not before Dec. 1, 2024.

If the JV is approved, the German automaker would look to invest another $4 billion into Rivian or the JV by 2026, including another $1 billion this year upon the implementation of the JV. The purpose of the JV will be to develop next-generation electrical/electronic (E/E) architecture for EVs.

For the JV, Rivian will contribute its expertise in the field of electronic architecture for software-defined vehicles and the associated IP via a fully paid-up license. The formation of the JV will also allow Volkswagen to use Rivian's current electronic architecture in its own vehicles, which includes its new zonal hardware design.

For Volkswagen, the deal brings with it immediate access to much-needed technology to develop its next generation of EVs. Rivian is one of the few non-Chinese automakers outside of Tesla so far to develop zonal architecture.

For Rivian, meanwhile, this is a huge cash infusion that will allow the company to continue to scale its business. Along with the current $7.9 billion in cash on its balance sheet, this should give Rivian ample room to ramp up production of its lower-priced R2 SUV models at its Illinois plant, as well as build out its planned $5 billion manufacturing campus in Georgia, which it temporarily paused construction on earlier this year.

Volkswagen will also lend some of its manufacturing expertise, which can help Rivian continue to cut manufacturing costs. Rivian has done a great job creating popular luxury electric SUVs, but it has not been able to sell them for a profit, losing money on each vehicle it sells. At its investor day following the Volkswagen announcement, the company spent much of its time discussing reducing the costs of its vehicles so it could obtain a positive gross margin.

The company reiterated its forecast to be near a positive gross margin in the fourth quarter, and it set a long-term target of a 25% gross margin. It is also looking for a 10% free cash flow margin and a high-teens adjusted profit margin over the long term.

Is it too late to buy the stock?

The Volkswagen investment, if the JV is approved, should give Rivian the cash it needs to scale its business and make it viable. Negative gross margins and cash flow have been its biggest issues, but the company has made aggressive steps to reduce the cost of its vehicles and improve its manufacturing process.

The development of its zonal architecture, meanwhile, has not only greatly improved the cost structure of its vehicles, but has also proven to be a highly valuable technology that Volkswagen was willing to pay a lot of money to get access to for use in its vehicles.

The deal now gives Rivian two very large powerful investors and partners in Volkswagen and Amazon, for whom it has a deal in place to make Amazon's electric van fleet.

Rivian remains a high-risk/high-reward stock given its early-stage nature and still negative gross margin. However, the deal with Volkswagen helped remove a lot of the liquidity risk associated with the company. As such, the stock looks more attractive from a risk-reward basis after its recent run-up than before the deal.

Yahoo Finance,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/stock-market-crash-2024-3-080600868.html,2024-06-30,08:06:00 UTC,Stock Market Crash 2024? 3 Predictive Metrics That Suggest a Sizable Downturn in Stocks Is Forthcoming,"Over the long run, Wall Street has proven to be a bona fide wealth creator. Although other asset classes, such as bonds and housing, have made investors richer, nothing else comes remotely close to the average annual return that stocks have delivered for more than a century.

Right now, Wall Street is enjoying yet another rip-roaring bull market. Since the green flag waved at the start of 2023, the ageless Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJINDICES: ^DJI), benchmark S&P 500 (SNPINDEX: ^GSPC), and growth-fueled Nasdaq Composite (NASDAQINDEX: ^IXIC) have respectively increased by 18%, 43%, and 71%, as of the closing bell on June 27, 2024.

But if there's one given on Wall Street, it's that stocks don't move up in a straight line. While artificial intelligence (AI) and stock-split euphoria are fueling the current bull market, three predictive indicators with historically strong correlations to downside on Wall Street appear to foreshadow a potential stock market crash in 2024.

A historic decline in U.S. M2 money supply

To be clear, no metric can, with guaranteed accuracy, forecast a short-term directional move for the major stock indexes. However, select indicators have historically had a knack for predicting downside in the Dow Jones, S&P 500, and Nasdaq Composite. U.S. M2 money supply is one such metric.

M2 money supply comprises everything you'd find in M1 -- cash and coins in circulation, as well as demand deposits in a checking account -- and adds in money market accounts, savings accounts, and certificates of deposit (CDs) below $100,000. Think of M1 as money that can be spent on the spot and M2 as money that can still be spent somewhat easily but requires more work to get to.

For nine decades, M2 money supply has been expanding with virtually no interruption. In other words, more capital has been needed in circulation to support a growing economy.

WARNING: the Money Supply is officially contracting. 📉



This has only happened 4 previous times in last 150 years.



Each time a Depression with double-digit unemployment rates followed. 😬 pic.twitter.com/j3FE532oac -- Nick Gerli (@nickgerli1) March 8, 2023

But since peaking in April 2022, M2 has meaningfully fallen off. Although it's up 0.69% on a year-over-year basis, U.S. M2 money supply has declined by 3.49% on an aggregate basis since its all-time high. As you can see in the post on X from Reventure Consulting CEO Nick Gerli, this marks only the fifth time since 1870 (when back-tested) that M2 has moved lower by at least 2% on a year-over-year basis (1878, 1893, 1921, 1931-1933, and 2023).

Story continues

The four previous instances where M2 fell by at least 2% correlated with periods of double-digit unemployment and economic depressions. While two of these instances occurred prior to the creation of the Federal Reserve, and the likelihood of a depression is very low today, the takeaway is that less capital in circulation leads to fewer discretionary purchases by consumers. In short, it's a recipe for a recession -- and the stock market historically performs poorly once a recession has been declared.

The longest yield-curve inversion of the modern era

The second predictive tool that appears to portend trouble for Wall Street is the Treasury yield curve. Compared to the M2 money supply, this is a much more popular metric.

Normally, the Treasury yield curve slopes up and to the right. This is to say that longer-dated Treasury bonds (those maturing in 10 or 30 years) sport higher yields than Treasury bills set to mature in a year or less. The longer your money is tied up in an interest-bearing asset, the higher the yield should be.

10-2 Year Treasury Yield Spread Chart

Since July 5, 2022, the spread (difference in yield) between the 10-year bond and the two-year Treasury bill has been underwater. In other words, Treasury securities maturing in two years have had a higher yield than the 10-year Treasury bond. This is what's known as a yield-curve inversion, and it's the longest one of the modern era.

Here's the interesting thing about yield-curve inversions: They've preceded every single U.S. recession since the end of World War II. Approximately two-thirds of the S&P 500's peak-to-trough drawdowns have occurred during U.S. recessions.

However, and this is a big ""however,"" not every yield-curve inversion has been followed by a recession. Think of a yield-curve inversion as a necessary ingredient that signals the U.S. economy is facing headwinds.

Stocks are exceptionally pricey

The third predictive metric that suggests a potential stock market crash may be forthcoming is the valuation-based Shiller price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio, also commonly referred to as the cyclically adjusted price-to-earnings (CAPE) ratio.

Whereas the traditional P/E ratio focuses on trailing-12-month earnings, the S&P 500's Shiller P/E is based on average inflation-adjusted earnings over the prior 10 years. Examining 10 years' worth of earnings history smooths out the ""hiccups"" (e.g., the effects of COVID-19) that might otherwise skew investors' perceptions of value.

S&P 500 Shiller CAPE Ratio Chart

As of the closing bell on June 27, the S&P 500's Shiller P/E stood at 35.70. For some context, this is more than double its 17.13 average when back-tested over the last 153 years.

What's of interest with the Shiller P/E is examining how Wall Street's major stock indexes have responded when it's surpassed 30 during a bull market. Since 1871, this has occurred six times: 1) August 1929-September 1929, 2) June 1997-August 2001, 3) September 2017-November 2018, 4) December 2019-February 2020, 5) August 2020-May 2022, and 6) November 2023-current.

The five prior instances of the Shiller P/E ratio topping 30 eventually resulted in the Dow Jones Industrial Average, S&P 500, and/or Nasdaq Composite shedding between 20% and 89% of their value.

As you can see by the dates of these six instances, there's no rhyme or reason for how long stocks can remain pricey. What is clear is that extended valuations aren't sustained over the long run. When the S&P 500's Shiller P/E ratio tops 30 for any length of time, it's historically been a cautionary tale that a bear market and/or potential crash awaits.

Time and perspective change everything

To reiterate, the three predictive metrics above suggest the ingredients exist for a potential stock market crash in 2024. What they don't do is guarantee anything. It's impossible to concretely forecast what stocks will do a week, a month, or even a year from now.

But when investors take a step back and widen their perspectives, it becomes a lot easier to forecast where stocks are collectively headed.

Take the economic cycle as a good example. No matter how much workers might loathe the idea of slowdowns and recessions, the fact remains that they're perfectly normal. No amount of well-wishing can stop recessions from occurring.

However, this boom-bust cycle for the economy isn't linear. Since World War II ended in September 1945, nine of 12 U.S. recessions were resolved in less than a year, and none of the remaining three surpassed 18 months. By comparison, most periods of economic growth stuck around for multiple years, with two expansions lasting longer than 10 years. Being an optimist and betting on the U.S. economy to expand has, without question, been a smart move.

This same dynamic plays out on Wall Street.

It's official. A new bull market is confirmed.



The S&P 500 is now up 20% from its 10/12/22 closing low. The prior bear market saw the index fall 25.4% over 282 days.

In June 2023, Bespoke Investment Group made the post you see above on X. It highlights the calendar length of every bear and bull market in the S&P 500 dating back to the start of the Great Depression in September 1929. What you'll note is that the average length of bull markets (1,011 calendar days) for the S&P 500 is roughly 3.5 times longer than the typical S&P 500 bear market (286 calendar days).

To add, almost half of the S&P 500 bull markets (13 of 27) stuck around longer than the lengthiest bear market over a 94-year stretch.

An extensive data set from the investment advisors at Crestmont Research adds to the value of time and perspective. Crestmont's analysts calculated the rolling 20-year total returns of the S&P 500, including dividends, when back-tested to 1900. This research yielded 105 rolling 20-year periods (1919-2023).

What this data set showed was that all 105 rolling 20-year periods would have produced a positive annualized total return. In plain English, if you had hypothetically purchased an S&P 500 tracking index at any point since 1900 and held that position for 20 years, you'd have made money, without fail, every single time.

No matter how scary the data or short-term predictions may appear, time and perspective haven't let investors down.

Yahoo Finance,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/best-stocks-invest-50-000-121900503.html,2024-06-30,12:19:00 UTC,"The Best Stocks to Invest $50,000 in 2024","Stocks have been on the rise this year, with the S&P 500 up 15% year to date. The index is on track to outperform last year's growth, as the S&P 500 rose 13% over the same period (January to June) in 2023.

Wall Street has grown particularly bullish about tech stocks thanks to advances in fields like artificial intelligence (AI). The same was true this time last year. However, the key difference is there have now been several quarters of tangible results that prove AI is truly boosting earnings for several companies and is a worthy venture.

However, tech is a lot more than AI. The industry covers countless sectors that will likely keep it expanding for decades. As a result, it could be a good idea to make a considerable investment in companies with exposure to AI and other areas of tech. Innovative organizations that lead critical parts of the industry could deliver major gains over the long term as the tech market expands.

So, are you looking to invest $50,000 in the stock market? Here are two of the best stocks that money can buy in 2024 (and are even worth buying with a smaller investment).

1. Nvidia

Nvidia's (NASDAQ: NVDA) business has exploded over the last year as it has become a leader in AI. Its chips have become the gold standard in the industry, coveted by developers worldwide. As a result, the company's stock is up 196% year over year, driven primarily by excitement over AI. However, as a leading chipmaker, Nvidia has positions in multiple markets outside of AI that could further boost its business for years.

Before the recent boom in AI, Nvidia was best known for its prominent role in gaming. The company was one of the first to sell graphics processing units (GPUs) for the consumer market, which gamers use to custom-build high-powered gaming PCs. Nvidia's success in the industry gave it the financial resources to branch out to other tech sectors like data centers, game consoles, consumer products, self-driving cars, and AI.

Increased interest in AI kicked off at the start of last year. However, Nvidia was a promising growth stock long before that, with its share price rising 338% in the five years leading up to 2023. AI has only strengthened Nvidia's outlook and worth as a long-term investment.

In the first quarter of 2025 (ending April 2024), Nvidia's revenue climbed 262% year over year, fueled mainly by a 427% increase in its data center segment (representing a rise in AI GPU sales). However, the company also saw encouraging growth in gaming and automotive, where revenue rose 18% and 11%.

Story continues

The automotive segment includes income from chips supplied to companies leading the way in self-driving technology. The market is still in its infancy but could be a major growth catalyst as chip demand rises alongside the expanding industry.

In addition to massive growth potential across tech, Nvidia's price/earnings-to-growth ratio (PEG) is less than 1, indicating its stock remains a value play despite recent growth. At its current position, an investment of $25,000 would secure roughly 201 shares in Nvidia -- significantly more than a few months ago, thanks to a recent stock split.

At this price, the company is screaming buy this year for long-term-minded investors.

2. Amazon

Like Nvidia, Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN) has significantly expanded its reach in tech. Since its founding in 1994, Amazon has ventured into and eventually dominated multiple industries, including e-commerce, video streaming, and cloud computing.

It's as if the company can do no wrong, with solid leadership and vast financial resources that allow it to expand and overcome unexpected hurdles. As a result, its stock is a compelling option as it continues to see gains in retail and develops its roles in AI and digital ads.

In the first quarter of 2024, Amazon's revenue popped 13% year over year. The company profited from massive gains in operating income, more than tripling since last year to $15 billion thanks to growth in its retail segments and highly profitable cloud platform, Amazon Web Services (AWS).

Moreover, the quarter signaled a budding business for the company, with revenue from advertising services jumping 24% after the introduction of ads on its Prime Video streaming service. Amazon has a competitive edge in the industry with a leading market share in streaming. This could allow it to dominate the developing streaming advertising market in the coming years, further diversifying Amazon's business.

A $25,000 investment would buy roughly 130 shares in Amazon at its current price. The company's stock has climbed more than 100% over the last five years but could outperform that figure as it continues to expand in AI and other areas of tech. Like Nvidia, Amazon's PEG is also less than 1, making its stock just too good to pass up in 2024.

Yahoo Finance,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/billionaires-selling-nvidia-buying-undervalued-082500110.html,2024-06-30,08:25:00 UTC,Billionaires Are Selling Nvidia and Buying These Undervalued ETFs Instead,"Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA) has seen the value of its shares skyrocket over the past two years as the biggest chip supplier in the race for artificial intelligence (AI) supremacy.

Several hedge fund managers spotted the potential for Nvidia in AI early and made considerable bets on the semiconductor stock. Stan Druckenmiller accumulated a sizable position in the stock in late 2022 and early 2023 as OpenAI's ChatGPT took the world by storm. At one point, Nvidia stock accounted for 16% of his portfolio. David Tepper, owner of the NFL's Carolina Panthers, likewise built a huge position in the stock in the first half of 2023.

But billionaires, as a group, have started selling off their Nvidia shares. That's in large part due to the incredible run the stock has been on. It's up over 160% this year already, and it was briefly the most valuable company in the world.

Here are some of the billionaires selling their positions in Nvidia:

Stan Druckenmiller (Duquesne Family Office) sold 441,551 shares and all 4,895 call options, reducing his total exposure to the stock by about 84%.

Philippe Laffont (Coatue Management) sold 2.9 million shares, cutting his position by 68%.

David Tepper (Appaloosa) sold 348,000 shares, trimming his position by 44%.

Israel Englander (Millennium Management) sold 720,004 shares and 6,910 calls, cutting his bullish position by about one-third. He also trimmed Millennium's put options, but by less than 20%, leaning more bearish.

Billionaires are smart to take some of their money off the table and reinvest into other assets as a way to diversify their portfolios and potentially find the next big winners. The ones listed above put a lot of the money from selling Nvidia into some undervalued exchange-traded funds (ETFs) that both diversify away from Nvidia and provide a lot of potential upside.

Betting big on small stocks

Both Druckenmiller and Englander added exposure to the iShares Russell 2000 ETF (NYSEMKT: IWM). It tracks the Russell 2000 index, which is the most commonly used index for small-cap stocks.

Druckenmiller bought 31,579 call options on the ETF, which had a total value of $664 million as of the end of the first quarter. That makes the ETF his largest position, representing 15% of his portfolio. Englander, meanwhile, pared back on puts while adding a substantial number of calls and shares of the ETF itself.

There's good reason to be more bullish on small caps these days. While large-cap stocks like those found in the S&P 500 have fully recovered from the 2022 bear market, small-cap stocks like those in the Russell 2000 or S&P 600 aren't back to all-time highs. The current high interest rates are much more challenging for small caps, which often rely on revolving debt to fund their growth instead of long-term bonds or existing cash flows.

Story continues

As such, the valuation of small-cap stocks remains depressed relative to the large-cap market. The gap between the forward price-to-earnings ratio of the S&P 500 and the S&P 600 is the largest it's been since 2001. That could make it a stellar opportunity to invest in small-cap stocks right now. Druckenmiller is going big, and Englander is also coming around to the idea.

Finding value in China

Tepper and Laffont are looking to the world's second-largest economy for investment opportunities. Both added shares of the iShares China Large-Cap ETF (NYSEMKT: FXI). It tracks the performance of the FTSE China 50 Index, which follows 50 of the largest and most liquid Chinese companies trading on the Hong Kong Stock Exchange.

Tepper bought 6.4 million shares of the ETF, which had a value of $153.4 million as of the end of the first quarter, representing about 2.3% of his portfolio. Laffont added 2.1 million shares, worth about $50 million, or 0.2% of Coatue's portfolio.

Tepper is extremely bullish on China, adding many large-cap tech names from the country last quarter, including Alibaba Group, Baidu, PDD Holdings, and JD.com. Most can be found in the iShares ETF.

China was slow to reopen as COVID-19 pressures eased, and it now faces a property crisis, slow economic growth, and deflation as consumers slow their spending. It also faces political tensions. Stock prices declined for a third consecutive year in 2023. While prices have recovered somewhat in 2024, the China Large-Cap ETF is still down nearly 50% from the all-time high reached in early 2021.

But the tide might be turning for China. Pandemic-related restrictions have eased up, and the government is enacting stimulus measures to support the property sector and get Chinese consumers spending again. The efforts began in earnest in February, and the impact on the stock market is evident. Tepper and Laffont's new favorite ETF is up 22% since the start of February.

Considering how far Chinese stocks have fallen, there's still a long way for them to come back. Valuations remain attractive, but there's still a lot of uncertainty about how strongly China can rebound. With the attractive prices for some of the leading names in their industries, however, it could be worth taking a closer look at the Chinese stock ETF.

The S&P 500 (^GSPC) enters Q3 up 14.5% so far this year, while the Nasdaq Composite (^IXIC) rallied more than 18%. The Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI) gained a more modest 3.8% in the first six months of the year.

With stocks sitting near record highs and recent inflation trends proving more positive, all eyes have turned to the labor market for signs of weakness as the Fed maintains its restrictive interest rate stance.

The June Jobs report will provide a robust look at the labor market on Friday, while updates on private payrolls and job openings will also be in focus throughout the week. Updates on activity in the manufacturing and services sectors will also be scattered throughout the schedule.

Constellation Brands (STZ) is expected to be the focus of the lone notable corporate earnings report during an otherwise quiet week before big banks officially kick off second quarter earnings season the following week.

Markets in the US will close early on July 3 (1 p.m. ET) and will remain closed on July 4 for Independence Day.

A look at the labor market

The June Jobs report is due for release on Friday morning and is expected to show further cooling in the job market.

The report is expected to show that 188,000 nonfarm payroll jobs were added to the US economy last month, with unemployment holding steady at 4%, according to data from Bloomberg. In May, the US economy added 272,000 jobs while the unemployment rate ticked up slightly to 4%.

Bank of America US economist Michael Gapen reasoned a report along these lines would continue to show a labor market that is ""cooling but not cool.""

On Friday, the latest reading of the Fed's preferred inflation gauge showed inflation eased in May as prices increased at their slowest pace since March 2021.

The print was viewed as a step in the right direction for the Federal Reserve's fight against inflation.

Positive trends in inflation, combined with signs of slowing in economic activity, have economists arguing the Fed should be leaning toward cutting interest rates sooner rather than later.

""Emerging signs of softness in the labor market show [Fed] officials also need to be attentive to risks to the full employment side of their mandate,"" Oxford Economics deputy chief US economist Michael Pearce wrote in a note to clients.

Halftime report

Just like 2023, most of 2024's stock market rally has been driven by a few large tech stocks.

Story continues

Midway through the year, more than two thirds of the S&P 500's gains for the year have come from Nvidia (NVDA), Apple (AAPL), Alphabet (GOOG, GOOGL), Microsoft (MSFT), Amazon (AMZN), Meta (META), and Broadcom (AVGO). Nvidia alone has driven nearly one-third of these gains.

Despite some short-lived rallies throughout the year, just two sectors have outperformed the S&P 500 this year: Communications Services and Information Technology. Both are up more than 18% compared to the S&P 500's roughly 15% gain.

This has kept the debate going over whether the second half of the year will bring a broadening of the stock market rally, a hot-button issue on Wall Street.

Morgan Stanley's chief investment officer Mike Wilson recently argued in a research note that given weakening economic data and high interest rates, a true broadening in which sectors unrelated to tech pick up the slack is unlikely to happen.

""Narrow breadth can persist but it's not necessarily a headwind to forward returns in and of itself,"" Wilson said. ""We believe broadening is likely to be limited to high quality/large cap pockets for now.""

More megacap exceptionalism

Most strategists have reasoned that megacap tech companies have led the rally for good reason, given their earnings continue to outperform the market. That's expected to be the case during second quarter earnings as well.

Nvidia, Apple, Alphabet, Microsoft, Amazon, and Meta are expected to grow earnings by a combined 31.7% in the second quarter, per UBS Investment Bank US equity strategist Jonathan Golub.

The S&P 500 itself is expected to grow earnings by a more modest 7.8%.

This means that the lion's share of earnings growth is once again expected to come from Big Tech. And a similar trend has been seen in earnings revisions for the second quarter.

Since March 31, Golub's work shows earnings estimates for the S&P 500 have fallen just 0.1%, far less than the typical 3.3% drop seen on average. This is due in large part to a 3.9% revision upward for the aforementioned six biggest tech companies.

Entering the second half of the year, the debate over whether these Big Tech companies' consistent earnings beats will fall off will remain at center stage.

Yahoo Finance,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/senator-questioning-plug-powers-government-160700242.html,2024-06-30,16:07:00 UTC,"With a Senator Questioning Plug Power's Government Loan, Is This an Opportunity to Buy the Stock?","Shares of Plug Power (NASDAQ: PLUG) surged in May after the company announced that it had received a conditional commitment for a $1.66 billion loan from the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE). However, the stock is now well below where it was before the announcement, and one U.S. senator has called the loan into question.

The stock, meanwhile, is now down over 70% in the past year.

Let's look at the proposed DOE loan, why it is being called into question, why it is so important for Plug Power, and whether the slide in the stock is a buying opportunity.

Fixing a flawed business model

Plug Power has long been grappling with a flawed business model, which it has set out to fix. The company initially found a niche selling fuel cells used in forklifts and other material-handling equipment to companies with high-volume, three-shift warehouses like Amazon and Walmart.

But the flaw in its business model was that it would sell the hydrogen fuel needed to run its fuel cells at a loss. This could be seen in the company's most recent results, where negative gross margin led to a $159 million gross loss.

Just to emphasize how bad this is, the loss was measured before any corporate costs. The company loses a lot of money on the hydrogen fuel it sells, although in the first quarter, it also lost money on the equipment it sold.

Obviously, acquiring or making something for $3 and then selling it for $1 is not a durable business model, but that is pretty close to what Plug Power did last quarter with hydrogen fuel. Over the years, the company has mostly obtained hydrogen from third parties and sold it to its customers at a huge loss.

This is why it has embarked on building a network of its own hydrogen plants that can produce fuel that it can sell to its customers for a profit.

This is where the DOE loan comes in. In May, the company was given the chance to secure the loan -- if certain conditions to be negotiated by the company and the government are met -- to help it build out its hydrogen plant network. If it is approved, the loan would help fund up to six green hydrogen production facilities.

Plug Power already has two plants up and running, and another is expected to be complete by the end of the year, and that would meet about 65% of where it sees demand headed.

The loan would help create a large plant in Texas scheduled for next year that would meet its customer needs and allow it to expand beyond that.

However, in June, Sen. John Barrasso, a Republican from Wyoming who is the ranking member of the Senate Committee on Energy and Natural Resources, asked the DOE's inspector general to investigate ""any potential impropriety"" by the the DOE’s Loan Programs Office and the loan program's director, Jigar Shah, due to possible conflicts of interest. The senator also questioned Plug Power's viability given its $1.4 billion in losses last year.

Story continues

While Plug Power could pursue financing elsewhere if the loan ultimately does not get approved, the terms and interest rates would undoubtedly be much less favorable. And given the company's financial position and negative operating cash flow, there is no guarantee it would be able to find an institution to lend it the money.

Image source: Getty Images.

Is the sell-off a buying opportunity?

Plug Power shares shot up as much as 70%, to $4.90, in the day after the DOE loan offer was announced. Today it is trading more than 15% below where it was before the announcement.

If the loan is approved, there should be some immediate upside potential given the past reaction and where the stock now trades. However, that could be short-lived.

Plug Power, meanwhile, has said it is looking to get to gross margin breakeven in its fuel business in the fourth quarter, which would not be dependent on the loan. That is a potential catalyst, but a break-even gross margin is still not a complete solution because it will not make the company profitable or start generating cash.

At this point, I would view Plug Power more like a lottery ticket. If it gets the loan, builds out its plants, and turns positive in gross margin and free cash flow, there could be tremendous upside in the stock. But just like most lottery tickets, there is also the chance it becomes worthless.

In a note on Sunday, he pointed out that the top 10 companies in the S&P 500 account for 35% of the index's market value but only 23% of its earnings.

""This divergence has never been bigger, suggesting that the market is record bullish on future earnings for the top 10 companies in the index,"" Sløk wrote. ""In other words, the problem for the S&P 500 today is not only the high concentration but also the record-high bullishness on future earnings from a small group of companies.""

Because the S&P 500 is weighted by market cap, soaring share prices of Big Tech companies rushing into the AI boom has meant that recent gains are concentrated into just a handful of stocks, obscuring the relative mediocrity for rest of the index.

Before Nvidia began its selloff earlier this month, the AI chip leader accounted for more than a third of the S&P 500’s rally this year.

“Such a high concentration implies that if Nvidia continues to rise, then things are fine,” Sløk warned on June 12. “But if it starts to decline, then the S&P 500 will be hit hard.”

As market leadership becomes more concentrated, so are investors' portfolios, especially as putting money in funds that track indexes becomes increasingly popular.

Bank of America analysts said in a recent note that the average large-cap fund has 33% of its portfolio in its top five holdings, up from just 26% in December 2022.

Similarly, the share of funds the have more than 40% of their portfolio in their top five holdings has jumped to 25% from less 5% in December 2022.

Meanwhile, Wall Street analysts have been bullish on the S&P 500 and are scrambling to raise their year-end targets. Even one of the biggest bears has surrendered and is now one of the most bullish analysts.

And Fundstrat Global Advisors cofounder Tom Lee recently said the S&P 500 could hit 15,000 by the end of the decade. He isn’t the only Wall Street bull making bold predictions.

Ed Yardeni has been pounding the table about another “Roaring Twenties” super-cycle and has said the S&P 500 would jump to 6,000 by next year. By the end of the decade, he said the stock index could reach 8,000.

Yahoo Finance,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/google-buys-stake-taiwan-solar-021038909.html,2024-07-01,02:10:38 UTC,Google buys stake in Taiwan solar power firm owned by BlackRock,"By Simon Jessop and Susanna Twidale

LONDON (Reuters) - Google said it has taken a stake in Taiwan's New Green Power and could buy up to 300 megawatts of renewable energy from the BlackRock fund-owned firm to help cut its carbon emissions and those of suppliers.

Companies are being pushed to cut greenhouse gas emissions linked to their operations and value chains by investors and Big Tech firms have been among the most ambitious in their targets.

Google aims to constantly run on carbon-free energy wherever it operates. Yet sector growth in demand for data-processing capacity to power artificial intelligence has seen emissions jump.

Taiwan, a major site for Google's cloud technology with a data centre and company offices, still relied on fossil fuels to generate nearly 85% of its power, Amanda Peterson Corio, Google's Global Head of Data Center Energy told Reuters.

""The goal of this investment is really to support the build out of a large-scale solar pipeline in Taiwan,"" Corio added.

Regions such as Asia Pacific can be harder to decarbonise due to less developed infrastructure and restrictions limiting the ability of corporate users to buy green power.

New Green Power, owned by a fund managed by BlackRock's Climate Infrastructure business, was one of the leading solar developers and operators in Taiwan, BlackRock's Global Head of Climate Infrastructure David Giordano told Reuters.

Google and BlackRock both declined to specify the size of the equity stake being taken in NGP, but Corio said the investment was expected to drive the equity and debt financing for the build-out of its 1 gigawatt (GW) pipeline.

Taiwan is targeting 20 GW of solar capacity by 2025 and up to 80 GW by 2050, BlackRock said.

Corio said that as well as using some of the solar power it buys to drive its own operations, Google would also be able to offer some to its suppliers and manufacturers in the region.

Sharing with suppliers would help Google lower its so-called Scope 3 emissions, those tied to its value chain, she added.

Yahoo Finance,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/dividend-stock-down-37-ready-134500489.html,2024-06-30,13:45:00 UTC,This Dividend Stock Is Down 37%: Is It Ready to Skyrocket?,"While many investors want the stocks that they own to soar in price over time, there are some market participants who appreciate the passive income that their holdings throw off on a consistent basis. Starbucks (NASDAQ: SBUX) might catch the attention of these folks.

The world's leading coffee enterprise has paid a steadily rising dividend since 2010. The current yield sits at a healthy 2.9%. The only issue is that this stock is down 37% from its peak price, which was hit in July 2021.

Might Starbucks shares be ready to skyrocket again?

Hitting a rough patch

The company's stock performance in recent years might cause you to scratch your head. That's because fiscal 2023 revenue of $36 billion was 24% higher than the coffee chain generated in 2021, with operating income up 21% over that two-year stretch. Unsurprisingly, the business took a hit during the pandemic's height, but it has since been on a solid recovery path.

However, shares have been on a downswing in the past 14 months, and they immediately dipped 16% following the second-quarter 2024 (ended March 31) financial update. It's not hard to figure out why.

During the 13-week period, same-store sales declined 3% in the U.S., which is the company's most important market. This was driven by a troubling 7% drop in transaction counts. In the huge China market, it's a worse situation as same-store sales tanked 11%. CEO Laxman Narasimhan called this a ""challenging operating environment"" as consumers become more selective with their spending.

Scaring investors even more was the fact that management lowered guidance for fiscal 2024. It now expects revenue to increase by low single digits, down from a prior range of 7% to 10%.

Favorable qualities

It's not encouraging for shareholders to see Starbucks in this state. But for long-term investors, it's important to stay focused on the company's favorable qualities, of which there are many.

For starters, Starbucks has a wide economic moat, stemming from its brand strength, that protects its competitive position. There is something about Starbucks that has differentiated it and allowed it to resonate with consumers. It's hard to quantify a brand's status. But I think the fact that the company has typically been able to grow same-store sales through higher prices and foot traffic over long stretches of time demonstrates it has something special.

Plus, it helps that Starbucks' average gross margin over the past 10 years, for example, is a superb 28.2%. This might go overlooked, but Starbucks is a consistently profitable and financially sound enterprise. Ongoing positive earnings and free cash flow are precisely what help the business fund its dividend payouts.

Story continues

And the expansion isn't finished. As of March 31, there were nearly 39,000 Starbucks locations scattered across the globe. That's a ridiculously large figure. However, management believes there is still a sizable growth runway going forward. By 2030, the goal is to have a whopping 55,000 locations open, at which point sales and earnings will be much higher than they are today.

Low market expectations

Investors have clearly soured on Starbucks. The shares have taken a hit because there's uncertainty as to when things will start to improve.

But this pessimism creates a buying opportunity for those who can look out over the next three to five years. Starbucks trades at a price-to-sales ratio of under 2.5 right now. Shares have basically never been cheaper in the past decade.

To be clear, I'm not entirely sure that the stock will skyrocket. However, based on the company's positive attributes, I'm optimistic about this investment working out well for buyers.

Can the Growth Continue in the Second Half of 2024?,"Super Micro Computer (NASDAQ: SMCI) has become one of the more dramatic and surprising companies in the stock market over the past year. The company existed for decades in obscurity, and its stock gained little traction for years after its 2007 initial public offering (IPO).

However, a key partnership with Nvidia has changed the game for Supermicro (as the company is commonly called). Consequently, its stock is up 190% in the first half of this year. With its massive gains, investors are right to ask whether that momentum can continue through the second half of 2024.

The state of Supermicro

Supermicro is a technology hardware company known for producing energy-saving, environmentally friendly tech products for the cloud, metaverse, and other applications. Its servers have gained the most attention, particularly those equipped with Nvidia's artificial intelligence (AI) chips. Thanks to this partnership, its profits and stock price have grown exponentially.

As recently as four years ago, its stock traded for about $24 per share. This year, its recent growth has been so dramatic that analysts predict nearly $24 per share for Supermicro's net income! Not surprisingly, such improvements have led to a 3,400% gain in the tech stock's price since 2020.

SMCI Chart

A Market.us study seems to confirm this trend. It predicts that the AI server industry will expand at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 30% through 2033, transforming what was a $31 billion industry last year into one worth $430 billion by 2033.

Can the growth continue?

Even the most dedicated Supermicro bulls should not expect another 3,400% gain over the next four-and-a-half years. While an additional 190% gain in six months is far from guaranteed, that move is not out of the question when one looks at the financials. In the nine months of fiscal 2024 (ended March 31), its net sales of $9.6 billion rose 95% from year-ago levels. Its cost of sales grew at a slightly faster 102%.

Consequently, its net income of $855 million grew 92% over the same period. Also, with consensus estimates pointing to a 102% increase in net income for the fiscal year, its earnings are rising fast enough for the stock to maintain a rapid growth pace.

Additionally, despite surging profits and massive stock price growth, its price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio is 47 and its forward P/E ratio is 36. This is less than some of the faster-growing tech stalwarts such as Nvidia and Amazon, indicating it could sustain the multiple expansions needed to take the stock price much higher, possibly enough to maintain the current growth pace for another six months.

Story continues

Supermicro in the second half of 2024

Given its business and financial conditions, a 190% gain for the second half of this year is a plausible scenario. Admittedly, the market makes no guarantees, and ultimately, investors should not expect a 190% move higher by the end of 2024.

However, demand for the company's servers is likely to continue rising, possibly enough to sustain near triple-digit revenue and profit growth for the foreseeable future.

At its current valuation, a 190% increase in the stock price would give it an expensive, but not record-breaking P/E ratio. Hence, even if it falls short of that ambitious goal, Supermicro could still deliver significant returns for the rest of the year.

Most Read from Bloomberg

The original cryptocurrency is down about 13% since March, a sharp contrast from the 67% and 57% surges seen, respectively, in the previous two quarters. Bitcoin, which reached a record $73,798 on March 14, is closing the quarter at around $61,000.

The downturn has raised the question of whether cracks in momentum trades such as Bitcoin point to a tougher outlook for risk appetite as the prospect of higher-for-longer interest rates hangs over financial markets.

“A lot of people in the market have questions that are mostly anchored on concerns from a macro perspective,” Austin Reid, global head of revenue and business at FalconX. “So I think there’s just some short-term uncertainty being reflected within the crypto market, as we’re seeing in some other asset classes too.”

One of the best measures of the waning interest may be the slowing of demand for the US ETFs allowed to hold Bitcoin, which were approved by the Securities and Exchange Commission in January.

Investors poured about $2.6 billion into Bitcoin funds in the second quarter, compared with around $13 billion in the first three months of the year, according to data compiled by CoinShares.

“There was a lot of euphoria around the release of the ETFs, and then there was a natural price correction after the rally,” said Matthew O’Neill, co-director of research at Financial Technology Partners.

The ETFs received a flood of interest from professional investors who wanted Bitcoin exposure but were were only looking to buy into the cryptocurrency through institutional means, O’Neill said.

For investors who haven’t bought into the ETFs yet, he said they may be waiting to hop in during the next upward Bitcoin price move.

Yahoo Finance,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/3-ai-stocks-second-half-114000529.html,2024-06-30,11:40:00 UTC,3 AI Stocks for the Second Half of 2024,"The tech bull market sparked by innovations in generative AI in 2023 continued in the first half of 2024. Even when focusing on tech broadly rather than the industry's strongest performers, the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite Index yielded a total return of nearly 19%.

Knowing that, investors may wonder which stocks could lead the way in the second half of the year. While the market offers no guarantees, the last two quarters of the year could be the time when some stocks begin to rise in earnest. In this article, three Motley Fool contributors deliver insights on stocks they believe investors should watch for the remainder of the year.

Alphabet is positioned to leverage its search-market dominance into AI riches

Jake Lerch (Alphabet): My choice is Alphabet (NASDAQ: GOOGL) (NASDAQ: GOOG), the parent company of Google. What I really like about Alphabet is that the company combines two of the most critical features of any outstanding stock: potential, best represented by its artificial intelligence (AI) tools, and results, as seen in its consistent financial performance.

Let's examine its potential first. Regarding AI, the sky is the limit for Alphabet. The company's latest AI-powered personal assistant, Google Assistant, offers many features to help people accomplish more. Through voice commands alone, users can:

Set timers, create lists, and save locations and passwords.

Call, text, and read emails aloud.

Gather local information, such as weather, traffic, and directions.

Answer general questions, such as ""how many grams in an ounce"" or ""what is 18% of $57.""

Find and play music, movies, or podcasts.

Moreover, Alphabet can capitalize on its massive user base. As the most-visited website in the world, Google processes over 8.5 billion searches per day -- about one for every person on the planet. As such, Alphabet has a significant opportunity to make Google Assistant the preferred AI assistant. This could lead to substantial benefits for Alphabet in the future as it explores ways to monetize Google Assistant through a subscription model where users pay a monthly fee for premium features or an advertising model where companies pay to have their products or services recommended by the assistant.

In the meantime, Alphabet can rely on its already established businesses, such as Google Cloud, YouTube, and Android, to keep ""bringing home the bacon."" These businesses show consistent growth and profitability, adding to Alphabet's overall stability and investment potential.

To sum up, Alphabet could be the AI stock to watch in the back half of 2024 -- and beyond. Investors seeking a stock with an unbeatable combination of potential and results would be wise to consider it.

Meta stock isn't done riding the AI wave

Justin Pope (Meta Platforms): Social media giant Meta Platforms (NASDAQ: META) has been on a rocket-like trajectory. Shares have risen 45% since January and are up an astonishing 326% since January 2023 when artificial intelligence began picking up steam. In just 18 months, Meta stock created the magnitude of wealth the broader market generally takes decades to achieve. I understand if people feel skeptical that Meta has more in the tank.

Yet, the fundamentals indicate that Meta could ride its current momentum through the latter half of this year. That's driven primarily by strong operating performance and a stock valuation that's still borderline cheap. Meta's core business is advertising to its billions of social media users. Meta impressively still gains users even though so many people already use its apps. Meta's family of apps, which include Facebook, Instagram, and WhatsApp, grew to 3.24 billion daily active users in the first quarter, a 7% year-over-year jump.

Digital advertising continues to take market share away from older media formats like television and print, so Meta is also enjoying tailwinds there. Meta's ad volume was up 20% year over year in Q1. Lastly, Meta has started using AI to help companies advertise more efficiently, which helped increase Meta's price per ad by 6% in Q1. In other words, Meta benefits from multiple variables boosting its primary business.

Investors will need to see how Meta continues to perform in future quarters. Analysts are very optimistic; 2024 earnings-per-share estimates of $20.16 would represent 35.5% growth over 2023. Meanwhile, analysts believe Meta will grow earnings by an average of over 19% annually for the next three to five years. Given that healthy growth outlook, Meta stock remains arguably cheap at a forward price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio of 25.

Meta is a world-class business that experienced severe adversity in 2022. The comeback has created eye-popping returns. While Meta's meteoric rise means there's probably far less upside than before, investors shouldn't jump ship too soon. There is still plenty of wind in its sails.

In the AI chip space, a rising tide could lift AMD

Will Healy (Advanced Micro Devices): Given Nvidia's dominance in the AI chip space, potential competitors are easy to dismiss at first glance.

However, according to Allied Market Research, the AI chip industry is expected to grow at a 38% compound annual growth rate (CAGR) through 2032. With Nvidia apparently struggling to meet current demand, it leaves an opening for competitors such as Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ: AMD).

Even though Nvidia leads in the innovation battle, AMD has a history of catching up to and sometimes surpassing its competitors. Moreover, while a Nvidia AI chip costs around $30,000 to $40,000, AMD's $10,000 to $15,000 semiconductors will likely appeal to customers who are anxious to snap up any AI chips they can find.

More recently, investors largely overlooked AMD as its revenue of $5.5 billion in Q1 2024 grew by only 2% yearly. However, data-center revenue of $2.3 billion rose 80% over the same period. Moreover, it made up 42% of the company's overall revenue, a level comparable to Nvidia's percentage of data-center revenue at the end of fiscal 2022 (ended Jan. 30, 2022) of 39%.

Fast forward to fiscal 2025 Q1 (ended April 28), and 87% of Nvidia's revenue came from its data center segment. With AMD's aforementioned 80% data-center growth, Nvidia's recent history shows how AMD could follow in its footsteps as AI chips become its dominant source of revenue.

Also, thanks mostly to AI chips, Nvidia's revenue grew 262% yearly in that quarter. Although AMD may or may not match that number over time, Nvidia's recent history describes what could happen to AMD's revenue growth as its AI chip sales accelerate.

Additionally, AMD holds a significant valuation advantage if looking beyond its misleading P/E ratio of 232. The company currently trades at a price-to-book value ratio of around 4.5. In comparison, Nvidia sells at 63 times its book value. This differential makes AMD stock a relative bargain, giving the stock room to run as the sale of AI chips becomes a more critical revenue stream.

Yahoo Finance,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/spousal-social-security-benefits-3-095000736.html,2024-06-30,09:50:00 UTC,Spousal Social Security Benefits: 3 Things All Retired Couples Should Know,"Married couples share nearly everything -- food, homes, vacations, and more. In some cases, they can even share Social Security retirement benefits.

The Social Security program has included spousal benefits since its beginning in the 1930s. Here are three things all retired couples should know about spousal Social Security benefits.

Image source: Getty Images.

1. Eligibility requirements for spousal benefits

Can you receive Social Security retirement benefits based on your spouse's work record? Only if you meet specific eligibility requirements.

First, you usually must be married to your spouse for at least one year before you can receive Social Security spousal benefits. This doesn't apply, however, if you are the parent of your spouse's child. Ex-spouses may also be eligible for spousal benefits if they were married for at least 10 years.

Second, you'll need to be at least 62 years old to claim spousal benefits with a couple of exceptions. If you provide care for a child age 16 or younger, the age requirement is waived. That's also the case if you provide care for a child age 17 or older with a disability who is entitled to receive Social Security dependent benefits based on your spouse's record.

Third, your spousal benefit can't be higher than the amount you'd receive based on your own earnings history. If it isn't, the Social Security Administration (SSA) will pay you based on your own work record rather than your spouse's.

2. Potential spousal benefit amount

The maximum spousal benefit is 50% of the higher-earning spouse's primary insurance amount (PIA). The PIA is the amount of the higher-earning spouse's benefit at their full retirement age. For anyone born in 1960 or later, the full retirement age is 67.

Spouses won't receive this maximum benefit, though, if they begin collecting benefits before their own full retirement age. The Social Security early retirement penalty will be imposed with benefits reduced by five-ninths of 1% for each month up to 36 months before reaching full retirement age and five-twelfths of 1% for each month before then. However, if a spouse is providing care for a qualifying child, the spousal benefit won't be reduced.

Note that the spousal benefit isn't based on when the higher-earning spouse begins collecting retirement benefits. If this spouse retires early or holds off until age 70, it won't change the amount of the spousal benefit. However, it would impact the survivor's benefit if he or she dies.

3. Deemed filing

The Bipartisan Budget Act of 2015 made an important change often referred to as the ""deemed filing"" rule that affects Social Security spousal benefits. Deemed filing means when individuals file for spousal benefits, they also must file simultaneously for their own retirement benefits. In the past, people could file for spousal benefits before reaching their full retirement age but hold off on filing for their own retirement benefits until they reached full retirement age.

Story continues

However, the deemed filing rule doesn't apply if you receive spousal benefits because you're providing care for your retired spouse's qualifying child. It also doesn't apply to survivor benefits. If your spouse dies, you can begin receiving Social Security survivor benefits without filing for your retirement benefit.

The $ 22,924 Social Security bonus most retirees completely overlook

If you're like most Americans, you're a few years (or more) behind on your retirement savings. But a handful of little-known ""Social Security secrets"" could help ensure a boost in your retirement income. For example: one easy trick could pay you as much as $22,924 more... each year!

Yahoo Finance,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/1-top-artificial-intelligence-ai-073000658.html,2024-06-30,07:30:00 UTC,"1 Top Artificial Intelligence (AI) Stock to Buy Before It Soars 70%, According to Loop Capital","The artificial intelligence (AI) revolution is in full swing, and according to one Wall Street analyst, things don't appear to be slowing down any time soon for one extremely well-positioned company.

While most investors are gravitating toward chip leader Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA) at the moment, AI is and will continue to mint other market winners as well. In fact, one S&P 500 AI company has outperformed even Nvidia this year. And despite this stock's impressive 2024 run, one Wall Street analyst predicts another 70% surge.

Super Micro Computer has beaten Nvidia and is ready for a liquid cooling breakout

This year, server-maker Super Micro Computer (NASDAQ: SMCI) has already surged 212%, handily outperforming Nvidia's impressive 149% year-to-date gain.

Supermicro has undoubtedly benefited handily from a close partnership with Nvidia as a preferred server partner. However, the company has also been gaining market share thanks to its in-house engineering prowess.

Supermicro's strategy of building servers out of ""building block"" pieces allows for fast, large-scale customization while also saving customers money. With the building block architecture, parts of a server are easily swapped and upgraded rather than having to replace the whole unit.

Moreover, the building block architecture and close relationship with Silicon Valley tech companies generally allow Supermicro to custom-build servers faster than rivals. With so many companies falling over themselves to build advanced AI infrastructure as quickly as possible, it's no wonder customers are flocking to Supermicro's solutions.

SMCI Chart

In addition, Supermicro's longtime ethos of resource-saving, energy-efficient design has come to the fore in the age of AI. AI chips require a tremendous amount of energy and must dissipate lots of heat. To help further lower energy costs, Supermicro is now rolling out its own direct liquid cooling (DLC) technology.

DLC technology has been around for decades. However, because it's an added cost and can take a long time to deploy in a data center, it has garnered only around 1% of the data center market.

However, AI servers are becoming extremely energy-intensive and will soon require DLC as opposed to air-cooled racks. DLC data centers limit the need for extensive air conditioning systems, saving both energy and space within the data center and thereby allowing even denser server clusters.

From its mere 1% market share, CEO Charles Liang expects a wave of DLC deployments to make up 15% of Supermicro racks this year and 30% next year. According to Liang, Supermicro can deliver DLC solutions within weeks today, and DLC deployment can help reduce data center power usage by up to 40%.

Story continues

So, despite the company's 200% revenue growth last quarter, DLC's benefits to customers should help keep up the company's hypergrowth and margins for the foreseeable future.

Is Super Micro Computer going to $1,500 per share? Image source: Getty Images.

Loop Capital thinks Supermicro is going to $1,500

Over the past few years, Supermicro has routinely trounced even the most bullish analyst expectations. But with this year's admission to the S&P 500 Index, many more Wall Street analysts have begun covering the stock.

One of the most bullish is the technology-centered research shop Loop Capital. In April, Loop analyst Ananda Baruah raised his price target on Super Micro Computer from $600 to $1,500 per share.

Explaining the increase, Baruah correctly noted that Supermicro has developed a reputation as ""an increasing leader in the need for both complexity and scale"" for AI deployments. Furthermore, Baruah sees Supermicro's speed and agility as a key factor, elaborating, ""While it's not truly possible to know the magnitude of these wins or timeframe of deployments, there has been a general industry dynamic of standing up deployments faster as opposed to slower.""

To obtain his valuation, Baruah sees Supermicro earning between $50 and $60 in fiscal 2026, ending in June of 2026, on revenue of between $30 billion and $40 billion. That compares with estimates for nearly $15 billion in revenue and $24 billion in fiscal 2024, which ends today, June 30.

With that type of growth and earnings power, Baruah thinks Supermicro can retain a 25 to 30 price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio, even in 2026. So, 30 times $50 or 25 times $60 gets one to his $1,500 target.

Supermicro could be more advantaged than Nvidia

While Nvidia is the king of AI chips today, the company is also due to receive an onslaught of competition from other processor companies and cloud giants' custom ASICs (application-specific integrated circuits). However, Supermicro's servers can house any kind of AI chip.

Thus, Supermicro should see continued growth and share gains no matter which AI chip wins the day or even if the wins are spread out among several chipmakers. That makes the stock a solid buy today, even after its impressive year-to-date gains.

Yahoo Finance,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/boeing-buy-spirit-aero-4-041118022.html,2024-07-01,04:11:18 UTC,Boeing to buy Spirit Aero in $4.7 billion deal after months of talks,"(Reuters) -Boeing said on Monday it would buy Spirit AeroSystems in a $4.7 billion all-stock deal following months of talks, as it tries to resolve a sprawling corporate and industrial crisis that has also engulfed the key supplier.

Boeing said the total deal value was about $8.3 billion including debt. Each share of Spirit common stock will be exchanged for between 0.18 and 0.25 Boeing shares, resulting in an equity value of about $37.25 per share, as reported by Reuters on Sunday.

Spirit's shares closed at $32.87 on Friday.

Separately, Airbus, also a Spirit customer, said it would take over core activities at four of the supplier's plants in the United States, Northern Ireland, France and Morocco as well as minor activities in Wichita, Kansas.

The Airbus part of the deal was triggered by Boeing's decision to buy back its former subsidiary, which had branched out into supplying Airbus and others since becoming independent from Boeing almost two decades ago.

Because the Airbus-related activities lose money, industry sources had said the European planemaker was pressing for up to $1 billion in compensation in return for taking over the plants, which make strategic parts for the A350 and A220 jets.

Airbus said it would receive $559 million in compensation from Spirit, depending on the final outlines of the deal, while it would pay Spirit a symbolic $1 for the assets.

Spirit said it also planned to sell businesses and operations in Prestwick, Scotland and in Subang, Malaysia that support Airbus programs. It also plans to sell operations in Belfast, Northern Ireland that do not support Airbus programs.

Boeing said the Spirit deal was expected to close by mid-2025.

Yahoo Finance,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/buy-crowdstrike-stock-now-part-221500378.html,2024-06-30,22:15:00 UTC,Should You Buy CrowdStrike Stock Now That It's Part of the S&P 500?,"The latest rebalancing for the S&P 500 took place in mid-June, and cybersecurity darling CrowdStrike (NASDAQ: CRWD) earned a spot in the esteemed index. While getting added to the S&P 500 is an impressive milestone, it's not reason enough to buy a stock. Nevertheless, CrowdStrike is firing on all cylinders, and I think it's best days are ahead.

Let's dig into the company's progress and explore why now is a lucrative opportunity for long-term investors to own CrowdStrike.

CrowdStrike is in a league of its own

CrowdStrike operates in the cybersecurity industry and specializes in threat detection and endpoint protection through its flagship platform, called Falcon. While the cybersecurity landscape is ripe with competition, CrowdStrike stands out as a winner, thanks to its proven ability to cross-sell.

For the company's first quarter of fiscal 2025 (ended April 30), nearly two-thirds of CrowdStrike's total customers were using five or more products. Moreover, new deals with eight or more products increased 95% year over year. By selling multiple products to its customer base, CrowdStrike can expand its recurring revenue base, all while recognizing strong profit growth.

For the quarter ended April 30, CrowdStrike's annual recurring revenue (ARR) increased 33% year over year to $3.7 billion. Furthermore, the company posted net income of $43 million during the first quarter, compared to just $0.5 million during the same period last year.

The combination of accelerating revenue and profit growth is encouraging, and I think it's just getting started.

The party is just getting started

Back in 2022, CrowdStrike released an investor presentation showcasing a total addressable market (TAM) size of $75 billion at that time. Management further explained that with the company's current product portfolio at that time, the TAM could reach $97 billion by 2025 and $158 billion by 2026 should CrowdStrike execute on its new-product roadmap.

Clearly, a lot has changed over the last couple of years. Not only are cybersecurity protocols more important than ever to combat hackers and protect data and privacy, but developments in artificial intelligence (AI) are making their way to just about every use case in the tech realm.

According to the company's most recent investor presentation, CrowdStrike now believes its TAM is $100 billion. What's more, management sees the addressable market expanding to $225 billion by 2028 as generative AI becomes increasingly featured in cybersecurity tools.

Is CrowdStrike a good stock to buy right now?

CrowdStrike has proven that it can compete in an intense cybersecurity market and do so in a highly profitable way. Moreover, as AI demand continues to surge, the company should be in a position to benefit from secular tailwinds.

Story continues

The one drawback of investing in CrowdStrike is its pricey valuation. Right now, its stock trades at a forward price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio of 96 and a price-to-free-cash-flow (P/FCF) multiple of 93.

Simply put, the stock is expensive -- even for growth investors. With that said, I still think CrowdStrike is a compelling opportunity.

The rate at which the company and its addressable market are growing shouldn't go unnoticed. Cybersecurity in and of itself is a big market, and CrowdStrike has built a formidable position, even though there are many larger, better-capitalized players. Furthermore, now that AI has become increasingly more important for businesses of all sizes, CrowdStrike fits squarely at the intersection of two of the tech sector's hottest end markets.

Considering the company's ARR of $3.7 billion represents only 1.6% of the current estimated market size, CrowdStrike has a long way to go before its business starts to mature or plateau.

I think CrowdStrike's premium valuation is warranted and I am optimistic the company can continue generating strong top-line growth, supplemented by robust cash flow. Long-term investors may want to consider a position in CrowdStrike as a hedge to other AI stocks. It's a leading company among cybersecurity opportunities.

8 hours ago By Kevin Peachey , Cost of living correspondent Share

A drop in domestic gas and electricity prices has now taken effect, but costs are expected to rise again in October. Regulator Ofgem's new price cap for England, Wales and Scotland came into force on Monday, meaning a typical household's energy bill will fall by £122 a year. That brings down the bill for a household using a typical amount of gas and electricity to £1,568 a year, the lowest for two years. But forecasters expect it to rise again in the run-up to winter, more than reversing the latest drop.

Leading consultancy Cornwall Insight predicts that a typical household's annual bill will be back up to £1,723 in October, a £155, or 10%, increase from now. ""Modest falls in summer look set to be wiped out by bigger rises in autumn when people will need to put the heating back on,"" said Adam Scorer, chief executive of charity National Energy Action. ""The cost of energy remains an unaffordable luxury that many of the poorest simply cannot afford."" Although the price cap is changed every three months, it is illustrated by Ofgem in terms of an annual bill for a household using a typical amount of gas and electricity. People in larger properties will tend to pay more overall owing to higher energy usage, and those in smaller properties will pay less.

That is because the cap, set by Ofgem, limits the maximum price that can be charged for each unit of gas and electricity - not the total bill. It affects the gas and electricity bills of 28 million households, but does not impact customers in Northern Ireland, where the sector is regulated differently but where prices are also falling.

Energy bills are considerably lower than the peak after Russia's invasion of Ukraine, when the government stepped in to limit bill rises. That has fed through to falls in the general rate of rising prices, known as inflation. However, a typical household's energy bill remains about £400 higher than three years ago, prompting debate over the issue during the election campaign.

In addition, households have built up a collective debt to suppliers of about £3bn owing, primarily, to the pressure from high prices. Those on prepayment meters, who tend to top up meters during the colder, darker months and are often under more financial pressure, will see a less immediate impact of a drop in prices in the summer. The vast majority of households pay by direct debit, and their payments are smoothed out over the year. They should have been contacted by their supplier about the latest price changes. Experts say it is a good idea to take a meter reading now, to ensure billpayers are charged at the correct rate. Ofgem is reviewing the way the price cap is calculated, including sifting through a host of responses to a consultation on standing charges.

Latest changes in detail

The new prices that took effect for July to the end of September mean: Gas prices are now capped at 5.48p per kilowatt hour (kWh), and electricity at 22.36p per kWh

A typical household uses 2,700 kWh of electricity a year, and 11,500 kWh of gas

Households on pre-payment meters pay slightly less than those on direct debit, with a typical bill of £1,522

Those who pay their bills every three months by cash or cheque pay more, with a typical bill of £1,668

Standing charges - a fixed daily charge covering the costs of connecting to a supply - are unchanged at 60p a day for electricity and 31p a day for gas, although they vary by region

Dave Ricks urged the next government to consider how it could become ""world class"" in attracting investment

The boss of the world's most valuable pharmaceutical company has told the BBC that the UK's planning system puts companies off investing in the country.

Dave Ricks, chief executive of the obesity drug manufacturer Eli Lilly, said he had considered building a factory in the UK in the last decade, but chose another country instead.

He warned current planning processes were an ""impediment"" to building factories at speed, unlike in the US and Ireland.

""Mostly what they do is they pre-reserve land, they promise to cut through the red tape and layers of government,"" Mr Ricks said.

Eli Lilly, along with its Danish rival Novo Nordisk, has developed a considerable lead over the rest of the pharmaceutical industry when it comes to obesity medication.

Its drugs, which include Zepbound and Mounjaro, are in such demand that the company cannot build factories quickly enough.

The country has operations in the US, Ireland and other European Union countries including Italy, France and Germany.

Mr Ricks said countries that ""could present a path"" in which the time taken to set up a pharmaceutical plant was reduced from five years to two was ""very attractive"".

""In the UK - although I love visiting, it's a wonderful county - it’s not the largest market so you have to overcome that with other attractiveness, whether that be workforce, asset delivery or economic incentives,"" he said.

""You have to be candid, say 'are we as competitive as we can be?' And to date it's been a little bit less, but I think it's not unachievable.""","UK planning laws deter investment, says drugs giantDave Ricks urged the next government to consider how it could become ""world class"" in attracting investmentThe boss of the world's most valuable pharmaceutical company has told the BBC that the UK's planning system puts companies off investing in the country.

A lawyer representing families of victims of two fatal Boeing 737 Max crashes says they ""strenuously object to this plea deal""

A lawyer representing victims of two fatal Boeing 737 Max crashes has told the BBC that the US government is preparing to offer the plane maker a ""sweetheart plea deal"".

Paul Cassell, who says he got the information ""directly from the Justice Department"", added that the deal includes a small fine, three years of probation and independent safety audits.

Boeing did not immediately reply to the BBC's request for comment, while the Justice Department (DoJ) declined to provide a statement.

Last month, US prosecutors recommended that the DoJ bring criminal charges against the plane maker.

That was after the DoJ said Boeing had violated a 2021 settlement related to the crashes which killed 346 people.

""The memory of 346 innocents killed by Boeing demands more justice than this,"" said Mr Cassell, adding that the ""families will strenuously object to this plea deal"".

The plane crashes - both involving Boeing's 737 Max aircraft - occurred within six months of each other.

The crash involving Indonesia's Lion Air occurred in October 2018, followed by an Ethiopian Airlines flight in March 2019.

Both crashes were linked to faulty flight control systems.

A letter sent last month by Mr Cassell to the DoJ revealed that the families had been seeking prosecutions of Boeing's top executives at the time of the crashes and a fine of $24.8bn (£19.6bn) for ""the deadliest corporate crime in US history"".

The Justice Department has until 7 July to decide whether to revive a criminal charge of fraud brought against Boeing in 2021.

That charge has lain dormant since the company acknowledged in a settlement that it had misled air-safety regulators about aspects of the 737 Max, and promised to create a new compliance system to detect and prevent further fraud.

Under the deal reached in 2021, Boeing said it would pay a $2.5bn settlement and prosecutors agreed to ask the court to drop a criminal charge after three years if the company abided by certain stipulations set out in the deferred prosecution agreement.

But in May, the DoJ said Boeing was in breach of the deal, stating that it had failed to ""design, implement, and enforce a compliance and ethics program to prevent and detect violations of the US fraud laws throughout its operations"".

Earlier this year Boeing was again put in the spotlight when a door panel fell off a new 737 Max plane during an Alaska Airlines flight.","Boeing to get 'sweetheart deal' -victims' lawyerA lawyer representing families of victims of two fatal Boeing 737 Max crashes says they ""strenuously object to this plea deal""A lawyer representing victims of two fatal Boeing 737 Max crashes has told the BBC that the US government is preparing to offer the plane maker a ""sweetheart plea deal"".

Getty Images Unite workers are set to start striking on 8 July over Tata’s plans to cut 2,800 UK jobs

Tata Steel has offered to meet unions for fresh talks on the condition strike action in south Wales is called off. In a letter to the UK Steel Committee, which represents the Community, Unite and the GMB unions, the company is believed to have offered to discuss future investment in Port Talbot. But the unions would be required to suspend future industrial action. Unite general secretary Sharon Graham told BBC Wales: ""They suspend closure, we suspend action.""

Unite workers are set to start striking on 8 July over Tata’s plans to cut 2,800 UK jobs. The union wants the company to delay the closure of the heavy end of steel production in Port Talbot, which is due to happen by the end of September. Community and GMB have a mandate from their members for strike action but have not confirmed any dates, saying they would wait until after the general election before announcing their next moves. The offer to start fresh talks with the unions follows discussions between Tata and Unite in the days since announcing the proposal to bring forward the closures of both Port Talbot blast furnaces. On Thursday the company said it would close both furnaces this week unless it could ""safely and stably operate"" them during the strike. On Sunday it wrote to all three unions, offering to begin new talks if the strike was called off. The talks are not a renegotiation of the existing plan, but focus on future investment opportunities. Alun Davies, Community’s national officer, said the letter ""simply reaffirms"" the position agreed by the unions and Tata at their last meeting on 22 May, and did not constitute a new agreement in response to Unite's actions. Unite had previously pulled away from multi-union talks, and was the only union to launch industrial action. Mr Davies said it was ""welcome"" Unite were ""reaffirming their commitment to the position they previously agreed"", that unions would agree on a memorandum of understanding before putting it to members to vote on.

BBC Qcells is investing billions in a solar panel factory in Georgia

The former “carpet capital of the world” is getting a multi-billion-dollar makeover. Here in the rural Georgian town of Dalton, once known for its fabric floor coverings, a Korean company called Qcells is spending $2.5bn (£2bn) to expand its solar panel factory, with another in the works. It's a bold initiative that will create 2,500 quality jobs in the next 12 months, in an area where the average household income is roughly 27% below the national average. It is hoped the project will revitalise a corner of the US whose glory days seemed over. And it's due in no small part to someone many of the residents of this Republican district would rather not credit - Joe Biden. The president's landmark 2022 Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) – his signature green legislation - offered hundreds of billions of dollars in tax incentives, credits and loans to stimulate American manufacturing in clean energy.

The most ambitious climate legislation in US history has generated a tsunami of private sector investments, with big implications for the rest of the world. And Georgia - a state President Biden hopes is in play in this year’s presidential election - has been a big beneficiary. But with four months before the president goes head-to-head against Donald Trump, the billions of dollars of new investment in this key battleground state doesn’t appear to have lifted the incumbent’s support. President Biden’s pitch is that solving the climate problem is also good for jobs. Since the law was passed, more than 300,000 clean energy jobs have been created in the US, according to the advocacy group Climate Power. And there's no doubt it’s creating opportunities in places like Dalton. Here you see Bidenomics in action - foreign and government money being used to fight climate change and build an economy from the middle out.

Qcells' Scott Moskowitz points to the massive investments in US renewables

Scott Moskowitz, head of market strategy for Qcells, says that Georgia had been a great home since 2019, but that the IRA had been an “accelerant”. Without it, he muses, the current expansion might not have happened at all. “What our industry has seen, since the IRA has passed, is more investment in the past two years in solar and clean energy manufacturing than the previous 20 years,” he says. And yet that message either isn't getting through or simply isn't resonating with locals – not even local Democrats. Jan Pourquoi, the spokesperson for the local Whitfield County Democratic Party, tells me: “In the business community, there is a resentment against that company [Qcells].” Mr Pourquoi, a Belgian expat should know. He owns one of the small carpet firms in town. We spoke in his office, overlooking the factory floor where they turn flooring remnants into small rugs. “The business community resents the fact that we have a company from South Korea coming in this area with government subsidies, while they themselves get nothing from the government,” says Mr Pourquoi, who identified as a Republican before switching parties following Trump’s election in 2016. He tells me that local voters know little about the IRA law. “Nobody cares about clean energy, not around here. That is the type of stuff that I would call the ‘latte liberals’ care about in the big city.”

Qcells Qcells has been expanding its vast factory in Dalton

Well, at least one person does, and that's Marjorie Taylor Greene, the firebrand Republican congressional representative for the district. She has touted Qcells' expansion, despite voting against the law that helped make it possible. It’s creating some awkward dynamics for Republicans. The IRA is in Donald Trump’s sights. If Republican lawmakers win big in the Congressional elections that are also taking place on 5 November, then portions of President Biden’s signature climate law could be repealed, threatening a clean energy boom happening in their communities across the US. I sat down for coffee with Kasey Carpenter, Dalton’s Republican member in the Georgia House of Representatives. We met at Oakwood Café, the bustling diner he owns along with a string of other local businesses, including a pizza joint and a boutique hotel. Mr Carpenter downplayed the potential impact on Qcells of manufacturing tax credits being rolled back. He doesn’t think it would jeopardise the solar investments in his district. But he adds that if clean energy investments were to become at risk “I’m sure we’ll be speaking with the Trump team”. Our conversation ends with him saying it would be another feather in Dalton’s cap if this carpet town could also lay claim to the title of “solar panel capital of the world”.

But that belongs to China, which controls 80% of the world’s solar panel supply chain. For years China has been investing heavily in renewable energy, and is expected to spend a staggering $675bn in 2024, according to an International Energy Agency (IEA) report. To compete, governments around the world have begun throwing hundreds of billions at the green industries of the future. In the EU, investment in clean energy is set to increase to $370bn in 2024, according to the IEA. The predicted figure for the US is $315bn. US Trade Representative Katherine Tai said last year that she hoped the US’s increased spending on renewable energy would help address the “significant distortion” in the global economy caused by China.

Getty Images The former Honda site in Swindon will become a warehousing and logistics facility

Amid a vast expanse of rubble, dust and noise, a green crane yanks away at a corrugated roof like a frustrated dentist attempting to extract a particularly stubborn wisdom tooth. Swindon’s Honda factory - once one of the world’s most advanced car factories - is being demolished, three decades after it opened. This used to be one of the fastest-growing towns in Europe. It was one of the jewels in the crown of investments attracted to the UK by Margaret Thatcher’s brand of 1980s enterprise. Swindon voted for her, John Major, Tony Blair, David Cameron, Theresa May and Boris Johnson. It was also one of the first towns to declare for Brexit, by 55%. But last year, its council changed hands to Labour. The council has had to continue to accelerate cuts to local services, passing a budget with record cuts in order to stave off bankruptcy. Inflation, rising care expenses, and central government grant squeezes meant cuts to libraries, the Dial-a-Ride community transport service and dimmed street lights. There has been an almost 5% rise in council tax. The council leader has warned any further cuts will affect frontline services. What is happening in Swindon is a visible consequence of sluggish long-term economic growth. Government spending cuts, low private investment, deindustrialisation and shrinking disposable income have left scars even on what was one of the UK’s famous boom towns.

The Honda site is set to become a warehousing and logistics facility. In another world, it would have been replaced by another major global manufacturer. Tesla, for example, was invited. Whereas five years ago the promise was to level up left-behind Northern towns, places like Swindon feel levelled down. The question about growth arising in this town is vital to whoever wins Thursday’s election. Elsewhere in the world, sites like this are being repurposed for electric car manufacturing. The Americans are pouring public money into their factories to try to compete with China, who will soon be confirmed as the world’s biggest car exporter. Emerging economies from Indonesia to Vietnam to Turkey are also investing in and growing their car industries. Indeed it was to Turkey that the entire Honda production line, including dozens of never-used industrial robots, was packed up and shipped off via the M4 and Bristol port last year. Swindon is not just about Honda. It is part of the M4 corridor where there are plenty of jobs in the knowledge sectors, and in finance, for example at the headquarters of Nationwide. The overall unemployment rate is just 2.6%, but the number of people not in work and not looking for work is 18%.

Faisal Islam joined Gary Huett, who contacted the BBC as part of the Your Voice, Your Vote election project, for a bike ride around Swindon

Marcus Kittridge, a former Honda engineer who now runs a cafe in the centre of town with his wife Tracey, accepts there are still “good employment prospects” but says many are at or “50p above” minimum wage, and says this has contributed to a decline in disposable income in the centre of town. “It’s like a Northern town that lost its industry in the 1970s,” he tells me. They now shut the cafe at 14:00 every day because of the high price of energy. He expects to be passing on his rising costs in higher prices for the next year or two. They have also stopped selling smoothies, after a notable decline in the availability and quality of fresh fruit, which they blame on post-Brexit changes. “We were told the quality of food was going to go up after Brexit, I can tell you now it has not. I’ve barely heard any politician mention it, but it definitely has had an impact on us,” Tracey says. Might she have been a bit unlucky with her purchases of fresh produce? “If I’m unlucky, I’m getting unlucky every single day and I’m probably the unluckiest person on earth,” she says. Their experience shows that some of the undercurrents of sluggish long-term growth - high energy prices, low disposable income, low investment, and new trade barriers can combine in unusual ways.

Gary Huett, a retired graphic designer also from Swindon who got in touch as part of the BBC's Your Voice, Your Vote project inviting you to tell us what matters, wanted to know why Swindon’s town centre looked like it was “rotting” and asked if anything could change. “We’ve now got pound shops predominantly, and the thriving night scene, packed with the yuppy set in the 1980s and 1990s has gone and decayed.”

Gary Huett wants to know why Swindon's town centre looks like it is ""rotting""

The Conservatives say green shoots are already here. The latest growth figures for January to March show the UK now has the fastest growing economy in the G7 group of advanced economies, after last year’s brief recession. Swindon’s jobs record remains strong. On the Honda site, new investment has come, and the jobs, albeit in warehousing rather than manufacturing, will return. For Labour, Swindon - a bellwether town where residents have voted the same way as the eventual national winner for the last 40 years - shows that there are no quick fixes. They are not competing with the US or European Union (EU) with big public investments in green energy. Council spending remains unprotected and subject to the same ongoing squeeze. A looser planning regime might help build more houses or expand the solar farms that dot the countryside around the town. But the job of transformation is very real. When asked what will happen if the economy does not grow, Labour has responded by saying some variation of “I’m not defeatist” or “we can do it”. When I interviewed shadow chancellor Rachel Reeves in Swindon, I said that if she was relying on planning changes to transform growth prospects, they were going to have to be a revolutionary, almost Thatcher-style ""Big Bang"". She told me: “It’s big reform we are offering… unless we grow the economy we’re going to be stuck in a doom loop of low growth, high taxes and poor public services.” Labour’s hope is that there is a tsunami of private investment that has been held back from this country due to political and economic instability. That, the party says, can be unleashed by the tens of billions with a strong and stable pro-growth government.","Swindon’s Honda factory - once one of the world’s most advanced car factories - is being demolished, three decades after it opened.

Marks & Spencer is launching a new service for clothing repairs and alterations. From August, customers will be able to book through a dedicated online hub and have their fixed items posted back to them within seven to ten days. The work will be carried out by Deliveroo-style repairs start-up Sojo, and its in-house team of tailors, with prices starting at £5. The move comes as retailers try to encourage more sustainable habits among their shoppers.

Sojo launched during the Covid-19 pandemic in 2021 with a mission to make repairing, not simply replacing, clothing more mainstream. M&S said its partnership with Sojo aimed to provide customers with ways to extend the life of their clothing. “Through the launch of our repair service, we’re making it even easier for customers to give their clothes Another life, whether they are using our new repair service or long-standing clothes recycling scheme,"" said Richard Price, managing director of clothing & home at M&S.

Sojo's Josephine Philips wants to make repairing clothes more mainstream

Josephine Philips, Sojo's founder and chief executive, said the partnership marked ""an incredibly big step"" towards its mission of making clothes repairs more accessible. Siobhan Gehin, a retail expert and senior partner at consulting firm Roland Berger, told the BBC that by partnering with smaller, independent repair firms, large brands can provide customers with convenient alterations without having to create the infrastructure for these services themselves.

Growing trend among retailers

M&S is not alone in looking to repair services as a way to seemingly embrace and encourage sustainability. In January, Sojo took up a permanent space in Selfridges on London’s Oxford Street to provide customers with access to its clothing repairs service. The central London department store also gives shoppers access to handbag and trainer restoration services. Japanese fashion retailer Uniqlo, perhaps best known for its viral shoulder bag, offers clothing repairs and additional services such as embroidery for Uniqlo items at six of its UK stores. John Lewis has made its fashion rental service and recycling scheme a key part of its consumer-facing sustainability strategy, alongside accepting and reselling pre-loved products such as electronics and furniture. High Street stores Primark and H&M provide customers with online guides for repairing and maintaining their clothes, such as how to sew buttons and zips on to items or rework them entirely. Primark has also held free repair workshops for customers across the UK and Europe since 2022.

2 days ago Share

BBC

The computer expert who helped build the faulty Horizon software has finally spoken under oath about his involvement in the Post Office scandal. Gareth Jenkins is a key figure, having appeared as an expert witness to defend Horizon in court cases, and is now at the centre of an alleged cover-up. His appearance at the inquiry was long-awaited after being postponed twice. He gave evidence over four days - the longest run of questions any witness has faced - and gave his version of events. Here are five key moments from his evidence.

1. He thought Horizon bugs were fixed quickly

Gareth Jenkins referred to Horizon's overall reliability throughout his testimony, even challenging findings from the landmark Bates v Post Office case that identified issues with the IT system. He acknowledged ""individual problems"" affecting specific branches but asserted that, as a whole, the system was ""working well"". When questioned about bugs, Mr Jenkins admitted lacking personal knowledge of all known issues, stating he typically became involved when drafted in for problem resolution. When pressed on how he could provide court evidence without full oversight of existing problems, Mr Jenkins said: ""Bugs impacting accounts were rare. Monitoring was in place, and fixes were prompt. Therefore, live system problems were rare, making me confident in its operation."" He claimed nobody from the Post Office alerted him to unknown issues, and he didn't actively seek information about bugs he wasn't involved in fixing. Mr Jenkins admitted not realising the need for comprehensive knowledge when giving evidence and ""with hindsight would have done things differently"".

2. He was sent expert witness rules

Mr Jenkins was an “expert witness” in several prosecutions brought by the Post Office. His duty was to the courts, not the Post Office or his employer Fujitsu. His role meant disclosing any relevant information about the Horizon software – even evidence that could help sub-postmasters' cases. Lawyers should have ensured that Mr Jenkins understood this. When asked about this by Mr Beer, Mr Jenkins stated that he didn’t know about his responsibilities until the end of 2020. But Mr Beer showed him a letter from November 2005, written by lawyers working for the Post Office. The letter mentioned that he was an expert witness and, according to Mr Beer, listed his duties in an “easy-to-understand way”. After initially denying he had received it, Mr Jenkins later accepted that it was sent to him. He said he had “no recollection of having been briefed” on his duties and had “clearly forgotten” about having seen the letter.

3. He knew remote access was possible

The former ""distinguished engineer"" faced intense questioning regarding remote access – the ability of Fujitsu staff to modify sub-postmaster branch accounts without their knowledge. In his 2010 witness statement for Seema Misra's trial, he stated: ""No external systems can manipulate branch accounts without user awareness and authorisation."" During the inquiry, Mr Jenkins accepted knowing that remote access was possible but believed it happened infrequently and left a visible trail. He based this view on ""informal chats"" with other Fujitsu IT staff. The former engineer told the inquiry that he only discovered the extent of unrestricted access Fujitsu technical staff had to sub-postmaster accounts during the 2018 High Court battle.

4. He was a 'willing actor' for the Post Office

In 2005, Mr Jenkins was asked to provide a draft witness statement in the case of sub-postmaster Noel Thomas. The Post Office wanted his thoughts on how the losses could have occurred. One possibility, he said, was some sort of system failure. But the Post Office demanded changes, saying the line was potentially “very damaging"". It got deleted. The inquiry heard he was a “willing actor” in this process. He said he was happy with the changes he ended up with as it still accurately reflected what had happened but used “less emotive words"". The Post Office was applying the pressure, but he never checked with his own Fujitsu lawyers about signing off evidence that had been toned down. Earlier he was asked to explain attempts to “tweak” his statements, but Mr Jenkins believed this was more of a “tidying up” to make them easier to read. He said he pushed back when the changes went too far.

5. He was 'better with systems than people'

Four days of forensic questioning meant plenty of room for big revelations. It also meant Gareth Jenkins had nowhere to hide. It was very revealing about the character of the man who has been mentioned so many times at this inquiry. An IT specialist who spent his entire career at one company, by his own admission, he dealt “better with systems than people”. He would have been happiest engineering and designing, but found himself entangled in something very different. Something, he argues, he didn't fully understand. ""Can't you use the report I have already sent you?"" Mr Jenkins wrote to a Post Office lawyer in 2012. It is clear he was viewing the growing number of legal queries as a confusing frustration, taking him away from the tech front line. It is an annoyance that hasn't gone away. At one point, Mr Jenkins told the inquiry chair he wanted this ""over with"". Given the ongoing investigations, that seems unlikely.","What we learned from IT expert at Post Office inquiry2 days ago ShareBBCThe computer expert who helped build the faulty Horizon software has finally spoken under oath about his involvement in the Post Office scandal.

3 days ago By Lora Jones , Business reporter, BBC News Share

Lawyers acting on behalf of two people who fell ill in an E. coli outbreak in the UK have started legal action against two leading supermarkets. Law firm Fieldfisher said on Friday it had issued letters of claim for breach of the Consumer Protection Act over own-brand sandwiches purchased in Tesco and Asda. The claims for compensation relate to a man from the South East and an 11-year-old girl in the North West. One person in England has died linked to the ongoing E. coli outbreak, the UK Health Security Agency said on Thursday, although they had underlying health conditions. The E. coli outbreak is thought to be caused by some supermarket sandwiches containing salad leaves. The large majority of cases reported so far developed symptoms before 4 June and the number of cases being reported is now falling, offering hope the outbreak may have ended. Several food manufacturers recalled some of their products as a precaution. The Food Standards Agency said lettuce is the likely source, based on tests.

Fieldfisher said the claim against Asda related to a young girl who contracted E. coli after eating an own-brand chicken salad sandwich from the supermarket. ""The girl, aged 11, developed the serious condition haemolytic uraemic syndrome (HUS), which attacks the kidneys and has been on dialysis for three weeks,"" it said. ""She was discharged home two days ago but could be at risk of permanent kidney damage. Her mother bought three of the sandwiches as part of an online delivery."" An Asda spokesman said that it had not yet received any letter from Fieldfisher regarding these claims, but added: ""As soon as we do we will review the details of the claim as a matter of urgency."" Harvinder Kaur, a director at Fieldfisher, told the PA News agency earlier on Friday that she had issued a separate letter to Tesco on behalf of a man from the South East. He was also hospitalised with E. coli symptoms after eating Tesco-branded sandwiches containing salad, the law firm claims. ""Luckily, this client did not go on to develop HUS and is now home, but for a time he was seriously ill,"" she said. ""Under the Act, companies producing food must ensure it is safe to eat. ""If it causes illness, it is a breach of their duty and those injured are eligible to claim compensation, not least to fund possible ongoing medical care."" She added that the man was a ""regular shopper"" at Tesco, buying his lunch there most weekdays as it was very close to his work. The BBC understands Tesco has yet to receive the letter from Fieldfisher.

23 hours ago By Angie Brown , BBC Scotland, Edinburgh and East reporter Share

BBC Jakub Parulski, who lives with his wife and two young daughters, said they were in a 'horror story'

Residents of affordable housing developments in Edinburgh have said they are ""living in a horror story"" after being hit with a massive rise in their gas bill as costs are beginning to fall across the rest of the country. The Harvester's Way development has 180 properties which are all connected to a district heating system, where one huge gas boiler provides heating and hot water to all the homes. It is billed as a greener and more efficient way to heat their homes but it also means residents are unable to shop around for the best prices. Places For People Scotland, which operates about 1,000 homes across five sites in Edinburgh, has told residents the tariff for gas will jump 450% from 1 August, meaning people in a two-bedroom flat could be paying as much as £400 a month. It said the new heat tariff was procured at the end of last year and reflected the market conditions at the time. The unit price for gas can vary significantly and energy companies also impose standing charges, but the average UK unit price is currently just above 7p per kWh. The Harvester's Way residents were paying 4p/kWh but that is increasing to 22.18p/kWh.

Some of the residents from People For Places developments in Edinburgh who say they cannot pay their new gas bill prices

Jakub Parulski, who lives on the development with his wife Kasia and two young daughters, said his monthly gas bill will rise from £60 to £350. He said: ""These properties were aimed at affordable housing for low income families, this is not affordable by any means and we are very anxious about this. ""The problem is we can't boycott paying because we have pre-payment, pay-as-you go meters so they have us locked. ""We have no choice. The only choice we have is if we go cold with our small kids in the property."" The low carbon heating and hot water district heat network has a smart valve in each home linking payments to access to heating and hot water. As long as their account is in credit, the valve will remain open and they have access to heating and hot water. If an account runs out of credit, the valve closes until a top-up payment is made. Mr Parulski said he would not be able to sell his house because no-one would buy a property with such a high gas tariff. ""We are absolutely devastated. We are going to be locked in properties we cannot afford,"" he said. ""People will lose their homes. Some of us are looking at being homeless, some of us are nosediving into poverty. ""It is impossible now for us to sell our properties. We feel trapped and this is beginning to be a horror story and is no joke for a lot of us. ""It is really desperate.""

Henda Sankareh said she got the ""fright of her life"" at the new gas prices

The price rise was first introduced in April but delayed after residents complained. They told BBC Scotland the first they knew about their tariff changing was when credit in their pay-as-you-go meters suddenly dropped overnight. When Henda Sankareh noticed she had no hot water to wash her four-month-old baby at her rented flat on the Harvester's Way development she thought the boiler was broken. So the mother-of-two called the managers running the development to report the fault. But the 30-year-old said she got the ""fright of her life"" when they told her there was no problem with the heating and instead she had just run out of credit. She checked her meter and was shocked to see her monthly instalment had disappeared in less than a week. She said: ""They just told me the price had gone up so I needed to put more money in the meter. ""That's when I got into a panic. All the money had gone in just five days. I had had no notice or letter or email to warn me.""

Scott Walker with his wife Samantha and daughter Molly

After residents complained they had been given no warning Places for People Scotland launched an investigation. The company agreed to pay the higher tariff bill until the end of July but then residents would be locked into the new rates until the end of March 2025. In a letter to residents, it said: ""The procurement process requires us to adhere to terms and conditions known as the deed of conditions, which states we must get at least five cost quotes for price comparison before agreeing on a provider. ""Due to difficulties in finding gas suppliers for district heating, many providers chose not to participate."" Scott Walker, 50, a quality control technician living on the Harvester's Way development, said: ""I got a fright and felt very angry when I did the figures in my head and realised this was impossible to pay. ""We can't afford to move. He added: ""When we bought this house we were told this heating system was really efficient. ""We need to try to reduce the tariff. Obviously it has to go up but not that kind of percentage. It's extortionate. We would take a normal price that everyone else pays. ""I want to get an independent review done of the heating system and how they have come to these figures.""

The economy grew by more than initially estimated in the first three months of 2024 as the UK emerged from recession, revised official figures show.

Between January and March, the economy grew by 0.7% the Office for National Statistics (ONS) said.

Figures released last month initially estimated growth had been 0.6%.

The strength of the economy has been a central battleground in the general election campaign, with growth having been sluggish in recent years.

Most economists, politicians and businesses want to see GDP rising steadily, because it usually means people are spending more, extra jobs are created, more tax is paid to the government and workers get better pay rises.

The original figure for the first quarter of the year was stronger than economists had expected, and growth in the services sector, which includes businesses such as hairdressers, banks, and hospitality, helped to push it higher, the ONS said.

But while services growth was revised upwards, increases in manufacturing were revised down on the back of more data being collected.

Due to the upward revision, the UK was the fastest growing economy in the G7 group of countries with advanced economies in the first three months of this year.

Prime Minister and Conservative leader Rishi Sunak hailed the new revised growth and said his party had a ""clear plan to deliver a more secure future for your family"".

But Labour accused the Conservatives of ""14 years economic vandalism"", which it said had left people worse off.

""A Labour government will grow the economy and show Britain is open for business with a plan for growth, so that we can put money back in people’s pockets,"" said a spokesperson.

Sarah Olney, Liberal Democrat Treasury spokesperson, said despite the upward revision, the figures would ""come as cold comfort for families being hammered by spiralling mortgage repayments, unfair stealth taxes and the cost of a weekly food shop going through the roof"".","UK economy grew more than estimated in early 2024The economy grew by more than initially estimated in the first three months of 2024 as the UK emerged from recession, revised official figures show.

3 days ago By Mark Palmer , BBC News Share

Getty Images The company had originally planned to shut down one of the blast furnaces by the end of June and the second by September

Workers at Tata Steel have been told the company is taking steps to potentially cease operations at much of the Port Talbot plant by 7 July because of a strike by the trade union Unite. The company had originally been planning to shut one of the blast furnaces by the end of June and the second one by September. But Port Talbot workers have been told that because of the strike from 8 July, the company can no longer be assured of sufficient resources being available to ensure safe and stable operations. The Unite union said Tata's statement to shut or pause the blast furnaces three months earlier than intended was the latest in a long line of threats and it would not deter them. The Welsh government said it cannot and will not support the closure of both blast furnaces.

Last week the Unite union announced that about 1,500 workers would begin an indefinite strike on 8 July over the company's plans to cut thousands of jobs. Onay Kasab, the national lead for Unite, told Radio Wales Breakfast that the union was due to have a conversation with the company regarding safety during the strike. Mr Kasab denied if the union had given the company an opportunity to shut the site. ""What other option have we got when we are facing 2,800 job losses. We have said to Tata, again and again, 'wait for a general election, wait for a new Labour government'"" he said. Mr Kasab said the union have a letter from the company asking the union to wait until after the general election for discussions to take place. However, the company previously said it would not be changing course in Port Talbot, regardless of who wins the general election. About 2,800 Tata Steel workers will lose their jobs when the company closes both blast furnaces in Port Talbot by the end of September. At the time, the company said if the strike affected the safety or stability of its operations it would be ""forced"" to accelerate closure plans. A spokesperson for Tata said: ""Following the announcement by Unite union to unilaterally call strike action from 8 July, Tata Steel is unfortunately forced to commence legal action to challenge the validity of Unite's ballot. ""In the coming days, if we cannot be certain that we are able to continue to safely and stably operate our assets through the period of strike action, we will not have any choice but to pause or stop heavy end operations [including both blast furnaces] on the Port Talbot site. ""That is not a decision we would take lightly, and we recognise that it would prove extremely costly and disruptive throughout the supply chain, but the safety of people on or around our sites will always take priority over everything else."" Tata said it is again calling on Unite to withdraw its industrial action and join Community and GMB unions in ""giving consideration"" to the company's proposal, which Tata said includes ""generous employee support packages, training and skills development"". It said it ""understands"" the impact the restructuring will have on many employees and contractors, but that it ""remains committed to a just transition"" and hopes for a ""long and sustainable future"" in the UK. The company plans to build a £1.25bn electric arc furnace to produce steel in a way which is less polluting than traditional blast furnaces but requires fewer workers. Tata said the move would secure the future of steelmaking at the site and the UK government is contributing £500m towards the cost of the project. The plans for the site will see both furnaces shut down. Number five will go off by the end of next week as planned while four is due to go off by the end of September. Preparatory work to shut down five will begin by 1 July if the strike goes ahead. Other elements that will close include the harbour, sinter plant, ore yards and primary steelmaking.

PA Media Unite union workers are protesting against Tata Steel's plans to cut 2,800 jobs

Sharon Graham, the Unite general secretary, said the union is ""fighting for the future of the steel industry"". She said Unite has secured ""serious investment"" from Labour to safeguard jobs. ""Tata putting out a statement to shut or pause its blast furnaces three months earlier than they intended to is the latest in a long line of threats that won't deter us. ""The Unite campaign is not about selling jobs, it's about securing the long-term future of steel making in this country for thousands of workers in Port Talbot and South Wales."" Unite said it is calling on the ""real decision makers"" in Mumbai to realise that ""the investment secured will be good for the company and workers."" GMB union said Tata must ""step back"" from this ""irreversible decision"" and instead ""safeguard steelmaking assets"". GMB national officer, Charlotte Brumpton-Childs, said that the upcoming general election could ""change so much"", and that GMB's next actions would be decided by its members. The Community union condemned Tata's ""unacceptable"" decision to bring forward the closure and said it continued to support the Labour Party's call for Tata not to make irreversible decisions before the general election.

Analysis by Ben Price, BBC Wales News

Developments have escalated quickly in the past two weeks. Unite is one of three unions which represents steelworkers and it has so far been the most militant in its action in the face of significant job cuts across Tata’s UK operations. Members are currently working to rule and there’s a ban on any overtime. However, the decision to walk out indefinitely is an escalation which now potentially threatens the early closure of the UK’s largest steelmaking operation in Port Talbot. Tata says it would have no option but to close if the strike goes ahead, but in the meantime the company has filed for an injunction at the High Court to try to prevent the strike happening. It suggests Unite’s ballot on industrial action wasn’t carried out properly. With the action due on 8 July, Tata will need a ruling quickly. The other unions, Community and GMB, say they’ll wait until after the general election before deciding whether to strike too. But having spoken to a number of steelworkers in Port Talbot, the sense is that many don’t want a strike which could cost them the current offer on the table from the company. What happens during the course of the next week could be crucial to the future of thousands of livelihoods, although Tata says no redundancies will be made until the end of September, regardless.

Workers and local people have protested about the closure plans

First Minister Vaughan Gething described the news from Tata as ""extraordinary"" and urged the company to wait for the result of next week's general election. In a statement, Mr Gething said: ""The news that Tata could switch off blast furnaces four and five at Port Talbot next week is extraordinary and will cause huge anxiety for the workforce, their families and the community. ""The Welsh government cannot and will not support the closure of both blast furnaces"". He added that acting whilst the nation went to the polls did not help de-escalate matters. Samuel Kurtz, the Welsh Conservative shadow minister for economy and energy,said it was ""disappointing news that will cause additional distress to communities already dealing with enough as it is"". ""Tata have shown no goodwill to their workforce at what is an anxious time. “The Welsh Labour government have also only paid lip service to Tata's workforce, failing to contribute a penny to the transition board, and UK Labour's manifesto says nothing on what it would do differently to support Port Talbot's steelworkers,"" he added. Luke Fletcher, Plaid Cymru's economy spokesperson, said steel should be brought under the control of the next UK government, which Plaid believes will be led by Sir Keir Starmer. Mr Fletcher said: ""The time has come now for an incoming Labour government to put words into action on steel. ""Save our steel is no good as just a slogan, if we are going to save our steel, nationalisation needs to happen on day one.""","The Welsh government said it cannot and will not support the closure of both blast furnaces.
However, the company previously said it would not be changing course in Port Talbot, regardless of who wins the general election.
About 2,800 Tata Steel workers will lose their jobs when the company closes both blast furnaces in Port Talbot by the end of September.
A spokesperson for Tata said: ""Following the announcement by Unite union to unilaterally call strike action from 8 July, Tata Steel is unfortunately forced to commence legal action to challenge the validity of Unite's ballot.
However, the decision to walk out indefinitely is an escalation which now potentially threatens the early closure of the UK’s largest steelmaking operation in Port Talbot.","['shut', 'unite', 'steel',

3 days ago Share

Getty Images Aer Lingus have now cancelled almost 400 flights

Aer Lingus has confirmed it is cancelling a further 122 flights up until 7 July due to the ongoing industrial action by pilots. The airline has now cancelled almost 400 flights as a result of an indefinite work-to-rule and strike action by pilots. The work-to-rule means not working over time or carrying out any other out-of-hours duties. An eight-hour strike from 05:00 -13:00 local time is planned for Saturday. Aer Lingus said that due to the “indefinite nature” of Irish Air Line Pilots' Association pilots’ industrial action it “must cancel” additional flights up to 7 July.

RTE Dublin Airport on the first day of industrial action

Irish broadcaster RTÉ had reported that the recommendation for an additional strike was made by IALPA on Thursday. However, on Friday afternoon, Capt Mark Tighe, president of the union, said that Ireland's Labour Court has invited both parties in the dispute to return to them on Monday afternoon. ""We are in the process of discussing that and that of course would have relevance to whether or not we escalate the industrial action,"" he told Radio Ulster's Evening Extra programme. ""I’m hoping now that they have noted the seriousness of the situation and that they’ll be able to apply their considerable expertise."" Talks between it and Aer Lingus to resolve the ongoing pay dispute broke down without a resolution on Thursday.

School pupils 'slept on floor'

A group of students and teachers from Shimna Integrated School in County Down who were retuning from a trip to Berlin had their flight home cancelled while they were in the airport. Teacher Luke McWatters, said that their 21:45 flight on Thursday was initially showing as delayed and then, more than two hours after the flight was initially due to take off, they were told it was cancelled. “Trying to ring through to Aer Lingus I was on three different calls to three different agents who, every time I got to a certain way through said: ‘Because you’re a group we can’t do anything for you -you have to contact group Aer Lingus who don’t open until 9am’.” Mr McWatters told the BBC’s Evening Extra programme that he felt they had been “left high and dry”, with no offer of accommodation or food.

Luke McWatters Luke McWatters said support from the airline ""fell short"" of what was expected

He said the group slept on the airport floor. Mr McWatters said they were offered an alternative flight on 1 July. “At that stage we made the call to try other airlines and split ourselves up as a group,” he added. Half of the group travelled to Edinburgh, while the other half caught a flight to Poland, with both groups booked on flights back to Ireland on Friday. Mr McWatters said that the support for Aer Lingus had “fallen very short of what you would expect from a major airline dealing with children”. The BBC has contacted Aer Lingus for a response.

'Reasonable pay claim'

Capt Tighe said ""passengers are extremely dear to us as pilots. Management don’t meet you, we do every day. ""We’ve been left in a position where our pay is being eroded and all we’re looking to do is maintain our pay."" Speaking to BBC News NI's Good Morning Ulster programme on Friday, Capt Tighe said in an effort to resolve the dispute, the union had said it would accept less than an inflationary rise. ""We don’t believe anybody should be getting less than inflation, but yesterday in an effort to resolve this, we said we would accept less than inflation."" However, he added: ""We believe inflation is a very reasonable claim in this current time.""

PA Media IALPA President Capt Mark Tighe said the Labour Court has invited both sides to further discussions on Monday

Additional strike action?

IALPA had recommended to trade union Fórsa that the additional strike should be longer than the action planned for Saturday, RTÉ has reported. If sanctioned, Fórsa will have to give seven days’ notice to Aer Lingus before pilots can stop work. Aer Lingus has described the potential of further strike action as ""entirely inappropriate given the request of the Labour Court this week that the dispute should not be escalated"". Donal Moriarty, Aer Lingus' chief corporate affairs officer, said the airline is ""willing to go back to the Labour Court on a formal joint referral basis"". He said Aer Lingus has encouraged IALPA and Fórsa to ""agree to this step"".

How many Aer Lingus flights have been cancelled?

All Aer Lingus UK regional flights, operated by Emerald Airlines, and Aer Lingus UK transatlantic flights to and from Manchester will operate as scheduled. A full list of cancelled flights can be found on the airline's website.

How much are Aer Lingus pilots paid?

Co-pilots can start out at about €36,000 (£30,400), with packages increasing based on actual flying hours. Irish broadcaster RTÉ has reported a captain at the top of the scale can be paid about €287,000 (£242,000). Capt Mark Tighe explained on Thursday that this can take up to 26 years. There are differences for pilots depending on whether flights are short or long-haul.

3 days ago By Tom Espiner , BBC business reporter Share

BBC

Former Fujitsu engineer and Horizon expert Gareth Jenkins has said he didn't think the software was ""a monster"" and that he was ""trapped into doing things I shouldn't have done"". Speaking at an inquiry into the Horizon scandal, Mr Jenkins was accused by lawyer Flora Page of ""protecting"" it when he gave evidence as an expert witness between 2010 and 2013. Ms Page represents Horizon victims including former sub-postmaster Seema Misra, who Mr Jenkins gave evidence against in 2010. Ms Misra told the BBC the system was a monster which ""had blood on its hands, and so do the people who protect [it]"".

Between 1999 and 2015, the Post Office prosecuted hundreds of sub-postmasters on the strength of faulty Horizon data, with 700 convicted of offences such as theft and false accounting. Horizon falsely flagged discrepancies in accounts, with many sub-postmasters using their own savings to make good the imaginary shortfalls. The wrongful prosecutions, which have been called one of the biggest British miscarriages of justice, had a devastating effect on the lives of the sub-postmasters affected. They faced financial ruin and the loss of standing in their communities. Some sub-postmasters ended up taking their own lives after being pursued by the Post Office for supposed losses, including Martin Griffiths, whose widow was later paid in instalments by the Post Office for her silence, the inquiry heard in April.

Giving his fourth day of evidence at the inquiry into the Horizon scandal, Mr Jenkins was questioned by Ms Page, a barrister who represented Horizon victims including Seema Misra. Ms Misra was pregnant with her second child when she was convicted of theft and sent to jail in 2010. She later told the BBC she would have killed herself had she not been pregnant at the time. In a charged atmosphere at the hearing, with Ms Misra sitting next to her, Ms Page accused Mr Jenkins of being a ""Fujitsu man"". She said Mr Jenkins ""knew the Misra trial was a test case for Horizon"". Ms Page alleged his role was to make sure Horizon had a ""clean bill of health"" and that he had ""tailored"" his evidence accordingly. ""My role was to tell the truth,"" Mr Jenkins said. ""I attempted to answer as best I could the questions I was asked"". Ms Page responded: ""Never mind whether a by-product of protecting the monster was that a woman was sent to jail"". Mr Jenkins said he was ""sorry for had happened to Mrs Misra"" but he felt that was down the to way that the Post Office had behaved and wasn't ""purely down to me"". ""I clearly got trapped into doing things I shouldn't have done, but that was not intentional on my behalf,"" he said.

Mr Jenkins was part of the Fujitsu team that developed the Horizon software, and part of his role was dealing with bugs in the system. Mr Jenkins has maintained throughout his evidence that he didn't understand his previous duties as an expert witness to tell the court about problems with Horizon, and that he didn't know that he shouldn't just narrowly answer questions about the technology. Under questioning at the inquiry on Friday, Mr Jenkins said: ""I appreciate that I got things very wrong, but it was done through ignorance rather than maliciousness"". He added that the Horizon system ""as a whole was working well"". Mr Jenkins is currently being investigated by the Metropolitan Police on suspicion of perjury - lying to a court, and perverting the course of justice. No criminal charges have been brought.","Fujitsu expert: I didn't think Horizon was a monster3 days ago By Tom Espiner , BBC business reporter ShareBBCFormer Fujitsu engineer and Horizon expert Gareth Jenkins has said he didn't think the software was ""a monster"" and that he was ""trapped into doing things I shouldn't have done"".

Thousands of UK bank customers were hit by payment problems affecting some of the biggest High Street lenders on Friday.

Banks including HSBC, Nationwide, Barclays and Virgin Money were all affected by issues with a system that operates payments between individuals and firms.

The group overseeing the payments system said the issue causing the problems has now been fixed, and the payment backlog has been cleared.

However, several people have told the BBC they are still facing issues, with some saying they now have little cash left.

The timing of the glitches was particularly problematic given the last Friday of the month is when many salaried staff are usually paid.

Many people also have to pay bills around this time.

""My bills are bouncing and I can’t pay for a train ticket I need in the next hour,"" said one customer on X.

Another said customers deserved compensation for the ""inconvenience on people’s pay day"".

""We all have bills to pay,"" they added.

Ryan, from Telford, who did not want his surname to be used, said he had not received his wages and as a result has £12 to his name.

The 29-year-old engineer said bills had started to be declined on his account.

""I’m supposed to be moving home next week and my savings have been emptied for deposits and rent,"" he said.

The BBC understands that the banks were affected by issues to Faster Payments, a system that operates ""under the bonnet"" of the UK financial system.

It aims to make sure real-time payments between millions of individuals and businesses are made seemingly instantly.

Pay UK, which oversees the system, said: ""We are aware that a small number of Faster Payments were delayed or not processed earlier today.

""Working with our infrastructure provider, this technical issue has been fixed.""

It then added later that ""payments have returned to normal and the backlog is resolved"".

However, some banking customers have disputed this, telling the BBC they have still yet to receive their salary payments.

HSBC, Nationwide, Barclays and Virgin Media had all apologised earlier for the delays to payments.

This is not the first time High Street lenders' services have been hit by problems.

Nationwide customers faced similar issues in March, while HSBC customers suffered an outage lasting over 24 hours in November.","Major UK high street banks say payment issues fixedThousands of UK bank customers were hit by payment problems affecting some of the biggest High Street lenders on Friday.

Nike shares plunged more than 12% in after hours trading

Nike has said it expects a surprise 10% drop in quarterly revenue, as it faces growing competition from newer rivals such as On and Hoka.

The news sent Nike shares plunging more than 12% in after hours trading, which could mean a loss of $15bn in market value if the losses hold on Friday.

The world's largest sportswear company also told investors it is facing weakening demand in international markets, including in China.

But Nike is optimistic that new products and a marketing campaign at the upcoming Olympic Games in Paris will help the company regain momentum with consumers.

""The Paris Olympics offers us a pinnacle moment to communicate our vision of sport to the world,"" CEO John Donahoe said on the earnings call.

The company also lowered its outlook for the 2025 fiscal year.

It said direct-to-consumer business declined 8%, as some customers went for more trendy upstart brands.

""There's a sense that Nike just hasn't innovated enough, it hasn't marketed enough, it hasn't told enough stories around its products,"" the Managing director of GlobalData Retail, Neil Saunders, told the BBC.

The sportswear giant's strategy to sell its products through its own stores and website instead of wholesales like Foot Locker hurt sales, Reuters said.

""Nike needs to get on the front foot again in terms of persuading people to buy its products,"" Mr Saunders added.

Prosecutors say through their actions the employees avoided losses ranging from $24,000 to more than$108,000.

Three employees of subsidiaries of HYBE, the agency behind K-pop superstars BTS, have been charged with insider trading by South Korean prosecutors.

They are being accused of selling shares in the agency before BTS members announced they were taking a break on 14 June, 2022.

The announcement sent HYBE shares plunging 25% when markets opened, resulting in a loss in market value of nearly 2 trillion won ($1.4bn; £1.1bn).

The prosecutors said the three employees acted with prior knowledge of what was about to happen, avoiding losses ranging from $24,000 to more than $108,000.

At the time, many analysts speculated about the reasons for the hiatus, with some saying the band members would have to attend South Korea's mandatory 18-month military service.

South Korea is still technically at war with North Korea, so nearly all able-bodied men are obliged to enlist for 18 months by the time they turn 28.

All members of the band would end up being drafted in the months and years that followed.

The oldest member of the hit boy band, Jin, was discharged earlier this month after completing his service.

The other six - J-Hope, V, RM, Jimin, Jung Kook and Suga - are still serving and the band is expected to reunite only in June 2025.

An electric car battery developed by UK start-up Nyobolt has successfully charged from 10% to 80% in four minutes and 37 seconds in its first live demonstration.

It was achieved with a specially-built concept sports car on a test track in Bedford, and is part of industry-wide efforts to get electric vehicles (EVs) charging more quickly.

By comparison, an existing Tesla supercharger can charge a car battery to 80% in 15-20 minutes.

Experts say eliminating so-called ""range anxiety"" is key to increasing uptake of EVs - but also stress the importance of improving the charging infrastructure.

“Developing technology that enables people to charge more quickly, which chimes with the time it currently takes to re-fuel a car – is really important,"" Paul Shearing, Professor of Sustainable Energy Engineering at Oxford University, told the BBC.

But he added there needed to be more chargers of all types.

“People are going to want fast-charging infrastructure, independent of what car they’re using – everyone wants to do this more quickly,” he said.

The sports car the Nyobolt battery was fitted to - which was tested over two days this week - achieved a range of 120 miles after four minutes

3 days ago By Natalie Sherman , BBC News Share

EPA Campaigners and family members of those who have died of opioids outside the US Supreme Court

The US Supreme Court has struck down a part of the bankruptcy deal for Purdue Pharma that would have shielded members of the Sackler family from future lawsuits over their role in fuelling the opioid crisis. The Sacklers, who owned and operated the Oxycontin-maker for decades, had agreed to pay $6bn (£4.7bn) towards a wider settlement in exchange for sweeping protections against civil claims related to the addictive opioid. But the nation's top court ruled that granting such protections to the Sacklers, who did not themselves declare bankruptcy was not authorised under law. Sackler family members said they would continue to push for a settlement, warning that the alternative was ""costly and chaotic legal proceedings in courtrooms across the country"". The ruling is a victory for the US government and others who had challenged the deal, arguing that releasing the Sacklers was a misuse of the system. But it raises major questions about the future of the agreement, which had won significant, if mixed, support from many who sued the company and saw it as the only practical way to reach the family's billions for drug treatment and other uses. Ellen Isaacs, whose son Patrick Ryan Wroblewski died of an overdose in 2018 at the age of 33, was one of the family members who had opposed the shield for the Sacklers. She said she was not sure what came next, but was hopeful that justice would be done. ""I'd like to see them held fully accountable,"" she said. ""I'm just so grateful to the Supreme Court right now I can't get beyond that.""

Reuters Oxycontin, often an entryway into harder drugs, such as heroin, has been blamed for driving the opioid crisis

Purdue became a household name in the US as the maker and promoter of OxyContin - a prescription painkiller it promoted as safe, despite being aware it was both highly addictive and widely abused. The company declared bankruptcy in 2019, after it was hit by thousands of lawsuits brought by states, cities and families. It later pleaded guilty to criminal charges, including defrauding health agencies and making illegal payments to doctors. The kind of shield granted to the Sacklers in this deal has been a critical feature of other high-profile settlements, including those involving Boy Scouts of America and the Catholic Church. But courts have been divided as to whether such ""releases"" from liability for third parties like the Sacklers are actually permitted. In asking the Supreme Court to take up the issue, lawyers for the US government said letting it stand ""would leave in place a roadmap for wealthy corporations and individuals to misuse the bankruptcy system"" and escape accountability. Writing for the 5-4 majority, Justice Neil Gorsuch echoed those concerns. ""The Sacklers have not agreed to place anything approaching their full assets on the table for opioid victims, "" he wrote. ""Yet they seek a judicial order that would extinguish virtually all claims against them for fraud, willful injury, and even wrongful death, all without the consent of those who have brought and seek to bring such claims."" The court noted that the Sacklers, who have long denied wrongdoing, ""seek to pay less than the code ordinarily requires and receive more than it normally permits"".

Oxycontin, often an entryway into harder drugs, such as heroin, has been blamed for driving the opioid crisis. Since 1999, a few years after the drug became available, deaths from opioid overdoses have surged eightfold to more than 80,000 annually. Court filings allege the Sackler family was long aware of the legal risks, and withdrew some $11bn from the company in the decade before its bankruptcy. They stashed much of the money overseas, while using some of it to pay company taxes, making recovery difficult. When the Supreme Court heard arguments last year, dozens of protesters opposing the deal showed up, holding signs such as ""my dead son does not release the Sacklers"". But many others had backed the deal, willing to accept the terms if the result was billions of dollars for treatment, as well as $750m that would go directly to opioid victims, estimated at $3,500-$48,000 each.

4 days ago By Tom Espiner , BBC business reporter Share

Alamy Thursday was the third day the inquiry heard from Gareth Jenkins. He will conclude his oral evidence on Friday

A Fujitsu software expert who helped build the Horizon system has said he felt pressurised by the Post Office over evidence he gave in the 2010 prosecution of sub-postmistress Seema Misra. Gareth Jenkins said the Post Office ""clearly"" wanted him to say that ""everything was perfect, and I don't think I actually said that"". However, in an email discussing the case at the time, he said Mrs Misra had ""jumped on the bandwagon"" in blaming Horizon for shortfalls in accounts. Mrs Misra told the BBC that this was an example of a culture that went ""right through the Post Office... [that] Horizon is perfect"".

Mrs Misra was one of hundreds of sub-postmasters and postmistresses prosecuted by the Post Office between 1999 and 2015 on the strength of faulty data from the Horizon accounting system. The technology made it look as though money was missing from Post Office branch accounts when it wasn't. At Mrs Misra's trial in 2010 she was accused of theft and false accounting. The sub-postmistress from West Byfleet, Surrey, was found guilty and sent to prison when she was eight weeks pregnant. Her conviction was quashed in 2021.

Mr Jenkins said he felt, prior to the prosecution, that he was being pressurised by the Post Office to make out that Horizon was ""perfect"" in commenting on a report written by an expert witness for the defence. He added that the management of Mrs Misra's case was ""fairly chaotic"", and that requests from the Post Office legal department had been unclear. Nevertheless, in an email discussing Mrs Misra's case in 2010, he wrote that Mrs Misra ""saw an article in [tech publication] Computer Weekly indicating that Horizon was unreliable and decided to jump on the bandwagon"". Mr Jenkins said this was ""totally inappropriate wording"" and apologised. Lead counsel for the inquiry Jason Beer asked Mr Jenkins whether he had been able to give evidence dispassionately, or had he been ""afflicted"" with the belief that sub-postmasters were jumping on the bandwagon in blaming Horizon for shortfalls. Mr Jenkins said that he didn't think Horizon was the problem, and that there were ""other reasons"" for shortfalls. Responding to Mr Jenkins' evidence, Mrs Misra said she felt that the former Fujitsu engineer's comments showed the culture in the Post Office at the time, which was that sub-postmasters were to blame for shortfalls, rather than Horizon being at fault.

Guidance sought

The inquiry was also shown an email sent on 27 January 2010 where Mr Jenkins had read a report on a separate prosecution and wrote that Horizon data “probably needs some further investigation”. However, he said the decision to do so would be “highly political”. ""We don't really want to be seen to be undermining a Post Office prosecution!"" he wrote. Mr Jenkins said he wanted guidance from senior management on ""what exactly we should be doing"". Mr Beer asked: ""Why did you need guidance on whether or not Fujitsu should just present the facts irrespective of whether they supported or undermined a Post Office prosecution?"" Mr Jenkins replied: ""The guidance I got was to just tell the truth, which is what I would have liked to have done anyway."" ""Did you need guidance from management on whether you should tell the truth or not?"" Mr Beer asked. Mr Jenkins said he would just tell the truth, but said he needed guidance from management on whether he was covered by management in this. Mr Beer asked: ""You needed top cover for telling the truth?"" Mr Jenkins responded: ""I don't know what to say to that."" Mr Jenkins is being investigated by the Metropolitan Police for suspected perjury - lying to court.

Delia-Ioana/BBC News Delia-Ioana said she can't imagine being able to afford a mortgage

The average cost of renting privately in England has risen by nearly a quarter since the last general election. In December 2019 rent cost £1,064 a month on average according to the Office for National Statistics (ONS). By May 2024 this had risen by 22% to £1,301 for new and existing tenancies. Renters have told the BBC they have settled for mouldy properties, sofa-surfed or moved back in with relatives. The National Residential Landlords Association blamed a “chronic shortage” of private rental homes on high interest rates prompting landlords to leave the market. Hundreds of people have been in touch with the BBC about rent via Your Voice, Your Vote.

'All of us have been homeless'

Delia-Ioana, a 24-year-old freelance production assistant, pays £567 per month for a flat share in Bristol. She said it took eight months for a dripping tap to be fixed, impacting her water bills, and the walls were mouldy and damp with mineral deposits. Delia-Ioana plans to move out soon, but said rent was often too expensive, and she worried about the future. “I was looking at my friends – all of us have been homeless at some point. A floor here, a sofa there,” she said. “How are we going to afford to have children if we can’t afford a house?” Average rents in Bristol rose 34% between December 2019 and May 2024, from £1,312 to £1,759 per month, the eighth largest increase among local authorities in England.

How has rent changed in your area?

Why has rent been increasing?

Between December 2019 and May 2024, average private rent in England rose by 22% according to the Office for National Statistics (ONS). It used a ""geometric average"" to account for differences in property types and changes in the rental markets. Across a similar period (April 2019 to April 2024) the Institute for Fiscal Studies estimated UK earnings rose by 4-6% in real terms. The Bank of England started raising interest rates in December 2021, pushing mortgages up. It has kept them at 5.25% since last summer, aiming to slow the pace of rising prices. Richard Donnell, property company Zoopla’s executive head of research, said these increases have made it harder for potential first-time buyers. According to Mr Donnell there are fewer private landlords, meaning the total number of rental homes in the UK has barely changed since 2016 - but demand has continued to soar. “The big increase in demand happened after the pandemic ended and the economy reopened,"" he said. ""You had this big return of people to cities, the international borders reopened.” He said the growth of working from home has made cheaper areas outside big cities more appealing.

Where has rent increased the most?

London has the highest average rent in England. But Tameside in Greater Manchester saw the largest percentage increase, up by more than 40% - from £555 in December 2019, to £780 in May 2024. Six Greater Manchester local authorities were among the areas with the biggest percentage rises in England.

'It was like a bidding war'

Luisa, a civil servant renting in Tameside, lived with her two adult children in a three-bedroom house for £695 per month in 2022. On 25 September that year, her landlord sent her a letter saying he was selling the property. He cited government decisions, interest rate increases, rising insurances and legislation he said unfairly tackled landlords. Two days earlier, then Prime Minister Liz Truss’s chancellor Kwasi Kwarteng shared a ‘mini budget’ intended to stimulate economic growth. This included £45bn of unfunded tax cuts - now mostly reversed. Following this, inflation and interest rates increased. A Liberal Democrat spokesperson blamed ""Liz Truss' botched budget"" for ""driving up rents for tenants"" and a Labour spokesperson said ""time and time again, the Tories have failed to stand up for renters"". A Conservative Party spokesman said “Covid and the war in Ukraine hiked up inflation and put pressure on renters, but we have got inflation down to normal levels”, adding they were committed to creating a fairer market for renters. Luisa spent four months looking for somewhere to live. “People were offering over the asking price or six months’ rent up front. I wasn’t in a position to do that,” she said. “It was like a bidding war – I’d turn up and there was a block viewing with about eight to 10 different people there.” Luisa rented the sixth house she viewed for £900 per month. She said: “I feel sorry for my children because my daughter’s 20 and at uni, my son is 26 – he has to help me out with rent. He’s unable to save up for his future.”

PA Media Surfers in Aberdeen stage a protest on the beach calling for an end to new oil and gas licensing

""Do you support new oil and gas licences, yes or no?"" That's the binary question which has been at the centre of the political debate in Scotland since parties began preparing to fight the general election. Political leaders have been hurling accusations that 100,000 jobs in Scotland will be at risk if no more licences are issued. But that figure is 40,000 more than the total number of people in Scotland whose roles currently rely directly or indirectly on fossil fuel extraction. And analysis by BBC Scotland News suggests that new licences will only extend the life of the North Sea by up to five years at today's production levels. The North Sea Transition Authority (NSTA) - which issues licences - estimates that about two billion barrels of ""unlicenced"" oil remains. Last year the industry produced 440 million barrels.

Environmentalists have been campaigning for governments to stop issuing exploration licences which allow oil companies to search for new discoveries of fossil fuels. The industry says without new oil finds, the rate at which the sector declines will accelerate - putting jobs at risk. It is now 25 years since production peaked in the North Sea. In 1999, the equivalent of about 1.7 billion barrels of oil and gas was pumped ashore. Output had dropped to 884 million barrels by 2010, then plummeted further to 552 million in 2022, a fall of about 67% on peak levels. Government predictions suggest output will halve again by 2030 to 251 million barrels and fall as low as 58 million by 2050 - which is just 3% of peak production. That's because when the oil boom came we targeted the biggest reserves first which were easiest to exploit.

Nowadays, operators are focused on the remaining smaller wells and using much more advanced - and expensive - techniques to extract it. While the North Sea Transition Authority estimates that the UK has around 10 to 15 billion barrels of oil and gas remaining, only about two billion are in areas where the UK government has so far not issued licences for operators to explore. The suggestion that 100,000 North Sea jobs could be at risk without new exploration licences came from Aberdeen and Grampian Chamber of Commerce. Using data from the investment banking firm Stifel, it produced a report last month saying the next Westminster government had ""just 100 days to save 100,000 jobs"" in the industry across the UK. During the general election campaign the Conservatives and SNP have repeatedly asserted that by promising to end exploration licences, their opponents risk 100,000 Scottish jobs.

Renewables industries like offshore wind are expected to ramp up this decade

The Conservatives fully support continued licences while the SNP say applications should be considered on a case-by-case basis. Labour has said it will issue no more licences and the Liberal Democrats believe the focus should be on creating more jobs in renewable energy like wind power. The Scottish Greens would go furthest of all, by rescinding recently issued licences including 54 which were granted in October and January. Offshore Energies UK estimates that there are now only 60,700 people in Scotland who work directly or indirectly in oil and gas. That number rises to 120,000 across the UK as a whole. Research by Robert Gordon University (RGU) estimates that in the worst case scenario the number of oil and gas jobs lost in the UK by 2030 could reach 60,000. It predicts that even on a best case scenario, with new licenses continuing and investment returning, some 33,000 jobs will still go as a result of falling oil and gas production. So by their estimate, the actual number of jobs ""at risk"" is 27,000 across the whole UK, not just Scotland.

Richard Cuevas claimed he witnessed substandard work on a crucial section of the Boeing 787

An aircraft mechanic who was contracted to repair Boeing planes has alleged he was labelled a ""snitch"" and then sacked for speaking up over safety concerns.

Richard Cuevas claimed he witnessed substandard manufacturing and maintenance work on a crucial section of Boeing 787 aircraft.

Boeing, which has been dogged by questions over whether its safety culture is rigorous enough, said the issues had been investigated and ""did not present a safety concern"".

Lawyers representing Mr Cuevas alleged he reported critical issues that could create a serious public safety risk and has filed complaints with the Federal Aviation Administration and the Occupational Health and Safety Administration.

Mr Cuevas, who has worked in the aviation industry for 40 years, was contracted to Spirit Aerosystems, to work on Boeing's 787 forward pressure bulkhead, a dome at the nose of the aircraft which serves as a barrier.

“He recognised the substandard work and expressed concern,"" Mr Cuevas' lawyers said. ""But Spirit and Boeing failed to stop the faulty manufacturing processes.""

According to the legal filings a colleague then remarked: “We’ve got a snitch among us.”

Mr Cuevas said he was sacked by Spirit Aerosystems in March 2024.

Boeing told the BBC: “A subcontractor’s employee previously reported concerns to us that we thoroughly investigated, as we take seriously any safety-related matter.""

However, the issues raised were found not to present a safety concern and had been addressed, Boeing said.

Spirit Aerosystems spokesperson Joe Buccino, said the firm was ""looking into the matter"".

""We encourage all Spirit employees with concerns to come forward, safe in knowing they will be protected,” he said.

Mr Cuevas' lawyers Debra Katz and Lisa Banks have previously represented another Boeing whistleblower, Sam Salehpour, who earlier this year told US Congress he had been harassed and threatened after he alleged there were quality problems at Boeing.

Mr Salehpour's concerns were also focused on production of the Boeing 787 model.

That is a different model to the 737 Max which was involved in mid-air cabin blow out in January.

That incident prompted heightened scrutiny of Boeing's safety standards.

In April, Boeing said that it had seen a sharp increase in employees speaking up after it gave assurances there would be no retaliation for doing so.

Boeing said that signalled progress towards ""a robust reporting culture"".

""We continue to put safety and quality above all else and share information transparently with our regulator, customers and other stakeholders,"" the company said.","Mechanic claims sacked for raising Boeing concernsRichard Cuevas claimed he witnessed substandard work on a crucial section of the Boeing 787An aircraft mechanic who was contracted to repair Boeing planes has alleged he was labelled a ""snitch"" and then sacked for speaking up over safety concerns.

Job aspirants speak to a hiring agent outside the Foxconn factory near Chennai

Neither Apple nor the Tamil Nadu state government responded to requests for comment from Reuters.

Foxconn said in a statement it ""vigorously refutes allegations of employment discrimination based on marital status"".

The federal labour ministry says the law ""clearly stipulates that no discrimination [is] to be made while recruiting men and women workers"".

A Reuters investigation alleged that Foxconn had excluded married women from jobs at its main India iPhone plant near Chennai, citing their greater family responsibilities compared to unmarried women.

The Indian government has sought a detailed report from Tamil Nadu state following media reports that Apple supplier Foxconn was allegedly rejecting married women for iPhone assembly jobs.

The BBC has also reached out to the Tamil Nadu labour department for a response.

Foxconn, the largest supplier of Apple iPhones, set up its first factory in Tamil Nadu in 2017 but has since been aggressively expanding its operations in India.

In 2023, it began assembling the iPhone 15 in the state and earlier this year, Foxconn tied up with Google to make Pixel smartphones in Tamil Nadu.

The company said it does not stand for discrimination in hiring or recruitment.

In a recent round of recruitment, 25% of women hired were married, according to the company.

It did acknowledge that 20 job ads posted by hiring agencies were removed in 2022 because they ""did not meet our standards"".

The discriminatory practices detailed in the Reuters investigation allegedly took place in 2023 and 2024.

""When we see an issue we act, including corrective action up to and including termination of the hiring agency,"" Foxconn added.

Rights activists say the reports about the firm's hiring practices in India are concerning, given that thousands look to its factories for employment opportunities.

Reuters said it spoke to numerous employees and Foxconn hiring agencies for the story.

The report said that hiring agents and Foxconn HR sources ""cited family duties, pregnancy and higher absenteeism as reasons why Foxconn did not hire married women at the plant"".

This is not the first time the firm has come under scrutiny for its labour practices.

In 2018, a US-based rights group had accused the firm of overworking and underpaying temporary workers at its factory in China that manufactured products for Amazon.

In 2022, its iPhone factory in China saw protests by workers who claimed that they had not been paid certain dues.","India reviews iPhone factory for 'not hiring married women'Job aspirants speak to a hiring agent outside the Foxconn factory near ChennaiNeither Apple nor the Tamil Nadu state government responded to requests for comment from Reuters.

Getty Images Amazon had to defend the use of AI technology in its physical grocery stores

Amazon received critical headlines this year when reports questioned the “Just Walk Out” technology installed at many of its physical grocery stores. The AI-powered system enables customers at many of its Amazon Fresh and Amazon Go shops to simply pick their items, and then leave. The AI uses lots of sensors to work out what you have chosen. You then get automatically billed. However, back in April it was widely reported that rather than solely using AI, Just Walk Out needed around 1,000 workers in India to manually check almost three quarters of the transactions.

Amazon was quick to claim that the reports were “erroneous”, and that staff in India were not reviewing video footage from all the shops. Instead it said that the Indian workers were simply reviewing the system. Amazon added that “this is no different than any other AI system that places a high value on accuracy, where human reviewers are common”. Whatever the exact details of the Amazon case, it is a high-profile example of a new and growing question – whether companies are making over-inflated claims about their use of AI. It is a phenomenon that has been dubbed “AI washing” in reference to the environmental ""green washing"".

But first, a reminder of what exactly AI means. While there is no exact definition, AI allows computers to learn and solve problems. AI is able to do this after first being trained on huge amounts of information. The specific type of AI that has made all the headlines over the past few years is so-called ""generative AI"". This is AI that specialises in creating new content, be it having text conversations, or producing music or images. Chatbots like ChatGPT, Google's Gemini, and Microsoft's Copilot are popular examples of generative AI. When it comes to AI washing, there are several types. Some companies claim to use AI when they're actually using less-sophisticated computing, while others overstate the efficacy of their AI over existing techniques, or suggest that their AI solutions are fully operational when they are not. Meanwhile, other firms are simply bolting an AI chatbot onto their existing non-AI operating software. While only 10% of tech start-ups mentioned using AI in their pitches in 2022, this rose to more than a quarter in 2023, according to OpenOcean, a UK and Finland-based investment fund for new tech firms. It expects that figure to be more than a third this year. And, says OpenOcean team member Sri Ayangar, competition for funding and the desire to appear on the cutting edge have pushed some such companies to overstate their AI capabilities. ""Some founders seem to believe that if they don’t mention AI in their pitch, this may put them at a disadvantage, regardless of the role it plays in their solution,"" says Mr Ayangar. ""And from our analysis, a significant disparity exists between companies claiming AI capabilities, and those demonstrating tangible AI-driven results.""

Sri Ayangar Sri Ayangar says that some start-up bosses feel they just have to mention AI

It is a problem that has quietly existed for a number of years, according to data from another tech investment firm, MMC Ventures. In a 2019 study it found that 40% of new tech firms that described themselves as ""AI start-ups"" in fact used virtually no AI at all. ""The problem is the same today, plus a different problem,"" says Simon Menashy, general partner at MMC Ventures. He explains that ""cutting-edge AI capabilities"" are now available for every company to buy for the price of standard software. But that instead of building a whole AI system, he says many firms are simply popping a chatbot interface on top of a non-AI product.

Douglas Dick, UK head of emerging technology risk at accountancy giant KPMG, says the problem of AI washing is not helped by the fact there not a single agreed definition of AI. ""If I asked a room of people what their definition of AI is, they would all give a different answer,” he says. “The term is used very broadly and loosely, without any clear point of reference. It is this ambiguity that is allowing AI washing to emerge. ""AI washing can have concerning impacts for businesses, from overpaying for technology and services to failing to meet operational objectives the AI was expected to help them achieve."" Meanwhile, for investors it can make it harder to identify genuinely innovative companies. And, says Mr Ayangar: ""If consumers have unmet expectations from products that claim to offer advanced AI-driven solutions, this can erode trust in start-ups that are doing genuinely ground-breaking work.""

Regulators, in the US at least, are starting to take notice. Earlier this year, the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) said it was charging two investment advisory firms with making false and misleading statements about the extent of their use of AI. ""The firm stance taken by the SEC demonstrates a lack of leeway when it comes to AI washing, indicating that, at least in the US, we can expect more fines and sanctions down the line for those who violate the regulations,"" says Nick White, partner at international law firm Charles Russell Speechlys.

Nick White Nick White says that it is good to see US regulators clamping down on the problem","What is 'AI washing' and why is it a problem?

Linköping University It might look basic - but could this be the future of screens?

At first glance, it looks like a relic from the 1980s. A tiny computer screen with flickering, low-resolution text scrolling across it. But this could be the future. The screen was made using perovskite light emitting diode (PeLED) technology. It is radically different to the LED technology used in your smartphone display today, and it could lead to devices that are thinner, cheaper and have longer battery life. Not only that, PeLEDs are very unusual in that they can absorb light as well as emit it, meaning you can use the same material to integrate touch, fingerprint and ambient light-sensing capabilities, says Feng Gao at Linköping University in Sweden. “This is difficult but we think it’s possible."" In today’s smartphones, such functions are carried out by electronic components separate to a phone’s screen itself. In a paper published in April, Prof Gao and colleagues demonstrated their prototype with touch and ambient light sensitivity already working. “It’s a very nice demonstration… it’s very new,” says Daniele Braga, head of sales and marketing for Fluxim, a technology research firm in Switzerland. Though he notes that optimising all the different functions promised here might make it difficult to commercialise this kind of display quickly. Via video call, Prof Gao shows off the latest version of the technology. It is another small screen, but this time the pixels per inch (ppi), a measurement of the sharpness of the display, has been nearly doubled – at 90 ppi. On the screen, a simple animation plays, showing two stick figures fighting. A paper with further details about this prototype has just been published.

Perovskite the mineral contains calcium, titanium and oxygen arranged in a crystal structure. It was discovered in the 1800s, but people later realised that they could make other kinds of perovskites that shared the same structure while having different elements or molecules as the components. Depending on the materials chosen, perovskites can be really good at, for example, conducting electricity or emitting light. “By slightly tuning the chemical composition you can cover the full visible spectrum,” says Dr Braga, explaining that making perovskites is a relatively simple and cheap process. “If you think about mass production, this is gigantic.” There are some problems, though. PeLEDs are notoriously unstable – they go bad with exposure to moisture or oxygen, for instance. Loreta Muscarella at VU Amsterdam, a university, is working to develop new kinds of PeLEDs. She says that if you leave a PeLED lying around for a few hours or days, the colour of light it emits will gradually degrade or shift to a less pure version of, say, green, than the green you want. And this undermines the whole point of perovskites. They are desirable in part because they can be tuned to emit a very specific, very pure form of red, green or blue – the key hues required for full colour digital displays.

To keep them stable, PeLEDs can be encapsulated in glue or resin, says Prof Gao. But researchers are still working on ensuring that the technology does not falter over a long period. Dr Muscarella says that traditional LEDs have lifetimes of 50,000 hours or more whereas PeLED lifespans are still in the hundreds to thousands of hours range. It could be years before you buy a commercial product that contains a PeLED, she adds. But there’s a different type of light-emitting perovskite that you might see on the market first. It relies on photoluminescence. This isn’t an LED as such but rather a filter or film-like material that absorbs and re-emits light in a particular colour. In some TV’s on the market today, a coloured filter supplies the crucial red, green and blue colours used in every pixel on the screen. It’s by mixing those colours at different levels that you can get the range of hues required to display a full picture. The red, green and blue filters are lit up by an LED backlight. But today’s filters actually block a lot of that light. Photoluminescent perovskites, in contrast, let almost all the light through, which would mean a big increase in brightness and efficiency. Helio, a British company, is working on this. A video on their website shows how a red or green coloured perovskite film can re-emit blue light as either red or green almost perfectly.

The technology Prof Gao and his colleagues are developing is quite different. They are experimenting with screens that emit light using LEDs which are themselves made with perovskites. These are known as electroluminescent perovskites. Working with them is tricky because they are sensitive to electrical fields and, as mentioned, aren’t very stable. But eventually they could be even more efficient options for lighting up the red, green and blue pixels in a smartphone, tablet or TV screen without any need for colour filters at all. The main advantages of switching to this technology could be in lowering the cost of these devices and in reducing their energy consumption. No-one is quite sure how much less energy a future PeLED display might consume versus, say, an OLED screen, but lab experiments suggest that PeLEDs are already competitive with OLEDs and could one day significantly exceed them in terms of efficiency, says Dr Muscarella.","The screen tech that can do almost anything6 days ago By Chris Baraniuk , Technology Reporter ShareLinköping University It might look basic - but could this be the future of screens?
The screen was made using perovskite light emitting diode (PeLED) technology.
In today’s smartphones, such functions are carried out by electronic components separate to a phone’s screen itself.
In some TV’s on the market today, a coloured filter supplies the crucial red, green and blue colours used in every pixel on the screen.
But eventually they could be even more efficient options for lighting up the red, green and blue pixels in a smartphone, tablet or TV screen without any need for colour filters at all.","['technology', 'light', 'red', 'peleds', 'tech', 'blue', 'screen', 'perovskites', 'green', 'working', 'different']",https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/5f71/live/d7d07e10-2d55-11ef-90be-b75b34b0bbb2.jpg,False,screen tech almost anyth day ago chris baraniuk technolog report share linkop univers might look basic could futur screen first glanc look like relic s tini comput screen flicker lowresolut text scroll across it could futur screen made use perovskit light emit diod pele technolog radic differ led technolog use smartphon display today could lead devic thinner cheaper longer batteri life that pele unusu absorb light well emit it mean use materi integr touch fingerprint ambient lightsens capabl say feng gao linkop univers sweden `` this difficult think it 's possibl today 's smartphon function carri electron compon separ phone 's screen itself paper publish april prof gao colleagu demonstr prototyp touch ambient light sensit alreadi work `` it 's nice demonstr ... it 's new '' say daniel braga head sale market fluxim technolog research firm switzerland though note optimis differ function promis might make difficult commercialis kind display quick via video call prof gao show latest version technolog anoth small screen time pixel per inch ppi measur sharp display near doubl - ppi screen simpl anim play show two stick figur fight paper detail prototyp publish allow twitter content twitter 's cooki polici privaci polici accept continu ' articl contain content provid twitter ask permiss anyth load may use cooki technolog may want readandbefor accept view content choos accept continu perovskit miner contain calcium titanium oxygen arrang crystal structur discov s peopl later realis could make kind perovskit share structur differ element molecul compon depend materi chosen perovskit realli good at exampl conduct electr emit light `` by slight tune chemic composit cover full visibl spectrum '' say dr braga explain make perovskit relat simpl cheap process `` if think mass product gigant '' problem though pele notori unstabl - go bad exposur moistur oxygen instanc loreta muscarella vu amsterdam univers work develop new kind pele say leav pele lie around hour day colour light emit gradual degrad shift less pure version of say green green want undermin whole point perovskit desir part tune emit specif pure form red green blue - key hue requir full colour digit display keep stabl pele encapsul glue resin say prof gao research still work ensur technolog falter long period dr muscarella say tradit led lifetim hour wherea pele lifespan still hundr thousand hour rang could year buy commerci product contain pele add there 's differ type lightemit perovskit might see market first reli photoluminesc is n't led rather filter filmlik materi absorb reemit light particular colour tv 's market today colour filter suppli crucial red green blue colour use everi pixel screen it 's mix colour differ level get rang hue requir display full pictur red green blue filter lit led backlight today 's filter actual block lot light photoluminesc perovskit contrast let almost light through would mean big increas bright effici helio british compani work this video websit show red green colour perovskit film reemit blue light either red green almost perfect helio helio film reemit blue light either red green littl light loss technolog prof gao colleagu develop quit differ experi screen emit light use led made perovskit known electroluminesc perovskit work tricki sensit electr field and mention are n't stabl eventu could even effici option light red green blue pixel smartphon tablet tv screen without need colour filter all main advantag switch technolog could lower cost devic reduc energi consumpt noon quit sure much less energi futur pele display might consum versus say ole screen lab experi suggest pele alreadi competit ole could one day signific exceed term effici say dr muscarella
