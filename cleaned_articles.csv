CNN —

Remember when Kate Moss wore wellies (that’s rain boots for those outside the UK) to Glastonbury?

As the historic festival once again returns to Worthy Farm, we look back at one of its most memorable fashion moments. After all, no British summer would be complete without copious amounts of mud.

And no one has conquered it quite like Moss.

Some 19 years ago, Britain’s best-known supermodel broke fashion’s proverbial fourth wall and joined the mortals in their muddy squalor. Sure, she’d probably spent the weekend glamping in the festival’s VIP zone. But a filthy field is England’s great leveler – and during those brief, well-photographed walks through the Glastonbury grounds, cigarette in hand, she was just like us.

Until, that is, her choice of practical footwear transformed festival fashion and helped save a heritage boot maker from the brink of obsolescence.

It was the summer of 2005 and Moss was near the height of her powers. Media interest in her festival whereabouts was amplified by a fixation with her then-nascent dalliance with Pete Doherty. But while The Libertines’ frontman certainly looked more at home in the conditions, it was Moss who grabbed the limelight.

Matching a pair of classic black Hunter rain boots with a waistcoat, short shorts and studded belt (and later a glittering tunic), the model was a picture of understated glamor. Below the knee her look was interchangeable with that of a Somerset pig farmer. But above it, she could just have easily emerged from a Chelsea mansion to a well-placed paparazzi ambush.

The images quickly went viral (or as viral as they could in the pre-social media age). The bastion of mid-1990s so-called “heroin chic” had become the face of its slightly older, more respectable cousin: mid-2000s festival chic.

In the process, wellies secured their place in the popular imagination. No longer the preserve of agriculture, they had become a rubbery status symbol best matched with trilby hats, cravats and other questionable noughties accessories. This once-practical boot had morphed into bourgeois badge of honor indicating that the wearer was prepared to “rough it” and still look fabulous (the drug-afflicted rockstar boyfriend remained an optional part of the look).

Suddenly, festival wear became its own category of clothing, something far greater than an amalgam of items you didn’t mind ruining. But an even more profound transformation was also taking place – that of the then-struggling Hunter Boot Limited.

The Scottish brand’s true heyday may have been during the World Wars, when it produced huge quantities of waterproof boots for the front lines. But never before in the company’s then 149-year history had its sensible footwear been so desirable. While one shouldn’t overstate the power of the Moss effect (her endorsement couldn’t save the boot maker from entering administration in 2006), it helped set in motion a remarkable turnaround in the company’s fortunes.

By 2007, the firm was under new ownership and reporting an 85% increase in year-on-year sales. It has since become a bona fide festival fixture, producing rainwear, outerwear and boots in all manner of colors and styles.

Once prized for keeping gangrene at bay in the trenches, Hunter has completed the ultimate 21st-century transformation to become the rainy-day boot de jour for celebrities from Rita Ora to Rihanna, Cara Delevingne to Alexa Chung.

And to think that all Kate wanted was a pair of snug, dry feet.","CNN —Remember when Kate Moss wore wellies (that’s rain boots for those outside the UK) to Glastonbury?

CNN —

The teenage cousin of the gunman responsible for the 2022 Uvalde, Texas, school shooting was arrested Monday on suspicion of threatening to “do the same thing” to a school, according to court documents obtained by CNN.

Nathan James Cruz, 17, was arrested on a felony charge of making a terroristic threat to a public place and a misdemeanor charge of making a terroristic threat against a family member, according to Bexar County Central Magistrate records.

Nathan James Cruz Bexar County Sheriff's Office

Cruz is the cousin of Salvador Ramos, the 18-year-old who fatally shot 19 children and two teachers at Robb Elementary School in May 2022, San Antonio police Sgt. Washington Moscoso told the New York Times on Monday.

CNN has sought comment from San Antonio police.

Ramos stormed into Robb Elementary last year armed with an assault rifle and tactical vest and opened fire on two adjoining classrooms – perpetrating one of the deadliest school shootings in modern US history. Law enforcement’s response has been heavily scrutinized, as officers waited outside the classrooms for more than an hour before entering and fatally shooting Ramos.

Cruz’s mother contacted police on Monday after her daughter reported that Cruz said he planned to “do the same thing” as his cousin, according to an affidavit obtained by CNN.

His mother told investigators she was “especially concerned because the suspect is currently on probation, was intoxicated at the time” and because the family lives across the street from an elementary school, the affidavit states.

Cruz’s sister told investigators that while she was giving her brother a ride, he “threatened to shoot her in the head and stated he would ‘shoot the school,’” according to the affidavit.

The mother allegedly overheard a phone conversation in which Cruz was attempting to illegally acquire an AR-15-style assault rifle – the same style used by Ramos to carry out the Uvalde shooting, according to the affidavit.

Following his arrest, Cruz “denied making any threats” when interviewed by a detective, the document states.

CNN has been unable to confirm whether Cruz has an attorney. His charges carry a combined $160,000 bond, according to the magistrate records.","Editor’s Note: (6/27/24) Since this story was published in August 2023, the case against Nathan James Cruz was dismissed due to a missing witness, according to court records in Bexar County, Texas.

She has been locked out of her Yotta banking account since May 11. Courtesy: Natasha Craft

When Natasha Craft first got a Yotta banking account in 2021, she loved using it so much she told her friends to sign up. The app made saving money fun and easy, and Craft, a now 25-year-old FedEx driver from Mishawaka, Indiana, was busy getting her financial life in order and planning a wedding. Craft had her wages deposited directly into a Yotta account and used the startup's debit card to pay for all her expenses. The app — which gamifies personal finance with weekly sweepstakes and other flashy features — even occasionally covered some of her transactions. ""There were times I would go buy something and get that purchase for free,"" Craft told CNBC. Today, her entire life savings — $7,006 — is locked up in a complicated dispute playing out in bankruptcy court, online forums like Reddit and regulatory channels. And Yotta, an array of other startups and their banks have been caught in a moment of reckoning for the fintech industry. For customers, fintech promised the best of both worlds: The innovation, ease of use and fun of the newest apps combined with the safety of government-backed accounts held at real banks. The startups prominently displayed protections afforded by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp., lending credibility to their novel offerings. After all, since its 1934 inception, no depositor ""has ever lost a penny of FDIC-insured deposits,"" according to the agency's website. But the widening fallout over the collapse of a fintech middleman called Synapse has revealed that promise of safety as a mirage. Starting May 11, more than 100,000 Americans with $265 million in deposits were locked out of their accounts. Roughly 85,000 of those customers were at Yotta alone, according to the startup's co-founder, Adam Moelis. CNBC reached out to fintech customers whose lives have been upended by the Synapse debacle. They come from all walks and stages of life, from Craft, the Indiana FedEx driver; to the owner of a chain of preschools in Oakland, California; a talent analyst for Disney living in New York City; and a computer engineer in Santa Barbara, California. A high school teacher in Maryland. A parent in Bristol, Connecticut, who opened an account for his daughter. A social worker in Seattle saving up for dental work after Adderall abuse ruined her teeth.

'A reckoning underway'

Since Yotta, like most popular fintech apps, wasn't itself a bank, it relied on partner institutions including Tennessee-based Evolve Bank & Trust to offer checking accounts and debit cards. In between Yotta and Evolve was a crucial middleman, Synapse, keeping track of balances and monitoring fraud. Founded in 2014 by a first-time entrepreneur named Sankaet Pathak, Synapse was a player in the ""banking-as-a-service"" segment alongside companies like Unit and Synctera. Synapse helped customer-facing startups like Yotta quickly access the rails of the regulated banking industry. It had contracts with 100 fintech companies and 10 million end users, according to an April court filing. Until recently, the BaaS model was a growth engine that seemed to benefit everybody. Instead of spending years and millions of dollars trying to acquire or become banks, startups got quick access to essential services they needed to offer. The small banks that catered to them got a source of deposits in a time dominated by giants like JPMorgan Chase . But in May, Synapse, in the throes of bankruptcy, turned off a critical system that Yotta's bank used to process transactions. In doing so, it threw thousands of Americans into financial limbo, and a growing segment of the fintech industry into turmoil. ""There is a reckoning underway that involves questions about the banking-as-a-service model,"" said Michele Alt, a former lawyer for the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency and a current partner at consulting firm Klaros Group. She believes the Synapse failure will prove to be an ""aberration,"" she added. The most popular finance apps in the country, including Block's Cash App, PayPal and Chime, partner with banks instead of owning them. They account for 60% of all new fintech account openings, according to data provider Curinos. Block and PayPal are publicly traded; Chime is expected to launch an IPO next year. Block, PayPal and Chime didn't provide comment for this article.

'Deal directly with a bank'

While industry experts say those firms have far more robust ledgering and daily reconciliation abilities than Synapse, they may still be riskier than direct bank relationships, especially for those relying on them as a primary account. ""If it's your spending money, you need to be dealing directly with a bank,"" Scott Sanborn, CEO of LendingClub , told CNBC. ""Otherwise, how do you, as a consumer, know if the conditions are met to get FDIC coverage?"" Sanborn knows both sides of the fintech divide: LendingClub started as a fintech lender that partnered with banks until it bought Boston-based Radius in early 2020 for $185 million, eventually becoming a fully regulated bank.

Sanborn said acquiring Radius Bank opened his eyes to the risks of the ""banking-as-a-service"" space. Regulators focus not on Synapse and other middlemen, but on the banks they partner with, expecting them to monitor risks and prevent fraud and money laundering, he said. But many of the tiny banks running BaaS businesses like Radius simply don't have the personnel or resources to do the job properly, Sanborn said. He shuttered most of the lender's fintech business as soon as he could, he says. ""We are one of those people who said, 'Something bad is going to happen,'"" Sanborn said. A spokeswoman for the Financial Technology Association, a Washington, D.C.-based trade group representing large players including Block, PayPal and Chime, said in a statement that it is ""inaccurate to claim that banks are the only trusted actors in financial services."" ""Consumers and small businesses trust fintech companies to better meet their needs and provide more accessible, affordable, and secure services than incumbent providers,"" the spokeswoman said. ""Established fintech companies are well-regulated and work with partner banks to build strong compliance programs that protect consumer funds,"" she said. Furthermore, regulators ought to take a ""risk-based approach"" to supervising fintech-bank partnerships, she added. The implications of the Synapse disaster may be far-reaching. Regulators have already been moving to punish the banks that provide services to fintechs, and that will undoubtedly continue. Evolve itself was reprimanded by the Federal Reserve last month for failing to properly manage its fintech partnerships.

In a post-Synapse update, the FDIC made it clear that the failure of nonbanks won't trigger FDIC insurance, and that even when fintechs partner with banks, customers may not have their deposits covered. The FDIC's exact language about whether fintech customers are eligible for coverage: ""The short answer is: it depends.""

FDIC safety net

While their circumstances all differed vastly, each of the customers CNBC spoke to for this story had one thing in common: They thought the FDIC backing of Evolve meant that their funds were safe. ""For us, it just felt like they were a bank,"" the Oakland preschool owner said of her fintech provider, a tuition processor called Curacubby. ""You'd tell them what to bill, they bill it. They'd communicate with parents, and we get the money."" The 62-year-old business owner, who asked CNBC to withhold her name because she didn't want to alarm employees and parents of her schools, said she's taken out loans and tapped credit lines after $236,287 in tuition was frozen in May. Now, the prospect of selling her business and retiring in a few years seems much further out. ""I'm assuming I probably won't see that money,"" she said, ""And if I do, how long is it going to take?"" When Rick Davies, a 46-year-old lead engineer for a men's clothing company that owns online brands including Taylor Stitch, signed up for an account with crypto app Juno, he says he ""distinctly remembers"" being comforted by seeing the FDIC logo of Evolve. ""It was front and center on their website,"" Davies said. ""They made it clear that it was Evolve doing the banking, which I knew as a fintech provider. The whole package seemed legit to me."" He's now had roughly $10,000 frozen for weeks, and says he's become enraged that the FDIC hasn't helped customers yet. For Davies, the situation is even more baffling after regulators swiftly took action to seize Silicon Valley Bank last year, protecting uninsured depositors including tech investors and wealthy families in the process. His employer banked with SVB, which collapsed after clients withdrew deposits en masse, so he saw how fast action by regulators can head off distress. ""The dichotomy between the FDIC stepping in extremely quickly for San Francisco-based tech companies and their impotence in the face of this similar, more consumer-oriented situation is infuriating,"" Davies said. The key difference with SVB is that none of the banks linked with Synapse have failed, and because of that, the regulator hasn't moved to help impacted users. Consumers can be forgiven for not understanding the nuance of FDIC protection, said Alt, the former OCC lawyer. ""What consumers understood was, 'This is as safe as money in the bank,'"" Alt said. ""But the FDIC insurance isn't a pot of money to generally make people whole, it is there to make depositors of a failed bank whole.""

While industry experts say those firms have far more robust ledgering and daily reconciliation abilities than Synapse, they may still be riskier than direct bank relationships, especially for those relying on them as a primary account. ""If it's your spending money, you need to be dealing directly with a bank,"" Scott Sanborn, CEO of LendingClub , told CNBC. ""Otherwise, how do you, as a consumer, know if the conditions are met to get FDIC coverage?"" Sanborn knows both sides of the fintech divide: LendingClub started as a fintech lender that partnered with banks until it bought Boston-based Radius in early 2020 for $185 million, eventually becoming a fully regulated bank.

Sanborn said acquiring Radius Bank opened his eyes to the risks of the ""banking-as-a-service"" space. Regulators focus not on Synapse and other middlemen, but on the banks they partner with, expecting them to monitor risks and prevent fraud and money laundering, he said. But many of the tiny banks running BaaS businesses like Radius simply don't have the personnel or resources to do the job properly, Sanborn said. He shuttered most of the lender's fintech business as soon as he could, he says. ""We are one of those people who said, 'Something bad is going to happen,'"" Sanborn said. A spokeswoman for the Financial Technology Association, a Washington, D.C.-based trade group representing large players including Block, PayPal and Chime, said in a statement that it is ""inaccurate to claim that banks are the only trusted actors in financial services."" ""Consumers and small businesses trust fintech companies to better meet their needs and provide more accessible, affordable, and secure services than incumbent providers,"" the spokeswoman said. ""Established fintech companies are well-regulated and work with partner banks to build strong compliance programs that protect consumer funds,"" she said. Furthermore, regulators ought to take a ""risk-based approach"" to supervising fintech-bank partnerships, she added. The implications of the Synapse disaster may be far-reaching. Regulators have already been moving to punish the banks that provide services to fintechs, and that will undoubtedly continue. Evolve itself was reprimanded by the Federal Reserve last month for failing to properly manage its fintech partnerships.

In a post-Synapse update, the FDIC made it clear that the failure of nonbanks won't trigger FDIC insurance, and that even when fintechs partner with banks, customers may not have their deposits covered. The FDIC's exact language about whether fintech customers are eligible for coverage: ""The short answer is: it depends.""

FDIC safety net

While their circumstances all differed vastly, each of the customers CNBC spoke to for this story had one thing in common: They thought the FDIC backing of Evolve meant that their funds were safe. ""For us, it just felt like they were a bank,"" the Oakland preschool owner said of her fintech provider, a tuition processor called Curacubby. ""You'd tell them what to bill, they bill it. They'd communicate with parents, and we get the money."" The 62-year-old business owner, who asked CNBC to withhold her name because she didn't want to alarm employees and parents of her schools, said she's taken out loans and tapped credit lines after $236,287 in tuition was frozen in May. Now, the prospect of selling her business and retiring in a few years seems much further out. ""I'm assuming I probably won't see that money,"" she said, ""And if I do, how long is it going to take?"" When Rick Davies, a 46-year-old lead engineer for a men's clothing company that owns online brands including Taylor Stitch, signed up for an account with crypto app Juno, he says he ""distinctly remembers"" being comforted by seeing the FDIC logo of Evolve. ""It was front and center on their website,"" Davies said. ""They made it clear that it was Evolve doing the banking, which I knew as a fintech provider. The whole package seemed legit to me."" He's now had roughly $10,000 frozen for weeks, and says he's become enraged that the FDIC hasn't helped customers yet. For Davies, the situation is even more baffling after regulators swiftly took action to seize Silicon Valley Bank last year, protecting uninsured depositors including tech investors and wealthy families in the process. His employer banked with SVB, which collapsed after clients withdrew deposits en masse, so he saw how fast action by regulators can head off distress. ""The dichotomy between the FDIC stepping in extremely quickly for San Francisco-based tech companies and their impotence in the face of this similar, more consumer-oriented situation is infuriating,"" Davies said. The key difference with SVB is that none of the banks linked with Synapse have failed, and because of that, the regulator hasn't moved to help impacted users. Consumers can be forgiven for not understanding the nuance of FDIC protection, said Alt, the former OCC lawyer. ""What consumers understood was, 'This is as safe as money in the bank,'"" Alt said. ""But the FDIC insurance isn't a pot of money to generally make people whole, it is there to make depositors of a failed bank whole.""

She has been locked out of her Yotta banking account since May 11. Courtesy: Natasha Craft

When Natasha Craft first got a Yotta banking account in 2021, she loved using it so much she told her friends to sign up. The app made saving money fun and easy, and Craft, a now 25-year-old FedEx driver from Mishawaka, Indiana, was busy getting her financial life in order and planning a wedding. Craft had her wages deposited directly into a Yotta account and used the startup's debit card to pay for all her expenses. The app — which gamifies personal finance with weekly sweepstakes and other flashy features — even occasionally covered some of her transactions. ""There were times I would go buy something and get that purchase for free,"" Craft told CNBC. Today, her entire life savings — $7,006 — is locked up in a complicated dispute playing out in bankruptcy court, online forums like Reddit and regulatory channels. And Yotta, an array of other startups and their banks have been caught in a moment of reckoning for the fintech industry. For customers, fintech promised the best of both worlds: The innovation, ease of use and fun of the newest apps combined with the safety of government-backed accounts held at real banks. The startups prominently displayed protections afforded by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp., lending credibility to their novel offerings. After all, since its 1934 inception, no depositor ""has ever lost a penny of FDIC-insured deposits,"" according to the agency's website. But the widening fallout over the collapse of a fintech middleman called Synapse has revealed that promise of safety as a mirage. Starting May 11, more than 100,000 Americans with $265 million in deposits were locked out of their accounts. Roughly 85,000 of those customers were at Yotta alone, according to the startup's co-founder, Adam Moelis. CNBC reached out to fintech customers whose lives have been upended by the Synapse debacle. They come from all walks and stages of life, from Craft, the Indiana FedEx driver; to the owner of a chain of preschools in Oakland, California; a talent analyst for Disney living in New York City; and a computer engineer in Santa Barbara, California. A high school teacher in Maryland. A parent in Bristol, Connecticut, who opened an account for his daughter. A social worker in Seattle saving up for dental work after Adderall abuse ruined her teeth.

'A reckoning underway'

Since Yotta, like most popular fintech apps, wasn't itself a bank, it relied on partner institutions including Tennessee-based Evolve Bank & Trust to offer checking accounts and debit cards. In between Yotta and Evolve was a crucial middleman, Synapse, keeping track of balances and monitoring fraud. Founded in 2014 by a first-time entrepreneur named Sankaet Pathak, Synapse was a player in the ""banking-as-a-service"" segment alongside companies like Unit and Synctera. Synapse helped customer-facing startups like Yotta quickly access the rails of the regulated banking industry. It had contracts with 100 fintech companies and 10 million end users, according to an April court filing. Until recently, the BaaS model was a growth engine that seemed to benefit everybody. Instead of spending years and millions of dollars trying to acquire or become banks, startups got quick access to essential services they needed to offer. The small banks that catered to them got a source of deposits in a time dominated by giants like JPMorgan Chase . But in May, Synapse, in the throes of bankruptcy, turned off a critical system that Yotta's bank used to process transactions. In doing so, it threw thousands of Americans into financial limbo, and a growing segment of the fintech industry into turmoil. ""There is a reckoning underway that involves questions about the banking-as-a-service model,"" said Michele Alt, a former lawyer for the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency and a current partner at consulting firm Klaros Group. She believes the Synapse failure will prove to be an ""aberration,"" she added. The most popular finance apps in the country, including Block's Cash App, PayPal and Chime, partner with banks instead of owning them. They account for 60% of all new fintech account openings, according to data provider Curinos. Block and PayPal are publicly traded; Chime is expected to launch an IPO next year. Block, PayPal and Chime didn't provide comment for this article.

""Established fintech companies are well-regulated and work with partner banks to build strong compliance programs that protect consumer funds,"" she said. Furthermore, regulators ought to take a ""risk-based approach"" to supervising fintech-bank partnerships, she added. The implications of the Synapse disaster may be far-reaching. Regulators have already been moving to punish the banks that provide services to fintechs, and that will undoubtedly continue. Evolve itself was reprimanded by the Federal Reserve last month for failing to properly manage its fintech partnerships.

In a post-Synapse update, the FDIC made it clear that the failure of nonbanks won't trigger FDIC insurance, and that even when fintechs partner with banks, customers may not have their deposits covered. The FDIC's exact language about whether fintech customers are eligible for coverage: ""The short answer is: it depends.""

FDIC safety net

While their circumstances all differed vastly, each of the customers CNBC spoke to for this story had one thing in common: They thought the FDIC backing of Evolve meant that their funds were safe. ""For us, it just felt like they were a bank,"" the Oakland preschool owner said of her fintech provider, a tuition processor called Curacubby. ""You'd tell them what to bill, they bill it. They'd communicate with parents, and we get the money."" The 62-year-old business owner, who asked CNBC to withhold her name because she didn't want to alarm employees and parents of her schools, said she's taken out loans and tapped credit lines after $236,287 in tuition was frozen in May. Now, the prospect of selling her business and retiring in a few years seems much further out. ""I'm assuming I probably won't see that money,"" she said, ""And if I do, how long is it going to take?"" When Rick Davies, a 46-year-old lead engineer for a men's clothing company that owns online brands including Taylor Stitch, signed up for an account with crypto app Juno, he says he ""distinctly remembers"" being comforted by seeing the FDIC logo of Evolve. ""It was front and center on their website,"" Davies said. ""They made it clear that it was Evolve doing the banking, which I knew as a fintech provider. The whole package seemed legit to me."" He's now had roughly $10,000 frozen for weeks, and says he's become enraged that the FDIC hasn't helped customers yet. For Davies, the situation is even more baffling after regulators swiftly took action to seize Silicon Valley Bank last year, protecting uninsured depositors including tech investors and wealthy families in the process. His employer banked with SVB, which collapsed after clients withdrew deposits en masse, so he saw how fast action by regulators can head off distress. ""The dichotomy between the FDIC stepping in extremely quickly for San Francisco-based tech companies and their impotence in the face of this similar, more consumer-oriented situation is infuriating,"" Davies said. The key difference with SVB is that none of the banks linked with Synapse have failed, and because of that, the regulator hasn't moved to help impacted users. Consumers can be forgiven for not understanding the nuance of FDIC protection, said Alt, the former OCC lawyer. ""What consumers understood was, 'This is as safe as money in the bank,'"" Alt said. ""But the FDIC insurance isn't a pot of money to generally make people whole, it is there to make depositors of a failed bank whole.""

CNBC reached out to fintech customers whose lives have been upended by the Synapse debacle.
Instead of spending years and millions of dollars trying to acquire or become banks, startups got quick access to essential services they needed to offer.
They account for 60% of all new fintech account openings, according to data provider Curinos.

CNBC,https://www.cnbc.com/2024/07/02/powell-says-fed-has-made-quite-a-bit-of-progress-on-inflation-but-needs-more-confidence-before-cutting.html,2024-07-02,15:59:34 UTC,Powell says Fed has made 'quite a bit of progress' on inflation but needs more confidence before cutting,"U.S. Federal Reserve Bank Chair Jerome Powell announces that interest rates will remain unchanged during a news conference at the Federal Reserves’ William McChesney Martin building on June 12, 2024 in Washington, DC.

Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell expressed satisfaction Tuesday with the progress on inflation over the past year but said he wants to see more before being confident enough to start cutting interest rates.

""We've made quite a bit of progress and in bringing inflation back down to our target,"" Powell said at a central banking forum in Sintra, Portugal.

""The last [inflation] reading and the one before it to a lesser extent, suggest that we are getting back on the disinflationary path. We want to be more confident that inflation is moving sustainably down toward 2% before we start the process of reducing or loosening policy,"" he added.

Powell spoke at a forum that also included European Central Bank President Christine Lagarde and Brazil central bank Governor Roberto Campos Neto. The forum was presented by the ECB and the discussion was moderated by CNBC's Sara Eisen.

The comments come with markets closely watching moves from the Fed and its global counterparts as inflation shows signs of easing and some central banks, including the ECB, have slowly started rolling back interest rates.

The Commerce Department's personal consumption expenditures price index, which the Fed focuses on as its main inflation gauge, rose at a 2.6% 12-month pace in May. That level has come down steadily after being around 4% a year ago, though policymakers do not expect it to reach the Fed's 2% goal until 2026.

While Powell said he sees progress on inflation, he's wary of moving too soon and threatening the downward path of price increases, which hit their highest pace since the early 1980s two years ago.

""We're well aware that if we go too soon, that we can undo the good work we've done,"" he said. ""If we do it too late, we could unnecessarily undermine the recovery and the expansion.""

Risks of moving too late as opposed to too soon have come into better balance this year as inflation has ebbed and the economy and labor market have stayed strong, Powell added. By contrast, the Fed spent much of the past year worried that cutting rates too soon and allowing inflation to resume its upward trek posed the greater risk.

Earlier this year, markets had expected at least six Fed rate cuts of a quarter percentage point each. Market pricing has since adjusted to anticipate two reductions, one in September and another before the end of the year. However, members of the rate-setting Federal Open Market Committee at their June meeting penciled in just one.

Asked if he thought the Fed might cut in September, Powell responded, ""I'm not going to be landing on any specific dates here today.""

He also was asked about whether he was concerned about the political climate and specifically should Donald Trump, a fierce Powell critic, win the November presidential election.

""I am not focused on that at all, and that's not just a talking point. I really think that we just keep doing our jobs,"" he said.","Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell expressed satisfaction Tuesday with the progress on inflation over the past year but said he wants to see more before being confident enough to start cutting interest rates.

CNBC,https://www.cnbc.com/2024/07/02/doggett-first-house-democrat-urges-biden-to-withdraw-from-presidential-race.html,2024-07-02,17:38:27 UTC,First House Democrat urges Biden to withdraw from presidential race,"Rep. Lloyd Doggett, D-Texas, makes his way to House votes in the U.S. Capitol on Wednesday, June 5, 2024.

Rep. Lloyd Doggett of Texas urged President Joe Biden on Tuesday to ""make the painful and difficult decision to withdraw"" from the 2024 presidential race.

Doggett, 77, is the first sitting Democratic lawmaker to formally call on his own party's incumbent to drop his reelection bid against former President Donald Trump, the presumptive Republican nominee.

The call significantly escalates pressure on Biden, 81, whose disastrous debate against Trump last week set off waves of panic among his supporters about whether he is capable of winning in November and serving another four years in the White House.

But Biden and his team have so far shut down any suggestion that he will leave the race.

In response to Doggett's statement, a Biden campaign official told NBC News: ""He's staying in.""

Doggett explicitly tied his decision to Biden's debate performance.

""President Biden has continued to run substantially behind Democratic senators in key states and in most polls has trailed Donald Trump,"" Doggett said in a press release.

""I had hoped that the debate would provide some momentum to change that. It did not.""

""Instead of reassuring voters, the President failed to effectively defend his many accomplishments and expose Trump's many lies,"" the lawmaker said.

""Our overriding consideration must be who has the best hope of saving our democracy from an authoritarian takeover by a criminal and his gang,"" Doggett wrote in the statement. ""Too much is at stake to risk a Trump victory—too great a risk to assume that what could not be turned around in a year, what was not turned around in the debate, can be turned around now.""

""President Biden saved our democracy by delivering us from Trump in 2020. He must not deliver us to Trump in 2024,"" Doggett said.

The Texas Democrat also warned of the threat that a second Trump presidency would pose, pointing to the Supreme Court's decision this week to grant ""presumptive immunity"" to former presidents for all their official acts.

""Trump, newly-empowered with immunity, could usher America into a long, dark, authoritarian era unchecked by either the courts or a submissive Republican Congress,"" Doggett's statement said.

He encouraged Biden to follow the lead of former President Lyndon Johnson, who voluntarily declined to seek a second term in office.

""Under very different circumstances, [Johnson] made the painful decision to withdraw. President Biden should do the same,"" Doggett said.

""My decision to make these strong reservations public is not done lightly nor does it in any way diminish my respect for all that President Biden has achieved,"" he said.

""Recognizing that, unlike Trump, President Biden's first commitment has always been to our country, not himself, I am hopeful that he will make the painful and difficult decision to withdraw.""","Rep. Lloyd Doggett of Texas urged President Joe Biden on Tuesday to ""make the painful and difficult decision to withdraw"" from the 2024 presidential race.
""President Biden has continued to run substantially behind Democratic senators in key states and in most polls has trailed Donald Trump,"" Doggett said in a press release.

CNBC,https://www.cnbc.com/2024/07/02/doggett-first-house-democrat-urges-biden-to-withdraw-from-presidential-race.html,2024-07-02,17:38:27 UTC,First House Democrat urges Biden to withdraw from presidential race,"Rep. Lloyd Doggett, D-Texas, makes his way to House votes in the U.S. Capitol on Wednesday, June 5, 2024.

Rep. Lloyd Doggett of Texas urged President Joe Biden on Tuesday to ""make the painful and difficult decision to withdraw"" from the 2024 presidential race.

Doggett, 77, is the first sitting Democratic lawmaker to formally call on his own party's incumbent to drop his reelection bid against former President Donald Trump, the presumptive Republican nominee.

The call significantly escalates pressure on Biden, 81, whose disastrous debate against Trump last week set off waves of panic among his supporters about whether he is capable of winning in November and serving another four years in the White House.

But Biden and his team have so far shut down any suggestion that he will leave the race.

In response to Doggett's statement, a Biden campaign official told NBC News: ""He's staying in.""

Doggett explicitly tied his decision to Biden's debate performance.

""President Biden has continued to run substantially behind Democratic senators in key states and in most polls has trailed Donald Trump,"" Doggett said in a press release.

""I had hoped that the debate would provide some momentum to change that. It did not.""

""Instead of reassuring voters, the President failed to effectively defend his many accomplishments and expose Trump's many lies,"" the lawmaker said.

""Our overriding consideration must be who has the best hope of saving our democracy from an authoritarian takeover by a criminal and his gang,"" Doggett wrote in the statement. ""Too much is at stake to risk a Trump victory—too great a risk to assume that what could not be turned around in a year, what was not turned around in the debate, can be turned around now.""

""President Biden saved our democracy by delivering us from Trump in 2020. He must not deliver us to Trump in 2024,"" Doggett said.

The Texas Democrat also warned of the threat that a second Trump presidency would pose, pointing to the Supreme Court's decision this week to grant ""presumptive immunity"" to former presidents for all their official acts.

""Trump, newly-empowered with immunity, could usher America into a long, dark, authoritarian era unchecked by either the courts or a submissive Republican Congress,"" Doggett's statement said.

He encouraged Biden to follow the lead of former President Lyndon Johnson, who voluntarily declined to seek a second term in office.

""Under very different circumstances, [Johnson] made the painful decision to withdraw. President Biden should do the same,"" Doggett said.

""My decision to make these strong reservations public is not done lightly nor does it in any way diminish my respect for all that President Biden has achieved,"" he said.

""Recognizing that, unlike Trump, President Biden's first commitment has always been to our country, not himself, I am hopeful that he will make the painful and difficult decision to withdraw.""","Rep.

CNBC,https://www.cnbc.com/2024/07/02/donald-trump-hush-money-delay-sentencing.html,2024-07-02,16:33:41 UTC,Trump hush money prosecutors won't oppose sentencing delay while ex-president fights verdict,"Former U.S. President Donald Trump comments as he leaves the courthouse after a jury found him guilty of all 34 felony counts in his criminal trial at New York State Supreme Court on May 30, 2024.

Manhattan prosecutors said Tuesday they do not oppose a bid by former President Donald Trump to postpone being sentenced in his criminal hush money case while he seeks to overturn his conviction.

Attorneys for the presumptive Republican presidential nominee launched that bid on Monday, tying the move to the Supreme Court's bombshell ruling that former presidents are entitled to “presumptive immunity” for all official acts they performed in office.

The 6-3 decision instantly threatened to alter or undermine some of the numerous active criminal cases against Trump.

The hush money case, which will likely be the only one against Trump to head to trial before the Nov. 5 presidential election, ended on May 30 with Trump's conviction on 34 counts of falsifying business records.

The case centered on a $130,000 payment made shortly before the 2016 election to porn star Stormy Daniels, who says she had sex with Trump while he was married years earlier.

Trump is currently set to be sentenced on July 11.

But in their letter to Judge Juan Merchan on Monday, Trump's attorneys asked for a July 10 deadline to submit a legal memo in support of their bid to set aside the guilty verdict.

And “because of the complexity of the issues presented,” they added, “President Trump does not object to an adjournment of the July 11, 2024 sentencing date in order to allow adequate time for full briefing, oral argument, and a decision.”

The attorneys argued in the letter that, under the Supreme Court's latest ruling, certain evidence prosecutors introduced at trial “should never have been put before the jury.”

“The verdicts in this case violate the presidential immunity doctrine and create grave risks of ‘an Executive Branch that cannibalizes itself,’” they wrote, quoting the majority opinion from Chief Justice John Roberts.

“After further briefing on these issues beginning on July 10, 2024, it will be manifest that the trial result cannot stand,” Trump's lawyers wrote.

In a letter to Merchan on Tuesday morning, prosecutors from the Manhattan District Attorney's office said they believe Trump's arguments are meritless.

But “we do not oppose his request for leave to file and his putative request to adjourn sentencing pending determination of his motion,” the prosecutors wrote.

They asked for a deadline of July 24 to file their response to Trump's proposed memo.

If Merchan grants the requests, Trump's sentencing date will be delayed by at least several weeks.

The Supreme Court's ruling came as part of a separate criminal case charging Trump with illegally conspiring to overturn his loss to President Joe Biden in the 2020 election.

That case was put on ice for months while Trump and special counsel Jack Smith grappled over whether former presidents are immune from prosecution for their official acts.

Judges in federal district court and the federal appellate circuit in Washington, D.C., had rejected Trump's claim of “absolute immunity” for all official acts.

But the Supreme Court's six-member conservative majority vacated those decisions, ruling Monday that ex-presidents have “at least presumptive immunity from prosecution” for those acts.

That immunity holds “unless the Government can show that applying a criminal prohibition to that act would pose no ‘dangers of intrusion on the authority and functions of the Executive Branch,’” Roberts wrote.

The majority also appeared to limit the evidence that can be used in a criminal prosecution of a former president, even if they are only accused of unofficial conduct.

Using evidence of official conduct in such a prosecution would defeat the intended effect of the president's immunity, Roberts wrote. Doing so “would thereby heighten the prospect that the President's official decisionmaking will be distorted.”

The decision drew a vehement response from the court's three liberal justices, including Sonia Sotomayor, who expressed “fear for our democracy” in a scathing dissent.","Manhattan prosecutors said Tuesday they do not oppose a bid by former President Donald Trump to postpone being sentenced in his criminal hush money case while he seeks to overturn his conviction.

CNBC,https://www.cnbc.com/2024/07/02/googles-carbon-emissions-surge-nearly-50percent-due-to-ai-energy-demand.html,2024-07-02,20:13:55 UTC,Google's carbon emissions surge nearly 50% due to AI energy demand,"Google 's emissions surged nearly 50% compared to 2019, the company said Tuesday in its 2024 environmental report, marking a notable setback in its goal to achieve net-zero emissions by 2030.

Google's emissions also increased 13% year over year in 2023, per the report.

The company attributed the emissions spike to an increase in data center energy consumption and supply chain emissions driven by rapid advancements in and demand for artificial intelligence. The report noted that the company's total data center electricity consumption grew 17% in 2023.

The impact of AI on electricity demand is well documented. Electricity demand is forecast to grow as much as 20% by 2030, with AI data centers alone expected to add about 323 terawatt hours of electricity demand in the U.S., CNBC previously reported.

While renewables will likely play an important role in meeting AI energy demands, analysts say that immediate implementation is challenging. This is due to factors such as the time required to build the power lines that transport resources to the data centers, Wells Fargo analyst Roger Read previously told CNBC.

Google said in the report that its data centers are 1.8 times as energy efficient as a typical data center. The company added that it remains committed to mitigating the environmental impact of AI through model optimization, efficient infrastructure and emissions reductions.

Google is not the only major tech company to face increased emissions due to AI demand. Microsoft reported in May that its total carbon emissions rose nearly 30% since 2020 primarily due to the construction of data centers.","The company attributed the emissions spike to an increase in data center energy consumption and supply chain emissions driven by rapid advancements in and demand for artificial intelligence.

Peloton no longer faces an imminent liquidity crunch after a massive debt refinancing, but the company still has a long road ahead to fix its business and get back to profitability. In late May, the connected fitness company secured a new $1 billion term loan, raised $350 million in convertible senior notes and received a new $100 million line of credit from JP Morgan and Goldman Sachs. All of those are due in 2029. The refinance reduced Peloton's debt from about $1.75 billion to around $1.55 billion and pushed off looming due dates on loans that it likely wouldn't have had the cash to pay back. Before the refinancing, Peloton would have needed to pay around $800 million toward its debt by November 2025. If it managed to pay that, about another $200 million still would have been due around three months later. The term loan would have been due in May 2027. For Peloton, which hasn't turned a net profit since December 2020 and has seen sales fall for nine straight quarters, the debt pile posed an existential threat and fueled investor concerns about a possible bankruptcy. Now that it has refinanced, Peloton has eased investor concerns about liquidity and has the breathing room it needs to try to turn around its business. The fact that it was able to secure these loans signals investors believe in its ability to rightsize its business and eventually pay them back, restructuring experts told CNBC. ""This refinancing is now putting us in a much better position for sustainable, profitable growth and just a much stronger financial footing than where we were before, and our investors saw that,"" finance chief Liz Coddington told CNBC in an interview. ""I think they believe in the story. They believe in what we're trying to do, as do we, and in the transformation of the business. And so it was just a great vote of confidence for Peloton's future.""

Peloton faces risks ahead

While the refinance may have bought Peloton some time, it's far from a panacea. Under the terms, Peloton will now be spending about $133 million annually in interest, up from around $89 million previously. It will make Peloton's efforts to sustain positive free cash flow more difficult. Coddington acknowledged to CNBC that the higher interest expense is going to ""impact"" free cash flow, but said that's partly why the company started to cut costs in early May. The plan is expected to reduce annual run-rate expenses by more than $200 million. Even with the higher interest payments, Coddington expects the company will be able to sustain positive free cash flow without having the business ""materially grow in the near term."" ""The cost reduction plan made us much more comfortable with that,"" said Coddington. While Peloton insists that investors bought into its refinance because they believe in its strategy, some could be trying to put themselves in a better position if the company fails. Two of Peloton's largest debt holders, Soros Fund Management and Silver Point Capital, are known to sometimes invest in distressed companies. Since the Peloton loans they invested in are secured, they are near the top of the capital structure. If Peloton can't turn its business around and ends up in a position where it's considering or filing for bankruptcy, its creditors would be in a strong position to take control of the company. ""I would describe this refinancing slash recapitalization as sort of opportunistic,"" said Evan DuFaux, a special situations analyst at CreditSights and an expert in distressed debt. ""I think that's just sort of a smart, opportunistic and kind of tricky move."" Silver Point declined to comment. Soros didn't return a request for comment.

More cost cuts to come?

Peloton is in a far better cash position than it was a few months ago, but the company still needs to address the demand issues that have plagued it since the Covid-19 pandemic wound down and figure out what kind of business it will be in the future. ""It really is an exercise in kicking the can down the road because the refinancing itself buys time, but it doesn't actually fix any of the underlying problems at Peloton,"" said Neil Saunders, managing director of GlobalData Retail. ""Those are very different issues to the refinancing."" Following former CEO Barry McCarthy's departure and with two board members, Karen Boone and Chris Bruzzo, now in charge, Peloton needs to decide: is it a content company, like the Netflix for fitness, or is it a hardware company that needs to develop new strategies to sell its pricey equipment? So far, straddling both has proven to be unsuccessful. ""They're going to have to make some decisions about which parts of the model are survivable, which parts are not, or things that they can do to advance forward without losing the great brand value that they still currently have, especially with the loyal following that they have,"" said Scott Stuart, the CEO of the Turnaround Management Association and an expert in corporate restructurings. ""Money doesn't fix everything, and the issue becomes the more money you take and the more you refinance ... the more problematic it becomes,"" he added. Simeon Siegel, a retail analyst for BMO Capital Markets, said Peloton can start addressing its issues by forgetting about trying to grow the business for now and instead focus on ""bear hugging"" its millions of brand loyalists. He pointed out that the company makes about $1.6 billion in recurring, high-margin subscription revenue and sees more than $1.1 billion in gross profit from that side of the business. ""The problem is, they lose money. How do you lose money if you're generating a billion one of recurring gross profit dollars?"" said Siegel. ""Well, you take all of that gross profit and you spend it to try and chase new growth."" He said Peloton could generate around $500 million in EBITDA if it cuts research and development, marketing and other corporate expenses. For example, Peloton's marketing budget is around 25% of annual sales, and if the company reduces it to even 10%, it would still be in the ""upper echelon of most brands,"" said Siegel. ""Their debt is scary on a company that's burning cash, their debt's not scary at all on a company that can make half a billion dollars of EBITDA,"" he said. ""They have a business that's generating a tremendous amount of cash. They need to stop spending it."" In May, Peloton announced it would cut 15% of its corporate workforce, but it may be more reluctant to back off its growth strategy. Peloton founder John Foley set a goal of growing to 100 million members, and McCarthy adopted the target when he took over. As of the end of March, Peloton had about 6.6 million members — woefully behind that long-term target. Since the company announced its cost cutting plan, McCarthy's departure and another disastrous earnings report in early May, Peloton has been largely mum on its strategy. It said that it's searching for a new permanent CEO, and the person it hires will offer clues about the company's direction. If it hires another ""hyper growth tech CEO"" like McCarthy – who had done stints at Netflix and Spotify – then Peloton will likely face the same issues, Siegel said. But if it taps someone different, it could signal a strategy shift.

It will make Peloton's efforts to sustain positive free cash flow more difficult. Coddington acknowledged to CNBC that the higher interest expense is going to ""impact"" free cash flow, but said that's partly why the company started to cut costs in early May. The plan is expected to reduce annual run-rate expenses by more than $200 million. Even with the higher interest payments, Coddington expects the company will be able to sustain positive free cash flow without having the business ""materially grow in the near term."" ""The cost reduction plan made us much more comfortable with that,"" said Coddington. While Peloton insists that investors bought into its refinance because they believe in its strategy, some could be trying to put themselves in a better position if the company fails. Two of Peloton's largest debt holders, Soros Fund Management and Silver Point Capital, are known to sometimes invest in distressed companies. Since the Peloton loans they invested in are secured, they are near the top of the capital structure. If Peloton can't turn its business around and ends up in a position where it's considering or filing for bankruptcy, its creditors would be in a strong position to take control of the company. ""I would describe this refinancing slash recapitalization as sort of opportunistic,"" said Evan DuFaux, a special situations analyst at CreditSights and an expert in distressed debt. ""I think that's just sort of a smart, opportunistic and kind of tricky move."" Silver Point declined to comment. Soros didn't return a request for comment.

More cost cuts to come?

Peloton is in a far better cash position than it was a few months ago, but the company still needs to address the demand issues that have plagued it since the Covid-19 pandemic wound down and figure out what kind of business it will be in the future. ""It really is an exercise in kicking the can down the road because the refinancing itself buys time, but it doesn't actually fix any of the underlying problems at Peloton,"" said Neil Saunders, managing director of GlobalData Retail. ""Those are very different issues to the refinancing."" Following former CEO Barry McCarthy's departure and with two board members, Karen Boone and Chris Bruzzo, now in charge, Peloton needs to decide: is it a content company, like the Netflix for fitness, or is it a hardware company that needs to develop new strategies to sell its pricey equipment? So far, straddling both has proven to be unsuccessful. ""They're going to have to make some decisions about which parts of the model are survivable, which parts are not, or things that they can do to advance forward without losing the great brand value that they still currently have, especially with the loyal following that they have,"" said Scott Stuart, the CEO of the Turnaround Management Association and an expert in corporate restructurings. ""Money doesn't fix everything, and the issue becomes the more money you take and the more you refinance ... the more problematic it becomes,"" he added. Simeon Siegel, a retail analyst for BMO Capital Markets, said Peloton can start addressing its issues by forgetting about trying to grow the business for now and instead focus on ""bear hugging"" its millions of brand loyalists. He pointed out that the company makes about $1.6 billion in recurring, high-margin subscription revenue and sees more than $1.1 billion in gross profit from that side of the business. ""The problem is, they lose money. How do you lose money if you're generating a billion one of recurring gross profit dollars?"" said Siegel. ""Well, you take all of that gross profit and you spend it to try and chase new growth."" He said Peloton could generate around $500 million in EBITDA if it cuts research and development, marketing and other corporate expenses. For example, Peloton's marketing budget is around 25% of annual sales, and if the company reduces it to even 10%, it would still be in the ""upper echelon of most brands,"" said Siegel. ""Their debt is scary on a company that's burning cash, their debt's not scary at all on a company that can make half a billion dollars of EBITDA,"" he said. ""They have a business that's generating a tremendous amount of cash. They need to stop spending it."" In May, Peloton announced it would cut 15% of its corporate workforce, but it may be more reluctant to back off its growth strategy. Peloton founder John Foley set a goal of growing to 100 million members, and McCarthy adopted the target when he took over. As of the end of March, Peloton had about 6.6 million members — woefully behind that long-term target. Since the company announced its cost cutting plan, McCarthy's departure and another disastrous earnings report in early May, Peloton has been largely mum on its strategy. It said that it's searching for a new permanent CEO, and the person it hires will offer clues about the company's direction. If it hires another ""hyper growth tech CEO"" like McCarthy – who had done stints at Netflix and Spotify – then Peloton will likely face the same issues, Siegel said. But if it taps someone different, it could signal a strategy shift.

Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., speaks during the anniversary of the Inflation Reduction Act event at the White House in Washington, Aug. 16, 2023.

Former House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, of California, and House Rep. Jim Clyburn, of South Carolina, both Democrats, said Tuesday it is fair to raise concerns about President Joe Biden's fitness after he stumbled through his first debate with former President Donald Trump on Thursday.

""I think it's a legitimate question to say, 'Is this an episode or is this a condition?'"" Pelosi said in an MSNBC interview, noting that the question should be asked of both Biden and Trump.

In a separate MSNBC interview shortly after, Clyburn echoed that it is reasonable to wonder whether Biden's debate performance is a signal of a larger medical issue: ""I'll have to wait on the experts in medicine to give their opinion, because I'm not a doctor, so I have no idea the extent to which all of this may have occurred.""

Clyburn added he has a phone call with Biden scheduled for later Tuesday.

In response to Pelosi and Clyburn's comments, the White House said questioning the president's cognitive abilities is ""fair"" but that the administration has been transparent enough about his medical records.

""I get the question. It is a fair question to ask,"" White House Press Secretary Karine Jean-Pierre said at a Tuesday press briefing when asked about Pelosi's comments. ""As it relates to his medical records, we have been transparent, we have released thorough reports from his medical team every year.""

She added that Biden's medical team does not find further cognitive testing warranted, despite his poor debate showing.

Jean-Pierre also said that Biden's doctor, Kevin O'Connor, did not have any concerns about the president's medical status after the debate: ""Not at all.""

Pelosi's and Clyburn's comments come as Democrats monitor the scale of damage from Biden's difficult debate. Several polls so far have found that the Biden-Trump rematch remains a near dead heat.

A new CNN poll published Tuesday found Trump with a 6-point lead on Biden in a head-to-head matchup, unchanged from the survey's April results. The margin of error for that question was plus or minus 3.7 percentage points.

The poll surveyed 1,045 registered voters from June 28 to 30, the three days following the debate, which means it represents respondents' immediate reactions.

Both Democrats reiterated their support for Biden for as long as he stays in the presidential race.

""I want this ticket to continue to be Biden-Harris, and then we'll see what happens after the next election,"" Clyburn said.","Rep. Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., speaks during the anniversary of the Inflation Reduction Act event at the White House in Washington, Aug. 16, 2023.

President Joe Biden's campaign announced in an email that it raised $127 million in June, with over $30 million brought in since his disastrous debate performance against Donald Trump on Thursday.

Biden's team noted that the money was raised for Team Biden-Harris, which includes the political entities of the Biden campaign, his joint fundraising committees, the Democratic National Committee and dozens of state parties across the country.

The high fundraising total suggests that those who often contribute smaller amounts of money are sticking with the president, even though wealthy Democratic donors and fundraisers sounded the alarm about the president's sluggish debate.

The campaign said that ""nearly two-thirds [of] June's raise came from grassroots donors, and of the $38 million raised in the final few days of the month, more than $30 million came from grassroots donations."" The campaign also said its political operation went into the third quarter with $240 million on hand.

Still, the public and private criticism by party officials, including some Democrats in Congress, has not subsided despite Biden's effort to calm their nerves.

""I think like a lot of people I was pretty horrified,"" said Sen. Sheldon Whitehouse, D-R.I. about the debate on Monday in an interview for a local television station.

""I think people want to make sure that this is a campaign that's ready to go and win, that the president and his team are being candid with us about his condition — that this was a real anomaly and not just the way he is these days,"" Whitehouse said.

Rep. Jamie Raskin, D-Md. said in an interview with MSNBC on Sunday that Biden's debate performance was a ""big problem,"" and there are discussions up and down the Democratic Party about what took place on Thursday in Atlanta.

""So this makes it a difficult situation for everybody, but there are very honest and serious and rigorous conversations happening at every level of our party because it is a political party and we have differences in point of view,"" said Raskin.

Raskin noted that if Biden announces he will not stand for reelection, the party will be united around someone else.

""One thing I can tell you is that regardless of what President Biden decides, our party is going to be unified, and our party also needs him at the very center of our deliberations and our campaign,"" said Raskin. ""And so whether he's the candidate or someone else is the candidate, he is going to be the keynote speaker at our convention. He will be the figure that we rally around to move forward, and beat the forces of authoritarianism and reaction in the country.""

CNBC,https://www.cnbc.com/2024/07/02/gm-q2-2024-auto-sales.html,2024-07-02,16:20:14 UTC,GM reports best U.S. quarterly sales since 2020,"Vehicles are offered for sale at a GM dealership in Lincolnwood, Illinois, on June 20, 2024.

DETROIT — General Motors reported its best quarterly sales in more than three years, including notable increases in full-size pickup trucks and all-electric vehicles.

The Detroit automaker on Tuesday reported sales of 696,086 for the second quarter, up 0.6% from a year earlier and its highest quarterly units sold since the fourth quarter of 2020.

Its EV deliveries increased 40% compared to a year earlier to 21,930 units. Still, EVs made up only 3.2% of its total second-quarter sales.

Sales of GM's full-size pickup trucks were roughly 229,000 during the second quarter, up about 6% from a year earlier and the best quarterly sales since 2021.

GM's total sales through the first half of the year were down 0.4%, however, compared to a year earlier to roughly 1.3 million vehicles.

GM's second-quarter sales are expected to slightly outpace the overall industry. Auto industry forecasters such as Cox Automotive and Edmunds expect second-quarter sales industrywide, including July 1, to be roughly level from a year earlier amid slowing retail demand.

An unknown outlier in the second quarter is how much of an effect cyberattacks on dealer software provider CDK Global will have on sales. The June 19 ransomware attack forced CDK, a market leader, to shut down its dealer management system, affecting close to half of all dealerships in North America.

""The CDK cyberattacks have thrown a monkey wrench into sales during the second half of June, affecting what is arguably one of the most lucrative and busiest times of the month and quarter for dealerships,"" said Jessica Caldwell, Edmunds' head of insights.

GM, in a statement, said its ""dealers who use the CDK platform are working to meet strong customer demand under difficult circumstances. Some deliveries may be delayed until Q3.""

Dealers, including the industry's largest publicly traded ones, were forced to delay sales or figure out workarounds to sell vehicles since the attacks occurred.

All six of the major publicly traded franchised dealership groups have disclosed their exposure to the CDK issue.

DETROIT — General Motors reported its best quarterly sales in more than three years, including notable increases in full-size pickup trucks and all-electric vehicles.

The Detroit automaker on Tuesday reported sales of 696,086 for the second quarter, up 0.6% from a year earlier and its highest quarterly units sold since the fourth quarter of 2020.

Its EV deliveries increased 40% compared to a year earlier to 21,930 units. Still, EVs made up only 3.2% of its total second-quarter sales.

Sales of GM's full-size pickup trucks were roughly 229,000 during the second quarter, up about 6% from a year earlier and the best quarterly sales since 2021.

GM's total sales through the first half of the year were down 0.4%, however, compared to a year earlier to roughly 1.3 million vehicles.

GM's second-quarter sales are expected to slightly outpace the overall industry. Auto industry forecasters such as Cox Automotive and Edmunds expect second-quarter sales industrywide, including July 1, to be roughly level from a year earlier amid slowing retail demand.

An unknown outlier in the second quarter is how much of an effect cyberattacks on dealer software provider CDK Global will have on sales. The June 19 ransomware attack forced CDK, a market leader, to shut down its dealer management system, affecting close to half of all dealerships in North America.

""The CDK cyberattacks have thrown a monkey wrench into sales during the second half of June, affecting what is arguably one of the most lucrative and busiest times of the month and quarter for dealerships,"" said Jessica Caldwell, Edmunds' head of insights.

GM, in a statement, said its ""dealers who use the CDK platform are working to meet strong customer demand under difficult circumstances. Some deliveries may be delayed until Q3.""

Dealers, including the industry's largest publicly traded ones, were forced to delay sales or figure out workarounds to sell vehicles since the attacks occurred.

All six of the major publicly traded franchised dealership groups have disclosed their exposure to the CDK issue. Five of the six — Asbury Automotive Group , AutoNation Inc. , Group 1 Automotive Inc. , Lithia Motors Inc. and Sonic Automotive Inc. — use CDK as their primary dealership management system provider, according to Automotive News.

The Florida Panthers are skating to a new TV home.

The National Hockey League Stanley Cup champions have inked a deal to air regular season games on local broadcast networks in Florida and leave behind the cable TV regional sports network that has long been their home.

The Panthers, which have appeared in the Stanley Cup finals two years in a row, signed a multiyear deal with E.W. Scripps that allows the broadcast station owner to televise all locally produced Panthers preseason and regular season games as well as round one of the playoffs.

The Panthers are also working with Scripps Sports to launch a streaming service, with further details expected prior to the start of the 2024 season.

Terms of the deal, which begins this coming season, were not disclosed.

Professional sports teams have been increasingly opting for deals with local broadcast station owners as the regional sports network business is dragged down by consumers leaving the pay TV bundle in favor of streaming.

In particular, Diamond Sports Group — the owner of the Panthers' prior TV home, Bally Sports Florida — has been under bankruptcy protection since March 2023.

""After careful review and dialogue, Diamond reached a mutual agreement with the Florida Panthers to end our existing telecast rights contract,"" a Diamond spokesperson said in a statement. ""We greatly value the relationships we have built with the Panthers and their fans, and we wish them the best. We remain in productive discussions with the NHL around go-forward arrangements with our remaining team partners under contract and are focused on reorganizing as a sustainable and profitable entity.""

Since its bankruptcy filing, Diamond Sports has terminated numerous contracts with professional sports teams, which have in turn found new homes on broadcast TV networks.

It has evolved into a significant moment of change for the industry. The regional sports network business model has long been lucrative for the leagues and teams since networks pay big fees for the rights to games that are not nationally aired.

These deals with broadcast station owners promise a large increase in reach and audience. Games are now on broadcast networks available to all pay TV subscribers, as well as for free to people using an antenna.

However, while terms of these deals are undisclosed, they are unlikely to garner the same size contracts as those with regional sports networks. The Panthers had reportedly renewed their deal with Bally Sports Florida in 2022, doubling the value of the team's previous 10-year deal, which was about $6 million a year.

Last year, Scripps signed a similar deal with the 2023 Stanley Cup champions, the Las Vegas Golden Knights.

Meanwhile, the National Basketball Association's Phoenix Suns and Utah Jazz are also aired on local broadcast stations. Various broadcast station owners have shown interest in becoming the homes of professional sports as the traditional RSN business is under considerable stress.

There may be more opportunities, too, as Diamond Sports is still working to exit bankruptcy protection.

Last month, the leagues expressed concern over Diamond Sports' future, and whether it would be able to put together a viable business plan ahead of the upcoming seasons. Diamond Sports returns to bankruptcy court later this month to seek approval for its reorganization plan.","Sergei Bobrovsky, #72, and the Florida Panthers celebrate the Stanley Cup win following a 2-1 victory over the Edmonton Oilers in Game 7 of the NHL Stanley Cup Final at Amerant Bank Arena in Sunrise, Florida, on June 24, 2024.

CNBC,https://www.cnbc.com/2024/07/02/nvidia-and-apple-get-investing-club-price-target-hikes-on-ai-potential.html,2024-07-02,19:46:49 UTC,"We're hiking price targets on our only 'own it, don't trade it' stocks due to a common theme","We're raising our price targets on the Investing Club's only ""own it, don't trade it"" stocks — Nvidia and Apple — two mega-cap tech names that have been winners this year with more room to run. Nvidia We're boosting our Nvidia price target to $150 per share from $120 — representing an increase of more than 20% from Monday's close. The artificial intelligence giant, which briefly became the most valuable U.S. company a couple of weeks ago, has come off the boil a bit recently. On Tuesday, it was just hanging onto a $3 trillion market cap. For investors with no Nvidia exposure, the stock on Tuesday was near one of three possible buy levels we identified last week . It dipped briefly below intraday Monday. We're considering an upgrade from our wait-for-a-pullback 2 rating given the stock's roughly 12% decline from last month's all-time intraday high of nearly $141 to Monday's close. However, in 2024 alone, the stock is up over 145% — far and away our best performer this year. But given that run, we're reiterating our wait-for-a-pullback 2 rating for now. NVDA 5Y mountain Nvidia 5 years As strong as Nvidia shares have been since their October 2022 closing low of $11.23 each – an over 1,000% surge since then – we continue to see further strength ahead. The catalysts include sustained demand for the company's AI hardware solutions along with the upside potential from its growing services offerings. After soaring on earnings in May and gaining ground since last month's 10-for-1 stock split, the primary concern behind the stock's recent decline has been whether Nvidia's clients might pause hardware spending as the chipmaker transitions from its Hopper suite to the new Blackwell architecture. That worry is misplaced because industry checks continue to indicate that won't be the case. The need for accelerated computing is too great and the vast majority of the world's data centers were not built from the ground up with AI workloads in mind. As a result, we believe companies big and small are in the early stages of a massive investment cycle. Nvidia's services revenue is not yet material to earnings, but we continue to see several avenues for growth. Nvidia has solutions for many key industries including health care and autonomous vehicles. We believe the addressable markets for those verticals are large and only getting larger. Health care revenue at Nvidia has already exceeded a $1 billion run rate. The company is also proving to be a key partner for many of the world's auto industry OEMs (original equipment manufacturers). The expectation is that Nvidia will share in the revenue streams associated with self-driving vehicle subscriptions. Back in 2021, at the Nvidia investor day conference, founder and CEO Jensen Huang provided an example of how big the auto market could be one day. ""There are 100 million cars sold a year and that's the entire opportunity annually for chips, 100 million cars."" At the time, Jensen said hypothetically if there's $1,000 worth of Nvidia hardware in each car, that's a $100 billion opportunity. ""However, those cars are driven 10 trillion miles,"" he estimated. If Nvidia were to get $1 per mile as part of a services subscription, he projected, ""It's $10 trillion – and so, that kind of gives you a sense of the economics involved."" However you want to slice it, when we consider that current revenue estimates are for Nvidia to do $120 billion this fiscal year, with only $1.4 billion coming from automotive, it's clear that this segment alone has the potential to materially impact total revenues over the coming decade. Bottom line : Near-term we expect the yet-to-be-shipped Blackwell chip platform to result in continued growth. However, we see plenty of opportunities for even more growth as we look longer-term to these new services-oriented opportunities. Apple We're also increasing our Apple price target to $240 per share from $220. But we're reiterating our 2 rating with the stock back to all-time highs intraday Tuesday. The stock had a rough start to the year. But it bottomed in mid-April and found its footing. Then better-than-feared earnings in early May catapulted the stock higher. It got another boost in June after the company unveiled its artificial intelligence strategy. Like other tech stocks, Apple dipped recently. But unlike Nvidia, that weakness was short-lived. AAPL 5Y mountain Apple 5 years We like what we saw at Apple's annual Worldwide Developers Conference (WWDC) and continue to believe that the inability to leverage the new Apple Intelligence AI offering on anything less than last year's iPhone 15 Pro provides the setup for one of the strongest refresh cycles we've seen in years. Keep in mind, we haven't even seen what new features the iPhone 16 will have beyond the AI tools. New iPhone launch events are usually in September. In addition to a hardware upgrade cycle, we think the introduction of generative AI and integrating it more deeply with users' personal devices – in a way only Apple can – will provide for a new level of service opportunities, resulting in a greater share of revenue coming from this recurring, high-margin segment of the operation. Bottom line : We think the introduction of Apple Intelligence — as well as the potential for what spatial computing (the mixed reality Vision Pro headset) can become as the form factor of devices (and prices) decrease —represents the beginning of a new generation for Apple.

Your state could be next","An insurance crisis that has sent premiums skyrocketing and caused carriers to flee coastal states like Florida and California is spreading, and it is fundamentally changing the real estate market in states across the country.

""Not only is the cost higher than people anticipated, but just the inability to secure insurance at all makes deals fall through before they even happen,"" said Bill Baldwin, owner of Boulevard Realty in Houston.

Increasingly, Baldwin said, he and other brokers are seeing insurance companies swoop in just as deals are about to close, making nearly impossible demands.

""A new roof, for roofs that are only seven years old, or 10 years old. They want trees cut down that are within 20 feet of the edge of the house. Oftentimes those trees are on the neighbor's property,"" he said.

""And when that can't happen, you can't get insurance, which causes the sale to fall through.""

A similar dynamic is playing out in commercial real estate, said Ross Markowitz, director of insurance risk management at AEW Capital Management, a global real estate investment advisory firm in Boston.

""We're having to really educate our internal teams,"" he said. ""Don't expect your buyers to be able to get the pricing of insurance that we have, so they'll probably [want] to offer less for the deal.""

Mounting insurance losses

The new dynamic comes after several years of staggering losses for the insurance industry from natural disasters, including nearly $80 billion in insured losses last year alone, according to the Insurance Information Institute.

""It's directly related to climate risk,"" said Jeremy Porter, head of climate implications at the nonprofit First Street Foundation, which quantifies climate-related risks. He said that insurance companies are increasingly interested in the organization's data.

""Insurance companies are responding to the fact that we're seeing more frequent and more severe climate events, and the fact that they're paying out more than they're bringing in,"" he said.

Leash Yu, managing director of personal lines at Higginbotham in Houston, said insurance carriers are scrambling to maintain their financial ratings and, in some cases, just to stay in business.

""There's three things they can do. They can drastically increase rates, they can get rid of some of their risks, or they can severely limit the type of the new business that comes in,"" he said. ""And some carriers are doing all three.""

Hurricanes, wildfires and extreme premiums

The crisis showed up first in Florida, which has endured three major hurricanes in two years. Florida policyholders now pay nearly five times the national average, according to Insurify. With multiple carriers either leaving the state or going out of business, the state's insurer of last resort — Citizens — has seen its policy count triple in four years, to nearly 1.2 million. Now, Citizens is asking regulators to approve a 14% rate increase.

In California, where at least eight carriers have left the state or limited their exposure, that state's insurer of last resort — the California FAIR Plan— has seen a 14% jump in policyholders this year alone, and a 137% increase since 2019.

In Louisiana, homeowners are paying roughly three times the national average, according to Insurify.","An insurance crisis that has sent premiums skyrocketing and caused carriers to flee coastal states like Florida and California is spreading, and it is fundamentally changing the real estate market in states across the country.

Bill Pugliano | Getty Images

At a June 18 campaign rally in Racine, Wisconsin, former President Donald Trump slammed the Biden administration's efforts to forgive student debt as ""vile"" and ""not even legal."" ""The students aren't buying it, by the way,"" Trump said to a crowd of a couple of thousand people near Lake Michigan. Trump also brought up the Supreme Court's decision in 2023 to block President Joe Biden's first attempt at broad student loan cancellation: ""He got rebuked, and then he did it again."" ""It's going to get rebuked again even more,"" Trump said. As president, Trump called for the elimination of the U.S. Department of Education's existing loan relief programs, including the popular Public Service Loan Forgiveness initiative, which benefits public employees such as members of the U.S. Armed Forces, first responders, public defenders, prosecutors and teachers. He also wanted to slash the department's budget, and his administration halted a regulation aimed at providing loan forgiveness to those defrauded by their schools. Now, as he runs for president again, Trump seems poised to make even deeper cuts to financial aid programs for students. He has repeatedly attacked Biden's loan relief policies, and he said in a campaign video in late 2023 that he wants to close the Education Department altogether. Outstanding education debt in the U.S. exceeds $1.6 trillion, according to a 2022 report by the nonpartisan Congressional Research Service. Nearly 43 million people — or 1 in 6 adult Americans — carry student loans, the report said.

Project 2025, a set of proposals developed by The Heritage Foundation from more than 100 conservative organizations, says that ""student loans and grants should ultimately be restored to the private sector."" (Some conservatives argue that private companies would do a better job lending to students than the federal government.) The proposal also calls for reducing affordable repayment options for borrowers and ending the loan forgiveness offered under these plans after a certain period. ""Trump will undo President Biden's student loan forgiveness proposals,"" said higher education expert Mark Kantrowitz. ""He will relax rules on for-profit colleges, as part of deregulation efforts, and propose cuts, including possibly defunding the U.S. Department of Education.""

In an email response, Steven Cheung, a spokesman for the Trump campaign, referred CNBC to resources, including Trump's campaign website and a range of media articles, in which sources frame student loan forgiveness as a boon to high earners and those who attended elite colleges. Less than 1% of federal student borrowers attended Ivy League colleges, according to an estimate by Kantrowitz. Cheung did not answer specific questions from CNBC about what Trump plans to do regarding student debt and education if he is elected president.

Efforts against student loan relief already in play

Members of Trump's party, meanwhile, have already stymied many of Biden's efforts to deliver student loan relief. Most recently, lawsuits by Republican-led states, including Florida, Arkansas and Missouri, resulted in two federal judges halting implementation of key parts of the president's new repayment plan, which dramatically reduced many borrowers' monthly payments. The preliminary injunctions prevented the Biden administration from forgiving any more debt under the Saving on a Valuable Education, or SAVE, plan, and from further reducing enrolled borrowers' payments in July, as it planned. On Sunday, however, a federal appeals court granted the Education Department's request to stay one of those injunctions, allowing the department to move ahead with lowering loan bills for SAVE enrollees. Cody Gude, a social media consultant in Tampa, Florida, said he expects if Trump wins it will become more difficult and expensive for him to pay back his student loan debt of about $34,000. ""With inflation and student loans restarting, it's become a lot,"" said Gude, 35. Gude said he was upset that Florida joined the lawsuit against the SAVE plan. He said he was looking forward to his student loan bill decreasing in July so he wouldn't have to deliver groceries through Instacart anymore in addition to his regular job. ""It hurts that my home state doesn't want to help its own citizens,"" Gude said. He said he worries that if elected Trump would roll back financial relief options for young people, and that he plans to vote for Biden.

Bringing 'free market forces' to student lending

Many voters welcome Trump's stance on student loan relief and question the fairness of forgiving the loans of those who have benefited from a higher education. Just 15% of Republicans find student loan forgiveness important, compared with 58% of Democrats, according to a national poll from mid-May by the University of Chicago Harris School of Public Policy and The Associated Press-NORC Center for Public Affairs Research. The Biden administration's most recent student loan forgiveness proposal garnered a record number of public comments, with more than 148,000 people sharing their opinion. ""I call on the Biden administration to stop imposing an unjust burden on Americans who did not go to college or have paid off their student loan debt,"" one person wrote. Another commented: ""I worked overtime and three part-time jobs when I pursued a graduate degree."" ""College is a personal choice that comes with many adult decisions,"" the second person said. ""It is not the federal government's responsibility to pass those personal decisions off onto our country's taxpayers."" Elaine Parker, president of the Job Creators Network Foundation, a conservative advocacy group, said Biden was only forgiving student debt in an effort to buy votes. ""They don't want to solve the problem,"" Parker said. She said the root cause of the student loan crisis was skyrocketing college tuition.

Parker said Congress needs to hold legislative hearings and bring in campus leaders to justify their tuition hikes, excessive administrative costs and degree programs that lack transparency on career outcomes. She also said the private sector should play a bigger role in financing higher education. ""Why are the banks taken out of this?"" Parker asked. ""We've lost the free market forces in the college lending system.""

Concerns about Trump's proposals

Higher education experts and consumer advocates expressed concern about the reforms floated by conservatives and Trump. If the U.S. Department of Education were shut down, ""there would be complete chaos,"" Kantrowitz said. Such a move would mean an end to Pell Grants, one of the biggest sources of financial aid available to college students, as well as federal student loans and work study opportunities, he said. ""K-12 education would be in disarray, too,"" Kantrowitz added. Meanwhile, transferring student lending from the government to private companies would only hurt consumers and worsen the crisis, said Aissa Canchola-Banez, political director at Protect Borrowers Action. ""Private lenders put their bottom line ahead of the needs of borrowers and that is a recipe for disaster,"" Canchola-Banez said.","He also wanted to slash the department's budget, and his administration halted a regulation aimed at providing loan forgiveness to those defrauded by their schools.

Manhattan is becoming a buyer's market as apartment prices fell and inventory rose in the second quarter of 2024, according to new reports.

The average real estate sales price in Manhattan fell 3% to just more than $2 million, according to a report from Douglas Elliman and Miller Samuel. The median price fell 2% to $1.2 million, and prices for luxury apartments fell for the first time in more than a year, according to the report.

The price declines are a result of rising inventory of apartments for sale, which are also taking longer to sell. There are now more than 8,000 apartments for sale in Manhattan, which is higher than the 10-year average of about 7,000, according to Jonathan Miller, CEO of Miller Samuel, the appraisal and research firm.

Manhattan now has a 9.8 month supply of apartments for sale, which means it would take 9.8 months to sell all of the apartments on the market without any new listings, according to Brown Harris Stevens. ""Any number over 6 months tells us there is too much supply and we are in a buyer's market,"" according to the Brown Harris Stevens report.

The falling prices and rising number of unsold apartments in Manhattan stand in contrast to the national real estate landscape, where continued tight supply continues to keep prices high. Brokers and real estate analysts say the strong prices in Manhattan post-Covid became unsustainable, and both buyers and sellers are finally capitulating to a higher interest rate environment.","Manhattan is becoming a buyer's market as apartment prices fell and inventory rose in the second quarter of 2024, according to new reports.

Manhattan is becoming a buyer's market as apartment prices fell and inventory rose in the second quarter of 2024, according to new reports.

The average real estate sales price in Manhattan fell 3% to just more than $2 million, according to a report from Douglas Elliman and Miller Samuel. The median price fell 2% to $1.2 million, and prices for luxury apartments fell for the first time in more than a year, according to the report.

The price declines are a result of rising inventory of apartments for sale, which are also taking longer to sell. There are now more than 8,000 apartments for sale in Manhattan, which is higher than the 10-year average of about 7,000, according to Jonathan Miller, CEO of Miller Samuel, the appraisal and research firm.

Manhattan now has a 9.8 month supply of apartments for sale, which means it would take 9.8 months to sell all of the apartments on the market without any new listings, according to Brown Harris Stevens. ""Any number over 6 months tells us there is too much supply and we are in a buyer's market,"" according to the Brown Harris Stevens report.

European Central Bank President Christine Lagarde said Tuesday that Taylor Swift's Eras Tour is not alone in keeping inflation high across the euro zone.

Lagarde said that while services inflation remained sticky last month in the 20-nation bloc, coinciding with the European leg of Swift's sell-out tour, it could not be attributed to just one performer.

""It's not just Taylor Swift, you know,"" Lagarde told CNBC's Sara Eisen in Sintra, Portugal. ""Others have come as well.""

Lagarde was responding to a question about whether Swift's tour boosted services inflation, one of the ECB's closely watched measures.

The economic impact of Swift's sell-out tour has been well documented and comes amid concerns that central banks may not be out of the woods yet in their fight against inflation.

Terms such as ""Swiftflation"" and ""Swiftonomics"" emerged last year following a surge in spending on services such as hotels, flights and restaurants around her performances. Analysts have even suggested that the impact on key U.K. inflation readings during her London dates could prompt the Bank of England to delay an anticipated September interest rate cut.","Taylor Swift performs onstage during ""Taylor Swift | The Eras Tour"" at the Aviva Stadium in Dublin, Ireland, on June 28, 2024.

As the Federal Reserve has kept interest rates high to combat high inflation, you can easily earn 5% annual percentage yields on savings accounts and other low-risk vehicles.

Some experts are now warning it's possible to get too comfortable with those super-safe returns and miss out on bigger market returns.

""We're too obsessed with cash,"" Callie Cox, chief market strategist at Ritholtz Wealth Management, wrote last week in a blog post.

An estimated $6 trillion in cash is parked in money market funds.

Industry research finds younger investors — those with the longest time horizon to absorb risk — are allocating the most to cash.

More from Personal Finance:

Is the U.S. stock market too 'concentrated'?

Americans struggle to shake off a 'vibecession'

Retirement 'super savers' have the biggest 401(k) balances

More than half — 55% — of wealthy younger investors ages 21 to 43 ramped up their cash allocations in the past two years, compared to 46% of individuals ages 44 and up, recent research from Bank of America found.

While Bank of America focused on investors with at least $3 million in investable assets, trading and investment platform eToro earlier this year found younger investors are twice as likely as their parent's generation to have increased their cash assets. The eToro survey polled 1,000 U.S. retail investors as part of a bigger pool of 10,000 in 13 countries, and respondents held at least one investment product.

""The bigger issue that not enough people are talking about is the fact that younger investors are over-allocating the cash because of the allure of the 5% savings rate,"" Cox said in an interview with CNBC.com.

""Under-investing is a risk, and it's one that I think more younger investors are susceptible to,"" Cox said.","It wasn't long ago that investors earned practically 0% returns on cash.

Media mogul Barry Diller is taking a look at acquiring National Amusements Inc., the company owned by Shari Redstone and the controlling shareholder of Paramount, CNBC's David Faber reported on Tuesday.

Diller's IAC , an internet media and publishing company, has signed a nondisclosure agreement and is looking in the data room of National Amusements, Faber said Tuesday. IAC could make a decision in the near term to place a bid on National Amusements, which would give it a controlling stake in Paramount, he said, citing sources.

These discussions come weeks after National Amusements stopped talks with Skydance on a proposed merger with Paramount.

Following months of deal talks with a consortium that included David Ellison's Skydance and private equity firms RedBird Capital and KKR, the deal was called off as it awaited signoff from Redstone. National Amusements, which Redstone controls, holds 77% of class A Paramount shares.

Prior to calling off the proposed merger, National Amusements had agreed to financial terms of the deal, CNBC reported. The proposed deal would have seen Redstone receive $2 billion for National Amusements, with Skydance buying out nearly 50% of class B Paramount shares at $15 apiece, or $4.5 billion. Skydance and RedBird had also agreed to contribute $1.5 billion in cash to Paramount's balance sheet to help reduce debt.

Terms of IAC's potential bid are unknown, but it would likely have to be more than $2 billion, Faber reported Tuesday. The New York Times first reported Diller's interest in Paramount.

While Diller, 82, is currently the chairman of IAC and Expedia, he has a long track record in the media industry, including serving as chairman and CEO of Paramount Pictures in the 1970s and 1980s. He followed Paramount with his post at the head of 20th Century Fox, where he greenlit Fox network programs including ""The Simpsons.""

Diller has been vocal about the need for legacy media companies such as Paramount to give up on chasing Netflix in the streaming wars and focus on their broadcast and pay-TV networks.

During the Hollywood strikes last summer, he said that despite cord cutting, traditional pay-TV is still profitable — unlike most streaming businesses. He called on legacy media to build up traditional networks again.

Diller tried to acquire Paramount Pictures in the 1990s, but went toe-to-toe with Sumner Redstone, the father of Shari Redstone, who now controls the company.

Since then, Paramount has changed and grown in various ways. The company now comprises the movie studio, as well as the CBS broadcast network, a portfolio of cable TV networks such as MTV and BET plus streaming services Paramount+ and Pluto.

While other suitors have reportedly been interested in owning Paramount, the company has been focused on restructuring its business.

Now led by the so-called Office of the CEO — CBS CEO George Cheeks, Paramount Media Networks CEO Chris McCarthy and Paramount Pictures CEO Brian Robbins — Paramount has concentrated on exploring streaming joint venture opportunities with other media companies, slashing $500 million in costs and divesting noncore assets.","Media mogul Barry Diller is taking a look at acquiring National Amusements Inc., the company owned by Shari Redstone and the controlling shareholder of Paramount, CNBC's David Faber reported on Tuesday.

During the Hollywood strikes last summer, he said that despite cord cutting, traditional pay-TV is still profitable — unlike most streaming businesses. He called on legacy media to build up traditional networks again.

Diller tried to acquire Paramount Pictures in the 1990s, but went toe-to-toe with Sumner Redstone, the father of Shari Redstone, who now controls the company.

Since then, Paramount has changed and grown in various ways. The company now comprises the movie studio, as well as the CBS broadcast network, a portfolio of cable TV networks such as MTV and BET plus streaming services Paramount+ and Pluto.

While other suitors have reportedly been interested in owning Paramount, the company has been focused on restructuring its business.

Now led by the so-called Office of the CEO — CBS CEO George Cheeks, Paramount Media Networks CEO Chris McCarthy and Paramount Pictures CEO Brian Robbins — Paramount has concentrated on exploring streaming joint venture opportunities with other media companies, slashing $500 million in costs and divesting noncore assets.","Media mogul Barry Diller is taking a look at acquiring National Amusements Inc., the company owned by Shari Redstone and the controlling shareholder of Paramount, CNBC's David Faber reported on Tuesday.
Diller's IAC , an internet media and publishing company, has signed a nondisclosure agreement and is looking in the data room of National Amusements, Faber said Tuesday.
IAC could make a decision in the near term to place a bid on National Amusements, which would give it a controlling stake in Paramount, he said, citing sources.
These discussions come weeks after National Amusements stopped talks with Skydance on a proposed merger with Paramount.
Prior to calling off the proposed merger, National Amusements had agreed to financial terms of the deal, CNBC reported.","['national', 'ceo', 'deal', 'control', 'redstone', 'reported', 'streaming', 'skydance', 'gain', 'amusements', 'media', 'bid', 'barry', 'diller', 'paramount', 'weighs', 'mogul']",https://image.cnbcfm.com/api/v1/image/106216489-1572545732717nup_187507_0391.jpg?v=1572545981&w=1920&h=1080,0.03474025974025974,positive,new suitor paramount global emerg media mogul barri diller take look acquir nation amus inc compani own shari redston control sharehold paramount s david faber report tuesday diller iac internet media publish compani sign nondisclosur agreement look data room nation amus faber said tuesday iac could make decis near term place bid nation amus would give control stake paramount said cite sourc discuss come week nation amus stop talk skydanc propos merger paramount follow month deal talk consortium includ david ellison skydanc privat equiti firm redbird capit kkr deal call await signoff redston nation amus redston control hold class paramount share prior call propos merger nation amus agre financi term deal report propos deal would seen redston receiv billion nation amus skydanc buy near class b paramount share apiec billion skydanc redbird also agre contribut billion cash paramount balanc sheet help reduc debt term iac potenti bid unknown would like billion faber report tuesday first report diller interest paramount diller current chairman iac expedia long track record media industri includ serv chairman ceo paramount pictur s s follow paramount post head th centuri fox greenlit fox network program includ the simpson diller vocal need legaci media compani paramount give chase netflix stream war focus broadcast paytv network hollywood strike last summer said despit cord cut tradit paytv still profit -- unlik stream busi call legaci media build tradit network again diller tri acquir paramount pictur s went toetoto sumner redston father shari redston control compani sinc then paramount chang grown various way compani compris movi studio well cbs broadcast network portfolio cabl tv network mtv bet plus stream servic paramount pluto suitor report interest own paramount compani focus restructur busi led socal offic ceo -- cbs ceo georg cheek paramount media network ceo chris mccarthi paramount pictur ceo brian robbin -- paramount concentr explor stream joint ventur opportun media compani slash million cost divest noncor asset,0.03474025974025974,positive,15.0,0.03474025974025974,positive

A satellite dish is no longer the only way bars and restaurants can air the National Football League's package of ""Sunday Ticket"" games.

EverPass Media, the joint venture between the league and private equity firm RedBird Capital Partners that owns the commercial rights to ""Sunday Ticket,"" acquired UPshow, a platform with the tech capabilities to allow commercial establishments to stream live sports. Terms of the deal were undisclosed.

With this acquisition, bars, restaurants, casinos and other businesses will be able to stream ""Sunday Ticket"" games. Until recently, they could only do so through a subscription to satellite TV provider DirecTV.

DirecTV will remain as a distributor to bars and restaurants, however. EverPass signed a nonexclusive deal with DirecTV last year to continue to distribute ""Sunday Ticket"" games, giving it the ability to reach deals with other distribution platforms.

""More content is moving to streaming. Regardless of the streaming economics, it's become pretty clear that live sports is an important piece of that,"" said EverPass CEO Alex Kaplan. ""We're going to think about how to deliver a product and service to our customers that's becoming increasingly more challenging for them to sort of aggregate in a meaningful way. We're still in the early days ... but this is a big step for us.""

The new distribution option will be available this coming NFL season.

The acquisition for EverPass comes as more live sports games are being offered exclusively on streaming services — a new frontier for business establishments that have long subscribed to traditional pay TV packages to offer live sports.

""Sunday Ticket"" is an integral sports package for bars and restaurants since it provides all out-of-market NFL games.

In late 2022, Google' s YouTube TV acquired the residential rights to ""Sunday Ticket"" for roughly $2 billion a year, a deal which runs over seven years. DirecTV had been the owner and exclusive residential and commercial distributor of the games since the package's inception in 1994.

This followed a deal for Amazon' s Prime Video to become the exclusive home of ""Thursday Night Football"" — part of the 11-year NFL media rights agreement worth more than $100 billion.

Since then, the media rights owners of NFL games have begun to offer games simultaneously on their streaming services — and in some cases exclusively. Earlier this year Comcast 's NBCUniversal aired an NFL wild-card game on Peacock, the first time a postseason game was exclusively offered via streaming. Netflix also recently won the rights to air two NFL games on Christmas this year, and at least one on the holiday in the following two years.","A satellite dish is no longer the only way bars and restaurants can air the National Football League's package of ""Sunday Ticket"" games.

CNBC,https://www.cnbc.com/2024/07/02/us-states-with-the-highest-cost-of-living-for-single-people.html,2024-07-02,16:42:03 UTC,"The 15 U.S. states with the highest cost of living for single people—No. 1 isn't California, New York or Hawaii","You'll need to earn nearly $60,000 annually to live alone in Massachusetts, the most expensive state in the U.S. when it comes to basic costs, according to a recent SmartAsset analysis.

That figure includes estimates for how much a single-person household needs to cover housing, transportation, health care, taxes and other common expenses, as tracked by the MIT Living Wage calculator.

These expenses vary widely by state, however, especially housing, taxes and food. The biggest spread in annual cost for a single-person household is $58,009 in Massachusetts compared with $39,386 in West Virginia.

Based on a 40-hour work week, that works out to an hourly wage of about $28 in Massachusetts and about $19 in West Virginia needed to cover basic expenses.

Here's a look at the 15 U.S. states with the highest cost of living, based on how much a single person needs to cover basic costs:

Massachusetts: $58,009 Hawaii: $56,841 California: $56,825 New York: $55,878 Washington: $53,242 Colorado: $51,644 New Jersey: $51,504 Maryland: $51,460 Oregon: $50,553 Rhode Island: $50,418 Connecticut: $50,194 Virginia: $49,973 New Hampshire: $49,045 Arizona: $48,677 Georgia: $48,448

Housing is by far the biggest factor in most people's budgets. At a median of $17,000, housing costs in the 15 most expensive states are nearly double that of the 15 least expensive states.

Unsurprisingly, housing costs are higher in states with large cities, like California and New York. Big cities tend to attract people because of job opportunities, which increases the demand for homes and subsequently drives up prices.

The difference in cost of living between states is also related to food and tax costs, which vary by as much as $2,000 and $1,500, respectively.

Note that these expense estimates only cover necessities, so they don't include discretionary spending like entertainment or investment contributions.

Unfortunately, minimum wage won't cover basic expenses in any state, even for states that far exceed the federal minimum hourly wage of $7.25. This includes California's newly enacted $20 per hour minimum wage for fast food workers, which doesn't cover the $27.32 needed to pay for a single full-time worker's basic expenses in that state, according to MIT's data.

MIT's Living Wage calculator is based on data from various federal agencies, adjusted for inflation as of December 2023.

Rudy Giuliani's New York law license was revoked on Tuesday amid allegations that he assisted former President Donald Trump's failed effort to overturn the results of the 2020 election.

Giuliani's law license remains under review in Washington, D.C.

""The disciplinary charges stem from the allegations that respondent communicated demonstrably false and misleading statements to courts, lawmakers, and the public at large in his capacity as lawyer for former President Donald J. Trump and the Trump campaign in connection with Trump's failed effort at reelection in 2020,"" attorneys for the New York appeals court that issued the ruling wrote in their decision.

Giuliani was first admitted to practice law in New York in June 1969.

""Mr. Giuliani is obviously disappointed in the decision. We are weighing our appellate options,"" Giuliani's lawyer Barry Kamins said in a statement to NBC News.

The New York appeals court cited a variety of false statements Giuliani has made to allegedly help Trump convince courts to invalidate the results of the 2020 election.

Among the examples the court laid out in the filing include Giuliani claiming that there was ""endemic election fraud"" in Philadelphia; that ballots had been smuggled from Long Island, New York; that thousands of non-U.S. citizens had voted in Arizona; and that Dominion Voting Systems machines had been manipulated in Georgia.

The former New York City mayor has been embroiled in legal battles over many of these statements.

In May, the former Trump lawyer was served criminal indictment papers at his birthday party on charges related to a failed conspiracy to overturn the 2020 election in Arizona.

In December, Giuliani was ordered to pay two Georgia election workers $148 million for defamation. Giuliani falsely claimed that the election workers committed ballot fraud, one of the misleading statements he made to allegedly assist in Trump's failed effort to invalidate the 2020 election results.

Soon after that verdict, Giuliani filed for bankruptcy protection.

Taylor Swift's European tour was top of mind for Nikita Rao when planning where to go for her family's annual summer vacation. Rao, her husband and two kids, who live in Bethesda, Maryland, headed overseas this past weekend: They have tickets to the pop star's concert in Amsterdam on Thursday. The family built a weeklong itinerary around The Eras Tour event, spending a few days in London before making their way to the Netherlands for the show. They would have likely visited the two cities at some point in the future, but the Swift concert accelerated their timeline, said Rao, 43, who also saw a performance in Cincinnati last year with her daughter. ""My view on it was, we should do this — London and Amsterdam — because she'll be there,"" Rao said. ""If I can get tickets, that'll just make the whole vacation amazing,"" she said of her thought process.

Why Taylor Swift is unique to 'passion tourism'

It's not just the Rao family. Americans are flocking overseas to see Taylor Swift, perhaps the most prominent recent example of so-called ""passion tourism,"" according to travel experts. Passion tourism revolves (unsurprisingly) around people's passions. While place is also generally important, these trips are generally guided by personal interest, hobby or a cultural event, experts said. This isn't a new concept. In fact, there are many recent and upcoming examples: February's annual Carnival festival in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil; April's total solar eclipse in North America; the 2024 Paris Olympics that start this month; and the ongoing UEFA European Football Championship (known as the Euro Cup) in Germany. ""Memorable events are driving travel trends, whether it is for concerts or sporting events,"" Mastercard wrote recently in its annual travel trends report. More from Personal Finance:

""I've never seen this excitement to travel to go see an artist,"" said Jessica Griscavage, a travel advisor and founder of Runway Travel. The most recent example that might come close is a Spice Girls concert in the 1990s, she said. Griscavage, who put together the Rao family's itinerary, also assembled a separate Swift-centered trip to Paris for a daughter, mother and grandmother. More than half of Americans, 53%, identify as fans of Taylor Swift, according to a poll by Morning Consult. About 16% consider themselves ""avid"" fans.

""Beyoncé is big, too, but we don't usually get requests like, 'I have Beyoncé tickets for Europe and we want to build a trip around it,'"" said Sofia Markovich, a travel advisor and founder of Sofia's Travel. She assembled trips for two U.S. clients who had tickets for Taylor Swift shows in England and Switzerland, respectively. ""Just as Grateful Dead fans were known to follow the band from city to city to be part of a unique community, Swifties — often with friends and family in tow — have made traveling to her concerts part of the experience,"" Joshua Friedlander, vice president of research at the U.S. Travel Association, wrote recently about the so-called ""Swift Lift.""

'Inevitable' that Swifties will travel to new places

About 15.9 million Americans traveled internationally in the first quarter of 2024, an all-time high, according to Mastercard's travel report. Consumers are also spending for travel at record levels globally, it said. Passion tourism generally provides an economic boost to host nations, experts said. For example, spending by tourists at restaurants, bars and grocery stores during the 2024 Carnival in Rio was 156% above normal, Mastercard found. During the solar eclipse, hotel sales within the U.S. path of totality rose 71%, it said.

About 1.2 million fans will see a Taylor Swift concert this summer across four cities in the United Kingdom (Edinburgh, Liverpool, Cardiff and London), according to a recent Barclays analysis. Each fan will spend an average 848 British pounds (about $1,073) on tickets, travel, accommodation, outfits and other expenses, amounting to a total 997 million British pounds (about $1.3 billion), Barclays estimated. Accommodation accounts for the largest outlay after tickets, followed by travel, according to the Barclays analysis. Searches for Airbnb stays in European cities during Taylor Swift's The Eras Tour dates are up about 70% relative to the same period in 2023, according to a recent analysis.

Rome and Paris are traditionally among Americans' top destinations to visit abroad. However, it's ""inevitable"" that Swift fans will end up in a city they may have previously overlooked, like Edinburgh, said Christopher Nulty, global head of corporate communications and public affairs at Airbnb. When tickets went on sale last year for Edinburgh concert dates, searches for lodging in the city by Americans jumped 500%, Nulty said. A concert ""combines the opportunity to travel somewhere incredible with the opportunity to see an artist they love,"" he said.","Taylor Swift performs on stage during The Eras Tour on June 28, 2024 in Dublin, Ireland.

Taylor Swift's European tour was top of mind for Nikita Rao when planning where to go for her family's annual summer vacation. Rao, her husband and two kids, who live in Bethesda, Maryland, headed overseas this past weekend: They have tickets to the pop star's concert in Amsterdam on Thursday. The family built a weeklong itinerary around The Eras Tour event, spending a few days in London before making their way to the Netherlands for the show. They would have likely visited the two cities at some point in the future, but the Swift concert accelerated their timeline, said Rao, 43, who also saw a performance in Cincinnati last year with her daughter. ""My view on it was, we should do this — London and Amsterdam — because she'll be there,"" Rao said. ""If I can get tickets, that'll just make the whole vacation amazing,"" she said of her thought process.

Why Taylor Swift is unique to 'passion tourism'

It's not just the Rao family. Americans are flocking overseas to see Taylor Swift, perhaps the most prominent recent example of so-called ""passion tourism,"" according to travel experts. Passion tourism revolves (unsurprisingly) around people's passions. While place is also generally important, these trips are generally guided by personal interest, hobby or a cultural event, experts said. This isn't a new concept. In fact, there are many recent and upcoming examples: February's annual Carnival festival in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil; April's total solar eclipse in North America; the 2024 Paris Olympics that start this month; and the ongoing UEFA European Football Championship (known as the Euro Cup) in Germany. ""Memorable events are driving travel trends, whether it is for concerts or sporting events,"" Mastercard wrote recently in its annual travel trends report. More from Personal Finance:

""I've never seen this excitement to travel to go see an artist,"" said Jessica Griscavage, a travel advisor and founder of Runway Travel. The most recent example that might come close is a Spice Girls concert in the 1990s, she said. Griscavage, who put together the Rao family's itinerary, also assembled a separate Swift-centered trip to Paris for a daughter, mother and grandmother. More than half of Americans, 53%, identify as fans of Taylor Swift, according to a poll by Morning Consult. About 16% consider themselves ""avid"" fans.

""Beyoncé is big, too, but we don't usually get requests like, 'I have Beyoncé tickets for Europe and we want to build a trip around it,'"" said Sofia Markovich, a travel advisor and founder of Sofia's Travel. She assembled trips for two U.S. clients who had tickets for Taylor Swift shows in England and Switzerland, respectively. ""Just as Grateful Dead fans were known to follow the band from city to city to be part of a unique community, Swifties — often with friends and family in tow — have made traveling to her concerts part of the experience,"" Joshua Friedlander, vice president of research at the U.S. Travel Association, wrote recently about the so-called ""Swift Lift.""

'Inevitable' that Swifties will travel to new places

About 15.9 million Americans traveled internationally in the first quarter of 2024, an all-time high, according to Mastercard's travel report. Consumers are also spending for travel at record levels globally, it said. Passion tourism generally provides an economic boost to host nations, experts said. For example, spending by tourists at restaurants, bars and grocery stores during the 2024 Carnival in Rio was 156% above normal, Mastercard found. During the solar eclipse, hotel sales within the U.S. path of totality rose 71%, it said.

About 1.2 million fans will see a Taylor Swift concert this summer across four cities in the United Kingdom (Edinburgh, Liverpool, Cardiff and London), according to a recent Barclays analysis. Each fan will spend an average 848 British pounds (about $1,073) on tickets, travel, accommodation, outfits and other expenses, amounting to a total 997 million British pounds (about $1.3 billion), Barclays estimated. Accommodation accounts for the largest outlay after tickets, followed by travel, according to the Barclays analysis. Searches for Airbnb stays in European cities during Taylor Swift's The Eras Tour dates are up about 70% relative to the same period in 2023, according to a recent analysis.

Rome and Paris are traditionally among Americans' top destinations to visit abroad. However, it's ""inevitable"" that Swift fans will end up in a city they may have previously overlooked, like Edinburgh, said Christopher Nulty, global head of corporate communications and public affairs at Airbnb. When tickets went on sale last year for Edinburgh concert dates, searches for lodging in the city by Americans jumped 500%, Nulty said. A concert ""combines the opportunity to travel somewhere incredible with the opportunity to see an artist they love,"" he said.","Taylor Swift performs on stage during The Eras Tour on June 28, 2024 in Dublin, Ireland.

CNBC,https://www.cnbc.com/2024/07/02/bitcoin-to-hit-new-all-time-high-this-year-if-history-plays-out-report.html,2024-07-02,13:24:33 UTC,"History suggests bitcoin will likely hit a new all-time high this year, report says","In this photo illustration, a visual representation of the digital Cryptocurrency, Bitcoin is on display in Paris, France, on March 5, 2024.

That has been centered around an event called the halving , during which the reward for miners is cut in half, reducing the supply of bitcoin onto the market.

The bitcoin ""cycle"" refers to the period in which the digital currency ascends to a new record high, then falls again to enter a bear market or ""crypto winter."" These cycles — of which three have now been completed since the launch of bitcoin — have tended to follow a similar pattern.

ETFs allow investors to buy a product that tracks the price of bitcoin without owning the underlying cryptocurrency. Crypto proponents say this has helped legitimize the asset class and make it easier for larger institutional investors to get involved.

The journey to the record high in March was largely driven by the approval and launch of the spot bitcoin exchange-traded funds, or ETFs , in the U.S. in January. They have attracted net inflows to date of around $14.41 billion to date, according to CCData.

Bitcoin hit an all-time high of above $73,700 in March but has since been trading within a range between roughly $59,000 and $72,000.

Bitcoin has not reached the top of its current appreciation cycle and is likely to go past its all-time high this year, according to a research report released by CCData on Tuesday.

Typically, halving often occurs months before bitcoin hits an all-time high for the cycle. This current cycle has been different. Bitcoin rose to its latest record high before halving due to the bullishness around the ETFs in the U.S.

With bitcoin trading within a range after the all-time high, many have questioned whether the cryptocurrency has reached the top of the current cycle.

CCData's report, which examined historical bitcoin price movements, suggests it can reach a new height. The data and research firm said historical trends have shown that the halving event has always preceded a period of price expansion that can last anywhere from 366 days to 548 days ""before producing a cycle top, with each halving experiencing a longer cycle than the one prior, due to maturation of the asset class and lowered volatility.""

The last bitcoin halving took place on April 19 this year, so those historical timeframes have yet to pass.

""Moreover, we have observed a decline in trading activity on centralised exchanges for nearly two months following the halving event in previous cycles, which seems to have mirrored this cycle. This suggests that the current cycle could expand further into 2025,"" CCData said.

The analysts acknowledged that the ""influence of institutional participants in the industry"" in the current cycle has ""altered the previous trends,"" adding that low trading activity is likely to take place in the third quarter, which could in turn suggest more sideways price action.

""However, the data and previous trends are strong enough to suggest that any sideways price action is temporary, and we are likely to breach the previous all-time highs once again before the end of the year,"" CCData said.

The company's report said that the upcoming launch of an Ethereum ETF in the U.S. and other similar products around the world ""is destined to bring further capital, liquidity and demand to the asset class.""

CCData highlighted another key historical data point to support its thesis, saying that the price appreciation of bitcoin takes place over a short time. For example, in the 2012 cycle, 91.4% of bitcoin's overall price expansion from halving to the record high happened in the four months before the cycle peak. This share of price increase was 78.8% and 71.5% in the four months before the respective record highs of the 2016 and 2020 cycles.

""Such parabolic expansion is yet to be made in the current cycle,"" CCData said.

Other commentators have highlighted how historical patterns in bitcoin have played out.

""Historically, market cycles peak 12 to 18 months after a Bitcoin Halving, which last took place in April of this year. We also haven't seen volatility reach prior peak highs. Lastly, prior market cycle peaks coincided with a rapid succession of all time highs – upwards of 10 to 20 new highs set in a 30-day window,"" Thomas Perfumo, head of strategy at cryptocurrency exchange Kraken told CNBC by email.

Experts predicted that problems with the new Free Application for Federal Student Aid would weigh heavily on enrollment, although it was initially unclear how much of a role it would play in decisions between schools. Ellucian's study found that 44% of the 1,500 students surveyed said they'd switch their top choice school if offered just $5,000 more in aid. ""It's a surprisingly small amount when you look at the total cost,"" Ellucian CEO Laura Ipsen said of the difference that award money made in the decision-making process.

The FAFSA's impact on decision-making

""It was not only about the financial aid piece, which is huge, but comparing different offers coming in at different times,"" said Eric Greenberg, president of Greenberg Educational Group, a New York-based consulting firm. ""It did have a big impact on the way people made decisions."" In previous years, financial aid award letters were sent out at about the same time as admission letters, meaning students had several weeks to compare offers ahead of National College Decision Day, the deadline for most admitted students to decide on a college.

Because of the extensive delays this year, some students won't get their final financial aid award letter until the end of August, the U.S. Department of Education said in a recent update. That could mean some students will start their fall semester before they get key information about how much that's going to cost. It also marks ""the first admission"" by the Education Department that the FAFSA won't be fully functional until after the start of the 2024-25 award year, which began July 1, according to higher education expert Mark Kantrowitz. ""Time is so critical when students are making decisions,"" Ellucian's Ipsen said. ""The sooner you can get an offer into students' hands, the more likely they are to take it,"" she said. And it's not just about whether they will get to go to their top-choice school, she added, but whether they go to college at all.

The FAFSA is still an obstacle","Ellucian's study found that 44% of the 1,500 students surveyed said they'd switch their top choice school if offered just $5,000 more in aid.

On average, Americans say they'd need to earn around $520,000 annually to feel rich, according to the survey. Bankrate polled 2,407 adults in the U.S. online from May 16 to May 20.

That amount varies slightly by generational cohort. Here's how much each generation says they'd need to earn to feel rich, according to Bankrate.

Gen Z (ages 18 to 27): $461,000

Millennials (ages 28 to 43): $480,000

Gen X (ages 44 to 59): $574,000

Baby boomers (ages 60 to 78): $556,000

However, the typical American worker is a long way off from that income level. The median household income in the U.S. is $74,580, according to the latest available data from the U.S. Census Bureau.

Younger generations appear to be the most optimistic about their ability to achieve their financial goals in the future.

A little over 60% of Gen Zers and more than 50% of millennials say that while they're not completely financially secure, they will be someday, according to Bankrate's survey. That's compared with 48% of Gen Xers and just over a quarter of baby boomers.","Many Americans don't think they necessarily need to make $1 million a year to feel like they're well off financially, according to Bankrate's 2024 Financial Freedom survey.

Headline inflation in the euro area dipped to 2.5% in June, the European Union's statistics agency said Tuesday, while the closely watched core and services prints held steady. The headline figure was in line with the expectations of economists polled by Reuters. Inflation had nudged up from 2.4% in April to 2.6% in May. Core inflation, excluding the volatile effects of energy, food, alcohol and tobacco, stayed at 2.9% from the prior month, narrowly missing the 2.8% economists had forecast. The rate of price rises in services also failed to budge, holding at 4.1%.

Investors will now parse what the latest data means for the trajectory of interest rates in the 20-nation euro zone, following the European Central Bank's initial 25 basis point cut in June. Volatility in the consumer price index has long been expected this year, as choppy base effects from the energy market unwind. In June, year-on-year energy inflation in the euro zone was 0.2%, a sharp switch from earlier in the year when the sector had a strong disinflationary pull. On Tuesday, ECB Vice President Luis de Guindos told CNBC's Annette Weisbach that, while the central bank was confident that inflation would converge to its 2% target, the coming months would be a ""bumpy road"" and there is no ""predetermined path"" for monetary policy. He was commenting on the sidelines of the ECB Forum on Central Banking in Sintra, Portugal.

If it reaches a deal, it may kick off a new wave of streaming partnerships that could put the entire media industry on firmer footing.

Paramount Global leadership is having active discussions with other media and tech company executives to determine if a structure makes sense for both parties where Paramount+ can be merged with another streaming entity and potentially co-owned, according to people familiar with the matter, who asked not to be named because the discussions are private.

One of the companies that has expressed a desire to reach a deal is Warner Bros. Discovery , according to people familiar with the matter. Combining Max and Paramount+ could strengthen both services by allowing them to better compete with Netflix and Disney's suite of platforms (Disney+, Hulu and ESPN) for eyeballs and future content.

Warner Bros. Discovery held preliminary merger talks for a deal for all of Paramount Global earlier this year, but talks didn't escalate.

Paramount Global is also considering partnering with a technology platform, the company's co-CEO Chris McCarthy said at an employee town hall on June 25.

""What they don't have is our scale of content, and together we will make for a very powerful combination to drive more minutes and greater profits,"" McCarthy said of a potential tech partner at the town hall, according to a transcript of the event obtained by CNBC.

A merged streaming service would mitigate churn by giving customers more diverse programming and fewer reasons to cancel each month, and it could take Paramount+ losses off Paramount Global's balance sheet by giving it new ownership.

While a structure for a hypothetical joint venture with Warner Bros. Discovery hasn't been discussed in detail, ownership likely wouldn't be a 50-50 split given the existing natures of the streaming assets and their finances, according to people familiar with the discussions.

Warner Bros. Discovery's direct-to-consumer business made $103 million in annual adjusted EBITDA in 2023 after losing $2.1 billion the year before. Paramount Global reported a loss of $1.67 billion in direct-to-consumer operating income before depreciation and amortization in 2023, narrower than its $1.8 billion loss a year prior.

Max has about 100 million global subscribers, with 52.7 million based in the U.S. Paramount+ ended its first quarter with 71 million subscribers.

Comcast's NBCUniversal has also expressed interest in a joint venture with Paramount+, as The Wall Street Journal first reported earlier this year. The talks didn't progress and never got particularly far, according to people familiar with the matter.

""The sheer volume of hit content that we could offer together would be tremendous across TV, film and sports, and would attract millions of viewers,"" McCarthy said during the town hall in reference to a potential partnership with an existing subscription streaming service like Max or Peacock. ""Plus, we would share in all other non-content expenses.""

French President Emmanuel Macron is facing a reckoning after the country's far right made historic gains in the first round of a snap parliamentary election.

The National Rally, led by firebrand Marine Le Pen, and its allies secured over 33% of Sunday's vote in a staunch rebuke of Macron's centrist and globalist policies. If they go on to win an absolute majority during the vote's second round on Sunday, Macron's power will be severely weakened.

Calling the election was a high-stakes gamble for the French president who came to power more than seven years ago. He characterized the race as a choice between nationalism and demagoguery on one side and liberal values and a strong, united European Union on the other — but many now think his gamble backfired.

Thomas Piketty, bestselling French economist and economics professor, pointed to what he described as one of Macron's biggest mistakes: neglecting and demonizing France's left wing.

""What I am a bit concerned with is that the current government has tried to demonize the left in recent weeks, days, months — although Macron would never have been elected without the left,"" Piketty, author of the book ""Capital in the Twenty-First Century,"" told CNBC's ""Street Signs Europe"" on Monday.

""Without the left vote in favor of Macron against Le Pen in 2022 and 2017, he would not be president, and he never really tried to do something together in the end with the people who made him president.""

Piketty described France as having three main voting blocs: the far right, the centrist business bloc and the left. He described Macron's centrist party, Renaissance, as getting votes in ""the very fancy places of the country"" where there are concentrations of business elite, saying ""they thought they could remain in power just catering"" to that bloc.","Protesters gather during an anti-far-right rally after French President Emmanuel Macron called legislative elections following far-right parties' significant gains in European Parliament elections in Paris on June 15, 2024.

Greece has controversially introduced a six-day working week for some businesses in a bid to boost productivity and employment in the southern European country.

The regulation, which came into force on July 1, bucks a global trend of companies exploring a shorter working week.

Under the new legislation, which was passed as part of a broader set of labor laws last year, employees of private businesses that provide round-the-clock services will reportedly have the option of working an additional two hours per day or an extra eight-hour shift.

The change means a traditional 40-hour workweek could be extended to 48 hours per week for some businesses. Food service and tourism workers are not included in the six-day working week initiative.

The pro-business government of Prime Minister Kyriakos Mitsotakis has said the measure is both ""worker-friendly"" and ""deeply growth-orientated."" It is designed to support employees not being sufficiently compensated for overtime work and to help crack down on the problem of undeclared labor.

Labor unions and political observers have sharply criticized the move.

Phil Noble | Reuters

LONDON — The incoming U.K. government will confront a complex international landscape after Britons head to the polls on July 4. Labour leader Keir Starmer is widely expected to lead his party to victory, pledging to kick-start a ""decade of national renewal,"" following 14 years of rule under the Conservative Party. But the center-left politician will also be seeking to redefine the U.K.'s international image in the wake of Brexit, a recent spat of domestic political and economic blunders, and a more fractured global landscape. CNBC takes a look at the foreign policy priorities for the incoming government.

Navigating U.S.-China trade tensions

High on the new government's agenda will be maneuvering sensitive ties between global superpowers and geopolitical rivals, the U.S. and China. Labour will be eager to maintain Britain's so-called special relationship with its trans-Atlantic ally, presenting a united front in areas of shared strategic interest. But it will also need to adapt to a more protectionist and likely unpredictable U.S., particularly in the event of a change in leadership following the November presidential election stateside. ""You could imagine that the relationship between the incoming personalities of Keir Starmer and Donald Trump would be awkward,"" David Dunn, professor of international politics at the University of Birmingham, told CNBC over the phone. ""But they will work together.""

Britain is in a remarkably ambiguous position — as is the EU — dependent on China but also concerned about territorial acquisition and regional threats. David Dunn professor of international politics at the University of Birmingham

Progress on a U.K.-U.S. free trade deal — one of the key pledges of the Brexit campaign — is also likely to be limited, given current interest from both the Republican and Democrat administrations. Britain could instead be expected to focus on certain ""sector agreements"" and to continue partnerships on military and critical technologies, Chatham House directors Bronwen Maddox and Olivia O'Sullivan said in a May note. Faced with a more assertive China, Labour is likely to continue the U.K.'s current position of ""deliberate strategic ambiguity,"" Dunn said, mindful of the country's economic ties to Beijing even amid geopolitical and national security concerns. Labour ministers — like Tories — met with Chinese-founded fast-fashion giant Shein ahead of a potential London listing despite disputes over its human rights record. ""Britain is in a remarkably ambiguous position — as is the EU — dependent on China, but also concerned about territorial acquisition and regional threats,"" Dunn said.

Repairing EU relations

Labour is also likely to foster a closer working relationship with the European Union. Starmer, who campaigned for the Remain movement not to depart the bloc in the U.K.'s 2016 referendum, has said there is ""no case"" for rejoining the EU, including its single market and customs union. He has nevertheless pledged to improve the ""botched"" U.K.-EU deal, including in areas such as trade, research and security. ""There may be opportunities to revisit the core elements of the trading relationship – not immediately, but after the two sides have rebuilt trust and the relationship is working more smoothly,"" Mujtaba Rahman, Eurasia Group's managing director for Europe, told CNBC by phone.

The U.K.'s steadfast support for Ukraine amid Russia's full-scale invasion has also helped soothe ties with EU neighbors, establishing its post-Brexit role in bolstering European security. This stance looks set to be upheld under a Labour government. ""This support has strengthened the U.K.'s conversation with EU countries about common risks, in turn opening up the chance for more constructive discussion of post-Brexit relations,"" Chatham House's Maddox and O'Sullivan said.

Improving national security

Boosting the U.K.'s national security will also be a key priority for Labour amid rising global tensions and the ongoing wars in Ukraine and the Middle East. In its election manifesto, Labour mirrored Conservative plans to increase defense spending to 2.5% of gross domestic product, but replaced the 2023 timeline with ambitions to deliver the target ""as soon as we can.""

The U.K. should play a consistent role on global issues ... particularly on climate change, international development, arms control. Bronwen Maddox and Olivia O'Sullivan directors at Chatham House

Given the current geopolitical landscape, however, Chatham House advised this defense expenditure should be raised to a minimum of 3%. Starmer has also said that Labour will ""maintain an unshakeable commitment to NATO and our nuclear deterrent, and put a renewed focus on improving morale in our armed forces."" However, discussions over the future shape the trans-Atlantic military alliance are likely to continue into the next U.S. administration.

De Guindos told CNBC's Annette Weisbach that last month's French bond market moves had not been a cause for concern that would require an ECB intervention.

""What we have seen so far is that the evolution of [French] markets has been quite orderly,"" he said in an interview at the ECB Forum on Central Banking in Sintra, Portugal.

""We have seen a little bit of widening of spreads, but the situation has been under control in that respect.""

The premium on the country's borrowing costs compared to Germany's has recently been trading at its highest level since 2012. France's benchmark 10-year government bond yield has risen above 3.3%, roughly a 12-month high, since the snap election was called by President Emmanuel Macron in the middle of June.

A first-round vote over the weekend was topped by the far-right National Rally party, but analysts said the split suggested a potential hung parliament in the second round on Sunday. This was viewed as a favorable fiscal result by many investors, who are concerned about the tax and spending proposals of both the far right and the far left.

De Guindos's messaging echoed that of ECB Chief Economist Philip Lane two weeks ago, when he said June's French bond sell-off had not been ""disorderly.""

""I think that this is not about monetary policy, this is about fiscal policy,"" De Guindos told CNBC on Tuesday.

""The reason why, you know, markets would be upset ... for any government, not only for France, is that fiscal policy does not adapt to the [ECB's] new fiscal framework,"" he continued.

""So I think that the key factor here is going to be to fully respect the fiscal framework that was agreed at the beginning of this year.""

The framework released in March requires EU member states with public debt ratios above 60% of GDP or deficits higher than 3% of GDP to submit a four-year fiscal plan to the European Commission, the EU's executive arm.","French markets will be ""upset"" if the country's new government does not adhere to the European Central Bank's new fiscal rules, Luis de Guindos, the institution's vice president, said on Tuesday.

CNBC,https://www.cnbc.com/2024/07/02/hungarys-prime-minister-orban-makes-first-wartime-visit-to-ukraine.html,2024-07-02,13:58:31 UTC,Hungary’s Prime Minister Orban — a key Putin ally — makes first wartime visit to Ukraine,"Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban (L) talks with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy (R) in the Europa building prior the start of the meeting on June 27, 2024, in Brussels, Belgium.

Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban arrived in Ukraine on Tuesday for his first wartime visit to the battle-torn country.

Orban, widely viewed as Russia's closest ally within the European Union and a vocal critic of NATO's support for Kyiv, is due to meet with his Ukrainian counterpart Volodymyr Zelenskyy to discuss peace in the European region.

In a social media post following the encounter, Zelenskyy said the pair had held talks over ""the most fundamental issues of our neighbourly relations – trade, cross-border cooperation, infrastructure, and energy,"" as well as touching on ""everything that affects the lives of our people in both Ukraine and Hungary.""

He noted that this dialogue could lay the groundwork for ""a new bilateral document"" between the two nations, although no such agreement was announced on Tuesday.

Orban, meanwhile, communicated Hungary's intentions to improve ties with Ukraine and sign a broad bilateral cooperation agreement, while urging Zelenskyy to consider a quick cease-fire to accelerate peace talks, Reuters reported.

Zelenskyy has sought to gain traction for his 10-point peace framework, first released in November 2022, with Russian President Vladimir Putin last month setting out his own terms under which truce negotiations could take place. Neither proposal has been accepted by the opposing side, however.

Orban's visit crowns months of frequent opposition to the EU's financial aid packages for Kyiv. In a historic, pre-agreed move, Orban left the room in December so EU leaders could take a unanimous stance on opening accession talks with the war-torn country. The bloc formally started membership discussions with Ukraine and Moldova last week, although a long and strenuous path lies ahead.

A self-proclaimed ""peacemaker,"" Orban and his administration have refused to send weapons to Ukraine and have dissented against deeper NATO support of nonmember Kyiv — but have also agreed not to block NATO initiatives. Orban absented from last month's Ukraine Peace Summit in Switzerland, where Hungary was instead represented by Foreign Minister Peter Szijjarto.

The Hungarian prime minister has also been one of the few Western leaders to meet the increasingly isolated Kremlin leader Putin since Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine. In October, he reassured Putin that Hungary ""never wanted to confront Russia,"" The Associated Press reported.

This week's visit comes a day after Orban's nationalistic government assumed the rotating EU presidency under a ""Make Europe Great Again"" slogan sharply reminiscent of the 2016 campaign strapline of former U.S. President Donald Trump. It also takes place two weeks ahead of a key July 9-11 NATO summit where departing Secretary-General Jens Stoltenberg has signaled he expects allies to agree on further long-term financial and security assistance for Ukraine.","Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban (L) talks with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy (R) in the Europa building prior the start of the meeting on June 27, 2024, in Brussels, Belgium.

Iran is headed for a runoff election on Friday, July 5, that will see an ultra-right-wing hard-liner compete against a reformist during a time of intense economic, social and geopolitical challenges for the Middle Eastern country. The runoff will allow all 61 million eligible Iranian voters to cast their ballots after no presidential candidate managed to win a majority when the country initially voted on June 28 in a snap election, following the death of former Iranian President Ebrahim Raisi in a helicopter crash in May. Amid record-low voter turnout of around 40% on Friday — the lowest of any presidential election in the Islamic Republic's 45-year existence — two dramatically different candidates emerged on top. Reformist candidate Masoud Pezeshkian came out ahead with 10.4 million of 24.5 million votes cast, while hard-line former nuclear negotiator Saeed Jalili was just behind with 9.4 million votes. The two other candidates in Friday's race — Iranian Parliament Speaker Mohammad Bagher Qalibaf and Shiite cleric Mostafa Pourmohammadi — received 3.3 million votes and roughly 206,000 votes, respectively. Two additional candidates of the six approved to run by Iran's ultra-conservative Guardian Council had dropped out of the race on Thursday. All the candidates are seen as deeply conservative and anti-Western except for Pezeshkian.

A former nuclear negotiator, Jalili currently serves as a representative for Iran's supreme leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, on the Supreme National Security Council, known to be the most hard-line wing of the regime and its highest security body. Jalili, 58, is one of the furthest right-wing candidates approved to run in the snap election and is a longtime Iranian government insider, but has also had several failed attempts at running for office. Pezeshkian meanwhile, is by far the most moderate of Iran's presidential candidates. He formerly served as minister of health under Iran's last reformist president, Mohammad Khatami, from 1997 to 2005, and Khatami among other reformist politicians have endorsed him. The 69-year-old Pezeshkian has also been a member of parliament since 2008. He is a member of the Islamic Consultative Assembly and the vice speaker of parliament. He wants to loosen social restrictions like Iran's strict hijab law and improve relations with the West, including potentially restarting nuclear talks with world powers.

Japan Airlines and All Nippon Airways updated their websites Friday with ""customer harassment"" policies, in the wake of rising instances of front-line worker abuse occurring across industries in Japan.

Using similarly worded language, the two airlines cited nine behaviors that constitute ""harassment"" under the policies, including:

Abusive language, aggressive tone, insults, discrimination, slander Threatening words or actions Excessive or unreasonable demands Assault Deeds which disrupt business operations (prolonged detention, excessive repetition of requests or complaints) Unpermitted entry to workplace Deeds which deceive its employees Slander against the company or its employees on social media and the internet Sexual harassment

ANA's customer harassment policy also includes voyeurism, stalking and indecent behavior — a jarring reminder of the situations that airline employees can face in an industry that often sees travelers behaving at their worst.

The policies are meant to address a lack of clear standards which has made it difficult for employees to handle customer interactions, ANA's Yoshiko Miyashita, vice president of CS promotion, customer experience management told Nikkei Asia.

""This has placed a significant burden on our employees, leading to cases where some have been forced to take leave,"" she said.

Japan Airlines' policy also mandates airline staff to undergo harassment training — employees will be provided manuals detailing how to quickly and appropriately respond to ""malicious"" behavior.

""We have also established aftercare support for our staff's physical and mental health,"" according to the airline.

Both airlines' policies state that travelers who harass employers will be issued a warning, after which consequences can include denial of boarding and police involvement.","Japan's two largest commercial airlines are toughening their stances against travelers who verbally or physically abuse airline staff.

But the one thing they all have in common is that they're irrational, according to one phobia specialist.

""A phobia is an irrational response to a benign substance,"" Christopher Paul Jones, a London-based phobia specialist with a clinic on London's Harley Street, told CNBC Make It in an interview.

""As human beings, we are primitively hardwired that when we experience danger, our amygdala fires off, and then we do one of several things. Most commonly fight, flight, or freeze. So, either get angry and punch the thing, or we run from the thing, or we hide from the thing,"" he said. The amygdala is a part of the brain that processes emotions like fear or motivation.

This trigger is handy when we were fighting saber-toothed tigers or if we were in actual danger, Jones said. However, a phobia is when that response is to something that isn't dangerous.

Jones' clinic has treated a variety of phobias from a fear of water, heights, germs, needles, and even the fear of failure.

He explained that phobias develop through a conditioned response like that of Pavlov's dogs experiment. That famous experiment was carried out by Russian neurologist Ivan Pavlov who would ring a bell every time he fed his dogs. The dogs eventually started to salivate when they heard the bell ring because they associated it with food.

""Human beings do the same thing,"" Jones explained. ""Most commonly with a phobia, at some point in your past, your brain has linked danger to something that has happened ... then whenever you think about that thing again in the future, it fires off that old response.""

Jones' recently published book ""Face Your Fears"" guides readers through exercises to help them overcome their fears. He shared his three top tips to overcome any fear with CNBC Make It.","Phobias come in many forms: Some people fear spiders while others fear flying on a plane.

Two couples enjoying a drink at the races.

Millennials are poised to be the wealthiest generation in history, but are they ready to handle the large inflow of money?

A vast $90 trillion wealth transfer over the next 20 years will likely make millennials ""the richest generation in history,"" according to estimates from global real estate consultancy Knight Frank.

It found that the so-called silent generation — those typically born between 1928 to 1945 — and baby boomers — born from 1946 and 1964 — will ""hand over the reins"" to millennials — those born between 1981 and 1996 — when they pass on their assets.

Millennials have been portrayed as lazy and frivolous spenders, more keen to open their purse strings for avocado toasts instead of saving for a house — so just how equipped are they in managing the seismic flow of income?

""The millennials are very ill prepared … they're not as well prepared as the wealth creating generation,"" Salvatore Buscemi, co-founder and managing partner of multi-family office Brahmin Partners told CNBC.

By the time the millennials inherit this wealth, they will be in their 40s and may not have the aptitude for starting their own business or for investing, he elaborated.

""They don't have the skill sets earlier on to be able to do that because they never had to - they were never pushed,"" he said. ""And the problem is - are they going to be motivated later in life to push themselves to acquire these skill sets?"" asked Buscemi, adding that human nature suggests that people are less inclined to pick up new skills as they age.","Millennials are poised to be the wealthiest generation in history, but are they ready to handle the large inflow of money?

When including hybrid vehicles, Li Auto remained by far the leader. It delivered 47,774 cars in June, for a first-half total of 188,981 vehicles. Most of the company's cars come with a fuel tank to extend the battery's driving range.

Xpeng remained a laggard, delivering 52,028 cars in total in the first six months of the year, including 10,668 vehicles in June.

That's slightly more than Nio 's 87,426 deliveries for the first six months of 2024, although Nio continued to recover from sluggish performance earlier in the year with a record 21,209 deliveries in June.

BEIJING — Chinese electric car company Zeekr said Monday it delivered a record number of vehicles in June, making its deliveries for the first half of the year the largest among U.S.-listed Chinese companies only selling pure electric cars.

Shares of Zeekr fell by 3.2% in U.S. trading overnight, while Li Auto and Nio both saw shares rise by more than 6%. Xpeng shares rose by nearly 5.2%.

Also offering hybrids, Huawei's jointly developed Aito brand with car manufacturer Seres delivered 184,286 vehicles in the first six months of the year.

Smartphone and home appliance company Xiaomi said it has delivered more than 10,000 cars in June, bringing total deliveries to more than 25,000 since the Hong Kong-listed company launched its electric SU7 in late March.

BYD delivered 1.6 million new energy passenger vehicles in the first half of the year, up nearly 29% from a year ago. Plug-in hybrid cars accounted for a slightly greater share than battery electric vehicles, and saw faster growth at 39.5% versus 17.7% for battery-only cars.

That reflects how much of China's new energy vehicle sales are being driven by hybrid-powered vehicles rather than purely battery-powered ones as range anxiety remains a top concern for consumers in China.

Car companies need to improve the battery charging process, Wan Gang, the man credited with spearheading China's electric car strategy, said at a conference last week.

China's new energy vehicle sales have risen this year to account for 47% of all passenger cars sold in May, according to China Passenger Car Association data, which provides figures mid-month for the prior month. That's up from 32% penetration at the start of the year.

As part of efforts to boost consumption, China this year has launched a trade-in policy to incentivize new energy vehicle sales. Many companies have also slashed prices to remain competitive, and revealed new cars at the Beijing auto show, which ended May 5.","That's slightly more than Nio 's 87,426 deliveries for the first six months of 2024, although Nio continued to recover from sluggish performance earlier in the year with a record 21,209 deliveries in June.

A bitcoin exchange that collapsed 10 years ago after being hacked is set to return billions of dollars' worth of the token to users — and it has investors worried. In a few days, bankrupt Tokyo-based bitcoin exchange Mt. Gox will begin paying back thousands of users almost $9 billion worth of tokens. The platform went under in 2014 following a series of heists that cost it in the range of 650,000 to 950,000 bitcoins, or upward of $59 billion, at current prices. The payout follows a protracted bankruptcy process that's involved multiple delays and legal challenges. On Monday, the court-appointed trustee overseeing the exchange's bankruptcy proceedings said distributions to the firm's roughly 20,000 creditors would begin in early July. Disbursements will be in a mix of bitcoin and bitcoin cash, an early offshoot of the original cryptocurrency. While this is good news for victims of the hack who have spent years waiting to be made whole, the price of bitcoin slid to $59,000 last week, in the crypto market's second-worst weekly decline of the year.

CNBC spoke to half a dozen analysts to get their take on what to expect when roughly 141,000 bitcoins — or roughly 0.7% of the total 19.7 million bitcoins outstanding — are returned to Mt. Gox victims this week.

Pressure on bitcoin could pick up

Mt. Gox — short for ""Magic: The Gathering Online Exchange"" — was once the largest spot bitcoin exchange globally, claiming to handle around 80% of all global dollar trades for bitcoin. When it shuttered in February 2014, bitcoin was worth around $600. As of Monday, the world's largest cryptocurrency is trading at about $62,000 per coin. That means users opting to be reimbursed in kind — that is, in the cryptocurrency itself, rather than the cash equivalent — have seen the value of their coins surge more than 10,000% in the last decade. John Glover, chief investment officer of crypto lending firm Ledn, told CNBC the windfall for Mt. Gox users would likely translate to huge sales in bitcoin as investors look to lock in gains. ""Many will clearly cash out and enjoy the fact that having their assets stuck in the Mt. Gox bankruptcy was the best investment they ever made,"" said Glover, who was previously a managing director at Barclays. ""Some will clearly choose to take the money and run,"" added Glover. James Butterfill, head of research at CoinShares, told CNBC the overhang of the nearly $9 billion of bitcoin set to be released has ""long been a concern for those with bullish views on bitcoin."" ""Consequently, the market is highly sensitive to any related news. With the announcement that the Trust will begin selling in July, investors are understandably worried,"" said Butterfill.

It wouldn't be the first time bitcoin's moved in reaction to big redemptions of funds locked up in centralized trading platforms. Last month, crypto exchange Gemini returned more than $2 billion worth of bitcoin to users with funds that had been trapped in its Earn lending program, marking a 230% recovery after bitcoin prices more than tripled since Gemini suspended Earn withdrawals on Nov. 16. JPMorgan analysts linked this to negative price action, saying in a research note last week that it's ""fair to assume that some of Gemini creditors, which are mostly retail customers, have taken at least partial profits in recent weeks."" The analysts expect Mt. Gox customers to be similarly inclined to sell some of their bitcoin to profit from seismic gains for the cryptocurrency. ""Assuming most of the liquidations by Mt. Gox creditors take place in July, [this] creates a trajectory where crypto prices come under further pressure in July, but start rebounding from August onwards,"" they wrote. Separately last month, the German government sold 5,000 — worth approximately $310 million as of Monday's prices — of a 50,000-bitcoin pile seized in connection with the movie piracy operation Movi2k. The funds were sent to various crypto exchanges, including Coinbase, Kraken and Bitstamp, according to blockchain intelligence firm Arkham Intelligence. Analysts say these crypto liquidations, too, have placed pressure on bitcoin's price.

Mt. Gox customers expected to hang on to their bitcoin

Most analysts agree losses in bitcoin are likely to be contained and short-lived. ""I think that sell-off concerns relating to Mt. Gox will likely be short term,"" said Lennix Lai, chief commercial officer of crypto exchange OKX. ""Many of Mt. Gox's early users as well as creditors are long-term bitcoin enthusiasts who are less likely to sell all of their bitcoin immediately,"" he said, adding previous sell-offs by law enforcement, including the Silk Road case, did not result in a sustained catastrophic price drop. Butterfill suggested there's enough market liquidity to cushion the blow of any possible mass market sell action. ""Bitcoin has maintained a daily trading volume of $8.74 billion on trusted exchanges this year, suggesting that liquidity is sufficient to absorb these sales over the summer months,"" said Butterfill. According to CCData research analyst Jacob Joseph, the markets are more than capable of absorbing the selling pressure. ""Moreover, a healthy part of the creditors are likely to take a 10% haircut on their holdings to receive the repayment early, and not all holdings are set to be liquidated on the open market, reducing the overall selling pressure,"" he said.

Recent price moves suggest the temporary impact of the Mt. Gox repayments may already be priced in, Joseph added. Galaxy Digital's head of research, Alex Thorn, believes fewer coins will be distributed than people think, meaning there will be less sell pressure than the market expects. However, he also wrote in May that, even if only 10% of the bitcoin distributed is sold, ""it will have a market impact."" ""Most of the individual creditors will have their coins deposited directly into a trading account at an exchange, making it extremely easy to sell,"" Thorn said. Vijay Ayyar, head of consumer growth for Asia-Pacific at crypto exchange Gemini, said that the overall impact of the Mt. Gox disbursement is likely to be ""dissipated,"" given the recipients of the funds are varied. On the one hand, there are individual holders who will get their bitcoin straight away. Then there's the ""significant amount"" of bitcoin that will be disbursed out to claims funds, Ayyar said. ""Those funds would then need to distribute these out to their LPs [limited partners], hence the whole process could take a while adding a time element to the impact on price,"" he told CNBC.

Macro headwinds behind bitcoin's fall

It's worth noting there are plenty of other reasons behind bitcoin's recent declines. The cryptocurrency had a stunning rally earlier this year, climbing past $70,000 on the heels of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission's approval of the first spot bitcoin ETF.

Stock Chart Icon Stock chart icon Bitcoin's U.S. dollar price performance, year-to-date.

But investors have remained anxious amid outflows from bitcoin ETFs and sizable market liquidations. The broader macro environment, too, has investors worried. Earlier this month, the Federal Reserve suggested it plans to cut rates just once this year, down from the multiple reductions it had indicated previously. Cryptocurrencies, which are inherently volatile, are particularly sensitive to changes in the interest rate environment. CoinShares' Butterfill said the Fed's new rate forecast was among ""the likely culprits for the recent price decline"" in bitcoin. This, along with other issues, is ""likely to weigh on prices in the lower volume summer months,"" Butterfill said. However, ""the fundamental investment case remains very much intact,"" he added.","In a few days, bankrupt Tokyo-based bitcoin exchange Mt.

That makes him the third-biggest Chewy shareholder, according to FactSet. Based on Friday's close, that stake is valued at more than $245 million.

The rally in Chewy shares lost steam Monday as traders reacted to a Securities and Exchange Commission filing that showed meme stock trader ""Roaring Kitty"" took a stake in the pet food e-commerce retailer.

The SEC filing also included a section that read: ""Check the appropriate box to designate whether you are a cat."" There was an ""x"" next to a response that read: ""I am not a cat."" This line was included in Gill's statement in a series of congressional hearings about 2021's GameStop trading mania.

The stock rallied more than 9% on Monday, but it quickly fell into negative territory in morning trading. Shares ended the day down 6.6%.

Chewy shares took a wild ride last week after Gill posted a picture on social media platform X of a cartoon dog that resembled Chewy's logo. The shares were up as much as 34% on Thursday but ended the day down slightly.

CNBC emailed Chewy's public relations team seeking comment on the new shareholder.

Gill is known to be a champion of GameStop and has been stirring up trading in the video game company in the last few months. In mid-June, he disclosed a stake of 9.001 million GameStop shares after exiting his massive call options position. It's unclear if he sold his GameStop bet to fund the purchase of Chewy.

GameStop shares fell more than 5% following the news.



There's a big connection between GameStop and Chewy. GameStop CEO Ryan Cohen was founder and the first CEO of Chewy, who was instrumental in PetSmart's takeover of Chewy in 2017 and its subsequent initial public offering in 2019.

Cohen joined the GameStop board of directors along with two other Chewy executives in January 2021, partly helping fuel the initial GameStop rally. He later took over as GameStop CEO in 2023, leading a turnaround in the brick-and-mortar video game retailer.

In a recent YouTube livestream, Gill said GameStop is in the second stage of a reinvention, and it has become a bet on Cohen himself, who's also been leading a pivot to e-commerce.

The investor was hit by a new class-action lawsuit filed Friday, alleging he engaged in securities fraud by manipulating GameStop's stock price through his online influence in May and June. The case was voluntarily dismissed on Monday.

Gill is a former marketer for Massachusetts Mutual Life Insurance. He came into the limelight after successfully encouraging retail investors to buy GameStop shares and call options in 2021 to squeeze out short-selling hedge funds.","This line was included in Gill's statement in a series of congressional hearings about 2021's GameStop trading mania.

Starbucks cafes across the country are starting to change how they make drink orders, among other tweaks designed to reduce bottlenecks and long wait times that have dogged the chain. The overhaul comes as the coffee giant prepares for an anticipated swell of orders through its mobile app. At the heart of the plan is Starbucks' ""Siren Craft System,"" a series of processes that are aimed at making baristas' jobs easier and speeding up service times for customers. Starbucks said more than 10% of its 10,000 stores have already implemented the system, which includes changing the production order for hot and cold drinks. It will be in use across North America by the end of July, according to the company. Executives hope the changes will provide a much-needed jolt to Starbucks. In April, the company reported a disappointing second quarter, as U.S. same-store sales fell 3% and traffic dropped 7%. The coffee chain cut its 2024 outlook. Starbucks reported rates of incomplete mobile app orders in the mid-teens and said occasional customers came in less. CEO Laxman Narasimhan mentioned the need to make improvements to stores. Katie Young, senior vice president of store operations at Starbucks, said the most immediate shift that needed to happen in cafes was better handling the unexpected. ""It's the ability to flexibly respond to things we cannot predict,"" she told CNBC in an interview.

The store changes will be key this month, as Starbucks on Monday started opening up its app to non-rewards members, which the company believes will increase traffic and orders. Analyst Peter Saleh, managing director at BTIG, said, ""My sense is that they have a lot of demand in certain stores, and the footprint of the kitchen is so small, you have to find ways to be more efficient."" Losing customers because of slow orders and other store frustrations could cost Starbucks at a particularly vulnerable time. Americans have become cost conscious in the face of ongoing inflation, and in some cases have pulled back on morning or afternoon beverages and snacks. Narasimhan in April said consumers are spending more cautiously. Starbucks has done something uncharacteristic in recent weeks, joining the stream of value offerings with a $5 food and beverage combo option. Communicating value to customers is also part of the plan to drum up business.

The Siren system

Starbucks has been diagnosing the bottleneck issue for more than a year, since the company's reinvention plan rollout in 2022, said Young. At the time, Howard Schultz was at the helm, having returned during a burgeoning unionization movement and shifts in consumer preferences. The changes underway in cafes were first previewed that fall, to be rolled out in the years to come. Narasimhan took over for Schultz in March 2023. The Siren system processes were developed with worker feedback on which issues stopped them from creating beverages and connecting with customers. Starbucks said it plans to add a role akin to an expediter in a restaurant production line, a ""play caller"" who steps away from production and helps solve logjams in cafes, handling tasks such as restocking cups or helping when an unexpected crowd arrives. The company plans to train existing workers for the role or potentially add new baristas, if needed. ""One of the pain points we saw was [that] our espresso machine was often running all the time, and that was one of the things that kept our partners from being able to check in. And another thing we saw that you didn't necessarily know was which part of the store would get crowded,"" Young said. ""We needed to actually have a partner that was dedicated when things got busy to pulling out of production and just helping."" Starbucks said it will also change the order in which beverages are made. Previously, cold drinks were prioritized from start to finish, even if a hot beverage order came in first, as pulling espresso shots was the last step. This could create a traffic jam in the drive-thru, for example, if a person ordered one of each beverage, as the cold item would be ready while the hot drink was still in production. Macoy McLaughlin, manager of Seattle's First and Walker Starbucks location, said producing beverages in the order they were placed allows for a faster, streamlined process. ""We actually have proper sequencing between our hot and cold bars, versus cold bars becoming as popular as ever, to really have a consistent experience for the customers. So we're actually making them in the order they're coming in,"" McLaughlin said, adding that the cafe feels busier, but customers in store and in the drive-thru are getting drinks faster. Baristas also will have more control over the company's digital production manager, an iPad system that controls the sequencing of orders in various channels from cafes, mobile orders and the drive-thru, the company said. Workers will have more flexibility over changing order priority.

Although the unemployment rate has spent 30 months at or below below 4% — a near record — not everyone who wants a job has one. And not everyone even wants a job at all. Some, referred to as ""NEETs,"" which stands for ""not in employment, education, or training,"" are opting out of the labor force largely because they are discouraged by their economic standing. Others, alternatively, are well-qualified but often younger candidates who are struggling to find positions, comprising a contingent of ""new unemployables,"" according to a recent report by Korn Ferry.

Among 16- to 24-year-olds, the unemployment rate rose to 9% in May, which is ""typical,"" according to Alí Bustamante, a labor economist and director of the Worker Power and Economic Security program at the Roosevelt Institute, a liberal think tank based in New York City. Although the youth unemployment rate fell below 7% in 2023, according to the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics, such lows were ""emblematic of how hot the labor market was at that point,"" Bustamante said. ""9% is basically what we should be expecting during relatively good economic times for younger workers,"" he added.

'NEETS' feel 'left out and left behind'

Still, some young adults in the U.S. are neither working nor learning new skills. In 2023, about 11.2% of young adults ages 15 to 24 in the U.S. were considered as NEETs, according to the International Labour Organization. In other words, roughly one in 10 young people are ""being left out and left behind in many ways,"" Bustamante said. Even though ""that's typically the norm,"" he said, ""we should be expecting these rates to be lower."" More from Personal Finance:

The 'funflation' effect: Why consumers are spending this summer Young men, especially, are increasingly disengaged, according to Julia Pollak, a labor economist at ZipRecruiter. ""The NEET trend is mostly a male phenomenon,"" she said. Pollak explained that's in part due to declining opportunities in traditionally male occupations, such as construction and manufacturing, while ""women's enrollment in schooling, education outcomes, and employment outcomes have mostly trended upwards.""

'Talent hoarding' has led to 'new unemployables'

According to Korn Ferry's report, a ""perfect storm"" has also created a glut of ""new unemployables,"" or highly trained workers who struggle to find job opportunities. ""Employers are holding on to the talent they have and increasingly focusing on talent mobility,"" said David Ellis, senior vice president for global talent acquisition transformation at Korn Ferry. This ""talent hoarding"" has led to fewer available job openings even for well-qualified candidates, he said.

At the same time, firms are scaling back on new hires, limiting the opportunities at the entry level, as well. While the teen employment rate is the highest it has been in over a decade, early 20-somethings are struggling to find jobs, Pollak said. ""It's the 20- to 24-year-olds that saw a massive drop off in the labor force participation during the pandemic, and who have lagged behind ever since."" Overall, hiring projections for the class of 2024 fell 5.8% from last year, according to a report from the National Association of Colleges and Employers, or NACE. As more candidates compete for fewer positions, stretches of unemployment are also lengthening. Now, the number of people unemployed for longer than six months is up 21%, Korn Ferry found.

Farmers can lease their land to solar energy developers, diversifying their income streams while maintaining agricultural activities on the remaining areas. This symbiotic relationship supports sustainable development by reducing greenhouse gas emissions and promoting renewable energy adoption.

Google will partner with BlackRock to develop a 1-gigawatt pipeline of new solar capacity in Taiwan, the U.S. tech giant announced Monday in a press release as it seeks to boost energy capacity and cut carbon emissions amid the artificial intelligence boom.

The deal will see Google make a capital investment, yet to be approved by regulators, in Taiwanese solar developer New Green Power ""to facilitate the buildout of its large-scale solar pipeline.""

Google did not reveal how much it was investing into New Green Power, a BlackRock portfolio firm.

The investment will boost clean energy on Taiwan's local electricity grid and help Google reach its goal of achieving net-zero emissions across all its operations and value chain by 2030, the company said.

The new solar capacity will help power Google's data centers and cloud region in Taiwan, the press release said. Some of the clean energy capacity will also be offered to Google's chip suppliers and manufacturers in the region, it said.

""We expect to procure up to 300 [megawatts] of solar energy from this pipeline through power purchase agreements (PPAs) and the associated energy attribute certificates (Taiwan Renewable Energy Certificates or T-RECS) to help meet electricity demand from our data center campus, cloud region and office operations in Taiwan,"" Amanda Peterson Corio, global head of data center energy at Google, said in a blog post on Monday.

Taiwan produces nearly 60% of the world's semiconductor chips and accounts for an even bigger share of advanced AI processors, according to global consulting firm EY. Chip fabrication facilities are among the most energy-intensive facilities in the world as chip manufacturing is a long and complex process.","The aerial view reveals the mutual benefits of combining solar energy production and agricultural land use.

In an exclusive interview with CNBC, Nikolay Storonsky, Revolut's CEO and co-founder, said that the company is feeling confident about securing its British bank license, after overcoming some key hurdles in its more than three-year-long journey toward gaining approval from regulators.

""Hopefully, sooner or later, we'll get it,"" Storonsky told CNBC via video call. Regulators are ""still working on it,"" he added, but so far haven't raised any outstanding concerns with the fintech.

Storonsky noted that Revolut's huge size has meant that it's taken longer for the company to get its banking license approved than would have been the case for smaller companies. Several small financial institutions have been able to win approval for a banking license with few customers, he added.

""U.K. banking licenses are being approved for smaller companies,"" Storonsky said. ""They usually approve someone twice every year,"" and they typically tend to be smaller institutions. ""Of course, we are very large, so it takes extra time.""

Revolut is a licensed electronic money institution, or EMI, in the U.K. But it can't yet offer lending products such as credit cards, personal loans, or mortgages. A bank license would enable it to offer loans in the U.K. The firm has faced lengthy delays to its application, which it filed in 2021.

One key issue the company faced was with its share structure being inconsistent with the rulebook of the Prudential Regulation Authority, which is the regulatory body for the financial services industry that sits under the Bank of England.

Revolut has multiple classes of shares and some of those share classes previously had preferential rights attached. One conditions set by the Bank of England for granting Revolut its U.K. banking license, was to collapse its six classes of shares into ordinary shares.

Revolut has since resolved this, with the company striking a deal with Japanese tech investor SoftBank to transfer its shares in the firm to a unified class, relinquishing preferential rights, according to a person familiar with the matter. News of the resolution with SoftBank was first reported by the Financial Times.","LONDON — The boss of British financial technology giant Revolut told CNBC he is optimistic about the company's chances of being granted a U.K. banking license, as a jump in users saw the firm report record full-year pre-tax profits.

CNBC,https://www.cnbc.com/2024/07/01/ken-griffin-says-hes-not-convinced-ai-will-replace-human-jobs-in-near-future.html,2024-07-01,19:43:08 UTC,Citadel’s Ken Griffin says he's not convinced that AI will replace human jobs in the near future,"Ken Griffin, founder and CEO of Citadel, said he remains skeptical that artificial intelligence could soon make human jobs obsolete as he sees flaws in machine learning models applied in certain scenarios.

""We are at what is widely viewed as a real inflection point in the evolution of technology, with the rise of large language models. Some are convinced that within three years almost everything we do as humans will be done in one form or another by LLMs and other AI tools,"" Griffin said Friday during an event for Citadel's new class of interns in New York. ""For a number of reasons, I am not convinced that these models will achieve that type of breakthrough in the near future.""

The rapid rise of AI has had the world pondering its far-reaching impact on society, including technology-induced job cuts. Elon Musk, CEO of Tesla, is among many who have repeatedly warned of the threats that AI poses to humanity. He has called AI ""more dangerous"" than nuclear weapons, saying there will come a point where ""no job is needed.""

Griffin, whose hedge fund and electronic market maker have been at the forefront of automation, said machine-learning tools do have their limits when it comes to adapting to changes.

""Machine learning models do not do well in a world where regimes shift. Self-driving cars don't work very well in the North due to snow. When the terrain changes, they have no idea what to do,"" Griffin said. ""Machine learning models do much better when there's consistency.""

Still, the billionaire investor thinks the power of advanced technology can't be dismissed in the long term, and he even sees cancer being eradicated one day because of it.

""The rise of computing power is allowing us to solve all kinds of problems that were just simply not solvable five, 10, 15 years ago,"" Griffin said. ""This is going to radically transform healthcare. We will end cancer as you know it in your lifetime.""

Citadel has long placed a great emphasis on hiring, not hesitant about putting responsibility into the hands of young employees and even interns, the CEO said.

The firm's internship program has become one of the most competitive in the country. More than 85,000 students applied for about 300 positions this year, reflecting an acceptance rate of less than 0.5%, which is lower than that of Harvard University and the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.

""The people we hire today are going to be the leaders of Citadel not in 30 or 40 years, but in just a few years,"" Griffin said.","Ken Griffin, founder and CEO of Citadel, said he remains skeptical that artificial intelligence could soon make human jobs obsolete as he sees flaws in machine learning models applied in certain scenarios.

The U.S. stock market has become dominated by about a handful of companies in recent years. Some experts question whether that ""concentrated"" market puts investors at risk, though others think such fears are likely overblown. Let's look at the S&P 500 , the most popular benchmark for U.S. stocks, as an illustration of the dynamics at play. The top 10 stocks in the S&P 500, the largest by market capitalization, accounted for 27% of the index at the end of 2023, nearly double the 14% share a decade earlier, according to a recent Morgan Stanley analysis.

In other words, for every $100 invested in the index, about $27 was funneled to the stocks of just 10 companies, up from $14 a decade ago. That rate of increase in concentration is the most rapid since 1950, according to Morgan Stanley. It has increased more in 2024: The top 10 stocks accounted for 37% of the index as of June 24, according to FactSet data. The so-called ""Magnificent Seven"" — Apple , Amazon , Alphabet , Meta , Microsoft , Nvidia and Tesla — make up about 31% of the index, it said.

'A bit riskier than people realize'

Some experts fear the largest U.S. companies are having an outsized influence on investors' portfolios. For example, the Magnificent Seven stocks accounted for more than half the S&P 500's gain in 2023, according to Morgan Stanley. Just as those stocks helped push up overall returns, a downturn in one or many of them could put a lot of investor money in jeopardy, some said. For example, Nvidia shed more than $500 billion in market value after a recent three-day sell-off in June, dragging down the S&P 500 into a multiday losing streak. (The stock has since recovered a bit.) The S&P 500's concentration ""is a bit riskier than people realize,"" said Charlie Fitzgerald III, a certified financial planner based in Orlando, Florida. ""Nearly a third of [the S&P 500] is sitting in seven stocks,"" he said. ""You're not diversifying when you're concentrating like this.""

Why stock concentration may not be a concern

The S&P 500 tracks stock prices of the 500 largest publicly traded companies. It does so by market capitalization: The larger a firm's stock valuation, the larger its weighting in the index. Tech-stock euphoria has helped drive higher concentration at the top, particularly among the Magnificent Seven. Collectively, Magnificent Seven stocks are up about 57% in the past year, as of market close on June 27 — more than double the 25% return of the whole S&P 500. Chip maker Nvidia's stock alone has tripled in that time. More from Personal Finance:

Retirement 'super savers' have the biggest 401(k) balances

Households have seen their buying power grow Despite the sharp increase in stock concentration, some market experts believe the concern may be overblown. For one, many investors are diversified beyond the U.S. stock market. It's ""rare"" for 401(k) investors to own just a U.S. stock fund, for example, according to a recent analysis by John Rekenthaler, vice president of research at Morningstar. Many invest in target-date funds. A Vanguard TDF for near-retirees has a roughly 8% weighting to the Magnificent Seven, while one for younger investors who aim to retire in about three decades has a 13.5% weighting, Rekenthaler wrote in May.

There's precedent for this market concentration

Additionally, the current concentration isn't unprecedented by historical or global standards, according to the Morgan Stanley analysis. Research by finance professors Elroy Dimson, Paul Marsh and Mike Staunton shows that the top 10 stocks made up about 30% of the U.S. stock market in the 1930s and early 1960s, and about 38% in 1900.

The stock market was as concentrated (or more) around the late 1950s and early '60s, for example, a period when ""stocks did just fine,"" said Rekenthaler, whose research examines markets since 1958. ""We've been here before,"" he said. ""And when we were here before, it wasn't particularly bad news."" When there were big market crashes, they generally don't appear to have been associated with stock concentration, he added. When compared with the world's dozen largest stock markets, the U.S. market was the fourth-most-diversified at the end of 2023 — better than that of Switzerland, France, Australia, Germany, South Korea, the United Kingdom, Taiwan and Canada, Morgan Stanley said.

'Sometimes you can be surprised'

Big U.S. companies also generally seem to have the profits to back up their current lofty valuations, unlike during the peak of the dot-com bubble of the late 1990s and early 2000s, experts said. Present-day market leaders ""generally have higher profit margins and returns on equity"" than those in 2000, according to a recent Goldman Sachs Research report. The Magnificent Seven ""are not pie-in-the-sky"" companies: They're generating ""tremendous"" revenue for investors, said Fitzgerald, principal and founding member of Moisand Fitzgerald Tamayo. ""How much more gain can be made is the question,"" he added.

VettaFi's Todd Rosenbluth thinks value stocks, which have been market laggards, could get a lift from one of the biggest Wall Street events of the year: the FTSE Russell's annual rebalancing.

""It's worth paying attention to value,"" the firm's head of research told CNBC's ""ETF Edge"" this week. ""It feels like … [for a] long time that growth has outperformed value.""

On Friday, the Russell indexes underwent their annual reconstitution to reflect changes in the market as companies grow and shift. The iShares Russell 1000 Growth ETF is up 20% so far this year, while the iShares Russell 1000 Value ETF is up almost 6%.

""We do think there's a place for both growth and value within a broader portfolio — just people are skewed more toward growth heading into the second half of the year,"" he added. ""There have been periods when the pendulum has swung back in favor of value.""

FTSE Russell CEO Fiona Bassett said on ""ETF Edge"" the indices are built to reflect the nature of the market.

""One of the benefits of the Russell franchise generally is our ability to provide different sleeves of exposure,"" she said. ""So, for those people who want to get concentrated exposure to value or to growth, we have the indices available to do that.""

JPMorgan Chase and Morgan Stanley said Friday that they were boosting both dividend payouts and share repurchases, while rivals Citigroup and Bank of America made more modest announcements.

JPMorgan, the biggest U.S. bank by assets, said it was raising its quarterly dividend 8.7% to $1.25 per share and that it authorized a new $30 billion share repurchase program.

Morgan Stanley, a dominant player in wealth management, said it was boosting its dividend 8.8% to 92.5 cents per share and authorized a $20 billion repurchase plan.

Citigroup said it was raising its dividend 5.7% to 56 cents per share and that it would ""continue to assess share repurchases"" on a quarterly basis.

Bank of America said it was increasing its dividend 8% to 26 cents per share. Its release made no mention of share repurchases.

The big banks announced their plans to boost capital return to shareholders after passing the annual stress test administered by the Federal Reserve this week. While all 31 banks in this year's exam showed regulators they could withstand a severe hypothetical recession, JPMorgan said Wednesday that it could have higher losses than the Fed initially found.

Still, that would not affect its capital-return plan, the New York-based bank said Friday.

""The strength of our company allows us to continually invest in building our businesses for the future, pay a sustainable dividend, and return any remaining excess capital to our shareholders as we see fit,"" JPMorgan CEO Jamie Dimon said in his company's release.

Warren Buffett on Friday made his biggest annual donation to date, giving $5.3 billion worth of Berkshire Hathaway shares to five charities.

The legendary investor, who's turning 94 in August, converted 8,674 of his Berkshire Class A shares to donate more than 13 million Class B shares, according to a statement Friday. A total of 9.93 million shares went to the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation, with the rest going to the Susan Thompson Buffett Foundation, named for his late first wife, and the three charities led by his children Howard, Susan and Peter Buffett.

The ""Oracle of Omaha"" has pledged to give away the fortune he built at Berkshire, the Omaha, Nebraska-based conglomerate he started running in 1965. Buffett has been making annual donations to the five charities since 2006.

After Friday's donations, Buffett owns 207,963 Berkshire A shares and 2,586 B shares, worth about $130 billion.

New charitable trust

In an interview with The Wall Street Journal, Buffett clarified that after his death, the enormous fortune he amassed from building the one-of-a-kind conglomerate will be directed to a new charitable trust overseen by his three children.

""It should be used to help the people that haven't been as lucky as we have been,"" he told the Journal. ""There's eight billion people in the world, and me and my kids, we've been in the luckiest 100th of 1% or something. There's lots of ways to help people.""

Buffett has previously said his three children are the executors of his will as well as the named trustees of the charitable trust that will receive 99%-plus of his wealth.

He told the Journal that the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation will no longer receive donations after his death. Buffett resigned as a trustee at the Gates Foundation in June 2021 in the midst of Bill and Melinda Gates' divorce.

At Berkshire's annual meeting in May, Buffett spoke candidly to shareholders about a future when he's no longer at the helm, appearing solemn at times as he pondered his advanced age and reflected on his late friend and business partner Charlie Munger.

Greg Abel, vice chairman for noninsurance operations at Berkshire, has been named Buffett's successor and has taken on most of the responsibility at the conglomerate.

Buffett previously said his will will be made public after his death.

""After my death, the disposition of my assets will be an open book – no 'imaginative' trusts or foreign entities to avoid public scrutiny but rather a simple will available for inspection at the Douglas County Courthouse,"" Buffett said in November.","Warren Buffett speaks during the Berkshire Hathaway Annual Shareholders Meeting in Omaha, Nebraska on May 4, 2024.

CNBC,https://www.cnbc.com/2024/06/28/apples-vision-pro-starts-deliveries-at-a-higher-price-in-china-than-in-the-us.html,2024-06-28,15:25:25 UTC,Apple's Vision Pro starts deliveries at a higher price in China than in the U.S.,"The Apple Vision Pro mixed-reality headset is on sale at the Apple flagship store in Hangzhou, Zhejiang Province of China, on June 28, 2024.

HANGZHOU, China — Apple 's mixed-reality headset began deliveries in China on Friday with a retail price roughly 18% higher than in the U.S.

The device starts at 29,999 yuan, or $4,128, in China, compared to a $3,500 retail price in the U.S.

When asked by CNBC, a customer surnamed Chen in Beijing said his suggestion to Apple CEO Tim Cook was to make Vision Pro cheaper by about 10,000 yuan, or $1,376. The customer, who did not share his first name due to concerns about speaking with foreign media, said many people in China might prefer to buy a secondhand Vision Pro because of the discounted price that typically comes with purchases from sellers unaffiliated with Apple.

Many of the most popular posts about the device on Chinese social media platform Weibo on Friday focused on the hashtag ""is it worth paying for the China version of Vision Pro,"" according to a CNBC translation.

CNBC has reached out to Apple for comment.

Greater China accounted for about 18% of Apple's revenue in the three months that ended March 30, according to an Apple filing.

Over the past year, Apple has faced growing competition from Huawei devices and other domestic brands, amid greater attention on national security.

Chen preordered his Vision Pro and was at a major store in Beijing to pick it up and receive some training on how to use it.

Store salespeople told CNBC that all of Friday's half-hour training sessions for preorders of the Vision Pro were booked up at Apple stores in Beijing — from 8 a.m. to 10 p.m.

Chinese companies such as Tencent, Alibaba and JD.com have launched Vision Pro versions of their apps for shopping, playing games and watching videos.","The Apple Vision Pro mixed-reality headset is on sale at the Apple flagship store in Hangzhou, Zhejiang Province of China, on June 28, 2024.

Honor

HANGZHOU, China — The transforming power of artificial intelligence is of no value unless user data is protected, CEO of Chinese smartphone company Honor, George Zhao, told CNBC in an exclusive interview on Thursday. His comments come as Apple this month announced it will start rolling out personalized AI tools on certain devices in the U.S. this fall. Honor already integrates some AI functions, such as enabling users to open text messages and other notifications just by looking at them, or eliminating copy-paste steps by directly linking Yelp-like apps to navigation or ride-hailing apps. This week at Mobile World Congress in Shanghai, Honor unveiled new AI tools for detecting the use of deepfakes in videos, and for simulating lenses that can decrease myopia during long hours of screen usage. Zhao emphasized that Honor's approach is to keep AI operations involving personal data limited to the smartphone. It's also known as on-device AI, and stands in contrast with AI tools that tap cloud computing to operate.

""Without data security and user privacy protection, AI will become worthless,"" Zhao said in Mandarin, translated by CNBC. ""This has always been one of our value propositions."" ""We say user data doesn't leave [the device],"" Zhao said. ""This is a principle we adhere to."" Apple Intelligence, the iPhone company's AI product, claims that it uses on-device processing and draws on ""server-based models"" for more complex requests. Apple said its new ""Private Cloud Compute"" never stores user data. Honor says its on-device AI is self-developed, and the company is working with Baidu and Google Cloud for some other AI features. ""Overall, my view is that AI's development to date has two directions,"" Zhao said. ""Network [cloud] AI has become more and more powerful. But I believe on-device AI, in its capabilities and empowerment of consumers, will become more and more intimate, more and more understanding."" ""It will give consumers more support and help them interact with the future AI world,"" he added.

Zhao pointed out that many generative AI applications, such as from OpenAI's ChatGPT, require large amounts of computing power well beyond the battery capability of a single smartphone. That means they need to use the cloud, which raises questions about the security of data transfer. Balancing AI capabilities with energy usage and data privacy is a ""huge challenge"" for manufacturers, Zhao said. He said a system collecting lots of user data to deliver more personalized features becomes a ""stronger"" object compared to the individual using the system. ""In the future development of smartphones, our goal is that the individual becomes stronger,"" Zhao said. ""When an object becomes stronger, this will reveal the smallness of the individual in its presence. I believe mobile end devices need to empower and enable individuals.""

The U.S. is the only G20 economy to see growth above pre-pandemic levels, and ""robust"" growth indicates ongoing upside risks to inflation, the 190-country agency said.

""We do recognize important upside risks,"" IMF Managing Director Kristalina Georgieva said at a press briefing on Thursday. ""Given those risks, we agree that the Fed should keep policy rates at current levels until at least late 2024."" The Fed's current fed funds rate has stood within the range of 5.25% to 5.50% since July 2023.

The IMF, often called the world's ""lender of last resort,"" forecasts that the core personal consumption expenditures price index — the Fed's preferred measure of inflation — will end 2024 at around 2.5% and reach the Fed's 2% target rate by mid-2025, ahead of the Fed's own projection for 2026.

U.S. economic strength during the Fed's rate-hike cycle was aided by labor supply and productivity gains, Georgieva said, while highlighting the need for ""clear evidence"" that inflation is coming down to the 2% target before the Fed cuts rates.

Nonetheless, the IMF's ""more optimistic"" assessment of the downward inflation trajectory is based on indications of a cooling labor market in the U.S. and weakening consumer demand.

""I want to recognize that a lesson we learned from the last [few] years is we are at a time of more uncertainty. This uncertainty also lies ahead. We are confident, however, that the Fed will move through that, and certainly with the same prudence it has demonstrated over the last year,"" Georgieva said.

Roaring Kitty, whose legal name is Keith Gill, has stirred up trading in speculative names such as GameStop by posting cryptic images and memes online. A picture of a cartoon dog appeared on his X feed Thursday afternoon, briefly driving up Chewy shares as much as 34% to $39.10. The stock later fell into negative territory again in Thursday's session, closing the day down 0.3%.

Chewy shares rallied dramatically on Thursday after meme stock leader Roaring Kitty posted a picture on social media platform X that resembles the logo of the online pet food retailer, but the gains were quickly erased later in the session.

There's also a strong connection between meme stock GameStop and Chewy. GameStop CEO Ryan Cohen was the founder and CEO of Chewy, who was instrumental in PetSmart's takeover of Chewy in 2017 and its subsequent initial public offering in 2019.

Cohen joined the GameStop board of directors along with two other Chewy executives in January 2021, partly helping fuel the initial GameStop rally. He later took over as GameStop CEO in 2023, leading a turnaround in the brick-and-mortar video game retailer.

Shares in pet retailers such as Chewy and Petco saw big spikes during the pandemic when stuck-at-home consumers adopted cats and dogs in droves. With the adoptions came purchases of needed accessories such as new beds and leashes for their furry family members.

But as the pandemic ended and people began venturing outside again, adoption numbers slowed and consumers had less need for discretionary pet items such as toys and cages, which carry higher profit margins than pet food.

Over the past year or so, Chewy and Petco have seen consistently strong pet food sales, but revenue for higher margin categories has fallen.

Gill is a former marketer for Massachusetts Mutual Life Insurance. He came into the limelight after successfully encouraging retail investors to buy GameStop shares and call options in 2021 to squeeze out short-selling hedge funds. The mania in 2021 led to a series of congressional hearings featuring Gill in brokers' practices and the ""gamification"" of retail trading.","A picture of a cartoon dog appeared on his X feed Thursday afternoon, briefly driving up Chewy shares as much as 34% to $39.10.

CNBC,https://www.cnbc.com/2024/06/27/jpmorgan-chase-fed-stress-test-results-error.html,2024-06-27,14:34:23 UTC,JPMorgan Chase says its stress test losses should be higher than what the Fed disclosed,"JPMorgan Chase CEO and Chairman Jamie Dimon gestures as he speaks during the U.S. Senate Banking, Housing and Urban Affairs Committee oversight hearing on Wall Street firms, on Capitol Hill in Washington, D.C.

JPMorgan Chase said late Wednesday that the Federal Reserve overestimated a key measure of income in the giant bank's recent stress test, and that its losses under the exam should actually be higher than what the regulator found.

The bank took the unusual step of issuing a press release minutes before midnight ET to disclose its response to the Fed's findings.

JPMorgan said that the Fed's projections for a measure called ""other comprehensive income"" — which represents revenues, expenses and losses that are excluded from net income — ""appears to be too large.""

Under the Fed's table of projected revenue, income and losses though 2026, JPMorgan was assigned $13 billion in OCI, more than any of the 31 lenders in this year's test. It also estimated that the bank would face roughly $107 billion in loan, investment and trading losses in that scenario.

""Should the Firm's analysis be correct, the resulting stress losses would be modestly higher than those disclosed by the Federal Reserve,"" the bank said.

The error means that JPMorgan might require more time to finalize its share repurchase plan, according to a person with knowledge of the situation who declined to be identified speaking about the regulatory process. Banks were expected to begin disclosing those plans on Friday after the market closes.

The news is a wrinkle to the Federal Reserve's announcement Wednesday that all 31 of the banks in the annual exercise cleared the hurdle of being able to withstand a severe hypothetical recession, while maintaining adequate capital levels and the ability to lend to consumers and corporations.

Last year, Bank of America and Citigroup made similar disclosures, saying that estimates of their own future income differed from the Fed's results.

Banks have complained that aspects of the annual exam are opaque and that it's difficult to understand how the Fed produces some of its results.","The bank took the unusual step of issuing a press release minutes before midnight ET to disclose its response to the Fed's findings.

CNBC,https://www.cnbc.com/2024/06/26/fed-banks-stress-test-2024.html,2024-06-26,21:26:37 UTC,Federal Reserve says all 31 banks in annual stress test withstood a severe hypothetical downturn,"Federal Reserve Board Vice Chair for Supervision Michael Barr testifies before a House Financial Services Committee hearing on the response to the bank failures of Silicon Valley Bank and Signature Bank, on Capitol Hill in Washington, D.C., on March 29, 2023.

The Federal Reserve said Wednesday that the biggest banks operating in the U.S. would be able to withstand a severe recession scenario while maintaining their ability to lend to consumers and corporations.

Each of the 31 banks in this year's regulatory exercise cleared the hurdle of being able to absorb losses while maintaining more than the minimum required capital levels, the Fed said in a statement.

The stress test assumed that unemployment surges to 10%, commercial real estate values plunge 40% and housing prices fall 36%.

""This year's results show that under our stress scenario, large banks would take nearly $685 billion in total hypothetical losses, yet still have considerably more capital than their minimum common equity requirements,"" said Michael Barr, the Fed's vice chair for supervision. ""This is good news and underscores the usefulness of the extra capital that banks have built in recent years.""

The Fed's stress test is an annual ritual that forces banks to maintain adequate cushions for bad loans and dictates the size of share repurchases and dividends. This year's version included giants such as JPMorgan Chase and Goldman Sachs , credit card companies including American Express and regional lenders such as Truist .

While no bank appeared to get badly tripped up by this year's exercise, which had roughly the same assumptions as the 2023 test, the group's aggregate capital levels fell 2.8 percentage points, which was worse than last year's decline.

That is because the industry is holding more consumer credit card loans and more corporate bonds that have been downgraded. Lending margins have also been squeezed compared to last year, according to the Fed.

""While banks are well-positioned to withstand the specific hypothetical recession we tested them against, the stress test also confirmed that there are some areas to watch,"" Barr said. ""The financial system and its risks are always evolving, and we learned in the Great Recession the cost of failing to acknowledge shifting risks.""

The Fed also performed what it called an ""exploratory analysis"" of funding stresses and a trading meltdown that applied to only the eight biggest banks.

In this exercise, the companies appeared to avoid disaster, despite a sudden surge in the cost of deposits combined with a recession. In a scenario where five large hedge funds implode, the big banks would lose between $70 billion and $85 billion.

""The results demonstrated that these banks have material exposure to hedge funds but that they can withstand different types of trading book shocks,"" the Fed said.

Banks are expected to begin announcing their latest share repurchase plans on Friday.","The Federal Reserve said Wednesday that the biggest banks operating in the U.S. would be able to withstand a severe recession scenario while maintaining their ability to lend to consumers and corporations.

Morgan Stanley is pushing further into its adoption of artificial intelligence with a new assistant that is expected to take over thousands of hours of labor for the bank's financial advisors. The assistant, called Debrief, keeps detailed logs of advisors' meetings and automatically creates draft emails and summaries of the discussions, bank executives told CNBC. Morgan Stanley plans to release the program to the firm's roughly 15,000 advisors by early July, marking one of the most significant steps yet for the use of generative AI at a major Wall Street bank. While the company's earlier efforts involved creating a ChatGPT-like service to help advisors navigate the firm's reams of research, Debrief brings AI into direct contact with advisors' most prized resource: their relationships with rich clients. The program, built using OpenAI's GPT-4, essentially sits in on client Zoom meetings, replacing the note-taking that advisors or junior employees have been doing by hand, according to Jeff McMillan, Morgan Stanley's head of firmwide artificial intelligence. ""What we're finding is that the quality and depth of the notes are just significantly better,"" McMillan told CNBC. ""The truth is, this does a better job of taking notes than the average human.""

Consent required

Importantly, clients must consent to being recorded each time Debrief is used. Future versions will allow advisors to use the program on corporate devices during in-person meetings, said McMillan. The rollout will serve as a real-world test for the vaunted productivity gains of generative AI, which took Wall Street by storm in recent months and has bolstered the value of chipmakers, tech giants and the broader U.S. stock market. Morgan Stanley's wealth management division hosts about 1 million Zoom calls a year, the bank told CNBC. While estimates vary, one Morgan Stanley advisor involved in the Debrief pilot said the program saves 30 minutes of work per meeting; advisors typically spend time after meetings creating notes and action plans to address client needs.

""As a financial adviser I'm doing four, five or six meetings a day,"" said Don Whitehead, a Houston-based advisor who's been testing the software. By ""having the note-taking service built in through AI, you can really be invested in the meeting, you're actually a lot more present."" It remains to be seen what advisors will do with the hours reclaimed from essential grunt work. In a sense, Morgan Stanley's projects in generative AI amount to a ""grand experiment in productivity,"" said McMillan. If, as McMillan and others believe, advisors will spend more time serving clients and prospecting for new ones, the technology should boost Morgan Stanley's growth in assets under management, as well as retention of clients and advisors. Morgan Stanley's wealth management division is one of the world's largest with $5.5 trillion in client assets as of March; the firm wants to reach $10 trillion. It will take at least a year to determine whether the technology is boosting advisor productivity, McMillan said. ""I'm the analytics guy, but the advisors will tell you that they're at their best when they're engaging"" with clients, said McMillan. ""None of them will tell you they love taking notes or looking at research reports, right? That's not why they got into this business.""

""I believe the governments [of China and the European Union] are now considering how, through negotiations, they can combine investment together with commodity trade,"" said Wan Gang, now president of the China Association for Science and Technology.

Wan was speaking via an official English translation during a livestream of a panel at the World Economic Forum's ""Summer Davos"" meeting in Dalian, China. Spokespersons for the European Commission were not immediately available when contacted by CNBC.

Regarding specifics, China's Ministry of Foreign Affairs referred CNBC to the Chinese authorities ""in charge,"" according to a CNBC translation of the Chinese. The ministry said China and the EU are each other's most important trade and investment partners, and that China hoped the EU would keep its trade and investment markets open.

China's Ministry of Commerce did not immediately respond to a request for comment outside of business hours on Thursday. The Commerce Ministry's spokesperson told reporters earlier in the day that the Chinese and European working groups remain in close consultations.

The Commerce Ministry had said over the weekend that it was launching consultations with the EU over the bloc's probe into the role of subsidies in Chinese electric cars. The EU said earlier this month that it would increase tariffs on imports of the vehicles.

""Even though we are not exporting a large number of EVs, perhaps the Chinese companies can try investing in Europe,"" Wan said, noting that such funding could create local jobs.","HEFEI, China — The man who spearheaded China's electric car strategy said Wednesday that Chinese investment in the European electric vehicles industry could be a way forward for both sides amid trade tensions.

But Americans need to do more","How's your 401(k) looking? A new report shows Americans are saving more, but probably need to do even more.

Vanguard has released its annual report, How America Saves 2024. Vanguard and Fidelity are the two biggest sponsors of 401(k) plans, and this is a snapshot of what nearly five million participants are doing with their money.

The good news: stock market returns are up and, thanks largely to automatic enrollment plans, investors are saving more than they did in the past.

The bad news: account balances for the median 401(k) of a person approaching retirement (65+) remains very low.

The takeaway: Americans are still very reliant on Social Security for a large chunk of their retirement.

Higher returns, participation rates, savings rates

Why do we care so much about 401(k) plans? Because it's the main private savings vehicle Americans have for retirement. More than 100 million Americans are covered by these ""defined contribution"" plans, with more than $10 trillion in assets.

First, 2023 was a good year to be an investor. The average total return rate for participants was 18.1%, the best year since 2019.

But to be effective vehicles for retirement, these plans need to: 1) have high participation rates, and 2) hold high levels of savings.

On those fronts, there is good news. John James, managing director of Vanguard's Institutional Investor Group, called it ""a year of progress.""

Plan participation reached all-time highs. Thanks to a change in the law several years ago, a record-high 59% of plans offered automatic enrollment in 401(k) plans. This is a major improvement: ipreviously, enrollment in 401(k) plans were often short of expectations because investors had to ""opt-in,"" that is they had to choose to participate in the plan. Because of indecision or simple ignorance, many did not. By switching to automatic enrollment, participants were automatically enrolled and had to ""opt-out"" if they did not want to participate.

The result: enrollment rates have gone up. Plans with automatic enrollment had a 94% participation rate, compared with 67% for voluntary enrollment plans.

Participant saving rates reached all time highs. The average participant deferred 7.4% of their savings. Including employee and employer contributions, the average total participant contribution rate was 11.7%.

A few other observations about Vanguard's 401(k) plan investors:

They prefer equities and target date funds. They love equities over bonds or any other investments. The average plan contribution to equities is 74%. A record-high 64% of all 2023 contributions went into target-date funds, which automatically adjust stock and bond allocations as the participant ages.

They don't trade much. In 2023, only 5% of nonadvised participants traded within their accounts; 95% did no trading at all. ""Over the past 15 years, we have generally observed a decline in participant trading,"" Vanguard said, which it partially attributed to increased adoption of target-date funds.

Despite gains in the market, account balances are still low

In 2023, the average account balance for Vanguard participants was $134,128, but the median balance (half had more, half had less) was only $35,286.

Why such a big difference between the average and the median? Because a small group of investors with large balances pull up the averages. Forty percent of participants had less than $20,000 in their retirement accounts.

Median balances for those near retirement are still low

A different way to look at the problem is to ask how much people who are retirement age have saved, because it's an indication of how prepared they are for imminent retirement.

Investors 65 years or older had an average account balance of $272,588, but a median balance of only $88,488.

A median balance of $88,488 is not much when you consider older participants have higher incomes and higher savings rates. That is not much money for a 65-year old nearing retirement.

Of course, these balances don't necessarily reflect total lifetime savings. Some have more than one retirement plan because they had other plans with previous employers. Most do have other sources of retirement savings, typically Social Security. A shrinking number may also have a pension. Some may have money in checking accounts, or have stocks or bonds outside a retirement account.

Regardless, the math does not look great

So let's do some retirement math.

A typical annual drawdown for a 401(k) account in retirement is about 4%. Drawing down 4% of $88,488 a year gets you $3,539 every 12 months.

Next, Social Security. As of January 2023, the average Social Security benefit was almost $1,689 per month, or about $20,268 per year.

Finally, even though pensions are a vanishing benefit, let's include them.

According to the Pension Rights Center, the median annual pension benefit for a private pension is $9,262 (government employees have higher benefits).

Here's our yearly retirement budget:

Personal savings $3,539

Pension $9,262

Social Security $20,264

Total: $33,065

It's certainly possibly to live on $33,000 a year, but this would likely only work if you own your home, have low expenses and live in a low-cost part of the country.

Even then, it would hardly be a robust retirement.

And these are the lucky ones. Only 57% of retirees have a tax-deferred retirement account like a 401(k) or IRA. Only 56% reported receiving income from a pension.

And that extra income largely determines whether a retiree feels good or bad about their retirement.

In 2023, four out five retirees said they were doing at least okay financially, but this varied tremendously depending on whether retirees had sources of income outside of Social Security. Only 52% of retirees who did not have private income said they were doing at least okay financially.

What can be done?

To have a more robust retirement, Americans are just going to have to save more.

One issue is investors still don't contribute the maximum amount allowed. Only 14% of participants saved the statutory maximum amount of $22,500 per year ($30,000 for those age 50 or older). The likely reason: most felt they couldn't afford to.

However, only 53% of even those with income over $150,000 contributed the maximum allowed. Given that the employee match is ""free money,"" one would think participants in that income bracket would rationally choose to max out their contribution. The fact that many still don't suggests that more investor education is needed.

Regardless, it's very dangerous to assume that retirees are going to be bailed out by an ever-rising stock market. Another year anywhere near 2022, when the S&P 500 was down 20%, and investor confidence in their financial future will likely deteriorate.","The bad news: account balances for the median 401(k) of a person approaching retirement (65+) remains very low.

Patrick Van Katwijk | Getty Images

AMSTERDAM — Europe is at risk of falling behind the U.S. and China on artificial intelligence as it focuses on regulating the technology, according to Prince Constantijn of the Netherlands. ""Our ambition seems to be limited to being good regulators,"" Constantijn told CNBC in an interview on the sidelines of the Money 20/20 fintech conference in Amsterdam earlier this month. Prince Constantijn is the third and youngest son of former Dutch Queen Beatrix and the younger brother of reigning Dutch King Willem-Alexander. He is special envoy of the Dutch startup accelerator Techleap, where he works to help local startups grow fast internationally by improving their access to capital, market, talent, and technologies. ""We've seen this in the data space [with GDPR], we've seen this now in the platform space, and now with the AI space,"" Constantijn added. European Union regulators have taken a tough approach to artificial intelligence, with formal regulations limiting how developers and companies can apply the technology in certain scenarios.

The bloc gave final approval to the EU AI Act, a ground-breaking AI law, last month. Officials are concerned by how quickly the technology is advancing and risks it poses around jobs displacement, privacy, and algorithmic bias. The law takes a risk-based approach to artificial intelligence, meaning that different applications of the tech are treated differently depending on their risk level. For generative AI applications, the EU AI Act sets out clear transparency requirements and copyright rules. All generative AI systems would have to make it possible to prevent illegal output, to disclose if content is produced by AI and to publish summaries of the copyrighted data used for training purposes. But the EU's Ai Act requires even stricter scrutiny for high-impact, general-purpose AI models that could pose ""systemic risk,"" such as OpenAI's GPT-4 — including thorough evaluations and compulsory reporting of any ""serious incidents."" Prince Constantijn said he's ""really concerned"" that the Europe's focus has been more on regulating AI than trying to become a leader innovating in the space. ""It's good to have guardrails. We want to bring clarity to the market, predictability and all that,"" he told CNBC earlier this month on the sidelines of Money 20/20. ""But it's very hard to do that in such a fast-moving space."" ""There are big risks in getting it wrong, and like we've seen in genetically modified organisms, it hasn't stopped the development. It just stopped Europe developing it, and now we are consumers of the product, rather than producers able to influence the market as it develops."" Between 1994 and 2004, the EU had imposed an effective moratorium on new approvals of genetically modified crops over perceived health risks associated with them.

The bloc subsequently developed strict rules for GMOs, citing a need to protect citizens' health and the environment. The U.S. National Academies of Sciences says that genetically modified crops are safe for both human consumption and the environment. Constantijn added that Europe is making it ""quite hard"" for itself to innovate in AI due to ""big restrictions on data,"" particularly when it comes to sectors like health and medical science. In addition, the U.S. market is ""a much bigger and unified market"" with more free-flowing capital, Constantijn said. On these points he added, ""Europe scores quite poorly."" ""Where we score well is, I think, on talent,"" he said. ""We score well on technology itself."" Plus, when it comes to developing applications that use AI, ""Europe is definitely going to be competitive,"" Constantijn noted. He nevertheless added that ""the underlying data infrastructure and IT infrastructure is something we'll keep depending on large platforms to provide.""","Prince Constantijn is special envoy to Techleap, a Dutch startup accelerator.

But top CEOs see more hurdles to clear,"A bank employee count China’s renminbi (RMB) or yuan notes next to U.S. dollar notes at a Kasikornbank in Bangkok, Thailand, January 26, 2023. Athit Perawongmetha | Reuters

DALIAN, China — For China's yuan to be used more globally, the currency needs more ""applications"" such as for stocks and bonds, Bonnie Chan, CEO of Hong Kong Exchanges and Clearing Limited, said on a panel Tuesday. Beijing has long touted its ambitions for increasing global use of the Chinese yuan — also known as the ""renminbi"" or ""RMB"" — in an international financial market where the U.S. dollar is the dominant currency. U.S. sanctions on Russia have also increased the pressure on some countries to have alternatives to the greenback. Chan, speaking during the World Economic Forum's ""Summer Davos"" meeting in Dalian, China, noted that people hold a currency for trade, or, more importantly, as a store of wealth. ""We're not just going to hold on to a bunch of RMB and put it into this bank account,"" she said. ""You want to have bonds, you want to have equities, etc."" ""One of our strategic imperatives [has] been changed to make sure that we continue to produce more RMB-denominated security products,"" Chan said, ""so that investors around the world can actually see more applications of the RMB and be able to use those as the medium to store wealth in the form of the RMB.""

Last year, the HKEX announced a ""Dual-Counter"" program that allows investors to trade Hong Kong-listed securities in Hong Kong dollars or Chinese yuan. In a significant step toward internationalization of the yuan, the International Monetary Fund in 2015 announced that it would add the yuan to its basket of reserve currencies the following year. The yuan was the fourth-most active currency for global payments by value in May, accounting for nearly 4.5% of such transactions, according to the interbank messaging network SWIFT. The U.S. dollar had a nearly 48% share. In trade finance, the yuan ranked third at about 5.1% in May, according to SWIFT. The euro was slightly higher at 5.6%, while the U.S. dollar dominated with a nearly 85% share, the data showed. Fred Hu, founder, chairman and CEO of Primavera Capital, said on the same panel Tuesday that the internationalization of the yuan is probably going to take longer than many expect, despite an increased amount of statements from Beijing. While China is the largest trading nation and has large financial centers, ""we're not as big, as deep as the U.S.,"" Hu said. ""Besides our capital account is also closed, it's not fully convertible, [which] also in some way [is] hampering the internationalization of the renminbi.""

A maturing financial market

Developing more Chinese yuan-denominated investment products also requires a maturation of the local financial sector. Part of that includes having a more sophisticated investor base. Chan said that during the annual Lujiazui Financial Forum in Shanghai last week, nearly every conversation with top leaders included the term ""patient investing."" The phrase has emerged in official releases to encourage long-term investing over short-term speculation. ""Patience comes from learning through the market volatility,"" Kenny Lam, CEO of Two Sigma Asia-Pacific, said during the same panel on Tuesday. He said that policymakers have been giving more thought to making their policies more stable and consistent.

The 2024 National Basketball Association champions are up for sale.

The Boston Celtics' ownership group announced Monday that it plans to sell the team, according to a statement posted to the Celtics' account on social media site X.

The controlling family of the ownership group, Boston Basketball Partners LLC, said it intends to sell all of its shares in the team ""for estate and family planning consideration.""

The sale of a majority stake is expected to be completed by the end of 2024 or early 2025, with the remainder of the sale closing in 2028, according to the statement.

As sports franchise valuations soar, the Celtics could fetch a particularly high price. The team is among the most successful and most widely followed in U.S. professional sports, and won its NBA record 18th championship last month.

This, plus the soaring cost of sports media rights, will likely lead to a valuation close to — if not more than — the record $4 billion price tag the NBA's Phoenix Suns received in 2023, sports consultants said Monday.","A ""Believe in Boston"" flag flies during the duck boat parade celebrating the Boston Celtics' 18th NBA championship.

Boeing said Monday that it will buy back its struggling fuselage maker Spirit AeroSystems in an all-stock deal that the plane maker has said will improve safety and quality control. It said it agreed to pay $37.25 a share in Boeing stock for Spirit, giving the plane supplier an equity value of $4.7 billion. Including Spirit's debt the deal has a transaction value of $8.3 billion Boeing said. Spirit's shares closed Friday at $32.87 a share, a market capitalization of about $3.8 billion. Boeing in March disclosed it was in talks to acquire the Wichita, Kansas-based company, weeks after a fuselage panel blew out midair from a nearly new Boeing 737 Max 9 on an Alaska Airlines flight, sparking a fresh crisis for Boeing. Spirit makes the fuselages for the 737 and other parts, including sections of Boeing's 787 Dreamliners. In 2005, Boeing spun off operations in Kansas and Oklahoma that became the present-day Spirit AeroSystems. Boeing accounted for about 70% of Spirit's revenue last year, while roughly a quarter came from making parts for Boeing's main rival, Airbus, according to a securities filing. Boeing CEO Dave Calhoun, who has said he will step down at the end of the year, on Monday said bringing Spirit in-house will ""fully align"" the companies' production systems and workforces.

""Among the many actions we're taking as a company, this is one of the most significant in demonstrating our unwavering commitment to strengthen quality and make certain that Boeing is the company the world needs it to be,"" Calhoun said in a message to employees. He said he expects the deal to close mid-2025, subject to approval by regulators, Spirit shareholders and the sale of Spirit's operations dedicated to Airbus planes. Spirit's CEO, Pat Shanahan, is considered a possible successor for Calhoun. Airbus, meanwhile, said Monday it has reached an agreement with Spirit so that the European aircraft manufacturer is compensated $559 million by Spirit to acquire its manufacturing lines dedicated to Airbus planes. Those include operations in Belfast, Northern Ireland, where the wings and mid-fuselage of the A220 are produced, A220 pylons in Wichita and A350 fuselage sections in North Carolina. Airbus will pay $1 for the assets.

U.S. prosecutors plan to seek a guilty plea from Boeing over a charge tied to two fatal crashes of 737 Max planes, attorneys for the victims' family members said Sunday, blasting a potential agreement as a ""sweetheart deal.""

Justice Department attorneys and victims' family members and their lawyers spoke for about two hours on Sunday, discussing the plan, lawyers said.

Boeing declined to comment, and it wasn't immediately clear if it would accept a plea deal. A guilty plea could complicate its ability to get government contracts. Boeing is a major defense contractor.

The Justice Department didn't immediately respond to a request for comment.

The DOJ said in May that it was reviewing whether Boeing violated a 2021 settlement that protected the company from federal charges tied to the 2018 and 2019 crashes of its best-selling 737 Max planes, which killed all 346 people on the two flights. Under that agreement, Boeing said it would pay $2.5 billion.

The DOJ revisited the agreement after a door panel blew out of a new 737 Max 9 midair during an Alaska Airlines flight in January, sparking a new safety and quality control crisis for one of the world's two suppliers of large commercial airplanes. The so-called deferred prosecution agreement was set to expire days before the door panel blew out.

Boeing admitted in 2021 that two of its pilots defrauded the Federal Aviation Administration by concealing its addition of a new flight-control system to the planes before they were flown commercially. That system was later implicated in the two crashes.

The plea deal would require Boeing to pay an additional fine of about $247 million and call for the installation of an outside monitor on Boeing, according to Paul Cassell, one of the lawyers. Cassell called the new deal a ""slap on the wrist.""","U.S. prosecutors plan to seek a guilty plea from Boeing over a charge tied to two fatal crashes of 737 Max planes, attorneys for the victims' family members said Sunday, blasting a potential agreement as a ""sweetheart deal.""

The animated feature has tallied $1.014 billion worldwide as of Sunday, making it the highest-grossing film of 2024 and the first film since Warner Bros.′ ""Barbie"" to top $1 billion at the global box office.

""On behalf of movie theatre owners across the country and around the world, we want to congratulate Disney's 'Inside Out 2' for grossing $1 billion faster than any animated movie in history,"" said Michael O'Leary, president and CEO of the National Association of Theatre Owners. ""The film's stunning global success once again illustrates that audiences the world over will respond to compelling, entertaining movies, and that they want to enjoy them on the big screen.""

The billion-dollar benchmark is a much-needed win for Disney's Pixar animation hub. A once prolifically successful studio, Pixar has suffered at the box office in the wake of the pandemic. Much of its difficulties have come, in part, because Disney opted to debut a handful of animated features directly on streaming service Disney+ during theatrical closures and even once cinemas had reopened.

As a result, before ""Inside Out 2,"" no Disney animated feature from Pixar or its Walt Disney Animation studio had generated more than $480 million at the global box office since 2019.

""Inside Out 2"" has also showcased how vital the family audience is to the box office. This underserved crowd accounted for more than 70% of those in attendance during the film's domestic debut, according to data from EntTelligence.

While this audience came out in droves for Universal's ""The Super Mario Bros. Movie,"" which generated more than $1.36 billion at the global box office, there was little for them to feast on until the recent releases of Sony's ""The Garfield Movie"" and Paramount's ""IF.""

""Inside Out 2"" also drove the coveted teen demographic to cinemas, with 14% of foot traffic coming from those aged 13 to 17. This younger generation has been largely absent from the market in recent years.

As the future of moviegoing, this group is particularly important to the industry. Getting them back to the big screen has become a top priority for studios and movie theater operators.

Next up for family and teens is Universal and Illumination's ""Despicable Me 4,"" due out in theaters during the July Fourth holiday weekend.

Pride month is winding down — and this year, the corporate world took a more cautious approach. June tends to bring a wave of rainbow-themed merchandise and affirming ads and social media posts from retailers and consumers brands, coinciding with parades and other events that celebrate the LGBTQ+ community. As the presidential election approaches, however, some companies have grown quieter about diversity, equity and inclusion efforts to avoid stepping into the culture wars or facing the blowback from conservative customers that Target and Bud Light did a year ago. The starkest example of that came late Thursday: Tractor Supply, a retailer that sells animal feed, cowboy boots and lawn supplies in rural parts of the country, said it is ending all spending tied to diversity and environmental causes. That includes no longer sponsoring Pride festivals, the statement said. The move, while an outlier in its magnitude, underscores how some companies that made inclusion commitments in recent years are treading cautiously. It is difficult to track how many companies shared supportive messages, donated to LGBTQ+ causes or sold rainbow-themed merchandise in June compared to previous years. According to Gravity Research, a Washington, D.C.-based reputational research firm, 45% of Fortune 100 companies had at least one social media post on LinkedIn or X explicitly related to Pride as of June 21 this year, compared with 51% last June. Gravity Research President Luke Hartig said the volatility of the presidential election and the two candidates' willingness to call out companies by name has also made companies less likely to go public about their stand. ""There's a little bit of like, 'keep our heads down while we go through this election,'"" he said. Tim Bennett, cofounder of Tribury Productions, a marketing company that specializes in reaching LGBTQ+ Americans, works with Fortune 500 companies, including recent projects with Procter & Gamble. He said more clients have taken ""a wait-and-see"" approach to marketing to LGBTQ+ consumers or decided to scatter efforts throughout the year instead of making a big splash in a single month. ""June this year has not been like the last five or six,"" Bennett said. That may not be a bad thing for LGBTQ+ initiatives and charities. Sarah Kate Ellis, CEO of nonprofit advocacy group GLAAD, said she's seeing more companies get involved with year-round philanthropy and activism in more meaningful ways. She also pointed to a survey by Gravity Research that found that 78% of companies did not plan to change their Pride strategy this year. Thirteen percent were unsure whether they'd make changes and 9% said they planned to revise their strategy. Gravity Research surveyed 45 corporate executives and Fortune 500 leaders across industries in April. ""The visibility of companies putting flags out and having product to celebrate our Pride and to mark a month that's really significant and important for our community is really important, and I don't want to ever devalue that,"" Ellis said. ""I do think, though, those companies must look inside and make sure that they have the policies and the HR practices that match their outward marketing."" Major companies are still writing checks for LGBTQ+ causes, too. A GLAAD spokesperson said Friday that the group has not seen donations or corporate support decline this Pride month, though it does not yet have a total tally. On Friday, when the Stonewall National Monument Visitor Center officially opened its doors to commemorate the New York City bar that was a catalyst in the LGBTQ+ rights movement, the event had major backing from the business community. Supporters included Google, Amazon, JPMorgan Chase and Booking.com. President Joe Biden also made an appearance and remarks at the monument's opening.

The Bud Light and Target effect

Consumer staples brands were the most likely to say they planned to shift their Pride month strategy this year, according to Gravity Research's survey. That may stem from the conservative boycotts of Target and Bud Light last year. Target has carried a Pride collection for over a decade. Yet last year, the big-box retailer removed some items and moved displays after employees faced threats. Boycotters targeted items for transgender shoppers, such as ""tuck-friendly"" swimsuits, and also criticized separate Pride merchandise for kids. Instead of putting Pride merchandise in all stores this year, Target only carried it in the locations that accounted for 90% of total Pride sales in 2022 and 2023. It also stopped selling any Pride apparel for kids. On the company's website and in those select stores, shoppers can find a wide variety of Pride-themed items. The volume of negative feedback to the Pride collection externally and internally is ""significantly lower"" this year than in 2023, according to a Target spokesperson. In a statement, Target said it is ""committed to supporting the LGBTQIA+ community during Pride Month and year-round"" and would participate in Pride events across the country and support LGBTQ+ groups, in addition to offering Pride products.

Anheuser-Busch InBev and other large beer brands, on the other hand, have backed away from public support of the LGBTQ+ community. Conservatives like singer Kid Rock and Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis called for a boycott of the beer and its parent company, Anheuser-Busch InBev, after Bud Light sent personalized cans of its beer to transgender influencer Dylan Mulvaney. The marketing campaign coincided with the March Madness college basketball tournament. Bud Light sales tumbled around 25%, and the brand lost its spot as the best-selling beer in the U.S., ceding the position it held for more than two decades to Constellation Brands' Modelo. AB InBev distanced itself from Mulvaney and fired Bud Light's vice president of marketing. In October, AB InBev CEO Michel Doukeris said the brand would focus its marketing more on events like sports games and concerts. It also returned as the official sponsor of the UFC. In recent months, some consumers have returned to Bud Light, as RBC Europe analysts estimate that the brand's U.S. volume is down only about 10% these days. For its part, Bud Light hasn't posted in support of Pride month on its Instagram or X pages this year. The boycott was unusually sticky for a few reasons, according to Neil Reid, a geography professor at the University of Toledo who researches the beer industry. Studies have shown that consumers' loyalty to top-selling beers may be more tied to the brand than the taste, Reid said. Right-wing news outlets like Fox News also devoted plenty of airtime to the controversy, stretching its duration and potentially reaching new consumers who missed the initial reaction. Plus, once Bud Light sales fell, retailers gave more shelf space to its rivals. ""You can look at this issue from a moral, ethical perspective or you can also look at it from a pure business perspective. Those two often don't result in the same strategy,"" Reid said.

CNBC,https://www.cnbc.com/2024/06/30/fathom-joint-venture-of-amc-regal-cinemark-makes-major-gains.html,2024-06-30,15:21:20 UTC,"Fathom, the company behind classic films at your local theater, is making major gains in moviegoing","At a time when the box office is starved for content and audiences seem pickier than ever, Fathom Events is posting record revenue gains.

For 20 years, the joint venture between AMC , Regal and Cinemark has been best known for bringing alternative content to the big screen in the form of classic Hollywood titles, live telecasts of theater and opera productions, concerts and even television series.

Most recently, it ventured into the specialty distribution space to deliver ""The Blind,"" ""The Chosen,"" ""Jesus Thirsts: The Miracle of the Eucharist"" and ""Waitress: the Musical"" to audiences. Still to come is ""Andrea Bocelli 30: The Celebration.""

In 2023, Fathom generated $100 million at the box office, a 116% increase over 2019 levels and its highest-grossing year ever. And that momentum has continued into 2024, as the company tallied $43 million in the first quarter, up nearly 140% compared to the $18 million it tallied in the year-earlier period.

Fathom's relationships with Hollywood's biggest studios and its cinematic reach — as the partnership of the industry's three biggest theater chains — has made it a formidable force at the box office. Its value proposition is twofold: It breathes new life into older films, and into theaters.

""Falling mostly under the event film banner, anniversary titles have truly come into vogue seemingly more so now than in years past with a particular emphasis given to these beloved older films,"" said Paul Dergarabedian, senior media analyst at Comscore. ""These anniversary re-releases are a win-win, providing joy to movie fans and notably additional revenues to movie theaters often decades after initial theatrical run.""

In post-pandemic times, Fathom has acted as a crutch for many smaller cinema operators, providing much-needed content for the big screen amid a drought caused by pandemic and strike-related production shutdowns.

Season 4 of ""The Chosen,"" a faith-based television show about the life of Jesus, generated $32 million at the box office for Fathom, around 75% of its first-quarter haul.

""'The Chosen' was through [Fathom], and it was huge for us,"" said Brock Bagby, president and chief content, programming and development officer at B&B Theatres. ""It gave us a lot of extra revenue in February and the beginning of March that we wouldn't have had.""

Fathom has also benefited from its anniversary titles and classic cinema showings. Each year, the company brings films back to theaters to celebrate milestone years alongside fan-favorite titles.

""We've seen that there's a growing segment in the box office, people that are interested in seeing older films on the big screen,"" said Jordan Hohman, vice president of project development at Phoenix Theatres. ""These audiences are getting to enjoy classic films, either for the first time or for the first time, in a new way. I think that that's valuable.""

This year, the company celebrated the 85th anniversaries of ""The Wizard of Oz"" and ""Gone with the Wind"" as well as the 35th anniversary of ""Steel Magnolias."" Still on the calendar is the 50th anniversary of ""Blazing Saddles,"" the 70th anniversary of Alfred Hitchcock's ""Rear Window,"" the 40th anniversary of ""Neverending Story"" and the 20th anniversary of ""Mean Girls.""

It also has a film series called Studio Ghibli Fest, which features 14 films from the studio in their original Japanese and English dubbed versions. This year, the lineup boasts the 20th anniversary of ""Howl's Moving Castle,"" the 35th anniversary of ""Kiki's Delivery Service"" and the 30th anniversary of ""Pom Poko.""

And these titles can generate big box-office hauls even decades after they were first released.

Fathom's three-weekend run of the original Lord of the Rings trilogy resulted in $8.2 million at the box office.

""Lord of the Rings was wildly successful nationwide, and for us,"" Bagby said. ""We just did 4DX Lord of the Rings this weekend in our new Dallas theater, and we sold out every single show.""

4DX is a screen format that utilizes motion seats, practical effects and sensory elements to immerse viewers in a movie experience.

Audiences are already buying tickets for showings in August celebrating the 15th anniversary of ""Coraline,"" which will be shown widely in 3D for the first time since its original release.

Fathom re-released ""Coraline"" twice before with great success. In 2022, the film showed in 800 theaters for one day and tallied $1.2 million in ticket sales. Last year, the film extended its release to five days and snared $7.1 million, making it the highest-grossing classic film release in Fathom history.

That $7.1 million figure is about 10% of the initial domestic run for ""Coraline"" in 2009 and 42% of its opening weekend, according to data from Comscore.

What's more, 53% of the audience who attended screenings of the film last year were 34 years old or younger.

""New audiences are seeing it for the first time although the film is 15 years old,"" said Ray Nutt, CEO of Fathom Events.

Fathom reports presales for this year's screenings of ""Coraline"" are selling seven times as many tickets per location as were sold during the same period last year, with two-thirds of those ticket sales for the 3D version of the film.

Because Fathom has a wide footprint through its parent companies and nationwide marketing, it does the heavy lifting for smaller theater chains.

""[Fathom has] built a lot of relationships,"" Phoenix Theatre's Hohman said. ""They worked out the licensing and they created the marketing behind re-releasing these classic films that, you know, we just can't do ourselves. It's a national campaign. So, I think that they just offer a lot of value.""","At a time when the box office is starved for content and audiences seem pickier than ever, Fathom Events is posting record revenue gains.

DETROIT — Purchasing a vehicle has never been that easy. But shoppers entering traditional dealer showrooms for the foreseeable future may have a new challenge: An alphabet soup of ""electrified"" vehicle offerings. As all-electric vehicle adoption crawls along in the U.S., automakers are increasingly releasing various hybrid vehicles as alternative options to EVs and traditional gas-powered engines. A variety of models means more customer choice, but also more complexity for automakers and consumers, many of whom are returning to the new vehicle market for the first time in years following unprecedented supply chain shortages and record used vehicle prices. ""More choice in the marketplace is good for consumers, but only if they understand the differences,"" said Paul Waatti, director of industry analysis at AutoPacific. ""There needs to be more clarity on what the terms and acronyms actually mean, and what the potential benefits and drawbacks are."" A car shopper today has their pick of traditional internal combustion engine (ICE) vehicles; mild-hybrid electric vehicles (MHEVs); hybrid electric vehicles (HEVs); plug-in hybrid electric vehicles (PHEVs); fuel cell electric vehicles (FCEVs) and battery-electric vehicles (BEVs), also commonly known as EVs. Also coming later this year from Stellantis : range-extended electric vehicles (REEVs) that are similar to plug-in hybrid vehicles but can exclusively function as an EV, with its electric motors powered by a gas engine. Each type of vehicle may be better for a different kind of customer. All except EVs and fuel-cell vehicles continue to offer a traditional internal combustion engine combined with ""electrified"" technologies such as a battery or motor to assist in performance or fuel economy. Heather Seymour, of St. Johns, Florida, said she did quite a bit of research prior to purchasing a 2022 Jeep Wrangler Rubicon plug-in hybrid electric vehicle, known as a 4xe model. ""I knew I wanted to kind of dip my toe in the water of the hybrids. I wasn't ready to go full electric, so the plug-in was definitely of interest to me,"" said Seymour, who said she typically uses the all-electric range of the SUV, except on longer trips. ""The more we learned about it, the more we figured out what we wanted.""

EV naming

While consumers may not need to know every acronym or technology to find their right model, automakers aren't exactly helping the situation with their consumer-facing naming. For example, Hyundai's Genesis brand calls its all-electric vehicles ""electrified,"" while many others reserve that term for hybrids. Chrysler's Pacifica minivan is a plug-in hybrid labeled as a regular ""hybrid,"" and Toyota markets some of its traditional hybrids as ""hybrid EVs."" Stellantis says its REEV vehicles are not PHEVs, despite operating similarly. ""Every automaker is using different terms. There's no standardization, and that causes some confusion on the consumer side,"" Waatti said.

Some automakers such as General Motors also use traditional nameplates such as the Chevrolet Blazer and Equinox for new EVs that share little to nothing with their gas-powered counterparts other than the name. Stellantis' Jeep also uses the ""Wagoneer"" moniker for two large gas-powered SUVs as well as a smaller, all-electric Wagoneer ""S"" SUV. Jeep CEO Antonio Filosa has said he isn't worried about any confusion, as the brand has a strong naming heritage and customers can decide which vehicle is best for their needs. ""I believe that we need education, but after education we have a lot of choices for the consumer,"" he said during a recent interview. ""It's all for the benefit of the consumer. They will have a lot of flexibility.""

Education is key

One thing automotive executives from Japan and South Korea to Detroit and Germany can agree on is the need for consumer education. Whether vehicles are electrified or all-electric, they're critical for automakers to meet tightening emissions and fuel economy targets as well as to build production scale, reduce prices and increase profits. ""We don't want to force a customer to do something they're not ready for,"" Kia America VP of Marketing Russell Wager told CNBC earlier this year. ""We're trying our best to educate them.""

Kia and its dealers have put out myth-busting pages online to answer concerns or frequently asked questions about EVs and hybrids. They range from technical questions about batteries to practical questions like whether you can go through a car wash in an EV (you can). GM has taken it a step further. The Detroit automaker launched ""EV Live"" in 2022. It's an online video platform, now known as ""GM Energy Live,"" that allows participants to interact one-on-one with EV specialists and learn about electric vehicles and charging. Ford Motor recently launched its own video-based training program, geared toward its more than 3,000 U.S. franchised dealers to improve customer service, better engage employees and provide dealers and the company with more data to help in selling the vehicles. Auto executives say it's up to the companies as well as their dealers to be trained and educated about the benefits of the vehicles, whatever they may be. ""Each customer, in the end, is very different,"" said Jérémie Papin, chair of Nissan Americas, earlier this year. ""I think it's what the vehicle can do for them,"" not necessarily how the technology works, he said.

Automotive alphabet soup The automotive industry has more powertrain and ""propulsion"" options than ever before. Here's a breakdown: Internal combustion engine (ICE): A ""traditional"" vehicle with an engine that's fueled with gasoline or diesel.

Plug-in hybrid electric vehicle (PHEV) : These vehicles feature an internal combustion engine combined with a hybrid system, including a larger battery than traditional hybrid vehicles as well as a plug to recharge the vehicle's battery. They typically allow drivers to travel a certain number of miles using the battery before the engine is needed to power the car or truck.

They typically allow drivers to travel a certain number of miles using the battery before the engine is needed to power the car or truck. Battery-electric vehicle (BEV): These all-electric vehicles do not feature an internal combustion engine. Instead, they contain an electric motor that's powered by a large battery. They need to be recharged using an electrical outlet and charging port or charging station.

They need to be recharged using an electrical outlet and charging port or charging station. Fuel cell electric vehicle (FCEV): Hydrogen fuel cell electric vehicles and equipment operate much like BEVs but are powered by electricity generated from hydrogen and oxygen instead of pure batteries, which commonly include lithium. They're filled up with a nozzle, similar to traditional gas and diesel vehicles.

They're filled up with a nozzle, similar to traditional gas and diesel vehicles. Range-extended electric vehicles (REEV): These are an emerging technology that largely function as a PHEV, however after the battery runs out of energy to power the vehicle, an engine works as a generator to exclusively power electric motors. The vehicle still drives like an EV instead of having the engine directly power the vehicle's motion.

Consumer adoption","A car shopper today has their pick of traditional internal combustion engine (ICE) vehicles; mild-hybrid electric vehicles (MHEVs); hybrid electric vehicles (HEVs); plug-in hybrid electric vehicles (PHEVs); fuel cell electric vehicles (FCEVs) and battery-electric vehicles (BEVs), also commonly known as EVs.

That's according to the hundreds of items on display at the Summer Fancy Food Show, a trade show hosted by the Specialty Food Association that has gained a reputation as a place to spot the next big flavors, foods and drinks that will dominate menus and grocery store shelves. The annual show returned to the Jacob K. Javits Convention Center in New York this week, running Sunday through Tuesday. More than 2,400 companies exhibited their foods and drinks for attendees, which include restaurant operators, specialty food retailers and trendspotters. Past show trends that are making their way to mainstream consumers' palettes include yuzu, mushrooms and sophisticated alcohol substitutes. Previous shows have also been a springboard for small brands seeking a wider audience. Honest Tea, Ben & Jerry's and Tate's Bake Shop are among the companies that attended the show in their early days on their way to becoming well-known consumer brands now owned by the industry's biggest players. Here are some highlights from this year's Summer Fancy Food Show:

Honey — as a flavor

Humans have been eating honey for thousands of years, but it's taking center stage as a flavor with some food and beverage makers. In the SFA's preliminary report on the show, its trendspotters called out honey, noting its health benefits. Honey was the star in both foods and drinks across the show. Green Bee showed off its honey soda, which includes a Honeycomb Cider flavor. Owl Creek Organics & Natural Flavors displayed honey spreads, with flavors ranging from caffe mocha to lemon poppyseed. And Dutch company Klepper & Klepper used honey as a flavor for their licorice.

Tinned fish

Krill Arctic Foods' tinned krill meat Amelia Lucas | CNBC

In years past, tinned fish was relegated primarily to booths in the Spanish and Portuguese pavilions. But this year, exhibitors showed off their tinned fish products across the show floor. TikTok helped fuel the tinned fish trend last year, boosting sales of canned sardines. Now specialty food companies are responding. This isn't the canned tuna of yore. There are more flavors, different seafood varieties and trendier packaging. Wildfish Cannery, an Alaska-based company that was founded in 1987, showed off a new retro design for its sockeye salmon, giving it a more upscale feel. Krill Arctic Foods exhibited its canned krill meat, which may lack the same curb appeal on its packaging but boasts about the food's nutritional profile.

Fish to go

Exhibitors also showed off new ways to eat fish on the go, hoping to capitalize on consumers' desire for convenience and more protein in their diets. The association named ""satisfying snacks"" as one of the trends that it's been watching. Acme Smoked Fish highlighted its new Lox in a Box snack kits, available with cream cheese or avocado. Legend of Master International, an Asian food supplier, sampled its Kani fish cake sticks, made to eat like string cheese or for cooking.

Upgraded charcuterie

Fossil Farms' array of salami flavors, including lamb and bison Amelia Lucas | CNBC

Like tinned fish, the popularity of charcuterie boards owes a lot to social media, where users can dazzle their followers with elaborate displays of preserved meats, cheeses and fruit. Companies at the Summer Fancy Food Show showed off some new options to level up the charcuterie — especially the salami. Tempesta Artisan Salumi offered up black truffle-flavored salami, while Salt & Twine's selection included a mezcal and salted lime flavor. But exhibitors weren't just having fun with the flavors. Some are looking beyond pork to make the cured meat. Driftless Provisions' salami uses elk, venison and bison alongside pork. Fossil Farms' salami lineup included lamb and wagyu beef.

CNBC,https://www.cnbc.com/2024/06/29/bandit-running-unsponsored-project-decks-out-olympic-hopefuls.html,2024-06-29,12:00:01 UTC,"Why so many Olympic hopefuls are running in all-black, unbranded gear","Christopher Royster, left, and JT Smith, athletes who participate in Bandit Running's Unsponsored Project, at the 2024 Olympic trials in Eugene, Oregon.

There's an army of unsponsored athletes commanding attention at the U.S. Track & Field Olympic Trials this year, decked out in all-black, logo-less gear.

The 35 athletes are supported by apparel company Bandit Running's Unsponsored Project, an effort to challenge the standard sponsorship model for professional athletes and boost up-and-coming competitors.

Unsponsored athletes in track and field would typically purchase their own apparel bearing the emblems of major brands, effectively providing free advertising for the companies. Instead, Bandit Running offers Olympic hopefuls the all-black kits and warmups — along with short-term endorsement deals.

Bandit co-founder Tim West said the company is giving out at least 35 two-week deals for unsponsored runners at the trials, a U.S. Olympian's gateway into the four-year games. The deals consist of unbranded apparel, a platform and cash to cover expenses. Last year, Bandit partnered with nine athletes.

""We're really hoping for a new sponsorship model where brands take a healthy piece of their budget and apply it to the kind of amateur, sub-elite athlete to help grow the sport. I think when you lift up, sort of the bottom, everything pushes up,"" West told CNBC.

Bandit's deals have a built-in release clause, West said, allowing an easy out for athletes who get a traditional sponsorship offer during the trials.

Given the high prices associated with competing, West said unsponsored athletes are ""investing in themselves,"" posing an opportunity for brands to step in and help out.

And, the all-black, logo-free kits help call attention to which athletes may be available to strike a longer-term deal.

Among them is Courtney Okolo, a 400-meter runner.

After winning a gold medal in the 2016 Rio Olympics and being sponsored by Nike for four years, Okolo, 30, is embracing the Unsponsored Project. She said getting support while competing without a sponsorship is difficult, but Bandit's initiative makes it feel like she isn't doing it all on her own.","Christopher Royster, left, and JT Smith, athletes who participate in Bandit Running's Unsponsored Project, at the 2024 Olympic trials in Eugene, Oregon.

Pfizer had a ""phenomenal"" first quarter — and Wall Street took notice, CEO Albert Bourla told thousands of employees during a companywide town hall on May 2, according to a recording heard by CNBC. A day earlier, the pharmaceutical giant's stock had closed 6% higher after its quarterly results topped analyst estimates and it hiked its full-year outlook. It was a far cry from the year prior, when Pfizer's shares plunged more than 40%, making it one of the worst-performing large pharmaceutical stocks of 2023. Its market cap of about $157 billion is now less than half of its 2021 peak of nearly $350 billion. Few companies benefited from the pandemic as much as Pfizer did. The drugmaker's profits boomed, fueled by its Covid vaccine and antiviral pill Paxlovid. After Pfizer and German company BioNTech rapidly developed and deployed a lifesaving shot that helped the world emerge from the pandemic, Pfizer drew widespread praise. Pfizer's success contributed to its equally jarring fall from grace. When the virus receded in 2023, its Covid products revenue plummeted. The world, which hailed Pfizer as a pandemic hero a few years earlier, no longer needed the company in the same way. Pfizer may be on its way toward stabilizing its business and winning back Wall Street's favor after the strong first quarter. But the company is struggling to balance that with the fears of its employees, some of whom said they feel uncertain about their future and unmotivated after the sudden reversal of fortune. In October Pfizer launched a multibillion-dollar cost-cutting program, slashing research and development spending and laying off hundreds of employees — including in the once-lauded Covid vaccine unit. In May the company said it's on track to deliver $4 billion in savings by the end of the year.

Stock Chart Icon Stock chart icon Pfizer's stock surged after it rolled out its Covid vaccine and antiviral treatment, then plunged when the company's Covid revenue started to drop.

Now, as Pfizer appears poised to turn a corner, the company is trying to boost employee morale to match Wall Street's optimism. CNBC spoke with 11 current and former Pfizer employees — all of whom asked to remain anonymous for fear of retaliation — about Pfizer's dizzying climb, rapid decline and turnaround strategy. The company's seesawing fortunes have fueled uncertainty within Pfizer's workforce. Most of the current and former employees CNBC spoke with called Pfizer a good place to work, and some current employees said they feel optimistic about the direction of the company after the first quarter. But other current employees are dissatisfied with where the strategy shift has left them. Some cited higher workloads after teams were stretched thin by budget cuts, a return-to-office policy they said has forced out some remote workers, and doubts about how the business will perform moving forward. The company's separate multiyear cost-cutting program announced in May is also stoking fears about the potential for new U.S. layoffs, according to some current workers. Some employees working in certain manufacturing and supply chain divisions, which they believe are likely to be affected by the cuts, described having low morale and motivation to work. Meanwhile, several former Pfizer employees, most of whom were laid off over the last six months or left voluntarily, said they're unhappy with how the company handled cost cuts in 2023. Some alleged that Pfizer management provided little transparency around the layoffs and seemed more focused on the company's stock performance than its staff throughout the process. During the latest town hall, Bourla told employees that layoffs in the U.S. have been completed but that more are occurring internationally. He called the job cuts ""very, very painful"" and said it was ""killing"" him to let employees go. But he also acknowledged that Wall Street likes the cuts. ""And, of course, I'm very concerned with everyone that could be affected and impacted by that, but it works,"" Bourla said, according to the recording. ""And we saw it, how the Street will respond."" A Pfizer spokesperson said reducing costs will ""put us on strong footing towards margin expansion and improved financial returns moving forward."" The spokesperson added that cutting expenses is one of Pfizer's five priorities for the year, along with maximizing the performance of new products, innovating its drug pipeline, growing its oncology business with its acquisition of cancer drugmaker Seagen, and allocating capital to increase its dividend, reduce outstanding debt and reinvest in the business. To cut costs, apart from layoffs the company is trimming its drug portfolio and direct marketing spending, shrinking its real estate footprint and reducing its investment in Covid, among other efforts, said the spokesperson. The spokesperson said Pfizer does not take the layoffs ""lightly"" and that the company is ""focused on providing our impacted colleagues with the resources and compassion they deserve.""

What went wrong in 2023

Pfizer entered 2023 on a high. The company had just capped a record-breaking 2022 with $100 billion in sales, more than half of which came from its Covid vaccines and Paxlovid. Employee morale at Pfizer was relatively high at the time, some current and former workers told CNBC. The company had gone on a hiring spree and piled money into different projects, they said. The success came with trade-offs. Two former employees involved in developing the Covid vaccine manufacturing process said they were experiencing burnout at the start of 2023. In January 2023, Pfizer forecast a steep drop in annual revenue, to between $67 billion and $71 billion. That outlook included $13.5 billion and $8 billion in sales of Covid vaccines and Paxlovid, respectively. But it could not predict at the time just how much revenue would dry up.

During an earnings call that same month, Pfizer executives said they expected roughly 24% of the U.S. population to get an annual Covid booster in 2023. But by December, only around 17% of U.S. adults had received the new Covid shots from Pfizer and Moderna, according to data from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Many Americans who got previous Covid shots felt they did not need more protection because the threat of the virus had diminished, according to recent surveys. Meanwhile, use of Paxlovid in the U.S. was dented by reductions in Covid testing and infection rates, and by doctors' concerns about interactions with common medications, among other factors. As demand plummeted, the federal government returned millions of the antiviral treatment courses to Pfizer. In January this year, however, Pfizer said fewer courses were returned by the end of 2023 than it had expected. The company soon acknowledged the challenges its Covid business faced towards the end of 2023. In October, Pfizer said it slashed both ends of its 2023 sales guidance by around $9 billion ""solely due to its Covid products."" At the same time, Pfizer started to cut costs. The company still hasn't said how many employees it laid off, though it reduced staff around the world. Pfizer's 2023 revenue ultimately came in at $58.5 billion, including $11.22 billion from its Covid vaccine and $1.28 billion from Paxlovid. The end of the year brought other challenges for Pfizer: The company scrapped the twice-daily version of its experimental weight loss drug, danuglipron, and saw slower uptake for a newly launched RSV vaccine in the U.S. than competitor GSK saw with its own version. After the string of difficulties, investors showed relief when Pfizer announced the cost cuts. But for many employees, the shift in post-pandemic strategy was a nightmare, they told CNBC. During a conference in January, Bourla acknowledged that 2023 was a rough year for the company and its stock price. But he said Pfizer took steps to start 2024 with a ""clean slate."" Those included renegotiating multibillion-dollar Covid contracts with the EU and other governments, transitioning its Covid products to the commercial market in several countries and writing off unused stock of its vaccine and Paxlovid. ""So it's not simple, how many people will use the vaccine. There were a lot of things we had to remove"" he said. Bourla also touted Pfizer's portfolio of new products that it said will boost sales, including nine new product approvals in the U.S. last year and a pipeline of drugs that could bring in more future revenue. Pfizer has also repeatedly said that the Seagen deal brings a proven antibody-drug conjugate platform that enhances its commercial structure and could help the company become a ""world-class oncology leader."" Pfizer has said Seagen could contribute more than $10 billion in risk-adjusted sales by 2030 with its targeted cancer therapies. Those revenue streams would help Pfizer prepare for upcoming patent expirations for blockbuster drugs, including its breast cancer treatment Ibrance, and Eliquis, a blood thinner it shares with Bristol Myers Squibb .

A 'slap in the face'

Some current and former employees said they knew early in 2023 that wide-scale layoffs were possible. Those people alleged that Pfizer has long had a culture of hiring too many people and later laying many employees off — a cycle seen at many other large companies. Pfizer wasn't the only Covid-boom company whose business declined. Biotech company Moderna 's revenue from its Covid shot also plunged in 2023. Companies outside the pharmaceutical industry that flourished in 2020, including fitness firm Peloton and digital meeting platform Zoom , also struggled to adjust as people returned to their pre-pandemic lives. Other drugmakers big and small are still downsizing and restructuring their workforces. Big pharmaceutical companies, such as Bristol Myers Squibb, are trying to conserve cash as they could lose revenue from upcoming drug patent expirations and Medicare drug price negotiations, among other threats. Biotech companies are also working to stay afloat after a rough 2023 marked by rising interest rates, a poor deal market and a lack of fundraising. At Pfizer, there were other warnings of trouble ahead, according to current and former employees: a small round of layoffs during the first quarter of 2023 and budget restrictions that limited travel, team lunch outings and purchases of new lab and manufacturing equipment. Pfizer's announcement in March 2023 that it would acquire Seagen for a whopping $43 billion was another sign, according to some current and former employees. While most of the 11 workers acknowledged that the deal made sense for Pfizer's growth, they said the hefty price tag at a time when Covid sales had already started to decline left them uneasy. Still, a few former employees said they felt blindsided by the company's decision to let go of staff, saying they were relatively optimistic about the business before the October cost-cut announcement. One former employee who worked at a site focused on gene therapies in Durham, North Carolina, said they were repeatedly told their job would be safe — even as Pfizer divested much of its early stage portfolio for those treatments at the start of 2023. The company confirmed with news outlets in October that it would close that site and lay off an undisclosed number of staff. Notably, Pfizer's layoffs also affected some workers involved in the research, development and manufacturing of the company's Covid vaccine, according to some current and former employees. They said those workers, whom Pfizer celebrated as pandemic heroes just a year earlier, felt especially betrayed by the cuts. ""It felt like we were tossed out the door when they no longer needed us,"" said one former employee who worked on the vaccine.

All the current and former employees who spoke with CNBC said they believed the company handled the layoffs and the months leading up to them poorly. Some workers said they were disappointed with what they called higher management's lack of transparency around the layoffs. Some also questioned why Pfizer did not set more realistic expectations for its Covid business earlier, especially as cases and public concern about the virus diminished in the U.S. On Oct. 17, just a few days after Pfizer publicly announced its cost-cutting program to investors, executives held a companywide town hall with Pfizer's more than 80,000-person workforce that one worker described as ""disastrous"" and another called a ""slap in the face."" On the town hall, Bourla and Pfizer Chief Human Experience Officer Payal Sahni Becher acknowledged the company's Covid business was struggling but said it was positioning for growth with the cost cuts, according to some current and former employees. Those people said the executives addressed the looming layoffs during the town hall but provided scant details on how many workers, teams or sites they would affect, when they would occur or how the company decided who would lose their jobs. Many workers also alleged that Bourla and Becher were too casual during the town hall, cracking light jokes and chuckling at some of the questions asked by staff, such as one about employee bonuses.

Return-to-office policies

On top of layoffs, return-to-office policies launched in 2023 forced out some workers in fully remote roles, some current and former employees said. Those people said some fully remote employees had their virtual work status revoked and were asked to start working in person at their site starting on a certain date under the new mandates. While some workers were asked to come in only two or three days a week, even that was impossible for staff members who lived too far from their sites, according to the employees. Some remote workers who did not comply over time were let go, the current and former employees said. A Pfizer spokesperson did not confirm or provide any details about its recent return-to-office policies. ""The return to office has been possibly the worst managed factor in all of this,"" one current employee said.

Those policies also applied to workers who were relocated from recently closed facilities, according to some employees. For example, Pfizer in October said it would shut down its office in Peapack, New Jersey in 2024, which affected nearly 800 workers. The company first announced those plans in 2021. Pfizer told news outlets that the majority of employees would be relocated to its headquarters in New York City. For one employee, a 15-minute commute to work became closer to an hour-and-a-half trip. During another town hall, on Oct. 26, Pfizer Chief Global Supply Officer Mike McDermott said the decision to close the Peapack site ""wasn't made lightly."" But he said having Peapack employees work in person at the company's headquarters was ""right for Pfizer's culture,"" according to a recording heard by CNBC. He said the company isn't taking away remote work as an option. Pfizer leadership has been vocal about asking employees to work in person again. ""Teleconferencing is simply no substitute for the personal interaction that makes it possible to share ideas, build connection, or even agree to disagree,"" Bourla said during the APEC CEO Summit in November. Pfizer is just one of several companies across different industries to push for in-person work again after the pandemic. Tech giants such as Google similarly reversed course on remote work in 2023 after offering flexibility to employees throughout Covid, reportedly frustrating workers.

Employee morale

Employee morale plummeted in the months after the October layoff announcement, according to current and former employees. Some of those people said they were unmotivated to work with their job security in question, while one worker described ""walking on eggshells"" for weeks out of fear that they would lose their job. Other employees said they were stretched thin due to understaffing and a lack of other resources. A few workers said they struggled to keep up with abrupt internal changes, such as being assigned to new managers or being moved onto different teams. Some current employees said Pfizer has held several so-called transparency meetings, which allow workers to anonymously ask questions and provide feedback to senior leadership. Faith in executive leadership also plunged among some workers, according to most of the current and former employees who spoke with CNBC. Some employees acknowledged that executives have a duty to care about their company's stock price but said that Bourla and other officials appeared to be hyper-focused on Pfizer shares even as people lost their jobs. Some current workers said that hasn't appeared to change after the town hall on May 2. Others said Bourla's remarks were encouraging and sounded far more genuine.

Nike CEO John Donahoe appears to be on thin ice. The former top executive of eBay , who has been at the helm of Nike since January 2020, is starting to lose Wall Street's confidence after the company capped off a lackluster fiscal year with more bad news. On Thursday, Nike warned that sales in its current quarter were expected to decline by a staggering 10% – far worse than the 3.2% drop LSEG had projected – after it posted its slowest annual sales gain in 14 years, excluding the Covid-19 pandemic. The company also said it expects fiscal 2025 sales to be down mid-single digits when it previously expected them to grow. The warning signs led shares to close 20% lower on Friday -- making it the worst trading day in the company's history since its IPO in Dec. 1980. The plunge wiped about $28 billion off of Nike's market cap, bringing it to just under $114 billion from $142 billion a day earlier. As Wall Street digested the dismal outlook from the world's largest sportswear company, at least six investment banks downgraded Nike's stock. Analysts at Morgan Stanley and Stifel took it a step further, specifically calling the company's management into question. ""The FY25 guide (the 5th downward consensus revision in 6 quarters), pushes prospects for growth inflection further into 2025 (perhaps FY4Q or spring '25 at the earliest) asking investors to both underwrite success of not yet proven styles and look across an uncertain consumer discretionary backdrop into 2HCY24 until momentum could build again into 2HCY25,"" wrote Stifel analyst Jim Duffy. ""Management credibility is severely challenged and potential for C-level regime change adds further uncertainty.""

Stock Chart Icon Stock chart icon Nike stock has underperformed the S&P 500 during CEO John Donahoe's tenure.

Since Donahoe took over as Nike's top executive, its stock is down more than 25% as of Friday's close, significantly underperforming both the S&P 500 and the XRT – the retail-focused ETF – which saw gains of around 67% and 66% in that time period, respectively. Nike finance chief Matt Friend on Thursday attributed the guidance cut to a host of factors. Some, like softness in China and challenging foreign exchange headwinds, are outside of Nike's control, but others are problems it squarely created under Donahoe's leadership. The company is expecting wholesale orders to be slow as it scales new styles, pulls back on classic franchises and works to repair its relationships with key retail partners after spending the last few years cutting them off in favor of a direct-selling strategy. At the same time, loyal customers who shop on Nike's website are no longer springing for new pairs of Air Force 1s, Air Jordan 1s or Dunks, the company's core franchises. Critics say the sneaker lines have dominated the retailer's offerings for too long and turned customers away as they sought fresh styles and innovative designs from a slew of upstart competitors. That's left Nike to win back some of its most essential customers – runners. As the retailer focused on its direct-selling strategy at the expense of innovation, scrappy competitors like On Running and Hoka snatched up market share.","In this article NKE Follow your favorite stocks CREATE FREE ACCOUNTJohn Donahoe, attends the first day of the annual Allen & Company Sun Valley Conference, in Sun Valley, Idaho.

NASA and Boeing are further extending the first Starliner crewed flight but are not yet setting a new target date for returning the capsule to Earth, the organizations announced Friday.

Boeing's Starliner capsule ""Calypso"" will stay at the International Space Station into next month while the company and NASA conduct new testing back on the ground. Boeing's crew flight test represents the first time Starliner is carrying people, flying NASA astronauts Butch Wilmore and Suni Williams.

Officials say the Starliner team is starting a test campaign of the spacecraft's thruster technology at White Sands, New Mexico — testing that will be completed before Starliner returns to Earth.

""We think the testing could take a couple of weeks. We're trying to replicate the inflight conditions as best we can on the ground,"" NASA's Commercial Crew manager Steve Stich said during a press conference.

Before launching on June 5, Boeing and NASA planned for Starliner to be in space for nine days. As of Friday, the Starliner flight has tallied 24 days and counting.

Despite the extended stay at the ISS, officials emphasized that Starliner is safe to return at any point in case of an emergency. NASA and Boeing say the delay for testing is solely to gather more data about the spacecraft's performance, in particular its thruster system.

""I want to make it very clear that Butch and Suni are not stranded in space,"" Stich said.

The Starliner crew flight test represents a final major step before NASA certifies Boeing to fly crew on operational, six-month missions. Yet, similar to the previous two spaceflights that were uncrewed, Starliner is running into several problems during the mission.","Boeing's crew flight test represents the first time Starliner is carrying people, flying NASA astronauts Butch Wilmore and Suni Williams.

Ford Motor expects to introduce a $30,000 all-electric vehicle that will be profitable in roughly two and a half years, CEO Jim Farley said Friday during the Aspen Ideas Festival.

Farley did not release many other details about the vehicle, which is being developed by a Ford ""skunkworks"" team, but said its main competitors are expected to be Chinese automakers such as BYD and an anticipated entry-level car from U.S. EV leader Tesla .

Farley said Ford is first focusing on smaller EVs instead of larger all-electric trucks and SUVs, which have historically been gas-powered profit engines for the company, because such vehicles are ""never going to make money.""

""You have to make a radical change as an [automaker] to get to a profitable EV. The first thing we have to do is really put all of our capital toward smaller, more affordable EVs,"" Farley said during an interview with CNBC's Julia Boorstin. ""That's the duty cycle that we've now found that really matches. These big, huge, enormous EVs, they're never going to make money. The battery is $50,000. … The batteries will never be affordable.""

A Ford spokesman later clarified Farley was referring to large vehicles such as the company's Super Duty models or vehicles that require massive battery packs to achieve significant EV ranges of 500 miles. He was not referring to ones such as Ford's current all-electric F-150 Lightning pickup or next-generation EVs.

Ford earlier this year said it was postponing production of a large three-row SUV at a plant in Canada to 2027 from its initial plan of 2025. It also postponed a next-generation pickup, codenamed ""T3,"" from late 2025 to 2026.

Farley on Friday reiterated Ford's next-generation vehicles would be profitable.

He also said Americans need to ""get back in love"" with small cars instead of larger ones, a surprising statement given a majority or Ford's profits come from trucks and considering American carmakers have historically had trouble making money on small models.

""We have to start to get back in love with smaller vehicles. It's super important for our society and for EV adoption,"" Farley said Friday. ""We are just in love with these monster vehicles, and I love them too, but it's a major issue with weight.""

Ford's EV unit lost $1.32 billion during the first quarter of this year on 10,000 vehicles wholesaled. While the unit also includes EV-related business such as software, those losses equate to a loss of $132,000 per vehicle the unit sells.

Farley said it is crucial for Ford to make profitable EVs in the next five years as Chinese automakers continue to expand globally.

""If we cannot make money on EVs, we have competitors who have the largest market in the world, who already dominate globally, already setting up their supply chain around the world,"" he said. ""And if we don't make profitable EVs in the next five years, what is the future? We will just shrink into North America.""","Ford Motor expects to introduce a $30,000 all-electric vehicle that will be profitable in roughly two and a half years, CEO Jim Farley said Friday during the Aspen Ideas Festival.

CNBC,https://www.cnbc.com/2024/06/28/tractor-supply-ends-dei-pride-support-carbon-goals.html,2024-06-28,15:22:47 UTC,"Rural retailer Tractor Supply eliminates DEI roles, Pride support and carbon emissions goals","Shoppers are seen at the parking lot of a Tractor Supply Co. store near Bloomsburg.

Tractor Supply, a retail chain that sells home improvement equipment, livestock and agricultural supplies for farmers and pet owners, is eliminating diversity, equity and inclusion roles; withdrawing carbon emission goals; and walking back support for the LGBTQ community as part of sweeping changes to environmental, social and governance initiatives, the company announced this week.

The retailer said in a Thursday release that it will no longer submit data to the Human Rights Campaign, an LGBTQ advocacy group. The company will also stop sponsoring Pride festivals and voting campaigns, the release said. The company previously earned a perfect score on the Human Rights Campaign Foundation's 2022 Best Places to Work Corporate Equality Index.

The announcement comes in the final days of Pride Month.

Tractor Supply is also retiring initiatives aimed at reducing environmental impact and improving employee diversity. The company had set goals to achieve net zero carbon emissions in operations by 2040 and to reduce its water usage by 2025. Its DEI targets included boosting the number of employees of color at the manager level and above by 50% by 2026.

Tractor Supply said it's making the changes to better represent the values of the communities and customers it serves. The retailer caters to largely rural communities, with 50,000 employees across 2,250 stores in 49 states, according to company data.

""Rural communities are the backbone of our nation and what make America great,"" Tractor Supply said in the news release. ""We have heard from customers that we have disappointed them. We have taken this feedback to heart.""

Tractor Supply said it has invested millions of dollars in veteran causes, state fairs, animal shelters, rodeos and farmers markets and that it invests in the future of rural America by being the largest supporter of FFA, a nonprofit that promotes agricultural education for middle and high schoolers.

The retailer was previously included on Newsweek's list of America's Greatest Workplaces for Diversity in 2023 and was named to Bloomberg's Gender Equality Index for 2022 and 2023.

The publicly traded company has a market valuation of about $29 billion. CNBC contacted Tractor Supply for more details about the changes, and the company declined to comment beyond the release.

The changes come amid a growing wave of anti-DEI sentiment in the wake of a U.S. Supreme Court decision in 2023 to strike down affirmative action in colleges. Experts at the time predicted the ruling could have implications for corporate hiring or recruiting.

Companies, including Starbucks , Disney and Target , have faced legal challenges over DEI initiatives for LGBTQ customers and employees. In February 2023, pharmaceutical giant Pfizer dropped race-based eligibility requirements for a fellowship program designed for college students of Black, Latino and Native American descent, the Associated Press reported.","Shoppers are seen at the parking lot of a Tractor Supply Co. store near Bloomsburg.

Shares of Nike plunged on Friday after the retailer cut its full-year guidance and said it expects sales to drop 10% during its current quarter as it warned of soft sales in China and ""uneven"" consumer trends across the globe.

The expected 10% first-quarter slump is far below the 3.2% drop that analysts had expected, according to LSEG.

Nike shares plunged nearly 20% in trading Friday.

The sneaker giant, which reported quarterly earnings Thursday, now expects fiscal 2025 sales to be down mid-single digits, compared to analyst estimates of a 0.9% increase. Nike previously expected sales to grow. The company also expects sales in the first half to be down in the high single digits, compared to previous guidance of declines in the low single digits.

""A comeback at this scale takes time,"" the retailer's finance chief Matthew Friend said on a call with analysts Thursday. ""Although the next few quarters will be challenging, we are confident that we are repositioning Nike to be more competitive with a more balanced portfolio to drive sustainable, profitable, long-term growth.""

The company cut its guidance as it contends with slower online sales, planned declines in classic footwear franchises, ""increased macro uncertainty"" in the Greater China region and ""uneven consumer trends"" across Nike's markets, Friend said. It also expects sales into wholesalers to be slower as it scales new innovations and pulls back on classic franchises.

For the fiscal fourth quarter, the company handily beat earnings estimates as its cost-cutting efforts continue to bear fruit, but Nike fell short on revenue.

Here's how Nike did during the period compared with what Wall Street was anticipating, based on a survey of analysts by LSEG:

Earnings per share: $1.01 adjusted vs. 83 cents expected

$1.01 adjusted vs. 83 cents expected Revenue: $12.61 billion vs. $12.84 billion expected

The company's reported net income for the three-month period that ended May 31 was $1.5 billion, or 99 cents per share, compared with $1.03 billion, or 66 cents per share, a year earlier.

Sales dropped to $12.61 billion, down about 2% from $12.83 billion a year earlier.

In fiscal 2024, Nike posted sales of $51.36 billion, which is flat compared to the prior year. It's the slowest pace of annual sales growth the company has seen since 2010, excluding the Covid-19 pandemic.

Nike executives attributed the sales miss to a range of factors. They said its lifestyle business declined during the quarter and that momentum in its performance business, such as its basketball and running shoes, wasn't enough to offset it.

Online performance was soft because Nike had a higher share of lifestyle products, more promotions and fewer sales of classic franchises, such as its Air Force 1. It also saw traffic in China decline across all channels beginning in April due to macro conditions in the region.

Despite the traffic decline in China, sales in the region exceeded Wall Street expectations, according to StreetAccount, coming in at $1.86 billion, compared with estimates of $1.79 billion. It was the only geographical segment to top estimates for the period.

Sales in North America, its largest market, came in at $5.28 billion, below StreetAccount expectations of $5.45 billion.

In Europe, Middle East and Africa, Nike posted revenue of $3.29 billion, compared to estimates of $3.32 billion. In Asia Pacific and Latin America, Nike saw $1.71 billion in sales, compared to estimates of $1.77 billion.

Still, Friend later warned of the ""softer outlook"" in China and said had it not been for Chinese marketplace Tmall's early start to the region's 618 shopping holiday, sales in the country would've fallen short of Nike's internal expectations.

""The China marketplace remains highly promotional, and we continue to manage both Nike and partners' inventory carefully,"" said Friend. ""While our outlook for the near term has softened, we remain confident in Nike's competitive position in China in the long term.""

Nike's Converse brand was once again a significant underperformer in the overall results. The division saw revenue plunge 18% to $480 million, largely due to declines in North America and Western Europe.","Nike previously expected sales to grow.
It also expects sales into wholesalers to be slower as it scales new innovations and pulls back on classic franchises.

She bought an inflatable pool from Sam's Club.

The pool began leaking air after just a few uses.

For Crozier, chief merchant of the Walmart -owned membership club, that trashed pool — and the disappointment that came with it — helped kickstart a years-long effort to catch up with chief rival Costco and the popularity of its private brand, Kirkland Signature.

As Sam's Club opens more locations, it is trying to raise the bar for its own brand, Member's Mark. The label's makeover has become critical for Sam's Club as it aims to close the gap with Costco, which has roughly the same number of U.S. clubs but about twice as much annual revenue. Net sales for Sam's Club totaled $86.2 billion in its most recent fiscal year, compared with $176.63 billion for Costco's U.S. clubs.

Sam's Club CEO Chris Nicholas told CNBC the brand's revamp was inspired, in part, by the retailer's chief rival.

""The club model survives because you have brilliant merchants focusing on creating or buying exceptional items,"" he said in an interview. ""Costco did such a great job of that over the years with Kirkland and we saw that be successful.""

The success of Member's Mark will help determine how Sam's Club fares as its expands, with plans to open more than 30 stores over the next four years. At least some stores will be in regions where potential customers belong to a competing club like Costco or B.J.'s Wholesale , or in areas where customers may need convincing to pay an annual membership to be able to shop.

Overtaking Costco and its beloved private label won't be easy for Sam's Club, said Michael Baker, a retail analyst for D.A. Davidson.

""Never say never,"" he said. ""Who knows? But I think it's going to take a long time.""

But he added Costco's success with Kirkland Signature created a formula that Sam's Club can follow.

The popularity of Kirkland's brand, which includes a diverse range of items like vodka, batteries and dress shirts, has helped to drive membership sign-ups and renewals. It is one of the features that Costco highlights when the retailer's pitch to members.","As Sam's Club opens more locations, it is trying to raise the bar for its own brand, Member's Mark.

CNBC,https://www.cnbc.com/2024/06/27/goodrx-tracker-drug-prices-rise.html,2024-06-27,22:10:55 UTC,"Drug prices have risen almost 40% over the past decade, according to a new tracker","The cost of prescription medications in the U.S. has increased 37% since 2014, far surpassing the rate of inflation, according to data from drug savings company GoodRx .

Though the price increases have slowed this year in comparison to the past decade, the higher costs are raising out-of-pocket expenses for consumers. The average American spends $16.26 out of pocket per prescription, according to the data.

""When things increase … inevitably, they do trickle down to consumers, especially those who are in a high deductible plan or who don't have insurance or find themselves paying substantially out of pocket,"" said GoodRx director of research Tori Marsh.

GoodRx said the patients' share of the cost continues to grow due to rising copays, coinsurances and deductibles. The company found that over the past 10 years, the average person's deductible nearly doubled, and copays are rising as the majority of plans are adding another tier of drugs with higher copays.

It is a dynamic GoodRx deems ""the big pinch."" High medication costs are coupled with reduced insurance coverage. Analyzing coverage for more than 3,700 Medicare Part D plans between 2010 and 2024, GoodRx found that the portion of medications covered dropped 19% during that period.

""The impact is really kind of threefold,"" Marsh said. ""Rising costs or rising prices are a big part of it, but it's really that with the combination of increased friction. … It's hard for people to, in some ways, access their medication or access a pharmacy. And then on top of that, insurance is not what it used to be. It's not covering as much as it used to.""

On average, Americans pay two to three times more for prescription drugs than consumers in other developed countries, according to the White House.

Drug costs have become a focus for President Joe Biden, particularly as he approaches the 2024 election. The Biden administration has taken several measures to lower out-of-pocket drug expenses.

On Wednesday, the White House announced it would lower prices on 64 prescription drugs for some Medicare beneficiaries as a result of inflation penalties on drugmakers.

The lower costs, effective during the third quarter, will benefit roughly 750,000 people who use the drugs annually, some of whom could save up to $4,593 per day, according to the release.

""Despite efforts by policymakers and industry leaders to break down affordability and accessibility barriers, a patient's actual out-of-pocket cost continues to increase and is often a huge surprise to them,"" said GoodRx interim CEO Scott Wagner in a news release.

Tesla is losing its lead over legacy automakers in the quality of its new all-electric vehicles, according to an annual influential study conducted by J.D. Power.

The 2024 U.S. Initial Quality Study found the quality of Tesla's battery-electric vehicles, or BEVs, and those of traditional carmakers were the same, at 266 problems reported per 100 newly sold or leased vehicles.

Previously, Tesla models had outperformed the electric vehicles of legacy automakers in the annual survey. Last year, the Tesla received a rank of 257 problems per 100 vehicles, compared with 265 problems per 100 vehicles on average for EVs from traditional automakers.

The study attributes Tesla's growing problems to a negative response from customers after the company removed traditional feature controls, such as turn signals and wiper stalks.

Across the broader industry, not just BEVs, Tesla has consistently ranked toward the bottom in initial quality since J.D. Power began including Tesla in the study in 2022.

Overall, the study, which included repair visits data of franchised dealers for the first time, found electric vehicles such as BEVs and plug-in hybrid electric vehicles (PHEVs), are plagued with more problems than traditional gas- and diesel-powered vehicles with internal combustion engines.

""Owners of cutting edge, tech-filled BEVs and PHEVs are experiencing problems that are of a severity level high enough for them to take their new vehicle into the dealership at a rate three times higher than that of gas-powered vehicle owners,"" J.D. Power's senior director of auto benchmarking, Frank Hanley, said in a news release.

The study found that plug-in vehicles require more repairs than gas-powered vehicles across all repair categories.

BEVs averaged 266 problems per 100 vehicles, 86 points higher than gas- and diesel-powered vehicles, which averaged 180 problems per 100 vehicles, according to the study. A lower score indicates higher vehicle quality.

Top concerns included features, controls and displays as well as wireless smartphone integration, as customers reported frequent difficulties with Apple CarPlay and Android Auto.

The study also reported frustration over false warnings, unnecessary traffic alerts and automatic braking features. Specifically, rear seat reminders contribute 1.7 problems per 100 vehicles across the industry, as owners report receiving signals even when no one is in the rear seat.

""It is not surprising that the introduction of new technology has challenged manufacturers to maintain vehicle quality,"" Hanley said.

2025 Rivian R1S Rivian

A Thursday investor event for Rivian Automotive that focused on cost-cutting efforts, efficiency gains and in-house technologies and software wasn't enough to build on the company's significant share growth this week. Shares of the all-electric vehicle startup fell by about 2% to 6% for much of the event, eating into some of its 23% gain in shares the day before on news of an up to $5 billion investment by Volkswagen Group . Rivian's stock closed Thursday down 1.8% to $14.47 per share, off by roughly 39% year to date amid investor concerns regarding cash burn and a slowdown in EV sales. Rivian on Thursday reconfirmed its 2024 guidance that included production of 57,000 vehicles and a path to positive gross profit during the fourth quarter, including regulatory credits. It also outlined longer-term growths, such as plans to achieve positive adjusted earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization in 2027. ""Everything that you're hearing from us, around our product, around how we're running the business, around how we're driving toward profitability, my hope is that you're seeing really an extreme sense of urgency,"" Rivian CEO RJ Scaringe said during the event. ""We're very, very fast driving towards the improvements necessary to get to positive free cash flow and, before that, positive margins this year.""

Rivian also outlined long-term financial targets of a roughly 25% gross margin, 10% free cash flow and adjusted profit margin in the ""high teens."" The company did not release a time frame for these targets. Scaringe spent much of his time during the roughly four-hour presentation discussing efficiencies in products and manufacturing, which he said are expected to lead to 20% material cost reductions in its current vehicles, followed by 45% targeted reductions in its upcoming ""R2"" vehicles, which are projected to begin production in early 2026. The reductions range from physical savings, such as a 54% decrease in design costs of its R2 vehicles compared with current models, to lower costs on more complex systems such as battery packs and electrical hardware. For example, the company is using 10 fewer in-house electronic control units, or ECUs, in its recently redesigned R1 vehicles, allowing it to remove 1.6 miles in wiring harness length and 44 pounds out of the vehicle. Rivian's software expertise is at the center of VW's plans to invest $5 billion in the automaker by 2026, including an anticipated joint venture between the companies to create electrical architecture and software technology. Volkswagen is expected to use Rivian's electrical architecture and software stack for vehicles beginning in the second half of the decade, Scaringe said during the investment announcement. He said the joint venture does not include anything with battery technologies, vehicle propulsion platforms, high voltage systems or autonomy and electrical hardware.

The retail pharmacy giant now expects fiscal 2024 adjusted earnings of $2.80 to $2.95 per share. That compares with the company's previous outlook of between $3.20 and $3.35 per share.

""'We assumed ... in the second half that the consumer would get somewhat stronger"" but ""that is not the case,"" Walgreens CEO Tim Wentworth told CNBC.

He added that ""the consumer is absolutely stunned by the absolute prices of things, and the fact that some of them may not be inflating doesn't actually change their resistance to the current pricing. So we've had to get really keen, particularly in discretionary things.""

Still, Walgreens topped revenue estimates for the quarter on strong performance in its health-care segment. The company views that business division as critical to its ongoing push to transform from a major drugstore chain into a large health-care company.

The results come as Walgreens works to slash costs after a rocky last year marked by low pharmacy reimbursement rates, weakening demand for Covid products and a challenging macroeconomic environment.

The company on Friday said it is simplifying its U.S. health-care portfolio and finalizing plans to close underperforming U.S. stores over multiple years, among other ongoing cost-cutting efforts.

""Seventy-five percent of our stores drive 100% of our profitability today,"" Wentworth said. ""What that means is the others we take a hard look at, we are going to finalize a number that we will close.""

Here's what Walgreens reported for the three-month period ended May 31 compared with what Wall Street was expecting, based on a survey of analysts by LSEG:

Earnings per share: 63 cents adjusted vs. 68 cents expected

63 cents adjusted vs. 68 cents expected Revenue: $36.4 billion vs. $35.94 billion expected

Walgreens booked sales of $36.4 billion for the quarter, up 2.6% from the same period a year ago.

The company reported net income of $344 million, or 40 cents per share, for the quarter. That compares with net income of $118 million, or 14 cents per share, for the same period a year ago.

Excluding certain items, adjusted earnings were 63 cents per share for the quarter.

The stock pared losses slightly to trade down 13% by 9:00 a.m. London time.

The world's second largest retailer said operating profit for the period between March and May came in at 7.1 billion Swedish kroner ($672 million), below the 7.37 billion Swedish kroner anticipated by analysts, according to an LSEG poll cited by Reuters.

The second-quarter result was nevertheless above the 4.7 billion Swedish kroner recorded in the same period last year.

The company also said that bad weather was likely to dampen sales in June, which it expects to decline by 6% in local currencies, compared with the same period of last year.

Further weighing on stock, H&M CEO Daniel Ervér cast doubt over the company's ability to meet its margin target this year.

""Our goal of an operating margin of 10 percent for full-year 2024 remains in place,"" he said. ""However, the conditions for achieving that level this year have become more challenging as it is assessed that external factors that influence our purchasing costs and sales revenues, including materials and foreign currency, will have a more negative impact than we expected in the second half of the year.""

He added that the company was continuing to invest in both its online and in store experiences, with upgrades to stores in Paris, Milan, Berlin, Stockholm, Hamburg and Munich to follow those already undertaken in New York, London and Tokyo.

It comes as higher living costs and a slowdown in post-pandemic spending have weighed on both high street and luxury retail sales.

Earlier this month, Zara owner Inditex reported a slowdown in first-quarter sales compared to the previous year's growth, but pointed to an uptick in May.

CNBC,https://www.cnbc.com/2024/06/26/micron-shares-slide-after-revenue-forecast-fails-to-top-estimates.html,2024-06-26,22:51:00 UTC,Micron shares slide after revenue forecast fails to top estimates,"Sanjay Mehrotra, Micron Technology President & CEO at the WEF in Davos, Switzerland on May 24th, 2022.

Micron shares fell about 7% in extended trading on Wednesday as investors looked past better-than-expected results and focused instead on a revenue forecast that was in line with estimates.

Here's how the company did versus LSEG consensus estimates for the fiscal third quarter ended May 30:

Earnings per share : 62 cents adjusted vs. 51 cents expected

: 62 cents adjusted vs. 51 cents expected Revenue: $6.81 billion vs. $6.67 billion expected

Micron, which makes computer memory and storage, said it expects adjusted earnings per share of $1.08 on revenue of $7.6 billion in the current quarter. Analysts were expecting earnings per share of $1.05 on revenue of $7.6 billion.

The shares have more than doubled in the past year as the company rides the artificial intelligence boom. Micron's most advanced memory is needed for AI graphics processing units (GPUs) like Nvidia's , putting the company in position to benefit from demand for technology to train and deploy AI applications like OpenAI's ChatGPT.

Micron reported $332 million in net income, or 30 cents per share, versus a net loss of $1.9 billion, or $1.73 per share, in the year-ago quarter.

Micron CEO Sanjay Mehrotra highlighted the company's AI business in a statement while saying that its smartphone and PC markets remain sluggish.

Mehrotra said the company's AI-oriented products were likely to increase in price and that the company's data center business grew 50% on a quarter-to-quarter basis.

""Robust AI-driven demand for data center products is causing tightness on our leading-edge nodes,"" Mehrotra said in a statement. ""Consequently, we expect continued price increases throughout calendar 2024 despite only steady near-term demand in PCs and smartphones.""

On a call with analysts, Micron said that its high bandwidth memory, the kind used in AI chips, is sold out through 2025.

""We believe that Micron will be one of the biggest beneficiaries in the semiconductor industry in the multiyear growth opportunity driven by AI,"" Mehrotra said.

CNBC,https://www.cnbc.com/2024/06/26/levi-levi-earnings-q2-2024.html,2024-06-27,09:17:32 UTC,Levi's shares drop 15% as jeans maker's sales disappoint despite denim craze,"Denim is having a moment with consumers, but it hasn't led to a major sales boost at Levi Strauss .

The jeans creator on Wednesday posted fiscal second-quarter revenue that fell just short of Wall Street's expectations at a time when shoppers are stocking their wardrobes with denim dresses, skirts and ultra low-rise baggy pants.

Levi's posted better-than-expected earnings as its direct sales to consumers and cost cutting continue to bear fruit. The company raised its dividend by 8% to 13 cents per share, its first increase in six quarters.

Still, shares fell about 15% in extended trading.

Here's how Levi's performed during the quarter compared with what Wall Street was anticipating, based on a survey of analysts by LSEG:

Earnings per share: 16 cents adjusted vs. 11 cents expected

16 cents adjusted vs. 11 cents expected Revenue: $1.44 billion vs. $1.45 billion expected

The company's reported net income for the three-month period that ended May 26 was $18 million, or 4 cents per share, compared with a loss of $1.6 million, or zero cents a share, a year earlier. Excluding one-time items, Levi's posted earnings of $66 million, or 16 cents per share.

Sales rose to $1.44 billion, up about 8% from $1.34 billion a year earlier. However, the sales jump was coming off of an easier comparison.

In the year-ago period, sales were down 9% after Levi's shifted its wholesale shipments from its fiscal second quarter into its fiscal first quarter. The shift reduced sales last year by about $100 million, the company said previously. Excluding the shift, as well as the exit of Levi's Denizen business, sales would have been up by only about 1% in its most recent quarter compared to the year-ago period.

Finance chief Harmit Singh attributed the sales miss to unfavorable foreign exchange conditions and weak sales at Docker's. During the quarter, the khaki and chinos brand saw $82.4 million in sales, up 8.6% from $75.8 million in the year ago period. It's not clear how sales at Docker's were affected by the timing of Levi's wholesale orders.

""People are generally cautious,"" Singh told CNBC in an interview. ""It's not necessarily an environment where people are buying a lot, people are cautious.""

While Levi's posted a strong earnings beat, it only reaffirmed its full-year guidance, which was in line with estimates. The company continues to expect full-year earnings per share to be between $1.17 and $1.27, which now includes a 5-cent hit coming from the company's new distribution and logistics strategy.

Levi's said it is transitioning from a primarily owned-and-operated distribution and logistics network in the U.S. and Europe to one that relies more on third parties.

""In the near term, these changes require the parallel operation of new and old facilities for the rest of 2024, resulting in a transitory increase in distribution costs,"" the company said.

The change allows Levi's to shift the responsibility of final mile delivery to third parties. The denim maker noted that it has new terms with its supplier that result in Levi's taking ownership of inventory closer to the point of shipment rather than its eventual destination. Levi's distribution network was built for a business that primarily sold to wholesalers, and now it needs to change into one that's more focused on selling directly to consumers.

The changes are necessary because nearly half of Levi's sales these days are coming from its own website and stores.

Direct-to-consumer sales jumped 8% during the quarter, representing 47% of overall sales. Online sales increased 19%.

""Our transformational pivot to operating as a DTC-first company is yielding positive results around the world, giving me great confidence that we will achieve accelerated, profitable growth for the rest of the year and beyond,"" CEO Michelle Gass said in a statement.

During the quarter, wholesale revenue grew 7%, but excluding the shift in timing of wholesale orders, sales in the channel decreased 4%. Singh noted that wholesale revenue improved on a sequential basis, but the company has a ""conservative"" view of the channel's growth moving forward.

By building out its own direct channels, Levi's enjoys higher profits, better data on its consumers and less reliance on shaky wholesalers like Macy's and Kohl's, which are continuing to shrink and fall out of favor with consumers.

However, selling directly can also be more expensive, and can come with unexpected hiccups that can impact sales and drain profits. For example, when someone buys a pair of Levi's from Macy's and wants to return them, Macy's typically bears that cost. Under a direct model, that responsibility, including the cost and logistics, would fall on Levi's.

Nike has come to be known as a cautionary tale for retailers long reliant on wholesalers that try to expand direct sales.

For a while, Nike's focus on direct sales boosted revenue and profits, but some critics said the strategy shift led to a slowdown in innovation, and ultimately, market share losses.

Recently, the company acknowledged that it erred when it cut off so many of its wholesale partners and said it has since ""corrected"" that.

It also said its unit expenses, excluding fuel, would be up as much as 7.5% over the year-earlier period and that capacity would still rise as much as 9% in that period, both unchanged from its previous forecast.

Southwest still expects record quarterly operating revenue in the second quarter.

Airlines are raking in record numbers of passengers but higher costs and growth in capacity have weighed on fares and profits.

Here's how the company did in its fiscal fourth quarter compared with what Wall Street was anticipating, based on a survey of analysts by LSEG:

Earnings per share : $5.41 adjusted vs. $5.35 expected

: $5.41 adjusted vs. $5.35 expected Revenue: $22.11 billion vs. $22.07 billion expected

The company reported net income for the three-month period that ended May 31 of $1.47 billion, or $5.94 per share, compared with $1.54 billion, or $6.05 per share, a year earlier.

Revenue rose to $22.1 billion, up slightly from $21.9 billion a year earlier. For the full fiscal year, revenue was $87.7 billion, down from $90.2 billion.

FedEx reported that capital spending for fiscal 2024 was $5.2 billion, down 16% from $6.2 billion in fiscal 2023 and less than the $5.7 billion it forecasted in its fiscal 2024 guidance last year.

For fiscal 2025, the company said it expects low to mid-single-digit revenue growth year over year, driven in large part by e-commerce and low-inventory levels, FedEx Chief Customer Officer Brie Carere said on the company's earnings call.

""We think e-commerce is going to outpace the B2B growth,"" Carere said. ""We like the fundamentals from an e-commerce perspective that will help us here in the United States and around the world.""

The capital spending decline comes as the company amps up its cost-cutting measures as part of a sweeping commitment to cut $4 billion by the end of fiscal 2025.

Following weak freight demand, FedEx enacted its DRIVE transformation program to cut costs and consolidate the business.

""DRIVE continues to change the way we work at FedEx. We achieved our target of $1.8 billion in structural costs out in fiscal year '24,"" CEO Raj Subramaniam said on the call.

Subramaniam said the company is firmly on track to achieve the $4 billion cost-cutting goal and further expects another $2 billion from the company's plans to consolidate its air and ground services.

As part of the DRIVE initiative, FedEx announced in April 2023 that it will be consolidating its delivery companies Express, Ground, Services and others into a unified Federal Express Corporation, operating under the FedEx brand and alongside the company's Freight segment which will continue to exist separately. The company said at the time that it expects the combined delivery business to handle all deliveries starting June 2024.

The newly combined segments are expected to be the larger driver of fiscal year 2025 adjusted income and margin improvement, finance chief John Dietrich said on the call.

FedEx further expects the demand environment to moderately improve through the next fiscal year, according to Carere.

Investor's eyes are also on the company's largest segment Express, which has been struggling with margin growth the past year. The segment's margins ended the fourth quarter at 4.1%, unchanged year over year. Its operating margin for fiscal 2024 was 2.6%, up slightly from 2.5% last year.

Subramaniam said improving performance of the Express segment is a ""top priority"" for the company.

While the company hiked its quarterly dividend by 10% earlier this month, investors do foresee headwinds, particularly after the company lost its U.S. Postal Service contract to rival United Parcel Service n April.

UPS will become the primary air cargo provider for USPS starting Sept. 30, after FedEx's contract expires. USPS was the largest customer for the company's Express segment. The company shared that it expects a $500 million headwind from the loss in fiscal 2025.","FedEx shares soared more than 15% after hours Tuesday after the company reported results that topped analysts' estimates in both earnings and revenue.

Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell joins a panel including his global counterparts Tuesday at a European Central Bank forum.

Powell will join ECB President Christine Lagarde and Brazil Central Bank Governor Roberto Campos Neto at the ECB Forum on Central Banking in Sintra, Portugal. CNBC's Sara Eisen will moderate. The forum happens with investors closely watching how central bank policymakers will react to inflation dynamics around the world.

In the U.S., the Powell-led Fed has kept its main policy rate steady for the past year despite inflation rates well off their mid-2022 peaks. Lagarde's ECB enacted a quarter-percentage-point cut that took its rate down to 4.25%, while Neto's bank cut by a quarter point in May to take its primary rate down to 10.5%.

Traders largely expect the Fed to start cutting in September with another reduction by the end of the year and quarterly moves lower through at least September 2025. However, Fed officials in June indicated they expect just one reduction this year.

The Financial Action Task Force, an international watchdog organization dedicated to combating money laundering and illicit cash flows, on Friday removed Turkey from its ""gray list"" of countries that need special monitoring, handing a major vote of confidence to the country in the midst of its economic turnaround efforts.

""The FATF welcomes Türkiye's significant progress in improving its AML/CFT regime,"" the Paris-based organization wrote in its latest report, using the Turkish government's spelling of its country's name and the acronym for anti-money laundering and combating the financing of terrorism.

It said that Turkey had strengthened the effectiveness of its AML/CFT regime to address ""deficiencies"" that FATF listed in its October 2021 monitoring report.

Those deficiencies included FATF concerns over unregistered money transfer services, insufficient resources dedicated to terrorist financing investigations, alleged involvement in sanctions evasion, lack of oversight on high-risk sectors used for money laundering such as banking and real estate, and insufficient oversight of nonprofit organizations that could be used for terrorist financing, among others.

In a lyric on her latest album, Beyoncé sings ""denim on denim, on denim, on denim."" Levi Strauss shoppers are taking that advice to heart. Levi Strauss executives are ecstatic. Western wear is booming as consumers opt for top-to-bottom denim looks, the iconic, 171-year-old clothing maker said on Wednesday. As the style wins cultural favor, its popularity is juicing denim niches — like shirts, skirts and dresses — that fall outside Levi's widely-known blue jean offerings. ""The growing popularity of Western wear is at an all-time high,"" CEO Michelle Gass told analysts Wednesday night after the California-based retailer's latest earnings report for the quarter ended in May. A Western renaissance has been gaining traction over the past several months, sending stylish shoppers searching for pieces like jeans, boots and cowboy hats. Levi's scored a huge hit when its jean brand was referenced in Beyoncé's song ""Levii's Jeans,"" released earlier this year. Beyond Beyoncé's chart-topping ""Cowboy Carter"" album, the increased ubiquity of Western style has also been tied to a fashion line unveiled by Louis Vuitton earlier this year and Taylor Swift's ongoing Eras Tour.

Gass, who took over as Levi Strauss CEO earlier this year after previously serving as the CEO at Kohl's , has touted that denim is having a moment in the popular imagination, with Western wear trending more broadly throughout the culture. More specific data shared on the company's earnings call Wednesday showed how Levi Strauss is taking advantage of demand for denim beyond its popular ""501"" jeans. Sales of denim skirts, jumpsuits and dresses all at least doubled in the latest quarter, Gass said. Western shirts sales are also up significantly, she said, especially on the women's side. Levi is find success in what the 55-year-old chief executive described as a new strategy of trying to dress customers denim — from head-to-toe. ""Our new focus is, yes, continuing to own jeans, but taking that denim top to bottom,"" Gass said on CNBC's ""Mad Money"" late Wednesday. While noting that the denim skirt and dress categories haven't been historically large for the company, now ""they're exploding,"" she said.

Denim rage sets a high bar on Wall Street

To be sure, the well-documented denim craze alone isn't necessarily impressing Wall Street. Levi Strauss tumbled more than 15% on Thursday in response to its latest numbers, its second worst day since going public in early 2019. Levi Strauss posted $1.44 billion in revenue in the fiscal second quarter, slightly missing the $1.45 billion consensus forecast of analysts polled by LSEG despite the denim boom. The company's finance chief told CNBC that the sales miss was driven by unfavorable foreign exchange rates and weakness in the Dockers brand. On the other hand, Levi Strauss earned 16 cents per share, excluding items, ahead of the 11-cent average estimate by analysts. In the year through Wednesday, shares had run up amid the buzz around the cotton-based fabric and the resurgence of Western clothing. Following Thursday's drop, the stock is still up more than 18% on the year. For comparison, shares of Kontoor Brands , the parent of denim brands Wrangler and Lee, have risen 5% year to date.

CNBC,https://www.cnbc.com/2024/06/28/may-pce-inflation-report.html,2024-06-28,19:35:23 UTC,"Key Fed measure shows inflation rose 2.6% in May from a year ago, as expected","Including food and energy, headline inflation was flat on the month and also up 2.6% on an annual basis. Those readings also were in line with expectations.

Both numbers were in line with the Dow Jones estimates. May marked the lowest annual rate since March 2021, which was the first time in this economic cycle that inflation topped the Fed's 2% target.

The core personal consumption expenditures price index increased just a seasonally adjusted 0.1% for the month and was up 2.6% from a year ago, the latter number down 0.2 percentage point from the April level, according to a Commerce Department report .

An important economic measure for the Federal Reserve showed Friday that inflation during May slowed to its lowest annual rate in more than three years.

""It is just additional news that monetary policy is working, inflation is gradually cooling,"" San Francisco Fed President Mary Daly told CNBC's Andrew Ross Sorkin during a ""Squawk Box"" interview. ""That's a relief for businesses and households who've been struggling with persistently high inflation. It's good news for how policy is working.""

The Fed focuses on the PCE inflation reading as opposed to the more widely followed consumer price index from the Labor Department's Bureau of Labor Statistics. PCE is a broader inflation measure and accounts for changes in consumer behavior, such as substituting their purchases when prices rise.

While the central bank officially follows headline PCE, officials generally stress the core reading as a better gauge of longer-term inflation trends.

Outside of the inflation numbers, the Bureau of Economic Analysis report showed that personal income rose 0.5% on the month, stronger than the 0.4% estimate. Consumer spending, however, increased 0.2%, weaker than the 0.3% forecast.

Prices were held in check during the month by a 0.4% decline for goods and a 2.1% slide in energy, which offset a 0.2% increase in services and a 0.1% gain for food.

However, housing prices continued to rise, up 0.4% on the month for the fourth straight time. Shelter-related costs have proven stickier than Federal Reserve officials have anticipated and have helped keep the central bank from reducing interest rates as expected this year.

Stock market futures were modestly positive following the report while Treasury yields were negative on the session.

Investors have been trying to handicap the Fed's intentions on rates this year and have had to scale back expectations. Whereas traders earlier in 2024 had been expecting at least six rate cuts this year they are now pricing in just two, starting in September. Fed officials at their June meeting penciled in just one reduction this year.

""The lack of surprise in today's PCE number is a relief and will be welcomed by the Fed,"" said Seema Shah, chief global strategist at Principal Asset Management. ""However, the policy path is not yet certain. A further deceleration in inflation, ideally coupled with additional evidence of labor market softening, will be necessary to pave the way for a first rate cut in September.""

The Fed targets 2% inflation and began raising interest rates in March 2022 after a year of dismissing rising prices as transitory effects from the Covid pandemic that likely would fade. The central bank last raised rates in July 2023 after taking its benchmark overnight borrowing level to a range of 5.25%-5.50%, the highest in some 23 years.

Recent economic data has painted a picture of an economy that has withstood the Fed's aggressive monetary tightening. Gross domestic product rose at a 1.4% annualized rate in the first quarter and is on pace to increase 2.2% in the second quarter, according to the Atlanta Fed.

There have been some slight cracks in the labor market lately, with continuing jobless claims hitting their highest level since November 2021. However, the unemployment rate is still 4%, low by historical means though also rising at a slow pace.","Including food and energy, headline inflation was flat on the month and also up 2.6% on an annual basis.

Here's what to expect,"People purchase beverages in a store on a sweltering afternoon in Brooklyn, New York, on the first day of summer on June 21, 2024.

The official Dow Jones forecasts for Friday's numbers are for the headline, or all-item, PCE price reading to come in flat on the month, while core is projected to rise 0.1%. That would compare to respective increases of 0.3% and 0.2% in April . Both headline and core are forecast at 2.6% on a year-over-year basis.

If that date rings a bell, it's when core PCE first passed the Fed's coveted 2% inflation target during this cycle. Despite a series of aggressive interest rate increases since then, the central bank has yet to wrest the pace of price increases back into its target range.

But even more importantly, when stripping out volatile food and energy prices, the core PCE price index, which draws even closer scrutiny from Fed policymakers, is set to indicate its lowest annual reading since March 2021.

The personal consumption expenditures price index, an inflation measure the Federal Reserve watches closely, is expected to show little, if any, monthly increase for May, the first time that would be the case since November 2023.

There could be some pretty good inflation news on the way from the Commerce Department when it releases a key economic report Friday.

Should the core PCE price forecasts transpire, it will serve as a milestone of sorts.

""We are in line with [the forecast] that the PCE core pricing data will come in soft,"" said Beth Ann Bovino, chief economist at U.S. Bank. ""That's good news for the Fed. It's also good for people's pocketbooks, although I don't know if people feel it just yet.""

Indeed, while the rate of inflation has receded precipitously from its mid-2022 peak, prices have not. Since that March 2021 benchmark, core PCE is up 14%.

That steep climb and its pernicious effect is why Fed officials are not ready to declare victory yet, despite the obvious progress made since the rate hikes began in March 2022.

""Returning inflation sustainably to our 2% target is an ongoing process and not a fait accompli,"" Fed Governor Lisa Cook said earlier this week.

Cook and her colleagues have been circumspect about the timing and pace of rate cuts, though most agree that easing is likely at some point this year as long as the data stays in line. Futures markets are currently pricing in a good likelihood that the Fed will enact its first quarter-percentage-point cut in September, with another to follow by the end of the year. Policymakers at their meeting earlier this month penciled in just one cut.

""We do expect softening in the real economy — not falling off a cliff, just softening — that suggests that inflation will be softer as well later on. That gives us reason to expect the Fed will be able to likely have their first cut in September,"" Bovino said.

""Now we all know it depends on the data and the Fed is still watching,"" she added. ""Could they wait? Could it just be a one and done this year? I can't rule it out. But it does look like the numbers might give the Fed cover to cut rates two times this year.""

In addition to the inflation numbers, the Commerce Department at 8:30 a.m. ET will release figures on personal income and consumer spending, with estimates at a rise of 0.4% and 0.3%, respectively.","If that date rings a bell, it's when core PCE first passed the Fed's coveted 2% inflation target during this cycle.

CNBC,https://www.cnbc.com/2024/06/30/top-wall-street-analysts-favor-these-dividend-stocks-for-better-returns.html,2024-06-30,10:55:21 UTC,Top Wall Street analysts favor these dividend stocks for better returns,"A sign is posted in front of an Olive Garden restaurant on June 20, 2024 in Rohnert Park, California.

Dividend-paying stocks can help investors bolster their portfolios and boost returns.

Investors searching for these names will need to find companies that have a track record of making steady payments, backed by robust financials.

Here are three attractive dividend stocks, according to Wall Street's top pros on TipRanks, a platform that ranks analysts based on their past performance.

Darden Restaurants

The first dividend stock is Darden Restaurants (DRI), which operates several popular brands in full-service dining, including Olive Garden, LongHorn Steakhouse and Yard House. The company recently announced mixed results for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2024. While Darden exceeded analysts' earnings expectations, its sales slightly missed the Street's consensus amid increased discounting by rivals.

Darden issued $628 million in dividends and committed $454 million to share repurchases in fiscal 2024. Moreover, the company announced a dividend hike of nearly 7%, bringing the quarterly dividend to $1.40 per share. The stock has a dividend yield of 3.5%.

Following the results, BTIG analyst Peter Saleh reiterated a buy rating on DRI stock with a price target of $175. The analyst highlighted that at the mid-point, Darden's earnings per share outlook of $9.40 to $9.60 indicates double-digit total shareholder return, which is in line with the company's long-term targets.

Saleh thinks that the company can achieve its targeted return metrics, supported by several factors, including a modest rise in pricing, advertising initiatives and easing inflation.

""We view Darden Restaurants as one of the strongest operators in the industry with historical sales and restaurant margin performance that has consistently exceeded peers,"" said Saleh.

Saleh ranks No. 360 among more than 8,900 analysts tracked by TipRanks. His ratings have been successful 61% of the time, with each delivering an average return of 11.7%. (See Darden's Financial Statements on TipRanks)

International Seaways

Next up is International Seaways (INSW), a tanker company that offers energy transportation services for crude oil and petroleum products. On June 26, the company paid a combined dividend of $1.75 per share. The company's combined dividend represented 60% of its first-quarter adjusted net income.

In its first-quarter results, INSW highlighted that its combined dividend payments of $5.74 per share over the last twelve months reflected a dividend yield of more than 13%.

Following meetings with INSW's management, Stifel analyst Benjamin Nolan reaffirmed a buy rating on the stock and increased the price target to $68 from $66. The analyst noted that the tanker market remains cyclically strong due to a continued increase in global oil consumption, the limited supply of new ships and the longer average voyage lengths caused by the ongoing geopolitical troubles.

Accordingly, Nolan increased his rate assumptions for 2024 and 2025. The analyst expects International Seaways to continue to deliver higher cash flows, fueled by a favorable backdrop for the tanker market.

Nolan expects INSW to sustain high supplemental dividends, given the estimated $200 million to $300 million of excess cash flow after capital expenditure (assuming there is no new debt associated with tanker acquisitions). ""We are modeling $5.51/share in 2024 dividends, although there is room to be a little higher,"" said the analyst.

Nolan ranks No. 68 among more than 8,900 analysts tracked by TipRanks. His ratings have been successful 67% of the time, with each delivering an average return of 19.5%. (See International Seaways' Stock Charts on TipRanks)

Citigroup

Finally, let's discuss this week's third dividend stock, banking giant Citigroup (C). At a quarterly dividend of 53 cents per share, Citigroup offers a yield of 3.3%.

The bank held its Services Investor Day on June 18. Management expressed confidence about achieving the 2024 guidance, driven by revenue growth across all the core businesses despite macro uncertainty and the possibility of lower interest rates.

Following the event, Goldman Sachs analyst Richard Ramsden reiterated a buy rating on Citigroup stock and slightly raised his price target to $72 from $71. The higher price target reflects an increase in the analyst's EPS estimates for 2024, 2025 and 2026 based on management's commentary, which indicated that the bank's strategic transformation plan is gaining momentum.

Ramsden noted that Citi is highly focused on its transformation efforts, with the bank making steady progress on risk control and data quality. Coming to the Services business, the analyst noted that management established strategic priorities for this vital component of the company's financial targets. The analyst estimates that the Services business will account for 25% of the group revenue growth through 2026.

""The Services business is well positioned to maintain their market leading positions with potential to continue share gains across businesses,"" said Ramsden. The analyst's optimism is based on Citi's extensive global network in 95 countries, well-established long-term client relationships, and market share gains that are expected to be driven by investments in technology and innovative offerings.

Ramsden ranks No. 969 among more than 8,900 analysts tracked by TipRanks. His ratings have been successful 65% of the time, with each delivering an average return of 11.9%.

CNBC,https://www.cnbc.com/2024/06/29/two-paths-for-jana-to-bolster-shareholder-value-at-rapid7.html,2024-06-29,11:55:40 UTC,Activist Jana has a stake in Rapid7. There are two paths to bolster value at the cybersecurity company,"Business: Rapid7 is a global cybersecurity software and services provider. Its products span across information security, cloud operations, development and information technology teams, enabling them to understand attackers and leverage that information to take control of their fragmented attack surface. Rapid7 Managed Threat Complete is the company's flagship offering, and it includes the Rapid7 Managed Detection and Response program. Rapid7 also provides risk and threat coverage through InsightIDR and Insight VM services, making them available in a single package. Its security solutions help more than 11,000 global customers unite cloud risk management and threat detection.

Activist Commentary: Jana is a very experienced activist investor founded in 2001 by Barry Rosenstein. The firm made its name taking deeply researched activist positions with well-conceived plans for long term value. Rosenstein called his activist strategy ""V cubed."" The three ""Vs"" were"" (i) Value: buying at the right price; (ii) Votes: knowing whether you have the votes before commencing a proxy fight; and (iii) Variety of ways to win: having more than one strategy to enhance value and exit an investment. Since 2008, the firm has gradually shifted that strategy to one which we characterize as the three ""Ss"" (i) Stock price: buying at the right price; (ii) Strategic activism: sale of company or spinoff of a business; and (iii) Star advisors/nominees: aligning with top industry executives to advise them and take board seats if necessary.

Rapid7 is a cybersecurity company that expands the expertise of its clients' security operations. Its Managed Threat Complete flagship offering combines end-to-end 24/7 managed detection and response with vulnerability management offerings. Historically, the company has focused on on-site cybersecurity operations, but it has begun to expand into the explosive growth area of cloud security. Rapid7 operates in a highly attractive industry and is the beneficiary of some meaningful tailwinds. In a time where software budgets are being cut or reallocated toward AI, the threat of cyberattacks looms large and presents a great enough risk that spend is either flat or increasing for these types of services. In addition, cybersecurity analysts and internal security staff are limited, so there is a tremendous need for outsourcing. With more complex operations and numerous applications both on-site and in the cloud, Rapid7 is well-positioned to continue growing and aims to be a high-quality provider for subject matter experts who may not be able to retain the services of their largest and most expensive competitors.

Despite its favorable position, the company has delivered negative returns on a one-, three-, and five-year basis. Rapid7 is one of three main players in vulnerability management, yet it's assigned a much smaller revenue multiple (3x) compared to peers Tenable (5.5x) and Qualys (8x). One factor in this is that Rapid7 offers a combination of low- and high-growth cybersecurity offerings, which is difficult to value, but more important are the multiple slip-ups by management, exacerbated by a lack of oversight by the board. First, the company has undergone changes to its sales model, including a shift to selling packaged products from selling offerings individually. It's also moved to a channel model from direct. Next, the company has encountered challenges in bringing its cloud product to market. In addition, to shift from pure growth to a profitable software company, Rapid7 has focused on meeting targets for $160 million in free cash flow and improved margins. In August 2023, likely in pursuit of these goals, the company abruptly announced plans to reduce its staff by 18%. Rapid7 has had further retention problems in key executive roles, including the departure of its chief innovation officer and its critically important chief operating officer and president. Finally, the company has not been able to properly make forecasts, leading to tremendous investor uncertainty and questions of board oversight. In February 2024, the company announced its 2024 guidance, which it stated it was highly confident in, only to cut it in May when the company delivered its Q1 results. That led to a 17% stock price decline on May 8. This is a company operating in a highly complex and dynamic space – it is doing everything all at once and has seemingly failed to deliver.

With a company like this, there are generally two paths to shareholder value creation: (i) a long-term plan involving board reconstitution, management overhaul and review of strategic and operational plans and (ii) a shorter-term plan to sell the company to an interested buyer who can make those changes. With respect to the long-term plan, Jana generally works with industry executives and consultants in performing due diligence and implementing its activist plans, and we do not expect this situation to be different. The firm will often bring these individuals to the table to serve as director nominees, if deemed necessary. Jana is experienced in getting these experts on company boards, where they often serve as assets in getting the company to correct its issues, from operational to governance to capital allocation. But Jana also has extensive experience in strategic activism and getting portfolio companies sold. We expect that Jana will advocate for the strategy it expects will maximize shareholder value on a risk- and time-adjusted basis. Given the problems the company has been experiencing and the lack of CEO focus (Aside from being chairman and CEO of Rapid7, Corey Thomas is on the National Security Telecommunications Advisory Committee, chair of the Federal Reserve Bank of Boston and a member of the Council on Foreign Relations. He also serves on the boards of the Blue Cross Blue Shield of Massachusetts, LPL Financial and Vanderbilt University.), a sale looks like it could be the easier and more certain path if there is a suitor at the right price.

Given industry tailwinds, there may be several strategic and financial buyers interested in this company. Recent transactions in the cybersecurity sector include Cisco's $28 billion takeover of Splunk and Francisco Partners' $1.7 billion acquisition of Sumo Logic. If Jana does advocate for a sale of Rapid7, it will ask the board to do it through a full sales process that attains the highest value for shareholders. In addition, Jana has a strategic partnership with Cannae Holdings, which could be helpful in providing the equity in a strategic transaction with a private equity firm. Consider that in 2019, Cannae joined with private-equity firms to buy Dun & Bradstreet. It is important to note that even if Jana thinks a sale of the company is the best way to optimize shareholder value, the firm will still have to get the board to agree. This does not look like a board and management team that will just go quietly. In such a case, Jana's remedy would be to launch a proxy fight, but that could take some time. The 2024 annual meeting just passed on June 13 and the director nomination window does not open until Feb.13, 2025.

CBN,https://www1.cbn.com/cbnnews/us/2024/july/want-to-connect-with-gen-z-invite-them-over-for-dinner,2024-07-02,20:02:49 UTC,Want to Connect with Gen Z? Invite Them Over for Dinner,"ANALYSIS

Gen Z is maturing within an unprecedented culture of media saturation. The entire world, via the internet, is available to them at all times on their smartphones.

And it’s not always a happy place, nor is it one that’s particularly easy to make sense of. As such, their relationship with media, with themselves — and with other people — is complicated in a number of ways we are still realizing.

But what if I told you they, just like us, crave and seek out the advice and consolation of trusted people in their real lives when they’re struggling? What if I told you that most prefer to connect face-to-face rather than through technology?

You might be surprised. After all, the mainstream depiction of Gen Z is often a teen endlessly scrolling on their phone, beset by depression and anxiety, falling slowly away from family and faith.

But that’s not what they’re like at all. According to recent data in The RELATE Project, the majority of Gen Z wants to talk to trusted parents, mentors, and friends when they’re struggling. Gen Z is seeking connection and intentional relationships. They are surprisingly grounded, community-oriented, prayerful, and intentional as a demographic.

Thankfully, breaking down the walls between Gen Z and older generations seems to be something anyone and everyone can do, if they choose. The adolescents interviewed for The RELATE Project were quick to express a desire for authentic, no-fuss dinner-table conversations, recognizing that such an environment lends itself towards engaging in meaningful discussions about life and what’s on their minds. Sharing life and authentic conversations—where both sides listen—also promotes relationship.

That means that any one of us can make a difference in the lives of Gen Z. Any one of us can open our homes to them, welcome them into our families, and invite them to share their lives, struggles, and joys at our side.

So invite them for dinner. Ask them to stay awhile. If we want them to flourish, we must unabashedly fling open the doors of our homes to the younger people in our midst, allowing them access to our dinner table, yes, but most importantly to our experiences, our lived wisdom, our relationship with God, our kindness, our time, and even our challenges.

Why? Because face-to-face interactions in an intimate, authentic setting can be the catalyst for a meaningful, long-term relationship of trust and respect. These relationships provide emerging adults with the tools – and the relationships – they need to thrive now and later on.

Of course, feeding them isn’t the only thing you need to do when they sit down at your table. The most important thing is to listen to them without judgment. They may not always want or even need our advice, but they do need us to actively listen – so be engaged and attentive. A simple “Tell me more,” “Go on,” or “What else?” shows that you are listening and creating space for those at your table to share with ease. Just as Kelly Corrigan advocates in her show Tell Me More, asking thoughtful questions leads to better connections and conversations.

My family made a practice of intentionally sharing our daily highs and lows at dinner. We found that, in doing so, we laid the groundwork for more complicated, personal, probing conversations — conversations that involved community concerns, faith, friendships, sorrows, and the future. These conversations were a tremendous gift to all of us, and I cherish the intimacy and authenticity we shared over those meals.

The kitchen table became a place to share the funny stories of our days, the struggles, and how we saw God showing up in our lives. I think our adult kids still feel safe to come to us now thanks in part to relationships built around the dinner table when they were young.

But this sense of safety, belonging, and trust shouldn’t be limited to our own children or immediate family. It can be extended to every person whose lives we touch, though it may look very different from home to home or from person to person.

You can, for instance, become the available parent or grandparent, the house where all the kids hang out after school, and create a space of hospitality – where all are welcome. Because it’s in those moments of carpooling, dishing out snacks, and opening your home after baseball or dance practice that opportunities arise to express that they are welcome, valued, and cared about — and that they belong.

Carving out time to build authentic relationships with Gen Z matters. They’ve told us they need us. They’ve told us how they need us. So let’s listen.

CBN,https://www1.cbn.com/cbnnews/2019/july/faith-of-our-fathers-god-and-the-american-revolution,2024-07-02,18:58:17 UTC,The Faith of Our Fathers: God and the American Revolution,"CBN.com - Many people are unaware of America's Judeo-Christian heritage. The following are short profiles of some of America's founding fathers, sharing their thoughts on how God's hand could be seen in the establishment of this nation.

John Adams

In June of 1776, John Adams was in Philadelphia, deep in the flurry of political activity. The Continental Congress appointed him, along with Thomas Jefferson and three others, to draft a ""Declaration of Independence"" from England. Although Adams was later to become the second president of the United States, he is best remembered for being one of the great minds and statesmen of the American Revolution. His prolific diaries, letters, and books provide an invaluable insight into the politics of the time and to what liberty meant to the founding fathers.

Freedom, Adams believed, did not rest solely on man. Instead, he wrote, ""It is religion and morality alone, which can establish the principles upon which freedom can securely stand ... the only foundation for a free constitution is pure virtues, and if this cannot be inspired into our people, in a greater measure, than they have it now, they may change their rulers, and the forms of government, but they will not obtain a lasting liberty"" (letter to cousin Zabdiel Adams, June 21, 1776).

John Adams would face another difficult situation as the second president of the United States in 1798. He had a hard act to follow -- the popular George Washington. Although he tried to avoid the trap of partisan politics, Adams soon found himself caught in its web. And if trouble at home wasn't bad enough, diplomatic relations with France were rapidly sinking. Adams prepared the American army and navy for defensive measures against France.

It was during this time that Adams spoke to the first brigade of the militia of Massachusetts, and re-affirmed the foundations for the American government:

""We have no government armed with power capable of contending with human passions unbridled by morality and religion,"" Adams said. ""Avarice, ambition, revenge, or gallantry would break the strongest cords of our constitution as a whale goes through a net. Our constitution was made only for a moral and religious people. It is wholly inadequate to the government of any other.""

Thomas Jefferson

Thomas Jefferson was just 33 years old when he was given the task of writing the Declaration of Independence. His knowledge of political philosophy, his eloquence as a writer, and his belief in natural rights made him a leader among the patriots.

But he was not without his political problems. Jefferson's opponents often portrayed him as an infidel and an atheist. But in reality, he was a staunch supporter of the freedom of religion and considered it a very personal matter -- one he often pondered in his writings. The man who gave us the immortal words ""when in the course of human events"" also gave us these reflections on God and his role in freedom. Etched in the marble of the Jefferson Memorial in his honor are these words:

""...God who gave us life gave us liberty. Can the liberties of a nation be thought secure when we have removed a conviction that these liberties are the gift of God? Indeed I tremble for my country when I reflect God is just, that his justice cannot sleep forever"" (from notes on the state of Virginia).

In the early 1780s, Jefferson was drafting a plan for future territories of the United States. Much of this plan became incorporated into the Northwest Ordinance of 1787, which established guidelines for territories applying for statehood. Under this law, any new states added to the nation would be recognized as equals with the original 13 states and not as colonies. The ordinance's provisions for the states included self-government, religious tolerance and the prohibition of slavery.

Jefferson's belief in the unquestionable relationship between good government and religious freedom is reflected in article three of the Northwest Ordinance, where he writes:

""Religion, morality and knowledge being necessary to good government and the happiness of mankind, schools and the means of education shall forever be encouraged.""

Noah Webster

Noah Webster's dictionaries, spellers, and grammars shaped the education of America in the 18th century and his legacy still lives on today. As the author of the first American dictionary and a son of the American Revolution, Webster sought to give the new country a different kind of freedom -- a culture of its own. Webster considered his most important project his revision of the King James Bible. He wanted to make it accessible to every American. He believed God played an important part in the education of the people and in the preservation of the American experiment.

Here is his advice on how to choose the nation's leaders:

""When you become entitled to exercise the right of voting for public officers, let it be impressed on your mind that God commands you to choose for rulers, just men who will rule in the fear of God. The preservation of a republican government depends on the faithful discharge of this duty; if the citizens neglect their duty, and place unprincipled men in office, the government will soon be corrupted"" (""Advice to the Young"" from Value of the Bible and Excellence of the Christian Religion, 1834).

Benjamin Franklin

Benjamin Franklin's role in drafting the Declaration of Independence was far from his first invention. This founding father contributed to America both in politics and in science. From almanacs and kite flying to serving as ambassador and statesman, Benjamin Franklin was truly one of the most versatile of America's founding fathers. Franklin's scientific mind also led to many intellectual and philosophical discussions.

Although he was not a regular church-goer in his adult life, he expressed the importance of implementing God's moral values in all aspects of life. His writings demonstrate an acknowledgment of God that transcended the scientific mysteries Franklin longed to answer. In 1731 he articulated a creed to live by, both personally and in public life:

""That there is one God, Father of the universe. That He is infinitely good, powerful, and wise. That He is omnipresent. That He ought to be worshipped, by adoration prayer and thanksgiving both in public and private.""

In the summer of 1787, delegates to the Constitutional Convention in Philadelphia had been in bitter debate for ten long weeks. Tempers flared over heated issues between the northern and southern states. As tensions rose, some delegates threatened to pull out of the convention altogether, leaving the fledgling nation without a strong constitution.

When it looked like no one would ever be able to agree, the elder statesman of the group took charge. The 81-year-old Franklin stood to his feet. And although he was not known to be devoutly religious, he gave this contentious gathering a stirring call for prayer.

""I have lived, sir, a long time, and the longer I live, the more convincing proofs I see of this truth, that God governs in the affairs of men. And if a sparrow cannot fall to the ground without His notice, is it probable that an empire can rise without His aid? ... I also believe that without His concurring aid we shall succeed in this political building no better, than the builders of Babel … Therefore, I beg leave to move that henceforth prayers imploring the assistance of heaven, and its blessings on our deliberations be held in this assembly every morning...""

Benjamin Rush

Benjamin Rush's impact on America did not stop with his signature on the Declaration of Independence. Although he was a member of the Continental Congress, Rush was also one of the most influential physicians in early America. He served as the Continental Army's Surgeon General during the American Revolution.

Under President John Adams, Rush was Treasurer of the United States Mint. More notably, the statesman encouraged support for building more African churches in Philadelphia. Rush was convinced this would reduce high black prison populations since many of the convicted served time for stealing food and clothing.

Benjamin Rush's advocacy reflected earlier writings of his beliefs in a strong religious and moral foundation for all people. In 1806 he wrote:

""The only foundation for a useful education in a republic is to be laid in religion. Without this, there can be no virtue, and without virtue, there can be no liberty, and liberty is the object and life of all republican governments.""

William Penn

Little did William Penn know that his vision of establishing a society that was godly, virtuous and exemplary for all would one day birth the freedoms of a nation. After establishing Pennsylvania with land granted by King Charles the second, Penn set out to plan a city called Philadelphia. Years later William Penn's historic city would become the first capital of the United States and out of it the nation's foundational structure would be laid.

Although Penn is best remembered for his vision of a democratic government and peaceful co-existence with the native Indians, in 1682, William Penn's beliefs of government fundamentals echo those of biblical principles:

""It is impossible, Penn wrote, that any people of government should ever prosper, where men render not unto God, that which is God's, as well as to Caesar, that which is Caesar's.""

James Wilson

One of the lesser-known patriots and founding fathers of our nation was Scottish-born James Wilson. The young lawyer's writings on the British Parliament's authority impressed members of the Continental Congress so much they elected him to the body in 1775. The following year, Wilson signed the Declaration of Independence and later the United States Constitution.

Serving as a United States Supreme Court Justice until his death, James Wilson realized there was a much higher law than man's to consider. When questioning what the ultimate cause of moral obligation is, Wilson determined, ""I give it this answer, the will of God. This is the supreme law. His just and full right of imposing laws, and our duty in obeying them, are the sources of our moral obligations.""

George Washington

In May of 1776, fighting was well underway in the American Revolution. For General George Washington it was a stressful time. Under his command in New York, he had about 7 thousand men. The rag-tag army was poorly trained. They were about to face some thirty thousand soldiers from the most highly trained and successful military force in the world. The Americans were outnumbered and outgunned. As they waited in New York for the onslaught of British military power, Washington issued orders for his troops to pray for the campaign ahead.

On May 17, 1776, he wrote that that day was, ""...to be observed as a day of fasting humiliation and prayer, humbly to supplicate the mercy of almighty God, that it would please Him to pardon all our manifold sins and transgressions, and to prosper the arms of the united colonies, and finally establish the peace and freedom of America upon a solid and lasting foundation.""

After the Revolution, Washington was elected America's first president. Years later, as he prepared to leave office and return to his beloved Mount Vernon, foremost in his mind was the need for the young nation to stay neutral on foreign issues until it grew stronger. George Washington chose to send this message to the nation in a farewell address -- not in a speech, but in the September 1796 Philadelphia newspapers. In it, the president advised Americans to value the newly formed republic and its constitution. But Washington cautioned that the country's success depended not only on national strength but also on two essential factors:

""Of all the dispositions and habits which lead to political prosperity, religion, and morality are indispensable supports.""

CBN,https://www1.cbn.com/cbnnews/us/2023/august/purveyors-of-human-pain-news-joins-with-border-sheriff-to-show-you-the-threat-to-america,2024-07-02,16:58:59 UTC,'We're the Frontline': CBN News Joins Border Sheriff to Show You the Threat to America,"SOUTHERN ARIZONA - In the scorching desert of Arizona, one local sheriff is waging war against cartels, human smugglers, and the drugs all crossing the border. CBN News visited the area with him to witness the crisis firsthand.

It might be 70 miles north of the Mexico-Arizona border, but Pinal County feels like the front lines of the fentanyl crisis. For years, cartels have used this route to smuggle illicit cargo north across the Tohono O'odham Indian Reservation. Since 2017, Pinal County Sheriff Mark Lamb has worked to stop it.

Sheriff Lamb told us, ""The reservation starts and then that reservation goes all the way into Mexico. It crosses over the border. So on both sides, you have Mexico and the United States. But the reservation is on both sides. And so they'll push through the reservation. And a lot of times members of that reservation will drive them up to the county line and drop them off.""

""And then what they do is they hike up to the I-8 or just on the other side to a place like where I'm going to show you now and then they'll load out their vehicle and take off.""

""And these are what you would call the 'Gotaways' or the people that get into the country undetected,"" he said.

CBN News rode along with Sheriff Lamb to see the scale of the problem.

""So mind you, I could probably show you 100 of these spots,"" he explained.

""And you see all the residue from the people here, the water jugs, the clothes, the blankets, the camouflage,"" he said. ""That orange twine is the remnants of marijuana. They use the burlap straps to put them to make a backpack. And then they'll use the twine to tie these two packs together.""

This vast desert poses a major challenge for Lamb and his deputies to police it all.

""This is a unique area. We actually have rip crews that will come in these areas and the rip crews are other drug dealers, other criminals that will come and steal the product from these loads whether it's marijuana, the fentanyl, the pills. But lately what they've been stealing and which has more value is humans. So if they're trafficking a load of ten people that are trying to come to America, the rip crews can come and steal them and then go up and extort them for money, put them into the sex trade, make them work for them, do all that,"" he explained.

The result is measured in human suffering.

""These poor people, when we find them, they're darn near dead, just from exhaustion, from what the cartels put them through,"" Sheriff Lamb said.

CBN News traveled to the edge of the Indian reservation, the Tohono O'odham Reservation that goes all the way down across the U.S.-Mexican border. There were piles of clothing everywhere at a drop-off point we observed. But these are not migrants. These are not people who are coming across looking for asylum.

We know this because the pile includes shoes made of carpet which masks footprints and the sound of walking. We discovered camouflage hats and jackets out here too. These are uniforms with the same hats, obviously purchased at the same place. It's the same kind of camouflage.

***Please sign up for CBN Newsletters and download the CBN News app to ensure you keep receiving the latest news from a distinctly Christian perspective.***

There were several of these camouflage backpacks also out here. This is what you would expect from a military invasion when people are wearing uniforms that are standardized. These are obviously being funded by the cartels. And instead of carrying weapons, what they're carrying into America is poison.

Lamb said, ""We're the frontline. And frankly, they're far more equipped if they decided to actually come over with guns and all their equipment. ...How much military weaponry can you buy with $13 billion a year? They are amassing armies, well, well-equipped armies in Mexico that are going to be very difficult to deal with.""

Sheriff Lamb believes the problem is as much the fault of the U.S. government as it is of the cartels. That's why this sheriff has decided to run for U.S. Senate in 2024.

Lamb said, ""This fight, the only way to get rid of these people is to vote them out or to impeach him. And so there is hope. The hope is that every two years we have elections. And this next election is a crucial election because if you don't like this stuff if you don't want these people flowing into America, we've got to get somebody back in there that believes in border security that's actually going to do it, and protect our communities and frankly, protect these people that are being taken advantage of by the cartels.""","Sheriff Lamb told us, ""The reservation starts and then that reservation goes all the way into Mexico.

On Tuesday, a coalition of groups announced the launch of the Platform Integrity Project, an effort to ensure the Republican Party Platform maintains its conservative ideals.

Listen to the latest episode of “Quick Start”

A press release from Family Research Council Action (FRC Action), a group that seeks to influence politicians on behalf of faith and family issues, notes the new effort aims to protect the “pro-life, pro-family, and pro-Israel” elements of the Republican Party platform.

FRC Action chairman Tony Perkins, an elected member of the Republican National Committee (RNC) Platform Committee, is at the helm of the Platform Integrity Project.

He exclusively explained the scope of the effort in a statement shared with CBN News.

“This coalition seeks to work with the RNC and the Trump campaign for an open process that will help ensure the preservation of the GOP’s solidly conservative platform that contains longstanding pro-life, pro-family, and pro-Israel planks,” the statement read. “This effort will, for the first time, score individual votes of platform delegates.”

The announcement comes amid concerns moderate Republicans could try to dilute the more conservative planks of the platform.

Perkins said party platforms are incredibly important as they highlight a party’s priorities and principles, with past data suggesting lawmakers tend to stick closely to the ideals in their associated platforms.

He added that FRC Action is teaming up with other groups like WallBuilders, Faith Wins, Family Policy Alliance, and Palmetto Family Council, among others, to launch the Platform Integrity Project and ensure clear and concise ideals are communicated about “life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness.”

“America is an unprecedented place of moral and cultural confusion and is in dire need of leadership and moral clarity,” Perkins said. “Voters need to see a contrast between the two parties on their policy priorities. Voters want and need a choice.”

He continued, “The message to Platform Committee delegates is clear: preserve life and family values in the Republican Party platform so that social conservatives can continue to find a home in the GOP.”

The Platform Integrity Project comes amid fears the Republican Party and Trump campaign could end up watering down or removing some of the more conservative ideals in the GOP platform.

This is particularly pronounced in the wake of the Dobbs decision, which overturned Roe v. Wade and returned abortion laws to the states. This will be the first party platform that must contend with the new realities surrounding the Supreme Court’s monumental move.

Perkins’ campaign is imploring people to sign up and encourage delegates and officials who will be meeting July 8-9 to draft the new GOP Party Platform to stand by traditional party values.

“May God give them wisdom and discernment as they meet, evaluate important ideas, and vote on policies,” text on the Platform Integrity Project website reads. “May they have great understanding and clarity as they address the critical and sometimes complex issues facing our nation.”

Listen to the latest episode of “Quick Start”

Richard Malinga’s body was discovered June 17 in a pool of blood and “tied with ropes,” according to a resident who spoke with Morning Star News on condition of anonymity.

“I heard a loud wailing at around 7:30 p.m. on the main road between Butebo and Alodot village near Kayete Swamp in Akisim A village situated in Butebo District,” the individual said. “We dashed to the scene and found the victim in a pool of blood.”

Malinga, 36, had reportedly received death threats from Islamic extremists before his slaughter. He had also texted his pastor that he had been surrounded by Muslims.

The group’s anger might have been sparked by the evangelist’s success in the Butebo District, where he preached door-to-door, to convert Muslims to Christianity.

The pastor he texted detailed some of this to Morning Star News.

“The evening of June 17, I received a short message from Malinga of being surrounded by the Muslims,” the preacher said. “I wrote back to him several times, but there was no response.”

The local resident who found Malinga’s body reportedly found his phone and called the pastor, who then informed the police about the murder.

Authorities are reportedly investigating the killing as friends and loved ones mourn.

“We as a church are very saddened for losing our active, devoted, and committed evangelist who won many people, including Muslims, to Christianity,” the preacher said.

According to Voice of the Martyrs, Uganda is a majority Christian nation, but Islamic extremism is still at work within its borders. This has led to discrimination, persecution, and other chaos. These issues are particularly problematic for Muslims who convert to Christianity.

“Radical Islam’s influence has grown steadily, and many Christians within the majority Muslim border regions are facing severe persecution, especially those who convert from Islam,” the persecution watchdog notes. “Despite the risks, many churches in Uganda have responded by reaching out to their neighbors; many churches are training leaders how to share the Gospel with Muslims and care for those who are persecuted after they become Christians.”

As CBN News previously reported, Twaha Namwoyo, 38, and Nadiimu Katooko, 27, were a husband and wife and the parents of four children in the Ugandan village of Bulalaka. They were killed earlier this year just two months after converting to Christianity. Read more about their story here.

President Biden condemned it as a ""dangerous precedent.""

Former President Trump called it a ""big win for the Constitution.""

In addition to its historical impact, the ruling also affects an election interference case against Trump.

For the first time in its 235-year history, the court clarified the issue of presidential immunity, ruling 6-3 that presidents have absolute immunity for official acts and presumptive immunity for official actions taken outside the parameter of the explicit duties of the office.

President Trump brought the case to the high court, contending he had absolute immunity from criminal charges based on his official acts as president on January 6, 2021.

""You're not going to do anything (as president) if you don't have immunity because otherwise, you're going to be prosecuted after you leave office,"" he said.

A majority of the justices agreed.

Chief Justice John Roberts delivered the court's opinion: ""The nature of presidential power entitles a former president to absolute immunity from criminal prosecution for actions within his conclusive and preclusive constitutional authority. And he is entitled to at least presumptive immunity from prosecution for all his official acts. There is no immunity for unofficial acts.""

""The court, in a rather complicated way, carved out various levels of immunity that a president might enjoy,"" said Claire Wofford, Associate Professor of Political Science at the College of Charleston.

Immediately after the ruling was announced, Trump posted on Truth Social: ""Big win for our Constitution and democracy. Proud to be an American!""

In an address to the nation on Monday night, President Biden claimed the ruling means there are no limits on what a president can do.

""This is a fundamentally new principle and it's a dangerous precedent,"" he said. ""Because the power of the office will no longer be constrained by the law, even by the Supreme Court of the United States. The only limits will be self-imposed by the president alone.""

The ruling kicks the January 6th case down to the U.S. federal District Court and it puts the burden on Special Prosecutor Jack Smith to prove the former president acted unofficially and with criminal motivation as a candidate for president.

That will be hard to prove because the Supreme Court said his contacts with the Department of Justice and Vice President Pence to overturn the election took place as official acts within the president's authority.

When Trump's lawyers presented arguments before the court last April, Justice Sonya Sotomayor asked if there should be any limits on presidential actions. ""If the president decides his rival is a corrupt person and he orders the military or orders someone else to assassinate him, is that within his official acts for which he can get immunity?""

Justices Kagan and Jackson agreed with Sotomayor voting against the majority's decision.

In the dissent, Sotomayor wrote: ""Today's decision to grant former presidents criminal immunity reshapes the institution of the presidency. It makes a mockery of the principle, foundational to our Constitution and system of government, that no man is above the law...the court gives former President Trump all the immunity he asked for and more.""

Legal experts agree this unprecedented, historic ruling will have far-reaching implications not only for Donald Trump but for future presidents as well.



It also means Jack Smith's January 6th case against the former president will likely be delayed until after the November election.

And President Trump is now citing the ruling in an attempt to overturn his conviction in New York last month, despite those acts being committed before he was president.

But many of the terrorists have escaped, and he acknowledges the IDF will have to keep chasing them down all over Gaza.

As Netanyahu puts it, “We are nearing the end of the elimination phase of Hamas’s terrorist army. There will be a continuation of hitting its remnants.”

Netanyahu added he expects to achieve the war's goals, “To return our hostages, to eliminate the military and governmental capabilities of Hamas, to ensure that Gaza does not pose a threat, and even more than that to return our residents both in the south and in the north safely to their homes.”

Had to Evacuate Six Times

The IDF has destroyed much of Khan Younis, a huge suburb of Rafah, in earlier pitched battles to wipe Hamas out there. But many of the surviving terrorists have recently fled from Rafah to Khan Younis. So the IDF is having to order the civilians there -- many who are already evacuees from other areas – to evacuate once again so they don't get mowed down in the renewed fighting.

One bedraggled and angry woman said as she fled with her family, ""Here we are going to look for a place to evacuate to. I've been displaced six times from Rafah.""

It appears the Biden administration continues to demand how the Israelis should conduct this war. With so much of Gaza bombed and in ruins, it's thought many Palestinians living there might well be better off moving elsewhere. But the U.S. is telling Israel it must eventually let all Gazans settle back permanently in Gaza.



As State Department spokesperson Vedant Patel stated, ""There can be no permanent displacement of Gazans.""

What the Biden Administration Finds Unacceptable

And the Biden administration is saying the Israelis must make sure after the war there is an Arab-led civilian government set up in Gaza. Some in the Jewish nation think it can't really be safe from Gaza unless there's some form of Israeli occupation to make sure terrorists can't rise to power again there.

But U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken insists anything less than Arabs back in charge is one of three things unacceptable to the Biden administration.

He states, ""We know that there are three things that are unacceptable for Gaza's future. An Israeli occupation, Hamas perpetuating its leadership, or chaos, anarchy, lawlessness - which is what we're seeing in big parts of Gaza today.""



At the same time Blinken is dictating to Israel what is or is not acceptable, he also has harsh words for Hamas leader Yahya Sinwar and his refusal to say ""yes"" to a ceasefire that could bring hostages home and end the violent war.

Blinken explained, ""Right now, in not saying yes, Mr. Sinwar is not only holding on to the Israeli, American and other hostages, he's continuing to make a hostage of Palestinian children, women, and men, who are caught in a horrific crossfire of Hamas' making.""

War Between Israel and Hezbollah

Blinken also addressed the possibility of war between Israel and Hezbollah saying, “On the one hand, no one wants a war. On the other hand, you have forces, momentum that may be leading in that direction, in which we are determined to try to arrest.

Blinken noted about the thousands of Israeli evacuees, ""You have 60,000 or so Israelis out of their homes in northern Israel. Israel has essentially lost sovereignty in that part of the country because people don’t feel safe going to their homes.”

Suing Iran, Syria & North Korea for $4,000,000,000

Victims who survived Hamas' brutal assault on Israel on October 7th are suing Iran, Syria, and North Korea for four billion dollars. They accuse those countries of giving Hamas the money, weapons, and other assistance that made the deadly October 7th attack possible.

Anti-Defamation League Director Jonathan Greenblatt announced the legal action, “This lawsuit on behalf of more than a hundred Americans who are affected by this attack will indeed ensure that there are consequences to be brought for the bloodiest day experienced by the Jewish people since the Holocaust.”

On another front, Prime Minister Netanyahu has publicly rejected the Palestinian Authority having a role in ruling Gaza after the war. Many Israelis feel the PA – just like Hamas – wants to see the Jewish nation destroyed and is fomenting that in Judea and Samaria, the so-called West Bank. But it appears Netanyahu may be softening a bit and ready to let lower-level PA workers take part in governing Gaza. Yet that would be only as long as they've been thoroughly vetted by Israel first.

Rescued Daughter at Mother's Side

In sad news, Liora Argamani, the mother of Noa Argamani, passed away. Liora suffered from terminal brain cancer and had hoped to see her daughter Noa before she died. Hamas terrorists kidnapped Noa from the Nova Music Festival, and she spent eight months in captivity before being rescued by IDF special forces in a daring raid last month. The rescue allowed Noa to be with her mother during Liora's last days.","JERUSALEM, Israel – Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu argues that the Israeli Defense Forces are destroying Hamas' ability to strike as an army.

Comfort, known for his viral videos and engaging Gospel-sharing, recently sent a gift basket to the civil rights group after the organization sued Lousiana over its decision to become the first U.S. state to mandate the Ten Commandments be displayed in public school classrooms.

Listen to the latest episode of “Quick Start”

Rather than deride the ACLU, Comfort offered a “thank you” for giving massive and renewed cultural attention to the famed biblical commandments.

“The ACLU, in wanting to sue the state of Louisiana, have done us a great favor,” he told CBN News. “Their lawsuit was big news in the secular media, and so the Ten Commandments have featured from Newsweek to Time magazine, USA Today, to The New York Times, CNN, MSNBC, NBC, ABC, Fox, on huge podcasts, ‘The View,’ all throughout social media, and comedian Jimmy Kimmel even quoted all of the Ten Commandments to his massive viewing audience. You can’t buy that sort of publicity!”

Considering this inadvertent “gift,” Comfort decided to send the ACLU a large basket filled with chocolate and a thank-you card.

That card included a message that read, “Thank you for publicizing The Ten Commandments. America needs to be reminded of God’s Law, and you’ve certainly done that. Very grateful.”

The ACLU reportedly hasn’t responded to the gesture and note, but Comfort said he doesn’t expect the organization to do so. Comfort has long advocated for Christians — and humans more generally — to pay attention to the Ten Commandments and implement these moral truths into their lives.

He told CBN News that Americans today can learn a great deal by studying biblical Israel and understanding its timeless parallels to our current situation.

“America is no different than Israel in the Old Testament who forgot the Ten Commandments, and consequently gave themselves to sin,” Comfort said. “And the reason they did so was because of the sin of ‘idolatry.'”

He continued, “When we forsake the Law that forbids making up false gods and committing adultery, we tend to make up our own congenial image of God and run headlong into sexual sin. And that’s what’s happened to the United States.”

Comfort believes the only catalyst for awakening Americans to their national sin is a “fresh look at the Ten Commandments.” In fact, Comfort’s ministry, Living Waters, has spent four decades teaching Christians about the importance of the Ten Commandments and equipping them to share the Gospel.

Comfort said he would love to see every school in the U.S. display the Ten Commandments, but noted he believes too many people are “brainwashed into believing in the fallacy of ‘separation of church and state.'”

As CBN News previously reported, the ACLU is suing after Louisiana Republican Gov. Jeff Landry signed H.B. 71 into law, meaning every classroom from kindergarten to the university level, which receives state funding, would be required to display the commandments “on a poster or framed document that is at least 11 inches by 14 inches.”

The effort, slated to be privately funded, will require a poster-sized display accompanied by a four-paragraph explanation offering context. The text will note that the Ten Commandments “were a prominent part of American public education for almost three centuries.”

These classroom posters are due to be posted by the start of 2025.

The ACLU, its Lousiana branch, the atheist-led Freedom From Religion Foundation, Americans United for Separation of Church and State, and nine Lousiana families joined forces to challenge the law. CBN News will continue to cover the case as it unfolds.

Most recently, Living Waters released the “Trump/Biden Million Dollar Bill,” a free tract leading up to the U.S. election in November. It can be ordered here.

These Horrific Weather Events from Long Ago Tell the True Story,"Is This a Climate Emergency? These Horrific Weather Events from Long Ago Tell the True Story

The phrase ""extreme heat"" is being used over and over in news coverage as if to signal that a climate emergency has arrived.

We're told 2023 is on track to be the hottest year on record, while two-thirds of Americans in a PBS/Marist Poll now say climate change is affecting the weather.

Denver resident Mike Barela said, ""People are starting to realize that there is an effect."" Miami resident Stephen Escudero said, ""This definitely feels like we're in that point of no return that people have talked about for a long time.""

Some have called on President Biden to declare a 'climate emergency' amid searing summer temperatures. And UN Secretary-General António Guterres has called for immediate action on climate change, saying, ""The era of global warming has ended; the era of global boiling has arrived.""

Weather history, however, tells a different story – that the worst weather events, including the hottest years, have all been in the past.



The worst hurricane in history? The Great Hurricane of 1780, which killed over 20,000 people in the Caribbean.



The worst wildfire in U.S. history? The Peshtigo Fire in Wisconsin in 1871 killed at least 1,500 people and burned over a million acres.

The worst flood in world history was in 1931 – the Yangtze River Flood in China, which killed almost 4 million people.

The worst flood in U.S. history was in 1889, in Johnston, Pennsylvania.



The deadliest tornado in recorded U.S. history was in 1925. The Tri-State Tornado, which struck Missouri, Illinois, and Indiana, killing some 700 people.

And the hottest year was not 2023, but 1936. In 1936, 21 states had their all-time temperature records.



Steve Milloy of Junkscience.com said, ""We know in the United States that the 1930s were extremely hot – 1936 is the hottest year on record in the United States and probably throughout the northern Hemisphere.""

Some northern cities saw temperatures between 115 and 120 degrees that year. Many thousands died across the country and the resulting Dust Bowl forced the migration of 3 and half million climate refugees out of the Great Plains and Midwest.

There is no dispute that the Earth has been warming incrementally since an extremely cold period known as Little Ice Age ended in 1850.



But Weatherbell Chief Forecaster Joe Bastardi blames this summer's sweltering temperatures on a huge amount of water vapor created by an immense underwater volcanic eruption in Tonga last year that was 1,000 times more powerful than the nuclear bomb dropped on Hiroshima, and by warming oceans.

Bastardi told us, ""There's been an increase in what we call geothermal spreading since the early 1990s. And what it does is it develops a cumulative buildup of heat in the oceans, which then has to be released through the El Ninos, which then puts all sort of water vapor in the air, which then leads to the warming that you're seeing. It's all water vapor.""



There have also been record-breaking cold temperatures this summer, but that weather news is ignored.

Florida Governor Ron DeSantis reminded reporters Sunday that while Hurricane Idalia was very damaging, it paled in comparison to the Category 5 Labor Day storm of 1935, which had peak winds of 200 miles per hour and killed more than 400 people.

“There were people that got caught up in the storm that their clothes got ripped off their bodies, that the wind was so strong. So I think that the notion that somehow, hurricanes are something new that's just false and, and we've got to stop politicizing the weather and stop politicizing natural disasters,"" DeSantis said at a post-hurricane press conference.

Milloy says, ""It's a very complicated issue that the alarmists just like want to boil down to 'fossil fuel use is destroying the planet.' The whole climate is a lot more complicated.

A U.S. district court has ruled that CEF Bible clubs must be provided equal opportunity as other clubs throughout the island state.

Liberty Counsel filed the case against the Hawaii State Department of Education after the continual rejection of Good News Club over a span of three years.

VICTORY! We received a preliminary injunction on behalf of Child Evangelism Fellowship of Hawaii and its Good News Clubs for after school Bible clubs to be given equal access as similarly situated clubs on public school campuses across Hawaii. See morehttps://t.co/pGXN8hhXK8 — Liberty Counsel (@libertycounsel) June 28, 2024

CBN News reported previously that CEF Hawaii had submitted applications to host Good News Clubs in several schools, including Nu'uanu Elementary, Lincoln Elementary, Waimea Elementary, Kalihi Waena Elementary, Kohala Elementary School, and Pearl City Elementary. All submissions were continually denied by the state's Department of Education (DOE).



While the Hawaii DOE argued that the prohibition of these clubs was based on ""misappropriation of school policies,"" CEF argued that their decision reflected ""blatant religious discrimination.""



In a reply brief filed back in April, the legal organization explained that the department chose ""silence"" over correcting ""unequal and unconstitutional treatment"" by its own officials.



The awarded preliminary injunction serves as a big win for religious freedom within schools in Hawaii.

Liberty Counsel Founder and Chairman Mat Staver said, ""This is a great victory for Child Evangelism Fellowship, parents, and the students in Hawaii public schools. The U.S. Supreme Court has ruled that public schools cannot discriminate against Christian viewpoints regarding use of school facilities. Child Evangelism Fellowship gives children a safe space that offers moral and character development from a Christian viewpoint. Good News Clubs should be in every public elementary school.""

Good News Clubs, which meet weekly, are led by community volunteers. These clubs encourage learning, service, and spiritual growth while also existing to help develop a child's social skills, leadership skills, emotional well-being and character.

CBN,https://www1.cbn.com/cbnnews/world/2024/july/beryl-makes-landfall-as-category-4-hurricane-on-caribbean-island,2024-07-01,18:27:02 UTC,Beryl Makes Landfall as Category 4 Hurricane on Caribbean Island,"SAN JUAN, Puerto Rico (AP) - A dangerous and extremely powerful Hurricane Beryl made landfall Monday on the Caribbean island of Carriacou after becoming the earliest storm of Category 4 strength to form in the Atlantic, fueled by record warm waters.

Winds up to 150 mph (240 kph), just shy of a Category 5 storm, blew off roofs, uprooted trees and caused other damage on Carriacou, one of the islands of Grenada, and elsewhere in the southeast Caribbean.

“This is an extremely dangerous and life-threatening situation,” the National Hurricane Center said.

Hurricane warnings were in effect for Barbados, Grenada, Tobago and St. Vincent and the Grenadines as thousands of people hunkered down in homes and shelters. The last strong hurricane to hit the southeast Caribbean was Hurricane Ivan 20 years ago, which killed dozens of people in Grenada.

NBC Radio in St. Vincent and the Grenadines said it received reports of roofs being torn off churches and schools as communications began collapsing across the southeast Caribbean.

In nearby Grenada, officials received “reports of devastation” from Carriacou and surrounding islands, said Terence Walters, Grenada’s national disaster coordinator. Prime Minister Dickon Mitchell said he would travel to Carriacou as soon as it’s safe, noting that there’s been an “extensive” storm surge.

Grenada officials had to evacuate patients to a lower floor after hospital roof was damaged, he said.

“There is the likelihood of even greater damage,” he told reporters. “We have no choice but to continue to pray.”

Later on Monday morning, Beryl was about 30 miles (50 kilometers) north of the island of Grenada, moving west-northwest at 20 mph (31 kph).

In Barbados, officials received more than a dozen reports of roof damage, fallen trees and downed electric posts across the island, said Kerry Hinds, emergency management director. Wilfred Abrahams, minister of home affairs and information, said drones - which are faster than crews fanning across the island - would assess damage once Beryl passes.

A tropical storm warning was in effect for St. Lucia, Martinique and Trinidad. A tropical storm watch was issued for Haiti’s entire southern coast, and from Punta Palenque in the Dominican Republic west to the border with Haiti. A hurricane watch was issued for Jamaica.

Forecasters warned of a life-threatening storm surge of up to 9 feet (3 meters) in areas where Beryl made landfall, with 3 to 6 inches (7.6 to 15 centimeters) of rain for Barbados and nearby islands and possibly 10 inches in some areas (25 centimeters), especially in Grenada and the Grenadines.

The storm was expected to weaken slightly over the Caribbean Sea on a path that would take it just south of Jamaica and later toward Mexico’s Yucatan Peninsula as a Category 1.

“Beryl is forecast to remain a significant hurricane during its entire trek across the Caribbean region,” the National Hurricane Center said.

Officials in some southeast Caribbean islands announced controlled power outages and warned of water cuts ahead of the storm, as well as landslides and flash floods. Schools, airports and government offices shuttered.

Beryl strengthened from a tropical depression to a major hurricane in just 42 hours - a feat accomplished only six other times in Atlantic hurricane history, and with Sept. 1 as the earliest date, according to hurricane expert Sam Lillo.

It also was the earliest Category 4 Atlantic hurricane on record, besting Hurricane Dennis, which became a Category 4 storm on July 8, 2005.

“This is a dangerous hurricane for the Windward Islands,"" said hurricane specialist and storm surge expert Michael Lowry. Beryl amassed its strength from record warm waters that are hotter now than they would be at the peak of hurricane season in September, he said.

Beryl is the second named storm in the Atlantic hurricane season, which runs from June 1 to Nov. 30. Earlier this month, Tropical Storm Alberto made landfall in northeast Mexico and killed four people.

The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration predicts the 2024 hurricane season is likely to be well above average, with between 17 and 25 named storms. The forecast calls for as many as 13 hurricanes and four major hurricanes.

An average Atlantic hurricane season produces 14 named storms, seven of them hurricanes and three major hurricanes.

While the court did issue some major rulings about immunity, the justices chose not to rule directly in Trump's specific case, kicking it back down to the lower courts. That move will delay special counsel Jack Smith's criminal case against Trump, likely pushing it until after the November election.

In its Trump v. United States ruling, the high court said the lower courts simply hadn't finished the job yet.

Chief Justice John Roberts explained, ""The lower courts rendered their decisions on a highly expedited basis"" and ""did not analyze the conduct alleged in the indictment to decide which of it should be categorized as official and which unofficial,"" according to SCOTUSblog.

Historic Ruling on Presidential Immunity

The Supreme Court did make several statements about immunity that those lower courts will need to apply to Trump’s case.

In a historic ruling, the justices declared that former presidents have absolute immunity from prosecution for their official acts based on core constitutional powers. But they also declared, ""There is no immunity for unofficial acts.""

Trump has claimed that he acted in his official duties as president when he challenged the certification of the 2020 election on January 6 and should be immune from prosecution.

It's not entirely clear how the ruling will affect the Jack Smith case, but the decision has been widely labeled as a victory for Trump in the broader sense.

""It's a very big win for former President Trump. Recognizing for the first time this sort of immunity of ex-presidents from criminal prosecution,"" said Prof. Kate Shaw of the University of Pennsylvania Carey Law School.

Before the ruling, Bradley Jacob, Associate Dean at Regent University Law School, predicted Donald Trump's criminal trials likely will not be dismissed.

""Maybe a few of the allegations, a few of the indictments will be thrown out. But by and large, I think you're going to see continued movement towards the trials of President Trump, but probably not fast enough to reach any conclusions before the election,"" Jacob said.

Officers with the Irving Police Department said in the aftermath of the attack that they do not believe the double homicide was a random act of violence. Rather, they said, it was a “targeted” assault. And the suspect, identified as 37-year-old Oved Bernardo Mendoza Argueta, fled the scene before officers arrived, KXAS-TV reported.

Once police arrived on the scene, they pronounced two victims dead inside the restaurant.

Mendoza Argueta reportedly fled the scene in a 1997 Honda four-door sedan. He is married to a Chick-fil-A employee who witnessed the crime and identified her husband to authorities. Mendoza Argueta was captured by police in the early morning hours Thursday and booked in the Irving City Jail.

Listen to the latest episode of “Quick Start”

He has been charged with capital murder.

The alleged perpetrator was swiftly placed on an immigration detainer by the U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement, which means ICE intends to take custody of the assailant.

A spokesperson for ICE told the New York Post that its Enforcement and Removal Operations in Dallas “lodged an immigration detainer with the Irving Police Department” regarding Mendoza Argueta.

“Our hearts are broken by the tragedy that unfolded inside our restaurant Wednesday,” the local Chick-fil-A franchise owner said in a statement. “We will miss our two team members dearly. Right now, our focus is on providing care for our team and the victims’ families.”

News of the killing comes as President Joe Biden and former President Donald Trump sparred in Thursday night’s debate over illegal immigration and trouble at the U.S.-Mexico border,” which the presumptive Republican presidential nominee described as “the most dangerous place anywhere in the world.”

“When he was president, he was … separating babies from their mothers, put him in cages, making sure that the families were separated,” said Biden, according to CBN News. “That’s not the way to go.”

Trump retorted, “We have the largest number of terrorists coming into our country right now. All terrorists all over the world, not just in South America, all over the world. They come from the Middle East, everywhere, all over the world. … And this guy just left it open.”

When we feel stressed out, depressed, or otherwise unhappy, many of us tend to reach for comfort foods like ice cream, macaroni and cheese, or fried chicken, to feel better. Doctors say while these dishes stimulate the pleasure center in our brains giving us instant satisfaction, in the long run, they can actually harm our mental health.

Sugar is the Enemy

Psychiatrist Daniel Amen, author of Change Your Brain Every Day, told CBN News our diet plays a major role in how well our brain functions. The types of foods and drinks we consume directly contribute to the way we think and feel through a complex system of neurotransmitters, hormones, and more.

""Sugar is the enemy of brain health,"" Dr. Amen said. ""Sugar is pro-inflammatory, and inflammation is clearly associated with depression.""

Dr. Amen says good mental health begins with minimizing the consumption of junk foods like sugary, processed foods and drinks that are loaded with chemical additives and lack fiber and other nutrients.

""We reach for things that help us feel better now, but not later,"" he said.

Dr. Amen said a brain-healthy diet consists of 70% fruits and vegetables and 30% good protein, like pasture-raised chicken and healthy fats like salmon and olive oil.

""Brain and mental health, just like spiritual health, is a daily practice,"" he said.

The Gut-Brain Connection

Psychiatrist UmaNaidoo, author of This is Your Brain on Food: An Indispensable Guide to the Surprising Foods that Fight Depression, PTSD, ADHD, Anxiety, OCD, and More, told CBN News the brain and the intestines are linked by the vagus nerve.

""These two organ systems start from the exact same cells in the human embryo. And so they are inextricably connected throughout our lives,"" she said.

Dr. Naidoo says research shows mental health can be improved by increasing the good bacteria in the gut and minimizing the bad bacteria. She said for better or worse, these tiny organisms play a major role in the way we think and feel.

""The way that we eat is not just about our weight or our waistline,"" said Dr. Naidoo, ""it's also about our mental well-being.""

Dr. Naidoo points out that a gut-healthy diet is high in fruits and vegetables, whole grains, and healthy fats and contains very few processed foods and sugar.

Dr. Naidoo says a healthy diet is not usually meant to replace prescription medication for people suffering from mental health disorders but can often offer additional benefits beyond drugs.

""I would never suggest eliminating or removing one form of treatment, because as a psychiatrist I've seen those can be very valuable, in fact, life-saving to some individuals,"" she said. ""So this is really meant to be an additional tool in your toolkit.""

However, she said many patients who were struggling with mental health issues like depression and anxiety but not taking medication saw their conditions improve just with diet alone.

""I see it all the time. I will get calls and emails coming back at me saying, 'I'm feeling calmer, I'm sleeping better,'"" she said. ""People notice the difference.""

Tailor-Made Diets

Dr. Naidoo said while a generally healthy diet can help people with just about every type of mental health problem, there are specific recommendations for certain diagnoses.

For example, Dr. Naidoo said people with ADD, ADHD, or people who experience difficulty focusing should eat a healthy breakfast every day. She said while intermittent fasting can be helpful for some, people with difficulty focusing should avoid fasting in the morning and instead consume a meal rich in polyphenols, such as those found in green tea, coffee, berries, cherries, kale, and chia seeds.

She said people with OCD or anxiety issues should consider avoiding too many glutamates, which are often found in seemingly healthy foods like tomato sauce, fish sauce, and miso. Glutamates are amino acids that act as neurotransmitters that are deeply intertwined with OCD symptoms.

Baked Salmon with Walnut Kale Pesto

Servings: 1 (8 servings of pesto)

Prep Time: 5 minutes

Cooking Time: 15 minutes

For the fish:

1 (4-6 ounce) salmon fillet, boneless and skinless

","Doctors say while these dishes stimulate the pleasure center in our brains giving us instant satisfaction, in the long run, they can actually harm our mental health.
""Brain and mental health, just like spiritual health, is a daily practice,"" he said.
Dr. Naidoo says research shows mental health can be improved by increasing the good bacteria in the gut and minimizing the bad bacteria.
She said people with OCD or anxiety issues should consider avoiding too many glutamates, which are often found in seemingly healthy foods like tomato sauce, fish sauce, and miso.

President Biden's tired and confused appearance at the presidential debate has some in the media and the party calling for him to get out of the race.

Both the New York Times and Atlanta Journal-Constitution have called for him to step aside, as have some major party donors.

Democrats are now worried Biden could cost them the Senate and keep them from flipping the House.

Maryland Democrat Congressman Jamie Raskin said there are different opinions about the path forward.

""There are very honest and serious and rigorous conversations happening at every level of our party because it is a political party and we have differences in point of view,"" Raskin said.

Politico reports members of Biden's family are urging him to stay in the race and privately calling for his top advisors to be fired for the president's poor performance, saying he was not properly prepared.

Delaware Democrat Sen. Chris Coons, a Biden ally, brushed off the president's performance, saying Biden still has the support of many in the Democratic Party.

""He had a scratchy, rough voice, and he answered in ways that were not forceful, but side by side, Donald Trump had a horrifying debate performance. Yes, he spoke plainly, but what he said was lie after lie after lie,"" Coons said.

Former House Speaker Nancy Pelosi told CNN Democrats will still retake the House with Biden on the ticket. ""Let us not make a judgment about a presidency on one debate. I don't think it's a problem. It's a bad night,"" Pelosi said.

But a new CBS/YouGov poll shows 72% of voters believe Biden does not have the mental and cognitive health to serve as president.

Even the former White House photographer weighed in, posting on Instagram ""It's time for Joe to go"" and telling Axios, ""The debate was not the first bad day, and it's not gonna be the last.""

Democratic strategists admit there is no way to change the party's nominee unless Biden himself steps aside.

The Biden campaign says that would lead to chaos.

Trump supporters offered their opinions to CBN News at a rally in Virginia on Friday.

Lauren Euhus said, ""I think at this point it's kind of a lost cause.""

Rie Sadler said, ""I think we started to see really how badly Joe's in decline and it's just sad.""

Today, the Trump campaign is expecting a Supreme Court ruling on his claim to presidential immunity, which could shield him from criminal prosecution.","Democrats Divided After Biden Debate FlopPresident Biden's tired and confused appearance at the presidential debate has some in the media and the party calling for him to get out of the race.

JERUSALEM, Israel – After President Joe Biden's shocking debate performance Thursday, Israelis are alarmed, as are many other allies. They worry evil actors on the world stage might take advantage of the world's greatest superpower being led by a frail, weak, commander-in-chief.

If America's Leader is Frail & Weak, Will Israel's Enemies Choose Now to Strike Harder?

As columnist Amnon Lord put it in Israel Hayom, “In a world rife with aggressive forces, the unflattering image of an American president – the leader of the free world – appearing weak and incoherent encourages them to exploit opportunities.”

Israeli columnist Nadav Eyal added in Yediot Ahronot, ""Weakness is not a trait that an American president can convey, by any means.""

Sen. John Barrasso (R-WY) expressed similar worries on Fox News this weekend, saying, ""It's what foreign leaders – our enemies – saw in that debate, in China, Russia, Iran, North Korea. Right now are they thinking, 'This is our moment of opportunity?'""

Biden Administration Accused of Still Withholding 7 Weapons Systems from Israel

Israeli Defense Minister Yoav Gallant told Israel Defense Forces in northern Israel this weekend it's their military might that may intimidate Hezbollah enough that it will halt its daily attacks in the region and negotiate a peace deal.

Gallant declared the nation is readying either for war or for peace, noting Israel is ""preparing the military force, defense, attack, and this can happen quickly. On the other hand, the political alternative is being prepared. It is always preferable. We are not looking for war, but we are ready for it.""

He added, ""The thing that gives us the flexibility to be able to discuss political solutions is that we have military solutions.""

But as Israel may soon face war with Hezbollah and its more than 150,000 missiles, one highly-placed U.S. lawmaker says the Biden administration is still withholding seven weapons systems from the Jewish Nation.

On Fox News Sunday, Rep. Michael McCaul (R-TX), who chairs the powerful House Foreign Affairs Committee revealed, “This is what is most disturbing to me, is that we’re withholding weapon systems that I have signed off on and Congress has appropriated with the intent of sending those weapons to Israel.”

'Hamas Is the Only Obstacle'

Noa Argamani, one of those four Israeli hostages rescued in Gaza recently, is speaking out. She's reminding the nation that so many hostages remain in captivity.

In a video, she implored, ""We can't forget about the hostages who are still in Hamas captivity, and we must do everything possible to bring them back home.""

Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu is pointing out that no hostage deal can currently be worked out because Hamas refuses to deal.

As he put it, “And today everyone knows a simple truth: Hamas is the only obstacle to the release of our hostages.""

Hamas claims the problem is that Israel won't agree to end the war and remove all its troops from Gaza. ""Without this being achieved, all that is presented is just a waste of time,"" said senior Hamas official Osama Hamdan.

Netanyahu, though, contends that there is no way to end the war until Hamas is completely defeated by Israeli forces.

""Every day they (the IDF) eliminate dozens of terrorists,"" Netanyahu stated. ""It is a difficult struggle that is waged above ground, sometimes in face-to-face battles, and it is also waged underground.""

“Anthem of Grace” kicked off with a massive global broadcast on Good Friday, hitting tens of millions of people with the Gospel. Translated into 60 languages, millions more are still consuming the content in nations across the world months after the event was first aired.

“It’s been amazing to see what God is doing,” Hall, founder of the Pulse Movement, told CBN News. “And I think we all know this, but … there’s a revival spreading. There’s joy, there’s hope.”

The evangelist said the Anthem of Grace campaign centers, in part, on “Amazing Grace,” the “most sung and most translated hymn ever.” Beyond that, he said the campaign seeks to focus on the power of the Gospel to change hearts and minds.

“[It also focuses on the] story of every believer whose life has been changed by this and trying to tell the story of God’s grace in our lives, and welcoming people into that anthem of grace,” Hall said.

The faith leader said the mission of highlighting the change God has made in people’s lives and helping others discover the same transformation in their own journeys is the pinnacle of the campaign.

“It’s just incredible to see the hunger, and we’re really just trying to see a global movement of just pointing back to the grace of God,” Hall said. “And, hopefully, equipping as many believers as possible to share that story of how God’s changed them.”

Hall said he is humbled to see how God has used his ministry to reach so many hearts.

Listen to the latest episode of “Quick Start”

“This is amazing. … I’ve got three kids, I’m in a ministry now 20 plus years,” he said. “And I’m just incredibly humbled and incredibly thankful to still be following Jesus. I’m thankful to be more in love with Jesus than I’ve ever been.”

At the end of the year, Hall said he hopes “Anthem of Grace” helps light a fire in the hearts of people who have not yet encountered the Lord.

“In my heart and talking to so many believers … I just believe Jesus is coming soon … I just go to, you know, ‘How do we see as many people as possible hear the Gospel and know the Gospel?'”

Hall continued, “Because we know that … the Word promises things, right? The Word’s going to go to the ends of the Earth and then Christ is going to return.”

The preacher offered a reminder of what the Bible says about the end of days, noting how Jesus proclaims there will be “wars, and rumors and wars” and other happenings. Every generation since Christ has awaited His return, but Hall said world conditions right now make it feel more impending.

“It does seem like there’s a quickening around the world,” he said. “And I think what we’re seeing is that the dark is getting darker and the evil is getting greater. And, with that, the light is seeing brighter.”

Hall wants every person who claims to know Jesus to “testify to the goodness of God” — something he believes would immediately transform global circumstances.

“It would change the world overnight … just the testimony of the saints,” Hall said. “Even in Revelation, it says, ‘We’re going to overcome by the blood of the lamb and the word of their testimony.'”

Thus, he hopes people’s testimonies make a massive difference by proving the Gospel’s power and sway to a watching world.","Evangelist Nick Hall is in the midst of yet another monumental, year-long evangelism campaign — and he believes hearts and souls are being transformed.

Hengaw, an organization reporting on human rights violations against Kurds in Iran, stated there has been no reason given for the charges against the five Christians.

Listen to the latest episode of “Quick Start”

Hamid Afzali was sentenced to 10 years behind bars, followed by Nasrollah Mousavi, Bijan Gholizadeh, and Iman Salehi, each of whom were sentenced to five years, and Zohrab Shahbazi, who received a nine-month jail sentence, The Jerusalem Post reported.

In a statement to CBN News, Todd Nettleton, vice president of message for the Voice of the Martyrs, said, “The growth of the church in Iran is wonderful news for Christians around the world, and a great reminder of God’s ability to grow His church in spite of anything that any government might do to stop it.”

“But the high price our Iranian brothers and sisters are paying to follow Christ is a different kind of reminder: to pray often for them as they willingly suffer for the name of Christ,” he added.

The report from Hengaw noted that, while Christians are “acknowledged as a religious minority in Iran, authorities impose severe penalties, especially on those who convert from Islam to Christianity.”

Iran’s decision to imprison the five Christian converts violates article 18 of the United Nations’ International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, which states, “Everyone shall have the right to freedom of thought, conscience and religion. This right shall include freedom to have or to adopt a religion or belief of his choice, and freedom, either individually or in community with others and in public or private, to manifest his religion or belief in worship, observance, practice, and teaching.”

In addition to these five Christian arrests, Hengaw noted that another recent Christian convert in Iran, Yasin Mousavi, has been sentenced to 15 years in prison for charges including “membership in groups or associations aimed at disrupting security” and “propaganda against the government through promoting Christianity.”

OpenDoors.org, which tracks Christian persecution around the globe, has placed Iran at No. 9 on its World Watch List and rates the persecution Christians face in the Muslim-ruled country as “extreme.”

“For Christians who convert from Islam, not even the veneer of tolerance is present. Conversion from Islam to Christianity is illegal in Iran, and anyone caught as a convert can be arrested and imprisoned,” the organization explained in part. “The government views conversion as an attempt by the West to undermine Islam and the Islamic government of Iran. This means that anyone who is discovered to be a member of a house church can be charged with a crime against national security, which can lead to long prison sentences.”

Please be in prayer for our brothers and sisters in Christ facing persecution in Iran.","Five converts to Christianity have been sentenced by the Iranian judiciary to a collective of more than 25 years in prison, according to a report from Iran International.

Now, it's on a mission to build 40 more megachurches in the next 10 years.

Most roads in Hyderabad on Sundays lead to Calvary Temple. Shortly after 4 a.m., side streets around the church here are already jammed.

As church volunteers coordinate traffic, shuttle buses, auto rickshaws, and motorcycles ferry thousands of people, all trying to get here two hours ahead of Calvary's first of five services that begin at 6 a.m.

By sunrise, the faithful have taken their seats.

The main sanctuary holds 18,000 people supported by adjacent Bethlehem Hall with 15,000 and a third structure accommodating more than 3,000 more.

Hundreds more watch on television screens scattered around the sprawling Calvary campus.

Pastor Satish Kumar preaches all five services with the last one ending at 8 p.m.

""I've been given the grace to pastor this church which is beyond my dream and imagination,"" Pastor Kumar told CBN News.

Calvary Temple started in 2005 with about two dozen people. Today, it boasts more than 300,000 members making it one of the largest churches in the world.

They have 11 satellite churches with plans for more nationwide expansion.

""God put a burden in my heart to establish 40 mega churches just like what you see here during the next 10 years,"" said Kumar.

Pastor Kumar says the church adds some 3,000 new believers each month in a sign that the Lord is moving mightily across the country.

""God's hand is upon India, it's a time for India to reach the lost, not only within the country but across the globe,"" Kumar said.

In addition, the church produces over 650 TV programs each month in 17 of the country's major languages for broadcast on national television.

""It's not only within the nation, but also in Bangladesh, Nepal, Sri Lanka, Afghanistan, Pakistan and Gulf countries,"" said Kumar.

Millions more follow on social media. The reason for the church's success?

""Preaching the pure Word of God is what attracts people, and practicing the Word of God is what keeps people within the church,"" said Kumar.

That practical demonstration is on full display here each Sunday.

Narayana Podhili works as a civil engineer during the week. On Sunday, he leads an army of 150 church volunteers who spend hours chopping, slicing, peeling, and stirring – all to prepare free breakfast, lunch, and dinner meals for 50,000 people.

""We are committed to come here every Sunday at 3:30 a.m., 4 a.m., and we keep working till evening,"" Podhili told CBN News as he marshaled his forces.

Nagavalli Mendem has served in the Calvary kitchen for seven years after making a promise to God that if He healed her cancerous tumor, she would serve the church in this capacity.

""Because I made that promise, God healed me completely without surgery,"" Mendem said. ""God cleared the tumor in my chest and healed me. As a thanksgiving to Him, I serve here at the Lord's house.""

She and volunteers feed more than 200,000 people each month.

""In India, we say, 'service to mankind is service to God' so that is what we try to practice,"" Kumar said. ""We try to show God's love in action in every possible way that we find.""

Calvary also has an on-campus hospital where members get free medical treatment on Sundays and medicines at reduced cost.

""The majority of the people who come here are poor and cannot afford treatment,"" said Dr. Vinod Kumar of Calvary Hospital.

Members also have access to church facilities to hold marriages. And when a church member passes away, Calvary handles all funeral, burial, and meal arrangements – again, all for free.

In 2007, Calvary Temple created an access card system, the first of its kind, to follow up with members and their families.

""I have thousands of people. How do I know who hasn't shown up on a Sunday? As I was praying God put access card into my mind,"" Kumar said.

Each member must swipe their card when attending any one of the five Sunday services.

""Without fail, if we don't show up to church, we get a call,"" said Chandraiah, a Calvary Temple member. ""They'll ask me why I didn't come to church and after they find out they will pray for me. I'm happy when I receive that call. Not only that, but the fact also that they care for us is special, and because of that we will surely come to the next service.""

Pastor Kumar says prayer has always been an integral part of their success. The church has held 40 days of prayer and fasting regularly since 2005 drawing tens of thousands of young participants to stadiums around the country.

""During this 40 days of fasting and prayer, I teach from Genesis to Revelation,"" Kumar told CBN News. ""Every book I try to explain. Hundreds of thousands of young kids end up reading the whole Bible.""

Each month, the church, along with its satellite campuses, holds a ""Night with God"" as members pray for revival.

""About 25,000 to 30,000 people join. That has been the biggest, largest all-night prayer services in our nation,"" Kumar said.

In recent years, however, India has witnessed an unprecedented uptick in violence against Christians.

""The more the persecution, the more the church grows and that's what's happening in India,"" Kumar said.

Most attacks are carried out by Hindu extremist groups who accuse Christians of forcibly converting people to Christianity.

Pastor Kumar, a Hindu convert to Christianity himself, says resistance produces power.

""No persecution has ever succeeded in stopping the preaching of the Word of God, it always promoted the Word of God and spread the Word of God across the countries,"" said Kumar. ""It's my passion, my burden that before I die, I want to see every Indian will hear the gospel and know the Savior.""

Oklahoma's top education official ordered public schools to incorporate the Bible into lessons for grades five through 12 this week.

State school superintendent Ryan Walters says his mandate is compulsory and “immediate and strict compliance is expected.”

He points out that since the Bible's influence on America and Western civilization has been foundational, students need to be educated about its role in U.S. and world history.

""The Bible is an indispensable historical and cultural touchstone,"" Walters said. ""Without basic knowledge of it, Oklahoma students are unable to properly contextualize the foundation of our nation which is why Oklahoma educational standards provide for its instruction.""

Walters has previously noted that America is in a culture war and he doesn't want “woke ideology” spread by the state's public schools.

Left-wing groups have predictably threatened legal action calling the state school superintendent's move a violation of the U.S. Constitution. “Public schools are not Sunday schools,” said Rachel Laser, president and CEO of Americans United for Separation of Church and State.

Oklahoma law explicitly allows Bibles in the classroom and lets teachers use them in instruction.

But earlier this week the Oklahoma Supreme Court blocked the state's attempt to launch the first publicly funded religious charter school in the U.S.

He went on to condemn the modern political left as “aggressively anti-common sense” during an interview with English journalist Tina Brown at the Aspen Ideas Festival in Colorado.

“Part of it the left has to own,” he told Brown. “They are aggressively anti-common sense. The Democrats keep running on this one idea, saying to the American people, ‘You can’t possibly think you can do worse than Donald Trump.’ And they keep saying, ‘Yes, we can. Yes, we can.'”

Maher went on to explain he has Democratic friends who have leftist children, many of whom, the comedian suggested, accuse their parents of “old thinking” and not understanding their progressive points of view.

“Tear down statues of Lincoln? Maybe give communism another shot? Get rid of the border patrol? Get rid of capitalism? White supremacy has never been worse? Gender is always just a social construct? It’s OK to have penises in the women’s swimming pool, in women’s prisons?” he said, listing a handful of the views held by leftists. “No, it’s not that I’m old; it’s that your ideas are stupid.”

Listen to the latest episode of “Quick Start”:

Maher explained to Brown that, if Democrats insist on embracing far-leftist ideals and refuse to collaborate in any way with Republicans who oppose Trump, they are only aiding the GOP in defeating incumbent President Joe Biden.

“That’s as good as it gets,” he said. “If you can’t talk to those people, you’re just abandoning the country to half the people who are even worse, who are going to vote for Trump this next time — and they are — and he very likely will win, and then what are we going to do?”

“I think we should keep the dialogue open,” the HBO’s “Real Time” host added.

Maher recently appeared on the ABC talk show “The View,” where he condemned those on the left who have chosen to vehemently oppose Israel and protest in support of Hamas.

“If I had any doubt that I was right about the change that’s happened in the left, watching people protest for a terrorist organization like Hamas — that straightened me out pretty quick,” he said, later adding, “It’s astounding to me that they can’t tell the good guys from the bad guys, just morally. If you’re for Hamas, just live in Gaza for a day … [even] before the war.”

Ultimately, he said the best way to stop Israel from retaliating is to “stop attacking Israel.”

In what's widely known as the Chevron case, the court took a step to curb the ability of the ballooning federal bureaucracy to bypass Congress with backdoor regulations.

In the other case, the high court issued a ruling about obstruction that could have a big impact on the future of President Trump and Capitol riot defendants.

The Chevron Case & the 'Deep State'



In a far-reaching decision, the Supreme Court upended the 40-year-old Chevron precedent that made it easier for federal government agencies to create their own rules on issues like the environment, public health, and business regulations.

The original Chevron decision allowed federal agencies to unilaterally fill in the details whenever government officials claimed the laws passed by Congress were too ambiguous.

Critics have argued for decades that only Congress has been given the power to legislate, so allowing bureaucrats broad power to invent thousands of regulations violates the U.S. Constitution. It's one of the reasons those critics have referred to the massive size of the federal government as the ""nanny state"" or even the ""deep state"" because unelected bureaucrats often seized that opportunity to operate autonomously from the legislative or judicial branches.

THE CHEVRON CASE David v Goliath: Small Businesses Fight Federal Bureaucracy at US Supreme Court

BREAKING: In a major blow to the unelected administrative state, the Supreme Court has overruled the Chevron doctrine, which required courts to defer to the legal interpretations of unelected bureaucrats.



“Chevron is overruled.” pic.twitter.com/tqC5EYaUBl — Sean Davis (@seanmdav) June 28, 2024

Chief Justice John Roberts wrote the court's opinion stating, ""Perhaps most fundamentally, Chevron's presumption is misguided because agencies have no special competence in resolving statutory ambiguities. Courts do.""

Tyler O'Neil, managing editor of the Daily Signal, wrote on X, ""This is a huge step forward for holding the administrative state—and the deep state—accountable.""

The Capitol Riot and Obstruction

In the other major case, the Supreme Court made it harder to charge Capitol riot defendants with obstruction, a charge that also has been brought against former President Donald Trump.

In a 6-3 ruling, the court ruled that charging someone with obstructing an official proceeding must include proof that defendants tried to tamper with or destroy documents. Only some of the people who breached the Capitol on Jan. 6, 2021, fall into that category, so many of those cases are expected to be affected by reduced sentencing.

Liberty Counsel Founder and Chairman Mat Staver said, ""This new narrow interpretation will make it difficult for these indictments to stand.""

Chief Justice John Roberts wrote Friday's decision, joined by Justices Samuel Alito, Neil Gorsuch, Brett Kavanaugh, and Clarence Thomas, and by Biden nominee Justice Ketanji Brown Jackson.

It's unclear how the court's decision might affect the obstruction case by Special Counsel Jack Smith against Trump in Washington. But the high court is expected to release a separate decision Monday regarding presidential immunity, and that ruling will directly impact Smith's case.

But the amount of firepower being assembled on Israel's northern border suggests that war could start any day now.

By the tens of thousands, Israeli troops continue gathering and preparing on that border with Lebanon. Their purpose is to stop Hezbollah terrorists who've been attacking northern Israel from Lebanon almost daily for months.

That's forced some 80,000 Israelis to flee their homes and empty out whole communities near the border. As Kiryat Shmona resident Yarden Haziza puts it, ""Living right now in Kiryat Shmona is very sad. The city is empty most of the time.""

Hezbollah hit the north with some 40 rockets on just Thursday alone. The terrorists say it was to avenge a number of recent Israeli air strikes on Hezbollah infrastructure and personnel.

'On the March to Conquer the Middle East'

As the war against Hamas grinds on in Gaza and tensions mount in the north, Israel's prime minister keeps trying to get the world to focus on the threat from Iran, the massive power behind both Hezbollah and Hamas. Benjamin Netanyahu insists Iran's jihadists have an evil goal.

He's warning Iran and its proxies are, as he put it, ""On the march to conquer the Middle East.""

Visiting the north this week, Israel's president complained the international community is doing little to stave off war. So Isaac Herzog said it shouldn't be surprised if, as he said, ""The situation spirals out of control.""

Exuberant Defiance of Terrorism

Even as Israel braces for what could be another massive and painful war, the Tribe of Nova came together in Tel Aviv Thursday in exuberant defiance of terrorism. They held their first mass concert since Hamas attacked their festival near Gaza on October 7th.

Nimrod Arnin's sister was among the more than 360 festival-goers killed there.

He told the concert crowd, “On that Saturday at the beginning of October, our light was put to the test - a test which in our worst nightmares we didn’t imagine we would have to pass. The ultimate darkness challenged the big light of the Tribe of Nova.""

The Thursday concert featured dozens of dancers on stage re-enacting the horror of that morning. And the crowd of tens of thousands all stood quiet in a long moment of silence commemorating all who were lost.

'We Will Dance Again!'

But the main message of the day wasn't at all somber. It was that Israelis will not let the terrorists steal away their lust for life, or their joy, or their dance.

As concert attendee Maxim Mileyev put it, ""Nothing can stop us from living our lives here in Israel. And nothing can stop us from keeping on dancing and living.”

Nimrod Arnin summed up what so many in the Tribe of Nova have come to know. He told the concert crowd, ""In a moment of enlightenment we realized what is going to be the essence of our life from now and on. We will dance again!""

The crowd cheered him...and danced for hours. They wanted to show that while Hamas worships death, Israelis embrace life...and life to the fullest.

The UK general election is days away and, as the nation prepares to vote, pollsters are predicting a landslide victory for the Labour party. Prime Minister Rishi Sunak, whose campaign has been plagued by mishaps, has urged voters to support the Conservatives to avoid a sweeping Labour majority, while Reform UK, Green and Liberal Democrat leaders are seeking to win over voters disillusioned with the two main parties.

Here is a guide to the people and pledges that will shape the vote on Thursday.

Labour party

Since becoming Labour leader in 2020, Sir Keir Starmer has worked to convince business leaders and voters that his party can be trusted with the nation’s purse strings. It has pledged to boost economic growth and ruled out increasing the rate of several taxes, but a lack of concrete revenue-raising proposals has led to accusations that the Labour manifesto is based on “vibes”.

Starmer has stated that wealth creation is Labour’s “number one priority”. However, fiscal experts have warned that any party that wins the election will need to raise taxes or cut spending significantly as the UK grapples with poor public finances.

Overview IN NUMBERS 206 Seats in parliament before dissolution 326 Total seats needed to form a majority What’s at stake: If Labour wins the July 4 general election, as polls predict, the challenge for the party will be to deliver on its promises of economic stability and improved public services.

Labour’s key policies

Conservatives

The Conservatives’ 14 years in power have been marked by turmoil and a series of stark contrasts. Rising employment levels and the pensions “triple lock” sit alongside a decline in real wages, a deterioration of public services, and the costs and complications of Brexit. Since the 2016 referendum, the party has struggled to contain infighting, having produced five prime ministers in nine years. Prime Minister Rishi Sunak’s promise to cut inflation has been kept, but pledges to reduce NHS waiting lists and “stop the boats” that bring in migrants have failed.

Overview IN NUMBERS 345 Seats in parliament before dissolution 65 MPs not standing for re-election What’s at stake: The Conservatives’ biggest challenge this election is regaining the trust of ordinary voters to avoid an electoral wipeout. Several Tory “safe seats” are predicted to turn red or yellow as the nation grapples with a cost of living crisis, the longest NHS waiting list in memory and an economy described as the “sick man of Europe”.

Key policies

Liberal Democrats

Traditionally the UK’s third major party, the Liberal Democrats have not been in power for more than a century, except as a coalition partner with the Tories from 2010 to 2015. Leader Sir Ed Davey’s manifesto pledge to secure a favourable trade deal with the EU has set the party apart in a political landscape largely devoid of any debate on Brexit. Earlier this year, Davey told the FT that the party expected to win votes from “Theresa May Conservative[s]” in Tory strongholds.

Overview IN NUMBERS 15 Seats in parliament before dissolution What’s at stake: Ahead of the election, the Lib Dems “have a simple task — tell voters that they exist, persuade those voters that the Lib Dems should win, that the Conservatives can be beaten, and equally importantly that Labour cannot beat them”.

Reform UK

Founded by Nigel Farage as the Brexit party, the since-rebranded Reform UK aims to tap into discontent with the major parties over issues including immigration. The party chose not to stand against the Conservatives in 2019, but is now fielding candidates in almost every seat. Described by its leadership as an “entrepreneurial political start-up”, Reform has been a growing force in the election, overtaking the Tories in some polls.

Though not expected to win many constituencies, Reform is likely to take support from the Tories that may cost the incumbent party a significant number of seats.

Overview IN NUMBERS 1 Seat in parliament before dissolution What’s at stake: A strong Reform turnout is likely to be detrimental to Conservative hopes, but the party's future beyond being a rightwing protest vote remains unclear.

SNP

The current largest party in Scotland, the Scottish National party dominates areas that were traditionally held by Labour. However, the party has struggled to raise campaign funds following a police investigation into alleged embezzlement of SNP coffers and the forced resignation of two leaders in as many years.

Overview IN NUMBERS 43 Seats in parliament before dissolution What’s at stake: The SNP faces the challenge of repelling Labour in its traditional heartlands. The party is forecast to win 21 seats in Scotland, down from 48 in 2019. Independence, rejected by the Scottish people in a 2014 referendum, remains a long-term goal.

Green party

The Green party has moved beyond its traditional environmental focus to position itself as the pre-eminent leftwing Labour alternative, in the hopes of stealing voters disillusioned by Starmer’s policies on Gaza, taxation and public investment.

Overview IN NUMBERS 1 Seat in parliament before dissolution What’s at stake: The Green party’s primary goal in the July 4 election is to increase its representation in parliament and influence policy on environmental issues as public concern over climate change grows.

Plaid Cymru

Plaid Cymru’s campaign has focused on advocating for the interests of Wales in Westminster. The party has emphasised the need for greater investment in the Welsh economy and healthcare system and has pledged £4bn in funds from HS2 to improve public transport in the country.","Print this pageThe UK general election is days away and, as the nation prepares to vote, pollsters are predicting a landslide victory for the Labour party.

Fortune,https://fortune.com/2024/07/02/tom-brady-patriots-ed-bastian-delta-success/,2024-07-02,19:25:26 UTC,Tom Brady ascribes his success to demanding to be treated like it’s his ‘first day on the job’,"Say what you will about Tom Brady, but there’s no undercutting his singularity—or the endless fascination with how he “gets it done”.

During his momentous football career, the longtime New England Patriots quarterback won seven Super Bowl rings—the most of any player, ever—and garnered a reputation for being fastidious and disciplined. (TB12, anyone?)

In his second act, Brady has pivoted toward everything from NFTs to FTX to sports commentating to, most recently, partnering with Delta Air Lines as an advisor. He appeared opposite CEO Ed Bastian on Delta’s Gaining Altitude podcast this week to extol his virtues and values and reflect on what’s put him ahead of the pack.

“One of the key fundamentals to my personal success—and our team’s success, over a long period of time—is that nobody was afraid of constructive criticism,” Brady, 49, told Bastian. Criticism “really means you cared about the other person. I always felt like the people that I cared about the most, I was going to have those tough conversations about what I thought they needed to do to improve.”

Whether that meant Brady noticed shoddy preparation for a game, or hot-and-cold emotional approaches, he said he almost thought it would be a disservice not to call his teammates out. And the team superstar wasn’t immune. “I wanted everyone to have that with me too; I had to be open to their constructive criticism. I got that from the owner, from the head coach, and from my position coach; I never wanted to feel like they couldn’t coach me.”

Indeed, it was critical for both Brady’s bosses and peers to “feel like they were in a position of authority” to tell him he needed to up his game. Granted, he may not have needed much coaching, particularly in his highest-performing, record-breaking years.

“The easy thing for me was to be like, Don’t you understand? I’m Tom Brady. I won this before. I’ve been MVP,” he remarked. “But that’d be the worst thing to do.” Fearing an echo chamber, where all that his peers and coaches did was indulge him, Brady told Bastian he made a point to ensure everyone in his midst knew he was open to criticism.

“I’m always one of the teammates. I needed to relate to all the guys,” Brady said. “Maybe I did develop a higher standard of performance over a period of time, but I was lucky, because I had a lot of experience.”

That divide led Brady to his main ethos, to which he credited his ongoing success: Never getting jaded. “Some of these guys were brand new, but I wanted them to treat me like it was my first day on the job, too,” he said.

Part and parcel of a first-day-on-the-job mentality is maintaining balance, he added. “”It’s always about regulating the inputs and outputs; when I really need to put out a lot of energy and emotion, I had to make sure I had it left in the tank,” he said. “I really had to make sure I was conscious about what I was doing the day before the game and what I was doing after the game.”

As the undisputed star, Brady said his teams—and fans—needed him consistently at 100% in focus, determination, concentration and energy. That calls for the right food, the right hydration, the right bodywork, and critically, “the right people around me.” Ideally, people who can call him out when he’s slacking.","Say what you will about Tom Brady, but there’s no undercutting his singularity—or the endless fascination with how he “gets it done”.

Fortune,https://fortune.com/2024/07/02/jerome-powell-inflation-interest-rates/,2024-07-02,19:24:33 UTC,Fed Chair Jerome Powell says inflation is on the downswing—but don’t expect rate cuts yet,"Inflation in the United States is slowing again after higher readings earlier this year, Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell said Tuesday, while adding that more such evidence would be needed before the Fed would cut interest rates.

After some persistently high inflation reports at the start of 2024, Powell said, the data for April and May “do suggest we are getting back on a disinflationary path.”

Speaking in a panel discussion at the European Central Bank’s monetary policy conference in Sintra, Portugal, Powell said Fed officials still want to see annual price growth slow further toward their 2% target before they would feel confident of having fully defeated high inflation.

“We just want to understand that the levels that we’re seeing are a true reading of underlying inflation,” he added.

Powell also acknowledged that the Fed is treading a fine line as it weighs when to cut its benchmark interest rate, which it raised 11 times from March 2022 through July 2023 to its current level of 5.3%. The rate hikes were intended to curb the worst streak of inflation in four decades by slowing borrowing and spending by consumers and businesses. Inflation did tumble from its peak in 2022 yet still remains elevated.

If the Fed cuts rates too soon, Powell cautioned, inflation could re-accelerate, forcing the policymakers to reverse course and impose punishing rate hikes. But if the Fed waits too long to reduce borrowing costs, it risks weakening the economy so much as to potentially cause a recession.

“Getting the balance on monetary policy right during this critical period — that’s really what I think about in the wee hours,” Powell said in response to a question about his top worries.

On Friday, the government reported that consumer prices, according to the Fed’s preferred measure, were unchanged from April to May, the mildest such reading in more than four years. And compared with a year earlier, inflation dropped to just 2.6% in May, from 2.7% in April, the government said.

Excluding volatile food and energy costs, “core” prices also barely rose from April to May. On a year-over-year basis, core inflation fell to 2.6% from 2.8% in April. The latest inflation figures were a sharp improvement from early this year.

In his appearance Tuesday, Powell said the U.S. economy and job market remain fundamentally healthy, which means the Fed can take its time in deciding when rate cuts are appropriate. Most economists think the Fed’s first rate cut will occur in September, with potentially another cut to follow by year’s end.

The Fed chair also said the job market is “cooling off appropriately,” which likely means that it won’t heighten inflationary pressures through rapid wage gains.

“It doesn’t look like it’s heating up or presenting a big problem for inflation going forward,” Powell said of the job market. “It looks like it’s doing just what you would want it to do, which is to cool off over time.”

Powell declined to signal any time frame for a rate cut. Investors are betting that there is nearly a 70% chance for a reduction at the Fed’s meeting in September.

Fed officials have expressed a range of views on inflation and interest-rate policy since their last meeting a little over two weeks ago.

John Williams, president of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York and vice chair of the central bank’s rate-setting committee, said last week, “I am confident that we at the Fed are on a path to achieving our 2% inflation goal on a sustained basis.”

Mary Daly, president of the San Francisco Fed, cautioned last week, though, that it was “hard to know if we are truly on track to sustainable price stability.”

In his appearance Tuesday in Portugal, Powell spoke at a panel along with Christine Lagarde, president of the European Central Bank, and Roberto Campos Neto, the head of Brazil’s central bank.

The ECB has already made a quarter-point cut to its key rate this year, with inflation in the 20-nation eurozone having sunk from above 10% to just 2.5%.

In her remarks Tuesday, though, Lagarde reiterated that the ECB is not on any “predetermined path” and that its recent rate cut “would be followed by further review of data.”

Such comments have led many analysts to conclude that the ECB’s next rate cut won’t occur until September at the earliest.","If the Fed cuts rates too soon, Powell cautioned, inflation could re-accelerate, forcing the policymakers to reverse course and impose punishing rate hikes.

Fortune,https://fortune.com/2024/07/02/us-china-competition-benefiting-worldand-global-economy-supply-chains-politics-leadership/,2024-07-02,18:48:15 UTC,How U.S.-China competition is benefiting the world—and reshaping the global economy,"The strategic competition between the United States and China is a much broader story that is having an impact on all countries and cross-border business.

The new globalization story starts in China because of the country’s rapid economic rise and geopolitical tensions. For the most part, companies have an over-concentration of manufacturing and supply chains in China. But overconcentration is not limited to China.

As we outlined in May, we do not see deglobalization or decoupling in our research or engagement with Multinational Corporations (MNCs)—nor do we see a continuation of the status quo. The forces causing the decoupling discussion—such as geopolitical stresses, national security concerns, strategic competition considerations, data privacy, vague state secret laws, general distrust, and the demise of rule-enforcing international organizations—are real.

However, manufacturing is, for the most part, not returning to Western countries or tightly targeted emerging consumer countries, a basic claim of deglobalization theory. It is going elsewhere (to countries such as Vietnam and Mexico). Rather than decouple and disengage. MNCs are doing what they have excelled at for over a century: seeking ways to adapt and prosper. We call this transformation “reglobalization.”

Ideally, the end result will be a multipolar world with more countries participating in global business and prosperity.

We concluded that reglobalization will be eventually positive for the West and China, as well as for emerging workforces and consumers everywhere, particularly women.

The end of an era

The migration of supply chain capacity and control to third countries by Chinese, U.S., and European MNCs is an overlooked competitive dimension of the emerging order. Over the past 30 years, MNCs have sought to achieve cost benefits through the migration of manufacturing and related supply chains to lower-cost countries. Export data does little to reveal the commercial entities controlling and benefitting from the cross-border movement of goods and services, and these entities are, of course, the ones making the strategic choices.

To achieve maximum efficiencies of scale in the 1990s and early 2000s, MNCs tended to concentrate growth and sourcing efforts in a single facility or region. In many, if not most cases, this meant China. As reforms unfolded and China became increasingly hospitable to foreign investment, it checked all the boxes. This is not to say there were no hiccups. In 2003, the SARS threat triggered broad discussions of the risks of overconcentration, the importance of contingency planning, and the value of supply chain diversification. But like the SARS threat itself, the discussion was short-lived.

Over the past decade, and particularly since the start of the COVID-19 pandemic, the folly of prioritizing efficiency and ignoring resiliency has become apparent. The global landscape has been transformed by the addition of many complications, including geopolitics, shifts toward nativism in consumer sentiment and politics, climate change, demographic changes, and natural resource distribution.

In parallel with supply chain relocation, MNCs began to seek access to new consumer markets in emerging economies beyond China. Given China’s slowdown in consumption growth, the motivation to branch out for growth amplifies the motivation to branch out for additional supply hubs to build resiliency.

The current phase of reglobalization began with the natural migration of light manufacturing from China to lower-cost countries. China has methodically pressed to climb the value chain to avoid stalling its manufacturing and export success. Even though productivity gains were modest, through the systematic if often inefficient deployment of central resources, overcapacity, and a very rapid ramp-up of export value chains, China continues to be one of the lowest-cost places to manufacture in the world.

Demographic and other societal changes will shrink China’s labor force, and that will build pressure to continue upgrading its production activity and incentivizing its enterprises to internationalize. China’s economic system will likely sustain its exceptional export competitiveness in the areas that the state planners have identified.

While the diversification is being artificially accelerated by these factors, the fact is that more than 2 billion people are yet to be globalized as new and accessible consumers and laborers.

An operational transformation

Most MNCs readily acknowledge that their China experience has transformed their entire global activity. During their China decades, MNCs in industries such as IT, biotech, and semiconductors learned important lessons about speed-to-market, product localization, and profoundly different legal and regulatory approaches that will prove valuable as they now face market challenges that will demand improvements in their own operations.

Many MNCs began the relocation journey in response to the Trump-era tariff strategy, something not to be confused with a resiliency strategy that is now the focus. For MNCs, the initial relocation of manufacturing is costly and not without new risks, including some starting and backtracking. Many American CEOs describe having boards that are split between China hawks and doves—those who see an urgent need to reduce China exposure and those who do not. Initial cost increases of over 20% are frequently reported by companies, even before any new capital expenditure requirements, before falling back within five years to 1 to 3% higher when supply chain efficiency and labor productivity are restored. However, once relocated, multiple and flexible sourcing locations and fast information and response systems provide resiliency and optionality. And they potentially open new markets for growth, too.

Of course, in globalized business, moving your own manufacturing or assembly is not a decision to be taken in isolation. Behind any one company’s operation is an entire supply chain. For decades, China focused on building a comprehensive supply base for commoditized electronic components that remains unparalleled. Many components can be sourced in a destination country without too much difficulty, but there are specialized items that require knowledge, rare resources, and large capital investments (such as semiconductors) that will require continued dependence on Mainland suppliers.

The disruption created by reglobalization, which will be as painful as when globalization first took off for those who get caught up in its effects such as factory worker job losses, will also force MNCs to build resiliency by putting low-end production in countries that have, until now, been largely excluded from global trade. For example, Pakistan, Tanzania, Kenya, much of Central Europe, and the Middle East have significant, untapped potential as manufacturing hubs and future fast-growth consumer markets.

With the creation of manufacturing jobs—typically in light manufacturing such as apparel, running shoes, and other light as well as semi-automated manufacturing—we expect to see the widespread employment of women, who are predominant in these jobs. As MNCs with light manufacturing set up operations in other emerging economies, those populations will both become consumers with their new, stable income and will begin to invest in their families. When women get regular paychecks, we typically see significant societal changes over comparatively short periods of time. In turn, these also positively impact the next generation (through higher living standards and education). There are numerous pro-cyclical dynamics at play when emerging economies open up.

We are also on the cusp of additional changes that are only lightly understood with AI, Network Manufacturing, Manufacturing 2.0, and additive manufacturing, other technologies for real-time manufacturing and logistic control, to name a few, each having significant potential to change the pace and direction of globalization.

The reglobalized landscape

The de-concentration of manufacturing and associated supply chains is a key process in the reglobalizing world. Notwithstanding the interest in Brazil, India, Eastern Europe, and South East Asian countries, we do not expect any emerging market or supply hub to dominate the attention of investors to the degree China did. MNC executives show little interest in a new over-concentration scenario.

A visible trend in recent years for many MNCs has been restructuring equity and control of entities within their constellations of business activities for tax efficiency, sanction compliance, tariff management, and resiliency. National borders have presented little impediment to a steady stream of mergers and acquisitions, which, along with buoyant capital markets, has elevated several MNCs to asset values north of $1 trillion. That’s why de-concentration does not imply descaling or fragmentation. The reglobalized landscape will see an unprecedented scale of strategically aligned business activity. The landscape also features massive, complex, multinational organizations whose geographic origins and legal domiciles are increasingly blurred and whose economic dimensions exceed many nations in the world. The degree to which their commercial decisions align with and influence government policies will be a significant dynamic in reglobalization.

To make this possible, we expect to see corporate structures move from a hub-and-spoke model to a web model, shaped by demand for local knowledge, relationships, data privacy rules, local content and compliance demands, and the ever-shortening viable time to market. For blocs that align more closely (such as North America and the EU), alignment solutions will be found, whereas competing blocs (such as North America and China) will struggle to find a stable solution for the range of interactions that are either unavoidable or commercially compelling.

Potential high-growth emerging economies will have leverage in pursuing their national interests by maintaining an unaligned position with respect to the strategic competition between China and the U.S. The current oil market exemplifies this dynamic in the interplay between allowed and sanctioned trade.

This will result in clusters of expertise and supporting supply chain infrastructure appearing in multiple countries, with virtual teams supplanting physically co-located teams.

Clusters add robustness and redundancy—but they also make it harder to exclude rivals from the global system. It is unclear whether the existing international organizations that support rules-based behaviors and effective dispute resolution will recover their importance and effectiveness.

Some recognized ills of rapid globalization are reflected in a change of ethos, with ESG concerns increasingly enforced by local regulation in economies of all levels of development. Initiatives are building to rein in tax inequalities and systemic tax avoidance, as well as exploitative relationships between investors and investees.

Unrecognized ills are equally certain to emerge in the reglobalized landscape, including innovations in cybercrime and terrorism, biological and chemical health threats, disruptive military events, and political catastrophes in major economies. Once effective global regulatory and dispute resolution bodies have dramatically declined in relevance. Major economies with a stake in stability and level market playing fields will either need to resurrect them or replace them. Fintech and cryptocurrencies, offering many efficiencies for global financial operations, also enable a range of opportunities for regulation avoidance and tax evasion.

However, we are optimistic. As MNCs spread their factories, they will acquire increased resiliency—which, in the longer term, will help to regulate inflation even as disruptions become more frequent. Emerging markets will benefit, uplifting populations and empowering women. But it will take a different type of manager, a different kind of company, and different processes to achieve commercial success under this new world order.

Envisioning the landscape of a reglobalized world is just the starting point for successful decision-making. In our final article in the series, we will analyze approaches to adjust to reglobalization and look at the corporate responses we are observing in the market to these changes and opportunities.

Fortune,https://fortune.com/2024/07/02/alzheimers-disease-eli-lilly-diagnosis-treatment-health-medicine/,2024-07-02,18:12:21 UTC,Alzheimer’s made my mom unable to recognize her grandkids. Breakthroughs too late for her can change the disease’s trajectory—if diagnosis and treatment start early,"My mother, Margaret, was the heart of our family. When my twins were born prematurely, she moved in with us to help care for them. Her support allowed me to take on being new mom of two and a busy career during a challenging time. And her selflessness stayed with me as I helped care for her later in life when she needed it most.

Mom was healthy and active in her late fifties when she first began showing signs of cognitive impairment. Within a few years, Alzheimer’s disease stole her joy for cooking, love of music, and ability to recognize her grandchildren.

My father, sisters, and I shared caregiver duties, watching her with vigilance, and balancing a new dynamic in our family. I found myself sleeping on my mother’s bedroom floor to prevent her from wandering in the night. We were a private family and did not discuss my mom’s illness very much outside our immediate circle. When caring for her, our world became small, our routine focused on keeping her safe. My sisters and I wondered, Will we be next?

It would be different if my mom were diagnosed today. Nearly two decades later, we know so much more about this disease. Improvements in detection, diagnosis, and medicines are offering new hope for slowing its progression.

Studies have confirmed we have the greatest opportunity to impact this disease in its earliest stages, when some people may initially show only subtle changes in memory and thinking that differ from normal aging. People at this state, often with mild cognitive impairment, may encounter minor challenges in everyday living, and may be younger and appear healthier than society has traditionally portrayed.

Innovations in diagnostics are now able to identify underlying disease pathology—clumps of amyloid plaques in the brain. And emerging blood tests hold promise to speed and simplify diagnosis with remarkable accuracy. Just years ago, for patients like my mom, a confirmed diagnosis wasn’t even possible until after death.

Changing perceptions of Alzheimer’s disease

Moving forward, it will take all of us—people with Alzheimer’s disease, providers, and families—to change how we view this disease and how we treat it.

More people need to be aware about the importance of the early detection of symptoms, often in the primary care setting, and reducing the stigma surrounding the disease so that more people are diagnosed. Today it can take more than two years on average to diagnose Alzheimer’s after the first symptom is detected. We need health care providers to include cognitive assessments and advanced diagnostics routinely in their clinical practice when Alzheimer’s disease is suspected. And, we must advocate for access and reimbursement for diagnostic tests as well as treatments.

We need greater equity across disease states, races, genders, and generations. Promoting available and affordable options across geographic and socioeconomic boundaries and allowing care close to home should be a priority. As a new generation of caregivers begin to take responsibility for their mothers, fathers, and families, we should make sure these newly diagnosed individuals are helped as early in their disease as possible.

The progress we are now realizing will lead to more investment and research in Alzheimer’s disease that will unlock further understanding and open the door to address other neurodegenerative conditions. This moment will be a catalyst to drive progress toward understanding diseases such as ALS, Parkinson’s, and multiple sclerosis. This is all within our reach: What were breakthroughs in science and care in cancer and cardiovascular disease in previous decades are now routine in how we treat these patients today. The same can be true in neurodegenerative disease.

Looking back on my mom’s experience, I remain deeply grateful that she continued to recognize my dad, my sisters, and me through the end of her life. When I held her hand and looked into her eyes as she passed away, I found comfort in knowing that she did not see a stranger, but a loving daughter who had felt a lifetime of love and care.

Scientific breakthroughs came too late for my mom. but they are not too late for people diagnosed today. The story of Alzheimer’s is now being rewritten. We have the chance to truly change the trajectory of this disease for many people, and we need to act with urgency to help them and those that love them. I would have given so much to have more time with my mom, and I am so glad that many families now have that chance for more time.

Fortune,https://fortune.com/2024/07/02/mtb-banking-stocks-midcap-picks-morgan-stanley-outlook/,2024-07-02,17:50:02 UTC,M&T Bank stock outlook: Morgan Stanley names MTB it's top midcap bank pick,"Most of the largest banks in America took a hit last week when they performed worse than last year on the Federal Reserve’s stress test to see how they’d react to a financial crisis. One winner was Buffalo, New York-based M&T Bank (MTB), which wasn’t just the highest scoring regional bank to be tested but was today moved to the top position on Morgan Stanley’s midcap banks earnings preview.

With a market cap of $26 billion, M&T is currently trading at $150.08, an increase of 0.17% today, and 7.95% so far this year. In the report, Morgan Stanley equity analyst Manan Gosalia attributes the decision to move M&T to the bank’s top slot to a successful stress test, improving credit, and stable deposit costs supporting an increase in net interest margins.

“MTB trades in line with peers,” writes Gosalia. “But deserves to trade at a premium given better underwriting quality versus peers, tailwinds in a higher for longer rate environment, and higher excess capital.” Overall, the midcap banks Morgan Stanley covers—defined as banks between $2 billion and $10 billion—underperformed last quarter’s, down 6%. Midcap banks are still cheap though, according to the report, trading at a discount of 5x on their price/earning ratio relative to historical levels.

Every year the Federal Reserve tests globally important banks to see how they’d perform in a variety of crises. This year, the central bank tested 31 large banks, in large part to see if they had enough assets in reserve to absorbe $685 billion in losses, among other struggles. Citibank was the best performing bank, with an estimated 30 basis point reduction in its stress capital buffer, with M&T coming in a close second with a 10 basis points reduction, according to a Wells Fargo report last week.

Today, Morgan Stanley refined those estimates, predicting that M&T will have almost 300bps of excess capital as a result of the reduced capital requirements and is expected to grow by 25bps more each quarter. A conservative approach to defining risky assets has also led the bank to a higher quality portfolio, according to Gosalia, and the excess liquidity resulting from an expected increase in net asset margin is expected to be deployed into longer dated securities.

M&T Bank’s stock is among four midcap banks listed as overweight in the Morgan Stanley report, meaning the researchers expect it will perform better over the next year. Other banks are Huntington Bancshares Incorporated (HBAC), which M&T replaced for the top spot, East West Bancorp (EWBC), and Webster Financial Corporation (WBS).

M&T’s second quarter earnings call is scheduled for July 18.","One winner was Buffalo, New York-based M&T Bank (MTB), which wasn’t just the highest scoring regional bank to be tested but was today moved to the top position on Morgan Stanley’s midcap banks earnings preview.

Fortune,https://fortune.com/2024/07/02/jolts-job-openings-layoffs-may/,2024-07-02,17:27:43 UTC,More workers were laid off in May as job openings increased,"U.S. job openings rose slightly to 8.1 million in May despite the impact of higher interest rates intended to cool the labor market.

Vacancies rose from a revised 7.9 million in April, the first reading below 8 million since February 2021, the Labor Department reported Tuesday. April openings were marked down from an originally reported 8.1 million.

Layoffs rose to 1.65 million in May from 1.54 million in April. The number of Americans quitting their jobs — a sign of confidence in their prospects — was basically unchanged.

“The report was another sign that the labor market is holding firm … The expansion looks solid,’’ said Robert Frick, economist at the Navy Federal Credit Union.

The U.S. economy and job market have been remarkably resilient in the face of the Federal Reserve’s campaign to raise interest rates to rein in inflation. The Fed hiked its benchmark rate 11 times in 2022 and 2023, lifting it to a 23-year high.

Hiring losing steam

Defying expectations of a recession, the U.S. economy kept growing and employers kept hiring.

But lately there have been signs the economy is losing some steam. Job openings have come steadily down since peaking at 12.2 million in March 2022. The job market is still strong. There are 1.25 jobs for every unemployed American, but that’s down from a 2-to-1 ratio in January 2023.

Fed policymakers welcome lower job openings — a relatively painless way to cool a hot job market and reduce pressure on companies to raise wages, which can feed inflation.

From January through March this year, the economy grew at an annual pace of just 1.4%, slowest since spring 2022. Consumer spending, which accounts for around 70% of U.S. economic activity, e xpanded just 1.5% after advancing at a pace of more than 3% in each of the last two quarters of 2023.

The Labor Department is expected to report Friday that employers added 190,000 jobs last month, down from 272,000 in May, according to a survey of forecasters by the data firm FactSet. Unemployment is forecast to stay low at 4%.

High interest rates have helped bring inflation down closer to the Fed’s target of 2% a year from a four-decade high 9.1% in June 2022. Progress on containing price increases is expected to allow the central bank to start cutting rates. Wall Street investors are expecting the first rate cut at the Fed’s September meeting.

Speaking at a conference in Portugal Tuesday, Fed Chair Jerome Powell said that progress toward lower inflation appears to have resumed after stalling earlier this year. But he said the Fed needed to see more evidence before it cuts rates.","U.S. job openings rose slightly to 8.1 million in May despite the impact of higher interest rates intended to cool the labor market.

Fortune,https://fortune.com/2024/07/02/moderna-bird-flu-vaccine-funding-government/,2024-07-02,16:59:21 UTC,Moderna gets $176 million from U.S. to develop bird flu vaccine,"The U.S. government will pay the vaccine maker Moderna $176 million to develop a pandemic vaccine that could be used to treat bird flu in people as cases in dairy cows continue to mount across the country, federal officials announced Tuesday.

The funds are targeted for release through the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services and will pay for continued development of a vaccine that uses the same mRNA technology that allowed rapid development and rollout of vaccines to protect against COVID-19. The award was made through the Biomedical Advanced Research and Development Authority, or BARDA, a program that focuses on medical treatments for potential pandemics.

Moderna will launch trials to test the safety and effectiveness of a vaccine that could be used to scale up a response to a bird flu pandemic, if needed.

The H5N1 virus was detected earlier this year in dairy cows and has spread to more than 135 herds in 12 states and infected three people to date, all with mild cases. Federal health officials stress that the risk to the wider population remains low.","The U.S. government will pay the vaccine maker Moderna $176 million to develop a pandemic vaccine that could be used to treat bird flu in people as cases in dairy cows continue to mount across the country, federal officials announced Tuesday.

Fortune,https://fortune.com/2024/07/02/iowa-14-year-old-drivers/,2024-07-02,15:38:37 UTC,New law in Iowa allows 14-year-olds get a driver’s license,"The number of very (very) young drivers in the Hawkeye State could be about to surge.

New legislation has gone into effect in Iowa that allows students to get their driver’s license, letting them drive unaccompanied, at the age of 14-and-a-half.

There are, as you would imagine, some restrictions. The license, called the special minor’s restricted license, mandates that young drivers can use the permit to drive only to school and work, extracurricular activities, or to complete farm work to assist parents or employers. They’ll have to have completed a driver’s education course, and they’ll need to have held an instruction permit (known as a learner’s permit in some states) for six months with a clean driving record. (The state allows 14-year-olds to drive with adult supervision.)

Should holders of these new restricted licenses break any traffic laws while driving, they will face stricter traffic offenses than other drivers. They’re also not permitted to carry more than one minor passenger who is not a relative.

While Iowa’s new minimum for its restricted license is low, it’s not uniquely so. South Dakota also allows 14-and-a-half-year-olds to get a restricted minor’s permit, letting them drive largely wherever they’d like from 6:00 a.m. through 10:00 p.m.

Still, some drivers in the state were a little hesitant about the potential influx of brand-new drivers.

“It’s gonna be riskier for everybody, nighttime driving, sports in the morning,” Steve Vernon, owner of AAAA Driving School, told WQAD. “They’re inexperienced. I mean they’re gonna get their license, then two days later they’re gonna be driving.”","New legislation has gone into effect in Iowa that allows students to get their driver’s license, letting them drive unaccompanied, at the age of 14-and-a-half.

The City Corporation’s planning committee voted Tuesday to hold off on a decision on plans for One Undershaft, a 309.6-meter (1,015.7-foot) skyscraper to be built on a site currently occupied by the former headquarters of UK insurer Aviva Plc. Plans for a slightly smaller office tower were previously approved in 2019, but the latest design has been tweaked to “better respond to post-pandemic needs,” according to a briefing note prepared for City councilors.

Demand for the best new office space that offers plentiful amenities and the highest environmental certifications has remained robust even as shifting working patterns and stricter regulation have seen vacancy rates in older buildings rise. But rapid construction-cost inflation and uncertainty about the economic outlook as the free-money era came to an end prompted many developers to defer plans for new projects, setting up the prospect of a supply shortage for the best new space.

The plans, submitted by developer Stanhope Plc, drew a litany of objections from the building’s neighbors, including the owners of the so-called Cheesegrater tower and the developers behind another proposed tower on Leadhenhall Street. The chair of insurance market Lloyd’s of London, whose historically protected headquarters sits opposite the proposed site, wrote to City officials to complain the plan would rob the City of an important convening space.

One Undershaft, set to occupy a site on St. Helen’s Square between the Cheesegrater and the Gherkin, would be a similar height to the Shard, a mixed-use tower on London’s South Bank that includes offices, a hotel and apartments. The proposal for the new tower includes a publicly accessible viewing gallery and education space at levels 72 and 73, along with a garden on the 11th story that would be open to visitors and include stores and restaurants.

The project, should it eventually win approval, is expected to take six to seven years to complete, Stanhope representatives said at Tuesday’s meeting.

Nine councilors voted to defer a decision on the project, while six voted against the motion and two abstained.","The City of London Corporation deferred a vote on plans for a new 73-story office tower next to the Gherkin that’s set to become the tallest building in the historic financial district.

Perhaps you’d never cook another meal again or indulge in a monthly Thai massage and a Soho House membership to unwind from the stress that comes with being at your A game.

Here at The Good Life you don’t have to imagine what life at the top looks like anymore: Get real-life inspiration for how the most successful live life.

Today Fortune meets Wingstop’s U.K. chief, 34-year-old London-based Tom Grogan.

If you live in the U.S. (or on TikTok) you’ll have undoubtedly heard of the popular American fast-food franchise.

The company was founded in Texas in 1994 and by 2002 the brand claimed to have served two million wings.

2,000,000 The number of wings Wingstop has served in just eight years.

Now—thanks to a cold email to the company’s information inbox five years ago—Grogan (along with his three co-founders) has brought the chain to Britain and the brand’s various flavored chicken wings have translated well across the pond.

On TikTok, Wingstop U.K.’s following has grown bigger than the legendary cult chicken company KFC; Demand is so high, that Wingstop now has 47 sites and employs over 2,000 people—with plans to open up to 100 stores over the next five years just to keep up; It’s in the top 10 most popular restaurants in the entire Kingdom on Deliveroo and is currently one of the fastest-growing restaurants in the nation.

This interview has been edited for brevity.

The finances

Fortune: What has been the best investment you’ve ever bought?

Tom Grogan: My apartment in Hampstead Heath is my best investment. It has increased c.30% in value over the past five years, predominantly through buying very well and a tasteful refurbishment.

The worst?

Nothing too catastrophic to date to be honest!

How do you commute to work?

It’s a 45-minute walk from my apartment or on a busy day, I’ll take an Uber.

Do you carry a wallet?

Cardholder, or Apple Pay.

What personal finance advice would you give your 20-year-old self?

If I were advising my 20-year-old self on personal finance, I’d stress that merely saving money isn’t enough to build substantial wealth because it often doesn’t keep pace with inflation. Instead, the real key to wealth is creating and building something valuable, like a business or product. Think about solving a problem or fulfilling a need within a market you are passionate about. The potential financial rewards from ownership and capital gains can far surpass what you could save from a salary.

What’s the one subscription you can’t live without?

Spotify—my favorite artists at the moment are Mind Against, Dave, and Benny Banks.

Where’s your go-to watch from?

Audemars Piguet.

The real key to wealth is creating and building something valuable, like a business or product.

What’s your go-to work wardrobe?

For my work wardrobe, Suitsupply and Boggi are great. M&S men’s knitwear is also bulletproof. My favourite brands include Goyard, Berluti and Loro Piana as they all have a strong heritage and make great quality pieces.

The necessities

How do you get your daily coffee fix?

I’m a big fan of coffee and have two to three black coffees throughout the day (or double espressos). Usually I don’t eat breakfast, but when I do it’s always something light. Grind makes great tasting coffee, and thankfully there is one just by our offices in Mayfair. Our old office had a Sage coffee machine which looks great but is a faff. We now use a Nespresso machine which is much easier!

What about eating on the go?

I tend to meal prep or buy food for the day from my local gym, Third Space, which usually ends up costing around £20 ($25.3) a day. For food on the go, my favourites include Leon, Salad Project and of course Wingstop! My go-to order is eight boneless pieces in spicy Korean—you need to try the new Voodoo fries! For more sit-down lunches, Cecconis or Delfino in Mayfair are always a good choice.

Where do you buy groceries?

M&S Food and Waitrose. I rarely dine out unless it’s business or work-related.

What’s the price of unwinding from a top job?

I’ve found that cutting out alcohol and training regularly in the gym six times a week has really helped me unwind and handle the challenges that running a high-growth business can put your way—I would recommend it to anyone. Weekend walks on Hampstead Heath with my headphones in are a weekly occurrence.

The treats

Are you the proud owner of Meta’s smart glasses or anything other futuristic gadgets?

Nothing too futuristic, however I can’t live without my Airpods!

What’s the best bonus treat you’ve bought yourself?

I would say an Audemars Piguet Royal Oak Offshore Diver watch was probably the best treat. I thought about buying a nice car this year; however, I chose to be sensible and paid down some of my mortgage which I’m pretty thankful for now given where interest rates have landed!

The Amalfi Coast in Italy

Take us on holiday with you, what’s next on your vacation list?

The past few years I haven’t really been able to detach from work or take a proper holiday—personally, I find it hard to relax whilst being away from work or the office for too long. That said, I love the South of France, my business partner recently hosted us in Antibes, and I’ll most definitely be looking to return this year for a long weekend. The Amalfi Coast is on my bucket list, so I’ll be making some time to visit there in the next few years.

Business Daily,https://www.businessdailyafrica.com/bd/markets/capital-markets/packaging-firm-skol-applies-to-list-on-the-nairobi-bourse-4676804,2024-07-02,13:50:00 UTC,Packaging firm Skol applies to list on the Nairobi bourse,"Packaging solutions provider, Shri Krishana Overseas Ltd (Skol), has applied for listing on the Growth Enterprise Market Segment (Gems) of the Nairobi Securities Exchange (NSE), official documents revealed.

Gems is a segment for small and medium-sized companies that enables them to raise capital and accelerate their growth within a regulatory environment. The segment offers companies flexible listing requirements in recognition of the company’s growth phase.

Fillings show that Nairobi-based Skol targets to enter the market via listing by introduction but subject to approval by the Capital Markets Authority (CMA).

Listing by introduction happens when a company takes its existing shares and lists them on an exchange to raise capital at a later date when required.

The planned listing by Skol is earmarked for August this year in an arrangement where Synesis Capital is the lead transaction advisor while MWC Legal is serving as the legal advisor.

Aside from the constraint of not being able to raise capital, listing by introduction is often perceived to have the advantage of providing a company with a much broader base of shareholders, improved liquidity as well as enhanced profiling given the visibility provided by the exchange. Companies that go to market via introduction are, however, able to raise capital further down the road.

Other entities that went to market via introduction include Homeboyz Entertainment, which listed 63.2 million shares in December 2020 and Flame Tree Group which listed in November 2014.

The application by Skol comes at a time when the government has been at pains to end the listings drought at the NSE.

Kenya’s last initial public offering (IPO) was in 2015 when property investment fund ILAM Fahari I-Reit was listed on the NSE after raising Sh3.6 billion.

The CMA recently published revised rules that would allow more companies to list on the bourse to encourage additional IPOs and reverse a six-year drought in transactions.

As part of the radical changes, the regulator has struck out an earlier rule that restricted IPO listings to public companies limited by shares and registered under the Companies Act. A public company limited by shares is a legal entity that is separate and distinct from its members and directors or management.

The regulator also relaxed a rule on the profitability of firms seeking to go public in the main investment market segment. Currently, the law provides that an issuer must have declared profits after tax attributable to shareholders in at least three of the last five completed accounting periods to the date of the offer.","Packaging solutions provider, Shri Krishana Overseas Ltd (Skol), has applied for listing on the Growth Enterprise Market Segment (Gems) of the Nairobi Securities Exchange (NSE), official documents revealed.

The bank's acquisition positions it to offer its customers a wider range of financial services and tap into AIG's insurance experience and capabilities.

Various Kenyan banks have ventured into bancassurance including Equity with the life assurance and general insurance subsidiary businesses, KCB and National Bank, among others.

NCBA Group posted a Sh5.3 billion net profit in the first three months to March, a 4.6 percent increase compared to Sh5.1 billion reported during a similar period last year.

This increase was attributed to non-interest income growth and reduced tax expense in the review period.","NCBA Group has announced the completion of the acquisition of 66.67 percent of AIG Kenya Insurance Company to take full ownership of the company.
The lender said it had received all necessary approvals from the Competition Authority of Kenya, the Insurance Regulatory Authority, and the Central Bank of Kenya.

Business Daily,https://www.businessdailyafrica.com/bd/markets/commodities/mystery-of-russian-fertiliser-cargo-that-didn-t-reach-kenya-4676192,2024-07-02,03:00:00 UTC,Mystery of 564 tonnes of Russian fertiliser cargo that didn’t reach Kenya,"A consignment of 564 tonnes of fertiliser donated to Kenya by Russia last year disappeared in the high seas, new details show, pointing to a possible theft of the agricultural input.

The missing consignment was part of the 34,400 tonnes of raw fertiliser material Kenya received from Russia during its charm offensive to win the backing of African countries in its deadly battle against Ukraine.

The raw fertiliser material was expected to be used in tripling the production of ready-to-use product for distribution to farmers across the country, notes Auditor-General Nancy Gathungu in her latest report.

The public auditor says the missing consignment did not arrive at the port of Mombasa, suggesting it left Russia, but never arrived in Kenya.

“NCPB (National Cereals and Produce Board) received 33,835.9 metric tonnes hence a short landing of 564.1 metric tonnes from the 34,400 metric tonnes of fertiliser raw materials donated from Russia. The cause of the short landing was not explained,” notes Ms Gathungu in an audit on NCPB.

The 564 tonnes of the missing raw fertiliser would have produced 1,643 tonnes of ready-to-use fertiliser, valued at Sh197 million at the market price of Sh6,000 for a 50kg bag.

The Russian Embassy in Kenya in August last year noted that the 34,400 tonnes that Moscow donated to Nairobi would produce 100,200 tonnes of the finished product after reformulation.

“More than 34,000 tonnes of fertiliser donated to Kenya by the Russian Uralchem-Uralkali Group are now being reformulated to produce 100,200 tonnes of fertiliser. This will help Kenya a lot to get a good harvest this year,” the Embassy stated on August 3, following the landing of the input in the country.

Upon reformulation, the fertiliser (34,400 tonnes) would have a Sh12 billion market value. Russia’s donation came amid increasing prices of the input globally.

The price of fertiliser soared in the wake of Moscow’s full-scale invasion of Ukraine in February 2022, as sanctions imposed on Russia limited availability of natural gas, a main input for nitrogen fertilisers such as ammonia and urea.

This hit farmers financially while some, especially in Africa, stopped using fertiliser altogether, hampering yields and deepening a food crisis.

Since then fertiliser prices have eased as natural gas prices have come down, but Europe’s fertiliser industry is still struggling as Russian imports take a bigger share of the market.

The price of a tonne of fertiliser shot to peak at Sh87,510 in 2022 when the Russia-Ukraine war broke, but eased at Sh68,849 last year. Producing 51.9 million tonnes annually, Russia ranks as the third largest fertiliser producer globally, trailing the US which produces above 54 million tonnes, and India with an annual production of 52.6 million tonnes. It is not clear at what point the 564 tonnes of fertiliser donated to Kenya by Russia went missing.

The fertiliser disappeared in the middle of claims that NCPB distributed fake fertiliser through a subsidy programme. Eighty percent of legislators present in Parliament voted in favour of removal of Agriculture Cabinet Secretary Mithika Linturi for allegedly flouting constitutional provisions on integrity and the prudent use of public resources, according to the motion in the National Assembly.

The minister is alleged to have approved the “procurement and distribution of fake fertiliser.” He escaped the impeachment.

Yesterday, Mr Linturi did not respond to requests for comment on the whereabouts of the missing fertiliser, which could be applied on between 15,000 and 30,000 acres of land, at the rate of 50kg/acre to 100kg/acre.

The Auditor-General also notes that the NCPB has not produced a breakdown of costs associated with the raw material of fertiliser, including shipping cost, transportation cost from the port to the granulator and handling costs. The costs would shed light on how much the NCPB spent to have a 50kg bag of the finished product.

“In the circumstances, the accuracy and completeness of the fertiliser granulation costs and the quantities of the various fertilisers granulated could not be confirmed,” Ms Gathungu says.

The government continues to maintain the importance of the fertiliser subsidy programme, committing about a fifth of the budget to the agriculture sector to the programme.","The 564 tonnes of the missing raw fertiliser would have produced 1,643 tonnes of ready-to-use fertiliser, valued at Sh197 million at the market price of Sh6,000 for a 50kg bag.

Business Daily,https://www.businessdailyafrica.com/bd/economy/murkomen-on-the-spot-for-delay-lowering-expressway-toll-fees-4676186,2024-07-02,03:00:00 UTC,Murkomen on the spot for delay lowering Expressway toll fees,"The Kenyan government has delayed lowering Nairobi Expressway toll charges despite the falling inflation and strengthening of the shilling against the dollar, boosting the earnings of the Chinese firm that owns the road.

The Business Daily has established that the Ministry of Roads and Transport is sitting on an advisory from the Kenya National Highways Authority (Kenha) to lower the toll charges that were reviewed upwards on January 1.

The highways authority, which regulates the expressway operations, reckons that the strengthening of shilling and lower inflation should trigger a drop in the toll charges.

“We had mentioned the need to reduce toll fees to the PS,” said a top official at Kenha, who sought anonymity given the sensitivity of the matter.

“The adjustment could be at the CS’s whims and they (the contractor) have no control. It is the CS who can gazette.”

The current toll charges were based on inflation at 6.85 percent and the shilling at Sh143.75 against the dollar.

The shilling has since February extended gains against the dollar as Kenya’s settlement of the Eurobond that matured in June calmed investors, pushing the local currency to Sh129.50 from Sh157.32 at the start of the year.

Inflation also dropped to a 44-month low of 4.6 percent in June compared to 6.6 percent in December, bringing the cost of living measure to within the State’s target range of 2.5 percent to 7.5 percent.

After the adjustment of toll fees in January, motorists driving saloon cars from Mlolongo to Nairobi Westlands saw their user fees increase by 38.9 percent to Sh500 from the rate of Sh360 that had been set earlier in April 2022.

Driving the same vehicle from Westlands to Jomo Kenyatta International Airport (JKIA) costs Sh410, an increase of more than a third from Sh300. The toll for the distance between Museum Hill and the JKIA.

Motorists had hoped for lower rates to be announced from July 1 in line with macro-economic changes.

The law gives the Cabinet Secretary for Transport the powers to adjust the toll rates downwards if inflation falls and the shilling strengthens as part of the public private partnership (PPP) that the country inked with the Chinese contractor — Moja Expressway, a subsidiary of China Road and Bridge Construction (CRBC).

On December 19, Transport Cabinet Secretary Kipchumba Murkomen issued a Kenya Gazette notice announcing the higher charges that took effect on January 1.

The reluctance to reduce the toll rates has parallels with the rocket-and-feather pricing where upstream changes are adjusted upwards at rocket-speeds while the lower prices come down at the pace of a feather.

Monday, Mr Murkomen did not respond to requests for comments via calls and text messages.

The State opened a window allowing the Chinese company to adjust the Nairobi Expressway toll charges annually based on inflation in fees that will be paid in dollars. The inaugural toll charges were based on the dollar trading at Sh103.79 and reviewed based on inflation and the rate of the shilling to the dollar. This technically means that the toll charges are dollar-based and will cushion the Chinese operator from exchange rate losses. It has since reviewed the rates upwards twice.

The Chinese firm is expected to earn an estimated Sh106.8 billion profit for the 27 years it will own the double-decker road.

The expressway involves a four-lane and six-lane dual carriageway within the existing median of Mombasa Road/Uhuru Highway/Waiyaki Way and 11 interchanges or exits and entry routes that act as toll ramps.

The toll charges are forecast to generate Sh302.5 billion revenues, which will offer the Chinese firm an annual profit of Sh3.9 billion.

At Sh3.9 billion, CRBC’s forecast annual earnings from the double-decker road dwarfs the profits of the majority of firms listed on the Nairobi Securities Exchange (NSE) — underlining the outsized cash the expressway will generate over the 27 years.

Toll fees were introduced in the late 1980s but were scrapped in the mid-90s in favour of the roads maintenance levy currently charged at Sh18 per litre of petrol and diesel.

The return of toll fees is the result of using private investments in State infrastructure to build roads, energy plants and housing, with investors recouping their cash from charging user fees.

Kenya is seeking to maintain the pace of spending on new infrastructure with funding from private backers while reducing borrowings and the budget deficit.

The government is planning for more highways to be constructed through the PPP arrangement, depending on the success of the two.","The highways authority, which regulates the expressway operations, reckons that the strengthening of shilling and lower inflation should trigger a drop in the toll charges.

“We have dropped the Finance Bill. What does that mean? It means we have gone back almost two years. It means that this year, we are going to borrow Sh1 trillion to be able to run our government,” said Dr Ruto.

Interestingly, even after saying that borrowing would increase, from the initial target of Sh597 billion to Sh1 trillion, the President still claimed that the rejected Finance Bill would have huge consequences on certain expenditures the government had lined up.

“It means we will not confirm the JSS (Junior Secondary School) teachers, 46,000 of them; it means we cannot support the farmers with Sh2 billion for us to make sure that farmers get a fair return of Sh50 per kilo per milk; it means cannot sort out the coffee debt; it means we cannot support the cherry,” said the President.

Other victims of the decision by the government to shelve the finance billion from widespread protests include sugar cane farmers in Mumias, said the head of state. He added that Kenya will continue importing potatoes, to the chagrin of local producers.

Additionally, in the same interview, President Ruto agreed with the push to scrap the controversial offices of the First Lady as well as those of the spouses of Deputy President Rigathi Gachagua and Prime Cabinet Secretary Musalia Mudavadi.

But with the conflicting statements, the President has only added more confusion on the budget for the fiscal year starting this month.

The budget is a balancing act. The expenditure and revenue sides have to balance. On the expenditure side, is the spending by the national government (Executive, Parliament, and Judiciary) and the 47 counties. And on the revenue side, there are taxes, non-tax revenues, grants, and loans.

If the President increased the borrowing target to Sh1 trillion, the country’s total spending would remain at Sh3.997 trillion. Increasing the borrowing by Sh403 billion to Sh1 trillion would mean a Sh57 billion increase in the size of the budget.

But on June 28, when President Ruto passed the Appropriations Bill, which he said would “guarantee continuity of government operations, especially in providing critical services,” he had a different perspective. He did not talk of the government increasing borrowing, but he talked of reducing expenditure including by his office.

“I have therefore assented to the Appropriations Bill 2024 and instructed the National Treasury to immediately prepare supplementary estimates to reduce expenditure by the amount of revenue that was expected to be generated by the rejected Finance Bill,” said Ruto in a statement.

“The reduction in expenditure, amounting to Sh346 billion, will be borne eaquitable by both levels of government: the national and county governments. With respect to the national government, the reduction will be borne by the Executive, the Legislature, the Judiciary, and our constitutional commissions,” added the head of State.

In his speech, while rejecting the Finance Bill on Wednesday last week, President Ruto had called for expenditure cuts to cover the expected shortfalls in revenues, including allocations to the Executive.

Dr Ruto, whose administration has come under pressure for wasteful spending since the anti-tax protests started, directed for implementation of austerity measures that would involve expenditure cuts affecting all levels of government.

“I direct that operational expenditure in the Presidency be reduced to remove allocations for the confidential vote, reduce travel budget, hospitality and purchase of motor vehicles, renovations, and other expenditures,” he said.

The Finance Bill 2024, which has since been withdrawn following widespread protests that left scores dead, had intended to raise an additional Sh346 billion through various tax measures including the introduction of a 2.5 percent motor vehicle tax, the raising of excise duty on airtime and mobile money transfer fees.

Other tax measures in the condemned Finance Bill include the introduction of value-added tax (VAT) on bread, and increased excise duty on alcoholic beverages, cigarettes, and gambling. There was also a new eco levy that was to be applied on finished imported goods that were deemed harmful to the environment.","“We have dropped the Finance Bill.

The system hitch has caused a major backlog in the approval of dialysis sessions, inconveniencing thousands of patients with the life-threatening condition.

Patients fully reliant on NHIF have been forced to raise alternative cash to pay for dialysis or miss out on the treatment.

Jonathan Wala, chairman of the Kenya Renal Association, said that the NHIF has linked the situation to the initially planned switch to the new Social Health Insurance Fund (SHIF) on July 1. The shift to SHI has since been postponed to October 1, 2024, amid challenges with the digital platform designed to support contributions and registration into the scheme.

“Patients in need of dialysis in various hospitals have been forced to wait since there are a lot of claims that have not been approved because of the slow system. This is also causing a lot of confusion for both the healthcare providers and the patients,” he said.

“The challenges NHIF has created, the small transition time window, and the job security threat faced by employees makes this transition from NHIF to Social Health Authority (SHA) an even more precarious one,” Dr Wala added, noting that stand-alone dialysis centres are particularly affected by the issue as they have no other source of income apart from NHIF reimbursement. The stand-alone centres exclusively deal with renal ailment.

NHIF members are entitled to two dialysis sessions per week, each costing Sh9,500, bringing the total annual payment to an average of Sh960,000.

Healthcare providers have also reported technical problems with the main NHIF service portal, making it difficult to serve patients who now forced to pay cash for healthcare services. The system failure on the main NHIF portal was first reported on Friday.","A glitch in the National Health Insurance Fund (NHIF) entered its second week Monday, dealing a blow to patients reliant on it for payments towards kidney dialysis.

The lenders booked a pre-tax profit of Sh73.5 billion in the first three months of this year, new Central Bank of Kenya (CBK) data shows. The pre-tax profits earned in the three months to March represent a 12.9 percent increase on the Sh65.1 billion the banks realised over the same period last year.

The higher sector’s profit also indicates the industry’s resilience and agility to grow income amidst high interest rates and loan defaults.

“Quarterly profit before tax increased by Sh25 billion from Sh48.5 billion in the quarter ended December 2022 to Sh73.5 billion in the quarter ended March 2024. The increase in profitability was mainly attributable to an increase in quarterly income by Sh9.1 billion and a decrease in quarterly expenses by Sh15.9 billion,” CBK indicated.

The continued rise in profitability has been delivered against the backdrop of a faster drop in total operating expenses as the lenders’ incomes grow at a slower pace.

The overall drop in banks’ operating expenses has been despite rising costs to secure customer deposits and the requirement for higher provisions from rising loan defaults.

Top banks have nevertheless struggled to cut their overall expenses, pressured by high-interest expenses on customers from their huge deposit holdings and higher loan defaults.

Equity Group for instance saw its first quarter total operating expenses rise to Sh29.6 billion from Sh23.1 billion, as the bank nearly doubled its loan-loss provisions to Sh6 billion from Sh3.4 billion.

The lender however grew its net profit for the period by 25 percent as its first-quarter income climbed to Sh15.3 billion from Sh12.3 billion previously.

Its peer KCB also struggled with higher expenses in the opening quarter as interest costs hit Sh18 billion from Sh11.5 billion while loan-loss provisions were higher at Sh6.3 billion from Sh4.1 billion.

KCB however posted a quarterly profit of Sh16 billion from Sh9.5 billion previously on higher income.

Stanbic Bank Kenya was among the few outliers in the tier I category having trimmed its non-interest related expenses in the quarter to Sh4.7 billion from Sh5.6 billion on lower other expenses.

The lender however contended with higher interest expenses at Sh5.6 billion from Sh2.4 billion previously.

The bank posted a 2.7 percent rise in net profit in the quarter to Sh3.9 billion, a marginal change from a Sh3.8 billion net income in March 2023.

The banking industry's total assets declined by 2.7 percent in the three months to Sh7.5 trillion from Sh7.7 trillion in December, on the decrease of gross loans and advances to customers which fell to Sh4 trillion from Sh4.1 trillion at the end of 2023.

“The decrease in gross loans was largely witnessed in the manufacturing, personal and household, trade and real estate sectors. The decrease was mainly due to the foreign exchange rate decline. Foreign currency loans dropped from Sh1.2 trillion in December 2023 to Sh990.2 billion in March 2024,” CBK added.

Total deposits were, however, higher in March at Sh5.8 trillion from Sh5.5 trillion at the end of December even as foreign currency deposits dropped from Sh1.9 trillion to Sh1.6 trillion in the same period.

The industry’s asset quality meanwhile deteriorated further on rising defaults with the rate of non-performing loans spiking to 15.7 percent, from 14.8 percent at the end of the prior quarter.

Banks' capital and liquidity ratios however remain strong at 18.6 percent and 53.6 percent against a statutory requirement of 14.5 and 20 percent respectively.","Commercial banks’ profits jumped 12.9 percent in the three months to March on the backdrop of cost-cutting measures and higher income from loan interest charges, setting the stage for continued dividend and executive bonus boom.
The higher sector’s profit also indicates the industry’s resilience and agility to grow income amidst high interest rates and loan defaults.
“Quarterly profit before tax increased by Sh25 billion from Sh48.5 billion in the quarter ended December 2022 to Sh73.5 billion in the quarter ended March 2024.

NSE data shows that foreign net portfolio flows to the bourse in June were, however, lower than May’s Sh1.49 billion—a pointer to some waned appetite among the investors.

The net purchases trend by the offshore investors nonetheless stood for a third month since April when they took up Sh1billion worth of stocks --signifying the return of the external investors to the bourse.

Foreigners remained buyers of locally listed stocks in June, representing the third straight month of purchases by offshore investors which affirms confidence in the domestic market.

The consecutive foreign inflows to the NSE mark the extended confidence in the market by foreigners who were previously sellers, with the exits being driven by concerns about foreign exchange availability and better returns from higher interest rates in advanced economies.

The raising of interest rates by the Central Bank of Kenya (CBK) has improved the attraction of the local market to foreigners, while the improvements in the exchange rate have provided liquidity for offshore investors, allowing them to enter and exit the market at will.

A stronger Kenyan shilling has moreover sweetened the deal for the foreigners with dollar returns from the NSE peaking at 63.44 percent as of the end of May allowing investors cashing out to get more dollars for the same value of stocks sold in local currency after the rally.

The dollar returns from Kenya on a year-to-date basis have outperformed the average return of 5.95 percent from frontier markets according to the Morgan Stanley Capital International (MSCI) index.

Foreigners portfolio flows into the NSE, so far in 2024, currently stand at Sh644.7 million factoring in selloffs seen in the first three months of the year before the shifting of the tide.

The local bourse has also benefited from the favourable reviews including the end of restrictions on the availability of foreign exchange by the MSCI and the FTSE Russell indexes.

Kenya had been placed under the watch of the two investor service providers in 2022, following reports of foreign investors facing difficulties in accessing dollars from the local forex market to repatriate dividends and proceeds of share sales.

The red herring dented investor confidence by discouraging flows while forcing holders to hold off from selling in dollar-starved markets.

The NSE had expected the reclassification of the bourse to boost inflows from the foreigners.

NSE’s attraction to offshore investors has gotten a further lift from the inclusion of KCB Group to the MSCI frontier market index which has increased the counter’s visibility to foreigners.

KCB has joined Safaricom, Equity Group, and East African Breweries Plc who are already constituents of the frontier market index which captures large and mid-cap stocks across 28 markets.

Foreign investors are an integral part of the NSE bourse based on their active participation in trading activity.

Average foreign participation as a share of equity turnover has recovered from a low 30.1 percent in March 2023 to 62.84 percent in March this year according to additional data from the NSE.","Offshore investors bought a net Sh419.5 million worth of shares on the Nairobi Securities Exchange (NSE) in June, extending the trend to a third straight month.

In a scandal exposing leakages within the Fund managing billions of shillings belonging to Kenyans, Auditor-General Nancy Gathungu reveals that in the year to June 2023, NHIF paid Sh814.9 million claims yet hospitals only billed Sh447.12 million through some 10 schemes.

The NHIF then blamed the excess payment on “typing errors” by hospital clerks, but could not provide proof of either having recovered the excess payments or asked the hospitals to reconcile the data, Ms Gathungu reveals.

“Review of payment data revealed that the hospitals billed Sh447,122,141 against claims paid amounting to Sh814,893,467 resulting to unexplained variance of Sh367,771,326,” Ms Gathungu said in her report on NHIF.

The audit reveals that in the year to June 2023, out of Sh37.1 million that different hospitals billed NHIF with regards to the Linda Mama scheme, the Fund paid Sh91.6 million (Sh54.5 million in excess).

In total, NHIF reported paying claims totaling Sh4.1 billion relating to Linda Mama Programme- which supports free child delivery for all women in the country.

The audit notes that claims relating to the programme were filled with possible cases of fraud, including instances of multiple duplications.

“The amount includes an amount of Sh5,713,000 paid to NHIF accredited hospitals whose analysis revealed 656 duplicate case code (01) on caesarean section deliveries procedures carried out on the same patient. Similarly, the amount includes a balance of Sh41,332,700 whose analysis revealed 10,860 duplicated case code (02) on normal deliveries on the same patient,” the audit notes.

Under the National Health Scheme (NHS) the audit also exposes instances of duplications and excess payments. In one instance while hospitals billed the Fund Sh280.6 million through the NHS Scheme, the NHIF paid Sh486.6 million (an excess of Sh205.9 million that the Fund did not explain).

The audit also exposes that out of a Sh12 billion debt owed to healthcare providers, Sh2.9 billion was found to contain “duplicated healthcare providers with the same name but different outstanding amounts and different hospital codes.”

The excess payments and duplications in claim payments were just part of the loopholes Ms Gathungu flagged in the management of the NHIF, which exposed it to loss of billions of shillings, even as patients relying on its cover continue to suffer poor services and denial of services in some instances.","The National Health Insurance Fund (NHIF) has claimed that it paid out Sh368 million in excess claims due to ""typing errors"" and has no proof of where the money went.

Home Afrika said it is looking to sell six housing units off its Mitini Scapes Development along Kiambu Road and Lake View Heights in Kisumu to repay its restructured debt facilities to the bank.

The company said as part of the debt restructuring programme, its directors engaged in negotiations with various lenders including I&M Bank, Cooperative Bank and NCBA Bank to restructure the defaulted facilities.

""During the year ended December 31, 2023, the directors negotiated a final and full settlement with the bank (I&M) of Sh100 million and the group paid Sh22 million during the year, towards settlement of the loan balance,"" said Home Afrika.

""The outstanding balance of Sh79 million will be repaid in the next financial year from proceeds realised from the sale of six housing units under Mitini Scapes Development Limited and the sale of 5 acres of land under Lake View Heights Limited in Kisumu.""

The firm did not disclose how much it had borrowed from I&M Bank and other lenders but in the year ended December, borrowings from I&M Bank amounted to Sh78.9 million from Sh141.3 million in 2022.

The loans were secured by Sh1.3 billion worth of guarantors including a mortgage, debenture and an indemnity corporate guarantee both personal and joint, from the directors.

The developer also has borrowed funds from lenders after failing to raise money privately from a bond issue in 2014.

""The management negotiated for full and final settlement of Sh320 million and Sh460.95 million with Cooperative Bank and NCBA Bank Kenya Plc respectively during the year under review.""

The property firm said the negotiations were key in bringing down their finance costs by 37 percent in the year under review while borrowing and private bonds also decreased by 25 percent. The firm is also in battle over an asset with Ecobank after failing to repay a facility.

The bank went to court to liquidate the asset but the high court ordered the pan-African bank to repurchase the property at market value.

The company got funds from financial institutions Ecobank and I&M Bank to fund its Moru Ridge and Mitini projects respectively in 2013.

It is here, in Karen, that Jacqie’s beautiful garden comes to life and her four-bedroom mansion nears completion.

Ms Abuga takes us through her journey of home ownership.

“I bought this quarter-acre piece of land for Sh5 million in 2011 and left it fallow until 2016. Back then there was no road. I didn’t initially plan to build a home, the plan was to hold on to it and let its value appreciate. But things took a turn when I got access to fairly priced mortgage facilities,” explains Ms Abuga.

Then came her dilemma; whether to buy or to build a house.

“With the mortgage, I could afford ready-made houses that were way out of town, but they didn’t have a garden. So I figured, I could build on the piece of land.”

Having decided to build on the piece of land, Ms Abuga had to contend with the steep terrain that her land lay on.

“It took about a year to get the plans in place because first, the architect did not take cognisance that the land was not flat as his drawings indicated. Of course, there was a way we could lower the ground level. Unfortunately on one side of the land is a huge slab of rock which would have required that I blast it with dynamite, a process that would affect my neighbours,” Ms Abuga tells the BDLife.

So she got a new architect.

“The new architect was like ‘but this is already a solid foundation. We can build on it instead of digging deep into it,” Jacqie says.

When she started building she then realised “there will be empty places in some parts of the house which meant an additional room I had not budgeted for, so the cost went up,” she notes.

The bank was not happy about the changes so even with the mortgage she had to dig deep into her pockets to build her house.

“I started gardening in 2016 as the house was being constructed. I started with the kei apple fence and the bougainvillaea on the front because it is very beautiful and at some point in the year, around March and November, it is filled with pink and white flowers. In 2018, when I moved here, I added the duranta.”

Gardening journey

Ms Abuga grew up on a farm in Kericho where they had a lot of space and grass. “I’d always tell myself that if I had my way, I would design the garden in a particular way. I never actualised my dream in my parents’ compound so when I got this place, I said, ‘This is now the time for me.”

Her Karen land being a very hilly place, Ms Abuga needed to level the ground to create her garden. She spent almost Sh1 million on terracing to create different levels and layers of the garden.

“I used a lot of stone and red soil to backfill this garden. I had to get the levels right before I started landscaping. This was done all while the house construction was taking place. It was quite costly but I was determined to make it a garden so I didn’t stop at anything,” says the communication specialist.

She adds, “I grew up on a farm where we got all the food from the farm. The only thing we ever bought was sugar and flour. I was determined to have that for myself.”

Jacqie’s garden is divided into three levels.

The white garden

The first level is her white garden which is still coming into shape. “If you look there is no flower here that is of a different colour. It is all green and white. Even the rose here is white.” At the centre is the fragrant yesterday today and tomorrow flower.

The Arabica grass

The second level of her garden is the masterpiece. This is where her well-pampered Arabica grass resides.

“I have uprooted the grass three times until finally, I settled for Arabica. Everyone will discourage you and tell you that Arabica is very stubborn and is hard to grow. I agree it’s a very needy type of grass because it needs a lot of water and fertiliser. The first two types of grass I had planted were not very ‘carpety’ or bouncy. There was first, Kikuyu grass, which attracts weeds so it becomes difficult to maintain. Then there as the Zimbabwe grass which is okay but it is the grass that you are growing when you are not trying hard enough. But with Arabica grass, if you take care of me, it will take care of you,” the mother of two fondly says about her one-year-old grass.

On this second level, the grass grows on its own and on the edges grows her trees.

“I decided that I will not have any plants on the grass so that in case I have a function, I have a place to host the guests. Surrounding this area (the second level) is the bamboo which I want to form a boundary fence between the garden and the pathway. For the trees, my most treasured one is the araucaria pine tree. I have always wanted a pine tree so that come Christmas time we are able to drape it with lights,” she tells us.

Other trees in the garden are the Thika palms and the traveller’s palm.

The vegetable garden

The third level of Jacqie’s garden is her vegetable garden where she grows her tomatoes, kales, spinach and fruit trees including the loquats, tree tomatoes, bananas, oranges, and hass avocado trees.

Ms Abuga utilises various items to hold her plants. Apart from used cans, car tyres are also used as planters.

“Every time I have a changeover of tyres I come and use them in the garden. My wheelbarrow broke down, so I painted it white and here it is now with some plants.

The grand entrance

In Jacqie’s garden is an array of potted plants neatly arranged as you climb the stairway to her house. At a distinct position is her Irish ivy that is held by circular wire and the dark pink anthurium growing on the same pot.

The potted plants give you a warm embrace as you get into the house.

“Part of the reason I have this stairway is because of the terrain. I did not want to sink my house lower so I was like ‘Why don’t I have a grand entrance into the house?’ I love pink so you’ll notice that most of my potted flowers have a little pink here and there,” she explains.

Apart from the healthy anthuriums, as you walk into Jacqie’s house you’ll get to experience the beautiful fuschias, the all-seasons jade plant and the purple-pink Egyptian starcluster.

Taking care of the garden

Having a beautiful well-maintained garden does not come cheaply.

“Because of the rains at the moment, I don’t need to water the garden but when it is dry, we water every morning and evening. When there is no rain, my water consumption shoots up by at least Sh2000 a month. In a month, I spend around Sh15,000 on maintaining the garden depending also on the plants I have to buy. I mostly work with a gardener who comes in twice a week to maintain it. Gardening is a journey, today you think you’re okay then tomorrow you have a light bulb moment and think ‘I could change this or add that plant. Your love for gardens has to come from within for you to care about it,” says Jacqie who prides herself on having created the garden at her workplace.

Her biggest challenge has been the termites “because there is red soil so you have to do the termite fumigation often. Moles also come in to destroy the plants.”

Advice for homeowners

For those seeking to own a home, Ms Abuga advises, that you consider the terrain of the land as you settle on the mortgage. You should also get a like-minded architect.

“You need someone who is not stiff and can tap into your dream. Get someone who is flexible, creative and can think out of the box. Bear in mind that there will always be unforeseen costs,” she says.

Being present during the construction is essential.","Jacqie Abuga’s house is the ‘house on the hill.’ As you get into her driveway you climb up a steep hill.

The World Bank said it debarred the EY Kenya after investigations revealed it was guilty of conflict of interest and corruption in two public programmes in Somalia.

EY Kenya was found in breach of the bank's code of conduct relating to the Somali Core Economic Institutions and Opportunities Program (Score) and the Second Public Financial Management Capacity Strengthening Project (PFM II).

“According to the facts of the case, EY Kenya failed to disclose a conflict of interest during the selection and implementation of four contracts under the Score and PFM II projects, and the involvement of an agent in those contracts,” read the statement from the WB published on June 26.

“In addition, during the execution of one of the contracts, EY Kenya made a provision for allowances to be paid to project officials. This conduct constitutes fraudulent and corrupt practices under the World Bank Consultant Guidelines.”

The sanctions dent EY Kenya’s reputation because potential clients or even partners may keep off for fear of association with a tainted firm. This can lead to a loss of business opportunities and a decrease in competitive edge in the market.

EY Kenya is the latest Kenyan firm to have been blacklisted by the WB on any projects being financed by the Washington-based institution.

“It is part of a settlement agreement under which the company admits culpability for sanctionable practices and agrees to meet specified integrity compliance conditions as a requirement for release from debarment. “

The World Bank said EY Kenya is expected to develop and implement an integrity compliance programme that reflects the principles set out in the WB Integrity Compliance Guidelines.","Audit firm, Ernst and Young, Kenya (EY Kenya) faces blight on its reputation after the World Bank (WB) debarred it from its projects and programmes for two years, citing conflict of interest and corruption.

Business Daily,https://www.businessdailyafrica.com/bd/lifestyle/personal-finance/protect-myself-from-my-financially-irresponsible-spouse-4676082,2024-07-02,00:00:00 UTC,How do I protect myself from my financially irresponsible spouse?,"These are unprecedented economic times. Businesses and investments have become tricky to run. And sometimes, marital relationships are built on foundations that might be considered sandy.

Some people end up together only based on the financial benefits they receive from their partners. Nowadays, it is not uncommon for spouses to help each other out in financial matters concerning the household.

The growth and a couple’s standing in society is also considered not only in terms of the family’s size (children) and careers of the spouses but also their financial muscle and assets accumulation.

However, financial or money matters are also among the leading causes of strain in many marriages. When hard times happen in most unions, it is not unheard of that a partner will walk away from the situation.

Some even refuse to bail out the other if they feel either the finances required will endanger the financial capabilities of the family or the risk is too high. Sometimes, a spouse can find themselves locked out of what they thought were investments or properties they thought were matrimonial property.

Matrimonial property

Matrimonial property is any property that you acquire during the subsistence of the marriage. However, matrimonial property can only be put in place where no other law supersedes it.

For example, unless spouses open a joint account when putting money in financial institutions, then whoever is stated as “next of kin” or “beneficiary” gets left with the money after the demise or incapacity (physical or mental inability to manage one's affairs).

Martha Nzomo, an accredited financial adviser working at ICEA Lions Group helps individuals, companies and groups invest their money depending on their short-term, medium-term and long-term needs. She also helps do pension transfers and consolidation.

“In my experience, not everyone automatically puts their spouses as next of kin. Because it’s not a must, I can put my father, mother, sister or brother. Unless I come and update that later,” says Ms Nzomo.

She says people prefer putting the names of people they trust in the beneficiary’s clause of their investment products’ forms as you don't need to put your spouse. Others say they are doing that to diversify and ensure there’s no family conflict since they’ve already put their spouses on their other investments.

Joint accounts

In instances where couples want to have a short-term savings account, like a money market account where you can access money from time to time, the company’s policy is that they must have opened a joint bank account where the money can be deposited when making withdrawals.

“Today, we may have been on good terms and we opened a joint money market account. But along the way we fall out. Who are they then supposed to pay that money to? How are they supposed to favour one party over the other? We can’t pick sides,” says Ms Nzomo on the reason for the policy.

However, for things like school fees policy, because it is done through consent. The couple can decide to who the money is sent in the end; after maturity of the policy.

Outline financial obligations

However, she believes that agreeing that the financial obligations that they each individually had before coming together should stay separate and not automatically consolidated is the best way.

“Whatever you did with your money, that’s yours. Whatever I did with mine, that’s mine. However, you need to state what the purpose of opening a joint account is, like family trips or the children’s future education. Always make sure the mandate (how the account is to be run) requires both of your consents; on everything,” says Ms Nzomo, who has been in the industry for slightly over 10 years.

Read the fine print

Another thing you might want to also do is make sure you read all documents on matters financial that a spouse brings to you with regards to assets or accounts you hold together. The law states that ignorance is not a defence, and that also comes down to where a spouse claims they did not know what the other person was attaching as collateral to loans taken for various reasons.

“You may have owned a piece of land, but while in a marriage you built on that piece of land. The buildings then become matrimonial property while the land remains individual property. Matrimonial property is co-owned with your spouse even if they did not contribute money in their acquisition through what is called contribution in kind. However, the other spouse has to have knowledge of the dealings of the other or else they won’t be able to claim these,” says Christine Muthoni, an advocate of the High Court.

After divorce

After a divorce, the next thing that happens is the division of property. If you have a lawyer, you will file a suit called a declaration of interest in matrimonial property. A good lawyer will file this even before filing for division of matrimonial property; pending hearing and determination of the divorce; to ask for an injunction giving a list of the properties one knows they own so that they are not interfered with.

Interference may include transfer of ownership to either one’s mother or a company they have registered, or selling off of some property whose benefits they believe the other spouse shouldn’t be able to enjoy.

Even inheritance received during the subsistence of a marriage becomes matrimonial property and the other spouse is entitled to a share of that, says Ms Muthoni.

“If you don’t want your spouse to interfere with anything you acquired before or during your marriage, I encourage people to do pre-nuptial agreements. Disclosure is important. You list down everything and say in case of a divorce, the property I have before the date of the marriage cannot be touched,” adds the certified divorce coach, by the International Coach Federation – ICF, who is a published author with her book Conscious Uncoupling.","Sometimes, a spouse can find themselves locked out of what they thought were investments or properties they thought were matrimonial property.

Business Daily,https://www.businessdailyafrica.com/bd/lifestyle/gardening/gardenpreneurship-shirley-kadoch-flower-factory-4675786,2024-07-01,23:00:00 UTC,Gardenpreneurship: Shirley Kadoch turns city gardens into works of art,"A garden naturally breathes life into a home. But to elevate it into a work of art, infusing the right shades of colour is essential.

When Shirley Kadoch moved to Kenya from her country in the Middle East almost a decade ago, it struck her how most Kenyan homeowners were reluctant to experiment with colourful flowers and plant. It was always a dash of colour here and there in a sea of green.

“I have always loved flowers. Back in my country, I was a garden designer,” says Shirley.

She wanted to continue her career in garden design, but the local market was less vibrant.

“I realised that though roadside vendors had some good varieties, they didn’t have everything I was used to,” she says of the moment she decided to open a flower shop.

As a designer, I always look for bright colours. I wanted to offer a varied and beautiful mix of colours and greenery,” says Shirley.

In the last few years, her Flower Factory in Karen, Nairobi has helped homeowners create magnificent gardens. Retailers and corporates have also been turning to her to make their gardens awe-inspiring spaces.

Business journey

Starting a business can feel like playing snakes and ladders, with its ups and downs.

For Shirley, resilience and a strong passion for bringing together a unique collection of flowers and creating beautiful gardens have helped her navigate the tough entrepreneurship landscape in Kenya.

“It started as a small shop and slowly grew into something big. Now, as you can see, it looks magnificent,” says Shirley.

Current operations

Nestled within the tranquil Talisman Restaurant in Karen, the Flower Factory Garden is a haven for nature lovers. Shirley says the name of the garden was informed by her anticipation of producing numerous flowers. What began with just three flowers has now grown into a vibrant collection of houseplants, herbs, and fruit trees.

The garden also offers hanging baskets, stylish pots, and essential gardening tools. This carefully curated collection, Shirley says, aims to add colour and vitality to both indoor and outdoor spaces.

“Here you will experience the perfect blend of gardening simplicity and fun, all in a unique environment that reconnects you with nature,” she says.

Varieties

The Flower Factory is home to more than 30 species of potted plants, including the short-lived, tender Argyranthemum that blooms in full sun, the ornamental Calibrachoa which grows best in a pot, and Chrysanthemum, Dahlia, Dianthus, Fuchsia Jollies, Gaura, and Gerbera, each with more than three varieties.

The large number of varieties allows her to maintain a wide range of stock for her customers.

“We are always adding more and more. Each time we introduce something new to keep our customers interested. Once you have a bag of flowers, you keep coming back for more,” she says.

Her favourite flower, the petunia, comes in up to five varieties in pink, red, white, and purple, for both standing and hanging pots. It is also a top seller.

“I love the colours, the shape, and the fact that it comes in so many varieties,” she says.

Because they are annuals, Ms Kadoch stresses that they should be replaced every six months.

“I usually recommend using mostly perennials in your garden and leaving a small area for seasonal colour. Since adding colour with annuals is not expensive, you can change it twice a year and still have an amazing effect,” she notes.

The garden also includes Lobularia, New Guinea; an annual flower that lasts one full growing season. There are also ornamental grasses, portulaca, salvia, and sunflowers, which she buys either as seeds or seedlings, and take between two and six months to flower, depending on the plant.

Herb garden

The herb garden has mint, with up to five varieties, including pineapple and chocolate, as well as lemongrass, strawberry, coriander, parsley, rosemary, thyme, curry, sage, and aloe vera.

The basil comes in three varieties, including regular, Thai, and holy basil for her Indian customers.

“I like to have a variety of plants because it attracts a lot of customers and we also want to keep it interesting,” she says.

In the middle of the garden is a bird bath decorated with petunias to add to the fun. Water and seeds are added to attract birds to the garden, creating an almost complete ecosystem.

Flower Factory's most prized possessions come from local growers, major stores, and their farm in Athi River, where they grow many of their flowers.

Her clients include China Square, Carrefour supermarkets and other companies through partnerships.

“Not everyone likes to come to Karen, so we try to reach them everywhere,” she says.

Challenges and successes

“The business is hard, hectic, but it’s fun. The turnover, half of it goes to our customers, the partnerships, so it doesn’t represent our profits. But we are not complaining. We are constantly investing in equipment, greenhouses, and agronomists to train our staff,"" says Shirley.

She adds, “We face challenges such as climate change affecting sunlight, excessive humidity leading to bacterial growth, and reduced shelf life.”

Surrounding oneself with beautiful plants has a positive effect on mental health and well-being. The 44-year-old mother of three says that flowers and gardens have always made her feel younger.

Future plans

Looking ahead, she is striving for improve her business. Her team, which has grown from three to nearly 50, serves as a vital support system. She credits their strength and dedication for keeping her motivated.

The success of the Flower Factory, she says, also depends on loyal customers who return for more plants and advice.","In the last few years, her Flower Factory in Karen, Nairobi has helped homeowners create magnificent gardens.

A money recovery suit is a legal mechanism that allows individuals or entities to seek payment of outstanding dues through a civil court.

Mombasa Resident Judge Olga Sewe noted that the recovery suit would be the most efficacious way for Mombasa Fresh Water Supply Company to benefit from a judgement issued in its favour last year.

“I am therefore satisfied that the application is compliant. Leave be and is hereby granted to the firm to file an application for the issuance of an order of Mandamus against the KPA to compel the payment of the decretal sum of Sh32.1 million awarded in Mombasa High Court Civil Case No. 75 of 2018,” she said.

Justice Sewe further noted that the stance taken by KPA against the Mombasa water firm's application for leave was unsustainable.

The company, led by its director Peterson Mitau, approached the court following their victory in a case against the parastatal last year.

According to Mr Mitau, KPA had failed to comply with a directive requiring it to provide a bank guarantee within 30 days after successfully applying for a stay of the execution of the judgment in the form’s favour.","A water supply company has been allowed by a court to file a recovery suit, compelling the Kenya Ports Authority (KPA) to pay Sh32.1 million in pending bills for supplies made five years ago.

Speaking at the Carbon Markets Conference in Nairobi in April, Bianca Gichangi, a carbon markets expert and adviser at the Office of the Climate Envoy, Executive Office of the President of Kenya, said the country has been active in the carbon markets space for more than two decades and is a leader in Africa with around 23 percent market share of voluntary carbon credits issued.

According to Ms Gichangi, carbon markets are prioritised as a pivotal component of Kenya’s climate-positive growth and carbon credits are envisioned as the next major export.

This is why on the path to realising this vision, Kenya has marked notable strides by establishing robust legal and institutional frameworks through amending the Climate Change Act to incorporate carbon markets and is close to finalising regulations that provide clarity on implementation.

But what is carbon trading and what are carbon markets?

Dr Olufunso Somorin, the regional principal officer of, the climate change and green growth programme for East Africa at the African Development Bank Group(AfDB) said we are in an era where we need trillions, if not billions to respond to the devastating impacts of the climate crisis.

“There is an international mechanism under Article 6 of the Paris Agreement that sets out how countries can pursue voluntary cooperation to reach their climate targets.

“It enables international cooperation to tackle climate change and unlock financial support for developing countries.”

This, he says, means that under Article 6, countries can transfer carbon credits earned from the reduction of greenhouse gas emissions to help one or more countries meet their climate targets.

Through this mechanism, a company in one country can reduce emissions and have those reductions credited for sale to another company in a different country.

That second company may use them to comply with its emission obligations or to help it meet net-zero targets.

Dr Somorin said there are three tools countries can draw upon under Article 6, one of which is the Paris Agreement Crediting Mechanism (PACM)—the UN’s new high-integrity carbon crediting mechanism.

“This international mechanism allows possible projects for climate mitigation such as carbon sequestration—the process of capturing and storing atmospheric carbon dioxide to reduce the amount of the gas in the atmosphere in efforts to ease global warming—to happen in developing countries paid for by a country paid for by a country or entity in a developed country.

“So if you can’t fully achieve emissions reduction in your country because of the system, there’s an opportunity for you to achieve emissions reduction in another country, and that reduction in another country generates carbon credits which can be sold by the country supplying those credits to the countries that are in demand of those credits, that trading is what the carbon markets are about, it’s a very complex market,” he said.

The expert adds that there is a very big difference between carbon trading and greenwashing.

“One key element of the carbon market is that it is a trust market, when I pay you to generate carbon credits, you have to do it. Greenwashing is misleading the public to believe that an entity is doing so, it promotes false solutions to the climate crisis that distract from and delay concrete and credible action.”

Greenwashing manifests itself in several ways, including claiming to be on track to cut a company’s emissions when no credible plan is in place, being purposely vague about a company’s operations or materials used, applying intentionally misleading labels such as “green” or “eco-friendly,” which do not have standard definitions and can be easily misinterpreted, implying that a minor improvement has a major impact, or promoting a product that meets the minimum regulatory requirements as if it is significantly better than the standard.

According to the UN, the science is clear.

“Greenhouse gas emissions, such as carbon and methane, from human activities are wrapping the Earth in a blanket of pollution that has warmed the planet and led to severe impacts such as more intense storms, droughts, floods, and wildfires.

Greenwashing undermines credible efforts to reduce emissions and address the climate crisis. Through deceptive marketing and false claims of sustainability, greenwashing misleads consumers, investors, and the public, hampering the trust, ambition, and action needed to bring about global change and secure a sustainable planet.”

This is why, according to Ms Gichangi, Kenya will soon be unveiling frameworks to promote high-integrity carbon market activities and provide an enabling policy environment for investment and flow of carbon finance into enhancing energy access, safeguarding our terrestrial and marine ecosystems, boosting agricultural yields, and contributing to green industrialisation.

“There’s an opportunity to build technical capacity and generate employment for our burgeoning population. End-to-end integrity in carbon markets is crucial to ensuring the credibility and effectiveness of carbon market activities, providing confidence to investors and stakeholders that carbon credits represent genuine environmental and social benefits. It safeguards against double counting and fosters transparency that enhances trust in the carbon market system,” she said.

Ms Gichangi added that last year, at the world’s biggest climate meet in Dubai (COP28), President William Ruto launched the Africa Green Industrialisation initiative, building upon the Nairobi Declaration, with a vision to propel green industries in the country and on the continent.

Kenya, endowed with abundant renewable energy, aspires to boost its renewable energy production from 3GW to 100 GW by 2040. This ambitious goal will position Kenya as a premier green industrial hub, attract international ventures, and foster the adoption of carbon management technologies, she said.













According to the government, the rise of e-mobility in Kenya is set to reduce reliance on fossil fuels, mitigating urban air pollution and enhancing public health.

“Carbon revenues can subsidize electric vehicle technology, promoting its adoption while leveraging more climate finance through public-private partnerships.

Additionally, the country aims to address energy access challenges by utilizing carbon finance to subsidize transformative high tier clean cooking technologies, benefiting 45 million Kenyans without access to clean cooking by the end of the decade,” Ms Gichangi added.

Dr Somorin agrees with Ms Gichangi that the ordinary Kenyan can and will benefit from all this.

“The question should be how can an average group of people within a defined scope of project benefit?”

Here explains that there is an opportunity within the carbon market structure which is an incentive market for the ordinary people to benefit but in order for that to happen it has to be done at scale which means people have to register as a group or community and do projects together.

This is because the cost of transacting most carbon projects is very high which is why one has to do it at scale for it to make economic sense.

“This is why we have been here for two days; to discuss how we can turn carbon market opportunities in priority sectors into real investment.

We have been expounding on different innovative finance models and the role local financial institutions can play in supporting private sector project developers as well as unpacking the complexities of pricing and building infrastructure to enhance integrity, transparency, and accounting, “MS Gichangi said.

On the question of the amount of land / trees needed to execute carbon trading initiatives, Dr Somorin told climate action that there are multiple approaches when it comes to removing carbon dioxide from the atmosphere.

“Some of the opportunities that give the biggest emission reduction are largely land-based first of all which is why there’s a lot of interest in trees and forests, this is what we call nature-based solutions.

The reason for this is because of the biology of life, a tree absorbs carbon dioxide from the atmosphere and releases oxygen and so when you have millions of trees the more photosynthesis happens but when it comes to how many trees one needs, there’s no straight answer, this is because no two trees sequester carbon the same way.”

He explains that there is a difference in sequestration between an older tree and a younger one, there’s also a difference in sequestration between a tree in Europe and a tree in Africa as well as tiny trees that are fast growing and huge trees that are slow growing.

“We have an advantage in Africa because the type of tree species that we have here are the best when it comes to sequestration globally, that’s why there is a lot of interest.”

Apart from trees, he points out that biofuels can also be used for carbon trading.

Dr Somorin reminds that the world is on the threshold of transitioning from the petroeconomy, fuelled by carbon from the past, to the bioeconomy, fuelled by biomass created through photosynthesis.

The petroeconomy is overwhelmingly carbon positive—contributing carbon to the load already imposed, and increasing at the rate of approximately eight gigatonnes per year.

The bioeconomy is widely considered to be carbon neutral, in that the carbon emitted through burning replaces the carbon absorbed during the growing of the crop.

However, a furious debate has been ongoing over the real degree of carbon neutrality achieved by biofuels, with some produced in temperate climates such as North America and Europe being argued to be almost entirely carbon positive, due to the heavy inputs of fossil-fuelled activities and products such as fertilizers.

“If you shift from fossil fuel powered systems to clean energy systems such as hydro, geothermal, wind or solar energy that is a potential carbon project and in fact some of the geothermal projects in Kenya have been funded through carbon finance,” he told Climate Action.

Ali Mohammed, the special envoy on Climate Change at the Office of the President of the Republic of Kenya said that contrary to what many people have been saying, the government does not do carbon credit deals in secret.","According to Ms Gichangi, carbon markets are prioritised as a pivotal component of Kenya’s climate-positive growth and carbon credits are envisioned as the next major export.

Among these methods is body transformation, where actors either add or lose a lot of weight in the process of ""becoming"" the character.

A good example would be 50 Cent in All Things Fall Apart (2011), and of course, Christian Bale, who is known for taking on various forms and sizes for different projects. Lupita Nyong'o has now joined this group. If you've been following her over the last few months, you may have noticed her frail appearance, which at times had her fans concerned and worried. With time we came to discover that the weight was for movie which just came came out (June 27, 2024)

So, did the sacrifice and effort she put into the project pay off?

A Quiet Place: Day One

A Quiet Place: Day One is a 2024 American apocalyptic horror film written and directed by Michael Sarnoski. It is based on a story by Sarnoski and John Krasinski, which is the third installment in the A Quiet Place film series. This installment acts both as a spin-off and prequel to the previous films.

Lupita stars as a terminally ill woman navigating the early stages of an invasion in New York City by extraterrestrial creatures with exceptionally acute hearing. The supporting cast includes Joseph Quinn, Alex Wolff, and Djimon Hounsou, reprising his role from the second film.

Heads up

This is a blockbuster summer movie; however, unlike your conventional apocalypse film, it isn't solely about action and explosive scenes with an indestructible protagonist. Instead, it focuses much more on character development. Don't get me wrong. The action and creatures are still there, but the director and producers clearly understood the caliber of actors at their disposal and chose to fully capitalise on their talents.

So, if you are going into this expecting an action creature feature, consider yourself warned.

What works

The exposition in this film is handled very well. Rather than spoon-feeding the audience, the screenplay allows the story and character arcs to evolve organically. Visual cues play a significant role in advancing the narrative, particularly since silence is pivotal in the film, forcing actors to rely solely on expressions.

The performances are outstanding. Alex Wolff, nearly unrecognisable, delivers a fantastic performance, and Joseph Quinn adds an intriguing layer to the story.

However, the standout is Lupita. She fully embodies her character, and her physical transformation adds profound visual depth to her portrayal. Her ability to convey emotions through facial and physical expressions is the cornerstone of the film. Although her character's motivation may seem unconventional, it remains clear throughout the movie.

The character development is also impressive. The protagonist is already going through a lot from the outset, and following her journey through the invasion stimulates empathy from the audience.

Another memorable character is Frodo the cat, whose atypical behavior contributes to some of the film's most tense moments.

The movie is full of tense and anxiety-inducing scenes, consistent with the thematic motif of the Quiet Place series.

While the creatures deliver expected terror with impressive visual effects and design, they take a secondary role in this character-driven narrative.

The cinematography beautifully captures New York City before and after the invasion, complementing the story's nature. Additionally, the costumes effectively define each character's personality.

Nitpicks

As mentioned earlier, it's important to emphasise: don't expect an action-packed alien invasion movie as the trailers might suggest.

While it stands as a worthy counterpart to the first two films, in terms of creature innovation, this installment doesn't introduce anything significantly new. Additionally, the story structure may feel somewhat familiar.

Final Word

While watching this movie, I found myself thinking of making this article more about why Lupita might be one of the best actors of this generation rather than focusing on a conventional movie review. She is really good in this film.","A Quiet Place: Day OneA Quiet Place: Day One is a 2024 American apocalyptic horror film written and directed by Michael Sarnoski.

According to the 32nd edition of the Cybersecurity Report by the Communications Authority of Kenya, the mind-boggling surge includes sophisticated malwares and social engineering scams that target corporate IT systems by duping employees to share their logins and passwords online.

Cybercriminals are constantly evolving their tactics that have enabled them to siphon cash from would-be victims inflicting devastating financial losses on unsuspecting companies. This growing threat has made a strong case for cybersecurity or cyber insurance, which offers a critical safety net for operating in this environment.

And online presence being a key lifeline for every company and government entity, every entity has no options but to maintain active online through their websites, software applications for both their internal and external customers.

Cyber insurance goes beyond traditional firewalls, providing businesses with financial protection against cyberattack-related costs.

This includes covering expenses related to data recovery, forensic investigations, legal fees, and even credit monitoring for affected customers.

Looking at the devastating impact that cybersecurity has on businesses, insurance is a worthy investment.

In 2022, for example, a new report released by global cybersecurity firm Trend Micro shows Kenya’s losses to cyber criminals reached Sh3.6 billion ($36 million), compared to Nigeria and South Africa where they are nearly tenfold at Sh50 billion ($500 million) and Sh57 billion ($570 million), respectively.

While cybercrime is now a grim reality, Kenya still lags in cyber insurance product development with the main challenge being a severe deficit of cybersecurity expertise. Kenya has a paltry 2,000 personnel mainly working for private firms compared to the current demand of between 40,000 to 50,000. The situation calls for urgent mitigation with each sector defining its cybersecurity needs.

For the insurance industry, the rigorous underwriting process and financial capacity needed to support it has become a key hindrance affecting most insurance companies’ ability to develop new products. To circumvent the challenges, insurance companies must adopt new technologies such as machine learning, artificial intelligence and data analytics to generate new solutions for a myriad of challenges being witnessed.

As we move along in technological advancement, a cyberattack is no longer a matter of “if” but “when” it will occur. That is why all businesses need to secure a cyber insurance policy to be cyber-ready. For all stakeholders in the sector, a challenge lies ahead on how to make the product readily available, affordable and tailored to the needs of those who need it.","This growing threat has made a strong case for cybersecurity or cyber insurance, which offers a critical safety net for operating in this environment.

This integration is not just a response to global sustainability trends but a proactive move to address local and regional challenges. By adopting ESG frameworks, insurance firms can contribute significantly to the sustainable development of the country.

The integration of ESG principles is transforming the industry, not just by altering investment patterns and underwriting practices, but by reshaping the very ethos of insurance companies. This transformation is driven by the recognition that long-term sustainability and profitability are inextricably linked to the well-being of the environment and society at large.

In Kenya, where the effects of climate change are discernible, the insurance sector's role in environmental stewardship is critical. By offering innovative products like Index-Based Flood and Crop Insurance, insurers are providing a safety net for those most vulnerable to climate-related disasters. These initiatives not only offer immediate financial relief but also encourage sustainable agricultural practices and disaster preparedness, contributing to the resilience of local economies.

Socially, the insurance industry's impact is profound. Through micro insurance offerings, insurers are bridging the gap in financial services for the underserved, fostering inclusivity and security. These programmes are more than just a business strategy; they represent a commitment to social equity and the upliftment of disadvantaged communities. By partnering with healthcare providers, insurers are also playing a pivotal role in improving health outcomes and promoting preventive healthcare, which is essential for the long-term health and productivity of the population.

Strong governance in insurance sector ensures accountability and transparency, which are vital for investor confidence and consumer trust. By adhering to international standards and best practices, Kenyan insurers are setting a precedent for ethical conduct and responsible business operations. This commitment to governance extends beyond compliance; it is about building a legacy of integrity that will define the future of the industry.

Moreover, ESG-focused insurance companies can influence public policy by advocating for regulations that support sustainable development. They can also collaborate with non-governmental organisations and the private sector to launch initiatives that address pressing ESG issues. Through these actions, the insurance industry can become a catalyst for positive change, driving economic growth while also ensuring the well-being of the environment and society.

The insurance sector's embrace of ESG is a testament to its adaptability and foresight. It reflects a deep understanding that the path to sustainable growth is paved with responsible practices that consider the broader impact on society and the environment. As the sector continues to evolve, its alignment with ESG principles will undoubtedly play a pivotal role in shaping a resilient and sustainable future for Kenya.","Kenya's insurance sector is poised to play a transformative role in integrating Environmental, Social, and Governance (ESG) principles into its operations.

Business Daily,https://www.businessdailyafrica.com/bd/opinion-analysis/columnists/it-is-time-for-tax-laws-amendment-bill-4675898,2024-07-01,21:00:00 UTC,It’s time for Tax Laws Amendment Bill,"On June 26, President William Ruto declined to assent to the much-contested Finance Bill 2024, and in an unprecedented move directed that the bill be withdrawn in its entirety through deletion of all 69 clauses it contained.

National Assembly Speaker Moses Wetangula has since transmitted the President’s directive to the Assembly’s Finance and Planning Committee, which is expected to report back to the House upon resumption on July 23.

It is my prayer that among the proposals to be tabled by the Committee upon resumption will be the consideration of a Tax Laws Amendment Bill designed to salvage the progressive proposals that were contained in Finance Bill 2024 yet ended up being a victim of the withdrawal of the Bill in entirety.

How do we salvage the proposal to extend the just ended Tax Amnesty Programme from the June 30, 2024 sunset date to the March 31, 2025 that was proposed in Finance Bill 2024 via amendment to Section 37E of the Tax Procedures Act?

The extension of the Tax Amnesty Programme would be of particular benefit to Kenyans given that according to the National Assembly Finance and Planning Committee as at June 25, 2024, the amnesty programme had mobilised Sh31 billion against the targeted Sh51 billion, translating to a performance rate of just 60.8 percent.

How do we salvage the proposal to increase the quantum of allowable pension deduction from Sh20,000 to Sh30,000 and in so doing provide the much-needed boost for workers disposable incomes even as they create a safety net for their sunset years? This was a very welcome proposal in Finance Bill 2024.

Still on pensions, how do we salvage the proposal to migrate Kenya’s pensions system from exempt-exempt-tax to exempt-exempt-exempt and in so doing, ensure that when senior citizens finally tap into their accrued pension benefits, they are spared the tax that currently comes with it? Not only was this a proposal in Finance Bill 2024, it is a core pillar of the National Pensions Policy.

How do we salvage the proposal to increase the allowable deduction when contributing to a post-retirement medical scheme from Sh10,000 to Sh15,000 and in so doing, make the prospect of preparing for one’s post-retirement medical expenses a lot more attractive?

This was a very important and much needed proposal in Finance Bill 2024. Data from the Retirement Benefits Authority shows that the average lumpsum payment by pension schemes to a retiree in Kenya is Sh1,956,727. And that the most common uses of this lumpsum is paying off loans, medical bills and children’s school fees. That aspect of using one’s pension lumpsum to settle medical bills needs to be addressed in this country.

How do we salvage the proposal to amend the tax free per diem rate from the current Sh2,000 per day to five percent of an employee’s gross monthly income? This proposal was extremely welcome since it was designed to create an incentive to have proper accountability around per diem payments in the country.

Another proposal that was contained in Finance Bill 2024 that ought to be salvaged is the one to increase the amount allowable for deductible purposes when it comes to employees’ non-cash benefits from the present Sh36,000 ceiling to Sh48,000. This proposal was designed to provide more headroom for employees to enjoy non-cash benefits from employers without increasing their taxable income.

How do we salvage the plan to introduce Advance Pricing Agreements between taxpayers and the Kenya Revenue Authority (KRA), and in so doing enhance the certainty with which parties engaged in transfer pricing arrangements are dealing with the taxman?

A tax laws amendment bill is not a strange phenomenon in this country. Kenyans will remember that it was through the Tax Laws Amendment Act No.1 of 2020 that the government undertook Covid-19-related tax measures designed to provide a stimulus for the crisis-hit economy.

It is through the Tax Laws (Amendment) Act No.1 of 2020 that the corporate income tax rate for resident companies was revised downward from 30 percent to 25 percent. It was also this Act that provided much needed reprieve for small businesses when it expanded the ceiling for Turnover Tax eligibility from the initial Sh5 million to Sh50 million as well as reducing the Turnover Tax rate from three percent to one percent.

I believe in the prevailing unprecedented environment, just like it did during the unprecedented Covid-19 environment, a Tax Laws Amendment Bill could be used to unlock these gains for Kenyans.","It is my prayer that among the proposals to be tabled by the Committee upon resumption will be the consideration of a Tax Laws Amendment Bill designed to salvage the progressive proposals that were contained in Finance Bill 2024 yet ended up being a victim of the withdrawal of the Bill in entirety.

Recent data from the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development World Investment Report 2024 paints a concerning picture: foreign direct investment (FDI) inflows to Kenya dipped by $93 million (about Sh12 billion) in 2023 to $1.504 billion from $1.597 billion the previous year or 5.85 percent decline.

This is a stark reminder that Kenya’s attractiveness to foreign investors is waning compared to its regional peers.

The primary culprit behind this decline is clear—bureaucratic red tape. Despite significant strides in digital government services, including the lauded eCitizen platform, investors continue to grapple with a labyrinth of regulatory requirements.

The multiplicity of licences and permits required at national and county levels has created a difficult environment for doing business. This bureaucratic morass not only deters new investments but also hampers the expansion plans of existing enterprises.

Kenya’s predicament becomes even more apparent when viewed in the context of its East African neighbours. Ethiopia, once considered a less favourable investment destination, has surged ahead, accounting for a staggering 29.07 percent ($3.26 billion) of the region’s FDI inflows.

Similarly, Uganda, despite its smaller economy, attracted $2.89 billion in FDI, representing a 2.37 percent growth. Even Tanzania, traditionally seen as a less dynamic economy, saw its FDI grow by 5.85 percent to $1.34 billion. These figures underscore a shifting landscape where Kenya’s traditional advantages—strategic location, skilled workforce, and relatively advanced infrastructure—are no longer sufficient to maintain its competitive edge.

The implications of this trend extend far beyond mere statistics. FDI is a crucial driver of growth, bringing not just capital but also technology transfer, expertise, and access to global markets. As Kenya aspires to achieve middle-income status and create jobs, attracting and retaining foreign investors becomes paramount.

President William Ruto’s administration has recognised the potential, identifying renewable energy, housing, manufacturing, agriculture, and ICT as sectors with the greatest potential to attract investors. However, identifying potential is only the first step. The real challenge lies in creating an enabling environment that allows these sectors to flourish and attract the desired investment.","This is a stark reminder that Kenya’s attractiveness to foreign investors is waning compared to its regional peers.

The Office of the United States Trade Representative (USTR) in a newly published report said that Kenya exported products worth Sh65.77 billion ($510million) to the US under the Agoa scheme in 2023, bucking a growth trend from the previous year when Washington took up goods worth Sh66.88 bllion ($517million) from the country.

“Kenya, Madagascar, and Lesotho were significant suppliers of apparel under Agoa in 2023,” USTR said in its report, noting that overall US apparel imports from all Agoa-legible countries, however, fell to $1.1 billion (Sh141.88 billion) in 2023 from $1.4 billion (Sh180.57 billion) in 2021.

The dip in Agoa fortunes means that Kenyans missed a dollar windfall through 2023 when the shilling plummeted to record levels against the greenback. The shilling hit record low of 160.75 against the dollar in January after bad run throughout 2023—which meant good tidings for exporters paid in dollars.

More than half of Kenyan exports to the US are comprised of clothing, macadamia, coffee, titanium ores and concentrates, and black tea. Three-quarters of US-bound exports benefit from duty-free access to the US under the Agoa.

The Agoa pact, first enacted in 2000 before renewal for 10 years in June 2015, allows duty- and quota-free access to the US for thousands of products like food and beverages, wood, plastics, and rubber from sub-Saharan Africa, but Kenya has largely tapped the apparel line.

The Agoa is due to expire next year with President Joe Biden’s administration keen to extend it. The US Congress has put down proposals that would see Agoa extended to 2041, thus remaining in effect for 16 years.

Senators Chris Coons (Democrat-Delaware) and James Risch (Republican-Idaho) in April this year introduced the bipartisan Agoa Renewal and Improvement Act of 2024, which would see Agoa cover 54 out of the previous 32 African countries.

The extension is expected to integrate Agoa with the African Continental Free Trade Agreement to support the development of intra-African supply chains.

Kenya has long sought a sustainable full free trade agreement with the US outside of the two-decade-old Agoa deal, but progress has been dragged by regime change in both countries.

The two countries are locked in negotiations under the US-Kenya Strategic Trade and Investment Partnership (Stip) whose terms Kenya and the US started stitching together in July 2022 before the end of former President Uhuru Kenyatta’s term in office.

The US, however, maintained that the Stip will not graduate Kenya out of Agoa, which the US trade representative was keen to renew upon expiry mid-2025, subject to approval by lawmakers – the Congress.

The Stip targets wide areas of governance, investment, climate change, agriculture, and trade facilities in areas such as customs procedures.

For example, in agriculture, the US and Kenya negotiating measures to facilitate agricultural trade and enhance transparency besides improving Sanitary and Phytosanitary (SPS) measures.

The two countries are negotiating on fighting graft through information sharing of best practices to prevent and combat bribery and corruption and will explore negotiating specific commitments.","The dip in Agoa fortunes means that Kenyans missed a dollar windfall through 2023 when the shilling plummeted to record levels against the greenback.

EU-Kenya Economic Partnership Agreement (EPA), which preserves unrestricted access of Kenyan goods to the European bloc except for arms, came into force on Monday, Kenya’s Cabinet Secretary for Investment, Trade and Industry Rebecca Miano announced.

“The EU-Kenya EPA is one of the most ambitious agreements negotiated between the European Union and an African country in terms of promoting economic sustainability. It can serve as a template for other African countries, particularly those in Eastern Africa to adapt,” Ms Miano said in a statement.

“The agreement includes trade, economic and development cooperation and a chapter on trade and sustainable development which covers provisions on labour issues, gender equality, forestry and environment and the fight against climate change.”

The pact, the first trade agreement between the EU bloc and a developing country, ensures Kenya’s largely agricultural produce such as vegetables, cut flowers, fruits, tea and coffee continue to enter the bloc duty-and quota-free.

Nairobi, on the other hand, has committed to gradually lower duty on imports from Europe within 25 years after which trade will be liberalised.

This means no duty will apply for goods from Europe such as machinery as well as mineral and chemical products, while investments from the EU will also be incentivised.

The EPA deal, however, has a protectionist clause which bars the EU from applying blanket subsidies to agricultural exports to Kenya in the absence of a deepened policy dialogue with Nairobi. This clause is aimed at safeguarding agriculture and food security in Kenya against unfair competition from the EU.

Trade between the two parties favours the EU, which sold goods worth Sh223.12 billion to Kenya, while importing Sh150.08 billion.

The enforcement of the EU-Kenya EPA comes after approval from the European Parliament on February 29, paving the way for heads of State and government to complete the ratification process.

Some 366 EU lawmakers voted in favour of the deal with 86 members rejecting it, while 56 members abstained.

Kenyan lawmakers also approved the document for it to become enforceable.

The document is largely a modification of the text in the stalled EU-East African Community pact, which was first agreed in October 2014 subject to approval by respective parliaments. The major change is the inclusion of clauses around climate change.

The implementation of the EU-EAC treaty, which Kenya endorsed in 2016, had stalled after the other EAC countries rejected it.

Rwanda signed but did not ratify, while Tanzania and Uganda refused to approve the pact for various economic and political interests, including the fear of European goods flooding the market.

Unlike Kenya, which is a lower middle-income country, the other EAC countries are shielded from higher tariffs on exports under the ""everything but arms"" trade arrangement for least-developed countries.

This is provided for under the World Trade Organisation’s (WTO’s) Special and Differential Treatment (S&D) because they are the least-developed countries (LDCs).

The refusal to cooperate by EAC peers prompted Nairobi to enter into a temporary special arrangement with the EU, which has allowed Kenya’s exports to continue accessing the EU markets duty- and quota-free.

The EAC Heads of State Summit in February 2021, however, allowed partner members to sign bilateral trade deals on condition that they leave room for other EAC countries to join in future.

Kenya and the EU have utilised this window to re-engage on the pact, leaving the door open for other EAC member States to join when they choose to.","Kenya and the European Union have enforced a trade deal after a decade of negotiations, opening up the domestic market for tax-free goods from the 27-country bloc after 25 years.

The refurbishment of Dar port has seen the number of containers entering the inland container depot (ICD) increase by more than 16 fold to 100 containers in 12 hours from six within the same amount of time, while the number of containers ferried by a single truck in 24 hours to 36 hours has increased from one to six.

“It is beneficial to the port because I can see a lot of competition by the private sector. It is a sign of improvement for the port,” says Emmanuel Mallya, an expert in port issues in Tanzania.

“We are seeing positive prospects for the growth of the port. We used to bring to our ICD six containers for 12 hours. Now for 12 hours we are bringing more than 100.”

Dar Port and Mombasa Port play pivotal roles in the East African maritime trade, serving as primary gateways for international trade, facilitating the smooth flow of goods and functioning as transhipment hubs within the region.

The two ports' efficiency affects regional integration, economic growth and trade.

Port users are already seeing early dividends in the shift to allow private players to run the port at a time when Tanzania is working to attract more cargo to its shores.

According to Mr Mallya, a truck initially used to take between 24 hours to 36 hours to bring one container to the ICD but things are changing and currently one truck brings up to six containers.

“All our inland container yards are now full of containers. We don’t know where to send additional ones,” he says.

Dar port serves countries such as Malawi, Zambia, Eastern DRC, Burundi, Rwanda, Zimbabwe and Uganda while Mombasa caters to Uganda, South Sudan, Northeastern DRC, Burundi, and Rwanda.

Tanzania has handed over the operations and management of its maritime sea assets to Dubai’s DP World and India’s Adani International Ports Holdings (AIPH) for a period of 30 years.

The country hopes to overhaul the performance of its maritime assets and strategically position Dar port to compete effectively with the port of Mombasa.

Mombasa port bypassed its main regional competitors, Djibouti and Dar es Salaam in the latest World Bank global ports index over ship delays and non-tariff barriers.

The Container Port Performance Index (CPPI) 2023, shows that the port of Dar es Salaam dropped 55 places from 312 to 367, blamed on inefficiencies while increasing business bottlenecks in the Djibouti port, a facility touted as the region’s maritime hub, resulted in a drastic drop from position 26 in 2022 to 379 in 2023.

DP World and the Tanzanian government signed a deal in October 2023 for the Emirati logistics company to manage two-thirds of Dar es Salaam port for the next 30 years. Under the deal, DP World will operate and modernise the multi-purpose Dar Port.

DP World will initially invest more than $250 million to upgrade the port and the investment could increase to $1 billion during the concession period, alongside hinterland logistics projects.

The agreement aims to optimise the port’s operations to improve transport and logistics services throughout Tanzania and its hinterland.

Adani has also been granted a 30-year concession to manage Dar es Salaam port’s Container Terminal 2, which includes four berths and has an annual cargo handling capacity of 1 million Twenty-Foot Equivalent Units.

With this development, foreign investors now control eight out of 12 berths at the facility.

Kenya is also considering privatisation initiatives for multiple berths at the Mombasa and Lamu ports.

Last year, the Kenya Port Authority invited investors to express their interest in leasing port infrastructure through public-private partnerships.

Dar Port, handles 90 percent of Tanzania’s trade, clearing $15 billion of merchandise annually.

DP World has begun to enhance the port's efficiency with new equipment and systems, promising significant economic benefits for Tanzania and its neighbouring countries.

Recently, the port witnessed the operation of ship-to-shore cranes for the first time, powered by mega generators moved into the terminal by DP World.

This new infrastructure enabled the completion of the first sulfur vessel in a record four days, marking a historic milestone for the port.

Additionally, the modernisation efforts have allowed the longest vessel ever to dock at the port.","Dar port serves countries such as Malawi, Zambia, Eastern DRC, Burundi, Rwanda, Zimbabwe and Uganda while Mombasa caters to Uganda, South Sudan, Northeastern DRC, Burundi, and Rwanda.

Business Daily,https://www.businessdailyafrica.com/bd/economy/how-kenya-paid-sh197bn-interest-on-debut-eurobond--4675074,2024-07-01,03:00:00 UTC,How Kenya paid Sh197bn interest on debut Eurobond,"Kenyan taxpayers paid $1.53 billion (Sh197.4 billion) in interest on the 2014 Eurobond whose last instalment was repaid last Friday, underlining the heavy cost of reliance on commercial debt to fund the budget.

The interest paid is the equivalent of 55.6 percent of the $2.75 billion (Sh354 billion in Monday’s rate) that the Treasury borrowed in the debut sovereign bond in June 2014.

This bond was sold in two tranches of five and 10 years, split at $750 million (Sh96.5 billion) and $2 billion (Sh257.4 billion) and paying interest at rates of 5.875 percent and 6.875 percent respectively.

Eurobonds attract a fixed rate of interest during the life of the loan, and the principal is repaid in a bullet payment upon maturity, rather than on a reducing balance basis.

This is unlike the concessional loans whose principal amount is paid down progressively alongside interest, sparing the borrower having to pay high interest throughout the life of a loan.

Eurobond loans also pose a repayment problem upon maturity as the borrower is required to settle the principal in one go, causing foreign currency liquidity pressure on the exchequer.

For the five-year bond—which the government repaid in June 2019—the interest charge totalled $214.2 million (Sh27.6 billion). On the 10-year paper, the total interest amounted to $1.32 billion (Sh169.8 billion), owing to its higher quantum and longer tenor.

The 10-year bond was partially repaid ahead of time in February through a buyback that was financed by a new Eurobond sale. The buyback saw the State retire $1.44 billion worth of notes early, with the balance being repaid last Friday using the proceeds of a $1.2 billion loan contracted from the World Bank.

“Payment was settled on June 21. Bondholders have received their due (and) the matter is behind us,” Public Debt Management Office director-general Haron Sirima said.

At the time of issuance, the debut Eurobond was seen as a relatively cheap option for development financing owing to the prevailing low international interest rates, and therefore an alternative for domestic borrowing in order to reduce competition for credit with the private sector.

The government identified a number of infrastructure projects in agriculture, transport and energy for funding using the proceeds of the bond, although subsequent audits did not show direct allocation to the projects as had been planned.

In the energy sector, the Treasury indicated that the money would go to expanding transmission lines, and exploration and drilling of geothermal wells.

In the transport sector, the Treasury identified the dredging of the Lamu Port, which was in its initial stages of development at the time, and an urban commuter rail linking the Nairobi city centre the Jomo Kenyatta International Airport as priorities for fund allocation.

In agriculture, funding was earmarked for the Galana-Kulalu irrigation project. These projects were supposed to generate income to help service the loan, according to the initial plans by the government.

A special audit done in 2019 by the Office of the Auditor-General, however, found that the funds were likely put into general budgetary use by ministries after being transferred to the exchequer account.

This made it difficult to identify whether the proceeds of the bond were put into the specific projects that had been earmarked for funding.

Subsequent Eurobond sales have tended to go towards general funding of the budget, or repaying other maturing debt.

In February 2018, part of the proceeds of the second Eurobond sale, which raised Sh202 billion, was used to retire syndicated loans contracted in 2015 and 2017.","Kenyan taxpayers paid $1.53 billion (Sh197.4 billion) in interest on the 2014 Eurobond whose last instalment was repaid last Friday, underlining the heavy cost of reliance on commercial debt to fund the budget.

The Guardian,https://www.theguardian.com/environment/article/2024/jul/02/port-infrastructure-delays-threaten-uks-transition-to-net-zero-industry-says,2024-07-02,11:54:34 UTC,"Port infrastructure delays threaten UK’s transition to net zero, industry says","The UK’s transition to net zero is under threat as delays in approving new infrastructure put billions of pounds of investment in offshore wind schemes and other vital upgrades at risk, big ports have said.

The British Ports Association (BPA) has written to the government and Labour calling for action to clear the backlog of harbour orders, the legislation needed for ports to make infrastructure changes to support offshore wind projects.

The shadow energy security secretary, Ed Miliband, this week promised Labour will take lead on global efforts to tackle the climate crisis if it wins Thursday’s election.

Port authorities hope to take advantage of the growth of the offshore wind industry – seen as vital to hitting the UK’s legal commitment to net zero carbon emissions by 2050 – by upgrading their infrastructure to allow the assembly and maintenance of turbines on site.

Some ports, however, have been waiting for nearly four years for orders to be signed off, more than four times longer than expected, while other schemes have failed to get off the ground over fears the delays will make them unviable.

The BPA, whose members own and operate 350 ports and facilities, has estimated that it could take nearly nine years to clear all existing orders, while saying that applications are likely to increase in number in the coming years to meet growing demand for offshore wind schemes.

Harbour orders are legislative consents given to ports to construct new infrastructure by the Marine Management Organisation (MMO), a public body.

Ports also require harbour orders to give them new legal powers, enabling them to borrow funds or enter joint ventures, which are essential for the planning of facilities such as upgrades to allow work on turbines or cruise terminals.

The BPA director of policy and external affairs, Mark Simmonds, said significant port development was needed in the coming years to meet the growing demand for offshore wind, as well as growth in cargo and cruises.

“It is extremely regrettable that a single point of failure in processing relatively simple consents at a regulator can threaten billions of pounds of port investment and ultimately put our net zero ambitions at risk,” he said.

The BPA has told Labour that its £1.8bn manifesto pledge to upgrade UK ports could be held back unless immediate action is taken to speed up consents.

The number of approvals has dropped off significantly, with only four harbour orders receiving the green light in the past two years, compared with nine in 2021.

Falmouth Harbour, which has been waiting almost two years to secure a new order, said the delays were preventing it from progressing plans to tap into floating offshore wind projects in the Celtic Sea.

The harbour’s chief executive, Miles Carden, said: “The significant time delays are a massive distraction.”

The Port of Southampton submitted its application for new powers in June 2020 but has still yet to secure an order, and the Port of Plymouth has been waiting three years for MMO approval. Industry experts believe the body’s lack of legal resources is behind the delays.

Associated British Ports, the country’s biggest port operator, said the delays were unacceptable and holding up a number of its important operational improvement projects.

Tim Morris of the ABP said: “Without more capacity at the MMO or alternative routes to process applications, the potential for ABP and other port operators to grow our capability to handle the trade Britain needs and play a greater role in the energy transition risks being lost.”

Offshore wind provided about 17% of the UK’s energy in 2023, with the government targeting 50GW by 2030.

A report by Renewable UK last year estimated that investment of around £4bn would be needed at ports to produce 34GW of energy from floating offshore wind by 2040.

Lara Moore, the head of marine at the law firm Ashfords, said it was aware of projects failing at an early stage because they were unlikely to obtain consents within the two- to three-year window they needed to become operational.

“For offshore wind customers who are trying to bring in turbines, you’ve got to be able to react. You can’t say to a prospective customer, ‘yes, we are really interested but we can’t start for another four years because we are waiting for the consent’,” she said.

A spokesperson for the MMO said the application process typically takes about three years.

“The present volume of applications and the resulting perceived delays were created by the large volume of applications submitted ahead of two price increases to harbour order fees in 2022 and 2023,” the spokesperson said.

“The processing of these applications is complex and time consuming and the MMO is presently not fully cost recovering for work undertaken for this function.”

The Department for Transport said it was working with the body and ports to improve the process.","The UK’s transition to net zero is under threat as delays in approving new infrastructure put billions of pounds of investment in offshore wind schemes and other vital upgrades at risk, big ports have said.

Lawyers said it was a “watershed moment” as the courts had previously ruled that penalties for water companies were a matter for the regulator, and companies could not sue firms for damage caused to their property by sewage pollution.

The Manchester Ship Canal Company, which has been trying since 2010 to bring a claim against United Utilities, has alleged that discharges from 121 sewage outfalls within its networks constituted a trespass.

In February 2012, the high court ruled in favour of United Utilities, but this was later overturned by the court of appeal, and then restored by the supreme court in 2014. Then, in March 2021, the high court ruled it was the role of regulators and not the courts to address problems caused by sewage dumping.

The Environmental Law Foundation, supported by the Good Law Project, challenged this decision, arguing that there should be legal options for people directly affected by sewage pollution. But the court of appeal found against them and said the only option for recourse in issues caused by pollution was through the regulator, and that the law did not allow people or companies directly affected to bring private claims against the water companies.

The case then went to the supreme court, which overturned the previous rulings and found that United Utilities can be held to account for damage caused by discharges.

The court said the 1991 Water Industry Act does not prevent the company from bringing a claim for nuisance or trespass when a canal is polluted by sewage discharges from United Utilities’ sewers, even if there has been no deliberate misconduct or negligence.

Lord Reed and Lord Hodge said: “The supreme court unanimously allows the canal company’s appeal. It holds that the 1991 act does not prevent the canal company from bringing a claim in nuisance or trespass when the canal is polluted by discharges of foul water from United Utilities’ outfalls, even if there has been no negligence or deliberate misconduct.”

The Good Law Project’s interim head of legal, Jennine Walker, said: “This is a sensational victory. It gives us stronger legal tools to turn the tide on the sewage scandal and hold water companies to account, after repeated failures from our toothless and underfunded regulators.”

A United Utilities spokesperson said: “We are considering the implications of the supreme court’s ruling and the clarification of the circumstances in which private owners could bring proceedings in respect of discharges. We understand and share people’s concerns about the need for change and we have already made an early start on an ambitious proposed £3bn programme to improve over 400 storm overflows across the north-west which would cut spills by 60% over the decade to 2030.

The Guardian,https://www.theguardian.com/business/article/2024/jul/02/i-totally-understand-why-people-are-sceptical-the-co-founder-of-collapsed-energy-giant-bulb-on-his-new-venture,2024-07-02,13:00:39 UTC,‘I totally understand why people are sceptical’: the co-founder of collapsed energy giant Bulb on his new venture,"Britain’s fast-changing energy industry may be just the place for reinvention. In the wake of the unprecedented collapse of Bulb Energy, its co-founder, Amit Gudka, is trying to make the best of his next chapter: by plugging into the global battery boom.

Sitting in a central London coffee shop, not far from the offices of his new venture, Field Energy, Gudka explains how he has swapped home energy customers for battery projects and why he believes he should be given a second chance.

It has been almost three years since Bulb Energy became Britain’s biggest gas and electricity supplier to go bust amid a string of more than 20 company collapses – leaving taxpayers holding what looked to be a £6.5bn bill – and one year since Gudka successfully raised £100m for his new battery storage startup.

Gudka, 40, says he understands that there may be former Bulb customers who wonder whether he should be running another energy company. Some energy insiders share that scepticism after Bulb’s incredible rise (courting the likes of Boris Johnson on the way) and costly collapse left a deep stain on the energy supply industry.

“I can completely understand that scepticism,” he says. “When you set up a second business, you’ve already learned a hell of a lot from the first time around. There are also a lot of learnings to take away from what happened at Bulb to take into a new business as well.”

For anyone who has built a business and then seen it fail – there’s a lot of emotional attachment

The energy entrepreneur left Bulb months before the company’s stratospheric rise came to an abrupt end in the autumn of 2021 as energy market prices soared to record highs, pushing the company into special government administration.

Bulb had been the brainchild of co-founders Gudka and Hayden Wood. Gudka – a gas and electricity trader at Barclays and a DJ who ran the Man Make Music record label and club night – teamed up with Wood to launch Bulb in 2015 in the wake of a shake-up of the market by energy regulator Ofgem that was designed to encourage competition. Wood courted the limelight, evangelising about how Bulb would disrupt the lumbering energy supply market with slick tech and renewable energy, while Gudka was less public. The pair cashed out £4m each in shares in 2018.

The collapse sent shockwaves through the industry, casting Bulb’s 1.6 million customers and its 650 staff into uncertainty and threatening to saddle the government with more than £4bn in costs – a figure that had risen to £6.5bn by November 2022 as wholesale prices soared further amid Russia’s invasion of Ukraine.

As energy market prices have come down, the cost of the collapse has fallen. It is now expected to be “fiscally neutral” for the government after Octopus Energy was allowed to buy its erstwhile rival with the promise that it would pay the government back almost £3bn of state support.

For Gudka, the collapse of the company is still a sore point. “It was hard. It was pretty devastating,” he says, weighing each word carefully. He pauses. “I think anyone who has built a business and then seen it fail – whether you’re in it, or out of it – there’s a lot of emotional attachment. It was very sad. And even harder for the employees who were still there.”

Gudka had left the company nine months before its coffers ran dry, but he was still on the board of Bulb Energy’s parent company at the time of the administration and was involved in the process of winding the business down. The process is expected to complete this September.

“In the end, I think it was a good outcome for Bulb’s employees. It was a really great team and I was still in touch with a lot of them after I left,” he says.

There are no warm words for co-founder Wood. The pair, who built what was once Britain’s fastest growing startup and a darling of senior government figures, have had scant contact beyond Gudka’s attendance at quarterly board meetings.

“That was the extent of our contact. I see him at industry events and stuff,” he adds. The apparent coolness between the pair has fuelled industry rumour that Gudka’s departure followed a falling-out.

Gudka swiftly moved on, alighting on a different corner of the energy market that he saw as ripe for disruption: the growing market for storing renewable energy.

Today, Field, which is registered as Virmati Energy, operates a 20 megawatt-hour (MWh) battery site in Oldham, Greater Manchester, that can provide enough electricity to power more than two-thirds of the town’s households for one hour if called on to do so. It has another 20MWh battery project in Gerrards Cross, south Buckinghamshire, which began operation in April 2024, and a construction pipeline of projects totalling 390MWh. The business is also looking at opportunities in Spain, Italy and Germany.

Gudka characterises the move into the booming market for batteries as a return to his longstanding interests in the mechanics of Britain’s energy market.

The Cambridge University graduate was a keen observer of Britain’s energy generation capacity in his trading job at Barclays for almost seven years before he left to establish Bulb Energy.

“This brings together a lot of my energy market experience,” he says. “It had been in my mind for quite a while and by 2020 we had a glimpse at how important it is to scale up this technology.”

This was, notably, the year upended by the Covid-19 pandemic. For energy markets, the lockdown restrictions caused a sudden slump in energy demand and meant that the UK’s green electricity supplies threatened to overload the grid. That provided a temporary preview of a grid system run mostly on renewables and the importance of battery technology to store wind and solar power.

Gudka says his departure was discussed with Bulb’s board and agreed in October 2020. It was announced the following February, only a few months before a sharp rally in market prices drove its costs well beyond what it could sustain.

“The intention was to leave with everything on a stable footing,” he says. “The audit has just been signed off, there was a rolling hedging policy in place, a sizeable team and the fundraising process had been kicked off. There is always risk in business but at this point things felt pretty stable.”

Gudka believes that Bulb would have survived the energy crisis – which also wiped scores of other, smaller suppliers from the market – if the timing of its final fundraising process had been sooner.

“If it had started three months earlier, it probably would have been closed by the time the markets really started moving. At that point credit lines were pulled and it was the lack of credit in the end which ultimately led to this outcome,” he says.

Tellingly, the top lessons that Gudka says he has taken into his latest company are both financial: strong financial management and very healthy capital headroom.

He says his first move in setting up his new business, in which he holds a minority stake, was to hire a chief financial officer. He has also raised £235m in equity and £40m in debt, which he says is more than enough to carry out its plans.

Field was first backed by London-based Giant Ventures in 2021. It then raised a £77m round in 2022 – £30m in equity and £47m in debt. Its equity backers included Plural and LocalGlobe, while the debt facility came from Triple Point Energy Efficiency Infrastructure. Last year, it raised a further £200m from DIF Capital Partners.

“We’re staying ahead of the curve in terms of capital-raising,” he says.

Gudka believes investing in batteries puts him ahead of the curve on Britain’s electricity system overhaul too – and perhaps even on the road to his own reinvention.

The Guardian,https://www.theguardian.com/business/article/2024/jul/02/ms-increases-stocks-of-smaller-womenswear-sizes-due-to-higher-demand,2024-07-02,16:24:35 UTC,M&S increases stocks of smaller womenswear sizes due to higher demand,"Marks & Spencer is increasing its stocks of smaller sizes in womenswear after a surge in demand left gaps on shelves.

Stuart Machin, the chief executive of the high street stalwart, said that three years ago about a fifth (21%) of the items sold from its main seasonal collection were size six to 10 and that had now risen to 35% as its “fashion and style ranges [were] resonating with a different customer group”.

Even outside those more fashionable ranges, sales of smaller sizes now represent about 23% of the mix, a rise from about 20% three years ago.

Answering a complaint from a shopper at the retailer’s annual general meeting – that there were not enough smaller sizes in stock – Machin said on Tuesday that he had personally looked at the orders on smaller sizes to ensure there were more and “if we sell out in autumn winter we’ll be doing very well”.

The demand for smaller sizes reflects the increasing popularity of M&S, once mainly worn by those well over 50, with shoppers in their 20s, 30s and 40s who, on average tend to be slimmer.

A spokesperson for M&S, which stocks women’s clothing from size six to 24, said: “We’re not moving away from larger sizes, it’s more about getting better at responding to demand and making sure we have the right size mix and availability for all of our customers – which is something we haven’t always got right.”

In May, Machin said more under-30s were buying M&S’s lingerie than ever before, helping take its market share in that product category to a new high of 38%.

That broader appeal has help the revitalised retailer win more than 1 million extra shoppers and boost profits by 41% in the year to 30 March.

The retailer has tried to improve its fashion credentials and reach a new generation of shoppers by using social media, including training its own staff as influencers. It has also enlisted younger names than it has traditionally used in advertising campaigns, such as Sophie Ellis-Bextor and Zawe Ashton.

Tie-ups with celebrities such as Sienna Miller, the 42-year-old actor known for her style, have also been important. M&S said 10 was the most popular size in Miller’s range and 32% of items in its spring and summer campaign were in size six to 10.

On the M&S website, six of the 19 clothing items available in Miller’s collection are sold out in sizes six to 10

Pippa Stephens, senior apparel analyst at GlobalData, said M&S’s decision to start stocking outside brands such as Nobody’s Child and Sweaty Betty on its website had helped boost its appeal with younger shoppers while the design of its own-label gear now had “more fashionable shapes and prints”.

But she said that it may also be that a larger number of older shoppers were now more trim and “more aware of exercise and healthy eating”.

Machin has also rejigged M&S’s food stores so that they have greater appeal to young families, with the Essential range of cheaper basics, larger packs and enough items to make it possible to do a full weekly shop.

Dozens of investors attended M&S’s annual meeting at the Paddington headquarters, albeit many fewer than the vast gatherings the FTSE-listed company was once known for when shoppers often berated it over the length of sleeves, knicker elastic and other matters.

During the pandemic, M&S switched to holding the meetings online, but said it was now committed to a hybrid set-up.

At the meeting, the retailer had to defend its use of agency workers, such as cleaners, who are not guaranteed at least the real living wage unlike the main shop floor staff who are directly employed by M&S.

Machin and M&S chair Archie Norman also defended a decision to cut back the lifetime staff discount. Employees who had worked for the retailer for at least a decade had previously received the 20% discount, but on 1 July M&S lengthened the service period to 25 years.

Machin said he had decided to make a change after discovering that 50,000 people who had left M&S were able to claim the discount, which he said was hitting profits.","Marks & Spencer is increasing its stocks of smaller sizes in womenswear after a surge in demand left gaps on shelves.

The Guardian,https://www.theguardian.com/business/article/2024/jul/02/post-office-government-operators-horizon-it-scandal,2024-07-02,15:00:41 UTC,Post Office: next government urged to consider transferring ownership to operators,"Britain’s next government has been urged to set up a taskforce to explore the future for the state-owned Post Office including mutualisation – once victims of the Horizon IT scandal have been financially compensated.

The Post Office Horizon IT scandal has been described by MPs as one of the biggest miscarriages of justice in recent years and was highlighted by the recent ITV drama Mr Bates vs the Post Office.

The UK government faces the prospect of paying out multimillion-pound sums to compensate hundreds of post office operators who were wrongly prosecuted by the Post Office and lost money because the Horizon IT system wrongly showed financial shortfalls at their branches. A judge-led public inquiry is now trying to find out what went wrong.

However, there are growing questions about the longer-term future of the government-owned Post Office with its 11,500 branches across the UK which reported a £76m loss for the year ended March 2023, down from £130m in the previous year. It has 5,200 post offices in rural areas that provide vital services such as banking to communities where banks have closed their branches.

Nigel Railton, the Post Office chair, recently launched a strategic review looking at the sustainability of the business and its future. “As part of this work we’re seeking the views of serving postmasters and other stakeholders with an interest in Post Office’s role in communities across the country,” the Post Office said.

Earlier this year, Voice of the Postmaster, which represents about 900 operators, the Communication Workers Union (CWU), which represents Post Office employees, and Co-operatives UK met Kevin Hollinrake, the then Post Office minister, to talk about mutualisation which would lead to the ownership transferring from the state to staff.

Rose Marley, the chief executive of Co-operatives UK, the trade body for the UK’s 7,000 independent co-operative businesses, believes the next government should seriously explore the practicalities of mutual options for the Post Office – once victims have received financial compensation.

She said: “We understand that the Post Office network is complex, but if postmasters had enjoyed a genuine stake and a say in how the Post Office operates, it’s pretty clear we wouldn’t be in this mess.

“Evidence also shows that worker and employee-owned businesses are more productive, while community-based co-operatives are more resilient and sustainable as well, so it has to be looked at.”

Richard Trinder, the chair of Voice of the Postmaster, said a proposed taskforce could look at the critical challenges faced by Post Office and expand the scope of mutualisation to include not only post office operators and the communities they serve, but also examine issues such as long-term financial liabilities, IT legacy and a revised business model.

Trinder said: “There has to be a process for redressing victims of the scandal and we have to get the government to contribute and then leave the Post Office clear for a huge restructuring.”

Andy Furey, the assistant secretary of the CWU, said: “We support the concept of mutualisation as we have in the past. However, before any mutualisation can start then we need a new operating model and all key stakeholders need to play a significant part in running the company. The current management cannot remain in place and there needs to be significant investment.”

The National Federation of SubPostmasters (NFSP), which also represents Post Office operators, believes there should be an oversight committee which would work with the government: “While mutualisation is the ultimate goal of the NFSP, without the financial support of government, the Post Office simply would not survive and would result in thousands of postmasters losing their investment.

“What is more important is the governance of the Post Office, which is significantly responsible for the failures around the Horizon scandal. This is why the NFSP is proposing an oversight committee to work with the government as the shareholder, PO as the operator and postmasters as investors in the network. As the PO has a social purpose, this oversight committee should include consumer champions.”

In 2012, the then coalition government pledged to examine whether the Post Office could become a multi-stakeholder mutual that gave membership to post office operators and their customers, but no further action was taken.

Labour’s election manifesto has pledged to “explore ways to strengthen the Post Office network”, in consultation with post office operators, trade unions and customers, and support the development of new business models, such as banking hubs, that will help reinvigorate the high street.

The Liberal Democrats say they would encourage post offices to become community banking and government hubs. The Conservatives say in their manifesto that the Post Office should remain a “valuable social and economic asset” and delivering that goal “requires a change of culture at the top”. All the main parties have promised to ensure compensation for the victims of the scandal.

Rose Marley, the boss of Co-operatives UK, said: “The compensation is an absolute No 1 priority and rightly so and I think whatever political party gets in power … doing right by those postmasters is something the public want to see.”

The Guardian,https://www.theguardian.com/politics/article/2024/jul/02/sajid-javid-to-become-partner-at-investment-firm-centricus,2024-07-02,17:02:25 UTC,Sajid Javid to become partner at investment firm Centricus,"Sajid Javid, the former Conservative chancellor of the exchequer, is to become a partner at a London investment firm founded by a trio of his former colleagues at Deutsche Bank.

The former banker, who held seven ministerial positions in a 15-year political career, confirmed on Tuesday that he was joining Centricus, a private equity and asset manager based in Mayfair. He will start the role on 8 July.

Javid has already earned about £450,000 as a consultant for the company, which has $42bn (£33bn) of assets under management and invests in everything from football to luxury hotels and 3D printing.

The company began paying him £25,000 for up to 10 hours of work a month in March 2023, rising to £50,000 a month after he doubled his hours in April this year, according to the register of members’ interests.

He will join Centricus as a partner after the general election, in a full-time role that will reunite him with the company’s two other partners and co-founders, Nizar Al-Bassam and Dalinc Ariburnu.

Javid worked alongside both men at Deutsche Bank in the years leading up to – and during – the global banking crash, before he left to enter politics in 2009.

“The founders of the firm I know very well, because I used to work with them. Having left parliament and politics I was looking to go back into business and finance and Centricus is a firm I am very pleased to be joining,” said Javid.

“I will in my own time also be carving out time to support good causes. The motivations I had to get into politics to help others have never gone.”

Javid served in the cabinet under three prime ministers as the minister for business, health and culture, as well as home secretary. He resigned as chancellor in February 2020 after Boris Johnson asked him to sack his advisers, and was replaced by Rishi Sunak.

He rejoined Johnson’s cabinet in June 2021 as health secretary but sensationally quit in July 2022, amid a wave of resignations that ultimately brought down Johnson as prime minister.

Centricus says it focuses its investments in four areas, financial services, technology, infrastructure and media, consumer and entertainment.

The company is perhaps best known for its work advising the $100bn Vision Fund, a partnership between Japan’s SoftBank and the Saudi Arabian sovereign wealth fund.

Centricus, whose co-founder Al-Bassam holds British and Saudi citizenship according to Companies House filings, reportedly played a big role in securing investment from Riyadh.

The company’s third co-founder, Michele Faissola, reportedly left the firm after his connections with the Qatari government created tension with the Saudis, amid diplomatic tension between the two Gulf states.

Centricus also worked with European football’s governing body, Uefa, on an alternative proposal to a plan by several large football clubs to create a new Super League to rival the Champions League.

The company was also involved in an ill-fated attempt to buy Chelsea FC in 2022, during a forced sale process triggered by UK imposing sanctions on the club’s former owner, the Russian oligarch.

Javid’s consultancy work for Centricus has previously attracted the attention of the Advisory Committee on Business Appointment (Acoba), which examines the propriety of ministers taking jobs in the private sector after their service.

Acoba said Javid’s previous role as chancellor had afforded him “significant knowledge of fiscal and monetary policy”.

It said this knowledge might be “perceived to offer an unfair advantage to Centricus, specifically information regarding potential at-risk firms”.

However, the body cleared Javid to work for Centricus.

On Tuesday, Ariburnu, who donated £5,000 to Javid’s Bromsgrove constituency office in 2015, said the firm had “benefited greatly” from Javid’s advice over the past year.

“We are delighted that he has agreed to join our partnership and firm on a full-time basis,” said Aburnu.

“We look forward to further benefiting from his in-depth understanding and experience in global markets, international business and global geo-politics to help guide and execute our firm-wide strategy.”","Sajid Javid, the former Conservative chancellor of the exchequer, is to become a partner at a London investment firm founded by a trio of his former colleagues at Deutsche Bank.

The Guardian,https://www.theguardian.com/business/article/2024/jul/02/dale-vince-sues-guido-fawkes-owner-over-false-hamas-claims,2024-07-02,16:49:51 UTC,Dale Vince sues Guido Fawkes owner for libel over Hamas claims,"The Labour donor Dale Vince has employed a new legal approach to sue the political blog Guido Fawkes for libel, despite the website being hosted overseas.

Vince, who has given millions of pounds to Labour in the run-up to the general election, says the Westminster-focused blog falsely suggested that he supports Hamas, a proscribed terrorist group.

The green energy entrepreneur is now personally suing the site’s Ireland-based owner Paul Staines. The editor has previously declared that his Irish nationality and his blog being hosted in the US meant that “I don’t have to pay attention to what a British judge orders me to do”.

Vince said: “He believes his ‘offshore’ structure protects him from being accountable, that he can flout our laws and disregard basic principles … With this legal action we hope to change that.”

The green energy businessman has been given permission by an English judge to serve libel papers on Staines via email and post to his home in Ireland. Staines declined to comment.

Vince is also seeking a website blocking order, which means that a London-based court could order British internet service providers to block access to specific blogposts. The approach is more commonly used in copyright cases, such as the blocking of illegal Premier League football streams.

The case hinges on a Guido Fawkes post from March entitled “Multi-million pound donor to Labour party says Hamas are ‘freedom fighters’”. It consists of an edited clip from a Times Radio interview where Vince is asked: “Is a terrorist attack from Hamas Palestine defending itself?”

Vince replies: “I think one man’s terrorist is another man’s freedom fighter, right? That’s how it works.”

The businessman claims the clip was used to imply that he supported the terrorist acts of Hamas, including “the mass murder, kidnapping and rape which took place on 7 October”.

The Daily Mail and GB News have already apologised and paid damages to Vince over similar stories.

Vince said in a statement: “Some weeks ago, the Guido Fawkes website published false claims about me which spread quickly amongst rightwing channels and commentators, probably in part due to the imminent election. The intention was clear, to damage my credibility as a person and as a Labour supporter.

“We’ve secured numerous retractions with costs and damages already, such as from the Daily Mail and GB News, and for me this is the most important piece of the puzzle, the source. I’m pleased we’ve now been given permission to take action against the editor, Paul Staines.”

The Guido Fawkes site has previously said it asked Vince “to put on the record unambiguously that he does not think Hamas are freedom fighters”, in which case they “will be happy to withdraw and/or amend our previous reports accordingly”.

It added: “They stated he had previously condemned terrorism on the record. We accept and never claimed otherwise that Mr Vince has previously condemned terrorism, including saying of the specific acts of Hamas terrorism on the weekend of October 7, 2023: ‘I don’t support what they did.’ We remain baffled therefore why he won’t even through his lawyers confirm that he does not think Hamas are, in the words he used, ‘freedom fighters’.”

Guido Fawkes has links to the Tory party, having recently appointed the Conservative peer Ross Kempsell as a contributing editor. A former head of Boris Johnson’s Downing Street policy unit, he was given a peerage in Johnson’s resignation honours list.","The Labour donor Dale Vince has employed a new legal approach to sue the political blog Guido Fawkes for libel, despite the website being hosted overseas.

The Guardian,https://www.theguardian.com/politics/article/2024/jul/02/starmer-urges-minister-to-meet-royal-mail-over-postal-vote-delay-fears,2024-07-02,17:26:59 UTC,Starmer urges minister to meet Royal Mail over postal vote delay fears,"Keir Starmer has called on a government minister to meet the postal service over concerns that hundreds of people could miss out on casting their vote on polling day after their ballots failed to arrive.

The Labour leader said the Post Office minister, Kevin Hollinrake, should “get on with the job” of sorting out the problem that is believed to have hit Scotland, where the school holidays have already started, particularly badly.

Hollinrake was said to be “urgently” investigating a failure to get ballot packs to people in some constituencies in time for polling day. However, Royal Mail sources said on Tuesday that he had not yet raised his concerns.

Earlier, he had suggested Royal Mail should have anticipated extra demand for postal votes during the summer holidays amid fears that some could be left disfranchised because they are already overseas.

Royal Mail has hit back at criticism, insisting there was “no backlog” before the general election, as experts warned any delay could hit the Conservatives hardest.

However, Starmer told reporters on the campaign trail in Derbyshire: “I think [ministers] should actually get on with the job of sorting this out. It’s rather indicative, if it’s true, of the way the government has been run.

“If you’re in government, and they are in government, at least for the time being, they need to sort it out and get on with sorting it out. We can’t have these people who are entitled to a vote not being able to exercise it.

“So get on with the job, I’d say, and if the Post Office minister hasn’t met them, do it now in the next hour or two. Seriously, though, I mean, we’re running out of time. It’s not something you can do tomorrow.”

Scotland’s first minister, John Swinney, has pushed for a review of the timetable for general elections as a result of the issues with Scottish voters receiving postal ballots.

The election falls in the first full week of the school summer holidays in most parts of Scotland, with delays in receiving postal votes resulting in some Scots being left without a vote owing to already-planned holidays abroad.

In a letter to Rishi Sunak, Swinney said the issues had been caused by a combination of the prime minister’s decision to hold the vote on an “unsuitable date”, and the timetable for elections leaving “little room in it to address issues” which might arise.

A Royal Mail spokesperson said: “We have no backlog of postal service and, whilst we are not complacent, we remain confident that postal votes handed to us on time will be delivered prior to polling day.

“Where specific concerns have been raised, we have investigated and confirmed ballot packs are being delivered as soon as they arrive in our network.

“We would welcome a review into the timetable for future elections with all stakeholders to ensure that the system for printing and administering postal votes before they are handed to Royal Mail works as smoothly as possible.”

The Local Government Association has called for a review of the already “overburdened” system put under extra pressure by an “unprecedented increase” in people voting by post.

On Monday, the prime minister’s official spokesperson said he was not concerned that some people could be deprived of a vote as a result.","Keir Starmer has called on a government minister to meet the postal service over concerns that hundreds of people could miss out on casting their vote on polling day after their ballots failed to arrive.

The Guardian,https://www.theguardian.com/technology/article/2024/jul/02/tesla-second-quarter-sales,2024-07-02,14:30:35 UTC,Tesla sales fall for second straight quarter despite price cuts,"Tesla’s global sales fell for the second straight quarter despite price cuts and low-interest financing offers, another sign of weakening demand for the company’s products and electric vehicles overall.

The Austin, Texas, company said Tuesday that it sold 436,956 vehicles from April through June, down 4.8% from 466,140 sold the same period a year ago. The sales were better than the 436,000 figure that analysts had expected.

Demand for EVs worldwide is slowing, but they’re still growing for most automakers. Tesla, with an aging model lineup and relatively high average selling prices, has struggled more than other manufacturers.

Still it retained the title of the world’s top-selling electric vehicle maker. For the first half of the year, Tesla sold more than 910,000 vehicles worldwide, handily beating China’s BYD, which sold 726,153.

Tesla also sold over 33,000 more vehicles during the second quarter than it produced, which should reduce the company’s inventory on hand at its stores.

Tesla gave no explanation for the sales decline. The company will post second-quarter earnings on 23 July. The electric automaker’s sales decline comes as competition is increasing from legacy and startup automakers, which are trying to nibble away at the company’s market share. Most other automakers will report US sales figures later Tuesday.

Nearly all of Tesla’s sales came from the smaller and less-expensive Models 3 and Y, with the company selling only 21,551 of its more expensive models that include X and S, as well as the new Cybertruck.

The sales decline came despite Tesla knocking $2,000 off the prices of three of its five models in the US in April. The company cut the prices of the Model Y, Tesla’s most popular model and the top-selling electric vehicle in the US, and also of the Models X and S. Also during the quarter, Tesla knocked roughly a third off the price of its “Full Self Driving” system – which can’t drive itself and so drivers must remain alert and be ready to intervene.

Jessica Caldwell, head of insights for Edmunds.com, said Tesla is having trouble in a market where most early adopters already have EVs, and mainstream buyers are more skeptical that electric cars can meet their needs.

Tesla also has a set of unique problems, mainly a model lineup that doesn’t look much different than it did years ago, Caldwell said. With Tesla’s price cuts, used vehicle prices tumbled. Anyone wanting a Tesla can get a far better deal buying a used one, Caldwell said. “If you’re looking at monthly payments, it’s hard to compete against,” she said.

Caldwell doesn’t see any big catalyst this year that would boost Tesla sales unless gasoline prices spike. The new Cybertruck is being sold only in small numbers, and the rest of the lineup is old. “Most people would be hard pressed to figure out which one is the newer one and which one is the older one,” she said.

Wedbush analyst Dan Ives wrote in a note to investors on Tuesday that second-quarter sales were a “huge comeback performance” for Tesla. “In a nutshell, the worst is in the rearview mirror for Tesla,” he wrote. The company, he wrote, cut 10% to 15% of its workforce to reduce costs and preserve profitability. “It appears better days are now ahead as the growth story returns,” Ives wrote.

In its letter to investors in January, Tesla predicted “notably lower” sales growth this year. Tesla shares had been down more than 40% earlier in the year.","Tesla’s global sales fell for the second straight quarter despite price cuts and low-interest financing offers, another sign of weakening demand for the company’s products and electric vehicles overall.

The Guardian,https://www.theguardian.com/business/article/2024/jul/02/revolut-record-profits-ipo-uk-licence,2024-07-02,08:34:33 UTC,Revolut reports record profits as it hints at plans for IPO,"Revolut has reported record annual profits and further hinted at plans for a stock market flotation, despite still struggling to secure a UK banking licence.

The London-based fintech company, which has been waiting more than three years for its UK licence to be approved, swung to a £438m profit in 2023, having made a £25m loss a year earlier.

Profits were increased by higher interest rates and an ambitious expansion plan that helped to add 12 million customers to its user base last year. Revenues jumped 95% to £1.8bn in 2023, according to its latest annual report.

But bosses have yet to persuade regulators to grant the company a UK banking licence that would open the door to new income streams. A licence would allow Revolut to hold its customers’ deposits, which would help fund its own-branded loans and mortgages. It would also probably persuade regulators in other key countries such as the US to follow suit.

The challenge, in part, has been convincing regulators that Revolut has addressed a number of accounting and reputational concerns in recent years, after EU regulatory breaches, questions over its corporate culture and the late filing of its accounts.

Revolut bosses made little reference in its latest annual report to the UK application,which was lodged in early 2021, saying only: “We are continuing to work closely with the [Prudential Regulation Authority] on our UK bank licence application.”

However, Revolut – which was valued at $33bn in 2021 – gave further hints that it was on track for a bumper initial public offering (IPO). It said in its annual report that it had “enhanced” its financial controls in ways expected of “listed companies”.

It comes a year after the auditor BDO said it had been unable to get a full picture of Revolut’s revenue, and warned that as a result the company’s finances were at risk of being “materially misstated”.

Revolut said it had focused on improving its processes throughout 2023 in a way that allowed BDO to “increase their understanding of the business” and release its financial results earlier, having previously faced significant delays.

“We are pleased that Revolut’s transformation programme has now enabled us to return to a regular financial reporting schedule,” Revolut said. “We are confident we have set solid foundations that, in the long run, will support our expanding banking operations and will bring our financial processes in line with the standards expected from publicly listed companies.”

Revolut more than tripled the salary of its highest-paid director, believed to be the founder and chief executive Nik Storonsky, to £333,000 from £100,00 a year earlier. However, his overall pay plunged 97% due a big share payout in 2022 that took his total pay to £17.8m that year. That figure fell to £378,000 in 2023.","Revolut has reported record annual profits and further hinted at plans for a stock market flotation, despite still struggling to secure a UK banking licence.
Profits were increased by higher interest rates and an ambitious expansion plan that helped to add 12 million customers to its user base last year.
But bosses have yet to persuade regulators to grant the company a UK banking licence that would open the door to new income streams.
A licence would allow Revolut to hold its customers’ deposits, which would help fund its own-branded loans and mortgages.

The Guardian,https://www.theguardian.com/business/article/2024/jul/02/shell-to-pause-construction-of-huge-biodiesel-plant-in-rotterdam,2024-07-02,15:55:19 UTC,Shell to pause construction of huge biodiesel plant in Rotterdam,"Shell has paused the construction of one of Europe’s largest biofuel plants which was expected to convert waste into green jet fuel and biodiesel by the end of the decade.

The oil company said on Tuesday it would “temporarily pause” work on one of its biggest energy transition projects to address the technical difficulties that have delayed its progress so far.

Shell began constructing the plant, based in Rotterdam in the Netherlands, in 2021, and had initially expected to start producing up to 820,000 tonnes of biofuels a year in April, before this was pushed back to 2025.

About half of the plant’s biofuels were to be used for sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) made from waste cooking oil and animal fat. The fuel is seen by some as crucial if airlines are to cut their carbon emissions in line with global climate targets.

The nascent industry has also attracted criticism from those who claim that SAF is not a realistic replacement for paraffin-based aviation fuels within the timescale needed to prevent rising carbon emissions from creating a climate catastrophe.

“We’re taking the tough decision now to temporarily pause on-site construction,” a Shell spokesperson said. “This gives us the opportunity to take stock, complete engineering, optimise project sequencing and in doing so maintain capital discipline.”

The spokesperson added: “Low-carbon fuels form a key part of Shell’s ambitions to provide affordable and sustainable products to our customers.”

The aviation industry accounts for 3% of the world’s carbon emissions, and is seen as one of the most difficult forms of transportation to decarbonise.

The decision to pause the work deals another blow to Shell’s biofuels plans after the company cancelled an SAF project at Singapore’s Bukom Island in March last year.

Shell was considering investment in a plant that could produce 550,000 tonnes of SAF a year to supply major Asian hubs such as Hong Kong International airport and Singapore’s Changi.

The blow to Shell’s green aviation plans has come after the company signalled a scaling back of its green growth ambitions by reducing the number of staff working on low-carbon solutions by at least 200 roles, while a further 130 positions will be placed under review.

The decision is expected to affect Shell’s plans for offshore wind development and sharply scale back its ambitions to fuel hydrogen passenger vehicles. Shell was an early adopter of hydrogen, which has fallen out of favour as electric vehicles become more popular.

Instead, Shell’s chief executive, Wael Sawan, is planning to shift its focus towards high-profit oil projects and expanding its gas business to exploit higher global oil and gas prices after Russia’s invasion of Ukraine.

The rise in global energy market prices has prompted executives across the oil and gas industry to review green investment plans and climate targets.

BP confirmed last week it would halt investment in new offshore wind projects, and place a hiring freeze for the new business division, in an apparent attempt to placate investors who are unhappy with the greener direction set by its ousted boss Bernard Looney.","Shell has paused the construction of one of Europe’s largest biofuel plants which was expected to convert waste into green jet fuel and biodiesel by the end of the decade.

The Guardian,https://www.theguardian.com/business/nils-pratley-on-finance/article/2024/jul/02/ms-gets-it-right-finally-on-annual-meetings-others-should-make-an-effort,2024-07-02,14:54:45 UTC,M&S gets it right (finally) on annual meetings. Others should make an effort | Nils Pratley,"Archie Norman’s first attempt, a year ago, to reinvent the annual shareholder meeting for the digital age suffered from an enormous error. In designing the event as digital-only – in other words, in telling shareholders not to turn up in person and to tune in online instead – the chair of Marks & Spencer abused the well-established principle that even small investors in a listed company must have the right, once a year, to buttonhole the bosses in the flesh. Directors cannot expect to live virtually; the pandemic is over.

His second effort on Tuesday was vastly improved because it was a genuine hybrid event. Shareholders were free to ignore M&S’s odd advice that they would get “the best experience” by joining online, and 100-plus individuals were in the room at the company’s headquarters in Paddington, west London. The point, let’s hope, has been made: leave it up to the punters to decide how they wish to participate, which is how M&S behaves in its day job as an “omnichannel” retailer.

Yet Norman’s push for greater digital access is correct at its core. To catch the attention of private shareholders – folk who everybody says are vital to the task of reviving interest in public markets – there must be a video component in the age of Zoom and Teams. Not everybody lives in London, where most meetings happen. M&S’s online audience was many times greater than the one in the building.

One cannot say the investors were treated to scintillating content, of course. The main mini-revelation in the Q&A was that the company had an astonishing 50,000 ex-employees with discount cards entitling them to 20%-off for life before the chief executive, Stuart Machin, decided the policy was absurdly generous and moved the qualifying employment period from 10 years to 25.

But shareholders did get to press Norman on his cautious approach to dividends, which seemed to be their main grumble. And he and Machin were obliged to explain why M&S won’t guarantee to pay its contractors, as opposed to its staff, the real living wage. That is worth doing in a public forum.

Broadly speaking, the hybrid format worked. It is possible to quibble with the use of a “shareholder advocate”, in the form of broadcaster Anita Anand, to select the online questions, but a managed process does allow more ground to be covered. And an outsider is arguably better placed than the chair to cut off verbose questioners or the offensive variety (recall the appalling misogynistic comments at Aviva’s meeting a couple of years ago).

Other companies should take note. Attendances at annual company meetings have been in decline for years. Most boardrooms give the impression they wish the events didn’t exist, whether out of fear of protesters or because they regard small investors as irrelevant. Norman is at least trying to stir interest and “stand up for the small shareholder”, which should be applauded.

A few big-name investment trusts, such as Fundsmith and Scottish Mortgage, attract healthy audiences of interested investors who ask sharp questions.

The Guardian,https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/article/2024/jul/02/labour-plans-britain-private-finance-blackrock,2024-07-02,15:30:41 UTC,Labour is putting its plans for Britain in the hands of private finance. It could end badly | Daniela Gabor,"The Labour party has a plan for returning to power: it will get BlackRock to rebuild Britain. Its reasoning is straightforward. A cash-strapped government that wants to avoid tax increases or austerity has no choice but to partner with big finance, attracting private investment to rebuild the infrastructure that is crumbling after years of Tory underinvestment. Labour has already done the arithmetic: to mobilise £3 of private capital from institutional investors, you need to offer them £1 in public subsidies. But every time you hear Labour announce such an infrastructure partnership, think of the hidden politics. BlackRock will privatise Britain – our housing, education, health, nature and green energy – with our taxpayer money as sweetener.

BlackRock has long peddled the idea of public-private partnerships for infrastructure, climate and development. Yet its political momentum has recently accelerated. When its chair, Larry Fink, the world’s most powerful financier, sat with world leaders at the G7 summit last month, he promised the following: rich countries need growth, infrastructure investment can deliver that growth, but public debt is too high for the state alone to invest the estimated $75tn (£59tn) necessary by 2040. Trillions, however, are available to asset managers who look after our pensions and insurance contributions (BlackRock, the largest of these firms, manages about $10tn, as a shrinking welfare state pushes us – future pensioners – into its arms).

If governments work with big finance, Fink explained, they can unlock these trillions. But to do so, they will need to mint public infrastructure into investable assets that can generate steady returns for investors. Why does BlackRock need the state? Why can’t it deploy trillions without the government’s helping hand? The British public remembers all too well PFIs, the private finance initiatives through which the state ended up paying extortionate amounts to private contractors that designed, built, financed or operated public services such as prisons, schools and hospitals before handing them back to the state, often in poor condition.

But for big finance, there is more now at stake. In this golden age of infrastructure, financiers plan to own our infrastructure outright and transform it into a source of steady revenue. Since buying Global Infrastructure Partners in January 2024, BlackRock holds about $150bn in infrastructure assets, including US renewable energy companies, wastewater services in France and airports in England and Australia. It plans to expand aggressively, just like other private infrastructure funds. Direct ownership is the main game, but not the only one. Big finance can also invest in infrastructure indirectly, by lending to private infrastructure companies. The key is returns. For this, BlackRock wants the state to “derisk” investments. This financial jargon was included in the 2024 Labour manifesto, and it in essence involves the state stepping in to improve the returns on infrastructure assets.

The choice here is not merely between public and private financing of public goods, but whether British citizens should tolerate the government handing out public subsidies for privatised infrastructure. Housing is only one example of the areas where these investors can already be glimpsed. Institutional landlords – the most prominent being Blackstone, the private equity fund – can acquire residential housing by participating in the privatisation of public housing. After the global financial crisis, the firm also bought up nonperforming mortgages, and since then it has gone on a global shopping spree, snapping up homes across the US and Europe. In the past year, Blackstone bought new rental homes in Britain worth about £1.4bn from the housebuilding company Vistry.

Look behind Blackstone’s returns – which come from rents and rising house prices – and you will find the state’s footprint. The government has helped to guarantee and derisk these returns through regulations that favour asset owners over renters, through economic policies that support house price inflation and through the provision of income support – such as housing benefit – that allows renters to continue paying their institutional landlords. Although we’re told that partnering with these investors is a means of solving the housing crisis, it often delivers the opposite: higher rents, the displacement of lower-income tenants who are often from minority groups, and less affordable housing. This explains the backlash against institutional landlords, from Copenhagen to Berlin, Dublin and Madrid. Yet such public pressure will only be effective once the state returns to building public housing.

Labour’s strategy raises a bigger set of questions about the type of state we want. Starmer’s vision for government-by-BlackRock reduces the question of state capacity to “how do I get BlackRock to invest in infrastructure assets?” This model involves the state in effect subsidising the privatisation of everyday life. This doesn’t only make it harder to bring public goods back into public ownership; it also allows big finance to tighten the grip on the social contract with citizens, and to become the ultimate arbiter of climate, energy and welfare politics, which will have profound distributional, structural and political consequences.

Already, BlackRock is betting on becoming a key provider of green energy infrastructure – though its actual commitment to tackling the climate crisis only extends so far. The firm has lobbied heavily against European proposals to regulate its lending to fossil fuel interests with penalties, and has instead called for voluntary climate commitments. It is aiming to rapidly grow its green energy profits by tapping the government subsidies that will probably be provided through Starmer’s GB Energy, and through the US Inflation Reduction Act.

But the profits BlackRock will hope to generate through investing in green energy are likely to come at a huge cost. In Britain, we know that the public ownership of green energy is more effective at lowering consumer bills, accelerating the green transition and creating good jobs. The risk is not only that our climate future will be vastly more expensive if actors such as BlackRock are driving it, but that this future will also produce a more unequal society, where citizens equate green measures with unaffordable public services. This may well provide the kindling for authoritarian, far-right fossil-fuel politics that reject the green transition and frame it as an assault on people’s living standards.

Instead, we should plan creatively for a future where extreme climate events necessitate permanent state intervention, from price controls to buffer stocks and public ownership. What’s needed is a big green state. For this, we first need to repair a serious failure of macroeconomic policy imagination that regards the public purse as too small to fund transformative public infrastructure. To do so will require a radical transformation of the state. The state that Rachel Reeves, the likely future chancellor, promises us must break down the neoliberal walls between monetary, fiscal and industrial policy, and scrap low-tax regimes for multinational corporations and individuals with high net worths. It must shrink the power of big finance. This would be a gigantic undertaking, but it is the only realistic one we have.

If governments work with big finance, Fink explained, they can unlock these trillions. But to do so, they will need to mint public infrastructure into investable assets that can generate steady returns for investors. Why does BlackRock need the state? Why can’t it deploy trillions without the government’s helping hand? The British public remembers all too well PFIs, the private finance initiatives through which the state ended up paying extortionate amounts to private contractors that designed, built, financed or operated public services such as prisons, schools and hospitals before handing them back to the state, often in poor condition.

But for big finance, there is more now at stake. In this golden age of infrastructure, financiers plan to own our infrastructure outright and transform it into a source of steady revenue. Since buying Global Infrastructure Partners in January 2024, BlackRock holds about $150bn in infrastructure assets, including US renewable energy companies, wastewater services in France and airports in England and Australia. It plans to expand aggressively, just like other private infrastructure funds. Direct ownership is the main game, but not the only one. Big finance can also invest in infrastructure indirectly, by lending to private infrastructure companies. The key is returns. For this, BlackRock wants the state to “derisk” investments. This financial jargon was included in the 2024 Labour manifesto, and it in essence involves the state stepping in to improve the returns on infrastructure assets.

The choice here is not merely between public and private financing of public goods, but whether British citizens should tolerate the government handing out public subsidies for privatised infrastructure. Housing is only one example of the areas where these investors can already be glimpsed. Institutional landlords – the most prominent being Blackstone, the private equity fund – can acquire residential housing by participating in the privatisation of public housing. After the global financial crisis, the firm also bought up nonperforming mortgages, and since then it has gone on a global shopping spree, snapping up homes across the US and Europe. In the past year, Blackstone bought new rental homes in Britain worth about £1.4bn from the housebuilding company Vistry.

Look behind Blackstone’s returns – which come from rents and rising house prices – and you will find the state’s footprint. The government has helped to guarantee and derisk these returns through regulations that favour asset owners over renters, through economic policies that support house price inflation and through the provision of income support – such as housing benefit – that allows renters to continue paying their institutional landlords. Although we’re told that partnering with these investors is a means of solving the housing crisis, it often delivers the opposite: higher rents, the displacement of lower-income tenants who are often from minority groups, and less affordable housing. This explains the backlash against institutional landlords, from Copenhagen to Berlin, Dublin and Madrid. Yet such public pressure will only be effective once the state returns to building public housing.

Labour’s strategy raises a bigger set of questions about the type of state we want. Starmer’s vision for government-by-BlackRock reduces the question of state capacity to “how do I get BlackRock to invest in infrastructure assets?” This model involves the state in effect subsidising the privatisation of everyday life. This doesn’t only make it harder to bring public goods back into public ownership; it also allows big finance to tighten the grip on the social contract with citizens, and to become the ultimate arbiter of climate, energy and welfare politics, which will have profound distributional, structural and political consequences.

Already, BlackRock is betting on becoming a key provider of green energy infrastructure – though its actual commitment to tackling the climate crisis only extends so far. The firm has lobbied heavily against European proposals to regulate its lending to fossil fuel interests with penalties, and has instead called for voluntary climate commitments. It is aiming to rapidly grow its green energy profits by tapping the government subsidies that will probably be provided through Starmer’s GB Energy, and through the US Inflation Reduction Act.

But the profits BlackRock will hope to generate through investing in green energy are likely to come at a huge cost. In Britain, we know that the public ownership of green energy is more effective at lowering consumer bills, accelerating the green transition and creating good jobs. The risk is not only that our climate future will be vastly more expensive if actors such as BlackRock are driving it, but that this future will also produce a more unequal society, where citizens equate green measures with unaffordable public services. This may well provide the kindling for authoritarian, far-right fossil-fuel politics that reject the green transition and frame it as an assault on people’s living standards.

Instead, we should plan creatively for a future where extreme climate events necessitate permanent state intervention, from price controls to buffer stocks and public ownership. What’s needed is a big green state. For this, we first need to repair a serious failure of macroeconomic policy imagination that regards the public purse as too small to fund transformative public infrastructure. To do so will require a radical transformation of the state. The state that Rachel Reeves, the likely future chancellor, promises us must break down the neoliberal walls between monetary, fiscal and industrial policy, and scrap low-tax regimes for multinational corporations and individuals with high net worths. It must shrink the power of big finance. This would be a gigantic undertaking, but it is the only realistic one we have.

The Guardian,https://www.theguardian.com/technology/article/2024/jul/02/can-ai-boom-drive-nvidia-to-a-4tn-valuation-despite-investor-doubt,2024-07-02,05:00:35 UTC,Can AI boom drive Nvidia to a $4tn valuation despite investor doubt?,"When Jensen Huang spoke at the Nvidia annual general meeting last week, he made no mention of a share price slide.

The US chipmaker, buoyed up by its key role in the artificial intelligence boom, had briefly become the world’s most valuable company on 18 June but the crown slipped quickly. Nvidia shed about $550bn (£434bn) from the $3.4tn (£2.68tn) peak market value it had reached that week, as tech investors, combining profit-taking with doubts about the sustainability of its rocketing growth, applied the brakes.

Huang, however, spoke like the CEO of a business that took 30 days this year to go from a valuation of $2tn to $3tn – and sees $4tn coming into view.

He described a forthcoming group of powerful new chips, called Blackwell, as potentially “the most successful product in our history” and perhaps in the entire history of the computer. He added that the new wave for AI would be automating $50tn of heavy industry, and described what sounded like an endless loop of robotic factories orchestrating robots that “build products that are robotic”.

Wrapping up, he said: “We’ve reinvented Nvidia, the computer industry and very likely the world.”

These are the kinds of words on which a $4tn valuation, and the AI hype cycle, are built. Nvidia shares are inching back, returning above $3tn this week, because it remains the best way to buy shares in the AI boom. Is that enough to propel it to $4tn despite the emergence of investor doubt?

Alvin Nguyen, a senior analyst at the research company Forrester, said “only a collapse of the genAI market” would prevent Nvidia from reaching $4tn at some point – but whether it got there first ahead of tech rivals was another matter. Currently, Microsoft – another big player in AI – and Apple are first and second respectively in terms of market size, with Nvidia third.

If OpenAI’s next big AI model, GPT-5, and other new models were astonishing, the share price would stay buoyant and could get to $4tn by the end of 2025, said Nguyen. But if they underwhelmed, then the share price could be affected, given its status as a flag-carrier for the technology. A technological breakthrough could result in less computing power being needed to train models, he added, or interest from businesses and consumers in generative AI tools could be less robust than hoped.

“There is a lot that is unknown and out of Nvidia’s control that could impact their path to $4tn,” said Nguyen. “Such as disappointment with new models that come out, model improvements that reduce the computational needs, and weaker than expected demand from enterprises and consumers for genAI products.”

Private AI research labs such as OpenAI and Anthropic – the entities behind the ChatGPT and Claude chatbots – aren’t traded on public markets, leaving vast sums of money floating around in investor accounts with no way to access some of the big hitters in the generative AI frenzy.

Buying shares in multinationals such as Microsoft or Google is already expensive, and only a fraction of an investment is related to the hot new thing. There could be a vast AI boom but if, for example, Google’s search ads business faltered as a result, then the company wouldn’t necessarily be a net winner.

Nvidia, by contrast, is selling spades in a gold rush. Despite years of investment in capacity, it continues to sell its top-end chips faster than it can make them. Huge proportions of the investments in frontier AI research flow straight out of the labs and into Nvidia’s coffers, with companies such as Meta committing billions of dollars of spend to secure hundreds of thousands of Nvidia’s GPUs (graphics processing units).

That type of chip, the company’s specialty, was once sold to enable gamers to experience crisp and smooth graphics in 3D games – and through a monumental stroke of good luck, turned out to be exactly what cutting-edge researchers needed to build massive AI systems such as GPT-4 or Claude 3.5.

GPUs are able to carry out, at great volume and speed, the complicated calculations that underpin the training and operation of AI tools such as chatbots. So any company wanting to build or operate a generative AI product, such as ChatGPT or Google’s Gemini, needs GPUs. The same goes for deployment of freely available AI models such as Meta’s Llama, which also requires vast amounts of chips as part of its training phase. In the case of systems known as large language models (LLMs), training involves crunching through huge blocks of data. This teaches the LLM to recognise patterns in language and gauge what should be the next word or sentence in response to a chatbot query.

Nvidia has never quite cornered the AI chip market, though. Google has always relied on its own chips, which it calls TPUs (for “tensor”, a feature of an AI model), and others want to join it. Meta has developed its Meta Training and Inference Accelerator, Amazon offers its Trainium2 chips to companies using AWS (Amazon Web Services), and Intel has produced the Gaudi 3.

None of the big rivals compete with Nvidia – yet – at the absolute top end. But that’s not the only place where competition is happening. A report from the Information, a tech news site, highlighted the rise of “batch processing”, offering businesses cheaper access to AI models if they’re OK with waiting for their queries to be run at periods of low demand. That, in turn, allows providers such as OpenAI to buy cheaper, more efficient chips for their datacentres rather than focus all their spending on the fastest possible hardware.

At the other end, smaller businesses are starting to offer increasingly specialised products that beat what Nvidia can provide in a head-to-head race. Groq (not to be confused with Elon Musk’s similarly named Grok AI, the launch of which sparked an ongoing trademark dispute) makes chips which can’t be used to train AI at all – but which run the resulting models blazingly fast. Not to be outdone, the startup Etched, which has just raised $120m, is building a chip that only runs one type of AI model: a “transformer”, the T in GPT (generative pre-trained transformer).

Nvidia doesn’t just need to hold its own in the face of competition, big and small. To hit the next milestone, it needs to thrive. Market fundamentals are out of fashion, but if the company were valued like a traditional, low-growth enterprise, even a $3tn market cap would require it to sell a trillion of its top-end GPUs a year, at a 30% profit margin, forever, one expert noted.

Even if the AI industry grows enough to justify that, Nvidia’s own profit margin may be harder to defend. The company has the chip designs to hold the lead, but the real bottlenecks in its supply chain are the same as for much of the rest of the industry: at the advanced semiconductor foundries, of the sort operated by Taiwan’s TSMC, America’s Intel, China’s SMIC and precious few others around the world. Notably not on that list is Nvidia itself, which is a customer of TSMC. No matter how advanced Nvidia’s chipsets are, if it needs to eat into the rest of TSMC’s order book to match demand, then the profit will inevitably flow that way too.

Neil Wilson, the chief analyst at the brokerage firm Finalto, said the bear case against Nvidia – market jargon for a sustained fall in share price – rested on the argument that once the company worked through its order book, it would go back to less frenetic levels of demand.

“All their customers have been rushing to order the GPUs but they won’t be doing that forever,” said Wilson. “Customers over-order and then start cancelling. It’s a sweet spot now but it cannot be sustained.” He could see Nvidia getting to $4tn and beyond, but “maybe not at the current pace”.

Jim Reid, Deutsche Bank’s head of global economics and thematic research, published a note this week asking if Nvidia was “the fastest growing large company of all time?” Pointing out that Nvidia went from $2tn to $3tn in 30 days, Reid said conversely, it had taken Warren Buffett 60 years to get Berkshire Hathaway close to $1tn.

Nonetheless, in a world of low productivity – a measure of economic efficiency – and declining working age populations and rising government debts, the economic promise of AI was welcome, said Reid.

“If AI is the catalyst for a fourth Industrial Revolution, that would be very good news,” he wrote. “If not then markets will ultimately have a big problem.”

More is at stake than winning a race to $4tn.","Nvidia shares are inching back, returning above $3tn this week, because it remains the best way to buy shares in the AI boom.

The Guardian,https://www.theguardian.com/business/article/2024/jun/30/better-economic-news-will-not-stop-tories-from-suffering-their-biggest-ever-defeat,2024-06-30,10:14:41 UTC,Better economic news will not stop Tories from suffering their biggest ever defeat | Larry Elliott,"Down the years the Conservative party has taken some heavy election beatings but the one in prospect this week could be of a different order of magnitude.

Assuming the polls are right – and they have been consistent since the start of the campaign – the Tories will do worse even than in 1906, their previous nadir. Back then, the Conservatives and their Liberal Unionist allies won just 156 seats, a repeat of which on Thursday would now be considered a good result.

But in 1906, Arthur Balfour’s outgoing government secured more than 43% of the vote, while Rishi Sunak is polling at about half that level. And Balfour’s defeat could at least be attributed to a policy issue – free trade versus protectionism. Today, voters just seem sick of the Tories.

News on the economy since the election was called has had little or no impact on the polls. In part, that’s because the signals have been mixed: inflation fell back to its 2% target and growth in the first quarter of 2024 has been revised up, but the economy stagnated in April and unemployment has increased.

Living standards are certainly improving. The Resolution Foundation thinktank calculates that real per capita household disposable income – a guide to whether people are getting better off after inflation is taken into account – rose by 2.4% over the past year.

That’s the good news. The bad news is that over the 2019-24 parliament as a whole, living standards fell by 0.6% and one of the unwritten rules of political economy is that governments don’t remain popular when voters are getting poorer.

Only twice in the past century have living standards been lower at the end of a parliament than when it commenced: in 1918-22, when the UK suffered from a post-first world war boom-bust, and in the short parliament of 1950-51, when inflation rose sharply as a result of the rearmament programme for the Korean war.

In the inevitable postmortem examination that will follow the election, attention will focus on whether the Tories might have done better had Sunak delayed the election so that in time more voters would have come to think an economic corner genuinely had been turned. Another quarter or two of rising living standards would not have saved the Conservatives from defeat but it would probably have limited the scale of it.

As it is, Rachel Reeves will be the beneficiary. Analysts have been revising up their growth estimates for 2024 and 2025 on the basis that consumers will start to run down the precautionary savings they accumulated during the cost of living crisis.

Other recent developments – especially those overseas – are not so welcome. Joe Biden’s poor performance in his head to head debate with Donald Trump has made it more likely that the latter will win the US presidential election. Tariffs will be raised and taxes will be cut if that happens, threatening higher inflation and rising debt.

Meanwhile, the first round of voting in France’s parliamentary election looks set to show sizeable gains for Marine Le Pen’s rightwing National Rally party and a defeat for Emmanuel Macron’s centrist government.

Events in both the US and France highlight how things have changed in the near decade and a half since Labour was last in power.

Most obviously, the world has become a less safe place. The war between Ukraine and Russia is now well into its third year and has shattered the notion that permanent peace can be guaranteed for western developed nations. There are always demands for Labour governments to spend more on the NHS and on the welfare state. This time there will also be pressure to raise defence spending.

Globalisation has gone into retreat. Weak growth since the financial crisis of 2008-09 has seen a marked increase in protectionist measures – not just on goods but on people too. In Europe, North America and Australasia alike there have been demands for governments to restrict the number of foreign nationals entering the country.

What’s more, multilateral bodies are for the most part weaker than they were in 2010. The increasingly fractious relationship between the US and China means the G20 group of leading developed and developing nations cannot agree on much. The World Trade Organization is a much-diminished institution, unable to fulfil either of its core functions: to negotiate multilateral trade deals and be the final arbiter in trade disputes. The EU is having to contend with rising nationalist sentiment, a function of feeble economic performance and a reaction against rule by unelected technocrats.

The developing world has been even harder hit by Covid and the cost of living crisis than the rich west, increasing the incentive for migrants to look for a better life elsewhere. Yet aid budgets have been cut and promises to help poor countries cope with the impact of climate change have not been fulfilled. The world is getting hotter and the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank urgently need more money to meet demands for their assistance.

So those are the sort of challenges that Labour will face when it takes office later this week. Not the world of 1997, when Russia was seen as an ally rather than a strategic threat. Not the middle of the Great Moderation – the period between the fall of communism and the global financial crisis – when the west enjoyed year after year of growth and low inflation, but rather a world still trying to claw its way out of the Great Stagnation of the past 15 years.

And an angrier world where voters can quickly turn on their governments. Labour should enjoy its honeymoon period. It might not last long.","And Balfour’s defeat could at least be attributed to a policy issue – free trade versus protectionism.

The Guardian,https://www.theguardian.com/business/article/2024/jun/30/better-economic-news-will-not-stop-tories-from-suffering-their-biggest-ever-defeat,2024-06-30,10:14:41 UTC,Better economic news will not stop Tories from suffering their biggest ever defeat | Larry Elliott,"Down the years the Conservative party has taken some heavy election beatings but the one in prospect this week could be of a different order of magnitude.

Assuming the polls are right – and they have been consistent since the start of the campaign – the Tories will do worse even than in 1906, their previous nadir. Back then, the Conservatives and their Liberal Unionist allies won just 156 seats, a repeat of which on Thursday would now be considered a good result.

But in 1906, Arthur Balfour’s outgoing government secured more than 43% of the vote, while Rishi Sunak is polling at about half that level. And Balfour’s defeat could at least be attributed to a policy issue – free trade versus protectionism. Today, voters just seem sick of the Tories.

News on the economy since the election was called has had little or no impact on the polls. In part, that’s because the signals have been mixed: inflation fell back to its 2% target and growth in the first quarter of 2024 has been revised up, but the economy stagnated in April and unemployment has increased.

Living standards are certainly improving. The Resolution Foundation thinktank calculates that real per capita household disposable income – a guide to whether people are getting better off after inflation is taken into account – rose by 2.4% over the past year.

That’s the good news. The bad news is that over the 2019-24 parliament as a whole, living standards fell by 0.6% and one of the unwritten rules of political economy is that governments don’t remain popular when voters are getting poorer.

Only twice in the past century have living standards been lower at the end of a parliament than when it commenced: in 1918-22, when the UK suffered from a post-first world war boom-bust, and in the short parliament of 1950-51, when inflation rose sharply as a result of the rearmament programme for the Korean war.

In the inevitable postmortem examination that will follow the election, attention will focus on whether the Tories might have done better had Sunak delayed the election so that in time more voters would have come to think an economic corner genuinely had been turned. Another quarter or two of rising living standards would not have saved the Conservatives from defeat but it would probably have limited the scale of it.

As it is, Rachel Reeves will be the beneficiary. Analysts have been revising up their growth estimates for 2024 and 2025 on the basis that consumers will start to run down the precautionary savings they accumulated during the cost of living crisis.

Other recent developments – especially those overseas – are not so welcome. Joe Biden’s poor performance in his head to head debate with Donald Trump has made it more likely that the latter will win the US presidential election. Tariffs will be raised and taxes will be cut if that happens, threatening higher inflation and rising debt.

Meanwhile, the first round of voting in France’s parliamentary election looks set to show sizeable gains for Marine Le Pen’s rightwing National Rally party and a defeat for Emmanuel Macron’s centrist government.

Events in both the US and France highlight how things have changed in the near decade and a half since Labour was last in power.

Most obviously, the world has become a less safe place. The war between Ukraine and Russia is now well into its third year and has shattered the notion that permanent peace can be guaranteed for western developed nations. There are always demands for Labour governments to spend more on the NHS and on the welfare state. This time there will also be pressure to raise defence spending.

Globalisation has gone into retreat. Weak growth since the financial crisis of 2008-09 has seen a marked increase in protectionist measures – not just on goods but on people too. In Europe, North America and Australasia alike there have been demands for governments to restrict the number of foreign nationals entering the country.

What’s more, multilateral bodies are for the most part weaker than they were in 2010. The increasingly fractious relationship between the US and China means the G20 group of leading developed and developing nations cannot agree on much. The World Trade Organization is a much-diminished institution, unable to fulfil either of its core functions: to negotiate multilateral trade deals and be the final arbiter in trade disputes. The EU is having to contend with rising nationalist sentiment, a function of feeble economic performance and a reaction against rule by unelected technocrats.

The developing world has been even harder hit by Covid and the cost of living crisis than the rich west, increasing the incentive for migrants to look for a better life elsewhere. Yet aid budgets have been cut and promises to help poor countries cope with the impact of climate change have not been fulfilled. The world is getting hotter and the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank urgently need more money to meet demands for their assistance.

So those are the sort of challenges that Labour will face when it takes office later this week. Not the world of 1997, when Russia was seen as an ally rather than a strategic threat. Not the middle of the Great Moderation – the period between the fall of communism and the global financial crisis – when the west enjoyed year after year of growth and low inflation, but rather a world still trying to claw its way out of the Great Stagnation of the past 15 years.

And an angrier world where voters can quickly turn on their governments. Labour should enjoy its honeymoon period. It might not last long.","And Balfour’s defeat could at least be attributed to a policy issue – free trade versus protectionism.

The Guardian,https://www.theguardian.com/global/article/2024/jul/02/techscape-new-uk-government-data-nhs,2024-07-02,10:30:35 UTC,TechScape: Here’s four ways a new Labour government could use tech to boost Britain,"Barring an asteroid strike, Keir Starmer is going to be the UK prime minister in three days. Given the lead in polling, I’d probably bet on him over an asteroid, too.

Labour will come into government with a broken state, a flatlining economy and no money. A thin manifesto and enormous parliamentary majority means the party will almost certainly end up stretching further afield for ideas about how to deal with that trilemma from hell.

So let’s try and offer some.

Free our data

In March 2006, back when the Guardian technology section was a physical supplement in Thursday’s newspaper, we ran a campaign to “free our data”. We wrote about government-owned and approved agencies such as the Ordnance Survey, the UK Hydrographic Office and the Highways Agency collecting data on our behalf. We asked: “Why can’t we get at that data as easily as we can Google Maps?”

The campaign was, over the years that followed, a mixed success. Across the public sector, a new norm was created that government data should generally be made available to the public when possible. It almost certainly influenced the direction of the gov.uk project, putting open data at the heart of the state’s digital footprint, and a glance at the top-level data.gov.uk website shows how much work has been done to that end.

Someone born on the day of that campaign’s launch will be voting for the first time on Thursday. Yet some of the most valuable pieces of our digital infrastructure are still locked up, behind restrictive terms or expensive paywalls.

The Postcode Address File is one example. It holds 1.8m postcodes and almost 30m postal addresses, and is the ground truth for how we navigate the country. It was privatised along with Royal Mail, but remains tightly controlled by the state, with access charges regulated by Ofcom and a unique license for the public sector to use it at a flat cost.

Freeing our data is the right thing to do, but successive governments have viewed it as expensive: giving up a valuable revenue stream, in the name of abstract concepts. But a Labour party looking for growth and state renewal over the next few years should recognise that if a government dataset is valuable enough to be worth charging for, it’s even more valuable if it can be built on, improved and reused.

Similarly, much of the data that has been freed in the last two decades has been released under non-commercial licenses. The public is naturally squeamish about changes that could be seen to be “selling our data”, but offering state data for free to hobbyists and charging a license for commercial use is the worst of both worlds: the data is still sold, but the only businesses able to extract a commercial advantage from it are those already big enough to pay the fees.

There is more behind such a change than just the nebulous promise of economic growth; there’s also the simple fact that the government’s data is very good, and eliminating daily annoyances from people’s lives helps. I speak from experience: my flat was built in 2020, and for the first year I lived in it, I was functionally invisible to most e-commerce. Those who had paid through the nose to license the PAF could deliver to me; everyone else had to call and beg for directions, while they waited for changes to propagate through various inferior free databases that provide the same information.

Like Nixon going to China, a Labour government at the height of its popularity may be the only one that could sell such a change to the British people. Free our data, boost growth, and strip friction from our daily lives.

… Even the medical stuff

This is worth breaking out, because it’s far more controversial than simply offering access to Ordnance Survey maps. NHS England is one of the largest unitary health providers in the world. Its pursuit of clinical excellence is globally respected, even after 14 years of misrule; and its alliance with researchers across the country is foundational.

Pharmacology is on the cusp of a revolution. Vaccine development was pushed a decade ahead by the race to protect against Covid, and mRNA vaccines that can beat the next pandemic before it’s started are the next frontier. Gene therapy has gone from science fiction to dangerous experiment to fact of life, with rare genetic conditions now able to be cured, permanently, with a single course of personalised medicine. The cost of genetic sequencing continues to drop, allowing those same conditions to be diagnosed at birth rather than years later when the symptoms are damaging and permanent.

The NHS should be at the forefront of such research. For many types of genetic disorder, involving just a single base-pair mutation, a cure already exists in theory, but the practical realities of creating, testing and certifying it is beyond the ken of private industry.

Yet a disease that affects one in a million children pops up in the UK once every 18 months. With free genetic testing offered at birth, and a state capable of taking the long-term view of costs, a treatment could be offered to every single one of them.

It’s not only the right thing to do; it also helps the country at large. A £1m, or even £10m, project to treat a genetic condition in a single child is nothing compared to the cost of supporting someone to live their life with a profound disability.

And a cure doesn’t have to stay in the UK. A very different type of medical success, semaglutide, has been so successful it has reshaped the Danish economy. The drug, sold under names such as Ozempic and Wegovy, was developed by Novo Nordisk. In 2022 two-thirds of the country’s economic growth was due to the pharmaceutical industry, essentially down to its phenomenal popularity.

Get tough on Big Tech

The groundwork has already been laid for the Digital Markets Unit, the arm of the Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) tasked with enforcing the digital markets, competition and consumers bill, a wide-ranging piece of legislation that serves as Britain’s equivalent of the EU’s Digital Markets Act. But the next secretary of state still has leeway to judge exactly how it gets enforced.

One of the first things on Labour’s plate will be sending the formal instructions to the CMA kickstarting that process. Doing it as a priority in the summer would be valuable, because the European experience shows that much of the response to competition enforcement consists of delaying actions; equally as important are the quirks of wording in those ministerial instructions that will set the tenor of the next few years of squabbling.

The operative word in all those weighty proper nouns above is “markets”. The focus of this legislation, in the UK and EU, has been on the aspects of big tech that skew the free market. There are businesses that cannot exist because the operation of the App Store, Amazon’s Marketplace or WhatsApp prevents them from doing so. Those companies’ arguments are invariably that the limits they impose are for their users’ benefits; the DMCC says: “We’ll be the judge of that.”

At worst, the changes it wreaks will be zero-sum transfers from large tech companies to smaller businesses. At best, they could help kickstart a new wave of entrepreneurship, at the same time as delivering a free upgrade to every smartphone in Britain.

Take AI government seriously

View image in fullscreen The government needs to ensure that large language models are used safely and responsibly by civil servants. Photograph: Lionel Bonaventure/AFP/Getty Images

The state of the art of LLMs is already good. Better, I think, than is appreciated: as the awe has worn off, most of us have got very good at spotting the hallucinations, the stilted turns of phrase and the ease of jailbreaking the systems, and we have done so faster than we’ve worked out how to take the raw power of frontier AI models and use it to augment our own abilities.

By the end of Labour’s first term, it will be impossible to ignore how powerful this technology can be for the tasks of government – tasks which are, on an essential level, about coping with the vast quantities of information received by the state and working out how to efficiently manage and act on them.

The trick is to get started before then. Labour needs to know how, when and why it wants to use LLMs to boost the state so that it’s ready to go at the point it decides they’re competent enough to help.

For some functions, that moment may have passed. If the civil service is like any other knowledge employer, some proportion of its staff is already using ChatGPT or Claude to help proofread emails, pull together first drafts of memos or finesse lines to take; bringing that in-house would let the government ensure systems are being used safely and responsibly, while also expanding access to others who may be able to use them well but weren’t willing to stump up the cost.

In the future, more will open up, including the most dangerous part: interacting with the state. It will be a long time before any government could – or should – hand life-changing decision-making about individual citizens to an AI system; but you only have to fill in a few forms applying for disability living allowance, or an education and health care plan for a disabled child, to know that the current state is already a faceless machine with inscrutable motives. If an AI system can help people navigate that machine, rather than act as a further barrier to accessing help, then it could transform people’s relationship with the state.

And now, with just a few days before the country goes to the polls, Rishi Sunak’s campaign is being overshadowed by allegations that a stream of Tory insiders placed bets on the date of the election.

JN, London

This is an unnerving experience. It does seem likely the stranger has used your address to validate a fake identity to claim benefits or credit. The good news is that he does not appear to have stolen your names and therefore you don’t face a trashed credit rating.

Credit reports are based on an individual, not an address, and you are not liable for any bills or fines he incurs using your address.

The bad news is there’s no simple way of stopping the flow of mail other than sending it back marked “not known at this address”.

Scratch out the barcode on the envelope in case a human eye does not read and note your message. Keep your household’s entry on the electoral register up to date so that anyone not resident is removed, and keep an eye on bank statements.

The time to worry is if unfamiliar transactions start appearing in your name. You could consider applying for protective registration with the crime prevention agency Cifas.

A warning flag against your name and address will show you are at heightened risk of identity fraud, so organisations will know to carry out extra checks to ensure they are dealing with you, not a fraudster.

Figures from the British Retail Consortium (BRC) show that annual UK shop price inflation cooled last month to 0.2%, down from 0.6% in May – the slowest pace since October 2021 – as retailers cut the prices of many of their key products, including butter and coffee.

Coming before Thursday’s general election, separate figures from the RAC show that petrol and diesel prices fell for a second straight month in June to ease pressure on families affected by the cost of living crisis. The organisation said, however, that filling up on the forecourt was still “too expensive” in England, Wales and Scotland.

According to the RAC’s monthly fuel watch, the average price of petrol in the UK at the end of June was just under 145p a litre, down from 148p at the start of the month. Diesel dropped from nearly 154p to about 150p.

“Fuel prices are still nowhere near where they should be despite falling for the second consecutive month,” the RAC said. It highlighted the lower cost of filling up in Northern Ireland, where petrol is 4.5p a litre cheaper on average and diesel 8p cheaper than in the rest of the UK.

The RAC’s head of policy, Simon Williams, said: “While it’s good news prices at the pumps have fallen for the second month in a row, this also leaves a bad taste in the mouth because we know drivers in Great Britain are continuing to get a raw deal as both petrol and diesel are still much more expensive than in Northern Ireland.”

He said prices at forecourts owned and run by Shell and BP were the most expensive, highlighting Competition and Markets Authority data showing that Shell-owned sites were the most expensive in the UK.

“We remain baffled how the very same fuel can be sold for such vastly different prices by the biggest retailers, whether they’re run by supermarkets or the world’s largest oil companies,” he said.

Rishi Sunak has made lower inflation the cornerstone of the Conservatives’ general election campaign after a return in the official headline rate to the Bank of England’s target of 2% in May, down from a peak of 11.1% in October 2022.

The shadow chancellor, Rachel Reeves, however, has said pressure on household finances remains “acute” as average prices remain significantly higher than before the cost of living crisis took hold.

According to the latest snapshot from the BRC, food inflation slowed to 2.5% in June, down from 3.2% in May, in the 14th consecutive deceleration for annual growth in grocery prices. The figures suggest average prices in UK shops are continuing to rise, albeit at a slower pace than in previous months.

The chief executive of the BRC, Helen Dickinson, said retailers had, however, cut the prices of some key products including butter and coffee. Non-food prices were also in deflation – meaning average prices are falling compared with a year earlier – as shops tried to boost their sales by discounting products.

“This was particularly true for TVs with great deals to capitalise on the Euros fever,” she said. “Whoever wins Thursday’s election will benefit from the work of retailers to cut their costs and prices, easing the cost of living for millions of households.”","Britain’s next government is poised to benefit from easing pressure on household finances after a slowdown in inflation in stores and a fall in fuel prices, but costs remain “too expensive” for many families.

The Guardian,https://www.theguardian.com/money/article/2024/jul/01/uk-house-prices-nationwide-mortgage-interest-rates-wages-inflation,2024-07-01,11:15:30 UTC,"UK house prices still unaffordable for many people, says Nationwide","House prices in the UK remain unaffordable for many households despite wages rising above inflation for the typical earner, Nationwide has said.

Britain’s largest building society said prices had risen slightly in June amid the impact of higher mortgage costs, with a 0.2% month-on-month increase.

On an annual basis house price growth accelerated from 1.3% in May to 1.5% in June, leaving prices about 3% below the record high set in summer 2022. The average price of a UK home was £266,064 in June, Nationwide said.

House prices in the UK fell last year as households came under pressure from 14 consecutive interest rate rises from the Bank of England, but they remain at historically high levels relative to earnings. Prices returned to growth earlier this year, but activity has been constrained by persistently higher borrowing costs and prices remaining unaffordable for many households.

Robert Gardner, the Nationwide chief economist, said mortgage rates were still well above the record lows of 2021 and that rising costs had outstripped the benefit from stronger levels of average pay growth in recent months.

“As a result, housing affordability is still stretched. Today, a borrower earning the average UK income buying a typical first-time buyer property with a 20% deposit would have a monthly mortgage payment equivalent to 37% of take-home pay – well above the long run average of 30%,” he said.

Separate figures from the Bank of England revealed a slowdown in housing market activity in May as people borrowed £1.2bn of mortgage debt, down from £2.2bn in April. Net mortgage approvals for house purchases also fell slightly from 60,800 in April to 60,000 in May.

Official figures show average annual wage growth in the three months to April was 6%, above the rate of inflation, which fell back to the Bank’s target of 2% in May after reaching a peak of 11% in October 2022, the highest level in four decades.

The figures come as Labour and the Conservatives promise to boost housing affordability in their manifestos for Thursday’s general election, including pledges to build millions of new homes and support households with raising deposits and accessing cheaper mortgages.

Since 2010, despite a succession of government pledges, the average age of a first-time buyer in the UK has risen, rents have soared, homelessness has more than doubled and housebuilding targets have been missed.","House prices in the UK remain unaffordable for many households despite wages rising above inflation for the typical earner, Nationwide has said.

Prices returned to growth earlier this year, but activity has been constrained by persistently higher borrowing costs and prices remaining unaffordable for many households.","['unaffordable', 'newsletter', 'housing', 'nationwide', 'households', 'prices', 'mortgage', 'growth', 'privacy', 'average', 'house', 'uk']",https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/f09526788691b919054b9446aceef4e020b894a9/0_78_5616_3370/master/5616.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=e1c01248cdc1ac1ffd5401a2f620b9f2,0.04702926702926705,positive,hous price uk remain unafford mani household despit wage rise inflat typic earner nationwid said britain 's largest build societi said price risen slight june amid impact higher mortgag cost monthonmonth increas annual basi hous price growth acceler may june leav price record high set summer averag price uk home ps june nationwid said hous price uk fell last year household came pressur consecut interest rate rise bank england remain histor high level relat earn price return growth earlier year activ constrain persist higher borrow cost price remain unafford mani household robert gardner nationwid chief economist said mortgag rate still well record low rise cost outstrip benefit stronger level averag pay growth recent month `` as result hous afford still stretch today borrow earn averag uk incom buy typic firsttim buyer properti deposit would month mortgag payment equival takehom pay - well long run averag `` said separ figur bank england reveal slowdown hous market activ may peopl borrow psbn mortgag debt psbn april net mortgag approv hous purchas also fell slight april may offici figur show averag annual wage growth three month april rate inflat fell back bank 's target may reach peak octob highest level four decad skip past newslett promot sign busi today free daili newslett get set work day - well point busi news analysi need everi morn enter email address sign privaci notic newslett may contain info chariti onlin ad content fund outsid parti inform see newslett may contain info chariti onlin ad content fund outsid parti inform see privaci polici use googl recaptcha protect websit googl privaci polici term servic appli newslett promot figur come labour conserv promis boost hous afford manifesto thursday 's general elect includ pledg build million new home support household rais deposit access cheaper mortgag sinc despit success govern pledg averag age firsttim buyer uk risen rent soar homeless doubl housebuild target miss,0.04702926702926705,positive,14.0,0.04702926702926705,positive

Several lenders offer “concessionary purchase” mortgages, meaning that a tenant can buy the property they are living in from their landlord at a marked-down price.

There has been a rise in take-up as tax changes on buy-to-lets and much higher mortgage costs prompt more landlords to sell. Now TSB, one of the lenders that offers these deals, reports significant demand.

“It’s gone from a product we never really spoke about to something that regularly comes up. We’re doing a steady number … there’s a demand for it,” says Roland McCormack, TSB’s mortgage distribution director.

For tenants given the chance to buy this way, it may be the best financial deal they are ever offered. And while it involves a landlord agreeing to take a lower price than they could potentially get on the open market, it also means a quicker, smoother sale – and no estate agent fees.

How do they work, and who can get them?

Quite a few banks and building societies offer mortgages that allow someone to buy a family member’s property for less than its market value – for example, when a parent wants to help their child on to the property ladder, so agrees to sell at a discounted price.

However, some lenders also accept mortgage applications from sitting tenants wanting to buy from their landlord, and from employees wanting to buy from their employer.

These are basically standard mortgages, but with one or two key differences.

Crucially, the seller typically has to agree to sell for at least 10% below its market value. Many landlords might find that hard to swallow. However, the seller will enjoy cost savings that, it is claimed, could offset about half of that loss.

In many, but not all, cases, the tenant does not need to put down a penny of their own cash as a deposit – in mortgage-speak, the landlord is giving the tenant “a gift of equity”, which is taken by the lender as a deposit. Assuming a 10% discount, the buyer would then take out a 90% loan-to-value (LTV) mortgage.

However, the buyer may wish to put in some of their own money to boost the deposit and bring down the LTV, which hopefully will give them access to a better rate.

The discount has to be a gift, not a loan, with no conditions attached.

These deals are something of a niche product but are clearly enjoying a bit of a moment.

Which banks or lenders offer these deals?

In addition to TSB, there’s the likes of Halifax, Nationwide, Barclays and NatWest.

Terms can vary. For example, TSB and Nationwide are among those that explicitly state they do not require the tenant to put down any deposit. However, both Barclays and NatWest say buyers need to contribute their own deposit on top – a minimum of 5%.

Typically, this is going to be an arrangement between a private landlord and tenant, though TSB and Halifax say the landlord can also be a local authority, indicating this could be an option for a council tenant where the right to buy is not available.

Why would a landlord agree to do this?

A combination of a less favourable tax regime for buy-to-let properties, and a string of mortgage-rate rises over the last two years, has led to many landlords baling out of the rented sector or evaluating their options. So there will definitely be some who are keen to sell.

By selling to their tenant, they avoid paying the costs normally associated with a house sale – notably estate agent fees, which can vary from less than 1% to as much as 3.5%. It also means they will not be paying perhaps several months of mortgage interest while the property is empty and on the market.

McCormack reckons those two savings will in effect cut the amount the landlord is giving away from 10% to more like 5%. “They are still out of pocket, but it’s a much smoother transaction for them,” he adds. “They don’t have to have a tenant move out of the property, do it all up and then wait several months – all while not receiving rent.”

On top of that, the landlord does not have to bother finding a buyer and dealing with lots of inquiries about the property.

One of the key benefits for a landlord would be the speed of a sale, “and, potentially, they don’t want to do a disservice to a tenant who has perhaps been living there for a long time”, says David Hollingworth of broker L&C Mortgages. If the landlord has made a decent amount from the property and has a good relationship with the tenant, they may like the idea of helping them become a homeowner.

Is this as good as it seems for the buyer?

Yes: they typically don’t need a deposit and are saving at least 10% on the market value.

Also, they know the property and the area, says McCormack. “They know the heating works, they know the neighbourhood, they know the glitches and they know the neighbours.”

A landlord’s £31,000 ‘gift’

First-time buyers Graham and Lisa received a huge financial helping hand to get on the housing ladder in the form of a £31,000 equity “gift” from their landlord to buy the home they had been living in for over three years.

They started renting the two-bedroom bungalow near Cheltenham in late 2019, and then, early last year, the landlord said he was looking to sell.

The couple, who had been thinking of trying to buy the property, spoke to a mortgage adviser who suggested a TSB concessionary purchase mortgage.

The couple made sure the terms were OK with the landlord – in particular, the 10% discount. He agreed, and they went ahead.

The house had a market value of £310,000. Once the £31,000 discount was applied, they required a £279,000 loan.

“We put in another £20K, so the deposit was £51,000,” says Graham, 32. That meant they were able to take out a mortgage (a five-year fix) for £259,000.

“This is probably the easiest way we could have got on the ladder,” says Graham, a production engineer working in aerospace. The couple did not need to move or compete with other buyers or “deal with any of the really difficult parts of housebuying”.

They are paying more monthly than they were when they were renting. “However, it’s into a mortgage, and the property is ours. Of course, we’ve got £30K of equity we did not pay for,” says Graham.","A growing number of people are taking out a little-known type of mortgage that allows them to buy a property without having to put down a deposit.

When they arrived, they found their view of the stage completely blocked by a tent and large items of technical equipment shrouded in black plastic.

They asked to be moved and were put in the very back corner next to fans who had paid a fraction of what I had.

AXS appears to be ignoring my email suggesting they sold tickets that were not as described.

ST, Gloucester

The premium package you purchased promised “unforgettable seats” along with branded merchandise. A restricted view was not mentioned, either, on the sales page or the confirmation. “Unforgettable”, at least, was an accurate description. Your daughters say they will never forget the disappointment.

AE of Faversham, Kent fears her Taylor Swift tickets in August will be similarly memorable, for she too has booked VIP seats, paying over £1,320 for two.

Feedback and photos from friends and social media suggest that she has also invested in a view of a large tent and bulky sound equipment.

“From the row we’ve been allocated, it looks as though we’ll just about be able to see the screen but nothing else,” she writes. “I’ve asked AXS for the VIP tickets we were sold – with a view of the stage – but have had no response and neither have friends who have already attended the concert and found they could see nothing.”

Other furious fans have reported on social media that their premium seats were barricaded behind stage equipment. The tent that blocks the view, ironically, is to lodge celebrity guests who probably get their tickets gratis.

Seats with a restricted view are supposed to be advertised as such, and priced accordingly. The venues are vast, and the stage viewed from the seated areas is always going to be in the far distance. But it’s an outrage fans have seemingly been misled into paying for a first-class experience when the stage configuration prevents them seeing it at all.

Neither AXS nor its sister ­company AEG Presents, the organiser of the tour, responded to my request for comment. They don’t need to. Performances are a sellout, with fans prepared to pay any money to get a seat.

ST’s next option is to make a claim for breach of contract and statutory rights via the small claims court, now Money Claim Online. The Consumer Rights Act states that purchases must be as described and fit for purpose, and ST can claim the difference between the price she paid, and the price of the seats her daughters ended up in. According to consumer lawyer Gary Rycroft, she can also try claiming for damages.

AE’s situation is less clear-cut, he says, since she has not yet attended the concert. “If the retailer offers a full refund, the logic is she will either have to agree, or not,” he says. “A cynical retailer may take a view that Swifty is in such demand they can easily sell on a refunded ticket at a similar price with full disclosure of the restricted view.”

On the night, you could demand to be moved, citing the Consumer Rights Act, and take photos of the blocked view to support any claim.

The Guardian,https://www.theguardian.com/money/article/2024/jul/01/millions-to-pay-lower-summer-energy-bills-as-uk-price-cap-drops,2024-07-01,04:00:41 UTC,Millions to pay lower summer energy bills as UK price cap drops,"Millions of households will pay lower gas and electricity bills this summer as the energy price cap for Great Britain falls by £122 a year to the equivalent of £1,568 for the typical annual charge from today.

However, the latest cap applies only from July until the end of September, and bills are expected to rise again this winter, leaving millions struggling to heat their homes.

Monday’s adjustment reflects lower costs in the wholesale gas and electricity markets – but bills are still more than £500 a year higher than they were before Russia’s war on Ukraine upended global energy prices.

National Energy Action (NEA) has estimated that about 5.6 million households in Great Britain will remain in fuel poverty over the summer, even with lower prices.

Adam Scorer, NEA’s chief executive, said: “Any drop in energy bills is welcome, but modest falls in summer look set to be wiped out by bigger rises in autumn when people will need to put the heating back on.”

The energy price cap is expected to rise by 10% to £1,723 a year from October, according to analysts at the energy consultancy Cornwall Insight, as wholesale markets have climbed higher. It expects bills to remain at a similar level into the first months of 2025.

Analysts at the Energy and Climate Intelligence Unit (ECIU), a thinktank, have warned that energy prices are likely to remain significantly higher than they were before the Russian invasion for the rest of the decade.

The conflict has ended Europe’s gas pipeline imports from Russia, which was once its largest source of gas. This has left European markets more exposed to global energy price fluctuations as it relies more on imports from the US and the Middle East.

Europe’s gas market prices were lower in the early months of the year after a relatively mild winter, allowing energy bills to fall this summer. But markets have started to climb again, in part due to stronger gas demand from Asian economies, which will spell higher bills again this winter.

Simon Cran-McGreehin, the head of analysis at the ECIU, said: “The UK’s high dependence on gas for electricity generation and heating has cost bill payers £2,000 so far during the gas crisis, and the economy as a whole tens of billions of pounds.”

“Commonsense measures like investing in insulating the poorest homes, switching to electric heat pumps and fast-tracking British renewables will leave us less vulnerable to the whims of the international gas markets,” he said.

The consumer group Which? has urged households to take a meter reading as close to 30 June as possible “to ensure you don’t pay over the odds for any energy used after the new price cap takes effect”.

Scorer said: “Whoever is in power on 5 July inherits a fuel poverty crisis that causes misery, despair, ill-health and early death. A new government will need a new plan. Social tariffs to make energy affordable. ‘Help to repay’ programmes to reduce the debt burden. Energy efficiency schemes to build fuel poverty out of the homes of the most vulnerable.”","Millions of households will pay lower gas and electricity bills this summer as the energy price cap for Great Britain falls by £122 a year to the equivalent of £1,568 for the typical annual charge from today.

The Guardian,https://www.theguardian.com/money/article/2024/jun/29/unpaid-uk-carers-financial-hit-income-benefits-bills,2024-06-29,06:00:49 UTC,Unpaid UK carers ‘face financial hit that can last decades’,"People who look after family members free of charge are taking a huge hit to their finances which could continue into their retirement as they find themselves unable to balance paid work with their caring commitments.

Recent analysis of official figures by the financial firm Just Retirement found seven in 10 people who were receiving carer’s allowance were not in paid work, and missing out on earnings and private pension contributions.

Andresearch last year by the charity Carers UK found that 40% of those providing high levels of care for an ill, elderly or disabled relative or friend had left their employment, while 22% had reduced their working hours.

“Too often for unpaid carers in work, the immense stresses and challenges of the role with little support can mean having to reduce working hours or come out of the workplace altogether,” says Helen Walker, the chief executive of Carers UK. “This can have a significant impact on household finances, exacerbated by the current cost of living crisis.”

With just days to go until the election, the party that looks most likely to take power has said very little about what it would do to help the UK’s army of unpaid carers. The Labour manifesto does not include a single mention of the word “carer”. The Conservative manifesto does include a few brief mentions. Only the Liberal Democrats have put forward substantial proposals for better support.

Carer’s allowance is now worth £81.90 a week and is available to people who provide at least 35 hours a week of care to a disabled person.

Carers UK has been conducting an annual survey for several years, each time asking people about the impact of their role on their finances. Last year, it found 75% of those receiving carer’s allowance were struggling with cost-of-living pressures, with almost half cutting back on essentials including food and heating. The proportion saying that they were struggling to make ends meet had risen to 45%, from 39% in 2022.

The survey found that 72% were worried about the financial hit from expenses linked to caring, such as petrol for hospital visits, heating and specific dietary requirements.

Those who were employed worked in low-paid jobs as a result of the strict rules around carer’s allowance. An earnings limit means you do not qualify if you earn more than £151 a week – after that, you lose the entire benefit. The Guardian has revealed that carers who have inadvertently earned more have been taken to court by the Department for Work and Pensions.

Carers UK and Just Retirement say that these rules make it hard for people to stay in paid work.

“Removing unnecessary pressures and ensuring those who can, and want to, remain in paid work is essential,” Walker says.

She says the low level of the payments doesn’t recognise what carers do, “and there are clear problems in the way that it’s delivered, making even small amounts of work challenging. Raising the earnings limit is something that would help more carers to stay in paid work and help avoid some devastating overpayments.”

Stephen Lowe from Just Retirement says carer’s allowance was never intended to be a “wage” or payment for caring services. “However, if the rules are stopping or limiting people from taking up employment and earnings opportunities that are available to them, then we have to question whether it is fit for purpose.”

He warns that if people restrict their work or give it up entirely to provide care, “that loss of income and other work benefits such as employer pension contributions is likely to have an impact on their lives for decades to come, as well as on the businesses who lose key staff.”

Among proposals in the party manifestos for next week’s general election are a pledge by the Lib Dems to increase carer’s allowance by £20 a week and to introduce a new earnings taper of £183, after which carers would start to lose some of their allowance. Labour has previously said it would review the system but included no details in its election pledges.

Walker says that without better support for working carers, the problems they face will show no sign of abating.

“The last decade has seen a significant rise in the number of hours of unpaid care being provided and a reduction in social care available,” she says. “Our recent YouGov research revealed that 62% of UK adults – the equivalent of 10 million current or former unpaid carers – said they have had no choice about taking on an unpaid caring role.”","Carers UK has been conducting an annual survey for several years, each time asking people about the impact of their role on their finances.
Those who were employed worked in low-paid jobs as a result of the strict rules around carer’s allowance.
Carers UK and Just Retirement say that these rules make it hard for people to stay in paid work.

The Guardian,https://www.theguardian.com/money/article/2024/jun/29/council-tax-final-year-students-warned-they-could-get-surprise-bills,2024-06-29,06:00:46 UTC,Council tax: final-year students warned they could get surprise bills,"Final-year university students have been urged to check that they do not owe council tax for the last few weeks of their rented accommodation.

While students are exempt from the tax during the course, they are liable to pay as soon as they finish their final year.

The UK government says student status ends the day after the close of a university’s summer term, usually at the beginning of June.

Student accommodation leases from private landlords typically run until late June, July or even August, and this discrepancy means the risk of a surprise bill.

Megan Lloyd, a debt expert at Citizens Advice, says: “Students become liable for council tax from the day after they formally stop being a student. This could be when their course officially ends, or the day after they abandon it or get dismissed from their studies.

“For example, if a student’s final term ends on 10 June, they will become liable for council tax from 11 June,” she says.

She adds: “This only applies to final-year students; students don’t have to pay council tax during the summer holidays between years of study.”

Manchester city council has already sent out letters billing graduating students for days since term ended. Other councils are less proactive.

A spokesperson for Council Tax Advisors said: “It’s advisable for students to check with their local council for precise details, as there can be variations in how councils handle the end of term exemptions and the start of council tax liability.”

Council tax bills are based on a property’s value so how much students could become liable for depends on the property they are renting.

According to Gov.uk, from 2024 to 2025, the average bill for a band D property (priced between £68,001 and £88,000 in value on 1 April 1991) will be £2,171 a year. This is about £181 a month – a lot when a third of students live off less than £50.

Students who receive a letter or due payment notice should take action so it does not result in a debt.

There can be serious consequences for council tax arrears, including legal action or a visit from a bailiff.

Students who can prove they are no longer living in the property may be able to get an exemption at their council’s discretion.

However, for the most part, those in this position will need to pay.

It is important for students to continue checking post, especially as their housemates begin to move out of their rented accommodation.","Final-year university students have been urged to check that they do not owe council tax for the last few weeks of their rented accommodation.

The boss of Sainsbury’s said Britain needs several interest rate cuts to stimulate consumer spending, particularly on non-essential things.

Simon Roberts, the chief executive of Sainsbury’s, said:

Customers are continuing to be cautious, particularly in the areas of discretionary spending.

He said consumers’ caution was

not surprising given everything households have been through in the cost of living crisis. Until we see sequential interest rate cuts, hopefully as soon as possible, that caution from consumers is going to continue on those more discretionary items.

Roberts said when the weather improved, people spent more on things other than food. Last week, when Britain enjoyed a “mini-heatwave” Sainsbury’s sold more fans and cooling equipment than it had sold so far this year.

It just shows that when the weather does turn, customers do want to buy into what they need to enjoy the summer.

Sainsbury’s said shoppers continued to buy more items of food from its shelves than a year before but grocery sales growth slowed to 4.8% in the latest quarter from 7.3% in the previous quarter as inflation across the market eased.

At its Argos chain, sales fell by 6.2%, even though it sold 25% more TVs than a year before as sports fans prepared to watch the men’s Euro 2024 football tournament.

The retailer said the decline reflected “an unseasonal start to summer”, with cold and wet weather hitting sales of summer goods such as paddling pools and garden furniture that did well in a hot start to the summer last year.","11.38 CEST UK rate cuts needed to spur consumer spending, says Sainsbury's bossThe boss of Sainsbury’s said Britain needs several interest rate cuts to stimulate consumer spending, particularly on non-essential things.

The Guardian,https://www.theguardian.com/business/article/2024/jul/02/eurozone-inflation-eases-but-ecb-likely-to-keeping-interest-rates-on-hold,2024-07-02,11:56:21 UTC,Eurozone inflation eases but ECB likely to keep interest rates on hold,"Inflation across the eurozone slowed to 2.5% in June despite lingering pressure on households from price increases in the service sector, leaving the European Central Bank on track to keep interest rates on hold this month.

Annual inflation in consumer prices across the 20-country bloc eased from 2.6% in May, according to a flash estimate from the EU statistical agency Eurostat, matching financial market expectations.

However, core inflation – which strips out food, energy, alcohol and tobacco – remained unchanged at 2.9%, marginally higher than predicted by economists in a reflection of stubborn inflationary pressures.

Analysts said the figures were unlikely to encourage the ECB to cut interest rates again at its next policy meeting on 18 July, after it became the first big global central bank to reduce official borrowing costs, in June.

“Nothing in these figures would make the ECB cut again in July, and we think it’ll be eagerly awaiting data over the summer before seriously debating a next rate cut in September,” said Bert Colijn, the senior eurozone economist at the Dutch bank ING.

“The summer is set to be relatively boring [for the ECB]. It can afford not to carry out another rate cut based on the too-high core inflation reading and labour market strength, and will likely just await incoming data on wages, inflation and growth. It can also see how market turmoil around the French elections plays out.”

In its flash estimate for June, Eurostat figures showed services had the highest annual inflation rate at 4.1%, a stable rate compared with May. Annual price growth for food, alcohol and tobacco slowed from 2.6% in May to 2.5%.

Riccardo Marcelli Fabiani, a senior economist at the consultancy Oxford Economics, said: “Inflation resumed its descent after it had been temporarily interrupted in May, and it will continue to fall as inflationary pressures wane thanks to easing wage growth, lower energy prices and normalised price expectations. But core inflation remaining stable reminds us that the disinflationary process will be bumpy.”

The ECB cut its main deposit rate last month to 3.75% from a record high of 4%, putting it ahead of the US Federal Reserve and the Bank of England, which have yet to cut interest rates. It was the first time that the main eurozone interest rate had been reduced in almost five years.

However, the central bank’s president, Christine Lagarde, said on Monday that benign economic developments suggest that further interest rate cuts are not urgent, with a robust labour market and resilient wage growth.

The latest figures come as European stocks fell on Tuesday to the lowest level in two weeks, amid worries about the outcome of the French election and heightened economic uncertainty across the eurozone.

Pierre Roke, a senior analyst at Validus Risk Management, said rising political uncertainty and inflationary pressures could force the ECB to keep rates on hold for longer than anticipated in financial markets, where traders are poised for a second rate cut in September.

A second rate cut “feels ambitious”, he said. “We certainly see higher rates as a bigger risk from here than lower.”","Inflation across the eurozone slowed to 2.5% in June despite lingering pressure on households from price increases in the service sector, leaving the European Central Bank on track to keep interest rates on hold this month.

We need an economy based on human rights,"Economic growth will bring prosperity to all. This is the mantra that guides the decision-making of the vast majority of politicians, economists and even human rights bodies.

Yet the reality – as detailed in a report to the United Nations Human Rights Council this month – shows that while poverty eradication has historically been promised through the “trickling down” or “redistribution” of wealth, economic growth largely “gushes up” to a privileged few.

In the past four years alone the world’s five richest men have more than doubled their fortunes, while nearly 5 billion people have been made poorer. If current trends continue, 575 million people will still be trapped in extreme poverty in 2030 – the deadline set by the world’s governments to eradicate it. Currently, more than 4 billion people have no access whatsoever to social protection.

Hundreds of millions of people are struggling to survive in a world that has never been wealthier; many are driven to exhaustion in poorly paid, often dangerous jobs to satisfy the needs of the elite and to boost corporate profits. In low-income countries, where significant investment is still required, growth can still serve a useful role. In practice, however, it is often extractive, relying on the exploitation of a cheap workforce and the plundering of natural resources.

Concrete steps can be taken now, starting with choosing measures of progress other than gross domestic product

The endless quest for growth at all costs, and the escalating use of the natural resources it demands, is pushing our planet way beyond its limits. Six of the nine “planetary boundaries” – Earth’s life-support systems – have already been crossed. For too long, the health of our planet has been sacrificed for inequitable material gain.

Our economies are failing us. We urgently need to look beyond profit, beyond the short term and beyond the interests of the few.

A “human rights economy” can deliver for people and the planet because it shifts our focus from growth to humanity – grounding the purpose of the economy in fundamental, universal human values. It offers human rights as a guardrail to keep the economy on track – meeting the challenges of the climate crisis, addressing inequalities and eradicating poverty.

This proposition is not some fairytale. Concrete steps can be taken now, starting with choosing measures of progress other than gross domestic product (GDP) – which tells us nothing about the ecological or social fallout of economic activity.

And we need to start valuing what really counts. GDP has no way of accounting for the estimated 16.4bn hours spent every day worldwide on unpaid work, largely carried out by women, that underpins the global economy: caring for children, people with disabilities and older citizens.

Unpaid domestic and care work should be remunerated through paid parental and carers’ leave, included in pension calculations, and supported through access to safe water, sanitation, affordable childcare facilities and other essential services.

Financing these services while reducing our dependence on GDP growth is achievable through progressive tax policies such as inheritance and wealth taxes, preventing illegal financial flows and tax evasion, and tackling corruption. More effective international cooperation on tax, debt and social protection is also needed.

This is a major undertaking. The barriers are real: most people have been led to believe that economic growth equals human progress. Yet a growing movement is rallying against our growth-driven economic model: climate activists, workers and trade unions, scientists and academics, young people, environmental and human rights defenders, Indigenous peoples, progressive economists, and activists fighting inequality, gender disparities and colonialism are speaking out.

As world leaders prepare to gather for the Summit of the Future in September – a UN initiative that aims to forge a global consensus around what our future should look like – this groundswell of support for an alternative vision of progress must be embraced. Without a roadmap for a global economy that protects human rights, including the right to a clean, healthy and sustainable environment, the final document leaders agree in New York will continue to lead us down the path to extinction.","Economic growth will bring prosperity to all.

The barriers are real: most people have been led to believe that economic growth equals human progress.","['planet', 'need', 'human', 'economy', 'rights', 'obsession', 'tax', 'elites', 'social', 'progress', 'global', 'economic', 'growth', 'enriching', 'killing', 'world']",https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/f4f44d4a4627404169f3480e498acd4672d62a80/0_276_5184_3110/master/5184.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctb3BpbmlvbnMucG5n&enable=upscale&s=fe45a09166f7376d69208f83c498c690,0.09353022708285869,positive,econom growth bring prosper all mantra guid decisionmak vast major politician economist even human right bodi yet realiti - detail report unit nation human right council month - show poverti erad histor promis `` trickl down '' `` redistribut '' wealth econom growth larg `` gush up '' privileg few past four year alon world 's five richest men doubl s near billion peopl made poorer current trend continu million peopl still trap extrem poverti - deadlin set world 's govern erad it current billion peopl access whatsoev social protect hundr million peopl struggl surviv world never wealthier mani driven exhaust poor paid often danger job satisfi need elit boost corpor profit lowincom countri signific invest still requir growth still serv use role practic howev often extract reli exploit cheap workforc plunder natur resourc concret step taken now start choos measur progress gross domest product endless quest growth cost escal use natur resourc demand push planet way beyond limit six nine `` planetari boundari '' - earth 's lifesupport system - alreadi cross long health planet sacrif inequit materi gain economi fail us urgent need look beyond profit beyond short term beyond interest few `` human right economi '' deliv peopl planet shift focus growth human - ground purpos economi fundament univers human valu offer human right guardrail keep economi track - meet challeng climat crisi address inequ erad poverti proposit fairytal concret step taken now start choos measur progress gross domest product gdp - tell us noth ecolog social fallout econom activ need start valu realli count gdp way account estim bn hour spent everi day worldwid unpaid work larg carri women underpin global economi care children peopl disabl older citizen unpaid domest care work remuner paid parent carer ' leav includ pension calcul support access safe water sanit afford childcar facil essenti servic financ servic reduc depend gdp growth achiev progress tax polici inherit wealth tax prevent illeg financi flow tax evas tackl corrupt effect intern cooper tax debt social protect also need skip past newslett promot sign global dispatch free newslett get differ world view roundup best news featur pictur curat global develop team enter email address sign privaci notic newslett may contain info chariti onlin ad content fund outsid parti inform see newslett may contain info chariti onlin ad content fund outsid parti inform see privaci polici use googl recaptcha protect websit googl privaci polici term servic appli newslett promot major undertak barrier real peopl led believ econom growth equal human progress yet grow movement ralli growthdriven econom model climat activist worker trade union scientist academ young peopl environment human right defend indigen peopl progress economist activist fight inequ gender dispar coloni speak out world leader prepar gather summit futur septemb - un initi aim forg global consensus around futur look like - groundswel support altern vision progress must embrac without roadmap global economi protect human right includ right clean healthi sustain environ final document leader agre new york continu lead us path extinct,0.09353022708285869,positive,129.0,0.09353022708285869,positive
The Guardian,https://www.theguardian.com/world/article/2024/jul/01/greece-introduces-growth-oriented-six-day-working-week,2024-07-01,16:26:54 UTC,Greece introduces ‘growth-oriented’ six-day working week,"Companies in countries worldwide may be toying with the idea of implementing shorter working weeks, but in Greece employees have been told that, henceforth, they can put in a sixth day of labour in an unorthodox step aimed at turbocharging productivity.

After outpacing other Europeans in terms of economic growth, the nation once at the heart of the continent’s worst financial crisis has bucked the trend again, introducing a 48-hour working week. The measure, decried as “barbaric” by unions, takes effect from Monday.

“It makes no sense whatsoever,” said Akis Sotiropoulos an executive committee member of the civil servants’ union Adedy. “When almost every other civilised country is enacting a four-day week, Greece decides to go the other way.”

The pro-business government of the prime minister, Kyriakos Mitsotakis, says the initiative was made necessary by the twin perils of a shrinking population and shortage of skilled workers. Prior to announcing the legislation – part of a broader set of labour laws passed last year – Mitsotakis described the projected demographic shift as a “ticking timebomb”. In an unprecedented exodus, about 500,000 mostly young educated Greeks are estimated to have emigrated since the near decade-long debt crisis erupted in late 2009.

The six-day scheme, officials say, will only apply to private businesses providing round-the-clock services. Under the extended working week, staff in select industries and manufacturing facilities will have the option of working an additional two hours a day or an extra eight-hour shift, rewarded with a top-up fee of 40% added to the daily wage.

Either choice, the centre right government claims, will redress the issue of employees not being paid for overtime while also tackling the pervasive problem of undeclared work.

“The nucleus of this legislation is worker-friendly, it is deeply growth-oriented,” Mitsotakis said before the Greek parliament endorsed the law. “And it brings Greece in line with the rest of Europe.”

But the backlash has been fierce. In a country with almost no tradition of inspections in the workplace, critics contend the reform ultimately sounds the death knell of the five-day working week, not least because it enables employers to dictate whether a sixth day of labour is required.

For opponents, who have already taken to the streets in protest, the reform erodes legal protections and rolls back long-established workers’ rights in the name of flexibility.

“In reality this has been passed by a government ideologically committed to generating ever bigger profits for capital,” said Sotiropoulos. “Better productivity comes with better work conditions, a better quality of life [for employees] and that, we now know, is about less hours not more.”

The measure, he said, had been made possible partly because trade unions had also seen their power wane as a result of debt-stricken Athens enacting austerity measures in return for rescue funds during the country’s financial crisis. Unions have long argued that overtime enables employers to hold back on hiring more staff.

Trialled four-day week programmes have repeatedly shown increased levels of productivity with researchers attributing the outcome to improved levels of focus. Belgium in 2022 legislated to give employees the legal right to spread their working week over four days instead of five, and pilot schemes have been carried out in countries including the UK, Germany, Japan, South Africa and Canada.

Greeks already work the longest hours in Europe, putting in an average 41 hours a week according to the EU’s statistics agency, Eurostat, although surveys have also proved they get paid much less. The left-wing opposition has frequently decried “Bulgarian salaries in a country of British prices”, claiming the phenomenon has only exacerbated the brain drain.

People on pensions, who have also been encouraged to work under the legislation, have weighed into the debate.

“What the government is essentially saying is ‘go and work longer, we’ll turn a blind eye even if you’re a pensioner,’” said Grigoris Kalomoiris who heads the union of retired teachers (Pesek).

“It knows that the majority of Greeks, on an average monthly salary of €900, can only survive until the 20th of the month. This latest barbaric measure is not going to solve the fundamental problem of labour shortages and a lot of us feel it is very unfair to unemployed young Greeks who may never have a job.”","After outpacing other Europeans in terms of economic growth, the nation once at the heart of the continent’s worst financial crisis has bucked the trend again, introducing a 48-hour working week.

It was a political choice on the part of George Osborne and David Cameron to advance their class interest, cleverly camouflaged by stories of Labour profligacy when the economic crisis to which it was the alleged response was caused by a surfeit of financial deregulation advocated by Osborne and Cameron and supinely accepted by Labour.

The American political economist Clara E Mattei, in her 2022 book, The Capital Order: How Economists Invented Austerity and Paved the Way to Fascism, showed how similar policies were applied in Britain and Italy after the first world war, essentially to keep workers in their place, and how in Italy they led to the rise of Mussolini and fascism. Let us be warned.

Paul Krugman is right about the impact of austerity on the UK economy – here are a couple of reasons why. First, those who advocate the shrinking of the state fail to appreciate how the economy is interdependent. Most public authorities require tendering for services. Generally, the private or voluntary sectors get the tender. So if the public sector is starved of finance and catches a cold, the private and voluntary sectors start to sneeze too.

Second, the assumption is that if the public sector is smaller, the private sector will take up the slack. This ignores the fact that the private sector’s bottom line is its profitability and ability to satisfy its shareholders, not the public interest. In practice, this means that the private sector will cherry-pick the easy and profitable tasks, as with the failed privatisation of the probation service, while leaving anything difficult or unprofitable to the public sector.

Alternatively, as with the failed privatisation of the railways, the private sector demands subsidies out of our taxes so that it can pay a dividend to its shareholders, thereby taking money out of the system that could otherwise be used to improve the infrastructure, reduce fares, or both.

Austerity was an ideological choice by the coalition government. While I would have expected little better from the Conservatives, I would have hoped that their Liberal Democrat coalition partners would have drawn enough red lines to prevent the government from following through on its economic illiteracy and choking off the first signs of recovery from the 2007-08 crash. As it is, we’ve suffered from the consequences ever since.

Paul Krugman does an excellent job of exposing the disastrous consequences of 14 years of austerity for both society and the economy. But in solely blaming the Tories, he neglects to acknowledge the role of the Liberal Democrats in both enabling austerity and even co-authoring the genesis of the policy through the key role played by the then chief secretary to the Treasury David Laws.

Although in post for only a short time, his role was pivotal in developing the first drastic cuts in public expenditure. We now live with the consequences of 14 years of monetarist dogma ruthlessly, pitilessly and unfairly applied.

Boeing has announced the takeover of Spirit Aerosystems as it tries to retake control of its supply chain following a series of production issues. As part of that deal Airbus will take over Spirit operations serving it, including in Belfast which makes wings and fuselages for the small A220 jet. However, the Unite union has said that 40% of the 3,600 workforce is employed on parts that are not related to Airbus projects, including work for Bombardier and Rolls-Royce. Airbus did not say whether it plans to continue that work. Local politicians are concerned that job losses may result at an historic factory that traces its history back to Short Brothers, the first company to make production aircraft. First minister Michelle O’Neill and deputy first minister Emma Little-Pengelly released statements in which they said the government was working with the company to preserve the Belfast operations. Economy minister Conor Murphy said: “I have been engaging with the company and union on the acquisition and will work with all key stakeholders to ensure that the future status of the highly skilled workforce is protected.” Reuters reported: The leader of Northern Ireland’s largest unionist party, the Democratic Unionist Party’s (DUP) Gavin Robinson, said the sale represented only “a partial solution”. Steve Aiken, a member of the smaller Ulster Unionist Party, said it was an outcome “neither management, workforce or the unions desired”, calling on Northern Ireland’s economy minister to intervene to ensure the entire business is retained. “The minister also needs to emphasis to Airbus the considerable investment the Northern Irish and UK governments have made in wing and aerostructure manufacturing in Belfast and that we will not be allowing our aircraft industry to be asset stripped and manufacturing moved elsewhere,” Aiken added.

1d ago 14.45 CEST German inflation drops as European Central Bank mulls further rate cuts German inflation has dropped slightly more than expected to 2.2% year-on-year in June, as the European Central Bank (ECB) considers whether to cut interest rates again. It dropped from 2.4% in May, and was slightly lower than the 2.3% forecast. The ECB has a 2% inflation target, but it has cut borrowing costs because it believes that inflationary pressure is easing. A further reduction in inflation could support that view. Carsten Brzeski, global head of macro at ING, a Dutch investment bank, said the reading keeps the door open to further ECB rate cuts, but added that inflation “remains sticky above 2%. He wrote: Looking ahead, the stickiness of inflation at slightly too high a level looks set to continue as favourable energy base effects are petering out while, at the same time, wages are increasing. With recent new wage demands, it is hard to see German wage growth coming down in the second half of the year. Claus Vistesen, chief eurozone economist at Pantheon Macroeconomics, a consultancy, a September cut is likely. He said: said: Looking further ahead for Germany, we see scope for a further decline in headline inflation to below 2% by August, helping to get a 25 basis point rate cut over the line in September, before a rebound to just under 2.5% by the end of the year.

Photograph: Kirill Kudryavtsev/AFP/Getty Images Mark Zuckerberg’s Meta has breached the EU’s new digital laws with an advertising model that charges users for ad-free versions of Facebook and Instagram, according to the European Commission. Meta launched a “pay or consent” model last year in an effort to comply with the bloc’s data privacy rules, where users pay a monthly fee for an ad-free version of Facebook or Instagram that does not use their personal data for advertising purposes, writes the Guardian’s Dan Milmo. Users who do not pay have, as part of the signing up process for the platforms, consented to their data being used to tailor personalised adverts that appear in their social media feeds. The European Commission, the EU’s executive body, said the model does not comply with the Digital Markets Act, which is designed to rein in big tech companies. The commission issued preliminary findings from an investigation into “pay or consent” on Monday and found the model “forces users to consent” to their data being collected from multiple platforms. It also does not allow users to choose a service that uses less of their data but is broadly similar to the “with adverts” versions of Facebook and Instagram, the commission said.

1d ago 13.57 CEST Unite the union has said that Tata Steel will enter talks about “future investment for its operations and not just redundancies”, after suspending strikes. Other unions have complained that there has been no progress in the last six weeks, but Unite suggested that Tata had changed stance. Tata has stuck to its position that the two blast furnaces must close this year. However, a plan backed by counterpart unions Community and GMB suggested keeping one furnace open for longer while readying a large investment in greener technology (such as a direct reduced iron plant) to convert iron ore to iron, which could then be fed into an electric arc furnace. That plan would preserve jobs on the blast furnaces for several years, and would then require more workers to run in the longer term – although nowhere near the 2,800 employees who could be out of work by the autumn. View image in fullscreen Unite union general secretary Sharon Graham. Photograph: Jacob King/PA Sharon Graham, Unite’s general secretary, said: This is a significant development in the battle to protect jobs and the long-term future of steel making in South Wales. Investment from Labour secured by Unite will be key to the future of the site. This breakthrough would not have come about without the courage of our members at Port Talbot who were prepared to stand up and fight for their jobs. Workers were simply not prepared to stand idly by while steel making ended and their communities were laid to waste. It is essential that these talks progress swiftly and in good faith with the focus on fresh investment and ensuring the long-term continuation of steel making in South Wales. Share

1d ago 12.59 CEST Tata Steel had written to the three main unions representing steelworkers at Port Talbot offering more talks over its plans to cut 2,800 jobs as it closes the blast furnaces if the strike threat were removed. Owner of Port Talbot steelworks offers fresh talks as last furnace faces closure Read more The unions are hopeful that a Labour government would persuade Tata Steel to delay the closure of at least one blast furnace, preserving thousands of jobs for several years. Unite had threatened strike action from 8 July – after the planned closure of the first blast furnace. The other unions were hanging on for a Labour government after 4 July. Shadow business secretary Jonathan Reynolds has already been in talks with the unions and the company in an effort to avert the closures. Alun Davies, national officer for Community, which represents most of the affected steelworkers, said: With thousands of jobs at stake, we welcome Unite’s decision to withdraw their strike action and get back around the table with their sister steel unions. Tata confirmed that if the strike was called off they are ready to resume discussions on a potential [memorandum of understanding], through the multi-union steel committee which is chaired by Community. The truth is Tata never walked away from those discussions, and at our last meeting on 22 May all unions agreed to conclude the negotiations and put the outcome to our members. Community will welcome resuming those discussions, but we regret that zero progress has been made since 22 May. Share

1d ago 12.16 CEST There has been a rush of manufacturing data today. The UK’s purchasing managers’ index (PMI) from S&P Global suggests it is doing better than Europe. The PMI reading came in at 50.9 in June, still well into expansionary territory, in contrast to the two-year contraction in Europe. The reading was worse than the initial flash estimate of 51.4, and down slightly from May’s 22-month high of 51.2. View image in fullscreen Output from the UK manufacturing sector has picked up in recent months. Photograph: S&P Global Rob Dobson, director at S&P Global Market Intelligence, said: The UK manufacturing sector is enjoying its strongest spell of growth for over two years, with June seeing output and new order growth sustained at robust rates similar to May’s recent highs. The performance of the domestic market remains a real positive, providing a ripe source of new contract wins. In contrast, the ongoing weak export performance is concerning, with manufacturers reporting difficulties in securing new business in several key markets including the US, China and mainland Europe. However, that did not stop companies from making job and spending cuts and trying to run down inventories of unsold products, Dobson said. Inflation may be partly behind that: This is coming from a backdrop of renewed cost inflation pressure, with manufacturers’ input prices now rising at the quickest pace since the start of 2023. This renewed upward lurch in manufacturing prices will likely add to concerns over the potential stubbornness of underlying inflationary pressures among hawkish rate setters at the Bank of England.

The Guardian,https://www.theguardian.com/business/article/2024/jul/01/london-investment-bankers-bonuses-interest-rates,2024-07-01,05:00:44 UTC,London investment bankers to rake in bigger bonuses after two-year slump,"London’s investment bankers are expected to rake in bigger bonuses this financial year, as the City begins to recover from a two-year slump in deals caused by surging interest rates.

Demand for investment banking services – such as facilitating mergers and acquisitions, advising companies and governments on fundraising, and underwriting new stock and bonds – was hit by a sharp increase in borrowing rates after the pandemic, as central banks acted to tame runaway inflation. Jobs and pay were cut as investment banks sought to reduce costs.

But the rate hike cycle has ended, with the UK and US expected to begin reducing the cost of borrowing before Christmas. Forecasters say the recent increase in dealmaking is likely to be felt during the spring bonus season.

“The outlook for 2024 is brightening after a promising first quarter and there are signs of capital markets activity thawing after a two-year freeze,” Dartmouth Partners, a recruiter for banks, consulting firms and startups, said in its annual compensation survey covering London investment bankers.

That is likely to mean bigger bonuses for investment bankers at the London offices of “bulge bracket” firms including JP Morgan, Goldman Sachs, and Deutsche Bank, rewarding those who managed to keep their jobs and wait out nearly two years of falling payouts.

“It feels like there’s more of a an upswing happening,” the Dartmouth Partners founder, Logan Naidu, told the Guardian. “Even if the revenue is not quite there, the activity is and I would suspect that compensation would go up on last year. Will it be back up to where it was in 2021-22? I doubt it is going to be that good. But I think it will be better than than last year.”

Naidu said the UK’s decision to scrap the banker bonus cap, which previously limited bonuses to 100% of salaries, would probably mean that salary rises could be replaced with larger bonuses over the long term. “What might happen is base pay starts to get a bit more suppressed, and variable comp starts to become a larger part of the narrative again, which is probably good news for the banks in terms of how they manage their cost base.”

There is still time for most investment bankers to build their bonus pots. While junior analysts will be paid out at the end of the summer, bonus decisions for higher-level staff will be made at the end of the year.

Dartmouth Partners released data showing average pay tumbled last year across most investment banking positions at eight of the major investment banks, ranging from junior-level analysts to more senior associates and vice-president roles.

While lower-paid analysts took home bonuses worth an average of £44,267 in 2023 – marking a near 50% increase compared with a year earlier – mid-tier associates’ bonus payouts fell by nearly a fifth to £80,065 on average, sending their total pay down 8.3% to £213,940.

Meanwhile, some vice-presidents had their bonuses slashed by 22% to £135,183, reducing total average pay by 11.8% to £303,204.

The survey, which interviewed more than 250 London-based bankers – working at Goldman Sachs, JP Morgan, UBS, Barclays, Morgan Stanley, Citi, Deutsche Bank and Bank of America – found that a number of bankers working at European firms were hoping to jump ship to their American rivals, which tend to offer higher overall compensation.

But even Goldman Sachs cut pay for its vice-presidents by 7.6% on average, while its associates were hit by an 8.3% drop. JP Morgan vice-presidents experienced a 7% cut and associate pay fell by 4.6%.

London-based vice-presidents at Morgan Stanley were hit by the largest drop in total pay on average last year, with it falling nearly by 26.8%, followed by Bank of America where vice-president-level pay fell 23.5%.

Global banks collectively cut more than than 600,000 jobs in 2023, making it one of the biggest years for redundancies since the 2007-08 financial crisis.

“Even though bonuses have been poor, many bankers said they are happy to still have a job,” the survey said.

Agustín Carstens, the general manager of the Bank for International Settlements (BIS), said the world economy was on course for a “smooth landing” from the inflation crisis, but he warned that policymakers, especially politicians, needed to be careful.

Global government debt is already at record levels and elections ranging from the US presidential vote in November, to recent polls in Mexico and South Africa, and votes in France and Britain in the coming week, all carry risks.

Emmanuel Macron’s decision to call a snap election in France has sent the country’s bank stocks crashing and alarmed the bond markets, exacerbating fiscal sustainability concerns in the eurozone’s second-largest economy.

Polls released before the first round of voting on Sunday suggested the far right could win the largest share of the vote, amid record turnout.

Carstens said the BIS was not calling out any “one or two” governments but that the message was clear.

“They [governments] must cut short the rise in public debt and accept that interest rates may not return to the pre-pandemic ultra-low levels,” he said. “We need a solid foundation to build upon.”

With interest rates not about to go back to ultra-low levels, and cost pressures from ageing populations, climate breakdown and rebuilding defence capabilities, economic stimulus plans and a general rise in protectionism could unsettle sensitive markets, BIS warned as it published its annual report.

“They can surprise you with not much notice,” Carstens told reporters, pointing to the turbulence in Britain’s markets after then prime minister Liz Truss’s budget plans, which put some pension funds at risk of collapse. “You really want to avoid that.”

France’s main parties have all promised new spending. Macron’s government had promised to cut the budget deficit from 5.5% of gross domestic product last year to a European Union ceiling of 3% by 2027 – an objective that may be unattainable after the vote, which concludes with a second round on 7 July.

If it forms a government, Marine Le Pen’s National Rally (RN) wants to cut value-added tax (VAT) on energy, which it says would cost €7bn (£5.9bn) for the rest of this year and €12bn in a full year. The RN would also scrap a 2023 increase in the retirement age to 64 from 62, and says its spending plans would be paid for by cutting contributions to the EU budget.

The left-wing New Popular Front alliance, now polling second, says its first moves would include a 10% civil servant pay hike, providing free school lunches, supplies and transport while raising housing subsidies by 10%.

The turmoil has sent the cost to the French government of servicing its debt on the international markets rocketing, with the risk premium, or spread, demanded by holders of French debt over Germany’s rising to its highest level since 2012.

France’s blue-chip CAC 40 index is down 6% since Macron dissolved parliament, with French banks having been among the biggest losers. The big three – Société Générale, BNP Paribas and Crédit Agricole – are down 10%-14% since Macron’s announcement.

French banks have a large amount of debt and are expected to suffer if credit costs increase sharply.

The positive for Carstens was that central banks have successfully reined in inflation, which had hit decades-long highs after the Covid-19 pandemic, and then Russia’s 2022 invasion of Ukraine, which riled commodity markets.

“Compared to last year, I have to say we are in a much better place,” the former Mexican central bank governor said.

Although Carstens said central banks deserved praise for navigating a difficult path that could have resulted in a wave of recessions, he added that they needed to persevere, likening the inflation fight to a course of antibiotics to tackle an illness.

He described an “extreme” scenario where inflation raced up again and central banks needed to raise rates further.

The Guardian,https://www.theguardian.com/business/article/2024/jun/30/unusual-economic-indicators,2024-06-30,11:00:20 UTC,What can lipstick and underwear sales tell us about the economy?,"Is the country heading towards a recession? Ask 10 economists and you’ll likely get 10 different answers. Which is why some people have given up on the traditional data – GDP, jobs, etc – and have instead recently been tinkering with more unusual economic indicators to help them guide their companies. Here are a few that I’ve seen.

Uniform patches

One known economic indicator is jobs and for that we tend to rely on unemployment numbers from the Bureau of Labor Statistics. But maybe there’s something better. Like the number of uniform patches sold each year. Uniform patches? Yes, those are the emblems that go on the uniforms worn by millions of workers, from fast food cashiers to drywall contractors. The financial data of one of the world’s largest makers of emblems and patches – privately held World Emblem – can’t be easily obtained. But the company’s owner recently told USA Today that sales are up 19% from the same period last year. A recession? “We’re not seeing it,” says Randy Carr, CEO of the Fort Lauderdale, Florida-based company. “It’s hard to believe there would be.”

Men’s underwear

Ask any guy about underwear, and they’ll usually admit the same thing. When times are good, we’re buying the good material. When money’s tight, we’re wearing those things until they literally fall off. So do men’s underwear sales mirror the economy overall? Some – including former Federal Reserve chief Alan Greenspan – think so. If you want to check out how the men’s underwear business is doing you can look at Hanesbrands or PVH Corp (which owns several leading brands, including Calvin Klein and Tommy Hilfiger) or Ralph Lauren Corporation. “Bottom” line: men’s underwear sales have been mostly flat over the past 12 months.

Lipstick

For the most part, lipstick is a relatively inexpensive accessory, with a typical tube costing anywhere from $5 to $20. History has shown that women will cut back on more expensive beauty goods like makeup and perfume when times are tight. But lipstick? Don’t even go there. When lipstick sales increase as luxury beauty item accessories decrease, that’s another potential sign of economic headwinds. Where to research lipstick sales? Try the big cosmetics companies like L’Oreal, Estee Lauder and Ulta Beauty. All three companies have shown strong revenue gains over the past year.

Overseas freight

World shipping has a significant impact on our economy and instead of tracking units and cargo activity, some economists instead track the price of freight. Why? Because in a supply and demand world, the greater the demand for shipping, the more freight should cost. To track this phenomena, look no further than the Baltic Dry Index. This is a well-watched measure of freight costs for shipping items across the Baltic Sea, one of the world’s busiest shipping lanes. So how are freight costs doing? They’re up more than 55% over the past year and even slightly higher than pre-Covid times.

Recreational vehicles

If you’ve never taken a trip in a recreational vehicle (RV), you’re missing out. It’s fun and a great way to explore our national parks. Some economists think that RV sales are an economic indicator because RVs – a luxury item - are not only expensive to buy, but they come with high maintenance costs and tend to calculate gas usage by gallons per mile. So how’s the RV industry doing? Judging by one of America’s largest makers of these vehicles – Winnebago – not so great. Sales have been declining for the past few years and the company’s stock price has fallen 35% in the past year.

I’m only scratching the surface on unusual economic indicators. Besides RVs you can follow the sales of champagne. Instead of men’s underwear you can also track women’s hemlines (which are believed to rise and fall along with the stock market). You can dig into the buttered popcorn index (which some say increases during times of recession as a small bit of a luxury in an otherwise cruel world). You can even keep track of hairstyles in Japan, where some say that women wear their hair longer when times are good and shorter when times are tough. Good luck finding this data, let alone making any sense of it.

Goofy economic metrics like these are fun to talk about with your friends and colleagues. But they shouldn’t be taken seriously. I run a business, and my go-to economic indicator is my clients. I’ve learned that the best way to insulate my business from the economy is to diversify: have as many clients in as many industries and geographic locations as possible. The US is a big country, and even when one client is cutting back on his underwear purchases in Illinois, I’ll likely have another buying uniform emblems in Texas. Focus on this instead of lipstick.","So do men’s underwear sales mirror the economy overall?

The Guardian,https://www.theguardian.com/business/article/2024/jun/30/the-baby-bust-how-britains-falling-birthrate-is-creating-alarm-in-the-economy,2024-06-30,10:00:21 UTC,The baby bust: how Britain’s falling birthrate is creating alarm in the economy,"Having children has become an unaffordable luxury for many of her generation, says Vanessa, a 35-year-old project manager living in Brighton.

“My friends who managed to start a family, without exception, all received large sums of money from their parents to get on the property ladder. For those of us not fortunate enough, we are trapped in the rental market, largely with insecure, poorly paid employment.”

Vanessa’s outlook is also clouded by concerns about the climate crisis, crumbling public services and the “plummeting mental health of young people”, she says. “Put these into the mix and you have a perfect storm for declining birthrates.”

Her decision is replicated worldwide. The number of women of child-bearing age is in long-term decline across Europe, parts of Asia, South America and the US, a situation made worse by the steep drop in the number of women, and their partners, who either want or are able to have children.

These factors have led to a sharp fall in fertility rates – the number of children born to each woman.

While the issues facing governments from rapidly ageing populations are relatively familiar, a decline in fertility rates that was once limited to Japan has spread across the world. Today, almost every continent has a growing age-dependency ratio as average birthrates fall and people live longer. If the global population hits 10.4 billion in the 2080s as predicted, it will only be because sub-Saharan Africa has continued on its current trend, pushing the population across the African continent from about 1.5 billion to as many as 2.5 billion.

Here we look at the trends, and the implications for future governments, of a demographic revolution.

How the UK is affected

The total fertility rate across England and Wales fell to 1.49 children per woman in 2022, from 1.55 in 2021, according to the Office for National Statistics (ONS).

As a benchmark, the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) says that to maintain a population, the “replacement rate”, often known as the “R-rate”, needs to be at least 2.1 children per woman.

It has been well documented that the pandemic, rather than spark a baby boom, had the reverse effect. Yet the recent drop in fertility has shocked demographers. The rate was already declining, starting in 2010: then came Covid-19, the Russian invasion of Ukraine and a deepening of the climate crisis, which all appeared to add a further downward shift, taking the fertility rate to the lowest since comparative data began being kept in the 1930s.

Ann Berrington, a professor of demography and social statistics at Southampton University, says: “The Human Fertility Database covering England and Wales documents the 1960s baby boom, 1970s baby bust, the fluctuations of the 1980s and 1990s that kept things fairly stable, increases through 2000s to 2010, and then a decline to the historical low levels seen today.”

The trend in Scotland follows the same pattern, but on a lower trajectory during each period over the last 60 years. Northern Ireland follows the same pattern on a slightly elevated path. ONS figures tracking live births tell the same story of decline. They show 605,479 in England and Wales in 2022, a 3.1% fall from 2021 and the lowest number since 2002.

This figure is not an all-time low because the UK’s population has been expanding since 2003, when the UK embraced the free movement of people from countries that had recently joined the EU. Opening its doors to workers from eastern Europe resulted in an increase in total births, and maintained fertility rates, which were about the same for UK-born and foreign-born women at the time.

But when record numbers of women are reaching the age of 30 child-free, the effect has clearly waned.

According to the latest data, half of women born in 1990 were childless by their 30th birthday – the first generation for which that is true.

It’s the economy …

When the Observer asked readers, including Vanessa, to say why they had not had children, or had restricted the size of their family, most replied that financial constraints were the main reason.

Hannah, a 35-year-old marketing executive living in London, says she had been unable to have the two children she wanted with her partner of 10 years, despite moving to a cheaper area to secure a bigger home.

Childcare costs were prohibitively high, along with other costs of living, she says. “The family we want to have is financially out of reach. We have only ever had one holiday together since our relationship began. We are cutting down on food bills and looking for extra work to make having a child happen.” She and her partner are considering moving abroad.

In the early 00s, Britain and France were outliers in Europe. Both countries had generous family benefits and governments with a stated aim of supporting children. The scale of generosity, from tax credits for low earners to an expansion of early years centres and childcare subsidies, meant both countries – under Labour in the UK and the Gaullist centre-right in France – arrested declines over previous decades.

In the UK and France, these subsidies were scaled back after the recessions of 2008-09. Austerity across all public services was the message from Nicolas Sarkozy, France’s president from 2007 to 2012, and from the UK ’s coalition government from 2010 to 2015.

For all the impact of welfare and public service cuts, a study by Fathom Consulting indicates those interested in creating a family look further ahead. In the aftermath of the financial crash of 2008, it was clear the future for many households looked bleak, with incomes flat and costs, especially housing, on a steady incline. Without the optimism of previous generations, couples decided not to have children, according to the initial findings from a study of Japan that links declines in fertility with periods when the future outlook for the economy was uncertain.

“It turns out that there is a good relationship between forecasts of 15-year forward growth in Japan at any point in time and the fertility rate in Japan at the same point in time,” says the report.

“In other words, people have kids when they feel optimistic that, when their kids join the workforce, the standard of living they will enjoy will be better than it is now.”

To measure growth, the report used national income per capita, which has improved in Japan while the overall economy has stagnated. Japan’s fertility rate is 1.3, just ahead of Italy’s 1.2 and South Korea’s 0.8.

The consultancy’s director, Erik Britton, says the research is ongoing and the conclusions only tentative, but the initial findings reveal that government support, while a necessary element, might not be the most important factor. A nation confidently growing its economy is the comfort people need before starting a family, he says.

… but also other factors

Recent data from the UK Generations and Gender Survey tells us that the ideal family size remains relatively high, with an average of about two children. There remains evidence of a two-child family ideal.

Berrington says that when her team asked childless people whether they intend to have children, there was “a lot of uncertainty in the answers”. Higher proportions of young adults said they probably or definitely would not have children, as compared with the proportions reported by millennials at a similar age.

Fiona Powley, 49, a life coach, knew she did not want children by the age of 12, and knows many contemporaries who also prefer to be child-free; she runs the group Bristol Childfree Women. As an indication of the problem faced by any government seeking to boost fertility, she says that when she asks people as they join her community what they enjoy most about being child-free, “they talk about time and freedom: finances don’t usually feature”.

She adds: “A common judgment from others asks ‘who will look after you when you’re old?’, to which most members might say they’ve made good financial provision for older-age care and pensions as they’ve not have the financial strain of children.”

Sarah Harper, a professor of gerontology at Oxford University, says one of the main issues is equality, meaning equal treatment by the state and within a relationship.

It is only when women believe they can continue working and have spare time that they will take the plunge into motherhood, she says – though the evidence from the Nordic countries, where fertility rates have followed the general downward trend, is weak. However, it might explain why traditional South Korea’s fertility rate is so low.

“These days women say they have no obligation to reproduce and ‘I’m not going to have a baby who turns my life upside down’,” says Harper, who advised the David Cameron’s government on the implications of an ageing society.

Public services

The Treasury’s independent forecaster, the Office for Budget Responsibility (OBR), says falling birthrates are going to have a negative effect on tax receipts. That is a situation that is not necessarily solved by higher immigration.

In a recent report, it said that while every additional migrant generally boosts the level of output in the economy, “the size of this impact and the effect on per-person living standards is highly uncertain.

“The age, education, skill level, and participation rate of migrants, alongside the investment response of businesses, are all factors that determine the impact of migration on per-person output,” it said.

At the moment, the UK population is increasing – by an estimated 6.6 million to 73.7 million over the next 15 years – but the economy is on course to grow at a slower pace, meaning there is less of the financial pie to go around.

Without a healthy rise in tax receipts, governments will struggle to pay for vital services.

Schools are in the frontline of cuts as pupil numbers decline, according to the Resolution Foundation. In England, they could lose up to £1bn in funding by 2030, with exceptional falls in pupil numbers prompting closures as some establishments cease to be financially viable. Councils across the country have begun to consult local residents about mergers and closures to make the system viable.

According to the Education Policy Institute (EPI), a thinktank, the north-east is projected to see the greatest decline in primary pupil numbers, down 13% by 2028-29.

Primary school teachers could face redundancy, such is the dramatic loss of young children, says Lindsey Macmillan, an education policy expert at University College London. She says secondary schools that are now suffering teacher shortages will see the gap close as classes are cut and schools merged.

Pupil numbers had grown because of a fertility surge in the 00s, but that cohort has moved through primary and on to secondaries, leaving empty seats in their wake.

Looking ahead, even with real terms increases in per-pupil funding over the remainder of the decade, the EPI predicts that many schools will suffer funding cuts due to fewer pupils causing income to fall, though costs will remain high.

What about ageing?

Plenty of questions arise over the fact that the birthrate is falling while medical improvements are helping older people live longer. Will robots be able to look after elderly people? Could a new social contract between young and old give millennials and gen Z the security and encouragement they need to have more children? And can the UK import all the missing labour it needs, such as from sub-Saharan Africa, where births are expected to be higher?

Nik Lomax, a professor of population geography at Leeds University, says one problem faced by the next government will be how different regions are affected.

“One way of thinking about the implications of this is to assess the old-age dependency ratio – the number of people of retirement age for every 1,000 people of working age,” he says. “This reveals striking differences by geography, and will get larger over time as the number of old people relative to working age people increases.”

Just as fertility rates are falling fastest in the north-east, Wales, the south-west and parts of the Midlands, the dependency ratio is increasing in these regions too.

Harper says a clear trend shows fewer people entering the workforce and older people living longer, and not necessarily in good health.

“Men in areas that rank in the lowest third by average incomes will live until they are 80, but spend their 70s in ill health,” she says. “Men who live in the top third of affluent areas will live until their late 80s and won’t be ill or have a disability, on average, until they are 80.”

Harper says the Cameron government put ageing into its industrial strategy and considered many of the implications of falling birthrates and rising levels of ill health among a growing number of over-65s. But the industrial strategy and policy initiatives were later jettisoned.

Given that we are not going to change the dynamics of fertility rates and have women go back to producing three to four children, we need to extend people’s lives in a healthy way, Harper says.

Berrington says the implications for policymaking are “very significant – for example, the short-term decline in demand for childcare, maternity services and other parts of the economy that depend on people buying goods and services for children. “Policy responses to low fertility have tended to focus on ways to increase fertility,” she says. “However, many pronatalist policies do not work, especially cash benefits, as they tend to just bring forward in time births that would happen anyway, and not increase the overall number of births.”

Pronatalist policies – those that attempt to boost the birthrate – are also often problematic in terms of entrenching gender inequality and reducing reproductive freedom.

A report by the Social Market Foundation thinktank in 2021 said the tens of billions of pounds it would take to support an expansion of family welfare could be better spent. “We do not recommend that the government pursues a distinct ‘population strategy’ to increase the birthrate. However, the government should convene a cross-departmental working group to examine how different policies affect the birthrate,” it said.

Berrington says healthy ageing is crucial to the prospects for the economy, providing more workers and helping fill the state’s coffers.

“And governments will need to look to other policy solutions, such as increasing employment among groups which for different reasons – poor mental wellbeing, or because they have young children – have relatively high inactivity rates.”","These factors have led to a sharp fall in fertility rates – the number of children born to each woman.

The Guardian,https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/article/2024/jun/30/labour-needs-billions-to-fund-its-plans-and-i-know-where-it-can-be-found,2024-06-30,08:00:16 UTC,Labour needs billions to fund its plans – and I know where it can be found | Will Hutton,"Since its foundation in 1900, the Labour party has had a Janus-headed attitude to capitalism. It needs capitalism to be successful, dynamic and job creating, even while it instinctively distrusts capitalism, with its capacity to generate extreme inequality, invest too little, cut corners and treat workers exploitatively. But its past efforts at improving things – nationalisation, top-down planning, championing strong trade unions or simply (as New Labour did) largely giving capitalism its head – have not been notably successful. It has been a standoff that the Conservative party has ruthlessly exploited.

The seismic importance of 4 July is that Conservatism’s approach to wealth generation – trying to shrink the state whose size and excess taxes supposedly “crowds out” suppressed investment and enterprise – is exposed as a dead end of stagnant living standards and eviscerated public services. Keir Starmer, boxed in by this dreadful legacy, has declared that Labour will become the party of growth and wealth generation. Only thus can sustained tax revenues be generated to repair the ravages of the past 14 years. My bet is that he has a better than even chance of pulling it off – and transforming Labour into Britain’s natural party of government.

His first advantage is that the economic evidence is unambiguous: the state does not “crowd out” investment, and low taxes do little to stimulate enterprise. What capitalism needs from the state is well-designed and stable policy that proactively manages the business cycle while “crowding in” innovation, infrastructure and abundant fit-for-purpose training, and shapes the savings system to deliver buoyant company share prices – the necessary if insufficient precondition for raising capital to enable higher investment and a startup and scale-up boom.

This is becoming the new common sense in business, finance and the financial markets. It is why investors are buying shares anticipating a Labour government, and why Dame Amanda Blanc, CEO of Aviva, suggested last week that there could be as much as £100bn from UK insurers ready to flow into business investment if chancellor Rachel Reeves can deliver her promises on stability. That alone would go some way to lift British public and private investment by £100bn every year – the scale of the gap between us and our major competitors – while not risking another Liz Truss-style fiasco.

One important avenue to growth, cited in the Labour manifesto, is the prospect of unleashing some of the £1.4tn funds fossilised in Britain’s 5,100 defined benefit pension fund schemes. Linked to a generous fraction of workers’ final year’s pay, they have become a financial burden. To wind them up, companies have closed them to new members, creating a £1.4tn universe of wholly risk-averse zombie funds. They need to be consolidated into bigger funds that can take risks – and the money made to work to accelerate Britain’s investment recovery.

There is the tool to hand. One of the most startling policy successes of the past 20 years has been New Labour’s Pension Protection Fund (PPF), established in 2005, which takes over the management of distressed defined benefit pension funds, guaranteeing the future pensions. Managed with great professionalism, the PPF has already consolidated more than 1,100 pension funds and is currently worth £33bn with a £12bn investment surplus – one of the most successful funds of its type globally in securing high investment performance. Industry insiders believe that there is another £600bn locked up in small, high-cost zombie funds that could be liberated for productive investment.

The first staging post would be to scale up the current PPF to at least £100bn. Conservative objections that this would leave the pension funds with no fiscal backstop can be easily overcome; backed by the state, the PPF will become the new backstop via a guarantee that does not score as public borrowing. Nor, because the PPF is so rich, would the state ever be at risk. Reeves will be on her way.

Britain would have an investment trio of financial institutions dedicated to multibillion-pound economic development

After all, such a guarantee is already delegated to the UK Infrastructure Bank (UKIB) to underwrite £10bn of commercial bank lending on infrastructure projects. Reeves should lift the facility to £50bn. A similar guarantee would enable the British Business Bank (BBB) to offer venture debt to startups and scale-ups, and seek out promising companies to back: there is an estimated annual shortage of up to £10bn of venture lending that needs to be closed. My understanding is that a scaled-up PPF would support both the UKIB and BBB; at a stroke, Britain would have equipped itself with an investment trio of financial institutions dedicated to serious multibillion-pound economic development and resultant growth – without additional direct government borrowing. It’s a fiscal get-out-of-jail-free card.

Against this background, Reeves can use her proposed rewriting of the fiscal rules to supplement public investment directly. The Financial Times recently reported that asset managers would buy an extra £20bn-£30bn of government debt if it were earmarked for investment projects and R&D. Altogether, the UK’s growth rate could accelerate to above 2.5% by the end of the parliament, with even the dropped £28bn target for green spending met. Growth would be higher again the more Britain regained access to lost EU markets.

In the near future, before growth kicks in, Starmer and Reeves may have to increase the current yields from capital gains, inheritance and council tax by up to another 1% of GDP. But overall there will be the funds to resuscitate education, the NHS, local government, defence, the criminal justice system, the arts and welfare. Do I dream? Some commitments are in the manifesto, others set out in Reeves’ Mais lecture in March, others have not been excluded during the election campaign, and the ambitious teams in the investment trio are all standing by for the call.

Some in the Treasury will oppose. And never underestimate the conservatism and parochialism of the pension fund world. Geopolitics may kill all hopes. But Britain under Labour could at last fulfil its economic promise and build a high-investment, inclusive, high-wage capitalism that treats its workers fairly. This time, no mistakes.","Since its foundation in 1900, the Labour party has had a Janus-headed attitude to capitalism.

The Guardian,https://www.theguardian.com/business/article/2024/jun/30/if-workers-rights-are-a-bit-french-as-the-tories-suggest-then-vive-la-revolution,2024-06-30,06:00:14 UTC,"If workers’ rights are ‘a bit French’, as the Tories suggest, then vive la révolution | Heather Stewart","To the stirring strains of the Marseillaise, a monochrome Angela Rayner reels off her plans for workers’ rights, as a red beret and a Gallic moustache jiggle around her head. “Angela Rayner’s Britain?” demands the title, alongside a tiny tricolour.

Tory messaging has become ever more bizarre as this gaffe-strewn campaign lurches towards a close, but Thursday’s example, warning that Labour may make the UK’s labour market un peu French, hit new heights of weirdness.

For one thing, the mention of France seems more likely to evoke pleasant holidays than picket lines. More importantly, polling suggests the policies Rayner set out in the clip – employment rights from day one of a job, banning fire and rehire, binning bogus self-employment – are popular with the public.

Recent TUC polling found that two-thirds of people supported employees having the right to unfair dismissal from day one – including 61% of 2019 Tory voters. Similarly, two-thirds were in favour of a ban on fire and rehire.

Two things probably underlie the groundswell of opinion that tougher rules are needed in the labour market. One is the plain fact that too many people have found themselves working hard and still un­able to make ends meet. Real wage growth has been all but stagnant for the best part of 15 years, with average earnings a pathetic £16 a week higher than in 2010 – despite significant increases in the minimum wage (rebranded as the “national living wage”) under successive Conservative governments.

Against that backdrop, it is hardly surprising some feel the balance has tipped too far from workers to employers – a sentiment that perhaps also partly explains the ­support for public sector strikes last year.

It is more than that, however: there is a sense not just of a lack of bargaining power, but of unfairness, injustice even, in the way the labour market works for those trapped at the bottom.

From “self-employed” gig economy workers summarily laid off via an app to social care staff exploited by rogue employers and shift workers unable to plan childcare because of last-minute changes, there is an infuriating impotence about so many people’s interactions with the labour market. That is only likely to increase as new technologies are used to monitor and even manage workers as they go about their jobs.

In theory, Labour’s new deal for working people should help to turn the tide, particularly when combined with the tougher approach to enforcement Rayner has promised.

Social care is set to be the testing ground for a new approach of “fair pay agreements” under which employers and unions will have to hammer out terms and conditions that ministers will then apply across the sector.

Unions will be given the right to enter workplaces and make the case for membership – something the GMB has only just won at Amazon’s Coventry warehouse under strict conditions as part of a statutory ballot. And a new Labour government would consult about establishing a single employment status, abolishing the halfway house of “worker”, which comes with more obligations than rights.

As with so many areas of Labour’s agenda, however, the details will be critical – as will timing. Fair pay agreements were introduced in New Zealand in 2022, but implementation took so long that not a single one had come into force before the government changed and the plan was scrapped.

When, as seems likely, Rayner arrives at her desk as deputy prime minister on Friday, she will face intense pressure to water down the plans from business groups – and from some in her own party.

The Tory attack video ­echoed a line that originated with the CBI’s president, Rupert Soames, that Labour is poised to create a “European model” for the labour market. It is worth stressing how far away the UK is from that at present: Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development data suggests that 26% of workers here are covered by collective bargaining, for example, compared with 100% in Italy, 98% in France and 54% in Germany.

Regulation of the labour market has the potential to change millions of people’s lives for the better

But Soames’s concerns will find an echo among some in Labour. Furious unions confronted the party earlier this year over what they saw as an effort to undermine the new deal for workers – with union insiders claiming the shadow chancellor, Rachel Reeves, was keen to burnish her business credentials by being seen to push back against the plans. A fragile peace broke out after a face-to-face meeting between union general secretaries and shadow cabinet members, including Keir Starmer, but much about the fine details will only become clear the other side of the election.

The necessity to regain business backing has been a key part of Labour’s plan to win Thursday’s vote. If it succeeds, as polls suggest, the question facing the party on Friday will be a very different one: how to wield that power?

Regulation of the labour market is knotty, unglamorous and the subject of intense lobbying, but it has the potential to change millions of people’s lives for the better. Rayner should embrace the beret, face down the doubters and be bold.","Tory messaging has become ever more bizarre as this gaffe-strewn campaign lurches towards a close, but Thursday’s example, warning that Labour may make the UK’s labour market un peu French, hit new heights of weirdness.

The upward revision to Q1 GDP growth from 0.6% quarter-on-quarter to 0.7% q/q this morning (see opening post) suggests whoever is Prime Minister this time next week may benefit from the economic recovery being a bit stronger than expected.

So says Paul Dales, chief UK economist at Capital Economics.

He told clients that the economy may grow faster than expected this year – a boost to the winner of next Thursday’s general election.

The larger rise in GDP in Q1 was mainly due to upward revisions to consumer spending (from +0.2% q/q to +0.4% q/q) and the contribution from net trade (from +0.4ppts to +0.6ppts) more than offsetting downward revisions to government spending (from +0.3% q/q to 0.0% q/q) and residential investment (from +4.1% q/q to +3.2% q/q). The revision suggests that real GDP growth in 2024 as a whole may be more likely to come in a bit above our existing forecast of 1.0%.

Dales adds:

It now looks as though real household disposable income will grow by more than our forecast of 2.0% this year and we are expecting a solid 3.5% gain next year too. This underpins our forecast that consumer spending will be the main driver of a rise in GDP of at least 1.0% this year and about 1.5% next year. Should the saving rate fall back from its unusually high level, the economic recovery could be even stronger. This is certainly good news for whoever will be the Prime Minister this time next week, although it could also contribute to the Bank of England cutting interest rates a bit slower than otherwise.","So says Paul Dales, chief UK economist at Capital Economics.

The upward revision to Q1 GDP growth from 0.6% quarter-on-quarter to 0.7% q/q this morning (see opening post) suggests whoever is Prime Minister this time next week may benefit from the economic recovery being a bit stronger than expected.

So says Paul Dales, chief UK economist at Capital Economics.

He told clients that the economy may grow faster than expected this year – a boost to the winner of next Thursday’s general election.

The larger rise in GDP in Q1 was mainly due to upward revisions to consumer spending (from +0.2% q/q to +0.4% q/q) and the contribution from net trade (from +0.4ppts to +0.6ppts) more than offsetting downward revisions to government spending (from +0.3% q/q to 0.0% q/q) and residential investment (from +4.1% q/q to +3.2% q/q). The revision suggests that real GDP growth in 2024 as a whole may be more likely to come in a bit above our existing forecast of 1.0%.

Dales adds:

It now looks as though real household disposable income will grow by more than our forecast of 2.0% this year and we are expecting a solid 3.5% gain next year too. This underpins our forecast that consumer spending will be the main driver of a rise in GDP of at least 1.0% this year and about 1.5% next year. Should the saving rate fall back from its unusually high level, the economic recovery could be even stronger. This is certainly good news for whoever will be the Prime Minister this time next week, although it could also contribute to the Bank of England cutting interest rates a bit slower than otherwise.","So says Paul Dales, chief UK economist at Capital Economics.

Gross domestic product (GDP) rose by 0.7% in the first three months of 2024, revised upwards by the Office for National Statistics from a first estimate of 0.6%.

The first-quarter figures were lifted by growth in the services sector, up by 0.8%, as well as the production sector, which expanded by 0.6%, although that was revised down from 0.8% in the initial estimate. Other areas of the economy fared less well, with bad weather hampering the construction sector, where output fell by 0.6%.

The data confirmed that the UK was the fastest-growing economy in the G7 during the first quarter after a short recession in the second half of last year.

Real household disposable income – how much each home is left with after tax, adjusted for inflation – is estimated to have increased by 0.7% in the first quarter of this year, matching the growth in the final quarter of 2023, according to the ONS.

The strength of the economy has been a big issue in the general election campaign after voters suffered a squeeze from higher inflation and increased mortgage rates over the past three years.

Rishi Sunak has insisted that the UK economy has turned a corner but the latest encouraging data comes less than a week before polling day.

The Resolution Foundation thinktank said living standards – as measured by real household disposable income per head – were up by 2.4% as a result of pay rising faster than prices.

Despite the improvement as cost of living pressures have eased, living standards over the 2019-24 parliament as a whole fell by 0.6%, leaving the average person £120 a year worse off than they were at the time of the last election.

Adam Corlett, the thinktank’s principal economist, said it was only the third time since the first world war that living standards had been lower at the end of a parliament than at the start.

The UK economy showed no growth in April, with an increase in the services sector offset by falls in production and construction after heavy rain hampered building work and deterred shoppers from spending on the high street.

However, more recent figures show consumer confidence is returning – bolstered by falling inflation and stronger retail sales. UK inflation fell to 2% in May returning to the official target rate for the first time in nearly three years. Figures released last week showed retail sales bounced back with 2.9% growth in May after a weather-affected drop of 1.8% the previous month.

Economists said the improving economy was likely to benefit the incoming prime minister, with the Bank of England widely expected to cut interest rates later this year.

“It now looks as though real household disposable income will grow by more than our forecast of 2.0% this year and we are expecting a solid 3.5% gain next year too,” said Paul Dales, the chief UK economist at the research company Capital Economics.

“This is certainly good news for whoever will be the prime minister this time next week, although it could also contribute to the Bank of England cutting interest rates a bit slower than otherwise.”

Dales said the household savings ratio – the proportion of disposable income saved rather than spent – stood at 11.1% in the first quarter, its highest level since the second quarter of 2021.

Households tend to save more when they feel uncertain about the future, and the savings ratio rose during the cost of living crisis. Dales said that should the savings ratio come down from its “unusually high level” growth could be stronger than the 1% and 1.5% he was expecting for 2024 and 2025 respectively.","The UK economy grew at a faster rate than previously thought in the first quarter of 2024, handing the next prime minister an improved economic backdrop.

Unless the polls are wildly inaccurate, the Conservative party is heading towards a catastrophic defeat in the coming election.

All across the rich world, voters are angry at their governments – they blame politicians for a burst of inflation that happened almost everywhere and is now subsiding almost everywhere, including in the UK. But the Conservatives deserve defeat more than most: they took power 14 years ago promising to deliver responsible policies and economic success. Instead they have presided over economic stagnation and a collapse in public services.

Why has Conservative governance gone so badly? It is natural to blame Brexit, which did indeed increase trade frictions and therefore surely had a negative effect on British real income. However, Brexit has not had the disastrous effects some predicted, and has somewhat perversely led to a rise rather than a fall in immigration, especially of the highly skilled.

In fact, the roots of Britain’s poor economic performance are older and deeper than Brexit. Though many bad decisions undoubtedly contributed, one central cause was the way David Cameron and George Osborne gratuitously embraced fiscal austerity when they came to power after the global financial crisis.

At the time, this looked like an obvious macroeconomic error; more than a decade later, it has become a social and political catastrophe.

Let us recall the circumstances when the Conservatives took power. The financial crisis had produced a severe global recession; by 2010 the world economy was growing again, but all major economies, Britain included, were still operating far below capacity and had high unemployment.

Textbook economics tells us that when unemployment is high and inflation is low, governments should try to stimulate demand with reduced interest rates and fiscal deficits. Interest cuts were not an option because rates were already close to zero, so the indicated policy was fiscal stimulus.

Yet the Cameron government chose to do the opposite, pulling back fiscal support from an economy that still needed it badly. Britain was not the only nation turning to fiscal austerity in the face of high unemployment – Greece engaged in savage austerity, while Portugal, Spain, Italy and Ireland made large cuts, and fiscal policy in the US also turned contractionary.

What made the British case unique was that it was almost entirely an unforced error. Southern European austerity was a response to pressure from the bond markets: Greece was in effect cut off from private markets, while other nations faced sharply increased borrowing costs, becoming dependent on official lenders who insisted on budget cuts as a condition for loans. Bond buyers never lost faith in the US, but after 2010 Barack Obama faced a deeply hostile Congress, which in effect blackmailed him into spending cuts by threatening to provoke a government default.

While Britain had low borrowing costs like the US, its government was not divided. The Cameron executive could have chosen to maintain spending. Why did it turn to austerity?

Part of the answer is that policymakers were genuinely spooked by the sudden emergence of the crisis in Greece. Until Greece hit the wall, debt crises were generally thought of as a problem that happened only in poorer nations. It is understandable that many observers, at least initially, wondered if the Greek crisis was the leading edge of a broader attack by bond vigilantes.

But UK debt was clearly far smaller relative to the economy than Greece’s – and it became obvious early on that contagion from the Greek debt crisis was restricted to eurozone nations. So there was no reason to continue believing that the UK risked “becoming Greece”, as many politicians recklessly claimed at the time.

In fact, it soon became clear that even the eurozone crisis was more a matter of market panic than one of fundamentally unsustainable levels of debt. As the economist Paul De Grauwe has said, nations with debts in another country’s currency can suffer something similar to a bank run: panicked investors seeking to pull out their funds can cause a government to run out of cash, forcing it into default. Nations that borrow in their own currency are not vulnerable to such a self-fulfilling crisis, because they can in effect print money in a crunch.

This analysis was validated in 2012 when Mario Draghi, the president of the European Central Bank (ECB), said three words: “Whatever it takes.” This was taken to mean that the ECB would, if necessary, supply cash to governments facing a market panic. And suddenly the euro “debt” crisis faded away, with investors demanding much lower interest rates on the debt of Italy, Spain and so on.

Since Britain has not adopted the euro and had debts in its own currency, it was not vulnerable to this kind of cash crisis.

The bottom line is that there was no pressing economic need to slash spending in the face of high unemployment. I would argue that the best way to explain Britain’s austerity is not economic but sociological.

Sociology? I used to talk about the push for austerity being led by Very Serious People (a term I borrowed from the blogger Duncan Black). This was not really a joke: if you spend any time consorting with members of the global policy elite, you realise that many of them are driven primarily by the desire to appear “serious”. In economic terms, this usually means pushing policies that will cause significant hardship – to other people, of course.

The obsession with perceived seriousness reflects peer pressure, but in some ways also reflects personal careerism. Officials in democratic nations cannot expect to remain in office for more than a few years. What do they do next? If they have lobbied for “serious” policies, they can have a bright future giving speeches at Davos about the importance of making “tough choices”. Or they might even end up employed by the financial industry to lobby their former colleagues – where a reputation for “seriousness” is a prerequisite, no matter how much damage those policies have caused. (Indeed, Osborne has done both.)

Sociology partly explains the Conservative embrace of austerity. But there was also political calculation. Denunciations of debt and deficits often go hand in hand with demands for smaller government, in particular a shrunken welfare state. In effect, politicians whose real goal is to move policy to the right exploit fear of deficits to push an agenda that would be deeply unpopular if stated openly. The Oxford economist Simon Wren-Lewis calls this the “deficit deceit” hypothesis. The deceit aspect is especially obvious in the US, where Republican leaders routinely denounce deficits while pushing for budget-busting tax cuts. But there is every reason to believe that the same kind of cynicism played an important role in UK austerity.

It turns out, however, that exploiting debt fears to engineer cuts in public spending tends not to work out quite the way that small-government advocates hope.

What serious conservatives – they do exist – want is a less generous social safety net, with fewer income transfers to households, while governments concentrate on those functions that only government can perform. I do not share that desire, but never mind. What is important is that voters do not share that desire: cutting direct financial aid is deeply unpopular.

What does this have to do with deficit deceit? Even when a government manages to build support for spending cuts by scaring the public about debt and deficits, it generally finds itself shying away from spending cuts that will directly affect families’ incomes. Instead, it tries to save money by shortchanging public investment and public services, a strategy that seems preferable because the consequences of these spending cuts may not be all that visible in the short run.

But the effects of inadequate public investment cumulate over time, so that a fiscal strategy advertised as an exercise in responsibility ends up being deeply irresponsible, leading to crumbling infrastructure and deteriorating public services. This is how Cameron and Osborne’s error has compounded over the past decade.

Consider the NHS. I am clearly not an expert on the system, and I am sure that the NHS’s problems have multiple causes. But it is obvious to an outsider that direct public provision of healthcare, while it has major advantages, creates a special form of political vulnerability.

Compare the NHS with single-payer systems – including Medicare, which serves older Americans – in which the government pays the bills but does not employ the doctors or operate the hospitals. An attempt to save money by underfunding Medicare would provoke an immediate public outcry – in fact, false rumours of such a move created an outcry in 2010. But a government can underfund the NHS for years before the consequences become obvious to voters, and by that time the crisis can be very hard to fix.

To sum up: a decade ago, the main critique of austerity was macroeconomic – it was holding back recovery from the severe recession that followed the global financial crisis. And it did. But that was not the end of the story. Austerity also gradually undermined public services, including healthcare.

What will a Labour government do to reverse this damage? There are two reasons to worry it will fall short.

First, the era of Conservative austerity coincided with an era of low interest rates and substantial excess capacity, exactly the conditions under which Britain should have been investing in its future. The current environment is much less favourable.

Second, Labour’s stated plans lack any ambition to reverse austerity. In the US, the Biden administration came in with bold plans and managed to accomplish a significant fraction of them despite having only a razor-thin congressional majority. I am not hearing anything comparable from Labour, even though Keir Starmer seems on course to have political capital beyond the wildest dreams of US progressives.

I hope to be proved wrong. But right now it looks as though the shadow of austerity policies adopted in error 14 years ago will continue to darken Britain’s prospects for many years to come.","Though many bad decisions undoubtedly contributed, one central cause was the way David Cameron and George Osborne gratuitously embraced fiscal austerity when they came to power after the global financial crisis.

The Guardian,https://www.theguardian.com/politics/article/2024/jun/27/labour-europe-eu-brexit-jonathan-reynolds,2024-06-27,16:47:34 UTC,Labour to seek ‘stable position’ with Europe rather than reopen Brexit debate,"Labour would rather have stability in the UK’s relationship with Europe than try to seek accelerated economic growth by rejoining the EU’s single market or customs union, the shadow business secretary has said.

Addressing the British Chambers of Commerce (BCC) conference on Thursday, Jonathan Reynolds acknowledged that Brexit had been “very difficult for businesses” because it had erected trade barriers, but said reopening the debate would be worse.

With less than a week to go until polls open in the general election, Reynolds was trying to woo business leaders at the London event with a pitch that emphasised policy stability and encouraged businesses to invest.

Some business leaders and economists have said Labour’s hopes to grow the economy – and thereby pay for improved public services – could flounder without improved access to EU trade. But Reynolds argued that returning to the tumultuous debate over Brexit would be economically harmful because businesses would hold back investments further.

“You could not relive the argument and provide people with the assurance they need that we are moving to a period where British politics is going to be in a stable position rather than frankly causing you more difficulties,” he said.

“The practical, trade-based agreements that we put forward, rather than the constitutional arguments around customs unions or single markets, are a genuinely better way to do that.”

Kemi Badenoch, Reynolds’s Conservative counterpart, appeared later at the same event. She portrayed a Labour government as a threat to the sector and said her party believed in the “power of business to do good”.

However, the business secretary focused much of her appearance on “my favourite topic, of course, the divisive topic of identity politics”.

Badenoch compared Labour plans to monitor ethnic pay disparities to apartheid South Africa, saying she thought that the policy – an idea previously proposed by the Tory prime minister Theresa May – was “morally repellent” and claimed Labour wanted ethnicity to influence pay.

Labour’s manifesto does not say ethnicity should influence pay. The party has pledged to “enshrine in law the full right to equal pay for Black, Asian and other ethnic minority people” as well as make larger companies report the gap between pay for disabled and ethnic minority employees and the broader workforce. The Conservative party introduced similar gender pay gap reporting in 2017.

Shevaun Haviland, the BCC’s director general, told the conference that the political parties must stop “walking on eggshells” and try to improve the UK’s relationship with Europe, notably on aligning food and drink regulations, VAT and mutual recognition of professional qualifications. However, she added that Reynolds was right that “businesses don’t want a renegotiation”.

Amanda Blanc, the chief executive of the FTSE 100 insurer Aviva, told the conference that “an air of weariness and cynicism hangs over our economy” and that some of the “doom and gloom” was justified. However, she said she was optimistic that stable public policy after the election would allow businesses to invest in growing the economy.

Labour’s emollient message to business contrasts with 2019, when it lost the last election under the leadership of Jeremy Corbyn. Reynolds said the party’s relationship with business was “one of the most visible ways that Labour has changed since 2019”.

He was challenged at the conference by the owners of one business who said they were concerned about Labour’s pledge to give workers stronger rights, such as statutory sick pay and parental leave, from their first day of employment rather than after two years.

Fintan and Alison Galvin, a couple who serve as the chief executive and chief people officer of the Surrey-based software company Inv Group, said they were concerned that the changes would make it riskier for them to hire and train new workers.

“It seems very anti-business,” Alison Galvin said. “All of a sudden to have this potential curveball … You’ve got your probation period, but then after that what does that all look like?”

Fintan Galvin said: “To grow a business you’ve got to take risks. Anything that enhances a risk profile of employing a person is bad.”

Reynolds said he did not believe that Labour’s changes would affect the company’s recruitment practices, and he invited them to meet him to discuss their concerns.

During the election campaign Labour has also avoided making surprise policy announcements, mostly sticking with longstanding policy. Reynolds defended the party against accusations of running a boring campaign.

“I’m told by some commentators they don’t think Labour’s campaign is exciting enough,” he said. “Look, my friends, we’re not pitching you a new Netflix series, you know, we’re not putting on politics as entertainment.”","But Reynolds argued that returning to the tumultuous debate over Brexit would be economically harmful because businesses would hold back investments further.
She portrayed a Labour government as a threat to the sector and said her party believed in the “power of business to do good”.
However, she said she was optimistic that stable public policy after the election would allow businesses to invest in growing the economy.

The Guardian,https://www.theguardian.com/business/article/2024/jul/01/roaring-kitty-keith-gill-chewy-stock,2024-07-01,14:10:13 UTC,Chewy shares stage short-lived rally as filing reveals ‘Roaring Kitty’ takes stake,"Shares of Chewy rose 15% premarket on Monday, before reversing sharply, after a filing showed Keith Gill, the stock influencer known as “Roaring Kitty”, had picked up a 6.6% stake in the pet products e-retailer.

The turbulent rally comes days after the investor, known for triggering the meme-stock rally of 2021, posted an uncaptioned picture of a puppy on the social media platform X that briefly sent Chewy shares to a near one-year high on Thursday.

Chewy reversed all its gains and entered the red shortly after the New York Stock Exchange opened on Monday. It finished the day down 6.6%.

The filing with the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), which lists Gill as the reporting person, included a section “Check the appropriate box to designate whether you are a cat” under which the descriptor “I am not a cat” was checked.

The SEC, Chewy and Gill did not immediately respond to requests for comment.

The filing showed that Gill owns 9m shares of Chewy, equating to a stake worth about $245m at the stock’s Friday closing price of $27.24. The stake would make Gill Chewy’s third-largest shareholder, according to LSEG data.

Meme stocks – boosted by memes on social media – first e​merged as a force three years ago, when amateur traders mobilized on platforms including Reddit to boost shares in GameStop.

Their bids triggered an extraordinary, but fleeting, increase in GameStop’s stock market value. It also left hedge funds that had bet against the company nursing heavy losses.

Gill, who led an army of retail investors backing GameStop, is known for his posts on Reddit – where he is known as “DeepFuckingValue” – and YouTube. While silent on the platforms for years after 2021’s frenzy, he has re-emerged in recent months.

Shares of Chewy, which sells pet food as well as medicine online, have risen 15% so far in 2024 but declined in the three preceding years as spending on pets slowed after a post-pandemic boom.

Its sales have been stable in the past few quarters despite weaker consumer spending on discretionary items. “Pet humanization” is a key part of Chewy’s strategy, in which owners splurge on pets as they are considered a part of the family.

Some analysts said last week that Gill’s interest in Chewy could also be influenced by the fact that the pet retailer was founded by GameStop CEO Ryan Cohen.","Shares of Chewy rose 15% premarket on Monday, before reversing sharply, after a filing showed Keith Gill, the stock influencer known as “Roaring Kitty”, had picked up a 6.6% stake in the pet products e-retailer.

The Guardian,https://www.theguardian.com/business/article/2024/jul/01/french-markets-marine-le-pen-euro-dollar,2024-07-01,12:21:48 UTC,French market leaps amid hopes Le Pen will fall short of outright victory,"Shares on the French stock market have risen after the first round of voting in the country’s parliamentary election eased concerns about an outright victory for the rightwing National Rally (RN) party.

The euro rose against the dollar, while the risk premium investors demand for holding French government bonds fell as the markets took the view that the result could have been worse.

But despite a 1.5% jump in France’s benchmark stock market measure – the Cac 40 – on Monday, shares have fallen 5% in the past month amid fears that Marine Le Pen’s RN could still emerge from next Sunday’s second round of voting with an overall majority.

RN secured 33% of the vote, while the leftwing New Popular Front secured 28% and Emmanuel Macron’s centrist bloc won the support of 20% of those who voted.

Alex Everett, an investment manager at the fund management company abrdn, said: “We are not out of the woods yet. The National Rally exceeded expectations and may yet pick up the second-round votes for a relative or even absolute majority.

“Intense horse trading until Tuesday evening will likely see deals cut between the left and centre parties to try to derail this.”

On Friday, the gap between the interest rate (yield) on French and German bonds had widened to its highest since the eurozone debt crisis in 2012, but the spread narrowed slightly from 0.85 percentage points to 0.75 points after the results came in. The gap was less than 0.5 points before the snap election was called.

Krishna Guha, an analyst at the US investment bank Evercore, said: “The vote is far from definitive but leans in favour of the less bad scenario of a hung parliament, political paralysis in Paris and chronic dysfunction at the EU level rather than the worse scenarios of an outright win for the far right or far left that might directly lead to a new European sovereign crisis.”

Newsflash: The Bank of England has warned that financial markets remain at risk of a sharp correction.

In its latest financial stability report, the BoE says that high inflation, or geopolitical risks, could trigger a selloff.

The Bank says risks to the UK financial system are “broadly unchanged” since the first quarter of the year.

But some asset prices have continued to rise, it points out, while the risk of a sharp correction persists.

European markets are up around 8% so far this year, while the US Nasdaq Composite index has surged by 18%.

The report, which is designed to track the stability of the financial system, says:

The prices of many assets such as shares and bonds remain high relative to historical norms, and some have continued to rise. This suggests that investors in financial markets are continuing to expect the economy to recover and inflation to fall. They are placing less weight on risks, such as geopolitical developments or continued high inflation, that might cause weaker growth or interest rates to stay higher than expected. These risks make it more likely that there could be a sharp correction in asset prices that could ultimately make it more costly and difficult for UK households and businesses to borrow.

The Guardian,https://www.theguardian.com/business/article/2024/jun/26/human-rights-group-fca-shein-lse-flotation-uyghurs,2024-06-26,16:11:48 UTC,Human rights group urges UK financial regulator to block Shein’s LSE flotation,"A human rights group has urged Britain’s financial regulator to block the Chinese fast-fashion retailer Shein’s planned blockbuster flotation on the London Stock Exchange.

Stop Uyghur Genocide, a UK-based human rights charity that alleges minority Uyghur people are being used as forced labour at some of Shein’s cotton suppliers in China’s north-western Xinjiang region, has begun a legal campaign against the planned stock market listing.

Represented by the law firm Leigh Day, the campaign group has written to the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) to argue that “any attempt by Shein to list on the LSE should be refused”.

The China-founded company, which was valued at $66bn (£52bn) in a fundraising round last year, began to explore a listing on the LSE early this year, and is expected to file a prospectus with the UK regulator soon. Shein abandoned its original plan to list in New York after opposition from US politicians.

On Tuesday, Amnesty International UK said Shein’s potential London listing would be a “badge of shame” for the London market because of the fast-fashion firm’s “questionable” labour and human rights standards.

The fast-fashion retailer said on Wednesday: “Shein has a zero-tolerance policy for forced labour and we are committed to respecting human rights. We take visibility across our entire supply chain seriously and we require our contract manufacturers to only source cotton from approved regions.”

Stop Uyghur Genocide said it had reminded the FCA that its US counterpart, the Securities and Exchange Commission, has already refused to recommend the listing of Shein for trading on the US stock exchange because of concerns around labour practices in the company’s supply chains.

The group said the London listing should not be allowed to go ahead because the UK has signed up to International Labour Organization conventions, which set out minimum standards for engaging workers. Any concerns about companies engaging workers in their supply chains that may breach those minimum standards are inconsistent with the UK’s convention obligations, it said.

“The FCA has a statutory duty of integrity and to protect its investors,” the group added.

The Leigh Day solicitor Ricardo Gama, who represents Stop Uyghur Genocide, said: “Stop Uyghur Genocide expects UK financial institutions to uphold the high ethical standards that they pay lip service to, and to make clear that London isn’t the place to come for a ‘no questions asked’ approach to capital. At the very minimum regulators must make sure that laws in place to root out modern slavery are complied with.”

Stop Uyghur Genocide said it was concerned about the London Stock Exchange’s ability to detect and respond to any alleged forced labour in Shein’s supply chains.

Stop Uyghur Genocide is preparing a detailed submission to the regulator to support its letter.

In the meantime, the campaign group’s lawyers have asked the FCA to obtain more information from Shein about the “accuracy of its published modern slavery statement”.



Under the Modern Slavery Act, large businesses have to publish a statement every year that sets out the measures they have taken to ensure slavery and trafficking do not occur in their own operations and their supply chains.

Leigh Day lawyers have urged the regulator to “refuse Shein’s listing application unless the FCA is satisfied that its products are not tainted by forced labour”.

Rahima Mahmut, executive director of Stop Uyghur Genocide, said she was “deeply concerned” about Shein’s potential London listing and said the organisation had been highlighting concerns from national security and human rights experts that Shein “could be associated with egregious human rights abuses, including modern slavery, and pose ethical and security risks to businesses and citizens”.

“Our investment community must not support companies like Shein who are reportedly linked to the Chinese state and which we believe may enable the ongoing genocidal policies against Uyghurs.”

The FCA declined to comment on Shein’s potential listing. It noted that it has no investigation or enforcement powers relating to alleged breaches of legislation not within its remit, such as the Modern Slavery Act or tax legislation.

Before a company’s shares can be admitted to the LSE, the firm must apply to the FCA for admission to listing and to approve its prospectus. The watchdog said it was the company’s responsibility to ensure the information in its prospectus is accurate, and not the FCA’s role to independently verify the accurate of information.

Michael Polak, barrister and chair of Lawyers for Uyghur Rights, said: “A firm alleged to have involvement in goods directly produced by slave labour in the Uyghur region creates a risk that those vital principles will be violated. We will ask the FCA to consider the expert evidence that we will provide to them before deciding on a public listing in the UK.”","A human rights group has urged Britain’s financial regulator to block the Chinese fast-fashion retailer Shein’s planned blockbuster flotation on the London Stock Exchange.

LGIM warns this morning that it believes companies need to do more to play their part in efforts to mitigate climate change risks. UPDATE: It will divest Glencore shares held in its Future World fund range, LGIM’s ESG fund ranges, and all defined contribution (DC) auto-enrolment default funds in L&G Workplace Pensions and the L&G Mastertrust. The decision applies to funds covering around £176bn in assets under management. Glencore, which is the world’s biggest coal shipper, is “phasing down” its coal portfolio, as part of a plan to only achieve net zero emissions by the middle of the century. That means some existing coalmines would run until 2050, despite concerns about the pollution caused by thermal coal. ‘Largest ever’ NSW coalmine plan will put pressure on state’s net zero target, watchdog says Read more Legal & General says: “LGIM remains concerned that Glencore has not disclosed plans for thermal coal production that are aligned with a net zero pathway.” LGIM are the 22nd largest Glencore investor overall, according to data from LSEG, with 0.44% of the company’s shares.

6d ago 16.42 CEST Back in the UK, the Czech billionaire hoping to buy Royal Mail has confirmed he is considering offering employees a stake in the business, as his company asked shareholders to back its £3.6 billion takeover bid. As flagged this morning, Daniel Kretinsky’s EP Group set out its plans for the future of Royal Mail’s owner, International Distribution Services (IDS), in a letter sent to shareholders. In the offer letter, EP Group said it is “exploring, following completion of the acquisition, potentially offering a form of employee participation model in the business” which could include “profit-sharing” among all members of staff. Unions representing postal workers have previously called for staff to be given a stake in the company via a shake-up of its structure. Share

6d ago 16.25 CEST US new home sales fell in May Sales of new US single-family homes dropped to a six-month low last month,new data from the Commerce Department shows. New home sales declined 11.3% to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 619,000 units last month, the lowest level since November. This indicates that high mortgage rates are hurting demand, weakening the housing market. April’s sales data was revised higher, though, to show 698,000 units were sold (on an annualised basis), not the 634,000 units first reported. US New Home Sales Crashed In May

6d ago 15.36 CEST Rivian shares jump after Volkswagen agrees to $5bn investment Over on Wall Street, shares in Rivian have surged after Volkswagen agreed to invest up to $5bn in the Amazon-backed electric carmaker. Volkswagen will initially invest $1bn as part of a partnership with Rivian to form a new, equally controlled joint venture to share electric vehicle architecture and software, the companies said on Tuesday. The deal is a significant win for Rivian, which is grappling with steep losses as it attempts to ramp up production of its electric trucks and sport utility vehicles. While EV startups have been dealing with a slowdown in demand amid high interest rates and dwindling cash, traditional automakers have struggled to build battery-powered vehicles and advanced software. Shares in Rivian’s stock have jumped by 30% in early New York trading, from $11.96 to $15.47, following yesterday’s announcement.

6d ago 15.08 CEST Looking at the European economy, S&P Global says activity in the eurozone is on the rise, with the May composite purchasing managers’ indices firmly above the expansion threshold. Today’s report says: The eurozone has exited the recent manufacturing recession, putting it cyclically ahead of the U.S. Meanwhile, the labor market continues to slow although the unemployment rate remains near all-time lows. Southern Europe (Spain and Italy) continues to outperform Northern Europe (Germany) not only due to a prevalence of services, but also a rise in productivity in the case of Spain. Recent slower growth at the eurozone level reflects in part a faster passthrough of monetary policy, which has led to weaker inflation pressures. Share

6d ago 14.56 CEST S&P Global have raised their forecast for the UK economy this year. They now expect UK GDP to rise by 0.6% this year, up from a previous forecast of 0.3%. Chief economist Paul Gruenwald says “the recovery in services in the first quarter has been stronger than expected” in the UK. However, the UK growth forecast in 2025 has been trimmed to 1.2%, from 1.4%. Spain’s growth forecast has also been revised up, to 2.2% in 2024 from 1.8%. This is to reflect “robust household balance sheets and rapid disinflation”, Gruenwald explains. Share

6d ago 14.35 CEST S&P Global: soft-landing narrative remains valid The global economy remain on track for a soft landing, as central banks start to lower interest rates followin recent falls in inflation. So says credit rating agency S&P Global, in its latest global economic update. S&P Global is still optimistic that policymakers will pull off a ‘soft landing’ – bringing down inflation without triggering a recession. It explains: GDP growth has moderated in most economies (the U.S. remains an outlier) and recessions have been avoided. Demand pressures have come down, bringing inflation back toward target. Services demand and employment remain robust, moderating the speed of decline, and bolstering the probability of a soft landing. S&P Global argues that central banks have reached “the beginning of the end-game”, as some – such as the Bank of Canada, the Swiss National Bank and the European Central Bank – have recently started cutting interest rates in response to falling inflation. Although inflation has been stickier than hoped, S&P Global argues this is “just the flipside” of resilient spending and strong jobs markets, and compatible with a soft landing. They say: A recession with a sharp drop in employment and labor demand would likely produce a faster decline in inflation, but is that what we really want? Share

6d ago 14.32 CEST Dominic Chappell must repay £50m over BHS collapse Back in the UK retail sector, the former head of BHS is digesting a court ruling that he must pay at least £50m to cover losses racked up before its collapse. Yeterday, a judge found that Dominic Chappell had sought to “plunder” the UK department store chain, which collapsed in 2016. Mr Justice Leech said Chappell had agreed to purchase BHS without “any prospect” of obtaining working capital to meet its day-to-day financial needs. He then took the “opportunity to plunder the BHS Group as and when he could”, the judge explained. The Financial Times has more details: At a hearing on Tuesday, the judge said Chappell “should make the payments” set out in a draft order. A copy of the order, seen by the Financial Times, shows the sums include £21.5m for a wrongful trading claim, £17.5m for breach of fiduciary duty, plus costs and interest, totalling at least £50m. Back in 2020, Chappell was been sentenced to six years in jail for evading tax on the £2.2m income he received from his doomed takeover of BHS.

6d ago 13.53 CEST Bloomberg points out that Glencore’s coal business has long been a source of controversy among climate activists and some investors. In an article about LGIM’s divestment plans, they explain: In 2020, Norway’s sovereign wealth fund said it had sold its Glencore stake due to the company’s exposure to thermal coal. Glencore plans to consult with shareholders on the future of the coal business once it completes the acquisition of Teck Resources Ltd.’s steelmaking coal unit. Should a majority of investors show support to spin off the unit, Glencore will hold a vote on separating it. More here. Share

Overall, those funds have around £176bn in assets under management. But LGIM is not divesting their entire position in Glencore. LGIM explains: Climate Impact Pledge divestments are used to signal not only to the companies, but the wider sector and market, that there has been insufficient progress made in mitigating climate change risks. LGIM continues to engage with companies on its divestment list and will take companies off the list when sufficient progress is made. Share Updated at 12.58 CEST

6d ago 12.05 CEST CBI: UK retail sales go into reverse Just in: UK retail sales have fallen faster than expected this month, as the sector went into reverse after May’s modest recovery. The CBI’s latest healthcheck on UK retailers, just released, found that retail sales volumes fell in the year to June, following a modest recovery in May. The CBI’s retail sales volume gauge fell to -24% this month, from +8% in May, showing that a majority of retailers reported a drop in volumes compared to the previous year.

Sales were reported to be below “average” for the time of year. Sales volumes are expected to remain below seasonal norms in July, albeit to a lesser extent. #DTS pic.twitter.com/RhJ7ohmOgj — CBI Economics (@CBI_Economics) June 26, 2024 The CBI explains: Sales were reported to be well below “average” for the time of year (-39% from +2% in May). Sales volumes are expected to remain below seasonal norms in July, albeit to a lesser extent (-29%).

Orders placed upon suppliers fell moderately in the year to June at a broadly similar pace to last month (-14% from -11% in May). Retailers expect the cutback in orders to continue next month (-16%). Alpesh Paleja, CBI interim deputy chief economist, says: “Last month’s nascent recovery in sales proved to be short-lived, with retailers reporting a faster-than-anticipated decline this month. Unseasonably cold weather in June may have played a role, but it’s notable that internet retail sales fell sharply in our survey, too. Consumer fundamentals are improving, with inflation now at the Bank of England’s 2% target and real incomes rising. But it’s clear that households are still struggling with the legacies of the cost-of-living crisis, with the level of prices still historically high in some areas. With consumer demand still on shaky ground, an incoming government can help business by ensuring that the UK is the most attractive place to start, grow and run a business. This will require bold action such as delivering a holistic cross-economy solution to the UK’s overly complex business rates system, which is a particular burden for retailers. This would help to alleviate the burden of higher costs.” Share

6d ago 11.34 CEST LGIM will also divest from TJX Legal & General Investment Management has also decided to divest its stake in US retail chain TJX, the parent company of UK chain TK Maxx. LGIM says TJX, like Glencore, failed to sufficiently address concerns raised in recent years about its environmental impact. LGIM says it concerned over TJX’s lack of a zero-deforestation policy and insufficient disclosure of “material Scope 3 emissions” that fail to account for its material value chains’ emissions. Today’s decisions will raise the number of divestments through LGIM’s Climate Impact Pledge to 16. LGIM says this “stewardship” of its investments is a critical lever in the global push to reach net zero. Stephen Beer, senior manager sustainability and responsible investment at Legal & General Investment Management, adds: We find that as time progresses, our conversations with companies can become harder-edged; not necessarily more difficult, but more focused. We use tools such as voting and divestment to encourage companies to meet our expectations on net-zero, while also sending a clear signal to the wider market. While divestment is one of the many stewardship tools we use as a mechanism for driving change, we see it as a last resort and by no means the last stage of engagement. Our engagement will continue, and where companies make sufficient progress, they will be reinstated. Ultimately, whilst we are focused on a net-zero objective, there is no one size fits all approach; our engagement approach is nuanced, it is about listening to companies and understanding the challenges they face, as well as the potential opportunities ahead, in accelerating the pace of the transition at a global scale.” Share","Share6d ago 14.56 CEST S&P Global have raised their forecast for the UK economy this year.

It is the story of how Europe and Russia remain locked in a tense relationship of economic dependence, even as they supposedly cut their ties. It is the story of the uncomfortable truth behind why the cost of living crisis came to an end.

But before all of that, it is the story of a ship - a very unusual ship indeed.

If you ever spot the Yakov Gakkel as it sails through the English Channel or the Irish Sea (I first set eyes on it in the Channel but at the time of writing it was sailing northwards, about 20 miles off the coast of Anglesey) you might not find it all that remarkable.

At first glance it looks like many of the other large, nondescript tankers and cargo vessels passing these shores. Its profile is dominated by an enormous blue prow which reaches high out of the water and ends, 50 metres further back, at its unexpectedly angular stern.

Yet the ship's slightly odd shape - all hull and barely any deck - is the first clue about what makes the Yakov Gakkel so special. Because this is one of the world's most advanced liquefied natural gas (LNG) tankers, with an unusual trick up its sleeve.

LNG tankers are extraordinary ships, with insides so cleverly engineered they are capable of holding vast amounts of natural gas at temperatures of approximately −163C.

For all that the world is embracing renewable energy, natural gas remains one of the most important energy sources, essential for much of Europe's heating and power, not to mention its industries. For the time being, there is no cheap way of making many industrial products, from glass and paper to critical chemicals and fertilisers, without gas.

Once upon a time, moving natural gas from one part of the world to another necessitated sending it down long, expensive, vulnerable pipelines, meaning only countries with a physical connection to gas producers could receive this vital fuel. But LNG tankers like the Yakov Gakkel are part of the answer to this problem, since they allow gas producers to send it by sea to anywhere with a terminal capable of turning their supercooled methane back into the gas we use to heat our homes and power our grids.

But the Yakov Gakkel can also do something most other LNG tankers cannot, for that enormous blue double hull allows it to carve through ice, enabling it to travel up into the Arctic Circle and back even in the depths of winter.

And that is precisely what this ship does, more or less constantly: travelling back and forth between Siberia and Europe, through winter and summer, bringing copious volumes of gas from Russia to Europe. It is part of the explanation for how Europe never ran out of gas, even after the Russian invasion of Ukraine.

This is not, it's worth saying, the conventional wisdom. Back when Russia invaded Ukraine, European policymakers declared they planned to eliminate the continent's reliance on Russian gas - which accounted for roughly a third of their supplies before 2022.

And many assumed that had already happened - especially after the Nord Stream pipeline, the single biggest source of European gas imports, was sabotaged in late 2022. But while volumes of Russian pipeline gas into Europe have dropped dramatically, the amount of Russian LNG coming into Europe has risen to record levels.

Russia helps Europe replenish gas stores

Today, Europe still depends on Russia for around 15% of its gas, an ever-growing proportion of which now comes in via the sealanes, on tankers like the Yakov Gakkel. And while the US has stepped in to make up some of the volumes lost when those pipelines stopped, only last month Russia overtook the US to become the second biggest provider of gas to the continent. It's further evidence that those LNG volumes carried on ships through the North Sea, the Irish Sea and the English Channel, are increasing, rather than falling.

This Russian gas has helped Europe replenish its gas stores, it has helped keep the continent's heavy industry going throughout the Ukraine war. And this dependence has not come cheap: the total amount Europe has paid Russia for LNG since 2022 comes to around €10bn.

'Sanctions failed to achieve goals,' says Russia's ambassador

The continued presence of Russian gas running through European grids is at least part of the explanation for why European energy prices have fallen so sharply since those post-invasion highs. Back then, many in the market were pricing in a complete end of Russian gas supply to Europe - something that would have had disastrous consequences. But it never actually happened.

Perhaps this explains why the continent's politicians have, so far, stopped short of banning imports of Russian gas: they are aware that their economy would struggle to withstand another sharp spike in inflation - which would almost certainly eventuate if it stopped taking Russian gas altogether.

Image: Russian gas has helped keep Europe's heavy industry going throughout the Ukraine war

This week, European leaders agreed to stop allowing Russia to use its ports to ""trans-ship"" its LNG - essentially acting as a stop-off point towards other destinations. However, those transshipments account for only a fraction - at most a quarter - of the Russian gas coming in on tankers to Europe. The vast majority ends up in Belgium, France and Spain, heating European homes, fuelling power stations and powering machinery in factories.

While European leaders have imposed wide-ranging sanctions and price caps on shipments of oil, no such controls exist for liquefied natural gas. So the Yakov Gakkel and a fleet of LNG tankers carry on sailing between Siberia and various ports in Europe - Zeebrugge, Dunkirk, Montoir and Bilbao - keeping the continent supplied with the Russian hydrocarbons it still cannot live without.

British firm's role in lucrative trade

But there is another reason why this ship is particularly unique, for the Yakov Gakkel - this critical cog in the financial machine that helps finance the Russian regime - is actually part-owned and operated by a British company.

That brings us back to a street overlooking the Clyde in Glasgow, where, in a glass-fronted office block, you will find the operational headquarters of a company called Seapeak. The chances are you haven't heard of Seapeak before, but this business owns and operates a fleet of LNG tankers all across the world.

That fleet includes the Yakov Gakkel and four other LNG icebreakers that ply this Siberian trade. That a British company might be facilitating this lucrative trade for Russia might come as a surprise, but there is nothing illegal about this: the sanctions regime on Russia just turns out to be significantly more porous than you might have thought.

We tried repeatedly to speak to Seapeak - to ask them about the Yakov Gakkel and whether they felt it was appropriate - given the UK has forsworn LNG imports - that a British company and British workers are helping administer this Russian trade. We sent emails with questions. However, they did not respond to our calls or our emails.

When, after weeks of efforts to get a response, I visited their offices in Glasgow, I was met by a security guard who told me Seapeak would not see me without an appointment (which they were refusing to give me). Eventually I was told that if I would not leave they would call the police.

Image: A security guard at Seapeak's offices in Glasgow said no one was available to speak to Sky News

Seapeak is not the only British company helping keep Russian gas flowing. While British insurers are banned from protecting oil tankers carrying Russian crude, there's no equivalent sanction on Russian LNG ships, with the upshot that many of these tankers are insured by British companies operating out of the Square Mile.

We spent some time tracking another icebreaking tanker, the Vladimir Rusanov, as it approached Zeebrugge. It is insured by the UK P&I Club, which also insures a number of other LNG carriers.

In a statement, it said: ""The UK Club takes great care to observe all applicable sanctions regulations in relation to Russian energy cargoes, but the direct carriage of LNG from Yamal to Zeebrugge, and provision of insurance services for such carriage, is not presently sanctioned. If the EU and G7 nations were to change their policy… the Club would of course comply by adjusting or withdrawing its services, as necessary.""

Image: The Vladimir Rusanov off the coast of Zeebrugge

The transport of Russian gas into Europe - its dependence on British operators and insurers - is only one small example of the loopholes and omissions in the UK sanctions regime. But while government ministers have expressed concern about the effectiveness of the broader sanctions regime, there is still scant evidence they intend to tighten up this corner of it.

Before the election was called the Treasury Select Committee was in the middle of collecting evidence for its own inquiry into the regime, which was expected to focus on insurers of vessels taking Russian goods. However, the inquiry was wound up prematurely when the election was called in May.

In the meantime, ships like the Yakov Gakkel carry on taking billions of cubic metres of gas from the gas fields of Yamal in Siberia down to Europe, in exchange for billions of euros. And those and other hydrocarbon revenues are one of the main explanations for how Russia is able to produce more missiles and weapons than the Ukrainians.

So Europe carries on fuelling its industry and its power and heating grids with molecules of gas coming from Siberian gasfields, while assuring itself it's doing everything it can to fight Vladimir Putin.

It is, in short, a discomforting situation. But given the alternative is to induce another cost of living crisis, there is little appetite in Europe to change things.","Because this is one of the world's most advanced liquefied natural gas (LNG) tankers, with an unusual trick up its sleeve.

Andrei Kelin was speaking to Sky News as an investigation by Sky's Ed Conway revealed glaring loopholes in the restrictions regime, which has allowed British companies - legally - to help keep Russian gas flowing and generate huge revenues for the Kremlin's war machine.

He defended the continued trade with Europe despite the heightened tensions, arguing ""business is pure business"".

He also argued the supply of weapons by the West, including Britain, to Ukraine was ""bad"", as it perpetuated the conflict, which he claimed would be worse for Kyiv in the long-term.

Speaking to The World With Yalda Hakim programme, Mr Kelin said: ""The goal of the sanctions was first of all to spoil (the) normal life of Russians so they will say that (Vladimir) Putin is wrong.

""The second point of sanctions was to damage the Russian economy as much as possible.

""The third point was to change the political personnel.

""So none of these goals have been reached by the sanctions.""

However, Mr Kelin played down the importance to Russia of the trade.

He said: ""It's just a small portion of the budget, which is measured now in trillions of whatever it is - euros, dollars, pounds, roubles - the budget is big.""

He added: ""We're not so greedy as Europe. There is no ideology in it.

""Why not if they are buying it?

The AA declared on Tuesday that a 10-week run of falling pump prices had come to an end.

The motoring group said while average costs were still locked at levels seen last week, a growing number of forecourts were imposing hikes to pump costs due to higher oil and wholesale charges.

Its rival, the RAC, said in a separate study that prices for both petrol and diesel remained ""too expensive"", accusing retailers in England, Scotland and Wales of giving their customers a ""raw deal"" based on wholesale trends.

Starmer incredulous over latest Tory attack line

Petrol should be an average 4.5p a litre lower across the three nations, its report stated, while diesel should be 8p less.

Independent retailers have long denied the RAC's claims of profiteering, claiming its criticism takes no account of the industry's increased costs for things such as wages and electricity.

There is currently a voluntary fuel price transparency scheme in place operated by the Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) after it found drivers were overcharged by supermarkets in 2022 to the tune of £900m.

A statutory Pumpwatch scheme is expected to replace it later this year, forcing forecourts to divulge their costs.

The initiative, which is modelled on an existing price comparison service used in Northern Ireland and credited with bolstering competition, could also result in the regulator being given powers to fine rip-off fuel providers.

The final make-up will be determined by whoever forms the next government after Thursday's general election.

The CMA's transparency scheme showed average petrol costs at 144.5p and diesel at 149.6p on Monday.

AA fuel price spokesman Luke Bosdet said: ""The question is whether, after a significant fall in the UK's average petrol price in June, the price will repeat last year's sharp rise going further into the summer.

""It would be a blow for the impending summer getaway if the cost of road travel took off again.

""For now, filling up sooner rather later will take advantage of current lower prices. Statutory fuel price transparency coming into force later this year will therefore be a big boost for drivers facing this type of market movement in the future.

""At present, the scheme has revealed some upheaval in old patterns of fuel retailing, such as Asda offering supermarket pump prices at some non-supermarket forecourts where it has a retail presence and the independent chain Motor Fuel Group providing cheap fuel on former Morrison supermarket forecourts.""

Supermarkets had historically been the market leaders in fuel price costs, often offering discounts on top to lure shoppers to their stores.

This ended during the cost of living crisis as chains invested instead in dropping prices for household essentials.

The RAC report claimed that UK wholesale fuel costs did not justify the average prices still being charged outside Northern Ireland.

It said that there were vast differences between average costs at supermarket pumps and that Shell and BP-branded sites tended to charge the most.

RAC head of policy Simon Williams said: ""We will continue to highlight this disparity, along with the massive differences between major retailers' high and low prices, to the new government and the Competition and Markets Authority with a view to them being addressed by the new Pumpwatch scheme when it is up and running.""

LSEG data on Tuesday showed Brent crude oil, the international benchmark, trading above $87 a barrel - levels last seen at the end of April.

Global oil costs have been rising steadily since early June.

Some of the increases can be attributed to rolling production cuts by major oil-producing nations in the OPEC+ cartel, which includes Saudi Arabia and Russia.

The conflict in the Middle East, disruption to shipping in the Red Sea and forecasts of rising demand in China have also weighed.

Expectations of a 5% lift in drivers using America's roads during the peak summer holiday season were helping drive the price higher on Tuesday, according to market analysts.

Hani Abuagla, senior market analyst at XTB MENA, added: ""Furthermore, Hurricane Beryl impacted sentiment, posing a threat to oil production if it shifts toward the Gulf of Mexico.

Sky News understands that the Tories are planning to publish a letter signed by between 100 and 150 SME bosses that will argue that a Labour government would risk damaging their business.

Sources said the letter was expected to be released on Wednesday, the final day before Britain goes to the polls.

Neither the text of the letter nor the names of the signatories were clear on Tuesday.

A business-owner approached to sign it, but who declined, said he was surprised the Tories had not done more to exploit differences between the two main parties on potential capital gains tax changes during the campaign.

One insider described it as ""a last-ditch bid"" to reverse some of the momentum behind Labour, which has published a series of letters during the election campaign backed by businesspeople.

One of those, however, was widely derided for featuring the name of just one FTSE-100 chair or CEO - the JD Sports Fashion chairman Andrew Higginson.

Another focused on proposed reforms of the Apprenticeship Levy.

Letters with the endorsement of business leaders have become a regular feature of UK political campaigns, with the Tories historically able to command significant support from prominent figures.

The absence of such a letter during this campaign has been perceived as a reflection of the party's poor performance in the polls and its recent record in government.

Sky News has learnt that Jefferies, the investment bank, has been hired by Addison Lee's majority shareholder, Cheyne Capital, to canvass interest in a takeover.

The process is thought to be at a relatively early stage and might not lead to a transaction, according to one insider.

Addison Lee's potential valuation in any transaction is unclear.

The company, which transports about seven million people in journeys in the capital each year, was sold to Cheyne Capital's Strategic Value Credit arm and Liam Griffin, son of founder John, in 2020.

That deal came after a tussle for control involving Addison Lee's syndicate of lenders.

The elder Mr Griffin founded the business in 1975, and it became a ubiquitous presence on London's roads.

In an eight-part series for Sky News' Money blog, our reporter Jess Sharp speaks to women who are bossing it in their respective fields - hearing their stories, struggles and advice for those who want to follow in their footsteps.

This week, she has spoken to Kelly McCabe, the co-founder of the UK's first virtual cancer care clinic Perci Health...

When Kelly and her co-founder Morgan Fitzsimons set up their business, they made an unusual decision - they sat down and planned when they'd both have children.

It's a topic many men will never feel the need to discuss with their business partners, but as two women, it was something they realistically needed to think about.

""We had a long conversation and made a decision that we would have children at different times so that one person would stay in the business to allow the other to take the time out they needed,"" Kelly said.

""Of course, you can't plan this thing perfectly, but we were fortunate enough that it kind of happened that way.""

Morgan was the first to have her baby and returned to work after a couple of months off, and Kelly gave birth six months later.

A month after having her now nearly two-year-old son, Kelly returned to work and Perci Health has continued to grow ever since.

'Whether it was NHS or private care - I saw the same problem'

Despite Perci Health being a virtual care clinic, Kelly's career background had nothing to do with app development - she started out in the NHS.

One of the roles she had was helping people with cancer eat and drink while receiving treatment.

Working mostly with people with head and neck cancer, she supported them with tube feeding and their rehabilitation back to solid foods.

After working in a similar area in private healthcare, she realised all cancer patients were experiencing the same problem.

""There was a universal experience at the end of treatment where you would have your final review with your cancer nurse or oncologist, and they would say 'see you again in six months or 12 months time',"" Kelly said.

""Patients would come back into our follow-up clinics with all sorts of problems they had been living with for six months or 12 months and no one was really managing them.

""They had just be grinning and bearing it, thinking it was just par for the course after having cancer.""

She decided to come up with an idea that would connect people living with cancer with professionals who could provide long-term support and optimise their wellbeing.

Male investors in a male-bias sector

With a plan in mind, she reached out to her friend Morgan, who had a background in digital marketing, and the pair got started working weekends and evenings to build their company.

When COVID hit, they made the decision to ""just go for it"", quit their jobs and put all their focus on the business.

Their first round of funding came from family and friends, raising £500,000, which gave them enough to pay themselves a reduced salary and hire a small team.

But more funding was needed, and they started reaching out to investors.

With Kelly's clinical experience, the issue she was trying to solve in the health care sector seemed ""obvious"", but the first hurdle she faced was convincing others that it was ""important enough to solve"".

""The challenges seemed very obvious to us, but they might not necessarily be obvious to investors, and I think that is particularly true if you're solving a problem that affects women,"" she said.

""I'm really sad to say that it's kind of the old-fashioned things you think of, like a lot of them sell on the golf course or over lunch or going shooting, and we don't get invited to golf or to shoot.

""You don't get many female-owned technology businesses, so that was a barrier.""

Pregnant, pitching and spotting red flags

While meeting potential investors, Kelly was heavily pregnant and was ""nervous"" to explain her situation out of fear it would put them off investing.

""When I had my first conversation with our now lead investor, I was 38 weeks pregnant, so we just did all the conversations on Zoom,"" she said.

""She called and said 'we'd like to invite you in to meet the team and do a formal pitch. Can you do it next week?' and obviously I had to tell her I was heavily pregnant.

""She could tell I was nervous about telling her... but she said she was sorry that I had to explain myself, and we could just delay the pitch.

""We pushed it back about six weeks, but not all investors are that understanding, which is why I was so nervous to explain it.""

Unfortunately, Kelly said she was ""definitely asked"" in the early fundraising rounds if she was planning to have children.

""The feedback from male investments clubs was that women don't know how they feel and may not return to work after having a baby or their motivation to run a business may change,"" she said.

""Early on, we were just looking for investment and we would have taken any partner, but now these are the red flags that we look for.

""There is some definite progress to be made.""

In total, Kelly has raised £5m and still owns 40% of Perci Health.

All the challenges

Away from the challenge of fundraising, Kelly also had to deal with life as a new mum, which brought its own challenges as a business owner.

She explained how having children early in the company's life meant it was still ""relatively fragile"" and there wasn't the chance to take maternity leave knowing her job would be safe when she returned.

""There was a bit of a juggle with that and needing to go back to work very quickly after the baby was born, and then the other challenge is childcare,"" she said.

""You don't want to be taking too much money out of your business and you're rewarded with equity rather than a salary - but of course, equity doesn't pay for childcare.""

Kelly also found there was an ""underestimation"" of her abilities from male investors, and it was something she noticed in the choice of language used to describe her.

""I believe women business owners are underestimated and that is evidenced by the fact that less investment goes to us, but there's research that shows women-owned companies are more profitable,"" she said.

""The language they use is interesting. For example, I'm often described as a conservative CEO within the portfolio because I'm focused on financial preservation... but would my male counterpart be seen as such or would he be seen as having optimal control?""

Kelly's advice

Kelly's top tip is to find a business partner, possibly even two, that can help your business grow.

""Building a business alone would be significantly harder,"" she said.

""Co-founders just help ease the burden when one of you needs to take time out, so find yourself a good business partner.""

She also recommended taking ""a lot of time"" to build a ""strong network"", which she said would help ""protect you as your business grows"".

""There are a lot of female entrepreneurs or female business networks that are great. Morgan and I are members of lots of them,"" she added.

""It's amazing how the amount of advice and support that we have been given for free from other women just wanting to help.""

She said it was important to have a ""really thick skin and to be very persistent"".

""Even in the very best businesses, you get those 100 no's before you get that one yes,"" she added.","This week, she has spoken to Kelly McCabe, the co-founder of the UK's first virtual cancer care clinic Perci Health...

A selective fee-paying school, Hulme is one of around 2,500 independent schools that educate 7% of the school population, a minority that is the target of one of Labour's few unapologetically tax-raising policies.

If elected, Labour says it will end the VAT exemption on fees, making them subject to 20% tax, raising an estimated £1.6bn the party says will be used to hire 6,500 teachers in the state sector that educates 93% of children.

Private school parents fear the increase will be passed on directly, pricing some children out, while industry bodies claim some schools will close.

Oldham is one of the poorest towns in England and Hulme is one of the country's more affordable independent schools, its fees around the national average and well short of the £50,000 charged by Eton and the prime minister's alma mater Winchester College.

Headteacher Tony Oulton, state educated and with experience working on both sides of Britain's educational divide, says Labour's policy misrepresents the majority of private schools and punishes parents.

""The sector is not Eton or Harrow or Winchester, the big posh boarding schools largely based in the south of England.

""The majority is made up of schools like mine where parents are making real sacrifices to pay the school fees because that's how they are choosing to prioritise their spending.""

'They are prioritising education the way some prioritise holidays'

Even without the Labour policy, fees at Hulme will rise 5.5% next year, a figure Mr Oulton says reflects the wider costs pressures, primarily wages for teachers. He says he cannot absorb the VAT rise without sacrificing the 24-child class size limit he believes parents are paying for.

""I lament the political debate, the loss of nuance and insight into the impact on children.

""The idea they are buying privilege and separation would not resonate with parents here. They don't recognise the rhetoric that sits around this, that they are part of some privileged elite. They are prioritising education the way some prioritise holidays.""

Privately educated children do nevertheless enjoy advantages. At £15,000 the average fee is double the £7,500-per-head funding in the state sector, and selection allows independent schools to choose who they want to educate.

Analysis by the Institute for Fiscal Studies meanwhile shows that private school attendance is concentrated among the wealthiest households, with three quarters of pupils drawn from the 30% of highest earners, and most from the top 10%.

This perhaps explains why Labour has felt able to concentrate one of its few openly tax-raising policies on the sector.

It argues that the needs of the state system, relied on by 93% of parents, make it popular while unspoken is the possibility that complaints of those who can afford fees in the first place will elicit little sympathy.

They are relaxed too about warnings that increasing fees will lead to an exodus of pupils that will put state schools under pressure.

Private school rolls have remained constant despite average fees increasing almost 50% in the last decade, and state secondary registers are forecast to fall 7% in the next decade as a population bulge passes through the system.

State education is facing undeniable challenges, including recruitment and retention, with one in four teachers leaving after three years in classrooms.

The growth in demand for special educational needs provision is also putting schools and local authorities under pressure. Some 576,000 children had an active education and health plan in January, almost as many as the total private school roll of around 615,000.

Headlands School in Bridlington faces typical challenges, all while working to clear a £1m deficit from its budget.

Assistant head teacher Adam Woolley said the issues for state education go beyond the school gate.

""It is not just about school funding but funding all the services around young people. A million people are in child poverty so there is only so much schools can do if children come in hungry, cold and without that stable foundation,"" he says.

""I take the argument from private schools and parents that it is a squeeze on people being aspirational for their children, but all parents are aspirational. State schools can and absolutely should be a place where you can send your child and aspire to great things, but that needs funding.""","Private school parents fear the increase will be passed on directly, pricing some children out, while industry bodies claim some schools will close.

It's the discrepancy between perception and reality (and, of course, this can work both ways) that leads to arguments.

Couples who don't divide the housework equally have roughly five arguments about housework each month - rising to eight for couples who rely on just one person for the work.

We spoke to relationship expert Hayley Quinn about the best ways to split household work - and how to deal with arguments should they arise with your partner.

She explained that it's necessary to be ""transparent"" when deciding how to split the workload - but also to be flexible in order to find a solution that suits all involved.

While a 50/50 split might be your idea of perfection, Ms Quinn said it was ""almost inevitable that one partner may take on slightly more of the load"" at different periods of time.

""Striving for perfect 50/50 fairness at all times is a really nice idea, but it just may not be that practical for modern life,"" she said.

She said some jobs may be more visible than others, like cleaning, sorting out the washing and taking the bins out.

Other jobs can take up just as much time and resource but will fly under the radar. She gave examples of sorting out travel insurance or changing over internet provider.

How should you approach a conversation with your partner about splitting the work?

To start off, Ms Quinn said you should enter the conversation with a positive mindset - think how you are both contributing to the relationship in different ways.

""When you're having these conversations, it's not that many people are sitting around feeling like they're not contributing,"" she said.

""In fact, I think if there's a discrepancy in how people contribute, it's just due to a lack of awareness as to what the other partner does, and some chores are just more obviously visible than others.""

Try to avoid starting the chat with the perspective that you are working a lot harder than your partner and they're not pulling their weight.

""That way, you start from a place of we're all on the same team,"" she said.

""When you're doing that as well, it's really important not to make statements which assume what the other partner is thinking, feeling, or contributing.""

Ms Quinn added: ""So, for instance, saying something like 'I'm always the one that's picking the kids up from school and you never do anything', becomes easily very accusational, and this is when arguments start.

""Instead, most partners will be much more receptive if you simply ask for more help and assistance.""

When asking for help, Ms Quinn said it's important to ask in a way that's verbal and clear - don't assume your partner is going to intuitively know what share of household chores to take on if you just complain.

""In a nice way, explicitly ask for what you want. It could be something like saying, 'Look, I know that we're both working a long week, but I feel like there's so much to do. It would be really helpful if... I'd really appreciate it if you take over lunch,'"" she explained.

""Again, start from a place of appreciation. Acknowledge what your partner contributes already, and be explicitly clear as to what you would like them to do. Phrase it as a request for their help.""

She also said some people can feel protective of how jobs are completed, and learning to relinquish that control can be helpful.

""If you want it to feel more equitable, you have to let your partner do things in their own way,"" she said.

What happens if that doesn't work?

If you find the conversations aren't helping, you can always try organising a rota, Ms Quinn said.

She recommended using Starling Bank's Share the Load tool to work out your chore split.

However, she said if you feel there are constant conversations and nothing is changing then the issue is becoming more about communication than sharing the workload.

""It's actually about someone not hearing what you're trying to communicate to them, so it's more of a relationship-wide issue,"" she said.

She advised sitting down and trying to have another transparent verbal conversation, making it clear that you have spoken about this before and how it's making you feel in a factual way, without placing blame.

Using phrases like ""I've noticed"" or ""I've observed"" can help, she said.

If after all that, the situation still isn't getting better, she said it's time to consider confiding in friends or family for support, or seeing a relationship counsellor.","Splitting up household jobs, whether that be cleaning, washing or life admin, is an issue that affects a lot of couples.

It has held the top spot at the box office for the last three weekends, following its release on 14 June.

The Pixar and Walt Disney collaboration is about a young girl called Riley, and the emotions she experiences as she learns and grows (Joy, Sadness, Anger, Fear and Disgust).

Following the success of the first movie, which was released in 2015, the sequel introduces new emotions into the mix - Anxiety, Envy, Ennui and Embarrassment - as Riley becomes a teenager.

The Disney Pixar movie has helped entice the coveted teen demographic (13-17) back into the auditorium.

'Audiences will respond to compelling, entertaining movies'

The voice cast includes Amy Poehler, Maya Hawke and Kensington Tallman, and is directed by Kelsey Mann.

Commenting on the achievement, the president and CEO of the National Association of Theatre Owners Michael O'Leary said: ""On behalf of movie theatre owners across the country and around the world, we want to congratulate Disney's Inside Out 2 for grossing $1bn faster than any animated movie in history.

Article Thesis

Starbucks Corporation (NASDAQ:SBUX) has a strong brand and a successful track record. Recently, its shares got under pressure due to some current growth worries, but as consumer sentiment will improve eventually, so should Starbucks' results.

Past Coverage

I have covered Starbucks Corporation in the past here on Seeking Alpha, most recently in June 2022. In that article, I argued that it had some advantages compared to its peers Dutch Bros Inc. (BROS), although I noted that Dutch Bros offered a better relative growth performance. With two years having passed since that article has been published, it's time for an update on Starbucks.

Starbucks: In The News Due To Unionization

Starbucks Corporation has significant employee costs, as do other restaurant companies. After all, Starbucks employs more than 380,000 people, which naturally results in significant wage costs across its tens of thousands of locations.

Unionization has been a theme when it comes to Starbucks for some time, but the company recently got some additional attention as unionization efforts progressed in Ohio. There are around 10,000 unionized employees at around 400 Starbucks stores across the United States, with additional unionized employees in other countries such as Canada.

Like some other employers, Starbucks Corporation is not a fan of unionization, and the company's former CEO Howard Schulz has even been accused of union-busting.

While increased unionization could result in some cost headwinds for Starbucks, it does not look like the pace of unionization has picked up dramatically in the United States. I thus do not believe that this will be a huge near-term headwind. It is, I believe, more likely that unionization will be a gradual process in parts of the U.S., and Starbucks should ideally be able to offset any related cost headwinds by increasing efficiencies through improving scale while pushing through price increases should also help in keeping its gross margins intact.

Starbucks: Weak Operational Performance In The Recent Past

For many years, it seemed like Starbucks couldn't do anything wrong. The company ran from record results to record results, as we can see in the following chart:

Data by YCharts

Starbucks Corporation saw its sales decline slightly during the Great Recession, and during the initial phase of the pandemic, when lockdowns and a work from home environment made people forego their coffees at Starbucks. But the company recovered quickly from both of these macro headwinds, and sales hit a record high shortly after the pandemic.

The most recent quarter, however, saw Starbucks Corporation report a rare revenue decline. While sales declined by only 1.8%, that was still a pretty bad result compared to the company's past growth trajectory, and considering the fact that inflation still isn't low, the decline was substantially larger in real terms, at around 5% compared to the previous year's quarter.

This time there was no pandemic to cause this problem, and there was no Great Recession, either. Instead, the sales decline was driven by a combination of weak consumer sentiment and competition.

Data by YCharts

In the above chart, we see that consumer sentiment in the United States is rather low, compared to the average over the last decade. This is largely the result of high inflation that has pressured consumers' spending power over the last two years. With weak consumer sentiment and daily expenses running high, some consumers have seemingly decided to forego non-necessary purchases such as out-of-home coffees, other drinks, and food items such as those sold by Starbucks.

Competition also plays a role in the recent rather weak sales performance, as the company's CEO Laxman Narasimhan stated in the most recent earnings call (emphasis by author):

We still see economic volatility in the Middle East, but we remain confident in the region's long-term growth opportunities. In China, we still see the effects of a slower-than-expected recovery, and we see fierce competition among value players in the market, but we are strengthening our premium position and our team in China continues to execute with terrific rigor and heart as the market shakeout continues and as demand recovers and matures.

Later on in the earnings call, the CEO stated:

So let me start with the competition in China. I think the growth that's taking place in the mass area of the China business, of the China overall coffee and tea segment, is one where we see just intense price competition.

So growing competition seems to be a China-specific issue for Starbucks right now, which helps explain why the company's performance in China was weaker compared to the rest of the world. In the United States, Q1 comparable store sales were down 3%, for example, while comparable store sales were down 11% in China over the same time frame.

On one hand, this is good news, as important markets such as the US are better protected from competition -- here, Starbucks still seems to have a very strong moat. On the other hand, China is an important growth market for Starbucks, thus pricing issues in China are a headwind for the company. Starbucks' CEO argued that the competition in China would, sooner or later, make some players leave the market, and Starbucks should be among those remaining once this ""shakeout"" (the CEO's words in the most recent earnings call) has ended.

I thus do not believe that the current problems that Starbucks is experiencing will persist over the long run. Once consumer sentiment in markets such as Europe and the US improves, and once the Chinese market has experienced its ""shakeout,"" comparable store sales should improve again. But it may take some time for this to play out, thus rather weak results for the remainder of the current fiscal year are possible for sure. Analysts expect that Starbucks will report earnings per share decline for the fiscal third quarter and flat earnings per share for the fourth quarter of the current fiscal year, which seems reasonable to me -- a gradual improvement over the coming quarters should result in Starbucks getting back on growth track in fiscal 2025.

So while Starbucks isn't in a great place right now from an operations point of view, the share price slump that the recent results have caused could make for a buying opportunity for someone with a longer-term focus. After all, if earnings are relatively flat this fiscal year, that is not disastrous. And as long as Starbucks gets back to growing its business again in the coming years, there is no long-lasting problem. Analysts are forecasting earnings per share growth of 15%, 13%, and 14%, for fiscal 2025, fiscal 2026, and fiscal 2027, respectively. There is no guarantee that these estimates will be hit, but I believe that there is a solid chance for these estimates to be reasonable. After all, the current issues will hopefully subside soon, and between new store openings, some price increases, and the impact of share repurchases, Starbucks could generate meaningful earnings per share growth over time.

Starbucks: A Buying Opportunity?

Starbucks Corporation has seen its share price decline significantly over the last year -- shares are now down 9% from five years ago and trading around 40% below the all-time high. This would be justified if Starbucks' current problems would persist forever, but as noted above, I believe that there is a good chance that the company will overcome its current growth slowdown.

Data by YCharts

As we can see in the above chart, Starbucks Corporation's share price slump has made its shares pretty inexpensive, at least on a relative basis. Compared to the longer-term median earnings multiples, Starbucks now trades discounted of close to 30%.

We can also look at the company's enterprise value to EBITDA multiple, which accounts for changes in debt usage over time:

Data by YCharts

Similar to what we have seen with the earnings multiple, Starbucks is now trading at a pretty low valuation compared to the historic valuation range. If Starbucks recovers and its share price trades more in line with the historic valuation a year or two from now, shareholders could thus see substantial share price appreciation. Moreover, a 21x earnings multiple does not seem excessive for a long-term compounder like Starbucks.

The fact that the currently rather low valuation makes Starbucks' share repurchases more efficient and dividend reinvestment more powerful is positive as well.

Takeaway

Starbucks Corporation is currently not in a great spot, but its problems should wane as consumer sentiment will eventually improve and since competition in China is experiencing a shakeout. The share price decline has been severe, and Starbucks is now trading well below the historic valuation range. For someone interested in owning a leading coffee play, Starbucks stock could be quite attractive at the current share price and valuation.","Past CoverageI have covered Starbucks Corporation in the past here on Seeking Alpha, most recently in June 2022.

These aren’t good times for electric vehicle [EV] stocks and China’s Li Auto (NASDAQ:LI) is no exception. With a 49% fall year-to-date [YTD], it's actually one of the worst affected in comparison among the five biggest EV stocks by market capitalisation (see chart below). It has also seen a far bigger decline than the 13.1% for the S&P Kensho Electric Vehicles Index.

Top 5 EV Stocks By Market Cap, Price Return, YTD (Source: Seeking Alpha)

A bigger than average fall, though, does raise the question of whether Li Auto might have overcorrected. This question becomes particularly pertinent after the stock jumped by ~7% in yesterday's trading following robust vehicle delivery data for June.

A closer look at the market dynamics and the company reveal that while there are certainly positives to the stock right now, the downside to it is notable too. Both are detailed here in assessing whether or not LI is a Buy right now.

Positives for Li Auto

From China's EV market to Li Auto's deliveries, there are multiple positives supporting the company at present. Here are three of them.

#1. China’s growing EV market: There are ongoing concerns about China’s economy, reflected in the fact that the Shanghai Composite Index (SHCOMP) has gone nowhere YTD even as the S&P 500 (SP500) has touched new highs. However, the EV market is an exception. In 2023, EV registrations grew by 35% year-on-year (YoY). The latest data, for the June 1-23 period, shows that while growth has cooled off, it still stays healthy at 19% YoY. This is particularly favourable for Li Auto, which is China focused, unlike its peers that have greater global exposure.

#2. Insulated from tariff increases: Exposure to big international markets might be great, but it isn't right now as the US and EU slap bigger tariffs on China's EV imports. Following the US's 4x increase in import tariffs on Chinese EV batteries in May, the EU follows suit by raising tariffs on China's EVs by 17.4%-38.1%, over and above an existing 10% car duty. This can impact companies like BYD, for example, which garnered ~27% of its revenues from international sales in 2023, with Europe as one of its target markets, or even others like NIO (NIO) and XPeng (XPEV). But it doesn't affect Li Auto for now. In fact, it doesn’t even impact the company's immediate expansion plans, which target the Middle Eastern and North African markets. This in turn could make the stock better placed among peers in the foreseeable future.

#3. Strong delivery data: The company’s deliveries saw a bounce back recently too. They rose by a robust ~47% YoY in June, the highest increase seen in five months. Li Auto says it has “reclaimed the top spot in sales among China’s emerging new energy auto brands” since the second quarter (Q2 2024). With this number, the deliveries in the quarter are at 108,581, a 25.5% YoY increase. This rise is towards the higher end of the 21.3% to 27.1% growth forecast by the company.

The challenge of slowing financials

However, it’s not all positive for Li Auto. In particular, the competition in the EV sector is forcing price cuts. The company itself slashed prices across models by ~5% in April. This trend in turn can affect its financial outcomes more than it already has so far this year. Here are three ways how:

#1. Sharp revenue drop expected: After a massive 173.5% YoY revenue increase in 2023 in local currency terms, the company already saw a significant softening in growth to 36.4% YoY in Q1 2024. To put this in further context, the growth is much slower than even the 66.3% to 71.3% increase expected by the company. Li Auto anticipates a further winding down in growth to 4.2%-9.4% YoY in Q2 2024. Even for the full year 2024, analysts estimates on Seeking Alpha put the revenue growth figure at 21.5% in USD terms or 22.8% in RMB terms, making it the slowest in the last five years. This is only partly due to the price cuts, though. Even with the latest jump in delivery growth, it’s worth pointing out that at deliveries grew by a far bigger 185% in 2023, presumably due to far more robust demand.

#2. Gross margin softens: While Li Auto’s gross margin at 20.6% in Q1 2024 was almost the same as that in the corresponding quarter of 2023, it has seen a sequential decline from 23.5% in Q4 2023. Normally, this could just be chalked up to a seasonal disparity, except that there's another reason for it right now. And that's lower vehicle margins, which fell to 19.3% in Q1 2024 from 22.7% in Q4 2023, due to lower selling prices. It’s debatable whether the gross margin itself would reduce from here, considering the sharp expected drop in revenue growth in Q2 2024, but gross profit growth can certainly slow down further. In Q1 2024, it already softened to 38% YoY from 213% in 2023.

#3. Back to operating loss: It’s unsurprising that with slowing growth in gross profit, the company swung back into an operating loss after finally becoming profitable through each of the quarters in 2023. With the expected trends in revenue, the operating loss can continue going forward as well.

The market multiples

Li Auto was still profitable on a net basis as of Q1 2024, as the interest and investment income was big enough to negate the impact of the operating loss. However, it can’t be assumed that profits will continue to get powered from this head. Moreover, it’s an unconvincing way to measure a stock’s value when its loss making on an operating basis.

To this extent, instead of considering the forward price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio, here I look at the trailing twelve months [TTM] P/E instead. From this perspective, LI looks good with a ratio of 12.8x, compared to the consumer discretionary sector at 17.35x.

It’s also better placed than the BYD at 20.5x, the only point of comparison among key Chinese EV manufacturers, with the rest being loss making on a TTM basis along with other big EV stocks like Rivian (RIVN) and VinFast Auto (VFS), which are loss making too. That leaves Tesla (TSLA), which at a massive 53.7x, is an outlier EV stock anyway.

What next?

Despite its encouraging market multiples however, I believe the case for Li Auto isn’t strong enough at present. Not even as China’s EV market is still seeing healthy growth and the company has the advantage of insulation from tariff increases by the US and EU compared to peers.

While its latest delivery numbers have picked up, they are still slower than the growth seen in 2023. Additionally, its price cuts can impact revenue growth going forward, which is expected to slow down sharply in Q2 2024 as per the company's own estimates. Revenue growth already came in lower than the company's expectations in Q1 2024. Gross profit growth can slow down as a result of much softer revenue growth and Li Auto could sustain operating losses as well.

While its TTM P/E is competitive compared with the only other profit making Chinese peer, BYD it doesn’t make a convincing enough case for LI given its weakening fundamentals. Right now, I’m going with a Hold rating, which can change if the company shows better than expected revenue growth and becomes profitable on an operating basis again.

After his party’s dismal showing at the recent European elections, French president Emanuel Macron surprisingly called an early poll for the National Assembly, the lower house of Parliament. In Sunday’s first round of voting, candidates competed for the outright majority in one of 577 constituencies. The far-right party of former presidential candidate Marine Le Pen, National Rally (RN), emerged as the strongest political force in the first round, gaining 33.5% of the votes. The newly formed left-wing alliance, Nouveau Front Populaire (NFP), came in second with 28.1% and President Macron’s coalition a distant third with 20.7%.

Second round outcome on knife’s edge

Second round runoff votes will be held on July 7 in constituencies where no candidate was able to secure 50% of the votes. In the run-off, the top candidates who got at least 12.5% of the voters' support in the first round compete again. Usually, this leads to a head-to-head contest, but sometimes a multi-candidate race can ensue.

Based on Sunday’s first round results, the RN is projected to gain 230-280 seats, putting them in reach of an absolute majority of 289 seats. However, such projections should be treated with caution, as they are notoriously unreliable and the outcome of the second round depends much on the specific situation in each constituency.

Gabriel Attal, the prime minister from President Macron’s party, warned that the far-right RN is at the gate of power. He called for moderate parties to work together, i.e., third-placed candidates in run-offs to withdraw to prevent the RN from governing. Other politicians representing an informal coalition against the far-right made similar statements.

What would an RN government mean…?

In addition to its euro-sceptic stance, the trepidation of financial markets towards an RN government also stems from the projected €100bn cost of policies that were laid out for the 2022 presidential election[1]. These included lowering the retirement age, eliminating income tax for citizens under 30, and lowering the value-added tax (VAT) on energy, petrol and essential household goods. More recently, Jordan Bardella, the presumptive prime minister if the RN forms the government, has tried to paint himself as fiscally responsible. He promised to put some of the measures on hold and reign in the budget deficit, but markets don’t quite buy this transformation.

… for European bonds and the euro?

A good indicator for political risk emanating from the election is the spread of French government over German government bonds (bunds) with 10 years maturity. This spread had risen from around 0.5% before the election was called to more than 0.8% on the eve of the polls. The EUR/USD exchange rate is a similar barometer of perceived political risk and usually correlates inversely with the spread (see chart below).

When markets reopened on Monday after the first round, the 10Y France-Bund spread tightened to below 80 basis points and the euro strengthened by 0.4%, suggesting relief at the outcome. Based on the past relationship between the bond spread and the EUR/USD exchange rate, we think that the EUR has more downside in a negative scenario while bond markets have more fully priced an RN majority.

… for French and European equities

French stocks sold off strongly in recent weeks on the prospect of a right-wing euro-sceptic government. On our composite contrarian sentiment indicator for French vs. European equities, an oversold signal was triggered, suggesting that a countermove was becoming more likely (see chart below).

French equities look oversold

Source: Russell Investments, as of 26 June 2024. Negative values in this chart indicate sentiment is oversold, and positive values indicate sentiment is overbought.

On Monday, the CAC40 index rebounded by more than 2% as the first-round outcome seemed to curtail the tail risk of an outright RN majority. Euro area equities excluding France have been much less affected by the political turmoil, but are also off their 2024 highs.

The bottom line

Nothing has been decided in the first round of legislative elections in France. A hung parliament still seems the most likely outcome, but even a small likelihood of an outright majority for the euro-sceptic RN remains uncomfortable for financial markets.

Volatility will stay high until after the second round of voting on 7 July. French stocks and bonds appear to have priced the negative scenario of an RN government, but the euro could have some downside if the RN wins a parliamentary majority.

Almost irrespective of the outcome, Macron’s gamble of calling an early election may misfire by showing that voters have rejected his policies and making France less governable.

Thesis

iShares Russell 2000 ETF (NYSEARCA:IWM) offers an effective way to gain exposure to U.S. small-caps at a time where small-caps appear to be primed for outperformance relative to large-caps.

ETF Overview

IWM is an exchange-traded fund that provides exposure to 2,000 underlying U.S. public small-cap companies. The ETF is passive, attempting to replicate the results of the Russell 2000 Index. The Russell 2000 is market-cap-weighted like the S&P 500 Index.

Price Versus Performance

While it is passive, IWM’s expense ratio is higher than peers at 0.19% (for instance, Vanguard Small-Cap ETF (VB) has an expense ratio of 0.05% and Schwab U.S. Small-Cap ETF (SCHA) has an expense ratio of 0.04%). Those two ETFs follow different indices, which, due to licensing, might explain some of the discrepancy in expenses. While it may not seem like a big deal initially as all three are providing passive exposure to the same thing, U.S. small-cap stocks, the reality is that the performance results (since January 1, 2015) have been very different, with VB leading in terms of absolute (by almost 1.30% annualized) and risk-adjusted performance. I included the SPDR S&P 500 ETF Trust (SPY) for reference (acting as the benchmark).

Jan 2015 - May 2024 (Portfolio Visualizer)

The market return for the ETF may diverge from the Russell 2000 Index, primarily due to the expense ratio, but it’s historically been within 20 basis points annualized. As of June 24, 2024, IWM traded at a 0.02% discount to NAV. IWM is very liquid with a 30-day median bid-ask spread of 0.00%, which compares favorably to 0.02% for SCHA.

Future Results

Overall, it’s hard to say which ETF will outperform in the future; however, based on past results, VB looks to provide the better risk-adjusted returns with the lowest drawdown and greatest absolute return of the three passive U.S. small-cap ETFs mentioned. That said, I wouldn’t immediately rule out IWM. IWM is highly liquid, providing flexibility and optionality. The Russell 2000 Index is the index that many fund managers benchmark themselves against. It is somewhat of the gold standard of small-cap indices, so the added expense may be worth it for some.

Looking at Morningstar data, VB has the highest P/E multiple while delivering the lowest long-term earnings growth. IWM actually provides the lowest P/E multiple and the highest long-term earnings growth. This suggests to me that IWM may outperform SCHA and VB in the future.

Morningstar

Why Small-Caps

With the Fed increasingly considering reducing interest rates, small-caps are an excellent allocation for several reasons. First off, small-caps are more exposed to the economy and should disproportionately benefit from any economic stimulus versus their large-cap peers. Second, small-cap stocks are trading at a huge discount to their large-cap peers. The chart below is through September 2023 (the discount is even larger now given the massive spread in performance between small-caps and large-caps YTD).

Based on data from January 2000 through September 2023. For illustrative purposes only. (Lazard)

Third, small-cap stocks are much more leveraged than their large-cap peers (3.2x net debt-to-EBITDA versus 1.6x for the S&P 500, per Lazard) and almost half of their outstanding debt is floating rate debt, so if interest rates go down, small-cap interest payments go down significantly relative to large-caps.

As of 30 September 2023. (Lazard)

Conclusion

There are now over 3,200 ETFs, which provide a wide assortment of investment options. It is difficult to determine which ones will succeed and which ones will wither away; however, passive ones based on widely followed and well-regarded indices are likely to stick around. Given the drastic undervaluation of small-caps relative to large-caps and the probability of rate cuts in the future, it would be wise to look at possibly adding some small-cap exposure. Doing so passively provides great options, like VB, SCHA, and IWM. IWM provides exposure to the most widely-followed small-cap index, providing a level of comfort and familiarity that VB and SCHA don’t provide. IWM also provides the lowest P/E and highest earnings growth, suggesting a possibility of outperforming its peers. At the same time, VB has provided superior absolute and risk-adjusted returns since 2015. I would carefully consider all options before investing.","posterioriThesisiShares Russell 2000 ETF (NYSEARCA:IWM) offers an effective way to gain exposure to U.S. small-caps at a time where small-caps appear to be primed for outperformance relative to large-caps.

There are no sure things with any investment approach, but generally speaking bank stocks tend to outperform when the company behind them can sustainably generate multiyear revenue per share and tangible book value per share growth in the high single-digits, healthy ROE, and strong customer satisfaction scores (measured by metrics like J.D. Power’s Net Promoter Score).

Unfortunately, OceanFirst (NASDAQ:OCFC) struggles to hit any of those on a consistent basis, and it’s hard to argue for the company’s succeeding in its plan to disrupt Northeastern banking markets without improved metrics.

These shares are up about 17% since my last update, tracking the regional banking sector. Business went more or less as I expected in 2023, but a higher-for-longer rate cycle is putting pressure on the business as OceanFirst hasn’t been able to keep up with deposit costs. While I can argue for a fair value in the low-$20’s by at least some metrics, I’m concerned about the suboptimal ROE (below cost of equity) and it’s tough to recommend the shares without something clearly positive to hang a bullish thesis on beyond a generally better environment for bank stocks in 2025 and beyond.

Credit Risk Seems Well-Contained

One area where I’m not that concerned about OceanFirst is credit quality. Charge-offs are still basically minimal (there was an outlier in Q3’23 due to a large CRE loan), and while non-performing loan totals have been rising (up 19% qoq in the last quarter), the overall credit outlook is pretty sound.

More than 10% of the loan book is in office properties, which demands attention given the stress on commercial office properties, but very little of that is in central business districts, and a fair bit (28%) is in areas like medical offices where the pressures have not been nearly so intense – remote work isn’t really an option for medical professionals. While I doubt the reported 56% weighted average loan-to-value ratio will hold as properties are reappraised, debt service coverage still appears adequate even under stressed scenarios.

I wish the company provided more disclosure around how it has reserved for its office and multifamily loan books, but criticized loans are still low (1.7%) and OceanFirst has a solid track record where credit quality is concerned.

Spread Pressure Remains Significant

One of the less-positive ongoing parts of the OceanFirst story is the bank’s lack of a solid core deposit franchise to help support the business through challenging rate cycles.

Non-interest-bearing deposits still declined 19% year over year on an average balance basis in the first quarter (and another 6% sequentially), and 16% of deposits, OceanFirst is a fair bit below the mid-20%’s level I’d like to see. This isn’t unusual for a bank with OceanFirst’s business model, but it still creates funding challenges; deposit costs rose almost 150bp yoy to over 2.3% and the cumulative interest-bearing deposit beta of 48% is higher than I’d like (though there are banks with worse betas to be sure).

At the same time, OceanFirst has not seen quite the same uplift from loan yields, with an average realized loan yield of 5.46% in the first quarter and a cumulative loan beta of 32%. That negative spread has hit the bank hard, pushing net interest margins from the 3.6%-3.7% range before the rate hike cycle to 2.8% in the last two quarters.

There really isn’t a way to offset that. Non-interest income is a fairly trivial part of the business today (around 10% of revenue), again typical for this sort of bank, and while earning asset growth has been above average (up 3% yoy in the last quarter), it’s not enough to offset the spread pressure.

The good news is that I don’t think the pressures are going to get all that much worse. Deposit costs seem to be stabilizing and relatively soft loan demand means that the bank doesn’t have to pay up to fund loan growth. At the same time, loans are coming onto the books at attractive prices (7.6% for new originations in Q1’24 versus a 5.5% overall average yield), and that should drive healthy spreads in 2025/2026.

Where’s The “Special Sauce”?

The biggest issue I have with OceanFirst at this point is that it largely looks like just another small bank. That will be okay as the operating environment for banks starts to improve later this year, but it doesn’t really point the way to outsized returns for shareholders and the longer-term returns here are nothing special, with a negative 4.7% annualized five-year return (versus a little under 2% for regional banks) and a 5% annualized 10-year return (versus 6.2%).

Management has talked about disrupting markets like Baltimore, Boston, and Washington, DC, but banks like Pinnacle (PNFP) and SouthState (SSB) are targeting some of these same markets, and doing so with more arrows in their quiver (including higher Net Promoter Scores and significant competitive hire-aways from larger banks). While I do think there are meaningful opportunities for small commercial lending in the Northeast, particularly as banks like M&T Bank (MTB) and New York Community Bancorp (NYCB) get more careful on CRE lending, I’m just not seeing evidence in the numbers of OceanFirst doing something remarkably different than its peers.

The Outlook

After what could possibly be a double-digit decline in earnings for FY’24, I expect a sharp rebound in FY’25 and FY’26. A lot of this depends on the pace of Fed rate cuts and the health of the economy, with the former having a major influence on OceanFirst’s spread outlook and the latter having more influence on loan demand and credit quality.

I do expect around 4% to 5% long-term core earnings growth from OceanFirst (from 2023) or around 2% to 3% growth from the last pre-pandemic year (something of a normalized starting point). Those numbers compare to a historical 4% growth rate for tangible book per share and around 2% for revenue per share.

My biggest concern, frankly, is that OCFC has a poor track record of generating returns relative to its cost of capital. Estimating an equity cost of capital for OCFC involves a lot of assumptions, of course, but I’d say something in the 10%-12% is a good starting point and the bank hasn’t generated a double-digit ROE in the last decade. Even if you want to quibble about what the real cost of equity is, or should be, it’s certainly higher than the 7% trailing average ROE of the last five years.

I get to a high-teens fair value with a discounted core earnings approach, and this methodology definitely punishes ROEs below equity cost. It’s also not the only approach I use, as I also find ROTCE-driven P/TBV and P/E to be useful. If OceanFirst can generate a return on tangible common equity of around 10% over the next 12 months (it managed 9.4% in the last quarter), a multiple of almost 1.25x is supportable, driving a fair value in the low $20’s. Likewise, a forward multiple of 10.4x on ’25 earnings is below the long-term norms for the sector (mid-14’s) and still gets me to around $20.

The Bottom Line

Whenever rates fall, OceanFirst should be a beneficiary and that should get repriced into the shares. That could set the stock up for outperformance as investors factor in better spreads in the coming years, but I’m still leery of making this a recommended name. As I said, I just don’t see what is special here and there are other banks out there that offer leverage to the rate cycle and a few other positives, whether that’s in returns, growth drivers, or what have you.","Credit Risk Seems Well-ContainedOne area where I’m not that concerned about OceanFirst is credit quality.

It's been about a year since the craze of generative AI took off, triggering a spike in the share price of semiconductor companies, whose GPUs naturally feed into that market. The most prominent of the two have been Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMD) and NVIDIA Corporation (NVDA), the former being my focus today. While both stocks initially took off, the first half of 2024 hasn't been as favorable to AMD.

AMD vs. NVDA 6M Total Returns (Seeking Alpha)

Of course, this doesn't necessarily say anything about fundamentals. It could just reflect market sentiment. That said, the conventional wisdom seems to be that while Nvidia and AMD are both better chipmakers than Intel Corporation (INTC), Nvidia still beats AMD.

Yet, with a much flatter stock movement, it could even be the case that AMD is attractively priced for what has been a context of rapidly improving fundamentals for both companies. While I covered AMD before and was dismissive, I decided to look at what AMD brings to the table and evaluate it on its own merits, even if it's just #2.

Previously, I considered that AMD was unrealistically valued and that the future of AI was too uncertain to pay that much of a premium. With more up-to-date information on business trends, however, we can see a clearer future for AMD's role in it.

With the current cash flows, trends, and capital allocation, I don't think the $160 is a great entry price, and I'll explain why the stock is just a Hold for now.

Financials

AMD's free cash flow experienced significant growth over the last five years, with a dip in 2023 after 2022, showing signs of their industry's cyclicality.

Author's display of 10K data

This dip was largely driven by slightly less revenue and an uptick in R&D, which makes sense considering the AI opportunity that opened up that year.

Q1 2024 Company Presentation

Q1 Results, meanwhile, showed that revenues are on the rise again. It was only a slight increase, but a substantial amount of this came from their Data Center Segment.

Q1 2024 Company Presentation

This is a $1 billion difference compared to a year prior. It's also a segment that shows an improving margin.

Liabilities (Q1 2024 Form 10Q)

The recent 10-Q shows very little debt, indicating a very lean and healthy balance sheet.

Cash Flow Statement (Q1 2024 Form 10Q)

Meanwhile, proper buybacks on the open market (not those related to stock-based compensation) fell to near-zero year-over-year, which I actually find to be a positive (I'll elaborate later).

AMD's Strong Suits

One interesting pattern that AMD has been touting recently is what preferences consumers are displaying in regard to their data center needs, as this is also where NVDA has seen significant growth.

CFO Jean Hu has been on a tour of multiple investor conferences in the past couple of months. In each of those, she has spoken about where AMD is showing strength. I'll quote her (emphasis added) from the June 2024 NASDAQ Investor Conference about cost savings:

...when you look at the CIOs today, they are facing a lot of challenges. They are limited by power, by space. And also, they are trying to figure out how to adopt AI. So with all those things, the TCO will become really important, when you look at the AMD Solution, we actually can provide the same amount of compute with 40% less servers with our Gen 4 family. What that means is you can cut CapEx by half at the very beginning and the operation cost to operate those servers will be also 40% less, so when you look at the whole TCO, we do think that will help the refresh cycle, right?

At the June BofA Securities Conference, she also elaborated:

...we have been working with our customers, hyperscale enterprise customers for a multiyear roadmap. So, when you think about the kind of decisions they are making and the CapEx they're spending, it got to be multiyear. You've got to plan out not only this generation but future generations.

In summary, throughout these conference calls, she argued that AMD has a role to play in cost reduction for the long term. This necessarily makes it a long-dated sales process, one that requires AMD to win over the CIOs of an organization for big commitments. It's not a fast win, but it is a valuable one that will be long-dated too.

Much of this is owed to AMD's products are being preferred for inferencing. As she put it:

People need to train the model first, then the inference is where they make money.

Moreover, she explained that generative AI isn't just a GPU sale; CPUs have something to offer too:

When you look at the traditional foundational applications, your ERP system, your database and your shopping website, your Meta, Facebook, Instagram, and all those things, you don't need the GPU. The CPU has the best TCO for that kind of foundational traditional applications.

These are important customers and uses that she is describing here, part of our mainstream idea of tech and how it's practically used.

Even on the GPU front, AMD has won the confidence of Microsoft Corporation (MSFT), teaming up with them to provide a competitive cloud product.

Company Website

It is for all of these reasons that I expect AMD will have some level of certainty about its growth going forward, as uncertain as the future around AI still is.

Share-Based Compensation and Buybacks

Another thing we need to consider is how the future looks for share-based compensation and buybacks. I mentioned earlier that I thought it was good the buybacks had declined, a problem I highlighted when I covered NVDA.

Long-term returns on individual shares, whatever is true of the whole company, are hurt when shares are repurchased at a premium. Similarly, they are value-additive when repurchased discounted. A common trend I've seen across tech stocks, whether they are tied to AI hype or not, are buybacks at high multiples and thus fairly low returns on capital.

Author's display of 10K data

As we can see, buybacks didn't really take off until free cash flow did, so we only have a few years to use for our own ""inferencing"" about how AMD will allocate capital going forward. 2022 was a year when free cash flow was about as high as 2021, but the buybacks were far less.

AMD 5Y Price History (Seeking Alpha)

As seen here, 2021 ended on something of a peak and then proceeded to decline through 2022, presenting great buying opportunities.

2022 Average Price Per Share (2022 Form 10K)

The repurchases were more concentrated in the upper end of that decline, with very little ultimately used for the lower price. All of these are lower than the current price, and the sharp reduction in buybacks in 2023 and especially in Q1 2024 seem to show that the company has developed a taste for a good price.

Seeking Alpha

Still, we have to consider the effect of stock-based compensation, or SBC, which has increased every year for the past decade, with 2023's levels rivaling the total free cash flow. Buybacks in this context effectively turn SBC into an operating expense that simply isn't reported as such, but nevertheless is felt through the reality of the cash flows.

Semi Cycles

While some of these segments are growing, some of them are still exposed to the cyclicality that is common to the semiconductor industry.

Q1 2024 Company Presentation

For example, gaming segment revenue declines were almost as much as the data center's gains. In particular, gaming is influenced by the cycle of its new consoles, and things are at a bit of a lull, particularly as this is non-essential and doesn't improve most business bottom or top lines like data centers can.

My point? Expect some noise in the signal of free cash flow growth, namely, as the other segments ebb and flow while the data center grows.

Valuation

Based on this summary, I'm going to show two valuations, both using a Discounted Cash Flow, or DCF, model. I'll make the following assumptions:

$1,702M in annual free cash flow.

CAGR of 25% for the next decade.

Terminal multiple of 20.

My FCF figure is the average for 2019-2023, which I think captures the recent patterns with cycles. With the opportunity presented by AI, I think a very high growth rate like 25% is feasible, even as long as a decade. I give a terminal multiple of 20 just to allow for some potential decline as we reach the other side and as perhaps current levels of hype may not exist.

Author's calculation

This suggests a fair value per share of about $98. This is priced at a 10% discount rate (typical return of a broad market index), so positive returns are still possible, maybe not as high as that of the market. Still, we need to consider the potential downside posed by the SBC and buybacks.

Author's calculation

If we factor in the outflows from past buybacks that have coincided with SBC, that roughly brings current levels of FCF down to about $400M, suggesting a much lower intrinsic value.

Conclusion

With strong financial results and a recent campaign by CFO Jean Hu to clarify where AMD thrives, the company is poised to remain in the game and give Nvidia a run for their money. The main risks to long-term Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. investors aren't on the operational side, but in the potential for free cash flow lost on stock-based compensation and buybacks. We should continue to observe what kind of appetite the company has for its own shares and if this regime of SBC will continue.

Even if that plays out favorably, the current price isn't signaling a clear discount to that future. Considering how easily the market was able to sour on AMD in 2022, perhaps today's prospective buyers would be better served by asking for a better entry price. For these reasons, I consider AMD to be a pretty solid Hold.","FinancialsAMD's free cash flow experienced significant growth over the last five years, with a dip in 2023 after 2022, showing signs of their industry's cyclicality.

Summary

PepsiCo's (NASDAQ:PEP) Q1 '24 net sales of ~$18.3bn came in above consensus estimates by ~1%. Volumes declined by ~2% vs consensus at ~3%, with Frito-Lay North America (""FLNA"") declining ~2% (vs consensus -1.5%) PepsiCo Beverages North America (""PBNA"") declining ~5% (vs consensus -5%). Its price/mix growth of ~5% was broadly in line with consensus at 5.4% in most geographies. Operating income of ~$2.9Bn came in ~4% ahead of consensus but did not include ~$170MM of product recall costs at Quaker Foods North America (""QFNA""), which was worth 6 points of operating income growth. Including these costs, Core EPS is in line with consensus at ~$1.52.

With the pressures highlighted in our initial report persisting, we continue to believe Pepsi’s valuation is stretched and maintain our target price of $151/share and Sell rating.

Earnings Update

International

As sales growth in North America continues to normalize, PepsiCo’s international segments are starting to draw more attention from investors. Sales outside of North America represented ~39% of total sales in 2023, and its international footprint is relatively concentrated (n.b., top 5 markets representing ~19% of group sales, with the remainder split amongst another ~190 countries).

In the 10 years preceding COVID, Pepsi's international markets saw ~8% organic sales growth p.a., +4x North America’s ~1.6% growth, and carrying the group's average of growth of ~4%. We see the greatest long-term opportunity in India, where it has a robust local snacks portfolio (i.e., Kurkure, etc.) and its beverages portfolio has largely been refranchised to the local operator, Varun Beverages.

Despite the strong growth profile in international segments, it is important to note that faster international sales growth pressures the group's operating margin. Granted, this pressure is less pronounced now than it has been in recent years due to improving profitability in LatAm (n.b., aided by favorable currency movements) and in Russia.

In Q1, PepsiCo’s international segments saw 9% organic sales growth, more than offsetting the weaker performance in North America (-0.6%).

APAC

The APAC division saw 12% volume growth in Q1, driven by 12% growth in convenient foods (i.e., snacks) and offset by a slight decline in beverages. China represents ~57% of Pepsi’s APAC sales, and a disclosure in the 10Q indicated a double-digit snacks volume growth compared to a high-single-digit comp in the prior year, though beverage volumes declined by mid-single-digits (n.b., low-single-digit growth in the prior year).

Russia

Russia is coming off 2 years of soft volume comps in both its convenient foods and beverages portfolios, driving double-digit volume growth in these categories in Q1. Pepsi’s European division (of which Russia represents ~27% of sales) posted a 3% volume growth in Q1. Growth in Russia helped offset the double-digit volume declines in France, which came about as a result of disputes with retailer Carrefour.

QFNA

QFNA suffered from 2 product recalls in December '23 and January '24 for potential salmonella contamination in certain granola bars and cereals, both stemming from the Danville plant in Illinois.

The Danville plant has been quarantined. QFNA only has 5 plants, so the impact on sales has been material. In Q1, QFNA’s sales declined by ~24%, and its operating margin fell to -7.6% (n.b., ~21% excluding the recall-related costs). Management expects the impact of the recall to moderate over the balance of the year.

In April '24, it was announced that the Danville plant would be permanently closed by June '24. The plant closure will make more than 500 employees redundant (n.b., ~2% of Danville’s population). We understand that the investment required to remediate the potential contamination issues was too costly, which drove the decision to close it.

Production from Danville will be reallocated to other facilities, likely to the large plant in Cedar Rapids, Iowa (n.b., the largest cereal milling plant in the world). It is unclear whether additional capex will be required to facilitate this, adding further risk to the near-term financial outlook.

PBNA

PBNA volumes declined ~5% in Q1, with carbonated soft drink (""CSD"") volumes declining ~3% and non-carbonated beverages (""NCB"") volumes declining ~7%.

Excluding the contribution from Celsius ((CSD)), we estimate NCB volumes declined by low double-digits, mostly due to Gatorade (n.b., disclosures in the 10Q indicate double-digit volume declines vs a high-single-digit decline in Q1 '23). As discussed in our previous report, the sports drinks category has become incredibly competitive, which we believe will lead to sustained pressure on Gatorade's volumes.

CSD volumes were aided by the launch of Mountain Dew Baja Blast as a permanent line extension. As discussed in our previous report, Mountain Dew faces secular volume pressure as consumers shift towards sugar-free energy drinks. PBNA saw ~6% price/mix growth in the quarter, with the negative mix effect from Gatorade volumes offset by pricing and growth at Celsius.

FLNA

FLNA missed consensus expectations for all key metrics, with volumes declining ~2% vs consensus at 1.5%, price/mix of +3% vs consensus at +3.6%), resulting in sales of ~$5.7bn (n.b., ~0.5% below consensus) and an operating margin of ~27.8% (n.b., -90bps to consensus at 28.7%).

Valuation

In our view, Pepsi’s valuation is quite stretched for a business we see delivering ~6% long-term EPS growth p.a. with considerable risks clouding the picture. As we discussed in our previous report, GLP-1 agonists are a risk to FLNA, a division that has historically driven roughly half of the group's organic growth. Additionally, Russia accounts for ~5% of the group's EPS, which presents a set of potential risks (i.e., potential impact of sanctions, cash expatriation, etc.).

Our $151 target price implies a forward P/E of ~19x, a modest ~5% discount to the long-term average, and is based on a 10Y DCF model. We assume a 7.5% WACC, ~4% post-currency sales growth, ~17% operating margin in year 10 and ROIC of ~19%. This equates to ~19x forward P/E with a ~3% yield and implied return of -8%. We maintain our Sell rating.

Forecast & Multiples (Empyrean)

The company is trading at a ~13% premium to the consumer staples sector's '25E P/E (n.b., historical premium is ~ 10%). Pepsi's higher ROIC justifies a premium to peers, but we see the current premium as being too high, given our forecast for sector-average organic sales growth (~4% p.a.) led by price/mix and a below-average operating margin which is reliant on cost savings.

Trading Comps (Empyrean)

Risks to our forecasts include (1) weaker US consumer spending, (2) the seizure of Pepsi's Russian assets, (3) greater adoption of GLP-1 agonists affecting FLNA’s sales, and (4) a deeper decline in PBNA’s volumes.

Upside catalysts include: (1) US snacking habits proving more resilient than anticipated, (2) commodity costs easing, and (3) better progress in energy drinks following Rockstar’s packaging refresh.

Conclusion

Despite beating consensus estimates on certain metrics, we see Pepsi as being overvalued in the context of continued volume pressure at PBNA and FLNA, recalls at QFNA, and the overhang of its Russian businesses. We maintain our Sell rating and $151 target price.","Earnings UpdateInternationalAs sales growth in North America continues to normalize, PepsiCo’s international segments are starting to draw more attention from investors.
Despite the strong growth profile in international segments, it is important to note that faster international sales growth pressures the group's operating margin.
In Q1, PepsiCo’s international segments saw 9% organic sales growth, more than offsetting the weaker performance in North America (-0.6%).
APACThe APAC division saw 12% volume growth in Q1, driven by 12% growth in convenient foods (i.e., snacks) and offset by a slight decline in beverages.

Reflecting on any prior time period, in this case Q2 2024, it’s important to do so in the context of the totality of the picture we’re trying to understand. In the present context of economics and investing, how do we know what to value? When and how do things matter together, in what way(s) do they affect the economy’s health, what matters right now, and what are the essential longer-term requisites for our society to thrive?

The Market Environment Today

Growth in the U.S. economy continues to come in above expectations, despite elevated interest rates, weakness in some major international economies, and a drawdown of consumer savings. Although real GDP growth slowed in the first quarter of this year, it’s looking increasingly as though policymakers have helped avoid a recession, all while bringing inflation closer to the Federal Reserve’s preferred 2% target. Consumer spending has remained strong for the first half of 2024 due to sustained improvements in the labor market and stable levels of spending by business and government sectors. These factors are projected to support real GDP growth for the remainder of this year.

This bodes well for continued economic growth for the rest of the year, but of course these general trends, based as they are on historical data points, can be - usually are - affected by other market and exogenous events.

Short-to-medium-term downside risks complicate any outlook. Continued geopolitical conflicts and trade actions will probably cause inflation to stay higher for longer than it otherwise would, which could in turn cause the Fed to raise rates, contrary to the accepted narrative that cuts are coming in Q4. The picture then may look something like: the consumer price index (CPI) inflation stays above the 3% threshold for the third quarter of this year, spooking the Fed’s hawks and another rate hike proposal is put on the table. This is a medium possibility. Less likely but still possible is that, because of the tariffs and geopolitical events in Ukraine, the Middle East, and elsewhere causing a possible oil price shock ($100 or more?), the Fed may be driven to hike rates twice in the near term. Even with this Fed action, in this scenario CPI inflation may stay above 3% well into 2025.

More likely, we believe, is that in the second half of 2024, job growth slows because current levels of job formation are not sustainable given demographics and labor force participation. As a result, the unemployment rate grows in the short term, as the effects of the last series of rate hikes continue to reverberate and discourage new investments in the economy, although this will be partially offset by major investments prompted by the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA), at least in the manufacturing sector. In addition, investments in intellectual property - such as the use of AI and other novel technologies - will continue to drive growth in the business sector, revealed in strong quarterly reports from the companies best able to capitalize on the trend.

What’s a likely scenario for Q3 and Q4? The story is positive overall. Consumer spending will likely continue to rise probably in the same ballpark as the 2.2% increase in 2023. Business investment so far is down a shade in 2024 from a strong 4.5% last year, but is still robust, and government spending will rise at least 2%. If these occur - Green Alpha’s base case scenario - the U.S. economy will probably continue to outperform many other global economies in the short term.

But we can’t overemphasize the risks of a full-blown trade war. Deglobalization trendiness aside, the world is presently economically so interconnected that it is not difficult to imagine significant tariff action slowing GDP growth to under 1%.

Rolling this up, it’s as likely as any outcome that CPI may finally fall a little by the end of 2024, and the Fed will then attempt to engineer their desired “soft landing” by cutting rates once or twice in the second half of 2024 and then continue with cuts until reaching their neutral rate of 2.5% to 3% by 2027.

What Will be the Effects of AI?

AI is more than a buzzword; the increasing sophistication and availability has already replaced some jobs and creating new ones. This transformation will continue - and since technological change is not linear, there is the possibility - even likelihood - of fast changes that help boost productivity significantly. In this scenario, GDP will rise faster than expected and could exceed 3% per year, quite a bit higher than the Fed’s 2% forecast. This scenario also results in higher long-term potential for the economy. In that sense, productivity gains from AI show that rapid economic growth can remain sustainable in the long run. Artificial Intelligence is infusing every sector, leading to productivity gains Green Alpha thinks will continue to accelerate across industries.

Longer Term

Given the uncertainty in the world today, perhaps it’s not surprising that many investors are inclined to choose index funds over active management and stock picking. The index worked historically, so it feels safe, and, even if it isn’t, index investors can feel assured that they’re in the same risk boat as most other investors. Green Alpha thinks differently.

We love finding the most innovative firms across industries and company sizes that are growing faster than underlying GDP and consolidating market share away from solutions of the past. This results in uncorrelated, high active-share portfolios, and that gives us a huge advantage in terms of strategic positioning as the economy evolves.

Green Alpha’s 5-to-10-year focus is our advantage. Our time frame mismatch with the market zeitgeist is working: our relatively volatile performance compared to benchmark indices (both outperforming and underperforming, variously), provides opportunity to acquire exposure to the evolution of the economy entirely outside of today’s ultimately ephemeral CPI discussions. Disruptive innovation offers long-term opportunities for exponential growth not easily found in indexes.

Our portfolios have been underperforming some major U.S. benchmarks for the trailing 1.5 years or so, as the Fed’s 20x increase in interest rates put pressure on long time horizon assets. Notably this includes the world’s most innovative companies: higher interest rates increase the discount rate used to calculate the theoretical value today of a guesstimated future stream of cash flows, which makes those cash flows appear less valuable. All of that is, of course, temporary and almost doesn’t matter relative to the larger view of which companies are taking market share with their better mousetraps and are.

When the Fed moves to lower interest rates, companies that have been innovating to make better, cheaper, faster, more productive goods and services will be the first and highest beneficiaries.

The bottom line? The economy is complex, messy, and full of surprises. But if you’re willing to look past the short-term noise and focus on the long game of innovation and productivity gains, there’s a lot to be excited about.

Taiwan may have seen two successive rate hike surprises (first in March and another one in June), but external demand tailwinds have been so strong that markets have outperformed anyway. Accelerating macro indicators for Taiwan's tech-dominated equity universe, including export and industrial production data, indicate that this trend isn't likely to slow anytime soon.

Bloomberg

At the micro level, pipeline updates from this year's Apple (AAPL) 'Worldwide Developers Conference', spanning new AI features and other product updates, further supports the case for longer-term tech momentum. And in the near term, a rebound in handset shipments bodes well for the many Apple-focused supply chain names in Franklin Templeton's FTSE Taiwan ETF (NYSEARCA:FLTW) portfolio.

Bloomberg

Besides the fundamental 'picks and shovels' tailwind, FLTW offers an interesting technical setup to boot. The key lies in how staple holding Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing (TSM), the world's premier semiconductor foundry, has seen its stock not only double since last year but also outperform the other large-cap index components by a long way. The implication here is that as TSM breaches concentration limits, passive flows will rotate into the ex-TSM components at each review, boosting the other liquid Taiwanese names. By virtue of a stricter weightage cap on TSM, FLTW stands to benefit disproportionately from each rebalancing.

Data by YCharts

The other big technical tailwind for FLTW is its access to TSM's Taiwan listing. For context, US-listed depositary receipts (or 'ADRs') have seen their premium to the equivalent Taiwan listing blow up this year – likely in reaction to TSM's 'picks and shovels' AI appeal. Yet, arbitrageurs have caught on, and the current unsustainably high +20% ADR premium is bound to narrow eventually, in my view. Either way, FLTW's exposure to the discounted Taiwan listing makes it appealing - both as a potential beneficiary of a narrowing spread and a much safer way to gain TSM exposure. In the meantime, FLTW investors get paid a well-covered low-single-digit (and growing) yield to wait.

Bloomberg

FLTW Overview – The Go-To Taiwan Vehicle for Fee-Sensitive Investors

The US-listed Franklin FTSE Taiwan ETF is one of two major US-listed large-cap Taiwanese tracker funds, the other being iShares' MSCI Taiwan Capped ETF (EWT). Fundamentally, FLTW's key difference is its more rigid concentration limits – particularly relevant in the Taiwanese market, where one major stock (TSMC) dominates.

Unsurprisingly, given how the Taiwan market has performed, managed assets have grown further since I last covered the fund (see FLTW: Taiwan Gets The Post-Election Green Light). But liquidity, as evidenced by a slightly wider ~9bps bid/ask spread, hasn't improved quite as much. In combination with its industry-low fee structure (~0.2% expense ratio vs ~0.6% for EWT), though, FLTW retains its cost advantage by a clear margin.

Franklin Templeton

FLTW Portfolio – Tech Heavy but with Limits

FLTW may have added to its 124-stock portfolio this quarter (vs. 90 holdings for EWT), but its sector exposure to Information Technology has reached a larger-than-ever 66.2%. The other major sector allocation, Financials, is also up to 17.9%, while Industrials and Materials are down to 4.5% and 3.8%, respectively. From a sector perspective, FLTW is now the more top-heavy of the two Taiwan ETFs, so investors should continue to be mindful of the concentration risks.

Franklin Templeton

FLTW is, however, the more diversified option at the single-stock level. Its largest allocation, Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing, continues to bump up against the 20% cap, though a semi-annual rebalancing process helps with the position sizing. By comparison, EWT, by virtue of its less rigid weightage caps, has a slightly larger TSM allocation at ~24%.

The rest of FLTW's major holdings gain a bigger allocation as a result of the TSM cap, with weightings for tech supply chain names like Hon Hai Precision (OTCPK:HNHPF) (7.9%) and MediaTek (OTCPK:MDTTF) (6.4%) running slightly higher than EWT. In essence, FLTW investors benefit not only from a more balanced cross-section of Taiwan but also from flows rotating out of TSM (and into the rest of Taiwan tech) at upcoming rebalancing exercises.

Franklin Templeton

FLTW Performance – The Upward Momentum Extends into 2024

After a standout 2023, which saw FLTW return low-double-digits, the fund is once again on a red hot streak this year. Helped by a Q2 surge, the fund has now returned +18.2% year-to-date (+18.6% total return at NAV) – despite a shaky start to the year amid election uncertainties. Note that FLTW is also ahead of EWT by around one percentage point to date and by a much larger margin over the last year. Thus, purely from a performance standpoint, FLTW has been the pick of the Taiwanese large-cap ETFs.

Data by YCharts

To be clear, this delta isn't a one-off. Over longer three and five-year timelines, FLTW has compounded at a slightly higher pace than EWT, highlighting the advantages of its broader, more diversified approach to portfolio construction.

Franklin Templeton

Having rallied strongly this year, FLTW's distribution yield is also lower, though, at ~2.5%. But with Taiwanese large-caps poised to ride some very attractive near and long-term tech tailwinds, the case for further earnings growth and, by extension, dividend growth is as strong as it's ever been.

Morningstar

The higher June payout only lends support to this view, as does consensus forecasts for Taiwan earnings to grow at a region-leading +26% pace this year (high-teens % in 2025/2026). So, while the fund isn't optically cheap at ~21x trailing earnings (~19x forward P/E for MSCI Taiwan), there remains ample room here for FLTW to grow into its valuation over time.

Yardeni

Ride the Tech Tailwinds with Taiwan

Taiwanese stocks have gone from strength to strength post-election, and deservedly so, given the way earnings growth is pacing. Both macro (export, production) and micro (handset shipment) indicators point to more momentum going forward as well, so this rally likely still has legs. As the lowest cost and highest returning passive fund, tech-heavy FLTW screens attractively from a fundamental perspective, though the technical setup, by virtue of its access to discounted Taiwan listings, makes it particularly interesting as well. Net-net, I remain upbeat on this tech-heavy fund.","By virtue of a stricter weightage cap on TSM, FLTW stands to benefit disproportionately from each rebalancing.

Seeking Alpha,https://seekingalpha.com/article/4702116-staking-claim-with-inverted-curves?source=feed_all_articles,2024-07-02,19:05:00 UTC,Staking A 'Claim' With Inverted Curves,"Melpomenem

Remember when an inverted yield curve used to predict recessions? Here we are about two years removed from the Treasury yield curve moving into negative territory, and the U.S. economy has yet to move into recession territory. The economy’s resilience has certainly been a surprisingly welcome development and has left many a market participant wondering what happened. Indeed, history has shown us that the track record of inverted yield curves predicting a recession was almost foolproof. Now, I certainly don’t want to put a whammy on things, but if you’re wondering why an economic downturn has yet to occur, perhaps you don’t need to look any further than the relatively solid labor market setting.

There is no question that the monthly Employment Situation report is essentially either 1 or 1A in terms of importance, not just for the money and bond markets but for the Fed as well. Recently, inflation data has also snuck into the top category, but that’s for another blog.

Source: St. Louis Fed, as of 6/21/24.

Another set of employment data that is rather useful to focus on is the initial jobless claims series. This report comes out weekly and offers investors and policy makers a more “real-time” look at labor market trends. In addition, it is one of the 10 leading economic indicators.

This series has captured its own fair share of headlines since the Fed began its aggressive rate hike cycle, as market participants have been looking for clues to any adverse impact this tightening episode may have had on the labor markets. Once again, in surprising fashion, the level of new weekly unemployment claims has remained historically low despite the rise in interest rates.

There have been periods in the last year or so when the level of new claimants would rise unexpectedly, but then in future reports, the number would come back down again. More recently, the weekly reading rose to a 10-month-high watermark, and needless to say, there was some chatter that this increase could finally be a sign that the labor markets may be beginning to soften up.

While perhaps that may prove to be the case, I thought it would be prudent to put the level of jobless claims into some perspective and not rush to any conclusions. In order to get a more accurate picture, I decided to go back and look at the 40-year period prior to COVID-19 for some guidance. Interestingly, this also coincides with many analyses regarding the inverted yield curve and recession relationship.

So, what does one discover about the current reading of 238,000 new jobless claims? Two very important factoids:

It is at least 100,000 or more below the levels that existed prior to the past four recessions.

It is 125,000 below the average level of claims for this 40-year period.

Conclusion

While the monthly inflation data might be getting “top billing” of late, investors should also remember the importance of labor market trends and their impact on Fed policy, a point Chairman Powell reiterated at the June FOMC presser. Against this backdrop, the weekly jobless claims report can serve as a useful indicator for investors to focus on, but as yet, it is not flashing any warning signals.

American Airlines Group Inc. (NASDAQ:AAL) came out of the pandemic with optimism that the industry reset that impacted all airlines would give it a chance to change the trajectory of its financial underperformance to the industry that included much of the decade before the COVID crisis. Even though American Airlines (under AMR Corporation) was restructured under Chapter 11 of the U.S. bankruptcy code from 2011 to 2013, ending in its emergence as AAL and its merger with US Airways, AAL's revenue generation remained below its peers and its costs were high, in part due to deals which were made with labor to secure their backing for the US Airways merger over AMR's standalone restructuring plan. Although American and US Airways stated that one of the primary objectives of the merger was to be able to compete with Delta Air Lines, Inc. (DAL), which initiated the megamerger cycle via its merger with Northwest, United Airlines Holdings, Inc. (UAL), which merged with Continental, and Southwest Airlines Co. (LUV), which acquired AirTran Airways, American struggled to compete in the major competitive coastal markets including New York City as well as international markets in the late 2010s, resulting in its reduced attractiveness to high-value business travelers.

With the largest workforce and a goal of keeping airline employees on the job and able to serve the public when demand returned, American received the most federal grant money during the pandemic as its unions and executives were influential in the process of obtaining government help for the industry. American and Southwest both aggressively added capacity in the early stages of the pandemic whenever it appeared there might be the potential for demand recovery.

American revised its guidance on May 28 with a further deterioration of revenue and operating margin with slightly improved non-fuel and fuel costs.

Revenue Underperformance

American's revenue performance relative to Delta and United can be seen from the following:

Total Revenue per Available Seat Mile (% change)

Full year 2023 4Q2023 1Q2024

American +1 -6.4 -4.9

Delta +3 -3 +1

United +1.7 - 4.2 +0.6

DAL has long been known to generate a revenue premium to the industry which is a large driver of its higher profits standing in contrast to AAL's underperformance including to UAL. Deterioration of the revenue environment in the latter part of 2023 and into the winter of 2023-24 (second quarter 2023 and first quarter 2024) can be seen in the data above. Since international travel typically contributes profits in the middle two quarters but less so in at the beginning and end of the year, AAL's underperformance can be somewhat understood but it still underperformed for 2023 as a whole. Other data shows that they are underperforming in revenue generation even in the domestic market.

Travel Affordability (Airlines.org)

As post-pandemic demand returned first in the domestic sector, American showed promise of being able to overcome its financial woes of the previous decade. However, in the following year, as international demand began to return, American increasingly was left behind by Delta and United, both of which had larger international route systems pre-pandemic and were committed to restarting their international operations, although the two employed different strategies to meet the returning international demand. American, like Delta, retired older and less efficient international aircraft during the pandemic but DAL had to regrow its international fleet in order to rebuild its network. United, in contrast, did not retire international or domestic aircraft during the pandemic, stating that it would be ready to grow when demand returned. Indeed, in the third quarter of 2022, United generated significantly higher margins than American and Delta because it was able to meet international demand which most other global airlines were not prepared to serve but that advantage lasted only for one quarter.

Allocation of capital by category (Airlines.org)

Delta had an extensive order book with Airbus SE (OTCPK:EADSY) for widebody long-haul aircraft while American had a relatively small The Boeing Company (BA) 787 order book; United added to its 787 order book and now is the largest customer for that aircraft type, expecting to be able to aggressively grow. American recognized during the pandemic that it could not successfully compete in most of the transpacific markets it previously flew and did not attempt to replace the transpacific capacity it had pre-COVID. Demand across the Atlantic post-COVID has been strong but American's European profitability has long been centered in London where it operates a joint venture hub with International Consolidated Airlines Group S.A. (OTCPK:ICAGY). Many of AAL's continental European destinations have long underperformed DAL and UAL in terms of revenue and the company similarly has chosen not to grow its fleet to chase transatlantic demand. U.S. DOT data shows that American lost money flying both the Atlantic and Pacific in 2023 with its small international profits coming entirely from its Latin America route system centered around Miami where it has a near monopoly position among U.S. carriers to Latin America. While AAL recognized it was going to be much smaller to Europe and across the Pacific, it missed out on the international revenue growth that has buoyed the results of Delta and United.

U.S. Airline ROIC (Airlines.org)

American's revenue issues have also involved domestic markets. AAL's domestic passenger revenue per seat mile was down 2.8% in the first quarter of 2024, in line with its transatlantic system; in contrast, DAL's domestic RASM for the quarter was up 3%. Multiple U.S. airlines saw unit revenue declines in Latin America due to large increases in capacity while the Pacific was particularly troubling for American due to heavy competitive capacity increases even though AAL's Pacific capacity was down.

As I have highlighted in previous articles including most recently in March 2024, American has been focused on reducing its sales costs. Growing evidence indicates those efforts were not successful and alienated some of American's top customers including corporate and other high-value customers. American's Chief Commercial Officer left the airline in June after a 20-year career at the company. He was an architect of AAL's strategies to reduce the airline's distribution costs which included incentivizing booking travel through the most efficient technologies but also withholding benefits to travelers that are booked through more traditional mechanisms. In addition, the company reversed several of the distribution policies that were implemented under Mr. Raja.

AAL's strategies appear to have raised concerns with some of American's closest business partners as well. British Airways made airline news by deciding to implement a codeshare agreement with Alaska Air Group, Inc. (ALK) and JetBlue Airways Corporation (JBLU) even though the U.K. airline has a revenue sharing joint venture with American. Alaska, with its largest hub in Seattle, is part of the same oneworld alliance as American and British Airways but is not part of the transatlantic joint venture. New York City-based JetBlue is not in the oneworld alliance or the joint venture. British Airways' actions are likely because it is either seeing or fears seeing an impact on its corporate sales efforts in the U.S.

Labor and Service Issues

In addition to its revenue and strategic challenges, American is facing a deteriorating labor situation with its flight attendants which are the only workgroup at the Ft. Worth-based airline that has not seen a new contract after COVID. Airline labor contracts are governed by the Railway Labor Act and those contracts do not expire but become amendable. Most airline labor contracts became amendable during the COVID era but airlines and unions postponed settlement until stability was reached in the industry. American's flight attendant union contract became amendable in 2019 which means the company has not given any pay raises in five years. American and its flight attendant union have been in federal mediated negotiations for months including a rare session in Washington, D.C. on Saturday after ""last ditch"" negotiations last week failed to result in a settlement. The union has set up a strike center. The union does not have the resources to pay strike pay. The union released a statement Sunday saying that the company and union remain in negotiations which means the National Mediation Board cannot declare an impasse which would be necessary for the union to strike.

Airline Industry Unit Costs by Category (Airlines.org)

Delta kicked off the post-covid pay raises among the big 4 airlines with a new contract with its pilots in December 2022 followed by raises in 2023 for its largely non-union workforce, including its flight attendants. Among the big 4, Southwest settled with its flight attendants earlier this year, adding to its costs but helping to unify the workforce at the embattled carrier. Southwest's contract with its flight attendants provides retroactive pay, something Delta did not offer its non-union employees since they received pay raises early in the post-COVID recovery. American's flight attendant union asked for pay raises in line with what pilots received. After Southwest's contract approval with retroactive pay was announced, American's flight attendant union added retroactive pay to its list of demands although it is not certain if American or United, which also has an outstanding flight attendant contract, would offer retroactive pay to flight attendants. Each of the big 3 airlines spent the better part of $1 billion in retroactive pay for their unionized pilots. American, with the weakest earnings and balance sheet of the big 4, would likely struggle to pay retroactive pay as well as significant pay raises to its 25,000 flight attendants, its largest workgroup.

Since flight attendants spend more time with airline passengers than any other workgroup, the prolonged negotiations have had an impact on American's service levels. Many customers have perceived that American's cost-cutting efforts have tarnished its customer service while others believe the carrier offers comparable service to Delta and United. While individuals have different perceptions of quality, J.D. Power ranks American lower than both Delta and United for premium cabin service and lower than Southwest and Delta for economy passengers but above United.

JD Power 2024 First/Business Ratings (JD Power) JD Power 2024 economy ratings (JD Power)

American focused on operational reliability in 2023 and made significant progress. Performance this year has not been as good, compounded by bad weather esp. in May at American's hub at Dallas/Ft. Worth airport, the nation's second-largest. There is a lag of at least two months for DOT data to be released but, through March, American ranks as the #6 airline YTD even though AAL's on-time is just 1% below average and similar to Southwest. Private sector data provides more updated information showing AAL's decline in on-time relative to other carriers.

US Airline Domestic On-Time YTD March 2024 (U.S. Dept. of Transportation) US Airline On-Time Trends (CrankyFlier.com)

American's baggage handling has consistently been near the bottom of the industry and DOT data shows that AAL and UAL share the bottom spot. American also holds the lowest spot of the large airlines for involuntary denied boarding. American's low customer service performance is certain to negatively impact its ability to acquire high-value passengers, esp. when combined with the company's sales strategies.

Slower Growth

Even though American placed an order for over 225 aircraft in March 2024, split between Airbus, Boeing, and Embraer S.A. (ERJ), the company announced in late June that it was suspending pilot hiring for the remainder of 2024, blaming delivery delays from Airbus and Boeing. Other airlines including Southwest have also suspended pilot hiring for 2024. Suspending pilot hiring is particularly significant for American since it has one of the oldest pilot workforces among U.S. airlines and expects approximately 800 pilots/year to reach mandatory retirement age in the next few years.

AAL Fleet Plan March 2024 (AA.com)

AAL's fleet plan calls for pushing beyond 1000 mainline aircraft, something United has also released as part of its fleet plan but which Delta may achieve first. American's fleet plan does see growth in its widebody fleet which, in terms of the number of aircraft, is almost as high as its domestic narrowbody fleet. American is not backing down on its commitment to regional jets, maintaining a fleet of 580 regional jets including those flown by its wholly owned subsidiaries. Part of the recent order includes E175 jets which will replace older and smaller regional jets and ensure American's regional jet operation remains large well beyond 2030. American currently operates the highest percentage of its network on regional jets which brings its average aircraft size to the lowest size among the big 3 airlines plus ALK that use regional jets.

Average seats per departure (Airlines.org)

While American will likely slow mainline capacity growth, even though it has not been announced, it has not retreated from its commitment to serve small cities with regional jets, esp. from its southern U.S. hubs of Charlotte and DFW. While AAL says that its strategy of connecting small cities to its global network provides a unique advantage, it is not clear that the advantage has translated into increased revenues. As pilot hiring at the large jet airlines slows, the result is increased numbers of pilots at regional airlines so other airlines are also increasing their service to small cities.

AAL stock has disappointed

American Airlines is one of the big 3 global carriers that have enjoyed a surge in global demand. While economists have frequently suggested that a weakening of demand would come to the airline industry, peers Delta and United have seen strong demand that has defied those macroeconomic expectations; American should be more closely aligned with the performance of global carriers DAL and UAL rather than low cost and ultra-low-cost carriers that have seen a significant deterioration in their finances. Further, AAL's smaller order book means that it could be spared some of the challenges that other airlines are experiencing due to Boeing's delivery delays and problems with the Pratt and Whitney, a subsidiary of RTX Corporation (RTX), Geared Turbofan engine which American does not operate. Finally, it is possible that American will reach an agreement with its flight attendant union which will be within what the company can afford without degrading AAL's financial performance. It is possible, therefore, that AAL could overcome the challenges that I have suggested and continue its upward trend which I suggested earlier this year the company should be able to do.

However, many of us, myself included, had hope that American Airlines could regain its position as a leader in the U.S. airline industry, the sheer number of challenges AAL faces on top of the stock price declines make it unlikely that AAL will deliver even industry-comparable stock performance. The best large jet U.S. airline stock has been DAL and it is nearly back to its year-ago level. AAL is 35% lower over the past year, the worst of the big 6 airlines. On a year-to-date basis, DAL and UAL are up 18% while AAL is down the same amount. AAL has been one of the worst performers on Wall Street and has recently been the most shorted S&P 500 industrial stocks; AAL cannot shake investor pessimism and the large-scale issues it continues to face make it unlikely that it will convince investors that it can be turned around.

Big 6 US Airline 1 year Chart (Seeking Alpha)

A review of airline stocks over the last 3 years shows that airline stocks post-COVID have declined in the summer and into the fall, regaining strength in the winter, only to repeat the cycle in the following year. Airline industry stocks for 2024 appear to be following a similar trajectory, likely as investors receive guidance about the best revenue periods of the year only to see doubts about long-term performance shape investor mindsets into the fall.

AAL's biggest negative remains its debt even though the company has tried to pay down debt. AAL had a retained deficit of $5.9 billion on March 31, 2024.

AAL vs industry balance sheet (Seeking Alpha) AAL balance sheet 1Q2024 (AA.com)

Considering the trajectory of U.S. airline stocks, AAL's eroded position in the industry, and its challenges including below-average revenue generation and likely intensifying labor and customer service issues, a SELL rating is appropriate for AAL.","American revised its guidance on May 28 with a further deterioration of revenue and operating margin with slightly improved non-fuel and fuel costs.

Seeking Alpha,https://seekingalpha.com/article/4702106-commerce-bancshares-an-exceptional-bank-that-deserves-more-attention?source=feed_all_articles,2024-07-02,18:45:04 UTC,Commerce Bancshares: An Exceptional Bank That Deserves More Attention (NASDAQ:CBSH),"Peddalanka Ramesh Babu/iStock via Getty Images

Commerce Bancshares, Inc. (NASDAQ:CBSH) is the bank holding company of Commerce Bank and has been in this industry for 159 years straight. Despite a market capitalization of $7.23 billion and total assets of $32 billion, it is not a very popular bank. In fact, you can see even on Seeking Alpha how little it is discussed. Yet, in my opinion, CBSH deserves more attention given the consistency of its performance over the decades.

Comparison with peers

To better understand the qualities of this bank, I think it is useful to compare it with peers. The next slides refer to FY 2023, not Q1 2024, but they are still reliable and useful for visually understanding how dominant CBSH is.

2024 Annual Shareholder’s Meeting

As you can see, CBSH ranks second in terms of ROA, ROE and Capital Ratio; first in terms of credit risk management. In other words, this bank is almost the best in terms of profitability and financial strength, and at the same time none has so few troubled loans/ total loans.

The secret of this excellent performance lies behind a careful choice in the selection of clients with whom to operate, as well as a greater focus on other business areas. Typically, we are used to thinking that banks generate almost all of their revenues from interest on loans made, but for CBSH this is not quite the case.

2024 Annual Shareholder’s Meeting

As you can see from this image, net interest income accounts for 63% of total revenues, for peers this figure rises to 81%. Thus, CBSH's revenues are much more diversified and rely on various alternative activities such as asset management and payments. CBSH has an AUM of about $70 billion, 60% of which is actively managed (so it gets above-average fees). In addition, the consumer payment business is also well-developed.

This diversification allows CBSH to succeed in growing even in complex times such as the current one. Indeed, demand for credit has deteriorated a lot as interest rates have risen, but the wealth management and payments segments make revenues less cyclical.

2024 Annual Shareholder’s Meeting

Finally, in addition to having largely above-average capital ratios, the Average Loan to Deposit Ratio is only 70% versus 84% for peers. This means that CBSH has a rather flexible financial structure and can cope with higher loan demand.

Prospects and dividends

As mentioned, it is not an easy time to increase the loan portfolio; in fact, high interest rates are weakening the economy. This is not only a problem for CBSH, but for the entire industry.

Commerce Bancshares Q1 2024

The yield on loans continues to increase, but at the same time, new loans fail to exceed maturing loans. On the other hand, the cost of deposits continues to rise, and the inflow of deposits cannot overcome the outflow. This may seem like a worrisome situation at first glance, but there are several reasons that keep me optimistic:

First, CBSH does not need new deposits since it has a very low Loan to Deposit ratio. Increasing them by granting CDs with a yield above 4% would only be a detriment, especially considering that demand for loans is still sluggish.

Second, the net interest margin is up 16 basis points from the previous quarter and up 7 basis points from last year. As of Q1 2024, it has reached 3.33%. Thus, profitability is not in trouble.

Commerce Bancshares Q1 2024

Third, non-interest income continues to increase quarter by quarter. To date, it accounts for 37.40% of total income and manages to offset the disappointing growth in loans.

In any case, it is worth clarifying that loan demand is not sluggish everywhere, but there are a few high-growth areas that CBSH is focusing heavily on.

2024 Annual Shareholder’s Meeting

By the way, it is interesting to note that fee income growth was higher than loan growth, and this is a positive factor since the first is a high-yield business:

But just as important really is the fee growth, which has actually outpaced loan growth in this window of time. So, we are excited about the prospects for the future here to date it’s been mostly about projecting our commercial business line into these markets, but we see a lot of opportunity related to wealth management in these areas as well, so that’s something we will be emphasizing in the future. […] As of end of the year, we oversaw about $70 billon in client assets, about 60% of which we actively manage. This is a business with, I’d say, very nice financial return characteristics. It’s relatively low risk and it’s relatively steady. And most importantly, it’s complementary to everything else that we do for our customers – those could be families, those could be commercial customers, other institutions. It really allows us to build, I think, deep and enduring relationships across the bank. CEO John Kemper, 2024 Annual Shareholder’s Meeting.

Finally, to conclude future growth prospects, in addition to loans and asset management, the contribution of the investment portfolio will be crucial.

Commerce Bancshares Q1 2024

CBSH management has done an excellent job over the past few years, the only flaw being the purchase of AFS securities. The securities portfolio is huge relative to total assets, $9.50 billion, and was built at the wrong time. With a duration of 4.3 and an average yield of only 2.18% when cash yields above 5%, the company has accrued some considerable unrealized losses: nearly 25% of equity would be wiped out if the losses were realized.

Nevertheless, at least for now, there is no need to worry since the bank has ample liquidity and capital ratios among the best around. To some extent, we could see this problem as an important opportunity for future growth of the net interest margin. In fact, once the securities expire, they could be replaced by others with a yield of at least 200-300 basis points more.

These maturing securities account for 30% of total assets, and in the next few years, they could drive the net interest margin up even if demand for credit remains sluggish. Finally, unrealized losses are also weighing on TBV per share.

Chart based on SA data

Once the bonds mature, there will also be a boost on TBV per share and this will benefit the price per share. Currently, the market is discounting the higher-for-longer rate scenario, which is why this positive driver has not yet manifested itself.

That said, let us now talk about the dividend, a main topic for any investment thesis in this bank.

Probably few would expect it, but CBSH is a dividend kind since it has consistently issued increasing dividends for 56 years in a row. This is an outstanding achievement and a proof of uncommon strength in virtually any macroeconomic environment. This bank has gone through several recessions and has always increased its dividend despite the banking industry being very cyclical.

Seeking Alpha

What's more, the average annual growth rate over the past 10 years has been 8.76%, 0.99% higher than the industry median.

Chart based on SA data

The only negative note is the dividend yield, only 1.96%. Anyway, if we assume equal dividend growth over the next 10 years, the dividend yield on cost would be 4.54% buying CBSH at the current price. Not bad considering the sustainability of the dividend, which is largely covered by EPS.

Conclusion

CBSH is a solid bank with more than 100 years of history behind it. Over the decades, it has proven to be a trustworthy bank, issuing a growing dividend and weathering any recession. The Fed Funds Rate hike has led to some problems, including large unrealized losses and stalled loan portfolio, but in the end, CBSH I believe will come out stronger than before. In fact, non-operating income continues to grow and the strategic areas in Texas and Oklahoma remain thriving, as does the stability of core deposits.

Overall, I consider Commerce Bancshares, Inc. to be a bank to have in the portfolio and to hold potentially for decades, but I would not build the position at the current price, which is why the rating is a hold.

TIKR

By relating price to TBV per share, we can see that CBSH is trading at a slightly higher multiple than the 10-year average of 2.51x. Personally, this is a parameter that I look at a lot in a bank before buying it, and this signal leads me to wait before investing in it. Obviously, this is my personal valuation, and those who believe strongly in this bank can already start buying it, after all, it is not overvalued.

Commerce Bancshares, Inc. tends to be a bank that has high multiples given its strength, so I am willing to pay a maximum of 2.20x TBV per share for it, but no more.","Peddalanka Ramesh Babu/iStock via Getty ImagesCommerce Bancshares, Inc. (NASDAQ:CBSH) is the bank holding company of Commerce Bank and has been in this industry for 159 years straight.
In other words, this bank is almost the best in terms of profitability and financial strength, and at the same time none has so few troubled loans/ total loans.

Introduction

Welcome to the first post of SA’s The Macro Brief! This official SA Profile will highlight our analysts' latest economic and market analysis to help investors gauge the ever-volatile financial landscape through various recurring series.

The economy is the foundation of financial markets, influencing everything from corporate earnings and consumer spending to central bank policy and inflation. Understanding economic trends, policy decisions, and sector activity can be critical when assessing market opportunities and making informed investment decisions.

With that said, the second issue of Seeking Alpha’s macro-based series is here! (And with a few changes).

It is now called Market and Economic Insights (previously The Macro Brief).

If this is your first time seeing this article series, please take a look at our inaugural issue last month for a more in-depth look at what you can expect.

Without further ado…

June Commentary

As June concludes, marking the year's halfway point, investors naturally take a step back to reevaluate their portfolio holdings, market performance, and economic conditions.

U.S. indexes in June largely carried over momentum from prior months, with the NASDAQ nearing a 6% return. AI themes continued to dominate discussions among investors, with a growing worry that market breadth might be something to start worrying about for the second half of 2024. Bond yields pulled back a bit, but still remain up about 50 basis points across the board year-to-date. On the economic front, unemployment continues to creep northward despite seemingly positive figures from the BLS’s non-farm payrolls report. And inflation seems to be plateauing, with the CPI coming in flat for May month-over-month, but still higher than the Fed’s preferred target of 2% annual growth.

In this issue, our analysts examine…

The state of the markets for the first half and what potentially lies ahead in the second half.

The growing angst among investors as the potential for a market correction comes into play as the markets continue to rise.

The potential implications of diverging easing policies from the global central banks.

June’s Market and Economic Snapshot

Seeking Alpha

June’s Trending Themes

Mid-Year Market Review

3 Predictions For H2 2024 | Bret Jensen

“The rally from late 2023 in the market has carried over into 2024, although the bull move up has been extremely top-heavy. NVIDIA Corporation (NVDA) has ridden the AI wave to better than a 150% return so far this year and by itself accounts for a third of the rise in the overall market.”

First Half Wrap: The AI Boom, Robust Earnings, Auto Sales On Tap | Christine Short

“While it has been an action-packed first half, what's been conspicuously absent from the financial front page has been volatility. The VIX Index had just a lone spike above 20 during a short window in April when equities pared early-year gains.”

2024 Q3: Stay Invested In Big Tech But Watch For Weak Breadth | JR Research

“As we head into the second half of 2024, there is much chatter about weak underlying market breadth. I've assessed that as well. As a result, market conditions are likely mixed and less clear.”

One Down, One To Go | MV Financial

“The first six months of the year were perhaps most notable for steadily weaning the bond market off its fantasies of multiple rate cuts.”

2024 Midyear Investment Outlook: Anticipating Rate Cuts | Kristina Hooper

“Despite widespread expectations of a global economic slowdown in 2024, growth and inflation have continued to perform above expectations across most major economies.”

Investor Anxiety Intensifies

Stock Market Crash Looming, But Not For The Reasons Most Analysts Think | Michael Harris

“High concentration, low breadth, higher inflation, a prolonged yield curve inversion, and even higher rates are not enough to cause a market crash.”

Can The Bull Market Keep On Kicking? Or Is It Growing Tired? The Answer May Surprise You | MarketGauge

“While the market has gone up well above expectations in H1 and may be due for a normal pullback or healthy correction, earnings have been stellar, earnings growth well above expectations, and the markets are fully expecting an easing from the Fed…”

Sentiment Speaks: As Bears Begin To Hibernate, It's Now Time To Worry About A Bear Market | Avi Gilburt

“When people get too bearish and sentiment hits a negative extreme, then everyone who has wanted to sell has sold, and there is only one direction left for the market to take. The same applies when the market gets too bullish.”

A Substantial Correction In Stock Prices Is Likely Coming Soon | BullBear Trading

“Predictions of a world-changing technology revolution led by AI and robotics, shifting to Intelligence Economics, are causing disruptions in stock pricing.”

The Soft Landing Lives, For Now | Claus Vistesen

“Markets are still enjoying a soft landing, defined as a world in which inflation is drifting lower, even if still-sticky in key areas, the global economy and labour markets remain unencumbered, and monetary policy is on track to ease modestly.”

Inflation Or The Economy - Which Breaks First? | Fear & Greed Trader

“It should be clear by now that inflation is still present, and at some point, markets will have to come to grips with reality and all it brings with it.”

This Doesn't End Well | Bret Jensen

“The huge rally off the lows of the last market swoon that ended late in October has also occurred against the backdrop of a clearly slowing economy. In fact, one could argue that much of the economy is already in recession.”

Deglobalization of Central Banks’ Policies

What I Expect After The Fed Cuts Rates In 2024 | Robert & Sam Kovacs

“In the past century, there are 4 post rate cut markets which should make investors shiver and fear the idea of investing in equities at all.”

Powell And The Fed Are More Hawkish Than You Think: Expect Economic Weakness Ahead | Logan Kane

“Between the lines, the Fed is likely worried about cutting rates too soon and stoking a bubble with assets already trading above their value relative to fundamentals.”

The Fed Can't Stop A Recession | James Foord

“History suggests there’s little the Central Bank can do to aid the real economy once the deleveraging cycle starts.”

What Does The Bank Of England's Delayed Rate Cut Imply For U.S.? | James Picerno

“If the Bank of England’s decision on Thursday to leave interest rates unchanged is a guide, the outlook for the start date for a US rate cut may be further down the line than generally assumed.”

Global Central Banks Queue Up Rate Cuts: Is It A Mistake? | Robert Brusca

“For two- or three-years central bankers have been exceeding their inflation targets consistently. And yet, central banks are now either executing or considering interest rate cuts for the period ahead.”

Seeking Alpha,https://seekingalpha.com/article/4702097-4-reasons-to-buy-uipath-stock?source=feed_all_articles,2024-07-02,17:49:40 UTC,4 Reasons To Buy UiPath Stock (NYSE:PATH),"ipuwadol

Introduction

Around 11 months back, we had written a relatively favorable article on UiPath Inc. (NYSE:PATH), a specialist in enterprise automation. While we had talked up the merits of the business, we were not convinced it was the right time to buy the stock and went with a HOLD rating.

In recent weeks, we’ve seen a strong retracement in the share price, and whilst there are some concerns over top management transition, and some transitory macroeconomic headwinds, we think the stock may be worth exploring at current levels, and choose to revise our rating to a BUY.

Here are some of the major themes supporting our BUY rating on the stock.

Adroitly Infusing AI and Automation

Given its roots in the RPA (Robotic Process Automation) space, PATH is still unfairly perceived in some quarters of the market to be only ensconced in that area. However, that is hardly the case, and in recent years, PATH has continued to recalibrate its automation approach by actually harnessing AI and thus developing superior capabilities.

One area worth highlighting is perhaps in document processing where it adroitly combines automation, specialized AI, and Gen AI, making it a leader in this space. Also note that PATH has cultivated its own large language model (LLM)-DocPATH, which is very effective in breaking down and parsing unstructured and lengthy documents such as legal documents, emails, etc. at large scale. In fact, compared to other Gen AI models, DocPath error rates are believed to be 45-76% lower. Client appetite for these document processing capabilities is huge, and exemplified by the fact that 65% of PATH’s new deals with their top 100 customers include IDP or Intelligent Document Processing.

Looking ahead, you could increasingly see PATH’s services being relied on for not just the automation of discrete tasks that could abet humans, but rather the carrying out of entire processes such as claims processing, etc.; these processes could first be described by natural languages, with an AI system, then executing based on that language, resulting in end-to-end process automation.

Attractive FCF Yield On Offer

Previously, while the PATH business did have intermittent periods of quarterly positive free cash flow (FCF) generation, it wasn’t until the January-2023 quarter (or Q4-23, in the case of PATH, as it follows a January year-ending calendar) when it commenced a period of consistent FCF generation.

Now for the last six quarters, PATH has not only generated positive FCF, but the cadence of FCF per quarter has also improved at a remarkable pace, with YoY growth of over 50% for two quarters on the trot! As a result, note that the stock, which has historically only averaged a marginal FCF yield of around 0.3%, is now yielding well over 4x that level at the current share price, making it an opportune time to dive in.

YCharts

Admittedly, there could be some question marks over the underlying quality of PATH’s FCF, as a large part of this involves adding back SBC (stock-based compensation) from net income, but do consider that in recent periods it has been growing at less than mid-single digits (in percentage terms), and over time, its share relative to total revenue has come off quite significantly (from close to 50% levels around three years back to around 26% currently).

YCharts

One of the other major drivers of FCF generation going forward will be PATH's ability to collect its receivables efficiently; note that there's scope to improve here, as the current days in sales outstanding (DSO) is at almost four months, and around 11% more than the 3-year average.

YCharts

All in all, looking ahead, we believe the above-average FCF yield is likely to linger through this year, as management is still on course to generate positive FCF of $300m for the FY, which would mark the second year running where they are able to cross this $300m landmark after years of no FCF.

Rock-Solid Liquidity Position Provides Support For A Pickup In Buybacks or Strategic M&A

Even without the positive FCF uplift (which is not the base case), note that this is a business that has mammoth levels of cash and short-term investments on its balance sheet, aggregating to nearly $2bn. To get a sense of how huge this is, do consider that it accounts for the largest share of the total asset base at 68%; also, dividing the cash and liquidity figure by the shares outstanding, gives you a figure of $3.66, which essentially accounts for 28% of the current share price! One typically associates such a high cash and liquidity component with defensive, mature companies that have reached their saturation point, not a growth entity like PATH, which highlights how valuable this facet is.

Since management has touched upon some large expansion opportunities getting postponed on account of the macroeconomic environment, there’s an opportunity for PATH to continue to trim its sales & marketing endeavors (as a function of revenue, this decline has already been rumbling along for a while now; see image below) and perhaps use some of those diverted marketing momentum in buying back the stock.

YCharts

Last September, the board initiated a $500m buyback program, but so far, deployment here hasn’t been too noteworthy with the pace of buybacks slowing in Q1. Given a more defensive deal environment, and the beaten-down share price, we expect the pace of buybacks to pick up from Q1 going forward.

YCharts

Alternatively, if they also have ample elbow room to engage in strategic M&A which could give them further technical clout in an AI-oriented enterprise automation environment; for context, the last time they carried out a strategic acquisition was two years ago, when they acquired Re:infer, an NLP software specialist which gave them an entry into the communications mining tech space.

Closing Thoughts - Favorable Mean-Reversion Potential and Valuation Picture

We also like what the technical and valuation sub-plots are currently suggesting.

The first chart highlights how bargain-hunters looking for beaten-down opportunities within the broad tech universe could have an eye on PATH now. PATH’s current relative strength ratio versus its tech peers is at record lows and around 68% off its mean.

YCharts

At these price levels, we feel PATH offers decent value, more so when you consider the medium-term earnings growth you’re getting, even after significant earnings revisions over the past three months.

Note that over the past three months, consensus EPS estimates for each of the next three years have been dialed down quite significantly (between -19% to -35%).

Seeking Alpha

Despite this hefty cut, the PATH business is still on course to deliver medium-term earnings CAGR of 21%, based on sell-side estimates.

YCharts

At the start of the year, this was a business priced at forward P/E multiples of 70x; now you can pick it up for half that rate at just 29x. That also translates to a pretty decent PEG (based on the medium-term EPS CAGR) of just 1.38x, which we think is a great deal for a high-growth tech stock.","ipuwadolIntroductionAround 11 months back, we had written a relatively favorable article on UiPath Inc.

VTI ETF: why we prefer it over SP500

In my last article on the Vanguard Total Stock Market Index Fund ETF Shares (NYSEARCA:VTI) (see the screenshot below), I analyzed the key reasons why I liked this total market fund better than funds indexed to the S&P 500 (SP500). The top reasons are valuation discount and growth potential, as summarized below:

The Vanguard Total Stock Market ETF offers advantages over the S&P 500 index due to its inclusion of mid and small-cap companies. The inclusion of mid and small-cap companies can provide exposure to higher growth potential at a much more reasonable valuation (even slightly discounted compared to the average in the past few years) compared to the S&P 500 index.

Seeking Alpha

In this article, I will provide two more thoughts based on the new developments since my last writing. These new developments are my updated outlook for interest rates and the updated valuation metrics given the price changes. As you will see, after analyzing the potential impacts of these changes, my conclusion is that VTI is still preferred over funds based on the SP500.

VTI ETF: the differences and why they matter

As a popular total market fund, VTI needs little introduction. So here I will just point out a few key differences that are directly relevant to the remainder of the discussion. The chart below summarizes the key features of the VTI funds compared to its peers such as Vanguard S&P 500 ETF (VOO), Vanguard S&P Mid-Cap 400 Index Fund ETF Shares (IVOO), and Vanguard S&P Small-Cap 600 Index Fund ETF Shares (VIOO). As seen, all ETFs have the same low expense ratio of 0.03%, a hallmark of Vanguard funds. The key difference is in the number of holdings. VTI tracks the total stock market, so it holds the most stocks (over 3,500) compared to the others which track a specific segment of the market (~500 for VOO, ~400 for IVOO, and ~600 for VIOO).

Vanguard

A key consequence of such different holdings is lower valuation risks in my mind. As argued in my earlier article, mid and small-cap companies were trading at a much more reasonable valuation than large caps yet offering similar (or even better) growth potential.

Since my last writing, SP500’s price has advanced even more than VTI (5.15% vs. 4.06% if you recall from the first chart above). It is bad news for VTI holders (such as me) that its performance dragged. However, looking ahead, such a price divergence further widened the valuation gap and made VTI’s valuation even more attractive. More specifically, the chart below summarizes the valuation metrics of VTI compared to VOO (and IVOO and VIOO too). As seen, in terms of P/E ratio, VTI’s P/E ratio of 25.1x is noticeably lower than VOO’s 26.1x. The root reason for such lower P/E is the attractive valuation ratio of the mid- and small-cap stock: IVOO has a P/E ratio of 18.2x and VIOO has a P/E ratio of 15.2x only. P/B ratios paint the same picture as seen.

Next, I will explain why a potential rate cut could benefit VTI more than VOO.

Vanguard

VTI ETF: potential impacts from a rate cut (or cuts)

Since my last writing, another key development involves the new CPI data (which was milder than before) and the new interest rate outlook. As illustrated by the chart below, the market expectations now imply much larger odds for rate cuts by 2024. To wit, my key observations from the following data provided by the CME Group FedWatch Tool are:

The current expectation implies the chance for rates to stay in the current range of 5.25% - 5.50% is much lower. The chance used to be 15% a month ago and now is only about 5%.

According to federal funds' futures contracts monitored by this tool, there is a dominant chance for rates to drop by at least 25 basis points. As just mentioned, the current expectation implies only a 5% chance for rates to remain put. In other words, there is a 95% chance for a rate cut (27% chance for a cut of 25 basis points and 68% chance for a cut of more than 25 basis points).

CME group

Of course, a rate cut most likely will benefit all equity funds and not only VTI. However, my view is that the stock prices of mid- and small-cap stocks can rise more than large caps in the case of a rate cut, thus leading to an outperformance for VTI. Mid- and small-size businesses typically rely more on borrowing money to fund their operations compared to large, established companies. This makes them more sensitive to interest rates.

When rates are cut, the cost of borrowing goes down, freeing up capital for small companies to invest in growth and potentially increasing their profitability. This can make their stocks more attractive to investors, driving their prices up more drastically. Furthermore, mid- and small-cap companies generally tend to have higher growth potential than large-cap companies. A rate cut often signals a stronger economic environment and more favorable conditions for these smaller businesses to expand, leading to a larger price increase.

Other risks and final thoughts

In terms of downside risks, as an index fund, VTI is heavily influenced by the overall economic conditions of the United States just like other market funds (and such influence is often called a systematic risk). Even though VTI offers broader diversification across the US stock market, the systematic risk that is inherent to the market can't be eliminated through diversification.

A second risk is valuation risk. The point I want to make in the second section is that VTI offers lower valuation risks relative to SP500, and the operative word is relative. VTI itself is expensively valued by historical standards. As an example, the chart below shows its valuation in terms of dividend yield. As seen, VTI's current dividend yield of 1.37% is significantly below its historical average of 1.68% in the past decade. Moreover, the current yield is also among the lowest levels in the past 10 years.

Seeking Alpha

All told, my conclusion is that VTI offers a better return/risk ratio compared to large-cap funds such as those indexed to the S&P 500. The top factors are the lower valuation risk and higher potential benefit in the case of a rate cut (which is a very likely scenario according to the updated market expectation). Finally, I do put my money where my mouth is. The chart below shows the current holding in my growth account (which follows a so-called barbell model, as detailed in our blog article). As seen, VTI is a core and large holding, representing almost 17.5% of the account.","These new developments are my updated outlook for interest rates and the updated valuation metrics given the price changes.

Precious metals traders and many market participants once called platinum, the rare precious metal, ""rich person's gold."" From the 1970s through 2010, platinum had commanded a significant premium over gold

Platinum prices (XPTUSD:CUR) reached its all-time high in 2008 at $2,308.80 and have not eclipsed the $2,000 level since that year. Platinum has not traded above $1,500 per ounce since 2014 and has spent nearly a decade trading around the $1,000 level. At the end of Q2 2024, the price was just below the $1,000 price pivot point.

Palladium prices (XPDUSD:CUR), meanwhile, exploded to a record $3,380.50 high in March 2022 when Russia invaded Ukraine. Russia and South Africa are the leading palladium-producing countries, supplying over 77.5% of the world's mine supplies. In 2023, out of 210 metric tons of output, Russia produced 92 tons, while South Africa's production was 71 tons. Meanwhile, palladium prices have plunged since March 2022 to below one-third the price at the high, with palladium closing Q2 2024 at under $1,000 per ounce.

The Sprott Physical Platinum and Palladium Trust (NYSEARCA:SPPP) invests nearly all its assets in physical platinum and palladium.

Palladium remained under pressure in Q2 2024

After reaching the record March 2022 high, NYMEX palladium futures reached lower lows in seven of the last nine quarters. While the precious and industrial metals did not make a lower low in Q2 2024, the price moved to the downside in the quarter that ended last week.

Ten-Year NYMEX Palladium Futures Chart (Barchart)

The monthly chart highlights Palladium's bearish that closed Q2 with a 4.27% loss and was 11.85% lower over the first half of 2024. Palladium posted an over 38% decline in 2023. Active month NYMEX September palladium futures were higher at the $1,019 per ounce level on July 2.

Platinum recovered, but the price is going nowhere fast

Platinum futures rallied 10.38% in Q2 and eked out a 0.69% gain over the first six months of 2024. However, platinum moved 7.33% lower in 2023.

Ten-Year NYMEX Platinum Futures Chart (Barchart)

The monthly chart shows that on July 2, nearby October NYMEX platinum futures were just over the $1,000 per ounce level.

Platinum and palladium were straddling the $1,000 level. While platinum was in a sideways trend, palladium's path of the least resistance remained bearish.

Gold and silver are in bull markets, leaving PGMs in the dust

While platinum was going nowhere in Q2, and palladium continued its descent, silver (XAGUSD:CUR) rose to its highest price since December 2012, and gold (XAUUSD:CUR) reached a record peak.

Long-Term COMEX Gold Futures Chart (Barchart)

The chart highlights gold's rise to $2,435.80 per ounce in May. Gold gained 5.51% in Q2 and was 12.93% higher over the first two quarters. Moreover, every dip in gold since the 1999 $252.50 bottom has been a buying opportunity.

Twenty-Year COMEX Silver Futures Chart (Barchart)

Silver broke through a technical resistance level, rising to a $32.50 per ounce high in May, the highest price in nearly a dozen years. Silver futures rallied 17.34% in Q2 and were 21.39% higher over the first half of this year. It has led the precious metals sector on the upside in Q2 and 2024.

Q2 was a tale of differing price action for precious metals, with gold and silver rallies and bearish and sideways PGM trends as platinum and palladium continued to search for bottoms. While palladium's price continued to melt, platinum went nowhere fast.

The case for platinum group metals over the coming months and years

From an investor's perspective, PGMs have been the dogs of the precious metals sector, but, as Shakespeare wrote in Hamlet, ""The cat will meow, and the dog will have his day.""

The following factors contribute to an eventual bullish recovery in the platinum and palladium futures markets:

Platinum and, to a greater extent, palladium are far less liquid than gold and silver. They have lower daily trading volumes and open interest, the total number of open long and short positions in the futures market. Less liquid markets tend to be more volatile. When platinum and palladium prices turn higher, offers to sell could evaporate, exacerbating price appreciation.

Russia is the leading palladium producer and the second-top platinum-producing country. As the war in Ukraine continues and relations with the U.S. and Europe deteriorate, tariffs, sanctions, and trade barriers could impact supplies and prices.

Platinum and palladium have a myriad of industrial applications, from green energy initiatives to electronics. Supply shortages could develop as global demand increases over the coming years.

Platinum and palladium are also investment metals. While their performance has lagged gold and silver, the higher the leading precious metals, the more investment demand could flow to the PGMs.

Bear markets can cause commodities to fall to illogical, unreasonable, and irrational levels that defy supply and demand fundamentals and frustrate the most patient investors. However, they will eventually reach unsustainable bottoms and reverse to the upside. Global inflation has increased production costs, which puts upside pressure on prices.

SPPP owns physical platinum and palladium and provides exposure in standard stock market accounts

The physical market for bars and coins is the most direct route for a platinum or palladium investment. However, the rare platinum group metals tend to command significant premiums, adding to costs. NYMEX platinum and palladium futures have physical delivery mechanisms but involve leverage because of margin requirements. Moreover, periodic illiquidity in these markets makes them challenging for even the most experienced market participants.

As the chart illustrates, SPPP has been trading since late 2012. The physical ETF reached a $21.59 high in May 2021 when NYMEX platinum prices peaked at $1,281.40 and palladium reached a $3,109 high. SPPP rose to a lower $21.05 high in March 2022 when palladium traded to a record $3,380.50 peak, and platinum reached a lower $1,197 high.

SPPP is under half the level at the 2021 and 2022 highs and could be on sale at under $10 per share.

iLearningEngines, Inc. (NASDAQ:AILE) is a recent de-SPAC that is down 26% since its listing. The company offers an AI-powered EdTech platform that positions it to benefit from the forecasted growth in the EdTech market that is fueled by the rise of AI. In fact, the market is forecasted to grow at a CAGR of 13.44% until 2030 to reach $348.41 billion. Given the company’s AI-first platform, I expect its market share to grow until 2030 and reach $1 billion in annual revenues in 2027, per my estimates. In light of its expected topline growth as well as its efficient cost structure, I’m rating iLearningEngines as a buy with a price target of $95 by 2030, representing 938% upside from current levels.

Company Overview

iLearningEngines provides an AI-powered learning and work automation platform to enterprises. The company’s platform uses AI to automate tasks involved in corporate training and development, including creating targeted training materials, streamlining content delivery, and personalizing the learning experience for employees. Moreover, the company’s platform can be used to analyze data to provide insights into learning effectiveness and employee performance. In this way, the platform allows companies to measure the impact of training programs and make data-driven decisions about their learning strategy.

On April 16th, iLearningEngines completed its SPAC merger with blank check company Arrowroot Acquisition Corp and started trading on the public market. Following the completion of the SPAC merger, the company entered into a revolving credit facility agreement with a principal amount of up to $40 million, with the potential to increase by an additional $20 million. iLearningEngines drew the full $40 million under the credit facility to bring the total gross proceeds from its SPAC deal to $92.8 million.

A portion of these funds were used to fully repay term loan credit facilities, and plans to use the rest of these proceeds to fund future growth opportunities. As of April 30th, iLearningEngines had cash and cash equivalents of around $28 million.

In Q1 2024, iLearningEngines reported an impressive 33% YoY revenue growth from $94 million to $124.9 million. At the same time, the company grew its annual recurring revenue ('ARR') by 34% YoY from $357.3 million to $478.9 million.

The main reason iLearningEngines is able to grow its topline at such a rapid pace is its impressive net revenue retention rate which highlights its ability to upsell its offerings to its existing customers. At the end of Q1, the company’s trailing 12-month NRR was 132% compared to 125% in the prior year. In comparison, other companies offering LMS and HCM solutions have the following NRR rates.

While iLearningEngines isn’t profitable on a GAAP basis yet, it reported adjusted net incomes of $6.8 million, $2.8 million, and $4 million in 2020, 2021, and 2022, respectively, as shared in its SPAC deck.

AILE's SPAC Deck

As for FY 2023, iLearningEngines reported a GAAP net loss of $4.4 million, impacted by a $14.1 million change in fair value of convertible notes charge. Without this charge, the company would have reported a net income of $9.7 million.

Net Loss -$4,407,000 Change in FV of Convertible Notes $14,147,000 Adjusted Net Income $9,740,000 Click to enlarge

Meanwhile, in Q1 2024, iLearningEngines posted a net loss of $25.9 million due to onetime charges of $15.1 million in changes in the fair value of warrants, $5.4 million in changes in the fair value of convertible notes, and $10 million in loss on debt extinguishment. Without these onetime charges, the company would have posted a net income of nearly $4.7 million.

Net Loss -$25,935,000 Change in FV of Warrants $15,118,000 Change in FV of Convertible Notes $5,465,000 Loss on Debt Extinguishment $10,041,000 Adjusted Net Income $4,689,000 Click to enlarge

iLearningEngines’ impressive bottom-line performance is mainly attributed to operating leverage. As is, the company’s revenues grew at a CAGR of 43.5% from 2020 to 2023, while R&D costs have been declining as a percentage of revenue since FY 2020, and SG&A costs have been declining as a % of revenue since FY 2021. Accordingly, the company’s operating margin has expanded from 3.53% at the end of FY 2021 to 4.05% at the end of FY 2023. This trend continued in Q1 2024, which in my opinion, could lead to further operating margin expansion in FY 2024.

Industry Tailwinds

The core of my bullish thesis on iLearningEngines is the forecasted growth in the EdTech market, as well as the company’s reliance on AI to provide its solutions. According to Grand View Research, the EdTech market grew from $89.49 billion in 2020 to $142.37 billion in 2023, growing at a CAGR of 16.74%. Grand View Research forecasts the market to reach $163.49 billion in 2024 and grow to $348.41 billion by 2030 at a CAGR of 13.44%.

The growth of the EdTech market, especially for enterprises which iLearningEngines is mainly focused on, is mainly due to the need of upskilling and reskilling workforce due to the rapid pace of technological changes. Traditional training methods are often time-consuming and inflexible, which can make it hard to integrate these programs into employees’ busy work schedules. In contrast, EdTech platforms offer this required flexibility due to their scalable solutions for delivering targeted training programs to employees.

Moreover, EdTech platforms can provide engaging learning experiences that enhance employee satisfaction and development through personalized learning paths and micro learning modules. These methods can make training more interactive and effective, which is extremely beneficial to enterprises.

The rise of AI is also critical for the growth of the EdTech market, especially for enterprises, due to its ability to provide personalized learning experiences and optimized content, and analyze data for continuous employee improvement. AI can personalize training programs for each employee based on their role, past performance data, and progress within the program, while creating learning modules that can fit into the employees’ work schedules. This can help enterprises provide their employees the most relevant training, while maximizing the effectiveness and efficiency of these training programs.

AI can also conduct predictive analysis on enterprise data to identify potential skill gaps within the workforce and predict future skill needs based on industry trends. In this way, enterprises could proactively develop training programs and ensure their employees have the required skills for their roles within their enterprises. As such, AI-driven EdTech platforms, like iLearningEngines, could benefit the most from the forecasted growth of the EdTech market.

Revenue Projections

Knowing this information, I expect iLearningEngines’ market share in the EdTech market to increase in the coming years thanks to its early focus and integration of AI into its platform. According to Grand View Research’s forecast of the EdTech market, iLearningEngines’ market share grew from 0.16% in 2020 to 0.29% in 2023.

Year EdTech Market Size AILE Revenue Market Share Market Share Growth Revenue Growth 2020 $89,490,000,000 $141,753,218 0.16% 2021 $104,470,000,000 $217,867,690 0.21% 32% 53.70% 2022 $121,960,000,000 $308,895,350 0.25% 21% 41.78% 2023 $142,370,000,000 $418,557,906 0.29% 16% 35.50% Click to enlarge

Accordingly, my assumptions for its market share growth until 2030 are as follows.

16% market share growth in 2024.

14% market share growth in 2025 and 2026.

12% market share growth in 2027 and 2028.

10% market share growth in 2029 and 2030.

I’m assuming iLearningEngines’ market share growth will decelerate due to competition from several large companies such as Microsoft (MSFT), SAP (SAP), and Oracle (ORCL) who already offer EdTech solutions to enterprises.

Based on my assumptions, I’m forecasting iLearningEngines’ revenues until 2030 to be as follows.

Year EdTech Market Size AILE Revenue Market Share Market Share Growth Revenue Growth 2024 $163,490,000,000 $557,553,116 0.34% 16% 33.21% 2025 $185,400,000,000 $720,791,464 0.39% 14% 29.28% 2026 $210,240,000,000 $931,794,418 0.44% 14% 29.27% 2027 $238,410,000,000 $1,183,442,732 0.50% 12% 27.01% 2028 $270,360,000,000 $1,503,083,957 0.56% 12% 27.01% 2029 $306,590,000,000 $1,874,957,692 0.61% 10% 24.74% 2030 $348,410,000,000 $2,343,779,674 0.67% 10% 25.00% Click to enlarge

My forecast implies that iLearningEngines’ revenues will grow at a CAGR of 27% from 2024 to 2030, compared to the EdTech industry’s CAGR of 13.44%.

Valuation

According to the company’s latest Q1 earnings, iLearningEngines has a cash balance of $28 million and has debt of $115.8 million. The company’s debt includes $26 million in CPLTD, $37.7 million in convertible debt which was converted into shares following the SPAC merger, per the S1 filing, $49.8 million in subordinated payables to a technology partner, as well as the latest $40 million credit facility.

*Data compiled from iLearningEngines’ S1 filing and Q1 results.

Accordingly, iLearningEngines has an enterprise value of $1.32 billion at the current share price of $9.14. Per my revenue projections, iLearningEngines would be trading at the following forward EV/sales multiples.

Year Revenue EV EV/Sales 2024 $557,553,116 $1,321,444,842 2.37 2025 $720,791,464 $1,321,444,842 1.83 2026 $931,794,418 $1,321,444,842 1.42 2027 $1,183,442,732 $1,321,444,842 1.12 2028 $1,503,083,957 $1,321,444,842 0.88 2029 $1,874,957,692 $1,321,444,842 0.70 2030 $2,343,779,674 $1,321,444,842 0.56 Click to enlarge

In my opinion, these multiples indicate that iLearningEngines is undervalued at its current valuation, considering that other LMS and HCM companies are trading at the following forward EV/sales multiples.

Company EV/Sales DCBO 5.04 WDAY 6.41 PCTY 5.03 PAYC 4.07 INST 6.96 Average 5.50 Click to enlarge

In my opinion, iLearningEngines is trading at such a discount to other HCM and LMS equities due to its listing through a SPAC. Over the past few years, market sentiment surrounding SPACs have turned negative due to the number of unsuccessful SPAC mergers and high redemptions. In fact, iLearningEngines’ merger has seen 85% of the SPAC’s shares redeemed, per the S1 filing.

That said, I believe iLearningEngines’ valuation could catch up with industry peers thanks to its offering. The company’s AI-powered platform offers several benefits to its users, as mentioned earlier, and these benefits could help it attract more customers, in my opinion.

As such, I expect the company’s Q2 earnings report to attract more investors to the company’s stock, since it would mark iLearningEngines’ first 10-Q filing as a public company. It should be noted that the 10-Q filed on May 16th, doesn't reflect iLearningEngines' financial performance in Q1 2024 as a result of the SPAC deal closing on April 16th.

10-Q Filing

In light of this, I’m applying a 5.5 EV/sales multiple to iLearningEngines, the average multiple of industry peers, to reach my price targets for the stock until 2030 as follows.

Own Calculations

Please note that I used EV/sales instead of EV/EBITDA to reach my price target for iLearningEngines due to the EdTech industry being in its early growth stages and any meaningful developments in the use of AI in the industry could see the company increasing its R&D costs to keep up with market demand.

Risks

Since the core of my bullish thesis on iLearningEngines is its potential future growth due to its AI-powered platform, the main risk to my thesis is the company’s revenue concentration. In FY 2023, the company generated 63.4% of its revenues from its top 4 customers. Since losing any of those customers could represent a major blow to the company’s growth prospects, iLearningEngines should work to add more customers to its platform in order to lessen the impact in case it loses any of its top 4 customers.

Conclusion

In conclusion, I’m bullish on iLearningEngines due to its future growth potential. The company’s AI-powered EdTech platform could allow it to benefit substantially from the forecasted EdTech market growth, which is expected to reach $348.41 billion by 2030. As is, AI plays a critical role in the EdTech industry’s growth, especially for enterprises, due to its ability to provide personalized learning experiences and optimized content, and analyze data for continuous employee improvement.

In addition to the industry tailwinds, iLearningEngines is benefitting from operating leverage with R&D costs and SG&A costs declining as a percentage of revenues since FY 2021 and FY 2022, respectively. This has allowed the company to expand its operating margin over the past 3 years, and appears to be on track to achieve this in FY 2024 based on its Q1 results. In light of these factors, I’m rating iLearningEngines as a buy with a price target of $95 by 2030, representing 938% upside from its current valuation.","In Q1 2024, iLearningEngines reported an impressive 33% YoY revenue growth from $94 million to $124.9 million.

Tesla Q2 deliveries handily top expectations. (0:15) Fed's Powell sees disinflation resuming. (1:43) Disney content set for a 'major turnaround'? (4:28)

This is an abridged transcript of the podcast:

Our top story so far. Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) rallied with shares approaching a 2024 high after it reported 443,956 deliveries for Q2, beating expectations of a little more than 439,000 vehicles.

Most of Tesla's sales came from the smaller and cheaper Models 3 and Y lines, with the company selling only 21,551 of its more expensive models that include X and S, as well as the new Cybertruck.

Wedbush Securities analyst Dan Ives said Q2 was a huge comeback performance from Tesla and CEO Elon Musk, with the Street expecting a clear miss this quarter amid choppy EV demand. Ives reiterated that Wedbush sees the automaker as more of an AI and robotics play than a traditional car company.

Meanwhile, CFRA analyst Garrett Nelson noted that TSLA continues to ride a wave of positive momentum following its annual meeting in June, at which shareholders re-approved Musk's 2018 compensation plan.

""At the meeting, we think Musk successfully shifted investor focus to long-term opportunities in AI, robotics, energy storage, and other business lines, diverting attention away from near-term challenges,"" he said.

In addition, Rivian Automotive (RIVN) said it produced 9,612 vehicles at its manufacturing facility in Normal, Illinois, during Q2 and delivered 13,790 vehicles during the period. The EV maker said that was in line with expectations, and management reaffirmed full-year guidance for annual production of 57,000 total vehicles.

Turning to the economy, Fed Chairman Jay Powell said there are signs that consumer prices are resuming their path of disinflation.

While trying to strike his usual balance, his remarks at the Forum on Central Banking in Portugal leaned a little dovish. He said that he would like to see more data like the recent figures to be comfortable cutting, but also said the risks between inflation and the labor market are coming into “better balance.”

“We’re getting a gradually cooling economy, a gradually cooling labor market, progress on inflation, 4% unemployment, and 2% growth. We’re getting kind of what we want to have,” Powell said.

Following the event, expectations for a quarter-point rate cut in September rose about 5 percentage points. Fed funds futures are now pricing in about a 70% chance that rates are lower after that meeting. Chances of three cuts by the end of 2024 moved back above 20%.

Looking at today’s data, it’s still a labor market that just won’t quit. The May Job Openings and Labor Turnover Survey, or JOLTS, showed openings at 8.1 million, higher than forecast and up from a downwardly revised 7.9 million in April.

The quits rate stayed steady at 2.2%, and the layoff rate stayed steady at 1%.

Raymond James' Chief Economist Eugenio Aleman notes, ""The largest decline in job openings occurred in the leisure and hospitality sector as job openings in the accommodation and food services sector declined by 147,000 job openings. It is clear that state and local governments are bucking the overall job opening trend and contributed to an increase in job openings in May compared to the previous month.""

Citi downgraded home builders Lennar (LEN) and D.R. Horton (DHI) to Neutral from Buy on softening housing activity this summer. Citi said it sees limited near-term catalysts for the stocks until 2025, with September rate cuts at least partially priced in.

Susquehanna Financial upgraded PayPal (PYPL) to Positive from Neutral on valuation, with a price target of $71. Analyst James Friedman is positive on PYPL making profitable growth a top priority.

And Bank of America reiterated a bullish view on Disney (DIS). Analyst Jessica Reif Ehrlich says she believes Disney will outperform peers in 2024 as a result of recent price increases across the Disney+/Hulu/ESPN+ universe, strong advertiser demand for the recently launched ad-supported tier on Disney+, cost discipline across the direct-to-consumer business, and continued robust theme park demand with several levers for future growth.

Crucially, she also thinks the content slate is showing signs of a turnaround after Inside Out 2 surpassed $1 billion at the global box office in its first three weeks. Disney is trying to strike a better balance of originals and leveraging IP with the studio business.

And speaking of amusement parks, a combined Six Flags Entertainment—symbol (FUN)—started trading today following the closing of the merger between Cedar Fair and Six Flags late on Monday.

The new theme park operator will control dozens of theme parks, water parks, and resort properties across the U.S., as well as Canada and Mexico. The boosted geographic mix may help smooth out the impact of severe weather events on earnings. The newly formed company will have its headquarters in Charlotte, North Carolina.

CEO Richard Zimmerman says, ""Our enhanced financial flexibility will enable us to invest in new rides, attractions, food and beverage options, and state-of-the-art consumer technologies, ensuring continuous improvement and innovation and that each park visit is more exciting and memorable than the last.""

Ahead of the closing, Morgan Stanley said it is bullish on Six Flags, even with both stocks up at least 30% on a year-to-date basis. Analyst Thomas Yeh expects synergies and a revenue catch-up opportunity to support high single-digit EBITDA growth and valuation upside.

Morgan Stanley's Overweight rating is underpinned by the view that the current valuation still under-appreciates the growth potential of the pro forma company. Yeh and his team see opportunities for the new company to continue executing on an attendance recovery within the legacy Six Flags footprint.

Meanwhile, Wall Street Breakfast readers weighed in with what they thought would be the best-performing S&P stock in the second half of the year.

Nvidia (NVDA) was the clear winner, with 31% of the more than 500 responses to the survey. Other big AI names also scored silver and bronze, with Microsoft (MSFT) and Apple (AAPL) receiving 8% and 6% of the total vote, respectively.

Amazon (AMZN), Alphabet (GOOG), and Super Micro Computer (SMCI) rounded out the list.

And in the Wall Street Research Corner

BofA Securities is out with a new list of 10 short-term stock recommendations for the third quarter in nine industries.

Strategist Anthony Cassamassino says the list of nine Buys and one Underperform are believed to have “significant market and business-related catalysts in the quarter ahead.”

Among the Buys are General Aerospace (GE), which is “strongly positioned to benefit from secular commercial aerospace growth,” Goldman Sachs, which has “a compelling risk/reward to gain exposure to a cyclical rebound in investment banking activity,” and Palantir (PLTR), which is “at the early stages of its network effect, as each additional user brings tremendous value to the connected network.”

The one Sell idea is CarMax (KMX), as “the sourcing environment for used cars is still challenging, especially for late model used vehicles,” a dynamic that will likely continue through 2025 and onwards, “which should hinder CarMax’s same-store unit growth.”","Looking at today’s data, it’s still a labor market that just won’t quit.

The approval cleared construction of 195 wind turbines as part of the project, although the JV had sought up to 200.

The project still requires an additional federal approval of its construction and operations plan, along with two state-level permits, before construction can begin.

Sales in late June were also slowed by disruptions at car dealers stemming from a cyberattack on a company that supplies software and data services to dealerships.

Cox Automotive, a market research firm, estimated that 4.1 million new cars and trucks were sold in the second quarter, up a little from the same period in 2023. In the first six months of 2024, 7.9 million new vehicles were sold, an increase of 3 percent from the first half of last year, Cox said.

Slow growth is likely to continue through the rest of the year, with consumers delaying big-ticket purchases until after the election, said Jonathan Smoke, Cox’s chief economist. “The market is roiled by uncertainty,” he said. “We probably can’t quite keep the pace of sales of the first half, but we aren’t expecting a collapse in sales, either.”","Most automakers on Tuesday, with the exception of Tesla, reported modest sales growth in the three months between April and June as high interest rates, persistently high vehicle prices, and uncertainty about the economy and the coming presidential election weighed on consumers.

Trump took to social media to share one of his central economic philosophies: “Trade wars are good, and easy to win.”

As president, Mr. Trump presided over the biggest increase in U.S. tariffs since the Great Depression, hitting China, Canada, the European Union, Mexico, India and other governments with stiff levies. They hit back, imposing tariffs on American soybeans, whiskey, orange juice and motorcycles. U.S. agricultural exports plummeted, prompting Mr. Trump to send $23 billion to farmers to help offset losses.

Now, as he runs for president again, Mr. Trump is promising to ratchet up his trade war to a much greater degree. He has proposed “universal baseline tariffs on most foreign products,” including higher levies on certain countries that devalue their currency. In interviews, he has floated plans for a 10 percent tariff on most imports and a tariff of 60 percent or more on Chinese goods. He has also posited cutting the federal income tax and relying on tariffs for revenue instead.

Mr. Trump, who once proclaimed himself “Tariff Man,” has long argued that tariffs would boost American factories, end the gap between what America imported and what it exported and increase American jobs.","They hit back, imposing tariffs on American soybeans, whiskey, orange juice and motorcycles.

Trump boil down to economics.

Inflation, immigration, government taxing and spending, interest rates, and trade relationships could all take center stage — and both candidates could make sweeping claims about them, as they regularly do at campaign events and other public appearances.

Given that, it could be handy to go into the event with an understanding of where the economic data stand now and what the latest research says. Below is a rundown of some of today’s hot-button topics and the context you need to follow along like a pro.

And probably none are more prolific in broadcasting their political views on social media.

But as Mr. Musk’s public persona has become increasingly right wing, Tesla appears to be paying a price in sales, especially to liberal and left-leaning customers who are much more likely to buy battery-powered cars than conservatives are, according to analysts and many car owners who responded to a questionnaire on The New York Times’s website about whether his behavior affected their views of Tesla.

His image as an erratic, impulsive manager appear to have rubbed off on the cars, raising doubts in some people’s minds about their quality and helping to explain why Tesla sales have been falling. On Tuesday, the company reported that its global sales in the second quarter fell 4.8 percent from the same period a year earlier, after an 8.5 percent drop in the first three months of the year.

“Musk is a true lightning rod,” said Ben Rose, the president of Battle Road Research, which has a generally positive view on Tesla’s stock. “There are people who swear by him and people who swear at him. No question, some of his comments are a real turnoff for some people. For a subset, enough to buy another brand.”","Few auto executives are as closely identified with the companies they manage as Elon Musk, the chief executive of Tesla, is.

Eight-figure pay packages — rare a decade ago — are increasingly common for corporate lawyers at the top of their game, and many of these new heavy hitters have one thing in common: private equity.

In recent years, highly profitable private equity giants like Apollo, Blackstone and KKR have moved beyond company buyouts into real estate, private lending, insurance and other businesses, amassing trillions of dollars in assets. As their demand for legal services has skyrocketed, they have become big revenue drivers for law firms.

This is pushing up lawyers’ pay across the industry, including at some of Wall Street’s most prestigious firms, such as Kirkland & Ellis; Simpson Thacher & Bartlett; Davis Polk; Latham & Watkins; and Paul, Weiss, Rifkind, Wharton & Garrison. Lawyers with close ties to private equity increasingly enjoy pay and prestige similar to those of star lawyers who represent America’s blue-chip companies and advise them on high-profile mergers, takeover battles and litigation.","Hotshot Wall Street lawyers are now so in demand that bidding wars between firms for their services can resemble the frenzy among teams to sign star athletes.

That frees the administration to cut certain borrowers’ payments by as much as half, a benefit that had been previously scheduled but blocked.

The order, from the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 10th Circuit in Denver, is the latest twist in a saga that began to unfold last week after two federal judges temporarily suspended parts of the plan known as SAVE. That program, which has about eight million enrollees, ties borrowers’ monthly payment amounts to their income and household size.

Two judges, one in Kansas and another in Missouri, last Monday issued separate preliminary injunctions, which are tied to lawsuits that were filed in the spring by two groups of Republican-led states that seek to upend the SAVE program.

The Kansas order suspended parts of the program that were not yet in place, including a big decrease in monthly payments for people with undergraduate debt — to 5 percent of their discretionary income from 10 percent — which was to take effect on July 1. The judge in Missouri blocked new debt cancellation through the SAVE program, though legal experts initially said it wasn’t clear how widely that ruling should be interpreted.","Major components of President Biden’s student loan repayment plan can continue to operate as lawsuits challenging it wind through the legal system, a federal appellate court ruled on Sunday.

Others have also expressed interest in acquiring National Amusements, including the media and finance executive Edgar Bronfman Jr. and Steven Paul, the Hollywood executive best known for his work on the “Baby Geniuses” franchise.

A bid to take control of Paramount would be a coda of sorts for Mr. Diller, 82, who tried to acquire Paramount Pictures in the early ’90s. He was outbid by Sumner Redstone, the bellicose media mogul whose daughter, Shari, now controls the company.

Mr. Diller was named head of Paramount Pictures in 1974 at the age of 32. He was credited with rejuvenating the studio, developing a cadre of talented lieutenants, like the future Disney chief executive Michael Eisner and the studio wunderkind Jeffrey Katzenberg, that became known as the Killer Dillers.

After Mr. Redstone outbid him for the company, Mr. Diller set his sights on continuing to build his new media empire, striking a series of audacious deals to expand IAC.

“They won,” Mr. Diller said in a statement after losing out to Mr. Redstone. “We lost. Next.”

National Amusements began exploring potential deals last year. As part of its talks with Skydance, Shari Redstone, the largest shareholder at National Amusements, would sell the company to Skydance, while Paramount would merge with Skydance through a separate transaction. That deal was scuttled after they could not agree on noneconomic terms after significant shareholder pushback.","It’s unclear how far along the talks between IAC and National Amusements are.

The program, “The Trial of Hunter Biden,” which first appeared in 2022 on Fox Nation, the network’s streaming service, presented a dramatized version of a criminal trial of Mr. Biden, with fictional charges. The mini-series integrated real-life images of Mr. Biden in the nude and engaged in sex acts, imagery that was discovered on a laptop that Mr. Biden abandoned at a computer repair shop in Delaware.

The lawsuit, filed in New York Supreme Court in Manhattan, accuses Fox of violating a so-called revenge porn law in New York State that was passed in 2019. The law allows people to sue anyone who shares their sexually explicit photos and videos without permission.

“Fox published and disseminated these intimate images to its vast audience of millions as part of an entertainment program in order to humiliate, harass, annoy and alarm Mr. Biden and to tarnish his reputation,” the lawsuit states.","President Biden’s son Hunter Biden sued Fox News on Sunday, arguing that a mini-series produced by the company broke the law by sharing explicit photos and videos of him without his permission.

In buying Spirit, Boeing hopes to stem quality problems that have plagued the supplier in recent years. While it already has significant influence over Spirit, Boeing will more easily be able to monitor and change production practices by owning the business. Boeing has taken internal steps to improve quality, too, after a harrowing incident in which a panel blew out of one of its planes on a flight in January.

“By reintegrating Spirit,” Boeing’s chief executive, Dave Calhoun, said in a statement, the company “can fully align” its production and safety systems with its work force.

The deal, which was widely expected, was valued at $4.7 billion in stock or $8.3 billion including Spirit’s debt. It is subject to approval by regulators and Spirit’s shareholders. Boeing will also spin off portions of Spirit to Airbus, its European rival, as part of the transaction.

Under the change, which took effect Monday, parents are able to transfer a portion of their parental leave days to other caretakers, cementing Sweden’s reputation as a global trendsetter in progressive parental leave policies.

The law enables single parents to transfer up to 90 days of paid leave to other caregivers and a parental couple to transfer up to 45 days, according to the Swedish government’s Social Insurance Agency.

The law was approved by the Riksdag, Sweden’s 349-seat parliament, last December.

He declared it was going to be a “white boy summer.”

Whatever exactly he meant at the time, the phrase has since mutated into a slogan for white supremacists and other hate, according to a report published on Tuesday by the Global Project Against Hate and Extremism, an organization that tracks the spread of racism.

Thousands of posts using the slogan “white boy summer” have appeared on the Telegram app this year. It’s been used by far-right groups to recruit new followers, organize protests and encourage violence, especially against immigrants and L.G.B.T.Q. people, the report said.

For many of those who use it now, the phrase represents an unapologetic embrace of white heterosexual masculinity, often at the expense of women and people of color.","In the spring of 2021, Chet Hanks, the singer, actor and son of Tom, posted a series of statements and a music video with a refrain that caused confusion, not to mention a fair bit of cringing.

The drug, donanemab, to be sold under the brand name Kisunla, was shown in studies to modestly slow the pace of cognitive decline in early stages of the disease. It also had significant safety risks, including swelling and bleeding in the brain.

Kisunla, made by Eli Lilly, is similar to another drug, Leqembi, approved last year. Both are intravenous infusions that attack a protein involved in Alzheimer’s, and both can slow the unfolding of dementia by several months. Both also carry similar safety risks. Leqembi, made by Eisai and Biogen, is given every two weeks; Kisunla is given monthly.

Kisunla has a significant difference that may appeal to patients, doctors and insurers: Lilly says patients can stop the drug after it clears the protein, amyloid, which clumps into plaques in the brains of people with Alzheimer’s.","The Food and Drug Administration on Tuesday approved a new drug for Alzheimer’s disease, the latest in a novel class of treatments that has been greeted with hope, disappointment and skepticism.

Powell, the chair of the Federal Reserve, said that inflation was once again coming down in the United States and that the Fed had “made quite a bit of progress” in cooling price increases back toward its goal.

Inflation “now shows signs of resuming its disinflationary trend,” Mr. Powell said on Tuesday at the European Central Bank’s annual conference in Sintra, Portugal. It was an optimistic message after the Fed’s fight against inflation hit a speed bump earlier this year.

Fed officials have been waiting to see further progress on inflation before they begin to lower interest rates, which are currently set to their highest level in decades, at 5.3 percent. Mr. Powell declined to say exactly when officials could begin to cut borrowing costs, but suggested that they could lower rates if inflation data continued on its current track or if the labor market weakened.

“What we’d like to see is more data like what we’ve been seeing recently,” Mr. Powell said, later adding, “We have the ability to take our time and get this right.”","Inflation “now shows signs of resuming its disinflationary trend,” Mr. Powell said on Tuesday at the European Central Bank’s annual conference in Sintra, Portugal.

This new deal is like other international projects the Trump family has signed over the past decade. It offers the family’s name and brand to a well-financed developer that will build the project and sell luxury resident units, it hopes at a premium, based on the marketability of the former president’s perceived star power. Other projects include a resort complex in Oman and Saudi-backed golf tournaments at Trump courses in recent years.

The ruling in the case — the latest in a series of challenges to administrative power this term — could amplify the effect of the blockbuster decision last week overturning a foundational legal precedent known as Chevron deference, which required federal courts to defer to agencies’ reasonable interpretations of ambiguous statutes. That decision imperils countless regulations, particularly on the environment, and advances a longstanding goal of the conservative legal movement.

The vote was 6 to 3, split along ideological lines. Justice Amy Coney Barrett, writing for the conservative majority, rejected the government’s argument that the time limit to sue begins when an agency issues a rule.

Under the government’s view, she wrote, “only those fortunate enough to suffer an injury within six years of a rule’s promulgation” could sue. She added, “Everyone else — no matter how serious the injury or how illegal the rule — has no recourse.”","The Supreme Court on Monday gave companies more time to challenge many regulations, ruling that a six-year statute of limitations for filing lawsuits begins when a regulation first affects a company rather than when it is first issued.

Says","When Meta introduced a subscription option last year that would allow users in the European Union to pay for an advertising-free experience of Instagram and Facebook, it was meant to fix regulatory problems the company faced in the region.

The plan created new legal headaches instead.

On Monday, European Union regulators said Meta’s subscription, which costs up to 12.99 euros a month, amounted to a “pay or consent” scheme that required users to choose between paying a fee or handing over more personal data to Meta to use for targeted advertising.

Meta introduced the subscription last year as a way to address regulatory and legal scrutiny of its advertising-based business model. Of most concern was the company’s combination of data collected about users across its different platforms — including Facebook, Instagram and WhatsApp — along with information pulled from other websites and apps.

Meta argued that by offering a subscription, users had a fair alternative.

But regulators on Monday said the system was no choice at all, forcing users to pay for privacy. The authorities said Meta’s policy violated the Digital Markets Act, a new law aimed at reining in the power of the biggest tech companies.","When Meta introduced a subscription option last year that would allow users in the European Union to pay for an advertising-free experience of Instagram and Facebook, it was meant to fix regulatory problems the company faced in the region.

The shock waves from last week’s presidential debate are still reverberating, as President Biden and his aides sought to allay concerns from despondent Democrats and wealthy donors about his age and fitness for office.

Donors are increasingly becoming reconciled to Biden remaining the Democratic nominee even after Biden’s disastrous performance. But some in the party, and in the markets, are increasingly expecting Donald Trump to win in November.

Here’s the latest fallout from the debate. Seventy-two percent of registered voters don’t believe Biden has the mental and cognitive health to serve as president, according to a CBS News poll published Sunday, compared with 65 percent in early June.

With the odds for a Trump win rising after the debate, Wall Street analysts are recalculating what that could mean for the economy and the markets. Among their forecasts are a slowdown in growth and resurgence in inflation that could muddle the Fed’s interest rate policy, especially if Trump carries out his proposals for mass deportation of undocumented migrants and higher tariffs.","Donors still on edgeThe shock waves from last week’s presidential debate are still reverberating, as President Biden and his aides sought to allay concerns from despondent Democrats and wealthy donors about his age and fitness for office.

Now She’s a Labor Boss.,"Brooke Shields has a new office. It’s empty, and she hasn’t figured out how she wants to furnish it, or even how often she’ll be there, but it’s a sign of her new and unexpected status, as president of Actors’ Equity Association, the labor union representing theater actors and stage managers in the United States.

Shields’s candidacy was a surprise, even to herself. But when Kate Shindle, who had led the union for nine years, announced in April that she was stepping down, Shields’s music director suggested she consider the opening, and soon enough, she had tossed her hat in the ring, and in May she won the vote by members, defeating two more-seasoned labor activists. She’s already led her first meeting of the union’s council, and came away realizing she has a lot to learn, starting with parliamentary procedure.

Shields, of course, is one of those people who has been famous for so long, and in so many ways, that even she can’t remember a different time. She was a childhood model, a preteen movie star, a sex object and an icon of beauty, all before she went off to college (Princeton, thank you very much). In the years since, she has acted onscreen and onstage, has written books, has spoken widely, particularly about depression, and has become a symbol and a subject for an evolving discussion about how women and girls have been sexualized by the entertainment and fashion industries.","Brooke Shields has a new office.

It’s Not Enough.,"Four months ago, China’s leaders announced what seemed like a straightforward and proven plan to recharge the economy: Subsidize consumers who want to replace old cars and household appliances.

The early results are not promising.

Only 113,000 cars qualified for trade-in subsidies through June 25 — a blip in a country where monthly sales exceed two million cars. And buyers of new appliances such as washing machines and refrigerators are being offered discounts of only about 10 percent, depending on what city they live in.

The incentives are not enough to bring customers into stores.

“If it is not needed, people will not go out of their way to find an old machine to participate,” said Dai Yu, the manager of an appliance store in Jingdezhen, a city in Jiangxi Province in south-central China.

The idea of providing financial incentives to spur consumer spending is not new.

In 2009, the United States, Germany, France, Spain and Austria offered so-called cash for clunkers programs to revive car sales. They paid households to scrap gas guzzlers and replace them with newer cars with better fuel economy. China itself gave extensive tax cuts and subsidies for consumers to buy new cars and household appliances. Prices for many appliances were cut in half, particularly for rural residents, and sales surged.","Four months ago, China’s leaders announced what seemed like a straightforward and proven plan to recharge the economy: Subsidize consumers who want to replace old cars and household appliances.

We don’t yet have “Madoff: The Musical,” but years after his 2021 death from kidney disease in a federal prison hospital, Bernie the Ponzi-scheming potentate keeps yielding cultural dividends. An experimental film shown at Lincoln Center. A Netflix documentary series, “The Monster of Wall Street.” And now, adding to a fat stack that includes a coloring book and an exposé by a New York Times reporter that generated its own Robert De Niro movie, a new prose probe entitled “Madoff: The Final Word.”

Final? As its own author, Richard Behar, admits: doubtful.

A longtime investigative journalist who has taken on, among other formidable institutions, the litigious Church of Scientology, Behar spent 15 years seemingly half-shackled to and half-tickled by this, his first book. Along with many, many secondary interviews, he visited Madoff in prison thrice; talked to him on the phone about 50 times; and received from him dozens of handwritten letters and hundreds of emails.(He’s far from the first or only reporter to have visited the man in the clink, but the passage of time has loosened some auxiliary tongues — though death has stilled others.)

For every dollar he stole, Madoff seems to have generated at least one piece of regular paper. The hoard of 30 million documents he didn’t manage to destroy, Behar writes, “is nearly half the size of the printed material collection of the U.S. Library of Congress.” The shredding operation Madoff ran starting in the mid-90s, in a Brooklyn facility now called Tuck-It-Away, was like an A.S.M.R. orgy: burlap bags of the scraps taken to a nearby recycling plant, his secrets “dissolving to mulch.”","MADOFF: The Final Word, by Richard BeharWe don’t yet have “Madoff: The Musical,” but years after his 2021 death from kidney disease in a federal prison hospital, Bernie the Ponzi-scheming potentate keeps yielding cultural dividends.

Scientists failed to find evidence that the virus can spread as a respiratory infection. Juergen Richt, a virologist at Kansas State University who helped lead the research, said that the results suggested that the virus is mainly infectious via contaminated milking machines.

In an interview, Dr. Richt said that the results offered hope that the outbreak could be halted before the virus evolved into a form that could spread readily between humans.

“I think this is good news that we can most likely control it easier than people thought,” Dr. Richt said. “Hopefully we can now kick this thing in the behind and knock it out.”","Ever since scientists discovered influenza infecting American cows earlier this year, they have been puzzling over how it spreads from one animal to another.

She spent summers getting ready to show cattle at the county fair. During the school year, she rushed home after class to feed the chickens on her family’s corn and soybean farm. Neither of her parents went to college, but they encouraged their daughter when she decided to go to Carleton, a liberal arts school a two-hour drive from their farm in Minnesota.

Despite being physically close to home, Ms. Lunz Trujillo was surprised by how foreign her upbringing seemed at the college. She was dismayed when she checked out the farm club and learned that its members wanted to brew kombucha, not milk cows. When an art history teacher asked students which famous paintings they’d seen in person, Ms. Lunz Trujillo stayed quiet, because she had never been to an art museum. This sense of cultural alienation molded her research when she became a political scientist: What is rural identity? How does it shape a person’s politics?

Ms. Kaplan was already famous when she founded her law firm in 2017, having won a landmark Supreme Court case that paved the way for marriage equality for gay Americans. The firm soon gained national prominence because of her leadership in the #MeToo movement, and more recently for high-profile victories against white supremacists and former President Donald J. Trump.

But those triumphs couldn’t overcome an uncomfortable reality, according to people familiar with the law firm’s internal dynamics.

In the eyes of many of her colleagues, including the firm’s two other named partners, Ms. Kaplan’s poor treatment of other lawyers — ranging from micromanagement to vulgar insults and humiliating personal attacks — was impairing the boutique firm she had built, the people said. For one thing, they said, she was jeopardizing its ability to recruit and retain valuable employees.","Last fall, senior partners at Kaplan Hecker & Fink, a New York law firm known for championing liberal causes, made a fateful decision: They were going to sideline their hard-charging and crusading founder, Roberta A.

Trump.

The prime-time bout, organized by CNN and simulcast on more than a dozen networks, was easily the most-viewed moment of the 2024 presidential campaign, the sort of mass civic gathering that is increasingly rare in a choose-your-own-news era of media. And the figure released on Friday by Nielsen, which mostly measures traditional TV sets, did not include the likely millions more who watched on digital news sites and social media platforms.

The size of the TV audience — similar to that for an N.F.L. conference championship game — could be grim news for the Biden campaign, given the shaky and stumbling performance by the president, which set off panic in the upper echelons of the Democratic Party.

But viewership was also down 30 percent from the first Biden-Trump debate in September 2020, which notched more than 73 million viewers. Nielsen said Thursday’s matchup in Atlanta was the lowest-rated general-election debate since the final meeting of George W. Bush and John Kerry in 2004.","The numbers are in: 51.3 million Americans tuned in live to watch Thursday night’s televised debate between President Biden and former President Donald J. Trump.

People worried about bills, feeling overwhelmed about overspending or concerned about money management may expect a “money talk” to lead to an argument, so they avoid bringing up the topic, according to a report from researchers at Cornell University and Yale University, published this month in The Journal of Consumer Psychology. Yet prior research has found that communicating about money helps couples spend more responsibly and better manage their debt.

“They anticipate conflict, so they’re choosing not to have these conversations at all,” said Emily Garbinsky, associate professor of marketing and management communication at Cornell’s business school and one of the study’s authors.

Why is it so difficult for some people to talk about money with their partners in the first place?

Aja Evans, a financial therapist in New York, said people may feel ashamed that they are having money troubles.

The company, Kobayashi Pharmaceutical, in March had reported five deaths potentially linked to its CholesteHelp rice and red-yeast pills. Japanese government health officials said the supplement, which claimed to help reduce cholesterol, contained puberulic acid, a highly toxic compound that is a product of mold.

In response to the sudden surge in reported deaths, Health Minister Keizo Takemi said it was “extremely regrettable” that Kobayashi Pharmaceutical had not updated the ministry sooner.

In response to the sudden surge in reported deaths, Health Minister Keizo Takemi said it was “extremely regrettable” that Kobayashi Pharmaceutical had not updated the ministry sooner.

Damages in antitrust cases like this are tripled by law, which means the league may have to pay more than $14 billion.

Rishi Shah, 38, the co-founder of Outcome Health, which provided ads on TVs in doctors’ offices, was convicted of more than a dozen fraud and money laundering charges by a federal jury last year. He and two other Outcome executives were sentenced last week in Chicago by US District Judge Thomas Durkin, the US Attorney’s Office said in a statement Monday.

Prosecutors had sought a 15-year sentence, describing Shah as the “driving force behind a dizzying array of lies to clients, lenders, investors and an audit firm.” He and the other executives were accused of lying to pharmaceutical company clients and taking money for ads that were never placed, and then misrepresenting the health of the company to investors.

Before the fraud was revealed in a 2017 Wall Street Journal article, Shah was a budding star in Democratic circles. Shah got the idea for Outcome — then known as Context Media Health — in 2006 while he was a student at Northwestern University just north of Chicago, and the company’s rapid rise over the next decade boosted his public profile. Then-Mayor Rahm Emanuel declared at a company press conference, “as Outcome goes, so goes Chicago.”

Oversold Ads

But Outcome’s claims of exponential revenue growth were driven by fraud, as the company sold more ads than it could broadcast and lied to clients like pharmaceutical giant Novo Nordisk A/S about the size of its network of TVs in doctors’ offices, according to prosecutors and securities regulators.

The company’s surge in cash from ad sales and financings allowed Shah to extract hundreds of millions of dollars from Outcome to live a lavish lifestyle, with weekend trips on private yachts and jets as well as a $10 million home, the government said. After raising more money from lenders and investors based on bogus financial statements in 2016, Shah’s net worth was reported at more than $4 billion, prosecutors said.

“Outcome’s former executives deceived their clients, their auditor, their lenders, and their investors for years,” Principal Deputy Assistant Attorney General Nicole M. Argentieri, head of the Justice Department’s Criminal Division, said in the statement. “Their sentences should serve as yet another reminder that ‘faking it until you make it’ is not an acceptable practice for any business.”

Story continues

Shah told the judge last week in a prepared statement that he was “ashamed and embarrassed” by his failure to properly manage the company’s aggressive push for growth, which led to “a number of fatal mistakes” that included not tracking the delivery of ads paid for by clients.

“The culture I created permissioned people on my team to think it was okay to create false data in response to client questions,” he said in the statement, which was filed with the court.

Shah was convicted in April 2023 along with Outcome President and co-founder Shradha Agarwal and Chief Financial Officer Brad Purdy. Prosecutors had sought 10-year sentences for Agarwal, 38, and Purdy, 35. But Durkin sentenced Agarwal to three years in a half-way house and Purdy got two years and three months in prison.

A group of funds, including those owned by Goldman, Alphabet and Pritzker, were among the investors that sued Outcome in 2017, claiming fraud tied to a $487.5 million fundraising that year that led to a $225 million dividend pocketed by Shah and Agarwal.

In addition, the US Securities and Exchange Commission sued Shah, Agarwal, Purdy and former chief growth officer Ashik Desai, claiming they used false financial statements to raise cash. Desai and two other Outcome employees pleaded guilty to charges before the criminal trial against the company’s top executives.

The criminal case is US v. Shah, 19-cr-00864, US District Court, Northern District of Illinois (Chicago).

His Secret To Success? 'Saving Like A Pessimist, Investing Like An Optimist'","Bill Gates Was The 'World's Richest Man' For A Record 18 Years. His Secret To Success? 'Saving Like A Pessimist, Investing Like An Optimist'

Bill Gates, co-founder of Microsoft and one of the most influential figures in the tech industry, is renowned for his business acumen and unique approach to financial management. After dropping out of college at 19, Gates cofounded Microsoft with Paul Allen, transforming it from a small startup into a global tech giant.

Don't Miss:

Gates dominated the Forbes list of the world’s wealthiest individuals from 1995 to 2017, holding the top spot for 18 out of 23 years. This unprecedented run showcases his ability to accumulate wealth and maintain and grow it over an extended period despite market fluctuations and economic challenges.

At the heart of Gates’ financial philosophy lies a seemingly contradictory lesson which author and psychologist Morgan Housel observed in a 2021 CNBC article: ""Save like a pessimist, invest like an optimist."" This maxim encapsulates his balanced approach to money management, a cornerstone of his success.

The Pessimist’s Safety Net

Gates’ pessimistic approach to saving is exemplified by a practice he implemented in Microsoft’s early days. He insisted on always having enough cash in the bank to keep the company running for 12 months, even if revenue dropped to zero. This conservative strategy ensured Microsoft’s survival during potential downturns and provided a solid foundation for growth.

In an interview with Charlie Rose, Gates reportedly expressed his concerns and the reasons for maintaining a consistent cash reserve. He stated, ""I was always worried because people who worked for me were older than me and had kids, and I always thought, ‘What if we don’t get paid? Will I be able to meet the payroll?’""

Trending: Want to invest in homes? $10 is enough on this platform that lets you cash out whenever you want.

The Optimist’s Growth Mindset

While maintaining a pessimistic approach to saving, Gates advocated for optimism in investments. He believed in the long-term potential of markets and technology, making bold bets that ultimately paid off. This optimistic outlook drove Microsoft’s innovation and expansion, contributing significantly to its dominant position in the tech industry.

Story continues

Housel noted Gates’ approach is rooted in a deep understanding of market dynamics. He believes that long-term progress is the general trend while short-term setbacks are inevitable. By preparing for immediate challenges (the pessimist’s view) while remaining confident in future growth (the optimist’s perspective), Gates created a stellar strategy for sustained success.

Anyone can apply this mindset to personal financial management:

Build an emergency fund (save like a pessimist): Aim to have 3-6 months of living expenses saved, preparing for unexpected challenges. Invest for the long term (invest like an optimist): Despite market fluctuations, maintain faith in the long-term growth potential of diversified investments. Balance risk and security: While taking calculated risks for growth, ensure a safety net to weather short-term storms. Continuous learning: Stay informed about financial markets and emerging opportunities, adapting your strategy as needed. Plan for the worst, hope for the best: Create contingency plans while working towards ambitious financial goals.

Bill Gates’ financial philosophy offers a valuable lesson in balancing caution and ambition. This balanced strategy, proven successful by one of the world’s most prominent business leaders, provides a road map for achieving lasting financial stability and growth.

His Secret To Success? 'Saving Like A Pessimist, Investing Like An Optimist'","Bill Gates Was The 'World's Richest Man' For A Record 18 Years. His Secret To Success? 'Saving Like A Pessimist, Investing Like An Optimist'

Bill Gates, co-founder of Microsoft and one of the most influential figures in the tech industry, is renowned for his business acumen and unique approach to financial management. After dropping out of college at 19, Gates cofounded Microsoft with Paul Allen, transforming it from a small startup into a global tech giant.

Don't Miss:

Gates dominated the Forbes list of the world’s wealthiest individuals from 1995 to 2017, holding the top spot for 18 out of 23 years. This unprecedented run showcases his ability to accumulate wealth and maintain and grow it over an extended period despite market fluctuations and economic challenges.

At the heart of Gates’ financial philosophy lies a seemingly contradictory lesson which author and psychologist Morgan Housel observed in a 2021 CNBC article: ""Save like a pessimist, invest like an optimist."" This maxim encapsulates his balanced approach to money management, a cornerstone of his success.

The Pessimist’s Safety Net

Gates’ pessimistic approach to saving is exemplified by a practice he implemented in Microsoft’s early days. He insisted on always having enough cash in the bank to keep the company running for 12 months, even if revenue dropped to zero. This conservative strategy ensured Microsoft’s survival during potential downturns and provided a solid foundation for growth.

In an interview with Charlie Rose, Gates reportedly expressed his concerns and the reasons for maintaining a consistent cash reserve. He stated, ""I was always worried because people who worked for me were older than me and had kids, and I always thought, ‘What if we don’t get paid? Will I be able to meet the payroll?’""

Trending: Want to invest in homes? $10 is enough on this platform that lets you cash out whenever you want.

The Optimist’s Growth Mindset

While maintaining a pessimistic approach to saving, Gates advocated for optimism in investments. He believed in the long-term potential of markets and technology, making bold bets that ultimately paid off. This optimistic outlook drove Microsoft’s innovation and expansion, contributing significantly to its dominant position in the tech industry.

Housel noted Gates’ approach is rooted in a deep understanding of market dynamics. He believes that long-term progress is the general trend while short-term setbacks are inevitable. By preparing for immediate challenges (the pessimist’s view) while remaining confident in future growth (the optimist’s perspective), Gates created a stellar strategy for sustained success.

Anyone can apply this mindset to personal financial management:

Build an emergency fund (save like a pessimist): Aim to have 3-6 months of living expenses saved, preparing for unexpected challenges. Invest for the long term (invest like an optimist): Despite market fluctuations, maintain faith in the long-term growth potential of diversified investments. Balance risk and security: While taking calculated risks for growth, ensure a safety net to weather short-term storms. Continuous learning: Stay informed about financial markets and emerging opportunities, adapting your strategy as needed. Plan for the worst, hope for the best: Create contingency plans while working towards ambitious financial goals.

Bill Gates’ financial philosophy offers a valuable lesson in balancing caution and ambition. This balanced strategy, proven successful by one of the world’s most prominent business leaders, provides a road map for achieving lasting financial stability and growth.

During the 2023 Daily Journal shareholder meeting, Munger responded to a question from CNBC's Becky Quick about the trend of large companies, including Meta, opting for self-insurance against various liabilities. Quickly inquired about the potential systemic issues this trend could cause and sought Munger's thoughts.

Don't Miss:

Are you rich? Here’s what Americans think you need to be considered wealthy.

Warren Buffett once said, ""If you don't find a way to make money while you sleep, you will work until you die."" Here's how you can collect passive rental income without being a landlord.

Known for his straightforward approach, Munger shared his personal philosophy on self-insurance. He said, ""In my own life, I'm a big self-insurer and so is Warren. It's ridiculous to carry fire insurance on my houses because I can so easily rebuild a house that would burn down. So why would I want to bother fooling around with the claims process and all kinds of things?""

He emphasized the practicality of self-insuring for those who can afford it, noting, ""If insurance, you should insure against things you can't afford to pay for yourself. But if you can afford to take the bumps, you know, some unusual expense coming along doesn't really hurt you that much. Why would you want to fool around with some insurance company? If your house burned down, I would just write a check and rebuild it.""

Munger argued that all intelligent people are self-insured. He then clarified, maybe not ""all,"" but said, ""All intelligent people should do it my way,"" highlighting the waste and fraud often associated with traditional insurance. ""There should be way more self-insurance in life. There's a lot of waste you're paying when you buy insurance for the other fellow's frauds, and there's a lot of fraud in life."" He explained that if you can afford to take the risk yourself, you should, but there is a risk involved.

It may be easy for a Munger to rebuild a home, considering his net worth was $2.6 billion during the interview. However, for the average person, this would be an extreme hardship. There is also the liability factor involved if something were to occur on your property, causing injury to another.

Trending: Elon Musk and Jeff Bezos are bullish on one city that could dethrone New York and become the new financial capital of the US. Investing in its booming real estate market has never been more accessible.

Story continues

Berkshire Hathaway, the conglomerate where Munger served as vice chairman, has substantial interests in the insurance industry. The company owns several major insurance subsidiaries, including GEICO, Berkshire Hathaway Reinsurance Group, and Berkshire Hathaway Primary Group. These insurance operations have been a core part of Berkshire Hathaway's financial success, making Munger's advice particularly notable given the company's deep involvement in the sector.

Despite his role at Berkshire Hathaway, a company deeply invested in the insurance industry, Munger maintained his candid stance. ""I'd rather tell it the way it is and tell it in a way that helps Berkshire. I'm not going to tell it differently than I think it really is just because it's better for Berkshire. Even though it's bad for Berkshire, I want to tell you, if you can afford to self-insure, self-insure.""

Munger's advice comes when a growing number of American homeowners opt to go without insurance, not because they can afford to self-insure like Munger, but due to rising costs. A recent study by the Insurance Information Institute found that 12% of Americans no longer have home insurance, up from 5% in 2019. This surge in uninsured homeowners is the highest the industry has seen, driven by the rising coverage costs.

Self-insurance may offer savings and simplicity, but it carries significant risks. For many, it might not be a viable option without a thorough understanding of their financial situation. Consulting a financial advisor can help assess whether self-insurance is feasible and advisable.

One such couple recently sought advice from financial expert Suze Orman on whether to buy a home or rent a luxury senior apartment.

The husband and wife are financially secure, with a combined monthly income of over $9,000 from pensions and Social Security, savings of around $100,000, and $850,000 in an IRA, annuity, and Roth account.

Don't Miss:

The average American couple has saved this much money for retirement — How do you compare ?

Warren Buffett once said, ""If you don't find a way to make money while you sleep, you will work until you die."" These high-yield real estate notes that pay 7.5% – 9% make earning passive income easier than ever.

Orman first highlighted the couple's solid financial standing, noting they have no debt and can sell their current home for $450,000 to $500,000 without incurring capital gains tax. This financial freedom means buying or renting isn't strictly about money but lifestyle preferences and practical considerations.

She pointed out the physical demands of home maintenance as a significant factor for retirees. ""They are in their seventies and are not sure if they are up to the challenge of daily housekeeping maintenance at their age,"" she said. KT KT echoed these concerns, highlighting that such tasks become increasingly burdensome as people age.

""After 70, you start to feel it,"" KT remarked, highlighting the importance of considering one's physical capabilities when deciding on living arrangements.

The couple is torn between the husband's preference for buying a home and the wife's inclination toward a luxury senior community apartment. The wife enjoys socializing and traveling, benefiting from the amenities and services such communities provide.

Suze Orman provided a compelling argument for the wife's choice, focusing on the benefits of senior community living. ""You have a community around you,"" she said, recounting the positive experiences of both her mother and KT's mother in similar settings. These communities offer various activities and social opportunities, such as happy hours, educational classes, movies, swimming, and golf.

Trending: Elon Musk and Jeff Bezos are bullish on one city that could dethrone New York and become the new financial capital of the US. Investing in its booming real estate market has never been more accessible.

Orman stressed the importance of moving to a senior community while both partners are healthy. ""In most cases, you can't move in if one of you is seriously ill,"" she advised, urging the couple to make the transition sooner rather than later. She also noted women’s higher life expectancy, which could leave the wife managing a house alone if her husband passes away first.

Story continues

Orman humorously warned, ""Your husband probably shouldn't hear this part of the answer,"" referring to the predominantly female demographics of senior communities and the social perks for the few men who live there.

Financial experts often advise evaluating the costs and benefits of both options for seniors with existing homes like this couple. Selling a house can free up equity that can be used to fund other retirement needs or investments while renting can simplify life by eliminating the need for ongoing maintenance and large, unexpected expenses.

While buying a home can offer stability, and potential equity growth, renting may provide a more carefree lifestyle, especially valuable in the later stages of life.

Financially, the couple can afford either option. Orman, however, leaned toward the wife's preference for a senior community, emphasizing its convenience and reduced responsibilities. She advised the husband to ""listen to your wife here because, in the long run, you're gonna be so happy that you did.""

If you’re exploring options for your retirement living arrangements, remember that the right choice depends on your individual needs and priorities. Consider factors like home maintenance, social engagement, and desired lifestyle when making this important decision. Consulting with a financial advisor can provide valuable guidance and ensure you make the best choice for your golden years.

Yahoo Finance,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/retired-couple-making-over-9000-190729460.html,2024-07-01,19:07:29 UTC,Retired Couple Making Over $9000 A Month With $1 Million Savings Can't Agree Whether To Buy Or Rent — Suze Orman Says 'Listen To Your Wife',"As retirement approaches, many couples face crucial decisions regarding their living arrangements. One such couple recently sought advice from financial expert Suze Orman on whether to buy a home or rent a luxury senior apartment.

The husband and wife are financially secure, with a combined monthly income of over $9,000 from pensions and Social Security, savings of around $100,000, and $850,000 in an IRA, annuity, and Roth account.

Don't Miss:

The average American couple has saved this much money for retirement — How do you compare ?

Warren Buffett once said, ""If you don't find a way to make money while you sleep, you will work until you die."" These high-yield real estate notes that pay 7.5% – 9% make earning passive income easier than ever.

Orman first highlighted the couple's solid financial standing, noting they have no debt and can sell their current home for $450,000 to $500,000 without incurring capital gains tax. This financial freedom means buying or renting isn't strictly about money but lifestyle preferences and practical considerations.

She pointed out the physical demands of home maintenance as a significant factor for retirees. ""They are in their seventies and are not sure if they are up to the challenge of daily housekeeping maintenance at their age,"" she said. KT KT echoed these concerns, highlighting that such tasks become increasingly burdensome as people age.

""After 70, you start to feel it,"" KT remarked, highlighting the importance of considering one's physical capabilities when deciding on living arrangements.

The couple is torn between the husband's preference for buying a home and the wife's inclination toward a luxury senior community apartment. The wife enjoys socializing and traveling, benefiting from the amenities and services such communities provide.

Suze Orman provided a compelling argument for the wife's choice, focusing on the benefits of senior community living. ""You have a community around you,"" she said, recounting the positive experiences of both her mother and KT's mother in similar settings. These communities offer various activities and social opportunities, such as happy hours, educational classes, movies, swimming, and golf.

Trending: Elon Musk and Jeff Bezos are bullish on one city that could dethrone New York and become the new financial capital of the US. Investing in its booming real estate market has never been more accessible.

Orman stressed the importance of moving to a senior community while both partners are healthy. ""In most cases, you can't move in if one of you is seriously ill,"" she advised, urging the couple to make the transition sooner rather than later. She also noted women’s higher life expectancy, which could leave the wife managing a house alone if her husband passes away first.

Orman humorously warned, ""Your husband probably shouldn't hear this part of the answer,"" referring to the predominantly female demographics of senior communities and the social perks for the few men who live there.

Financial experts often advise evaluating the costs and benefits of both options for seniors with existing homes like this couple. Selling a house can free up equity that can be used to fund other retirement needs or investments while renting can simplify life by eliminating the need for ongoing maintenance and large, unexpected expenses.

While buying a home can offer stability, and potential equity growth, renting may provide a more carefree lifestyle, especially valuable in the later stages of life.

Financially, the couple can afford either option. Orman, however, leaned toward the wife's preference for a senior community, emphasizing its convenience and reduced responsibilities. She advised the husband to ""listen to your wife here because, in the long run, you're gonna be so happy that you did.""

If you’re exploring options for your retirement living arrangements, remember that the right choice depends on your individual needs and priorities. Consider factors like home maintenance, social engagement, and desired lifestyle when making this important decision. Consulting with a financial advisor can provide valuable guidance and ensure you make the best choice for your golden years.

Most Read from Bloomberg

The move came as Microsoft shares rose to a fresh record, bringing their total gain this year to 21%. The company, through its partnership with OpenAI, has been one of the biggest beneficiaries of the artificial intelligence rally that has powered the US stock market higher.

More than 90% of Ballmer’s $157.2 billion net worth is in Microsoft shares, according to the Bloomberg Billionaires Index. Gates, meanwhile, has diversified his $156.7 billion fortune: About half his wealth is held through Cascade Investment, which was created with the proceeds of Microsoft stock sales and dividends. He also owns a $21 billion stake in waste-management company Republic Services Inc. through Cascade.

Gates, 68, has been slowly reducing his fortune through philanthropy. Along with his ex-wife Melinda French Gates and his friend Warren Buffett, Gates has funneled billions of dollars of his personal money to build up the $75 billion Gates Foundation, one of the biggest charitable organizations in the world.

Since they started the foundation more than two decades ago, Gates and his former wife have given almost $60 billion from their personal fortunes. French Gates recently stepped down as co-chair of the foundation and received $12.5 billion to use for her own charitable purposes.

In 2010, Gates, French Gates and Buffett also founded the Giving Pledge, an organization that encourages the world’s richest people to give away the majority of their fortunes in their lifetimes or their wills. Ballmer, 68, who has not signed the Giving Pledge, has his own philanthropic work but nowhere on the scale of Gates.

Gates founded Microsoft with his friend Paul Allen in 1975 and led it until 2000, when Ballmer — one of the company’s earliest employees — replaced him as CEO. Ballmer retired in 2014 and became Microsoft’s largest shareholder that same year. He bought the NBA’s Los Angeles Clippers for $2 billion in 2014, an investment that is estimated to be worth $4.6 billion today.

Yahoo Finance,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/heres-why-may-want-plan-075900969.html,2024-07-02,07:59:00 UTC,Here's Why You May Want to Plan to Claim Social Security at 62 -- Despite the Smaller Monthly Check,"It's a good idea to try to figure out when you'll claim Social Security well ahead of retirement. That way, you can get an estimate of your monthly benefit based on your filing age. And from there, you can do some number crunching to make sure you're making a smart decision.

Now there's a pretty wide range of Social Security filing ages you can choose from, the earliest of which is 62. There's technically no latest or final filing age, though you should know that there's nothing to be gained financially by delaying Social Security past the age of 70.

Image source: Getty Images.

But often, you'll hear that it's smart to wait until at least your full retirement age (FRA) to claim Social Security. That age is 66, 67, or somewhere in between, depending on when you were born.

Full retirement age is when you get your complete monthly Social Security benefit based on your individual wage history. Taking benefits at 62 could slash them by up to 30%, which is a financial hit you may not want.

But while claiming Social Security at 62 may not be your optimal choice, you may want to plan on doing so anyway. Here's why.

It's a good backup plan

It's not a given that you'll need to claim Social Security as soon as you retire. If you have a lot of savings, you may be able to take withdrawals from your 401(k) or IRA and hold off on Social Security to score a higher benefit.

But often, people retire and sign up for Social Security right away. That's something you may not be planning to do until full retirement age arrives. But sometimes plans can go awry.

It's not uncommon to be forced into an earlier retirement than what's desired for a variety of reasons. These could run the gamut from health issues to being ousted from a job due to age (something that's absolutely illegal but also hard to prove in many cases).

If you end up out of work at age 62, you may have no choice but to claim Social Security right away to keep up with your expenses. And that's why it may be a good idea to just plan on filing for benefits at 62 in the course of running your retirement numbers. That way, you're accounting for the lowest monthly benefit you might get. If you're able to file at any point beyond age 62, you stand to collect more money, which only improves your numbers.

It pays to play it safe

To be clear, planning for a smaller Social Security benefit and actually collecting one are two different things. If, come age 62, you're still working and in good health, then it could absolutely pay to delay your filing until full retirement age or beyond (there's an 8% boost coming your way for each year you hold off on filing past that point, up until your 70th birthday).

Story continues

Rather, the takeaway here is that you should simply plan on filing for Social Security at 62 in case you end up being forced to do so. If you're able to make your retirement expenses work on a smaller monthly benefit, you'll be that much happier if your actual benefit ends up being far more substantial.

The $ 22,924 Social Security bonus most retirees completely overlook

If you're like most Americans, you're a few years (or more) behind on your retirement savings. But a handful of little-known ""Social Security secrets"" could help ensure a boost in your retirement income. For example: one easy trick could pay you as much as $22,924 more... each year!

Yahoo Finance,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/heres-why-may-want-plan-075900969.html,2024-07-02,07:59:00 UTC,Here's Why You May Want to Plan to Claim Social Security at 62 -- Despite the Smaller Monthly Check,"It's a good idea to try to figure out when you'll claim Social Security well ahead of retirement. That way, you can get an estimate of your monthly benefit based on your filing age. And from there, you can do some number crunching to make sure you're making a smart decision.

Now there's a pretty wide range of Social Security filing ages you can choose from, the earliest of which is 62. There's technically no latest or final filing age, though you should know that there's nothing to be gained financially by delaying Social Security past the age of 70.

But often, you'll hear that it's smart to wait until at least your full retirement age (FRA) to claim Social Security. That age is 66, 67, or somewhere in between, depending on when you were born.

Full retirement age is when you get your complete monthly Social Security benefit based on your individual wage history. Taking benefits at 62 could slash them by up to 30%, which is a financial hit you may not want.

But while claiming Social Security at 62 may not be your optimal choice, you may want to plan on doing so anyway. Here's why.

It's a good backup plan

It's not a given that you'll need to claim Social Security as soon as you retire. If you have a lot of savings, you may be able to take withdrawals from your 401(k) or IRA and hold off on Social Security to score a higher benefit.

But often, people retire and sign up for Social Security right away. That's something you may not be planning to do until full retirement age arrives. But sometimes plans can go awry.

It's not uncommon to be forced into an earlier retirement than what's desired for a variety of reasons. These could run the gamut from health issues to being ousted from a job due to age (something that's absolutely illegal but also hard to prove in many cases).

If you end up out of work at age 62, you may have no choice but to claim Social Security right away to keep up with your expenses. And that's why it may be a good idea to just plan on filing for benefits at 62 in the course of running your retirement numbers. That way, you're accounting for the lowest monthly benefit you might get. If you're able to file at any point beyond age 62, you stand to collect more money, which only improves your numbers.

It pays to play it safe

To be clear, planning for a smaller Social Security benefit and actually collecting one are two different things. If, come age 62, you're still working and in good health, then it could absolutely pay to delay your filing until full retirement age or beyond (there's an 8% boost coming your way for each year you hold off on filing past that point, up until your 70th birthday).

Story continues

Rather, the takeaway here is that you should simply plan on filing for Social Security at 62 in case you end up being forced to do so. If you're able to make your retirement expenses work on a smaller monthly benefit, you'll be that much happier if your actual benefit ends up being far more substantial.

Yahoo Finance,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/3-stocks-could-create-lasting-175000610.html,2024-07-02,17:50:00 UTC,3 Stocks That Could Create Lasting Generational Wealth,"If you're trying to build generational wealth, you shouldn't think about getting rich quick. It's all about creating a portfolio of companies that are built to last. On that score, you should keep old favorite Coca-Cola (NYSE: KO) and relatively young Chipotle Mexican Grill (NYSE: CMG) on your wish list, while Hormel Foods (NYSE: HRL) might be worth adding to your portfolio right now. Here's a quick look at each stock.

1. Coca-Cola is a behemoth

With a market cap of roughly $270 billion, Coca-Cola is one of the largest consumer staples companies on the planet. Don't underestimate the benefit this has for the company and for investors. For starters, Coca-Cola's business is underpinned by a stable of iconic brands, notably including namesake Coke. Moreover, the company has a global distribution network and the financial firepower to support its brands with advertising. And it's big enough to buy its way into new products and categories over time.

The consumer staples sector is one in which retailers and end consumers are both seen as customers for companies like Coca-Cola. The advantages Coca-Cola generates from its size work to entice consumers into stores and, thus, get stores to buy Coca-Cola products for sale. Small competitors that can't match up often don't get the same shelf space, effectively cementing Coca-Cola's already dominant position. But if the smaller competitors are on to something new, well, they and their hot new product might just end up a part of Coca-Cola. These are the many reasons Coca-Cola is a Dividend King, with over 60 years of annual dividend increases behind it. The dividend yield is roughly 3% today, well above the 1.3% on offer from the S&P 500 Index.

2. Chipotle Mexican Grill is established, but still growing

Compared to a company like McDonald's, Chipotle Mexican Grill is still just a kid. But it has clearly established itself as a dominant force in the restaurant sector. In fact, the company's fresh made assembly line format has been copied many times over, including by recent market darling Cava. Chipotle has done so well for so long that its stock rose to herculean heights, leading it to a huge 50:1 stock split to get the price back down to the level where mere mortals could afford to buy a share. The best news? Despite the already impressive growth in Chipotle's business, it is still showing impressive signs of strength.

For example, in the first quarter of 2024 the company's overall sales rose a huge 14% year over year to $2.7 billion. For reference, the first-quarter top line at McDonald's was nearly $6.2 billion, so there's still plenty of room for growth ahead at Chipotle. But the really interesting number was Chipotle's same-store sales, which came in at 7%. Half of that figure would be considered good, noting that McDonald's managed only 1.9% in the quarter. What this tells you is that Chipotle is still benefiting from strong demand, which should allow it to keep opening new restaurants for the foreseeable future. Chipotle is focused on investing for growth, so it doesn't pay a dividend. But if you don't mind that fact, it looks like the kind of stock that you could hand on to the next generation for safe keeping. That said, the stock is always expensive, so waiting for a market downturn might lead to a better entry point.

3. Hormel's dividend yield is historically high

Like Coca-Cola, Hormel Foods is a Dividend King. It has increased its dividend annually for 58 consecutive years. It isn't nearly as large as Coca-Cola, but it does have a stable of industry leading brands, like Spam and Planters, among many others. It is also highly innovative, bringing out ""new"" and ""improved"" products with great regularity. The words ""new"" and ""improved"" have particular power with consumers, which is one of the reasons retailers like to work with Hormel. So why is the stock's yield near its highest levels of all time at 3.7%?

The quick answer is a perfect storm. Hormel wasn't able to pass price increases on to consumers as well as its peers, margins got squeezed by inflation, avian flu has been pretty bad lately, sales in China have been slow to recover from COVID lockdowns, and the company bought the Planters brand right as the nut category of the snack sector was slowing down. Any one of these problems alone wouldn't be too big a deal. All five at the same time has investors worried that Hormel's best days are in the past. Given the company's long and successful history, though, it seems reasonable to give the management the benefit of the doubt. And you'll be paid well to wait for Hormel to muddle through to better days.

One to buy, one to consider, and one to watch

Given the negative sentiment around Hormel today, it looks like an attractive long-term buying opportunity. Coca-Cola isn't exactly cheap, but it isn't exactly expensive, either. If you want to create a reliable income stream, you might want to take a closer look. Chipotle has the best growth prospects of the three, but investors are pricing in a lot of good news. If there's a bear market and investors throw the baby out with the bathwater, as is normally the case, you might want to jump aboard.

Yahoo Finance,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/cathie-wood-says-software-next-125500608.html,2024-07-02,12:55:00 UTC,Cathie Wood Says Software Is the Next Big AI Opportunity -- 2 Supercharged Stocks You'll Regret Not Buying if She's Right,"Last year, Ark Investment Management CEO Cathie Wood said software companies will be the next big opportunity in artificial intelligence (AI), predicting they will eventually generate $8 in revenue for every $1 spent on chips from leading suppliers like Nvidia.

Ark operates several funds (both private and exchange-traded) that reflect that stance. Using the Ark Venture Fund, Wood has piled into private AI software companies like OpenAI, Anthropic, and Elon Musk's xAI. Plus, Tesla is the largest holding in the flagship Ark Innovation ETF, which Wood says is the largest AI opportunity in the world thanks to its autonomous self-driving software.

If Wood is right about AI software, there could be a long list of winners in the coming years. Here's why CrowdStrike (NASDAQ: CRWD) and Meta Platforms (NASDAQ: META) might be two of the biggest.

1. CrowdStrike: A leader in AI-powered cybersecurity

CrowdStrike is one of the world's best cybersecurity companies. In fact, its stock only needs to rise another 14% to eclipse the $104 billion valuation of the current industry leader, Palo Alto Networks. CrowdStrike's success stems from its unique lightweight security architecture and its reliance on AI to autonomously thwart attacks.

CrowdStrike's AI models make over 180 million indicator-of-attack decisions every second -- in other words, they are constantly analyzing the motive and intent of attackers to determine the type of threat they pose. Those models are trained on more than 2 trillion security events each day, and that number climbs as more customers join CrowdStrike, which extends the company's AI advantage over its competitors.

All of that happens in the cloud. By using CrowdStrike, companies don't have to install bulky programs on every single device in their organization. Instead, they install a lightweight sensor that is connected to the cloud, which occupies minimal processing power compared to traditional cybersecurity software.

CrowdStrike has taken a platform approach to cybersecurity since the day it was founded, which is in contrast to industry norms where different providers specialize in specific segments like cloud security, identity protection, and endpoint security. CrowdStrike covers all bases through its 28 modules, and while not every business needs the entire suite, 65% of customers were using five or more modules as of the recent fiscal 2025 first quarter (ended April 30).

According to a CrowdStrike-sponsored study by International Data Corporation, businesses can save $6 for every $1 they invest in consolidating their cybersecurity needs onto the one platform. Therefore, not only do they get best-in-class protection, but switching to CrowdStrike is a no-brainer financially.

Story continues

CrowdStrike ended Q1 with a record $3.6 billion in annual recurring revenue, but management believes that figure will surge 177% to $10 billion within the next five to seven years. That estimate might even be conservative considering how quickly AI is advancing, which will not only improve CrowdStrike's protective capabilities, but will create new threats that will drive more cybersecurity spending in the corporate sector.

2. Meta Platforms: A social media giant turned AI developer

Meta Platforms is home to leading social networks like Facebook, Instagram, and WhatsApp, which serve 3.2 billion people every day. The company is already using AI to curate the content feeds for each user on Facebook and Instagram to ensure they are seeing posts that are most relevant to them. Last year, this drove an increase in engagement across both platforms, which provided Meta with more opportunities to generate advertising revenue.

But the company might have an even greater AI opportunity in its large language model (LLM) called Llama. It's the world's largest open-source model, so developers can use it for free to build their own AI applications, which allows Meta to crowdsource its testing to make improvements more quickly. That's important because Llama is the key to creating new AI features for Meta's existing platforms.

For example, the company launched a chatbot called Meta AI last year that users can access through Facebook, Instagram, Messenger, and WhatsApp. It can answer complex questions and generate images like most chatbots, but it can also be added to group chats to make restaurant and travel recommendations, or even offer gift ideas. Meta AI is currently powered by Llama 3, but the company is already training its next-generation model, which should offer even better capabilities.

Eventually, every business using Meta's apps could have its own personalized Meta AI-style chatbot that can handle incoming customer queries, and potentially even process sales. That should create new opportunities for Meta to generate revenue.

Here's the best part about Meta stock: It's cheap. Based on the company's $17.41 in trailing-12-month earnings per share, it trades at a price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio of 28.9. That's a 9.4% discount to the 31.9 P/E ratio of the Nasdaq-100 index.

In 2025, Wall Street thinks Meta will generate $21.59 in earnings, which places its forward P/E ratio at just 23.3. That implies Meta stock will have to rise 36.9% by the end of next year just to trade in line with the broader tech sector.

If Cathie Wood is right about AI software, Meta stock might be an even bigger bargain today than the above numbers suggest, because there could be entirely new AI monetization opportunities to come as this story unfolds.

Ark operates several funds (both private and exchange-traded) that reflect that stance. Using the Ark Venture Fund, Wood has piled into private AI software companies like OpenAI, Anthropic, and Elon Musk's xAI. Plus, Tesla is the largest holding in the flagship Ark Innovation ETF, which Wood says is the largest AI opportunity in the world thanks to its autonomous self-driving software.

If Wood is right about AI software, there could be a long list of winners in the coming years. Here's why CrowdStrike (NASDAQ: CRWD) and Meta Platforms (NASDAQ: META) might be two of the biggest.

1. CrowdStrike: A leader in AI-powered cybersecurity

CrowdStrike is one of the world's best cybersecurity companies. In fact, its stock only needs to rise another 14% to eclipse the $104 billion valuation of the current industry leader, Palo Alto Networks. CrowdStrike's success stems from its unique lightweight security architecture and its reliance on AI to autonomously thwart attacks.

Yahoo Finance,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/1-stock-split-stock-confidently-090600417.html,2024-07-01,09:06:00 UTC,"1 Stock-Split Stock You Can Confidently Buy for the Second Half of 2024, and 2 to Avoid","With the exception of artificial intelligence (AI), there's not a hotter trend on Wall Street right now than companies conducting stock splits.

A stock split is an event where a publicly traded company cosmetically alters its share price and outstanding share count by the same magnitude. It's ""cosmetic"" in the sense that changing a company's share price and share count by the same factor has no effect on its market cap or operating performance.

Image source: Getty Images.

There are two types of stock splits: forward and reverse. With a forward-stock split, companies are angling to make their shares more nominally affordable for retail investors who might not have access to fractional-share purchases with their broker. Meanwhile, a reverse-stock split aims to increase a company's share price, often with the goal of ensuring it meets the minimum continued listing standards on a major stock exchange.

Most investors tend to favor forward-stock splits, because the companies enacting forward splits are typically out-innovating and out-executing their peers.

Since 2024 began, nine high-profile stocks have announced or completed a stock split. However, not all of these stock-split stocks share the same outlook. As we motor into the second half of 2024, one of these stock-split stocks stands out as a phenomenal deal for patient investors, while two others are worth avoiding.

Stock-split stock No. 1 that's worth avoiding in the second half of 2024: Nvidia

In spite of its undeniable popularity, AI juggernaut Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA) is the first stock-split I'd suggest investors purposefully avoid for the final six months of 2024. Nvidia announced a 10-for-1 forward split on May 22, which was completed on June 7.

Although I'm no fan of Nvidia from an investment perspective, I'm happy to give the company credit where it's due. Nvidia's AI-graphics processing units (GPUs) have set the standard in high-compute data centers. According to semiconductor analysis firm TechInsights, it was responsible for 98% of the 3.85 million AI-GPUs that were shipped last year. Having first-mover and compute advantages over its peers has given the company substantial pricing power.

But this is where the praise ends and history works its way back into the discussion.

Since the advent of the internet in the mid-1990s, there hasn't been a buzzy innovation, technology, or trend that avoided an early stage euphoria-bursting event. This is to say that investors have overestimated the adoption and/or utility of every next-big-thing innovation or technology for 30 years (including the internet itself). While this doesn't mean artificial intelligence and Nvidia can't be wildly successful over the long run, the simple fact that most businesses lack a concrete plan for AI suggests a bubble is brewing.

Story continues

To add to this point, Nvidia's trailing-12-month price-to-sales (P/S) ratio is strikingly similar to the P/S ratio peaks we witnessed from Cisco Systems and Amazon prior to the dot-com bubble bursting. History may not precisely repeat on Wall Street, but it does have a tendency to rhyme.

We're also starting to see evidence that competition will weigh on Nvidia's monopoly like market share in AI-accelerated data centers. Even if the company's GPUs were to maintain their compute advantages, new competitors can benefit from demand overwhelming supply — and Nvidia can't meet all of its enterprise demand.

Furthermore, Nvidia's four-largest customers by net sales are internally developing their own AI-GPUs. Even if these chips are used as a complement to Nvidia's H100 GPU, it signals the intent by America's most-influential businesses to reduce their reliance on Nvidia's hardware.

Stock-split stock No. 2 to keep your distance from in the latter half of 2024: Chipotle Mexican Grill

The second stock-split stock that investors would be wise to avoid in the second half of 2024 is none other than the hottest fast-casual restaurant chain on Wall Street, Chipotle Mexican Grill (NYSE: CMG). Chipotle's board announced the company's first-ever stock split (a 50-for-1 forward split) on March 19, with its share adjustment occurring after the closing bell on June 25.

Similar to Nvidia, I can recognize that Chipotle and its management team have done a lot right, even if I'm not currently a fan from an investment standpoint. Chipotle shares have rallied more than 14,800% since its initial public offering price of $22 in January 2006 due to a combination of simplicity and innovation.

Chipotle has kept things simple by sourcing its vegetables locally (when possible), using responsibly raised meats, prepping its food daily, and avoiding a bulky menu. The result is a well-oiled machine that quickly prepares meals and keeps lines in its stores moving.

But there's only so much innovation that can be squeezed out of a fast-casual restaurant chain. While the introduction of mobile order-dedicated drive-thru lanes (""Chipotlanes"") has helped the company immensely, Chipotle's same-store sales grew by only 7% during the first quarter. Though 7% same-store sales growth would be phenomenal for most businesses, it's a genuine eyesore for a company valued at roughly 50 times forward-year earnings.

I'll also add that 1.6% of the 7% organic growth rate in existing stores came from an ""increase in average check."" While it's always good news when a company enjoys strong pricing power, nearly a quarter of Chipotle's organic sales growth is simply due to inflation.

Considering that there are still predictive indicators that suggest a U.S. economic downturn is on the horizon — e.g., the historic decline in U.S. M2 money supply — companies with premium valuations in traditionally slower-growing industries, like Chipotle, are the likeliest to get thumped if a recession does materialize.

The stock-split stock you can confidently buy for the second half of 2024: Sirius XM Holdings

Out of the nine high-profile companies to have announced a stock split in 2024, eight are conducting forward splits. However, the best value of the group is the only top-tier company slated to complete a reverse-stock split: satellite-radio provider Sirius XM Holdings (NASDAQ: SIRI).

In a June 17 filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission, Sirius XM announced its intent to conduct a 1-for-10 reverse split upon completing its merger with Liberty Media's Sirius XM tracking stock, Liberty Sirius XM Group. This combination and share consolidation, which'll create a single outstanding share base, is expected to close during the third quarter.

Although reverse-stock splits are usually undertaken by companies on the decline, Sirius XM's operating performance has pointed to steady growth over the long haul.

One of the keys to Sirius XM's success is its revenue diversity. Terrestrial and online radio providers generate most of their sales from advertising. The thing about advertising is that it's highly cyclical and prone to fluctuations. Sirius XM brought in less than 19% of its first-quarter sales from ads (via Pandora).

By comparison, Sirius XM generated close to 78% of its sales in the March-ended quarter from subscriptions. Subscribers to its satellite-radio services are far less likely to cancel than businesses are to reduce their ad spending during periods of economic turbulence. Couple this with the fact that Sirius XM is the only licensed satellite-radio operator — ergo, it has exceptionally strong pricing power — and you have a recipe for steady operating cash flow in virtually any economic climate.

Additionally, Sirius XM enjoys better cost transparency than most radio operators. Whereas content and royalty costs are going to ebb-and-flow from quarter to quarter, transmission and equipment expenses aren't going to change much, if at all, regardless of how many subscribers the company adds.

At no point in Sirius XM's 30 years as a publicly traded company has it been cheaper than it is now. Shares can be scooped up by opportunistic investors for just 8 times forward-year earnings, which represents a 55% discount to its average forward-year earnings multiple over the last five years.

Yahoo Finance,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/1-stock-split-stock-confidently-090600417.html,2024-07-01,09:06:00 UTC,"1 Stock-Split Stock You Can Confidently Buy for the Second Half of 2024, and 2 to Avoid","With the exception of artificial intelligence (AI), there's not a hotter trend on Wall Street right now than companies conducting stock splits.

A stock split is an event where a publicly traded company cosmetically alters its share price and outstanding share count by the same magnitude. It's ""cosmetic"" in the sense that changing a company's share price and share count by the same factor has no effect on its market cap or operating performance.

Image source: Getty Images.

There are two types of stock splits: forward and reverse. With a forward-stock split, companies are angling to make their shares more nominally affordable for retail investors who might not have access to fractional-share purchases with their broker. Meanwhile, a reverse-stock split aims to increase a company's share price, often with the goal of ensuring it meets the minimum continued listing standards on a major stock exchange.

Most investors tend to favor forward-stock splits, because the companies enacting forward splits are typically out-innovating and out-executing their peers.

Since 2024 began, nine high-profile stocks have announced or completed a stock split. However, not all of these stock-split stocks share the same outlook. As we motor into the second half of 2024, one of these stock-split stocks stands out as a phenomenal deal for patient investors, while two others are worth avoiding.

Stock-split stock No. 1 that's worth avoiding in the second half of 2024: Nvidia

In spite of its undeniable popularity, AI juggernaut Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA) is the first stock-split I'd suggest investors purposefully avoid for the final six months of 2024. Nvidia announced a 10-for-1 forward split on May 22, which was completed on June 7.

Although I'm no fan of Nvidia from an investment perspective, I'm happy to give the company credit where it's due. Nvidia's AI-graphics processing units (GPUs) have set the standard in high-compute data centers. According to semiconductor analysis firm TechInsights, it was responsible for 98% of the 3.85 million AI-GPUs that were shipped last year. Having first-mover and compute advantages over its peers has given the company substantial pricing power.

But this is where the praise ends and history works its way back into the discussion.

Since the advent of the internet in the mid-1990s, there hasn't been a buzzy innovation, technology, or trend that avoided an early stage euphoria-bursting event. This is to say that investors have overestimated the adoption and/or utility of every next-big-thing innovation or technology for 30 years (including the internet itself). While this doesn't mean artificial intelligence and Nvidia can't be wildly successful over the long run, the simple fact that most businesses lack a concrete plan for AI suggests a bubble is brewing.

Story continues

To add to this point, Nvidia's trailing-12-month price-to-sales (P/S) ratio is strikingly similar to the P/S ratio peaks we witnessed from Cisco Systems and Amazon prior to the dot-com bubble bursting. History may not precisely repeat on Wall Street, but it does have a tendency to rhyme.

We're also starting to see evidence that competition will weigh on Nvidia's monopoly like market share in AI-accelerated data centers. Even if the company's GPUs were to maintain their compute advantages, new competitors can benefit from demand overwhelming supply — and Nvidia can't meet all of its enterprise demand.

Furthermore, Nvidia's four-largest customers by net sales are internally developing their own AI-GPUs. Even if these chips are used as a complement to Nvidia's H100 GPU, it signals the intent by America's most-influential businesses to reduce their reliance on Nvidia's hardware.

Stock-split stock No. 2 to keep your distance from in the latter half of 2024: Chipotle Mexican Grill

The second stock-split stock that investors would be wise to avoid in the second half of 2024 is none other than the hottest fast-casual restaurant chain on Wall Street, Chipotle Mexican Grill (NYSE: CMG). Chipotle's board announced the company's first-ever stock split (a 50-for-1 forward split) on March 19, with its share adjustment occurring after the closing bell on June 25.

Similar to Nvidia, I can recognize that Chipotle and its management team have done a lot right, even if I'm not currently a fan from an investment standpoint. Chipotle shares have rallied more than 14,800% since its initial public offering price of $22 in January 2006 due to a combination of simplicity and innovation.

Chipotle has kept things simple by sourcing its vegetables locally (when possible), using responsibly raised meats, prepping its food daily, and avoiding a bulky menu. The result is a well-oiled machine that quickly prepares meals and keeps lines in its stores moving.

But there's only so much innovation that can be squeezed out of a fast-casual restaurant chain. While the introduction of mobile order-dedicated drive-thru lanes (""Chipotlanes"") has helped the company immensely, Chipotle's same-store sales grew by only 7% during the first quarter. Though 7% same-store sales growth would be phenomenal for most businesses, it's a genuine eyesore for a company valued at roughly 50 times forward-year earnings.

I'll also add that 1.6% of the 7% organic growth rate in existing stores came from an ""increase in average check."" While it's always good news when a company enjoys strong pricing power, nearly a quarter of Chipotle's organic sales growth is simply due to inflation.

Considering that there are still predictive indicators that suggest a U.S. economic downturn is on the horizon — e.g., the historic decline in U.S. M2 money supply — companies with premium valuations in traditionally slower-growing industries, like Chipotle, are the likeliest to get thumped if a recession does materialize.

The stock-split stock you can confidently buy for the second half of 2024: Sirius XM Holdings

Out of the nine high-profile companies to have announced a stock split in 2024, eight are conducting forward splits. However, the best value of the group is the only top-tier company slated to complete a reverse-stock split: satellite-radio provider Sirius XM Holdings (NASDAQ: SIRI).

In a June 17 filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission, Sirius XM announced its intent to conduct a 1-for-10 reverse split upon completing its merger with Liberty Media's Sirius XM tracking stock, Liberty Sirius XM Group. This combination and share consolidation, which'll create a single outstanding share base, is expected to close during the third quarter.

Although reverse-stock splits are usually undertaken by companies on the decline, Sirius XM's operating performance has pointed to steady growth over the long haul.

One of the keys to Sirius XM's success is its revenue diversity. Terrestrial and online radio providers generate most of their sales from advertising. The thing about advertising is that it's highly cyclical and prone to fluctuations. Sirius XM brought in less than 19% of its first-quarter sales from ads (via Pandora).

By comparison, Sirius XM generated close to 78% of its sales in the March-ended quarter from subscriptions. Subscribers to its satellite-radio services are far less likely to cancel than businesses are to reduce their ad spending during periods of economic turbulence. Couple this with the fact that Sirius XM is the only licensed satellite-radio operator — ergo, it has exceptionally strong pricing power — and you have a recipe for steady operating cash flow in virtually any economic climate.

Additionally, Sirius XM enjoys better cost transparency than most radio operators. Whereas content and royalty costs are going to ebb-and-flow from quarter to quarter, transmission and equipment expenses aren't going to change much, if at all, regardless of how many subscribers the company adds.

At no point in Sirius XM's 30 years as a publicly traded company has it been cheaper than it is now. Shares can be scooped up by opportunistic investors for just 8 times forward-year earnings, which represents a 55% discount to its average forward-year earnings multiple over the last five years.

A whopping 88% of current retirees depend on their benefits, according to a 2024 poll from Gallup, with 60% of that group saying Social Security is a major income source.

Some retirees even rely on their benefits as their only source of income. Even if you have a robust nest egg, if you end up living a long lifespan, there's a chance your savings will run out eventually.

The more you can do to maximize your benefits now, the better shape you'll be in down the road. No matter what your financial situation looks like, there's one simple strategy that could help the average retiree increase their benefits by more than $700 per month.

Image source: Getty Images.

The age at which you file could make or break your retirement

Determining what age to begin taking Social Security is one of the most important retirement decisions you'll ever make.

Your claiming age will directly affect how much you receive each month, and in general, your benefit amount is locked in once you file -- save for annual cost-of-living adjustments. In other words, this choice will have a lifelong impact on your finances.

You can begin taking retirement benefits as early as age 62. By waiting until your full retirement age -- which is age 67 for everyone born in 1960 or later -- you'll receive 100% of your benefit based on your work history. If you hold off even longer until age 70, you'll collect your full benefit plus a bonus amount each month.

Image source: The Motley Fool.

These adjustments are generally permanent, and they can be significant, too. Claim at age 62, and your benefits will be reduced by up to 30% per month. Wait until age 70, and you'll collect a bonus of at least 24% per month on top of your full payments.

For the average worker, that adds up to hundreds of dollars per month. According to 2023 data from the Social Security Administration, the average retired worker collects around $1,298 per month in benefits at age 62. At age 70, though, the average benefit is around $2,038 per month -- a difference of $740 per month.

Delaying benefits isn't always the best move

Waiting until age 70 can be a fantastic move if your savings are falling short or you simply want to maximize your retirement income. However, it won't be the right strategy for everyone, and there are good reasons to consider claiming early, too.

For one, claiming earlier can be smart if you have reason to believe you may not live well into your 70s or beyond. While it's not the most pleasant topic to think about, if you're battling health issues, claiming early could give you more time to enjoy your benefits than if you were to delay.

Story continues

Filing early can also be a strategic decision if your spouse is also entitled to retirement benefits. One of you may choose to claim early to provide some extra income early in retirement, while the other delays to earn larger checks. This approach can help you retire sooner without having to sacrifice as much income.

Deciding when to take Social Security is a highly personal decision that depends on several factors, but if your primary goal is to maximize your income, delaying benefits is one of the best moves you can make. Waiting a few years to file boosts the average retiree's income by hundreds of dollars per month, which can set you up for a far more comfortable retirement.

The elite among them eventually may earn entry into the category of Dividend Kings -- companies that have raised their payouts annually for at least 50 consecutive years.

In addition to being a Dividend King, PepsiCo (NASDAQ: PEP) has a yield of 3.3% at its current share price -- high relative to the average yield of 1.3% for the S&P 500.

Getting to know ITW

Illinois Tool Works, which also goes by ITW, is a global industrial conglomerate with a diversified product portfolio spanning several industries. The company mainly sells products to businesses, so it would be understandable if you were unfamiliar with many of its brands.

It doesn't make massive earth-moving equipment or highly complex machinery. Rather, many of its products act as role players in larger systems. Here's a breakdown of its segments and some product examples.

Segment Product Examples 2023 Revenue 2023 Operating Margin Automotive Fasteners, interior and exterior components, powertrain components $3.2 billion 17% Test & Measurement and Electronics Laboratory testing and assembly equipment, accessories, consumables, aftermarket parts and services $2.8 billion 24% Food Equipment Advanced warewash, services, equipment for cooking, refrigeration, and food processing $2.6 billion 27% Construction Products Fasting solutions, complementary fasteners and accessories, construction design and engineering software $2 billion 28% Welding Welding equipment, specialty consumables, safety solutions $1.9 billion 32% Polymers & Fluids Engineered adhesives, sealants, coatings, lubricants, additives, automotive wiper blades, cleaners $1.8 billion 27% Specialty Products Zippers and six-pack rings for packaged goods, medical device products, aircraft ground support equipment, coating and metalizing businesses for product branding and national security markets $1.7 billion 27%

Data source: Illinois Tool Works.

One thing that separates ITW from other industrial conglomerates is that none of its seven segments dominate its revenue mix. And aside from automotive -- which has been struggling in North America but growing rapidly in China -- all of its segments have excellent operating margins. The overall business notched an operating margin of more than 25% in 2023.

Story continues

Management is projectng for an even better 26% to 27% operating margin in 2024 and a 30% operating margin by 2030.

Growth concerns

ITW's main challenge has been sluggish organic growth. Its organic revenue actually declined 0.6% last quarter. ITW is forecasting for just 1% to 3% organic growth for the year and 2% to 4% revenue growth. Earnings per share (EPS) growth is expected to be a little better at 6% to 10% for a total of $10.30 to $10.70 in full-year EPS -- partially thanks to a one-off accounting change.

Zoom out a bit further, and you'll see that ITW's EPS only increased by 20.6% during the past three years. That's not a terrible growth rate for a stodgy dividend payer, but it's not exactly great, either. Revenue has grown even slower, at 14.7%. However, take a look at an even longer time frame, and you'll notice that its earnings have grown much faster than revenue -- which is a testament to ITW becoming a more efficient, higher-margin business.

ITW EPS Diluted (TTM) Chart

A leaner business with widening margins is better than an overextended model that leans heavily on sales growth at the expense of margins. But eventually, ITW will need to chart a path toward both wider margins and higher revenue, especially because there's a limit to how many efficiency improvements a business can make.

If you tune in to a typical ITW earnings call, you'll find that most of the conversation centers around margins. It might seem trivial to go back and forth about a single percentage point in margins. But ITW generated $16.1 billion in trailing 12-month revenue and $4.2 billion in operating income -- so each percentage point change in margin equates to a $160 million difference in operating income.

Since ITW is involved in so many different industries (and generates a significant amount of sales from outside North America), no company is an exact competitor. However, some companies compete with it in one or more segments. And ITW has significantly higher margins than many of these peers.

ITW Operating Margin (TTM) Chart

Despite having lower revenue than Genuine Parts, Parker Hannifin, W.W. Grainger, and Emerson Electric, ITW has the highest operating income of any company on this list. What makes it such a special company is that it combines size with wide margins across many different product categories. Conglomerates can often be bulky and inefficient, but ITW is a good example of an effective conglomerate that is benefiting from diversification.

Expect a dividend raise soon

Last August, ITW announced a 7% dividend hike to $1.40 per share per quarter. ITW typically announces its annual payout raises in the summer, with the first affected payout coming in October. Given the consistency of its dividend program, investors should expect an announcement sometime in the next couple of months.

Not all Dividend Kings use stock buybacks as a primary way to return capital to shareholders, but ITW plans to repurchase $1.5 billion of its shares this year. By comparison, it distributed $418 million in dividends last quarter -- or roughly $1.7 billion during the past year. So on the surface, ITW's 2.4% yield may not look super attractive, but its capital return program is much stronger when one factors in the buyback program.

High margins help ITW squeeze more profit from every dollar in revenue. But buying back stock reduces its share count, leading to higher earnings per share. During the past five years, it has reduced its shares outstanding by 7.8%, which has boosted EPS by 36.1% even as net income rose by 24.2%.

Buybacks have also helped keep a lid on ITW's valuation. The recent sell-off in the stock paired with steady earnings growth has dropped its price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio down to just 23.4 -- which is below its three-, five- and seven-year median P/E ratios. And ITW was trading above these key levels just a few months ago.

ITW PE Ratio Chart

ITW is a well-rounded buy

ITW is a phenomenal business, but its valuation was pricey, and its revenue growth is weak. Now that the stock has sold off, the conglomerate's only bad quality is its low sales growth.

There are nearly perfect businesses, but there's no such thing as a perfect stock. The best companies are usually expensive relative to their trailing or projected earnings, while bad companies trade at cheap levels for good reasons.

However, ITW is close to a perfect blue chip dividend stock. It is an extremely efficient business with high margins, an over 50-year track record of raising dividends, a sizable buyback program, and a reasonable valuation. The conglomerate model works well for ITW and helps the company offset much of the cyclicality of its various end markets.

Add it all up, and there's a lot to like about ITW as a top-tier Dividend King to buy and hold for years to come.

(Reuters) -BlackRock has launched a 'buffer' exchange-traded fund that seeks to offer a 100% downside hedge to risk-shy investors looking to tap the equity markets, the world's largest asset manager said on Monday.

So-called buffer or risk-managed ETFs help maximize returns from an asset for investors and simultaneously provide downside protection over a specific period.

The novel product will likely appeal to investors who are hoping to ride a rally in the stock markets as they continue to trade near record highs, but are concerned that a slowing economy and higher-for-longer interest rates can together hurt sentiment going forward.

Buffer ETFs also typically see lower redemption requests during times of heavy market volatility.

""BlackRock is not early - and actually is a little late - to the buffered ETF game, but with (the company's) size, reach, and marketing machine, it has a fair chance of catching up with and surpassing earlier market entrants,"" said Michael Ashley Schulman, partner and CIO at Running Point Capital Advisors.

""Launching buffered ETFs now, when the market is near all-time highs and many investors are nervous - especially with inflation, upcoming elections, and expanding debt - could be especially fortuitous for them,"" he added.

The iShares Large Cap Max Buffer Jun ETF started trading on Monday under the ticker symbol 'MAXJ'.

The asset manager said the ETF will track the returns of the benchmark S&P 500 using options with an upside cap, while providing a 100% hedge to all downside for roughly a year.

""With record levels of cash sitting on the sidelines, many investors are looking for tools to help navigate market volatility before they step back into the market,"" said Rachel Aguirre, head of U.S. iShares product, BlackRock.

BlackRock added that it now manages $25 billion in assets under management across more than 40 active ETFs in the United States, as of June 30.

In a recent episode of her ""Women & Money"" podcast, personal finance expert Suze Orman offered critical advice to Brett, a 35-year-old caller. Brett, who earns $93,000 annually with no debt, was concerned about his retirement savings and sought guidance on improving his financial strategy.

Don't Miss:

He explained that he maxes out his Roth IRA annually, with $14,000 currently in CDs, and contributes 5% of his income to a Roth TSP, matched by his employer, and invested in Lifecycle funds, totaling $54,000. Brett asked Orman if he should contribute more or diversify his investments, especially since he sees his peers with substantial retirement savings and feels inadequate in comparison.

Orman's first piece of advice was to stop comparing himself to others. ""The first thing you should do, Brett, is stop comparing yourself to other people. What others have, or claim to have, does not matter,"" she said. ""You only need to have the amount of money that makes you secure so that you can support yourself in retirement, your family, or whatever.""

She highlighted the mistake of investing in CDs at a young age, especially within a Roth account. ""You are too young to have any money in certificates of deposit, especially in a Roth account at the age of 35. You need to be going for growth with ETFs and individual stocks,"" Orman advised.

Trending: Elon Musk and Jeff Bezos are bullish on one city that could dethrone New York and become the new financial capital of the US. Investing in its booming real estate market has never been more accessible.

To illustrate the missed opportunity, Orman pointed out that if Brett continued investing $8,000 a year in CDs at a 5% return, he would have $600,000 after 30 years. However, if he invested the same amount in the market with ETFs at a 10% return, he could accumulate $1.7 million, which is $1.1 million more. She added, ""If you work till you are 70, you could have $2.8 million. Now, that is just your Roth IRA. At 5%, all you would have is essentially $850,000. So, what is it, Brett? You want $850,000 at the age of 70 or $2.8 million?""

Orman also advised Brett to ditch life cycle funds, which she believes limit growth potential. ""I don't like life cycle funds. I don't like target date mutual funds. Look for index funds and manage your money, investing it for growth at this age,"" she recommended. This strategy, she suggested, could easily yield $7 or $8 million by retirement.

Story continues

Orman encouraged Brett to contribute more but critiqued his current investment choices rather than the amount he saved. ""How are you doing right now? I would give you maybe a C- and not because of the amount you're saving, but because of how you are investing it.""

Orman’s advice underscores the importance of growth-oriented investments for young professionals. By avoiding conservative options like CDs and life cycle funds and focusing on ETFs and individual stocks, Orman firmly believes Brett can significantly enhance his retirement savings.

No matter what you choose, it's important to prioritize personal financial goals over comparisons and adopt strategies that maximize growth potential. For personalized advice tailored to your specific situation, consulting a financial advisor can be invaluable in ensuring your investments align with your long-term objectives.

He takes zero interest in our finances. He doesn’t even know the name of our mortgage company. What can I do?,"“When I wanted to share with him how much we have saved for retirement and our return, he said he’d rather not know.” (Photo subjects are models.) - Getty Images/iStockphoto

Dear Quentin,

My husband and I are both in our 40s with two kids. He does not seem to be interested in anything financial at all. He does not know the name of our mortgage company, the cost of our monthly mortgage payment or even our property taxes. He also is not interested in his retirement investments. I take care of all things financial.

When I wanted to share with him how much we have saved for retirement and our return, he said he’d rather not know. I manage his IRA and buy and sell stocks for both of our IRAs. I am doing really well in our retirement accounts, and my return for the past five years has been 22%. I am very glad that I have the skills to take care of our money.

Most Read from MarketWatch

I don’t like the fact that we are worlds apart in this part of our lives, and it hurts me. For example, he thinks I’m too materialistic. I look at it as being a wise steward. I am really worried that if I’m not around, he will not be able to manage the basics of everyday life for himself and our children. What should I do?

We all bring our own qualities and, yes, neuroses to our relationships — and our relationship to money is no exception. - MarketWatch illustration

Dear STEM,

He’s lucky to have you. And I’m sure the opposite is true, too. Some people don’t cook. Others are lazy when it comes to housework, even though they can do a 10-mile hike at the weekend. One person’s partner won’t want to talk about their feelings, while another will drive their spouse to distraction by giving them a rundown of every moment of their day. It’s a crapshoot.

You make sure you’re getting your 401(k) matches and investing in an IRA, keeping an emergency fund for six to 12 months’ worth of expenses, setting up tax-advantaged 529 plans for your children’s college education, putting any extra cash in a high-interest savings account or CDs to take advantage of interest rates of more than 5%, and staying out of debt.

You can’t change your husband, but you can manage your household finances the way a science or math teacher might teach students — by example. Financial avoidance is not uncommon. It is obviously more dangerous when people spend money and don’t want to think about their credit-card bills, and it can also prevent a person from saving for retirement.

Story continues

“Like a person who hates flying will avoid airplanes, or someone who has a fear of heights won’t visit the Empire State Building, people anxious about their money tend to ignore it,” according to Alliance Wealth Advisors. “The people whose job it is to work with people on their finances aren’t always helping people feel better. The focus is often on selling products,” they note.

“We are not retirement-focused robots,” Alliance says. “We all have different goals, needs, and wants, and the ‘right answer’ is different for everyone. Telling someone who wants to pay for their children’s education, start a business, or buy a home that they should be saving more for retirement is not helpful. It can also just create more anxiety.”

All of us bring our own qualities and, yes, neuroses to our relationships — and our relationship to money is no exception. Confronting your husband about his lack of financial acumen, or forcing him to read all about your investments, is tantamount to putting your dog’s nose in his No. 1 to prevent him from relieving himself inside the house — and would be even less effective.

If you were in a band and everyone played the drums instead of one musician playing the trumpet and someone else socking it to it on the guitar or piano, it would be a pretty noisy affair. The same is true for corporations and marriages: Not everyone can fulfill the same role. Your husband, perhaps because of how he was raised, may feel anxious about finances.

Working a little black magic

So what now? You’ve already done the most important part: You stepped in and took control because it’s not something your husband is willing or able to do. No doubt he pulls his weight in other areas of the relationship. Your focus is ensuring that you spend less than you earn, save for retirement, keep track of your bills and enjoy your life. Put that down on paper.

You can work a little black magic — magic to keep you in the black and help your husband stay afloat if something were to happen to you. Frame information about your finances in a positive way. “Good news, Larry! We’ve got 20 years left on our mortgage. Even better, we now pay $2,000 per month instead of $2,500 because we refinanced in 2021 at 3%. Let’s celebrate!”

It’s the financial equivalent of dipping a brussels sprout in chocolate. You can keep dipping to keep him abreast of other parts of your financial life: “Guess what, Larry? You won’t believe it! When we hit 50, we’ll be able to make catch-up contributions to our 401(k)s, currently up to $7,300 a year. Every little bit helps. Here’s a big bowl of delicious ice cream!”

Or, “Not only does our initial investment in the stock market make money, so does the interest we’ve earned on that investment. It’s the power of compounding. Isn’t that amazing? We sit back and keep accumulating funds for our retirement. They call that passive income. Why don’t we earn some passive income at the cinema and go see that movie you’ve been talking about?”

Put your household accounts in colorful folders and make sure they’re accessible. He may decide to run his fingers through them while you are out. It will also give him a road map for your finances should you become incapacitated or pass away. Those files should include life-insurance and home-insurance policies, bank-account details and standing orders.

You can also enlist the help of a financial adviser who can talk to you both about your goals and dreams, what kind of lifestyle you would like in retirement and perhaps — given my macabre references to your husband outliving you or you becoming incapacitated — explore options for long-term-care insurance. Hard conversations are important to have.

After all, life — and financial planning — is not all butterflies and rosé.

He takes zero interest in our finances. He doesn’t even know the name of our mortgage company. What can I do?,"“When I wanted to share with him how much we have saved for retirement and our return, he said he’d rather not know.” (Photo subjects are models.) - Getty Images/iStockphoto

Dear Quentin,

My husband and I are both in our 40s with two kids. He does not seem to be interested in anything financial at all. He does not know the name of our mortgage company, the cost of our monthly mortgage payment or even our property taxes. He also is not interested in his retirement investments. I take care of all things financial.

When I wanted to share with him how much we have saved for retirement and our return, he said he’d rather not know. I manage his IRA and buy and sell stocks for both of our IRAs. I am doing really well in our retirement accounts, and my return for the past five years has been 22%. I am very glad that I have the skills to take care of our money.

Most Read from MarketWatch

I don’t like the fact that we are worlds apart in this part of our lives, and it hurts me. For example, he thinks I’m too materialistic. I look at it as being a wise steward. I am really worried that if I’m not around, he will not be able to manage the basics of everyday life for himself and our children. What should I do?

We all bring our own qualities and, yes, neuroses to our relationships — and our relationship to money is no exception. - MarketWatch illustration

Dear STEM,

He’s lucky to have you. And I’m sure the opposite is true, too. Some people don’t cook. Others are lazy when it comes to housework, even though they can do a 10-mile hike at the weekend. One person’s partner won’t want to talk about their feelings, while another will drive their spouse to distraction by giving them a rundown of every moment of their day. It’s a crapshoot.

You make sure you’re getting your 401(k) matches and investing in an IRA, keeping an emergency fund for six to 12 months’ worth of expenses, setting up tax-advantaged 529 plans for your children’s college education, putting any extra cash in a high-interest savings account or CDs to take advantage of interest rates of more than 5%, and staying out of debt.

You can’t change your husband, but you can manage your household finances the way a science or math teacher might teach students — by example. Financial avoidance is not uncommon. It is obviously more dangerous when people spend money and don’t want to think about their credit-card bills, and it can also prevent a person from saving for retirement.

Story continues

“Like a person who hates flying will avoid airplanes, or someone who has a fear of heights won’t visit the Empire State Building, people anxious about their money tend to ignore it,” according to Alliance Wealth Advisors. “The people whose job it is to work with people on their finances aren’t always helping people feel better. The focus is often on selling products,” they note.

“We are not retirement-focused robots,” Alliance says. “We all have different goals, needs, and wants, and the ‘right answer’ is different for everyone. Telling someone who wants to pay for their children’s education, start a business, or buy a home that they should be saving more for retirement is not helpful. It can also just create more anxiety.”

All of us bring our own qualities and, yes, neuroses to our relationships — and our relationship to money is no exception. Confronting your husband about his lack of financial acumen, or forcing him to read all about your investments, is tantamount to putting your dog’s nose in his No. 1 to prevent him from relieving himself inside the house — and would be even less effective.

If you were in a band and everyone played the drums instead of one musician playing the trumpet and someone else socking it to it on the guitar or piano, it would be a pretty noisy affair. The same is true for corporations and marriages: Not everyone can fulfill the same role. Your husband, perhaps because of how he was raised, may feel anxious about finances.

Working a little black magic

So what now? You’ve already done the most important part: You stepped in and took control because it’s not something your husband is willing or able to do. No doubt he pulls his weight in other areas of the relationship. Your focus is ensuring that you spend less than you earn, save for retirement, keep track of your bills and enjoy your life. Put that down on paper.

You can work a little black magic — magic to keep you in the black and help your husband stay afloat if something were to happen to you. Frame information about your finances in a positive way. “Good news, Larry! We’ve got 20 years left on our mortgage. Even better, we now pay $2,000 per month instead of $2,500 because we refinanced in 2021 at 3%. Let’s celebrate!”

It’s the financial equivalent of dipping a brussels sprout in chocolate. You can keep dipping to keep him abreast of other parts of your financial life: “Guess what, Larry? You won’t believe it! When we hit 50, we’ll be able to make catch-up contributions to our 401(k)s, currently up to $7,300 a year. Every little bit helps. Here’s a big bowl of delicious ice cream!”

Or, “Not only does our initial investment in the stock market make money, so does the interest we’ve earned on that investment. It’s the power of compounding. Isn’t that amazing? We sit back and keep accumulating funds for our retirement. They call that passive income. Why don’t we earn some passive income at the cinema and go see that movie you’ve been talking about?”

Put your household accounts in colorful folders and make sure they’re accessible. He may decide to run his fingers through them while you are out. It will also give him a road map for your finances should you become incapacitated or pass away. Those files should include life-insurance and home-insurance policies, bank-account details and standing orders.

You can also enlist the help of a financial adviser who can talk to you both about your goals and dreams, what kind of lifestyle you would like in retirement and perhaps — given my macabre references to your husband outliving you or you becoming incapacitated — explore options for long-term-care insurance. Hard conversations are important to have.

After all, life — and financial planning — is not all butterflies and rosé.

Here are two outstanding dividend stocks with long histories of rewarding their shareholders with steadily rising cash payments. Both stocks can help you build your own streams of passive income.

Top dividend stock No. 1: Lockheed Martin

Lockheed Martin (NYSE: LMT) helps the U.S. government and its allies protect their citizens from a growing number of threats. The company is a vital ally in an increasingly volatile world.

As a leading defense contractor, Lockheed supplies crucial technology to the U.S. military. Here are just a few examples:

The F-35 stealth aircraft serves a crucial role in the security strategies of the Air Force, Navy, and Marines, as well as that of 18 allied nations.

The Aegis radar system is helping U.S. forces protect merchant shipping vessels from drone and missile attacks in the Red Sea.

Patriot-launched PAC-3 interceptors are enabling Ukraine to fend off Russia's aerial bombardments.

Lockheed has amassed $159 billion worth of orders for its broad array of defensive platforms. Combined with the long service lives of its key products — the F-35, for one, is expected to remain in service until at least 2080 — this massive backlog gives investors a high degree of visibility into the company's future cash flow.

Management is committed to passing much of this cash on to shareholders via stock buybacks and a steadily rising dividend. Over the past decade, Lockheed has bought back a quarter of its shares, which has boosted per-share profits for its remaining stockholders. The defense leader has also raised its cash payout for 21 straight years. Today, Lockheed's dividend yield is a solid 2.7%.

Top dividend stock No. 2: Eli Lilly

For more than 140 years, Eli Lilly (NYSE: LLY) has used cutting-edge science to help people live better. The healthcare leader's history is chock-full of medical breakthroughs, but its latest discovery could be the most impactful and profitable one yet.

Almost 70% of American adults are obese or overweight, which can lead to life-threatening illnesses like diabetes, heart disease, and strokes. Fortunately, Eli Lilly has developed a game-changing drug that makes it easier for people to lose weight.

Zepbound, the pharmaceutical pioneer's weight-management treatment for adults, activates hormone receptors that reduce appetite. Participants in a 72-week clinical trial who received the highest dose of the drug lost 48 pounds on average.

Story continues

When combined with diet and exercise, Zepbound also helped these people improve their cholesterol and blood pressure profiles. And tirzepatide, the active ingredient in Zepbound, can make it easier for adults with type 2 diabetes to control their blood sugar levels. Better still, recent studies suggest that tirzepatide could have positive effects for people with liver disease and sleep apnea.

Due to tirzepatide's many potential health benefits, CEO Dave Ricks believes it will be the most important medicine of his 28-year career. Wall Street seems to agree. Investment bank Goldman Sachs expects Eli Lilly to be a leader in an anti-obesity drug market that will soar to $130 billion by the end of the decade. The company's profits, in turn, are projected to increase by more than 60% annually over the next five years.

Yahoo Finance,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/forget-nvidia-prominent-billionaires-selling-090600863.html,2024-07-02,09:06:00 UTC,Forget Nvidia: Prominent Billionaires Are Selling It and Buying These 2 Hypergrowth Stocks Instead,"The first half of 2024 is officially in the books, and the bulls remain in firm control on Wall Street. Since this year began, the iconic Dow Jones Industrial Average, benchmark S&P 500, and widely followed Nasdaq Composite have all leaped to fresh, all-time highs.

While specific trends have been singled out as clear-cut catalysts for this bull market rally, including the rise of artificial intelligence (AI) and companies enacting stock splits, the prevailing theme has been investors' willingness to gravitate to growth stocks. This is a trend not lost by Wall Street's smartest (and richest) investors.

No later than 45 days following the end to a quarter, institutional investors with at least $100 million in assets under management (AUM) are required to file Form 13F with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). A 13F allows investors an over-the-shoulder look at what Wall Street's billionaires have been buying and selling.

The latest round of 13Fs show that billionaire money managers were especially active in high-growth stocks during the March-ended quarter. More specifically, they were busy dumping shares of Wall Street's hottest megacap growth stock and absolutely piling into two other hypergrowth companies.

C'est la vie, Nvidia!

There's probably not a hotter stock on Wall Street right now than AI kingpin Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA). At its peak two weeks ago, Nvidia briefly surpassed Microsoft and Apple to gain the title of ""most-valuable public company."" Since the start of 2023, Nvidia's market cap surged by as much as $3 trillion, which necessitated a 10-for-1 stock split last month.

The catalyst behind this monumental run in Nvidia's stock is its market-leading AI hardware. The company's AI-driven graphics processing units (GPUs) rapidly became the standard in high-compute data centers. With Nvidia set to roll out its next-generation AI-GPU architecture (Blackwell) later this year, it should have no trouble sustaining its compute advantage.

Despite this seemingly flawless ramp in its operations, eight prominent billionaire investors dumped shares of this market leader during the first quarter, including (total shares sold in parenthesis):

Philippe Laffont of Coatue Management (2,937,060 shares).

Ken Griffin of Citadel Advisors (2,462,716 shares).

Israel Englander of Millennium Management (720,004 shares).

Stanley Druckenmiller of Duquesne Family Office (441,551 shares).

John Overdeck and David Siegel of Two Sigma Investments (420,801 shares).

David Tepper of Appaloosa (348,000 shares).

Steven Cohen of Point72 Asset Management (304,505 shares).

Story continues

It's certainly plausible that these eight billionaires were simply locking in gains after a monster run higher by Nvidia. But it's also possible that headwinds are beginning to surface and becoming recognized by Wall Street's wisest billionaire money managers.

For example, Nvidia is set to face its first real bout of competition. Intel should begin shipping its Gaudi 3 AI-accelerator chip on a broad scale sometime this quarter, while Advanced Micro Devices has continued to ramp up production of its MI300X AI-GPU. With enterprise demand for AI-GPUs overwhelming supply, it shouldn't be difficult for Intel and AMD to grab market share from Nvidia.

What's more, Nvidia is facing competition from within. Its four top customers, which account for approximately 40% of its net sales, are developing AI-GPUs of their own. While these chips aren't going to outperform Nvidia's on a compute basis, the development of these chips represents a clear sign that its leading customers are aiming to lessen their reliance on the AI kingpin.

Perhaps the biggest warning for Nvidia is that every game-changing innovation and technology for 30 years has navigated its way through an early-stage bubble. This is to say that investors have consistently overestimated the adoption of next-big-thing innovations for three decades. Artificial intelligence is unlikely to break this trend.

More than a half-dozen billionaires are making waves in Sea

Although the stock market is historically pricey, Wall Street's billionaire investors did mash the buy button for a couple of hypergrowth stocks, including Singapore-based Sea Limited (NYSE: SE). Q1 saw eight billionaire asset managers buy shares (total shares purchased in parenthesis):

Steven Cohen of Point72 Asset Management (1,527,446 shares).

Philippe Laffont of Coatue Management (678,308 shares).

Chase Coleman of Tiger Global Management (675,900 shares).

John Overdeck and David Siegel of Two Sigma Investments (338,720 shares).

Leon Cooperman of Omega Advisors (240,000 shares).

Ken Griffin of Citadel Advisors (190,432 shares).

Jeff Yass of Susquehanna International (17,902 shares).

What makes Sea such an appealing investment to billionaires is that it has three unique, fast-growing operating segments.

The division that's historically been the most profitable is its digital-entertainment operations, known as ""Garena."" As you can imagine, mobile gaming was exceptionally popular during the COVID-19 pandemic. Though the percentage of paying users, relative to quarterly active users, has dipped from its peak during the height of the pandemic, the 8.2% of users who were paying customers during Q1 is many multiples higher than the pay-to-play average for the mobile-gaming industry.

The second rapidly growing operating segment is SeaMoney, which covers digital-financial services. Many of the countries Sea operates in are chronically underbanked, with consumers and businesses lacking access to digital banking and basic financial services. SeaMoney is helping to facilitate these transactions in emerging-market economies.

The third, and arguably most important, operating segment is e-commerce platform Shopee. Gross merchandise value (GMV) traversing its platform totaled $23.6 billion in Q1, which equates to $94.4 billion on an annual run rate basis. For some context, Shopee saw $10.3 billion in GMV for the entirety of 2018. This demonstrates just how quickly Sea's online marketplace has scaled and explains why billionaire investors are so excited about the company's prospects.

A trio of top-tier billionaires have gobbled up shares of Arm

The other hypergrowth stock that billionaires were busy buying instead of Nvidia is semiconductor juggernaut Arm Holdings (NASDAQ: ARM). Q1 saw three billionaires beef up their stakes or open a position, including two who were big-time sellers of Nvidia's stock (total shares purchased in parenthesis):

Ken Griffin of Citadel Advisors (1,170,604 shares).

Israel Englander of Millennium Management (424,329 shares).

Jeff Yass of Susquehanna International (127,848 shares).

Renaissance Technologies was a buyer of Arm shares as well, but I left this well-known quantitative hedge fund off the list since its billionaire founder Jim Simons passed away in May.

The allure of Arm Holdings for billionaire investors is the company's moat. Arm is responsible for designing central processing units (CPUs), GPUs, and other forms of intellectual property (IP) for which it receives royalty and licensing revenue. In other words, industry giants like Nvidia and Microsoft are using Arm designs to develop the chips that will power the training of large language models and oversee generative AI solutions for years to come. Arm brings in all of its revenue from royalties and licensing.

Aside from having the most-influential businesses utilizing its IP, Arm should benefit from developing more energy-efficient solutions for the AI revolution and data-center economy. If Arm can continue to deliver cost savings for its customers, it'll further solidify its moat as a foundational company.

Perhaps the biggest challenge Arm is going to face is convincing Wall Street and investors that its stock is worth a hefty premium. Despite surpassing Wall Street's consensus earnings-per-share (EPS) forecast in all three quarters since going public last year, Arm is currently valued at 80 times forward-year earnings. While some level of premium appears warranted given its competitive edge, a multiple of 80 times consensus EPS for the upcoming year, with revenue growth of around 20%, leaves little margin for error.

Yahoo Finance,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/3-stocks-double-again-2024-155000940.html,2024-07-02,15:50:00 UTC,3 Stocks That Can Double Again in 2024,"There are just a little more than 30 U.S. exchange-listed companies with market caps greater than $1 billion that more than doubled in the first half of this year. It's fair to say that most of them won't repeat the feat through the final six months of 2024. It doesn't mean that all of them won't deliver an encore performance.

Cava (NYSE: CAVA), Hims & Hers Health (NYSE: HIMS), and Sweetgreen (NYSE: SG) are among handful of names that have already doubled this year. They have a shot at doubling again before the end of 2024. Let's take a closer look.

1. Cava Group: Up 116%

Investors are often smart to steer clear of freshly minted IPOs, but Cava has proven to be a tasty exception to the rule. The fast-growing chain of Mediterranean fast-casual restaurants went public at $22 in the springtime of last year. It nearly doubled to $42.98 by the end of 2023. It has gone on to more than double this year, a four-bagger for those who got in on the IPO less than 13 months ago.

Cava closed out its latest fiscal quarter with 323 locations, but it's less than a third of the way to its goal of having 1,000 locations open by 2032. The brand's growing appeal and some of its unique product offerings have also translated well to the upscale grocery level as a seller of consumer packaged goods.

Growth and top-line store-level performance have slowed since Cava's first quarter as a public company when revenue soared 62% on the strength of brisk expansion and an 18.2% jump in comparable-store sales. Revenue in its latest report rose 30%, fueled largely by a 23% surge in its open locations. Comps rose a mere 2.3%, and a closer look could prove problematic. The modest comps figure is the result of a 3.5% increase from menu price and product mix, weighed down by a 1.2% decline in guest traffic.

This isn't as problematic as it seems. For starters, Cava's scalability has scored it better-than-expected profitability in every quarter as a public company. Its adjusted earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization (EBITDA) nearly doubled in its latest quarter.

Watching a hot chain go through a slowdown in traffic can be scary, but Cava actually raised its guidance when it announced its first-quarter results in late May. It was initially eyeing a 3% to 5% increase for the entire 2024 fiscal year. Now it's eyeing a 4.5% to 6.5% increase. Put another way, business is expected to pick up again at the store level to give the aggressive chain expansion more oomph.

2. Hims & Hers Health: Up 127%

The promise of telehealth is a win-win on paper. Using videoconferencing to connect someone requiring a medical consultation with a licensed or trained professional is cheaper, faster, and more discreet than conventional in-office visitations. However, the medium has generally failed to deliver profitable and sustainable growth.

Story continues

Hims & Hers Health could be the exception. Hims was founded seven years ago, initially leaning on telehealth to sell hair loss and erectile dysfunction treatments that require a medical prescription. It would go on to double its target audience by launching Hers, offering birth control and flibanserin. It would eventually tackle mental health, and earlier this year it became a source to secure the wildly popular GLP-1 weight loss injections.

Growth has been stellar. Revenue gains have clocked in at 46% or better for every quarter since the company went public three years ago. It has finally broken out of the red, clocking in with back-to-back quarters of profitable results. There are regulatory risks here if there's a crackdown on telehealth prescriptions, but it may be too late to put that genie back in the bottle.

3. Sweetgreen: Up 167%

Let's close out with another fast-growing restaurant chain. In a year in which tech and crypto dominate the names of stocks that doubled, Sweetgreen is living up to its name for its fortunate 2024 investors. The company's fast-casual eateries specializing in premium salads and warm bowls are rocking, and the stock's 167% year-to-date burst makes it one of 2024's biggest consumer-facing gainers.

Unlike Cava, Sweetgreen was a dud after its initial IPO pop. It went public at $28 in 2021, briefly trading north of $50 before whittling its way down to the high single digits by late last year. The starting line matters here. Sweetgreen is growing roughly in line with Cava these days. Revenue rose 26% in its latest quarter on a 5% uptick in comps. However, it's still not profitable.

The catalyst for continued growth here is similar to what could drive Cava higher. These are high-end fast casual concepts that appeal to young and affluent professionals. The return to in-office work should continue to drive weekday lunch traffic to both chains, and brand appeal should only continue to grow as the year plays out.

Yahoo Finance,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/stock-influencer-roaring-kitty-discloses-102219227.html,2024-07-01,10:22:19 UTC,Chewy executives alarmed at 'Roaring Kitty' stake in pet-product retailer,"By Manas Mishra, Greg Roumeliotis and Suzanne McGee

(Reuters) -Stock influencer Keith Gill, known as ""Roaring Kitty,"" unveiled a 6.6% stake in Chewy on Monday, a surprise move that alarmed executives at the U.S. pet products company. The Chewy stake is Gill's first known investment beyond GameStop. A link connects these two investments: Ryan Cohen, the billionaire founder of Chewy, is now CEO of GameStop. Gill has in the past praised Cohen in his social media posts. Cohen founded Chewy and sold it in 2017.

Gill sent GameStop shares soaring in 2021 with a series of social media posts that drew a flood of retail money into the company. Its shares have swung wildly since Gill resurfaced online in May, following a three-year hiatus.

Gill's investment raised concerns among Chewy's top brass about asset managers who are shareholders potentially being put off by the ensuing volatility in the stock fueled by Gill's army of individual investors, said a person familiar with the company's thinking. Chewy's executives and board have not spoken to Gill, the person added.

Shares in the pet supplies retailer rose as high as $30 on Monday but reversed those gains in volatile trading. They were last down 4.8% at $25.92, with more than 54 million shares trading hands, more than three times 25-day moving average volumes.

The filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission showed Gill bought 9 million shares of Chewy worth about $245 million at the stock's Friday closing price of $27.24, making him Chewy's third-largest shareholder, according to LSEG data.

It was not clear if Gill had liquidated any of his position in GameStop, which he disclosed on June 13 was 9 million shares worth at the time around $262.1 million, to fund the Chewy stake. GameStop's shares dropped 6% on Monday, but have gained 33% so far this year.

The SEC, Chewy and Gill did not respond to requests for comment.

While Gill has historically revealed his holdings through social media posts, he was required to file with the SEC in the case of Chewy because his investment exceeded 5% of the company's outstanding shares.

The SEC filing indicates Gill purchased the Chewy stake on June 24, three days before he posted a picture of a puppy on social media platform X that briefly sent Chewy shares to a near one-year high, and also sent shares in Petco and Wag up.

Separately, GameStop investors sued Gill on Friday, alleging he engaged in a ""pump-and-dump"" scheme that cost them money. Gill has denied past claims he had talked up the stock for his own gain, arguing he was ""abundantly clear"" that his aggressive investing style was unsuitable for most people.

Story continues

The Massachusetts securities regulator is probing Gill's trading activities in GameStop, Reuters and other media previously reported.

'NOT A CAT'

Once an office worker, Gill shot to fame after his cat memes and exuberant YouTube streams in which he frequently wore a bright red pirate bandana drew thousands of copycat bets on GameStop, crushing hedge funds that had bet against the stock.

In Monday's SEC filing, Gill remained on-brand, appearing to add a section that read: ""Check the appropriate box to designate whether you are a cat"" under which the descriptor ""I am not a cat"" was checked.

Gill has consistently argued that GameStop is undervalued and that its management team, led by Cohen, would turn the videogame retailer around. Gill's attraction to Chewy was not immediately obvious, although some analysts speculated Cohen's historic involvement in the company may have been a draw for Gill.

Cohen, who co-founded Chewy, took on GameStop in 2021 when he joined the board and was later elected its chairman, laying out a strategy to push the bricks and mortar retailer into e-commerce.

Cohen did not respond to a request for comment.

In his YouTube livestreams, Gill has repeatedly voiced his admiration for Cohen. ""This guy is the man!"" he exclaimed in a video dating back to January 2021, shortly after Cohen and two former Chewy colleagues joined GameStop's board. ""I'm excited about Ryan Cohen being at the helm.""

Chewy's board is not in touch with Cohen, according to the source familiar with the company's thinking.

Shares of Chewy, which sells pet food and medicine online, have risen 15% so far in 2024 but declined in the three preceding years as spending on pets slowed after a post-pandemic boom.

Trading volumes in Chewy stock options have been unusually high over the past 10 sessions, with some 158,000 contracts changing hands daily. That's nearly four times the average over the preceding year, according to a Reuters analysis of Trade Alert data.

Call options, typically bought to express a bullish view, were particularly active. Contracts betting on Chewy finishing above $30 by mid-July were the most actively traded options on the stock over the last 10 days.

Yahoo Finance,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/stock-influencer-roaring-kitty-discloses-102219227.html,2024-07-01,10:22:19 UTC,Chewy executives alarmed at 'Roaring Kitty' stake in pet-product retailer,"By Manas Mishra, Greg Roumeliotis and Suzanne McGee

(Reuters) -Stock influencer Keith Gill, known as ""Roaring Kitty,"" unveiled a 6.6% stake in Chewy on Monday, a surprise move that alarmed executives at the U.S. pet products company. The Chewy stake is Gill's first known investment beyond GameStop. A link connects these two investments: Ryan Cohen, the billionaire founder of Chewy, is now CEO of GameStop. Gill has in the past praised Cohen in his social media posts. Cohen founded Chewy and sold it in 2017.

Gill sent GameStop shares soaring in 2021 with a series of social media posts that drew a flood of retail money into the company. Its shares have swung wildly since Gill resurfaced online in May, following a three-year hiatus.

Gill's investment raised concerns among Chewy's top brass about asset managers who are shareholders potentially being put off by the ensuing volatility in the stock fueled by Gill's army of individual investors, said a person familiar with the company's thinking. Chewy's executives and board have not spoken to Gill, the person added.

Shares in the pet supplies retailer rose as high as $30 on Monday but reversed those gains in volatile trading. They were last down 4.8% at $25.92, with more than 54 million shares trading hands, more than three times 25-day moving average volumes.

The filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission showed Gill bought 9 million shares of Chewy worth about $245 million at the stock's Friday closing price of $27.24, making him Chewy's third-largest shareholder, according to LSEG data.

It was not clear if Gill had liquidated any of his position in GameStop, which he disclosed on June 13 was 9 million shares worth at the time around $262.1 million, to fund the Chewy stake. GameStop's shares dropped 6% on Monday, but have gained 33% so far this year.

The SEC, Chewy and Gill did not respond to requests for comment.

While Gill has historically revealed his holdings through social media posts, he was required to file with the SEC in the case of Chewy because his investment exceeded 5% of the company's outstanding shares.

The SEC filing indicates Gill purchased the Chewy stake on June 24, three days before he posted a picture of a puppy on social media platform X that briefly sent Chewy shares to a near one-year high, and also sent shares in Petco and Wag up.

Separately, GameStop investors sued Gill on Friday, alleging he engaged in a ""pump-and-dump"" scheme that cost them money. Gill has denied past claims he had talked up the stock for his own gain, arguing he was ""abundantly clear"" that his aggressive investing style was unsuitable for most people.

The Massachusetts securities regulator is probing Gill's trading activities in GameStop, Reuters and other media previously reported.

'NOT A CAT'

Once an office worker, Gill shot to fame after his cat memes and exuberant YouTube streams in which he frequently wore a bright red pirate bandana drew thousands of copycat bets on GameStop, crushing hedge funds that had bet against the stock.

In Monday's SEC filing, Gill remained on-brand, appearing to add a section that read: ""Check the appropriate box to designate whether you are a cat"" under which the descriptor ""I am not a cat"" was checked.

Gill has consistently argued that GameStop is undervalued and that its management team, led by Cohen, would turn the videogame retailer around. Gill's attraction to Chewy was not immediately obvious, although some analysts speculated Cohen's historic involvement in the company may have been a draw for Gill.

Cohen, who co-founded Chewy, took on GameStop in 2021 when he joined the board and was later elected its chairman, laying out a strategy to push the bricks and mortar retailer into e-commerce.

Cohen did not respond to a request for comment.

In his YouTube livestreams, Gill has repeatedly voiced his admiration for Cohen. ""This guy is the man!"" he exclaimed in a video dating back to January 2021, shortly after Cohen and two former Chewy colleagues joined GameStop's board. ""I'm excited about Ryan Cohen being at the helm.""

Chewy's board is not in touch with Cohen, according to the source familiar with the company's thinking.

Shares of Chewy, which sells pet food and medicine online, have risen 15% so far in 2024 but declined in the three preceding years as spending on pets slowed after a post-pandemic boom.

Trading volumes in Chewy stock options have been unusually high over the past 10 sessions, with some 158,000 contracts changing hands daily. That's nearly four times the average over the preceding year, according to a Reuters analysis of Trade Alert data.

Call options, typically bought to express a bullish view, were particularly active. Contracts betting on Chewy finishing above $30 by mid-July were the most actively traded options on the stock over the last 10 days.

Yahoo Finance,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/3-stocks-cathie-wood-just-123000033.html,2024-07-02,12:30:00 UTC,3 Stocks Cathie Wood Just Bought to Get Back on Track in the Second Half of 2024,"It was a rough first half of the year for Cathie Wood. The co-founder, CEO, and investor at Ark Invest saw her family of aggressive growth exchange-traded funds lose badly to the market. But she's not throwing in the towel.

Wood publishes Ark's daily transactions, and she did a fair amount of buying on Monday to kick off the second half of 2024. Some of more intriguing names she purchased this week include Palantir (NYSE: PLTR), Archer Aviation (NYSE: ACHR), and Intellia (NASDAQ: NTLA). They're all existing positions. Let's take a closer look at some of her first purchases in the second half of this year.

1. Palantir

Most of Wood's largest holdings at Ark Invest are lagging the market this year, but Palantir isn't one of them. Shares of the software solutions provider for the intelligence community have soared 50% in 2024, more than quadrupling since the start of last year. It's currently the seventh largest holding across all of Ark's funds.

Many tech providers have seen their business slow lately, but year-over-year revenue growth at Palantir has been accelerating in each of its past three quarters. The midpoint of its earlier guidance for the quarter that ended over the weekend implies that top-line gains will pick up the pace for the fourth straight financial update. The market has been bidding up stocks that have a legitimate artificial intelligence (AI) catalyst, but Palantir is actually earning its upticks with a business that is picking up the pace.

The big gains are exciting, but it also finds some Wall Street pros rethinking their enthusiasm. The last major analyst move happened less than two weeks ago, when Brian White at Moness Crespi downgraded the stock from neutral to sell on valuation concerns. He's generally concerned about AI and enterprise software stocks that have been moving higher despite an uninspiring earnings season. His $20 price target is 23% lower than where the stock was at Monday's close.

Palantir's latest guidance suggests that business will slow in the second half of this year, but momentum is on its side. One of the more encouraging trends at Palantir is how the company that once leaned almost entirely on government contract work is now thriving as it turns to Corporate America to pitch its high-tech solutions. It's working. The 40% jump it posted in commercial revenue in its latest quarter nearly doubled the 21% overall increase on the top line.

Valuations will be a concern for any stock that's a four-bagger over the past 18 months. However, don't overlook Palantir's improving fundamentals. This is more than just a play on hot market buzzwords.

2. Archer Aviation

One of Wood's purchases on Monday that isn't doing as well as Palantir this year is Archer Aviation. The stock has plummeted 44% in 2024, even though it did more than triple last year.

Wood owns a couple of companies specializing in next-gen short-distance air travel, and Archer is one of her biggest bets in this space. Archer offers electric vertical takeoff and landing (eVOTL) aircraft that it hopes will help get affluent clients around densely populated cities faster than conventional surface-hugging options.

Archer is a pre-revenue player that's naturally losing money as it scores potential lucrative partnership deals for its coming fleet of high-tech air taxis. Last month it announced plans for an air mobility network that will serve five key locations across the San Francisco area. Investors are hoping that once the fleet starts to take off, the shares will follow suit.

3. Intellia Therapeutics

Intellia Therapeutics can't seem to catch a break. Shares of the poorly performing gene-editing stock has declined 26% this year and is trading 36% lower since the start of last year. Intellia is developing some CRISPR-based therapies, and it even has a couple of them entering the critical third phase of clinical trials.

Intellia announced last week that its CFO would be stepping down. It's not a good look when the primary bean counter is leaving the company, but that doesn't mean something is amiss. Executives leave for many different reasons. As long as Intellia continues to deliver promising developments on her potential bar-raising therapies, you can't blame Wood for buying on the dip.

In a proposed class action filed Friday in Brooklyn, New York, federal court, GameStop shareholder Martin Radev sued Gill for securities fraud, claiming he was seeking to manipulate the stock for his own gain. In a court filing late Monday afternoon, Radev said he was voluntarily dismissing the lawsuit.

It’s unclear why Radev dropped the suit, and his lawyers didn’t immediately respond to requests for comment. The dismissal was without prejudice, meaning he is free to file the suit again.

Gill also didn’t respond to an email seeking comment.

One of the public faces of the 2021 meme-stock craze, Gill amassed more than a million followers across his “Roaring Kitty” YouTube channel and “DeepF***ingValue” Reddit page. He reemerged in May and again began posting about Gamestop on X, the social media platform formerly known as Twitter.

The suit alleged that Gill acquired 120,000 call options in GameStop before he began posting about the company in May. The stock, which had been trading around $17 just before Gill began to post, soared to $48.75 on May 14.

On June 2, he revealed that he owned 5 million shares of GameStop and 120,000 call options that were set to expire on June 21. By June 13, Gill’s holdings had risen to more than 9 million shares of GameStop with no outstanding call options.

Gill “quietly sold and/or exercised (i.e., dumped) all 120,000 of his GameStop call options for a large profit, seemingly to increase his own stake in GameStop stock by over 4 million shares,” Radev said in the suit.

GameStop shares have since fallen, though they’re still higher than they were before Gill’s posts. They closed at around $23 on Monday afternoon.

GameStop’s recent rise was less pronounced than during the meme-stock frenzy. The company surged more than 1,700% during one stretch in January 2021, and the stock’s stratospheric rise appeared to pit scrappy individual investors against sophisticated hedge funds that were heavily shorting the troubled mall retailer.

On Monday, Chewy Inc. shares spiked as much as 10% after Gill disclosed a 6.6% passive stake in the online pet food and product retailer.

Story continues

The filing with the US Securities and Exchange Commission came days after the investor posted a photo with a puppy without any comment on X. The post briefly sent the pet food retailer to a one-year high on Thursday.

The case is Radev v. Gill, 24-cv-04608, US District Court, Eastern District of New York.

They can buy Treasury bonds, a commodity like oil or gold, or purchase a home and let it increase in value over time. But when compared to other asset classes, stocks have delivered the highest average annual return over the last century.

One of the best aspects of putting your money to work on Wall Street is that, with thousands of stocks and exchange-traded funds (ETFs) to choose from, there's a very high probability of one or more securities matching your risk tolerance and investment goals.

Although growth stocks have driven all three major indexes to record levels in 2024, it's dividend stocks that have handily outperformed on Wall Street over the last half-century.

Image source: Getty Images.

In 2023, the investment advisors at Hartford Funds, in collaboration with Ned Davis Research, released a comprehensive report on the advantages dividend stocks bring to the table for investors. In particular, researchers compared the performance of dividend-paying companies to non-payers over the prior 50 years (1973-2023).

Based on their findings, dividend stocks averaged a 9.17% annual return over a half-century, and did so while being 6% less volatile than the broad-based S&P 500. This compares to a more modest 4.27% average annual return for non-payers, which were 18% more volatile than the benchmark index.

The biggest challenge for income seekers is avoiding a yield trap -- i.e., a company with a broken operating model whose falling share price has artificially pumped up its dividend yield. Thankfully, safe, ultra-high-yield dividend stocks do exist.

What follows are two ultra-high-yield dividend stocks -- companies with yields that are at least four times higher than the current yield (1.33%) of the S&P 500 -- that can be confidently pounced on by opportunistic income seekers in the second half of 2024.

Realty Income: 5.98% yield

The first high-octane dividend stock that investors can pile into for the second half of the year is premier retail real estate investment trust (REIT) Realty Income (NYSE: O). Realty Income doles out its dividend on a monthly basis, and has increased its payout for a jaw-dropping 107 consecutive quarters.

O Dividend Chart

As you're liable to note from Realty Income's stock chart, it hasn't participated in the current bull market rally. The reason for its poor performance over the last two years is primarily the result of monetary policy changes from the Federal Reserve.

Beginning in March 2022, the nation's central bank began undertaking its most aggressive rate-hiking cycle since the early 1980s. During this process, yields on short-term U.S. Treasury bills soared. Instead of buying various REITs, investors have opted to generate similar yields from purchasing Treasury bills, which have almost nonexistent risk to invested principal.

Story continues

However, this dynamic is unlikely to continue for much longer. Even though core inflation has remained stubbornly high, the Fed is more likely to reduce interest rates than increase them, as evidenced by the recent movement we've witnessed in Treasury bond yields. With Realty Income's yield rising to 6%, this absolutely puts this monthly dividend icon back on the radar.

What makes Realty Income the company that other retail REITs envy is its massive, but exceptionally resilient, commercial real estate (CRE) portfolio. As of the end of March, the company owned nearly 15,500 CRE properties. But here's the kicker: Approximately 90% of its total rent ""is resilient to economic downturns and/or isolated from e-commerce pressures,"" according to the company.

Realty Income's not-so-subtle secret is that it tends to lease stand-alone stores to time-tested, brand-name businesses that provide basic need goods and services. For instance, grocery stores, convenience stores, dollar stores, home improvement, drugstores, and automotive service lessees collectively account for 42% of annualized contractual rent. Consumers will need food, beverages, prescription medicines, and vehicle maintenance/repairs, regardless of how well or poorly the U.S. economy is performing.

What's more, Realty Income has a superior track record relative to other S&P 500 REITs when it comes to tenant occupancy. Since the start of this century, its median occupancy rate of 98.2% is 400 basis points higher than the median occupancy rate for S&P 500 REITs.

Another positive for current and prospective investors is that Realty Income has been fortifying its existing CRE portfolio and expanding into new channels. For instance, its January 2024 acquisition of Spirit Realty Capital was complementary to its existing CRE portfolio, but also opened doors in new industries.

Last but not least, Realty Income's stock is trading at a historically cheap valuation, relative to its future cash flow. Whereas shares have averaged a multiple of 17.3 times cash flow over the trailing-five-year period, opportunistic income seekers can buy into the Realty Income growth story right now for 11.8 times forecast cash flow in 2025.

Pfizer: 6% yield

The second ultra-high-yield dividend stock that's begging to be bought for the second half of 2024 (if not well beyond) is pharmaceutical titan Pfizer (NYSE: PFE). Although Pfizer isn't guaranteed to raise its payout on an annual basis, its current yield of 6% is safe.

Pfizer, like Realty Income, has been left in the dust by the current bull market rally. As I've pointed out previously, Pfizer's underperformance is a reflection of it being a victim of its own success.

Pfizer is one of a handful of drugmakers that successfully developed therapies for COVID-19. In 2022, the company's COVID-19 vaccine (Comirnaty) and oral therapy (Paxlovid) brought in north of $56 billion in combined revenue. This year, combined sales for these blockbuster treatments will total around $8 billion. For those of you keeping score at home, this is a $48 billion sales decline that Wall Street and investors have had to come to terms with.

However, perspective changes everything. Though COVID-19 sales aren't close to what they once were, Pfizer wasn't generating a cent in COVID-19 revenue prior to the pandemic. This estimated $8 billion in sales in 2024, coupled with organic growth from existing product lines and newly launched therapeutics, has lifted annual sales from $41.9 billion in 2020 to a mid-range estimate from $60 billion this year.

Digging a bit deeper, Pfizer's March-ended quarter saw sales, excluding COVID-19 therapies, jump by 11% on a constant-currency basis. Continued double-digit operational growth from blockbuster blood-thinning drug Eliquis suggests Pfizer's total portfolio is considerably stronger now than it was four years ago.

Another reason for current and prospective investors to be excited about the future is Pfizer's $43 billion acquisition of cancer-drug developer Seagen, which closed in December. Despite buyout-related costs weighing on Pfizer's 2024 earnings per share (EPS), this combination should result in meaningful cost savings and improved EPS in 2025 and beyond. Moreover, this deal vastly expands Pfizer's oncology pipeline and provides a greater-than $3 billion boost to annual sales right off the bat.

Like Realty Income, Pfizer has macro factors in its corner. Since we have no control over when we become ill or what ailment(s) we develop, demand for everything from prescription medicines to devices tends to remain constant in any economic climate. The point is that Pfizer is highly resistant to economic downturns.

The final piece of the puzzle is that Pfizer's stock is cheaper than it's been in a very long time. Shares of the company recently hit their lowest level in a decade. Further, shares are valued at roughly 10 times forward-year earnings, which is modestly lower than the average multiple of 11 times forward-year EPS that Pfizer's stock has traded at over the prior five years.

Pfizer, like Realty Income, has been left in the dust by the current bull market rally. As I've pointed out previously, Pfizer's underperformance is a reflection of it being a victim of its own success.

Pfizer is one of a handful of drugmakers that successfully developed therapies for COVID-19. In 2022, the company's COVID-19 vaccine (Comirnaty) and oral therapy (Paxlovid) brought in north of $56 billion in combined revenue. This year, combined sales for these blockbuster treatments will total around $8 billion. For those of you keeping score at home, this is a $48 billion sales decline that Wall Street and investors have had to come to terms with.

However, perspective changes everything. Though COVID-19 sales aren't close to what they once were, Pfizer wasn't generating a cent in COVID-19 revenue prior to the pandemic. This estimated $8 billion in sales in 2024, coupled with organic growth from existing product lines and newly launched therapeutics, has lifted annual sales from $41.9 billion in 2020 to a mid-range estimate from $60 billion this year.

Digging a bit deeper, Pfizer's March-ended quarter saw sales, excluding COVID-19 therapies, jump by 11% on a constant-currency basis. Continued double-digit operational growth from blockbuster blood-thinning drug Eliquis suggests Pfizer's total portfolio is considerably stronger now than it was four years ago.

Another reason for current and prospective investors to be excited about the future is Pfizer's $43 billion acquisition of cancer-drug developer Seagen, which closed in December. Despite buyout-related costs weighing on Pfizer's 2024 earnings per share (EPS), this combination should result in meaningful cost savings and improved EPS in 2025 and beyond. Moreover, this deal vastly expands Pfizer's oncology pipeline and provides a greater-than $3 billion boost to annual sales right off the bat.

Like Realty Income, Pfizer has macro factors in its corner. Since we have no control over when we become ill or what ailment(s) we develop, demand for everything from prescription medicines to devices tends to remain constant in any economic climate. The point is that Pfizer is highly resistant to economic downturns.

The final piece of the puzzle is that Pfizer's stock is cheaper than it's been in a very long time. Shares of the company recently hit their lowest level in a decade. Further, shares are valued at roughly 10 times forward-year earnings, which is modestly lower than the average multiple of 11 times forward-year EPS that Pfizer's stock has traded at over the prior five years.

The latchkey kids are all grown up.

The oldest members of Generation X — that generation born between 1965 and 1980 and known for its irreverence, sarcasm and indifference — are hitting 59½ and eligible to start withdrawing money from retirement accounts without penalty. But should they be touching their nest eggs so soon?

Most Read from MarketWatch

As the first do-it-yourself generation funding retirement largely without private pension plans, many members of Gen X graduated college or high school during a recession. They got their first jobs when 401(k)s were in their infancy and predated the internet with paper statements mailed weeks after a quarter ended.

The early 401(k) plans, if they were offered by employers at all, were unsophisticated and lacked tools for education. Those early plans also lacked automatic enrollment, automatic escalation of savings allocations and target-date funds — all factors making it easier to save nowadays.

It was not an auspicious beginning to funding retirements that could stretch over decades.

“Generation X represents a pivotal transition in our evolving retirement landscape,” said Catherine Collinson, chief executive of the nonprofit Transamerica Institute and Transamerica Center for Retirement Studies, or TCRS. “Many Gen X–ers may be on a collision course. However, I believe there are options for course corrections.”

Generation X has median retirement savings of $93,000, according to a new study by the Transamerica Institute and TCRS. Only 16% of Gen X is are “very” confident of being able to fully retire with a comfortable lifestyle, the study found. Just 21% of Gen X members strongly agreed that they are building a large enough retirement nest egg.

“59½ is a milestone birthday with regards to saving and planning,” Collinson said. “It’s time for Generation X to do a lot of homework, which can positively influence their retirement outcome.”

Collinson said Gen X–ers need to focus on keeping job skills fresh and understanding what their employers need so they can work as long as they need to. Exploring ways to boost income and cut expenses is also key. Learning ahead of time the complex details of Medicare, which provides healthcare coverage starting at 65, will be crucial as well, she said.

“Getting ready for retirement takes on a real urgency during the final years of your career,” said Bryan Pinsky, president of individual retirement at Corebridge Financial. “Your financial situation is probably at its strongest, but your window for preparation is closing.”

In addition to saving for retirement, Generation X also may be juggling competing financial pressures such as helping aging parents and putting children through college. Such complications could call for a financial adviser or at least some serious at-home budgeting and planning efforts, experts said.

American adults believe they will need $1.46 million to retire comfortably, according to Northwestern Mutual’s 2024 Planning & Progress Study. That makes for a big gap between the median actual balance and the sum people think they need.

“What does it mean to be behind? How would you know if you are behind if you don’t have a plan? The numbers are emotional or are what they think or expect they will need, as opposed to doing the planning to determine your personal retirement number,” said Rob Williams, managing director of financial planning at Charles Schwab.

Less than half (44%) of Gen X is very confident in its ability to manage day-to-day financial priorities, and just 28% could pay for an unexpected expense, according to research from Corebridge Financial. Just 32% of Gen X–ers are confident that they can manage their retirement money to provide income for as long as they live, according to Corebridge, and nearly two in three are concerned both about quality of life and running out of money if they were to live to 100.

“Save more. Save as much as you can,” Williams said. “The trend over the last decades has been away from pension plans towards more responsibility of the individual to save and invest. That means Gen X needs to take ownership for the retirement they envision.”

While advisers suggest working longer or working part-time in retirement to extend any nest-egg funds, many people retire before they planned to due to health reasons, caregiving needs or job disruptions. The median age for retirement among existing U.S. retirees is 62, according to a 2024 MassMutual survey.

“That’s not far off — that’s a blink away for Gen X,” Collinson said. “The experience of current retirees should be a cautionary tale for Generation X.”

Although 62 is the earliest age at which you can collect Social Security benefits, the age at which you can claim your full benefits is 67 for Generation X or anyone born after 1960. Almost eight in 10 Generation X workers (79%) are concerned Social Security will not be there for them when they are ready to retire, while 29% are expecting Social Security to be their primary source of retirement income, according to the Transamerica Institute and TCRS report.

As far as tapping retirement funds at the age of 59½, Collinson said the ramifications for your overall retirement strategy are so complicated that it’s “surgical.” She suggested finding a financial adviser but cautioned that it’s crucial to take ownership of your financial affairs, even if you have an adviser. “No one cares more about your nest egg than you do,” she noted.

Although you can withdraw money from an IRA or 401(k) after age 59½, you’ll need to pay income taxes on the withdrawals you make. For Roth IRAs, the account must have been open for at least five years, but you can withdraw money tax- and penalty-free at 59½.

“It’s your nest egg,” Collinson said. “Handle it with great care.”

Microsoft Corp (NASDAQ:MSFT) CEO Satya Nadella has made the Redmond software giant the biggest beneficiary of the AI revolution thanks to his vision and strategy. In 2019, when Microsoft invested $1 billion in OpenAI, the company behind ChatGPT, hardly anyone noticed. But when ChatGPT was launched and the floodgates of generative AI innovation opened, Microsoft was seen as the leader in the AI arms race. Microsoft’s investments in OpenAI have now swelled to $13 billion. The company's long list of AI catalysts includes the revival of Bing Search, AI assistant Co-pilot, and AI PCs, among many others.

Is MSFT Overvalued?

However, some believe the stock has run too much and needs a breather amid Wall Street's growing concerns that just a handful of companies now account for most of the market gains. Morgan Stanley's Lisa Shalett recently said in a note that the Magnificent Seven group of stocks, including MSFT, is poised to see ""radical deceleration"" in earnings growth, according to a report by Seeking Alpha. Goldman Sachs equity strategist David Kostin calculates that Microsoft's sales growth in the second quarter will come in at 15%, down from 17% in the previous quarter, as per another report by Seeking Alpha. The company is expected to report earnings on July 23. As the company gets too much spotlight and AI expectations from the stock are too high, any decline in growth in the upcoming earnings could cause the stock to fall.

There are always undervalued players in the market for those who know where to look. Let's discuss an AI underdog that analysts believe has more upside based on its strong growth catalysts.

Tweaktown reports that the company's long list of customers includes tech giants like Apple, Nvidia, Qualcomm, AMD, and Broadcom, among many others. The AI revolution is expected further to bolster Taiwan Semiconductor's demand and market share. According to Tweaktown's report, the company has a whopping 70% to 80% share of the 5nm semiconductor market and a 90% share of the 3nm chips market. Data from consultancy firm TrendForce shows that Taiwan Semiconductor had a 60% share of the global foundry market as of 2021.

Taiwan Semiconductor's AI Revenue Growth Projections

Taiwan Semiconductor's chips are used in everything from smartphones to electric car sensors and PCs. However, the huge demand for high-end chips unlocked by the generative AI boom has made TSM a promising AI stock. During a first quarter earnings call, Taiwan Semiconductor's management said it expects revenue contribution from AI processors to double this year and account for low-teens percent of total revenue. Revenue from AI is expected to grow at a 50% CAGR over the next five years and account for over 20% of the company's total revenue by 2028.

Taiwan Semiconductor's Moat in the Industry

Taiwan Semiconductor's moat in the AI chips industry is strong and wide. Firstly, the high-end chip manufacturing industry isn't easy to enter, even for major companies. Blackridge Research and Consulting firm reports that establishing a single 3nm fab could cost up to $20 billion. On top of that, Taiwan Semiconductor's real strength lies in churning millions of chips with almost no defects — the company's yield is over 95%, according to the Atlantic Council. Only Samsung is expected to come close to Taiwan Semiconductor's quality and manufacturing capability in the coming years amid its huge investments and plans to foray into the fab industry. Other than Taiwan Semiconductor, it has no formidable competitors.

Don’t Miss: Elon Musk and Jeff Bezos are bullish on one city that could dethrone New York. Investing in its booming real estate market has never been more accessible.

Is the China Threat Overblown?

Despite its dominance in the AI chips industry, Taiwan Semiconductor's share price growth has been capped, and its valuation still looks attractive compared to its peers. The stock's forward P/E is 27.7 (47 for Nvidia and 46 for AMD). The biggest concern around TSM is a possible Chinese escalation against Taiwan since the company's major manufacturing operations are based in Taiwan. However, many analysts believe these concerns are overblown and the company has no short-term risks. They say China cannot afford to go into a direct conflict with the US. According to a report by the Hudson Institute, any disruption in Taiwan's semiconductor industry could result in a $1.6 trillion economic loss to the US. Taiwan Semiconductor's chip industry dominance is seen as a ‘Silicon Shield' for Taiwan, which the country can use to deter attacks. Earlier this month, Taiwan Semiconductor's Chairman and CEO C.C. Wei said that it's ""impossible"" to move chip manufacturing outside of Taiwan and that 80% to 90% of chip manufacturing remains in the country.

Wall Street Thinks AI Boom Will Benefit Taiwan Semiconductor

Wall Street is also growing bullish on the company. Recently, Bernstein analyst Mark Li said that high-end phones and advanced nodes could result in Taiwan Semiconductor topping its 2024 guidance. The analyst thinks the company’s data center revenue is growing as expected. Li increased his price target for TSM to $200 from $150. He expects Taiwan Semiconductor's revenue to increase by 25% and EPS by 28% in 2024. Earlier this month, BofA's Brad Lin also increased his price target for TSM to $180. Lin thinks new AI plans revealed by Apple and other companies at the Computex 2024 event would drive the on-device AI trend, benefiting TSMC, which the analyst called the ""key enabler"" of AI prosperity.

There Are Better High-Yield Opportunities

The current high-interest-rate environment has created an incredible opportunity for income-seeking investors to earn massive yields, but not through dividend stocks... Certain private market real estate investments are giving retail investors the opportunity to capitalize on these high-yield opportunities and Benzinga has identified some of the most attractive options for you to consider.

For instance, Basecamp Alpine Notes offers a target APY of 9% with a term of only three months, making it a powerful short-term cash management tool with incredible flexibility. EquityMultiple has issued 61 Alpine Notes Series and has met all payment and funding obligations with no missed or late interest payments. With a low minimum investment of just $1,000, Basecamp Alpine Notes makes it easier than ever to start building a high-yield portfolio.

Microsoft Corp (NASDAQ:MSFT) CEO Satya Nadella has made the Redmond software giant the biggest beneficiary of the AI revolution thanks to his vision and strategy. In 2019, when Microsoft invested $1 billion in OpenAI, the company behind ChatGPT, hardly anyone noticed. But when ChatGPT was launched and the floodgates of generative AI innovation opened, Microsoft was seen as the leader in the AI arms race. Microsoft’s investments in OpenAI have now swelled to $13 billion. The company's long list of AI catalysts includes the revival of Bing Search, AI assistant Co-pilot, and AI PCs, among many others.

Is MSFT Overvalued?

However, some believe the stock has run too much and needs a breather amid Wall Street's growing concerns that just a handful of companies now account for most of the market gains. Morgan Stanley's Lisa Shalett recently said in a note that the Magnificent Seven group of stocks, including MSFT, is poised to see ""radical deceleration"" in earnings growth, according to a report by Seeking Alpha. Goldman Sachs equity strategist David Kostin calculates that Microsoft's sales growth in the second quarter will come in at 15%, down from 17% in the previous quarter, as per another report by Seeking Alpha. The company is expected to report earnings on July 23. As the company gets too much spotlight and AI expectations from the stock are too high, any decline in growth in the upcoming earnings could cause the stock to fall.

There are always undervalued players in the market for those who know where to look. Let's discuss an AI underdog that analysts believe has more upside based on its strong growth catalysts.

Yahoo Finance,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/buy-broadcom-july-12-stock-094000694.html,2024-07-02,09:40:00 UTC,Should You Buy Broadcom Before or After the July 12 Stock Split? 1 Detail Gives Us the Answer.,"A wide range of companies have announced stock splits this year after their share prices soared. When these events take place, companies issue additional shares to current stockholders, which lowers the price of each individual share proportionally. The goal is to make it easier for a wider range of investors to buy that particular stock.

Broadcom (NASDAQ: AVGO) has scheduled its 10-for-1 stock split for after the close of trading on July 12; shares will begin trading on a split-adjusted basis as of the opening bell on July 15. The semiconductor and networking giant has benefited from the artificial intelligence (AI) boom, which boosted demand for its AI networking and custom accelerators. That lifted its revenues, and the stock price followed. It has gained nearly 90% over the past year and surpassed $1,800 for a time in June.

This top tech stock would make a solid long-term investment, but now the question is: Should you get in on the shares before the July 12 stock split or after? Let's consider arguments for both strategies -- and discover the one detail that offers us an answer.

Image source: Getty Images.

The case for buying before the split

A stock split doesn't change anything fundamental about a company or its stock. Though the per-share price will be lower, the maneuver doesn't impact valuation in any real way. That means that post-split, the stock actually could be more expensive than it was beforehand. This happened with Nvidia recently -- between the day it made its split announcement and the actual day of the event, the tech giant's shares climbed by nearly 30%.

So if you consider Broadcom a strong long-term player, it would be a great idea to go ahead and buy the stock now rather than waiting for it to complete what is simply a piece of financial juggling.

And there are reasons to be optimistic about Broadcom. The combination of strong AI-related demand and its recent acquisition of cloud software company VMware look set to drive a new era of growth for the company. In its latest reported fiscal quarter, its revenue rose 43% to more than $12 billion thanks to these two elements. Since we're in the early days of the AI boom and VMware integration, there's likely a lot more growth to come.

VMware revenue, from about $2.1 billion in Broadcom's fiscal first quarter, grew to $2.7 billion in its fiscal Q2 (which ended May 5), and management expects it to reach a $4 billion quarterly revenue run rate. And Broadcom forecasts AI revenue for fiscal 2024 of more than $11 billion.

The case for buying after the split

The argument for buying after the split is pretty straightforward too. True, post-split, Broadcom won't necessarily be any cheaper than it is today (unless the stock falls, and stock movements will be unrelated to the split). But a lower price could make it easier for some investors to buy the stock because if you plan on investing less than the stock's current share price, you will be able to do so without relying on fractional shares.

Story continues

So, for example, today if you want to invest $500 in Broadcom and don't have the option through your broker of buying fractional shares (or if you choose not to), you won't be able to directly invest in the company. I say ""directly"" because you can always gain exposure to Broadcom through the many index funds and exchange-traded funds that include the stock in their holdings.

But if you want to avoid the fractional share route, you're probably better off buying the shares post-split.

What should you do?

Both of these arguments are logical -- so which should you follow? Since the split is right around the corner, the decision should come down to the funds you have available to invest. If you plan on investing the amount of Broadcom's current share price or more, there's no reason to wait -- now is a great time to get in on this top AI player.

However, if you're planning on investing less than the current share price, it may be a good idea to invest right after the stock split as you'll more easily be able to access full shares. Fractional shares are fine, but if your brokerage doesn't offer them, trying to get in on Broadcom today may be complicated. After the split, though, you won't have to worry about this.

But what if the stock rises or falls in the coming days, pushing valuation higher or lower? If you're a long-term investor, this won't matter for you, because it won't have much of an impact on your returns a few years down the road. It's impossible to reliably time the market so that you can buy any particular stock at its lowest price. But that's OK. Generally, buying a strong company at a fair price offers you a great chance of generating attractive returns over the long run.

And before or after the upcoming stock split, Broadcom should make a compelling AI growth buy.

When these events take place, companies issue additional shares to current stockholders, which lowers the price of each individual share proportionally. The goal is to make it easier for a wider range of investors to buy that particular stock.

Broadcom (NASDAQ: AVGO) has scheduled its 10-for-1 stock split for after the close of trading on July 12; shares will begin trading on a split-adjusted basis as of the opening bell on July 15. The semiconductor and networking giant has benefited from the artificial intelligence (AI) boom, which boosted demand for its AI networking and custom accelerators. That lifted its revenues, and the stock price followed. It has gained nearly 90% over the past year and surpassed $1,800 for a time in June.

This top tech stock would make a solid long-term investment, but now the question is: Should you get in on the shares before the July 12 stock split or after? Let's consider arguments for both strategies -- and discover the one detail that offers us an answer.

The case for buying before the split

A stock split doesn't change anything fundamental about a company or its stock. Though the per-share price will be lower, the maneuver doesn't impact valuation in any real way. That means that post-split, the stock actually could be more expensive than it was beforehand. This happened with Nvidia recently -- between the day it made its split announcement and the actual day of the event, the tech giant's shares climbed by nearly 30%.

So if you consider Broadcom a strong long-term player, it would be a great idea to go ahead and buy the stock now rather than waiting for it to complete what is simply a piece of financial juggling.

And there are reasons to be optimistic about Broadcom. The combination of strong AI-related demand and its recent acquisition of cloud software company VMware look set to drive a new era of growth for the company. In its latest reported fiscal quarter, its revenue rose 43% to more than $12 billion thanks to these two elements. Since we're in the early days of the AI boom and VMware integration, there's likely a lot more growth to come.

VMware revenue, from about $2.1 billion in Broadcom's fiscal first quarter, grew to $2.7 billion in its fiscal Q2 (which ended May 5), and management expects it to reach a $4 billion quarterly revenue run rate. And Broadcom forecasts AI revenue for fiscal 2024 of more than $11 billion.

The case for buying after the split

The argument for buying after the split is pretty straightforward too. True, post-split, Broadcom won't necessarily be any cheaper than it is today (unless the stock falls, and stock movements will be unrelated to the split). But a lower price could make it easier for some investors to buy the stock because if you plan on investing less than the stock's current share price, you will be able to do so without relying on fractional shares.

Story continues

So, for example, today if you want to invest $500 in Broadcom and don't have the option through your broker of buying fractional shares (or if you choose not to), you won't be able to directly invest in the company. I say ""directly"" because you can always gain exposure to Broadcom through the many index funds and exchange-traded funds that include the stock in their holdings.

But if you want to avoid the fractional share route, you're probably better off buying the shares post-split.

What should you do?

Both of these arguments are logical -- so which should you follow? Since the split is right around the corner, the decision should come down to the funds you have available to invest. If you plan on investing the amount of Broadcom's current share price or more, there's no reason to wait -- now is a great time to get in on this top AI player.

However, if you're planning on investing less than the current share price, it may be a good idea to invest right after the stock split as you'll more easily be able to access full shares. Fractional shares are fine, but if your brokerage doesn't offer them, trying to get in on Broadcom today may be complicated. After the split, though, you won't have to worry about this.

But what if the stock rises or falls in the coming days, pushing valuation higher or lower? If you're a long-term investor, this won't matter for you, because it won't have much of an impact on your returns a few years down the road. It's impossible to reliably time the market so that you can buy any particular stock at its lowest price. But that's OK. Generally, buying a strong company at a fair price offers you a great chance of generating attractive returns over the long run.

And before or after the upcoming stock split, Broadcom should make a compelling AI growth buy.

Most Read from Bloomberg

CityVet, one of the Dallas developer’s tenants at the time, built an expansive boarding space for a few hundred thousand dollars — about the same as it cost De Leon to develop a single hotel room. He offered in 2014 to help it expand with his capital and real estate knowledge. By the time he exited his stake in 2022, CityVet had grown from five to 25 locations.

The investment piqued his interest in wellness broadly, and his 100-person Leon Capital group now manages a portfolio of businesses ranging from pediatric dentistry to cardiology to medical spas. Those generate more than $800 million in revenue annually and make up the majority of his $1.6 billion fortune, valued for the first time by the Bloomberg Billionaires Index.

De Leon, 45, invests his own capital alongside medical professionals, building out administrative, technology, staffing and supply chain services to networks of practices. He says what he’s doing is different from private equity, which has plowed money into the health-care industry over the past decade in a bid to increase efficiency and boost profit.

“The private equity playbook involves overpaying for established businesses, using excessive leverage and then cutting costs quickly to flip a business in a prescribed timeline,” De Leon said in an interview from South Padre Island, Texas. “We build companies from the ground up, we don’t have any investors, we don’t have a timeline for selling or holding.”

De Leon, who spoke hours before a SpaceX rocket launch he planned to watch, said among his most interesting investments is Turnwell, a mental health network he started to treat the rise in anxiety and depression.

He has also invested in startups, like Crexi, a real estate technology service that was valued at $500 million in a 2022 funding round. De Leon said he expects it to go public in the next few years at a multi-billion-dollar valuation.

Being a billionaire is a long way from De Leon’s upbringing in Matamoros, Mexico, where he grew up sharing a room with five older siblings. Unlike them, he was born across the border in Brownsville, Texas, making him an American citizen and allowing him to attend its schools.

Story continues

Learning English helped him land a translation job after the signing of the North American Free Trade Agreement, when US developers were looking to scoop up real estate across the border.

Napkin Deal

One such developer was set to build a warehouse but was missing a jobs permit. De Leon, whose family had been in Matamoras for generations, said he leveraged a connection with the head of the local labor union to secure a note on a napkin promising him the jobs permit. De Leon exchanged that napkin for a 10% equity stake in the project, and by 18 he’d made enough to get his family out of poverty, he said.

He went on to win a scholarship to Harvard University and then an investment banking job with Goldman Sachs Group Inc. in New York starting in 2001. But after getting a poor internal review, he started developing property in Dallas.

That business has changed in the last two decades, with private equity and sovereign wealth funds crowding out smaller investors like himself, De Leon said. He now avoids bidding on most established property because he can’t compete on cost of capital. Instead, he gets creative with his offers.

He recently completed the Soltra Kierland, a 202-unit luxury residential project in Scottsdale, Arizona. While he didn’t offer the highest price for what was formerly a commercial building, he was confident enough in his financing, relationships in the area and his understanding of the market to put in an offer that waived zoning contingencies.

“The manufacturing of housing is incredibly complex if done correctly,” he says. But if you have the ability to “take a piece of land that’s $10 million and build a $100 million housing complex, the Blackstones, the Starwoods of the world, will reward us very well for that.”

Not all of his bets have paid off. His investment in crypto firm Core Scientific Inc. had huge paper profits after the company went public in a SPAC merger at a $4.3 billion valuation in 2021. But about a year later, amid plummeting crypto prices, it declared bankruptcy.

“It’s difficult to see when you’re in a euphoric bubble,” De Leon said. “Thankfully, when those situations occurred, my bets have been much smaller.”

He says he commits more when he grasps businesses better, like a 2013 investment with Ross Perot Jr.’s Hillwood in European logistics when the continent was still reeling from the financial and sovereign debt crises. He put about a third of his net worth into the wager.

In a full-circle moment, De Leon is now at the early stages of building his own logistics business in Mexico to capitalize on demand from the nearshoring trend.

“Mexico is an incredibly young country with lots of available employment and a reasonably stable government,” he said. “It’s important to us now and for the future.”

He went on to win a scholarship to Harvard University and then an investment banking job with Goldman Sachs Group Inc. in New York starting in 2001. But after getting a poor internal review, he started developing property in Dallas.

That business has changed in the last two decades, with private equity and sovereign wealth funds crowding out smaller investors like himself, De Leon said. He now avoids bidding on most established property because he can’t compete on cost of capital. Instead, he gets creative with his offers.

He recently completed the Soltra Kierland, a 202-unit luxury residential project in Scottsdale, Arizona. While he didn’t offer the highest price for what was formerly a commercial building, he was confident enough in his financing, relationships in the area and his understanding of the market to put in an offer that waived zoning contingencies.

“The manufacturing of housing is incredibly complex if done correctly,” he says. But if you have the ability to “take a piece of land that’s $10 million and build a $100 million housing complex, the Blackstones, the Starwoods of the world, will reward us very well for that.”

Not all of his bets have paid off. His investment in crypto firm Core Scientific Inc. had huge paper profits after the company went public in a SPAC merger at a $4.3 billion valuation in 2021. But about a year later, amid plummeting crypto prices, it declared bankruptcy.

“It’s difficult to see when you’re in a euphoric bubble,” De Leon said. “Thankfully, when those situations occurred, my bets have been much smaller.”

He says he commits more when he grasps businesses better, like a 2013 investment with Ross Perot Jr.’s Hillwood in European logistics when the continent was still reeling from the financial and sovereign debt crises. He put about a third of his net worth into the wager.

In a full-circle moment, De Leon is now at the early stages of building his own logistics business in Mexico to capitalize on demand from the nearshoring trend.

“Mexico is an incredibly young country with lots of available employment and a reasonably stable government,” he said. “It’s important to us now and for the future.”

The income it provides can be the difference between being able to enjoy your golden years and not having enough money to make ends meet.

For some, the program's spousal benefits option can significantly boost a household's Social Security income. Those benefits can be worth up to half of the higher-earning spouse's full retirement benefit. But the rules regarding this benefit for low- or non-earning spouses can make calculating when each member of a couple should claim Social Security a lot more complicated.

If you're considering claiming spousal benefits in retirement, you need to know the following three rules -- some of which may surprise you.

Image source: Getty Images.

1. Spousal benefits are only available to you if your spouse is also taking their benefits

You can't claim spousal benefits until your spouse has applied for benefits on their own earnings record. That can make planning when to claim benefits more difficult for couples who are around the same age or when the lower-earning spouse is older.

For example, as a couple, you may want to have the higher-earning spouse postpone claiming their benefits until they turn 70, which will maximize their monthly benefits and the benefits the surviving spouse will receive. However, that could come at the cost of the lower-earning spouse receiving lower benefits (or possibly no benefits at all) for a long time beforehand.

The good news is the Social Security Administration offers everyone estimates of what their benefits will be in retirement. You can use that data to see how various claiming strategies would impact your household income and revise your plans accordingly. Sitting down with a financial planner could help you determine the best claiming strategy for you and your spouse.

2. You don't get any extra spousal benefits for delaying past full retirement age

You may already know you can maximize your personal retirement benefit by waiting until age 70 to claim it. That's because the Social Security Administration offers delayed retirement credits for each month you postpone taking benefits beyond your full retirement age.

But that only applies to your personal benefit. Spousal benefits don't receive any delayed retirement credits, so they max out when the beneficiary reaches full retirement age.

With that in mind, the maximum possible spousal benefit is equal to 50% of your spouse's primary insurance amount, or PIA, which is the amount they're entitled to at full retirement age.

Story continues

What the government defines as your full retirement age depends on when you were born. Those born in 1954 or earlier reached full retirement age at 66. But the full retirement age has increased by two months for each year someone was born after 1954 until topping out at 70 for those born in 1960 or later. That means anyone born in 1957 or earlier has already reached full retirement age.

If you're planning to take spousal Social Security benefits, it rarely makes sense to delay applying for them beyond your full retirement age. Even if you won't be eligible for spousal benefits until your spouse applies, you can still receive the benefits you are entitled to based on your own work history while you wait.

3. There's a steeper penalty for claiming spousal benefits early

You can claim Social Security retirement benefits as early as 62 in most cases, but the government reduces the size of your monthly checks if you claim before reaching full retirement age. The reductions for claiming spousal benefits early are even steeper than those for claiming your personal benefit early. The only exception is if you're caring for a qualifying child (one who is 16 or younger or a child on disability benefits) of your spouse's.

The following table shows how claiming early would impact personal and spousal benefits for someone with a full retirement age of 67.

Age When Claiming Percentage of Personal PIA Percentage of Spouse's PIA 62 70% 32.5% 63 75% 35% 64 80% 37.5% 65 86.7% 41.7% 66 93.3% 45.8% 67 100% 50%

Data source: Social Security Administration. Calculations by author.

For each month before your full retirement age that you claim your spousal benefit, that benefit is reduced by 25/36 of a percentage point (about 0.69%) for up to 36 months. By comparison, your personal benefit only gets reduced by 5/9 of a percentage point (about 0.56%) for the first 36 months. Both are reduced by an additional 5/12 of a percentage point (about 0.42%) per month beyond 36 months.

While each person's individual situation will be unique, most retirees would maximize their monthly household income in retirement by delaying their Social Security applications for as long as doing so increases their benefits. That's until full retirement age for those planning to take spousal benefits and until 70 for the higher-earning spouse.

President Biden is pushing for significant changes to make big corporations pay more taxes and quadruple the tax on stock buybacks, which benefit wealthy investors and CEOs with low-tax payouts. He wants to raise the corporate tax rate to 28% and the corporate minimum tax to 21%.

Don't Miss:

Amid the ongoing EV revolution, previously overlooked low-income communities now harbor a huge investment opportunity at just $500.

Elon Musk and Jeff Bezos are bullish on one city that could dethrone New York and become the new financial capital of the US. Investing in its booming real estate market has never been more accessible.

Biden's plan aims to fix the problem of big companies paying little to no taxes, which many Americans find unfair. The goal is to have these large corporations contribute more to the country's finances, which can be used for public services and infrastructure. However, not everyone thinks this is a good idea.

Kevin O'Leary, a business owner and TV personality, recently said raising the corporate tax rate to 28% would make the U.S. the least competitive country in the G7.

O’Leary explained, ""Tax rates matter. You heard Trump talk about 15 to 21 percent. Add three to four for each state, and you get into the range of 21 to 24, 25 for U.S. corporate tax. That’s sort of in the middle of the road regarding the competition. Not the best, but if you go to 28 and add four percent, you are the most uncompetitive country in the G7.""

This isn’t the first time O’Leary has criticized increasing corporate tax rates. A few years ago, he warned that such hikes would stifle economic growth by making it harder for U.S. companies to compete with businesses in other countries, which could slow down the economy and reduce job creation.

Trending: Warren Buffett once said, ""If you don't find a way to make money while you sleep, you will work until you die."" These high-yield real estate notes that pay 7.5% – 9% make earning passive income easier than ever.

On the other hand, the International Monetary Fund (IMF) has raised concerns about the impact of artificial intelligence on inequality, urging governments to protect their economies.

In a recent report, the IMF said it is really worried about big changes in the job market and more inequality as AI becomes more common. It thinks countries should improve unemployment benefits and prepare for job losses, especially in higher-skilled jobs, which is different from past technological changes.

Instead of imposing special taxes on AI, the IMF suggested raising taxes on capital gains, profits, and corporate income to address wealth inequality.

""We want people to be able to benefit more broadly from the potential that this technology holds, and we want to ensure that there are opportunities created for people,"" said Era Dabla-Norris, Deputy Director at the IMF’s Fiscal Affairs Department and co-author of the report, for the Financial Times.

Elon Musk and Jeff Bezos are bullish on one city that could dethrone New York and become the new financial capital of the US. Investing in its booming real estate market has never been more accessible.

Biden's plan aims to fix the problem of big companies paying little to no taxes, which many Americans find unfair. The goal is to have these large corporations contribute more to the country's finances, which can be used for public services and infrastructure. However, not everyone thinks this is a good idea.

Kevin O'Leary, a business owner and TV personality, recently said raising the corporate tax rate to 28% would make the U.S. the least competitive country in the G7.

O’Leary explained, ""Tax rates matter. You heard Trump talk about 15 to 21 percent. Add three to four for each state, and you get into the range of 21 to 24, 25 for U.S. corporate tax. That’s sort of in the middle of the road regarding the competition. Not the best, but if you go to 28 and add four percent, you are the most uncompetitive country in the G7.""

This isn’t the first time O’Leary has criticized increasing corporate tax rates. A few years ago, he warned that such hikes would stifle economic growth by making it harder for U.S. companies to compete with businesses in other countries, which could slow down the economy and reduce job creation.

Trending: Warren Buffett once said, ""If you don't find a way to make money while you sleep, you will work until you die."" These high-yield real estate notes that pay 7.5% – 9% make earning passive income easier than ever.

On the other hand, the International Monetary Fund (IMF) has raised concerns about the impact of artificial intelligence on inequality, urging governments to protect their economies.

In a recent report, the IMF said it is really worried about big changes in the job market and more inequality as AI becomes more common. It thinks countries should improve unemployment benefits and prepare for job losses, especially in higher-skilled jobs, which is different from past technological changes.

Instead of imposing special taxes on AI, the IMF suggested raising taxes on capital gains, profits, and corporate income to address wealth inequality.

""We want people to be able to benefit more broadly from the potential that this technology holds, and we want to ensure that there are opportunities created for people,"" said Era Dabla-Norris, Deputy Director at the IMF’s Fiscal Affairs Department and co-author of the report, for the Financial Times.

Take Bill Ackman, whose strategy -- probably influenced by the great Warren Buffett -- focuses on making concentrated bets in high-quality businesses trading at compelling valuations.

Ackman's hedge fund firm, called Pershing Square Capital Management, currently manages $10.8 billion in assets. Rather than blindly following his portfolio decisions, investors should try to understand why he owns what he does.

One of Ackman's top holdings is tech titan Alphabet (NASDAQ: GOOGL) (NASDAQ: GOOG). Let's look at what factors may have drawn the hedge fund manager's attention to this dominant ""Magnificent Seven"" company.

Quality business

Pershing Square first purchased shares in Alphabet over a year ago during the first quarter of 2023. It might be surprising to see it quickly becoming a huge position. But Ackman went so far as to call this ""one of the world's greatest businesses."" That might be a bold statement, but I wouldn't disagree with his assessment.

Most readers are familiar with Google Search. With 91% share of the global search industry, this is undoubtedly Alphabet's bread-and-butter segment. Ackman calls out its powerful network effects and high barriers to entry.

Acquired by the business in 2006 for over $1.6 billion, YouTube also deserves some attention. Not only does it possess network effects as well, but it supports Alphabet's dominance in the digital ad industry. Ackman believes that the business is well-positioned to continue growing its sales over time due to the shift away from offline advertising to online methods.

Alphabet is poised to benefit from another secular trend, which is cloud computing. As IT spend transitions from on-site to off-premises, Google Cloud should continue its rise. This segment posted a 26% revenue gain in 2023, and it's now generating consistent operating income.

If you look through the Pershing Square portfolio, you'll realize that Ackman appreciates companies that are in a strong financial position. There are very few businesses in the world that can match Alphabet in this regard. As of March 31, it did carry $13.2 billion of long-term debt on the balance sheet. However, the company had $108.1 billion of cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities, virtually eliminating any financial risk.

AI leader

The artificial intelligence (AI) boom is drawing lots of attention from the investment community. After Chat GPT was first launched in late 2022, the market was worried that Alphabet was falling behind rivals when it came to developing this technology and introducing new features. But Ackman believes that this concern was overblown.

Story continues

Alphabet was using AI in Search as far back as 2001. And nearly all of its offerings, from YouTube and Maps to Gmail and Google Cloud, all utilize AI in some way. The fact that this business has such wide reach means that it can launch new AI features to almost instant adoption. Plus, Alphabet has the financial resources and technological know-how to be one of the leaders in AI going forward.

Is it too late to buy Alphabet stock?

With the benefit of hindsight, Ackman's purchase of Alphabet shares looked like an incredibly timely move. When his firm started buying the stock, it traded at a compelling forward price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio of just 16. This investment has worked out extremely well thus far, as shares are up 109% in the past 18 months.

Of course, the situation isn't as much of a no-brainer these days. As of this writing, Alphabet stock sells at a forward P/E multiple of 24.4. While not as good as the price Ackman paid, I still think this valuation makes shares a smart buy today.

The stock has soared more than 750% as of this writing, driven higher by the potential implications of generative artificial intelligence (AI). The ability to streamline time-consuming tasks and automate routine processes promises to increase productivity and could unleash a wave of greater profits for businesses that adopt this cutting-edge technology.

Nvidia's graphics processing units (GPUs) are the gold standard and provide the computational horsepower necessary for AI processing. This has let loose a tidal wave of demand for the company's high-end processors, sending its business and financial results surging, resulting in its recent 10-for-1 stock split.

While some investors fear the easy money has been made, others believe the best is yet to come. One analyst suggests Nvidia has a killer advantage that will help it stay ahead of the competition and unleash a ""cash gusher"" that will profit shareholders.

Let's see if the analyst's argument holds water and what it means for investors.

Nvidia's GB200 Grace Blackwell Superchip. Image source: Nvidia.

A long track record of success

To understand the source of this ""cash gusher,"" it helps to take a step back to see how Nvidia got to where it is today.

Nvidia's state-of-the-art processors have long been the industry standard for serious gamers. The company controlled 88% of the discrete desktop GPU market in the first quarter, according to data compiled by Jon Peddie Research.

However, Nvidia adapted that same technology to zip data through the ether, becoming the go-to processor for data centers. Estimates suggest the company controls as much as 92% of the data center GPU market, according to IoT Analytics. Nvidia is also the undisputed leader in processing machine learning -- an established branch of AI -- with an estimated 95% of that market, according to data supplied by New Street Research.

Since much of generative AI processing occurs in the cloud and data centers, Nvidia has cemented its position as the leader. The company is set to release its Blackwell family of processors later this year, and CEO Jensen Huang has said, ""The Blackwell Architecture platform will likely be the most successful product in our history."" If that's the case, and I believe that it is, the best could be yet to come.

Furthermore, while the popular narrative says the competition is coming for Nvidia, thus far -- despite years of opportunity -- no serious competitor has emerged.

A ""cash gusher""

Melius Research analyst Ben Reitzes believes Nvidia has one killer advantage that some investors may be overlooking, one that will keep the company on the leading edge of technology. Nvidia provides not only the chips that are tailor-made for AI but also the integrated software that eeks every last ounce of performance from these AI-centric processors. This ""full stack"" approach, or the marrying of hardware and software, provides Nvidia with a key advantage that will be hard for rivals to match, particularly given the company's long track record of leadership in the field.

Story continues

""What they did is they built a computing language and an ecosystem that allows you to monetize AI, and obviously, they're killing it,"" Reitzes said.

The analyst goes on to note that the cadence of Nvidia's research and development (R&D) makes it hard for competitors to keep up. The company recently increased its already relentless pace of innovation, as CEO Jensen Huang said the company is now ""on a one-year rhythm,"" releasing new processors every year instead of every two years. ""They're running 150 miles an hour while everyone else is running 100. It's going to be hard to catch these guys,"" Reitzes said.

As a result of the accelerating adoption of AI and Nvidia's dominant position, it's estimated the company will generate $270 billion in cash in the coming three years, which could unleash a wave of returns to shareholders in the form of stock buybacks and higher dividend payments.

The analyst notes that even with higher R&D spending, the influx of cash will far outweigh any potential uses, suggesting the majority will be returned to shareholders.

Investors are already seeing evidence of that shift. Late last year, Nvidia announced a new $25 billion share repurchase plan. Furthermore, in conjunction with its stock split announcement in May, the company increased its dividend payment by 150%. That said, Nvidia is currently using less than 1% of profits to fund the dividend, and even at its higher rate, the yield is a paltry 0.03%.

This illustrates that there's still ample opportunity for Nvidia to return cash to shareholders, and with the ongoing tsunami of AI adoption, the company will have an increasing amount of resources to do just that. Furthermore, given its killer advantage, its unlikely a rival will take Nvidia's crown, at least not anytime soon.

The stock has soared more than 750% as of this writing, driven higher by the potential implications of generative artificial intelligence (AI). The ability to streamline time-consuming tasks and automate routine processes promises to increase productivity and could unleash a wave of greater profits for businesses that adopt this cutting-edge technology.

Nvidia's graphics processing units (GPUs) are the gold standard and provide the computational horsepower necessary for AI processing. This has let loose a tidal wave of demand for the company's high-end processors, sending its business and financial results surging, resulting in its recent 10-for-1 stock split.

While some investors fear the easy money has been made, others believe the best is yet to come. One analyst suggests Nvidia has a killer advantage that will help it stay ahead of the competition and unleash a ""cash gusher"" that will profit shareholders.

Let's see if the analyst's argument holds water and what it means for investors.

A long track record of success

To understand the source of this ""cash gusher,"" it helps to take a step back to see how Nvidia got to where it is today.

Nvidia's state-of-the-art processors have long been the industry standard for serious gamers. The company controlled 88% of the discrete desktop GPU market in the first quarter, according to data compiled by Jon Peddie Research.

However, Nvidia adapted that same technology to zip data through the ether, becoming the go-to processor for data centers. Estimates suggest the company controls as much as 92% of the data center GPU market, according to IoT Analytics. Nvidia is also the undisputed leader in processing machine learning -- an established branch of AI -- with an estimated 95% of that market, according to data supplied by New Street Research.

Since much of generative AI processing occurs in the cloud and data centers, Nvidia has cemented its position as the leader. The company is set to release its Blackwell family of processors later this year, and CEO Jensen Huang has said, ""The Blackwell Architecture platform will likely be the most successful product in our history."" If that's the case, and I believe that it is, the best could be yet to come.

Furthermore, while the popular narrative says the competition is coming for Nvidia, thus far -- despite years of opportunity -- no serious competitor has emerged.

A ""cash gusher""

Melius Research analyst Ben Reitzes believes Nvidia has one killer advantage that some investors may be overlooking, one that will keep the company on the leading edge of technology. Nvidia provides not only the chips that are tailor-made for AI but also the integrated software that eeks every last ounce of performance from these AI-centric processors. This ""full stack"" approach, or the marrying of hardware and software, provides Nvidia with a key advantage that will be hard for rivals to match, particularly given the company's long track record of leadership in the field.

Story continues

""What they did is they built a computing language and an ecosystem that allows you to monetize AI, and obviously, they're killing it,"" Reitzes said.

The analyst goes on to note that the cadence of Nvidia's research and development (R&D) makes it hard for competitors to keep up. The company recently increased its already relentless pace of innovation, as CEO Jensen Huang said the company is now ""on a one-year rhythm,"" releasing new processors every year instead of every two years. ""They're running 150 miles an hour while everyone else is running 100. It's going to be hard to catch these guys,"" Reitzes said.

As a result of the accelerating adoption of AI and Nvidia's dominant position, it's estimated the company will generate $270 billion in cash in the coming three years, which could unleash a wave of returns to shareholders in the form of stock buybacks and higher dividend payments.

The analyst notes that even with higher R&D spending, the influx of cash will far outweigh any potential uses, suggesting the majority will be returned to shareholders.

Investors are already seeing evidence of that shift. Late last year, Nvidia announced a new $25 billion share repurchase plan. Furthermore, in conjunction with its stock split announcement in May, the company increased its dividend payment by 150%. That said, Nvidia is currently using less than 1% of profits to fund the dividend, and even at its higher rate, the yield is a paltry 0.03%.

This illustrates that there's still ample opportunity for Nvidia to return cash to shareholders, and with the ongoing tsunami of AI adoption, the company will have an increasing amount of resources to do just that. Furthermore, given its killer advantage, its unlikely a rival will take Nvidia's crown, at least not anytime soon.

The S&P 500 (^GSPC) added more than 0.6% to close at 5,509, marking the index's first-ever close above 5,500. The tech-filled Nasdaq Composite (^IXIC) also notched a record close as it gained more than 0.8% to close at 18,028. Meanwhile, the Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI) rose about 0.4%.

The market came off its lows just after 10 a.m. ET, when fresh data on job openings showed the labor market remains resilient despite concerns over recent softer data.

New data from the Bureau of Labor Statistics released Tuesday showed there were 8.14 million jobs open at the end of May, an unexpected increase from the 7.92 million job openings in April.

For his part, Powell said he is encouraged by cooler inflation but reinforced that the central bank will need to see more evidence before cutting interest rates. He noted the latest inflation readings from April and May ""do suggest that we are getting back on a disinflationary path.""

The 10-year Treasury yield (^TNX) nudged lower to 4.43% on Tuesday after one of its largest single-day gains of the year on Monday. On the corporate front, Tesla (TSLA) delivered more vehicles than expected in the second quarter, sending shares up about 10%.

Why home prices are still soaring despite rising supply Home prices have continued to hit new records despite rising inventory this year. Goldman Sachs analysts laid out three reasons why in a research note this week. First, the new housing inventory is ""heavily skewed toward homes under construction,"" Goldman Sachs analyst Vinay Viswanathan explains. But the reason for the backlog isn't overbuilding. It's that homes are taking longer to complete as a result of a shortage of construction workers and supply chain disruptions for building products and appliances. Second, construction activity has been mainly in metropolitan areas that have fewer land regulations, while areas with strict zoning are facing housing shortages. So new supply isn't really alleviating housing needs. Third, rising new home supply has helped balance a lack of inventory in the resale market. This side of the market has been impacted by the so-called “lock-in” effect of homeowners securing ultracheap mortgages when rates were lower during the pandemic, which has caused owners to stay put. “With strong demographic tailwinds for housing demand, we think housing supply is still imbalanced vs. demand, underpinning our economists’ forecast for the US homeowner vacancy rate to rise only gradually from 0.8% today to 1.1% by year-end 2024 (below the 2019 average of 1.4%),"" the note said.

Powell: The labor market is 'not steeply' cooling off In recent weeks, we've highlighted commentary from several economists pointing out that recent cooling in the labor market could be the start of a more concerning trend. In a speech on June 24, San Francisco Fed president Mary Daly also opined on the topic, noting that the labor market is moving toward a point where a ""benign"" slowing outcome could be less likely. Daly highlighted that further declines in job openings would likely come with an increase in the unemployment rate. But recent data from the Job Openings and Labor Turnover Survey (JOLTS), didn't fuel those concerns. New data from the Bureau of Labor Statistics released Tuesday showed the job openings rate ticked higher to 4.9% from 4.8% the month prior. There were 8.14 million jobs open at the end of May, an increase from the 7.92 million job openings in April. Economists surveyed by Bloomberg had expected the report to show 7.95 million openings in May. Around the time the survey was released Fed Chair Jerome Powell spoke about labor market conditions during a panel in Portugal for a European Central Bank conference. Powell implied that any further softening in labor demand could be met with higher unemployment but added that if the unemployment rate merely moved “plus or minus a couple of tenths” from its current 4% rate, that would be a ""good outcome.” Powell added that the labor market isn't cooling too quickly, suddenly, or steeply. Instead, it's been “kind of what we were hoping to see, and what we have been seeing,"" Powell said.

Q2 earnings season comes with a 'high bar' Wall Street has high hopes for the upcoming earnings season, which will kick off in earnest with reports from big banks on July 12. Consensus expects earnings to grow 9% from the year prior during the second quarter, which would mark the largest year-over-year gain since the fourth quarter of 2021. Given that expectations have been trimmed less than normal entering earnings season, Wall Street strategists have noted both earnings beats and stock pops following releases could be less frequent than normal. ""We expect the magnitude of EPS beats to diminish as consensus forecasts set a higher bar than in previous quarters,"" Goldman Sachs chief US equity strategist David Kostin wrote in a note previewing earnings season. With the market trading near record levels entering earnings season, Kostin and other strategists are cautious about how much upside investors should expect following earnings that top Wall Street analysts' expectations. Kostin notes that last quarter, companies that beat expectations outperformed the S&P 500 by 3 basis points in the following day of trading, well below the historical average of 100 basis points. Given investor sentiment is still elevated entering this round of earnings, Kostin reasons, ""the reward for beats should be smaller than average this quarter, although not as extreme as during the 1Q season."" Deutsche Bank chief equity strategist Binky Chadha detailed a similar outcome in his research note previewing second quarter reports. Chadha's work shows that the S&P 500 rises 80% of the time during earnings season with an average return of 2%. But Chadha noted, ""On the other hand, the market run up into earnings season and overweight equity positioning argue for a muted rally.""

Oil prices rise amid Hurricane Beryl concerns, Middle East tensions Oil prices have been picking up as a Category 5 hurricane looms amid what some fear could be a ""very active"" hurricane season. Yahoo Finance's Ines Ferre reports: Oil prices remained near a two-month high on Tuesday as the first Category 5 hurricane of the season threatened to disrupt the markets and tensions in the Middle East showed no signs of abating. West Texas Intermediate (CL=F) topped $83 per barrel while Brent (BZ=F) hovered above $86 per barrel in midday trading. Traders are keeping a close eye on Hurricane Beryl in the Caribbean, the earliest Category 5 storm on record. “The weather agencies are suggesting that this is going to be a very active hurricane season,"" TD Cowen managing director Jason Gabelman told Yahoo Finance on Tuesday. ""If [hurricanes] hit the Gulf Coast, it could disrupt that center of US refining capacity, which is about 50% of total capacity in the US,"" he said. Analysts are keeping an eye out for Mexico's oil output. The country is responsible for about 5% of global production. Hurricane Beryl is expected to threaten Jamaica on Wednesday and continue toward Mexico's Yucatan Peninsula this week. ""Gulf Coast refineries import about 400,000 barrels per day of crude oil from Mexico, representing 25% of the crude oil that is imported into the Gulf Coast. Damage to the oil production facilities as well as to the export locations is a possibility,"" wrote Andy Lipow, president of Lipow Oil Associates, in a note on Tuesday.

RBC Capital Markets raises S&P 500 year-end target to 5,700 More strategists are calling for a rise in the S&P 500 (^GSPC) during the second half of 2024. RBC Capital Markets head of US equity strategy Lori Calvasina raised her year-end target to 5,700 from 5,300 on Tuesday. ""The story we see in our data for 2024 is that the stock market has gotten a bit ahead of itself from a valuation perspective, as well as on some of our sentiment work,"" Calvasina wrote. ""But that some of our tools (including one of our sentiment models) do still point to the potential for the S&P 500 to move a little bit higher between now and year-end."" RBC's upgrade came with a boost to their earnings outlook which now sees $242 in earnings per share for the S&P 500, up from $237. The team also now sees margins expanding in both 2024 and 2025, as opposed to prior forecast of flat margins in 2024. Still, Calvasina calls herself a “nervous and jumpy bull,"" noting economic certainty remains a key risk to her market call. ""We are mindful that there is a lot of fog in the 2H24-2025 outlook (specifically regarding the US consumer and election), that the US economy appears to be entering a soft patch, and that stock market volatility often picks up to some extent in Presidential election years,"" Calvasina wrote. ""We assume any pullback will end up being a pothole on the path to recovery (off conditions that were close to a recession in 2022) that will get back on track before too long. ""But if we are wrong and the economic forecast takes a turn for the worse in the months ahead, or looks like it’s poised to do so in 2025, there is downside risk to our year-end 2024 call.""

Powell: 'We are getting back on a disinflationary path' Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell spoke publicly on Tuesday for the first time since the Fed's preferred inflation gauge showed prices increased at their slowest pace in more than three years during the month of May. While still showing signs of caution, Powell admitted the data has been in the right direction recently. Yahoo Finance's Jennifer Schonberger reports: Powell said Tuesday that he is encouraged by cooler inflation but reinforced that the central bank will need to see more evidence before cutting interest rates. The last two inflation readings in April and May ""do suggest that we are getting back on a disinflationary path,” Powell said speaking on a panel in Portugal for a European Central Bank conference. Powell’s comments come days after the latest reading of the Fed’s preferred inflation target — the ""core"" Personal Consumption Expenditures (PCE) index — rose 2.6% in May, in line with expectations and down from 2.8% in April. On a month-over-month basis, the inflation measure rose 0.1%, also in line with expectations and down from 0.2% in April. The reading offered new support for rate cuts later this year, easing concerns that mounted during the first quarter that hotter-than-expected inflation could upend plans for a loosening of monetary policy in 2024. Despite another positive signal that inflation is easing, the central bank isn't likely to cut rates at its next meeting in late July. Powell declined to answer a question about whether the Fed could cut as soon as September. Instead, he underscored the Fed will need more time and evidence that inflation is moving sustainably down to its 2% target, noting that the central bank can afford to be patient given a strong job market that is cooling gradually. ""We've made a lot of progress,"" said Powell. ""We just want to understand that the levels that we're seeing are a true reading on what is actually happening with underlying inflation.""

Job openings unexpectedly increase in May Job openings picked up in May, surprising Wall Street which had been watching for further signs of cooling in the labor market New data from the Bureau of Labor Statistics released Tuesday showed there were 8.14 million jobs open at the end of May, an increase from the 7.92 million job openings in April. March's figure was revised lower from the 8.06 million open jobs initially reported. Economists surveyed by Bloomberg had expected the report to show 7.95 million openings in May. The Job Openings and Labor Turnover Survey (JOLTS) also showed 5.8 million hires were made during the month, a slight uptick from April. The hiring rate held at 3.6%, unchanged from April. Also in Tuesday's report, the quits rate, a sign of confidence among workers, held steady at 2.2%.

Tesla shares rise after deliveries beat Tesla stock (TSLA) jumped roughly 5% in early trading Tuesday after the electric vehicle maker reported quarterly vehicle deliveries that beat Wall Street expectations. The EV giant delivered 443,956 vehicles during the second quarter, versus an analyst consensus estimate of 439,302 deliveries, per Bloomberg data. “In the second quarter, we produced approximately 411,000 vehicles and delivered approximately 444,000 vehicles,” read a company statement. Broken down by car type, Tesla said it delivered 422,405 models 3/Y, and 21,551 other models. That second quarter total delivery figure is higher than the 386,810 vehicles globally delivered in the first quarter but lower than the approximate 466,140 delivered a year ago.

Stocks slip at the open US stocks retreated on Tuesday as investors cautiously weighed rate-cut odds ahead of crucial jobs data and eyed what higher chances of a Donald Trump win could mean for markets.

Meanwhile, political risk is preying on minds as Wall Street assesses what a Trump election win could mean for markets as speculation grows about Biden's future as the Democratic Party's standard bearer. The 10-year Treasury yield (^TNX) nudged lower to 4.43% on Tuesday after one of its largest single-day gains of the year on Monday.

Yahoo Finance,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/stock-market-today-sp-500-nasdaq-close-at-record-highs-as-powell-touts-inflation-progress-184217556.html,2024-07-02,18:42:17 UTC,"Stock market today: S&P 500, Nasdaq close at record highs as Powell touts inflation progress","US stocks rallied on Tuesday as investors digested fresh commentary from Federal Reserve chair Jerome Powell, who cheered the ""disinflationary path"" of recent economic data.

The S&P 500 (^GSPC) added more than 0.6% to close at 5,509, marking the index's first-ever close above 5,500. The tech-filled Nasdaq Composite (^IXIC) also notched a record close as it gained more than 0.8% to close at 18,028. Meanwhile, the Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI) rose about 0.4%.

The market came off its lows just after 10 a.m. ET, when fresh data on job openings showed the labor market remains resilient despite concerns over recent softer data.

New data from the Bureau of Labor Statistics released Tuesday showed there were 8.14 million jobs open at the end of May, an unexpected increase from the 7.92 million job openings in April.

For his part, Powell said he is encouraged by cooler inflation but reinforced that the central bank will need to see more evidence before cutting interest rates. He noted the latest inflation readings from April and May ""do suggest that we are getting back on a disinflationary path.""

The 10-year Treasury yield (^TNX) nudged lower to 4.43% on Tuesday after one of its largest single-day gains of the year on Monday. On the corporate front, Tesla (TSLA) delivered more vehicles than expected in the second quarter, sending shares up about 10%.

Live 12 updates Nasdaq Composite crosses 18,000 for first time ever, S&P 500 breaks 5,500 US stocks rallied on Tuesday as investors digested fresh commentary from Federal Reserve chair Jerome Powell, who cheered the ""disinflationary path"" of recent economic data. The S&P 500 (^GSPC) added more than 0.6% to close at 5,509, marking the index's first-ever close above 5,500. The tech-filled Nasdaq Composite (^IXIC) also notched a record close as it gained roughly 0.8% to close at 18,028. Meanwhile, the Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI) rose just more than 0.4%. The move was largely driven by a rally in megacap tech. A 10% surge in Tesla (TSLA) after better than expected second quarter deliveries helped push the indexes to new highs, while Amazon (AMZN), Apple (AAPL) and Alphabet (GOOGL, GOOG) were all also up more than 1%.

Why home prices are still soaring despite rising supply Home prices have continued to hit new records despite rising inventory this year. Goldman Sachs analysts laid out three reasons why in a research note this week. First, the new housing inventory is ""heavily skewed toward homes under construction,"" Goldman Sachs analyst Vinay Viswanathan explains. But the reason for the backlog isn't overbuilding. It's that homes are taking longer to complete as a result of a shortage of construction workers and supply chain disruptions for building products and appliances. Second, construction activity has been mainly in metropolitan areas that have fewer land regulations, while areas with strict zoning are facing housing shortages. So new supply isn't really alleviating housing needs. Third, rising new home supply has helped balance a lack of inventory in the resale market. This side of the market has been impacted by the so-called “lock-in” effect of homeowners securing ultracheap mortgages when rates were lower during the pandemic, which has caused owners to stay put. “With strong demographic tailwinds for housing demand, we think housing supply is still imbalanced vs. demand, underpinning our economists’ forecast for the US homeowner vacancy rate to rise only gradually from 0.8% today to 1.1% by year-end 2024 (below the 2019 average of 1.4%),"" the note said.

Powell: The labor market is 'not steeply' cooling off In recent weeks, we've highlighted commentary from several economists pointing out that recent cooling in the labor market could be the start of a more concerning trend. In a speech on June 24, San Francisco Fed president Mary Daly also opined on the topic, noting that the labor market is moving toward a point where a ""benign"" slowing outcome could be less likely. Daly highlighted that further declines in job openings would likely come with an increase in the unemployment rate. But recent data from the Job Openings and Labor Turnover Survey (JOLTS), didn't fuel those concerns. New data from the Bureau of Labor Statistics released Tuesday showed the job openings rate ticked higher to 4.9% from 4.8% the month prior. There were 8.14 million jobs open at the end of May, an increase from the 7.92 million job openings in April. Economists surveyed by Bloomberg had expected the report to show 7.95 million openings in May. Around the time the survey was released Fed Chair Jerome Powell spoke about labor market conditions during a panel in Portugal for a European Central Bank conference. Powell implied that any further softening in labor demand could be met with higher unemployment but added that if the unemployment rate merely moved “plus or minus a couple of tenths” from its current 4% rate, that would be a ""good outcome.” Powell added that the labor market isn't cooling too quickly, suddenly, or steeply. Instead, it's been “kind of what we were hoping to see, and what we have been seeing,"" Powell said.

Q2 earnings season comes with a 'high bar' Wall Street has high hopes for the upcoming earnings season, which will kick off in earnest with reports from big banks on July 12. Consensus expects earnings to grow 9% from the year prior during the second quarter, which would mark the largest year-over-year gain since the fourth quarter of 2021. Given that expectations have been trimmed less than normal entering earnings season, Wall Street strategists have noted both earnings beats and stock pops following releases could be less frequent than normal. ""We expect the magnitude of EPS beats to diminish as consensus forecasts set a higher bar than in previous quarters,"" Goldman Sachs chief US equity strategist David Kostin wrote in a note previewing earnings season. With the market trading near record levels entering earnings season, Kostin and other strategists are cautious about how much upside investors should expect following earnings that top Wall Street analysts' expectations. Kostin notes that last quarter, companies that beat expectations outperformed the S&P 500 by 3 basis points in the following day of trading, well below the historical average of 100 basis points. Given investor sentiment is still elevated entering this round of earnings, Kostin reasons, ""the reward for beats should be smaller than average this quarter, although not as extreme as during the 1Q season."" Deutsche Bank chief equity strategist Binky Chadha detailed a similar outcome in his research note previewing second quarter reports. Chadha's work shows that the S&P 500 rises 80% of the time during earnings season with an average return of 2%. But Chadha noted, ""On the other hand, the market run up into earnings season and overweight equity positioning argue for a muted rally.""

Oil prices rise amid Hurricane Beryl concerns, Middle East tensions Oil prices have been picking up as a Category 5 hurricane looms amid what some fear could be a ""very active"" hurricane season. Yahoo Finance's Ines Ferre reports: Oil prices remained near a two-month high on Tuesday as the first Category 5 hurricane of the season threatened to disrupt the markets and tensions in the Middle East showed no signs of abating. West Texas Intermediate (CL=F) topped $83 per barrel while Brent (BZ=F) hovered above $86 per barrel in midday trading. Traders are keeping a close eye on Hurricane Beryl in the Caribbean, the earliest Category 5 storm on record. “The weather agencies are suggesting that this is going to be a very active hurricane season,"" TD Cowen managing director Jason Gabelman told Yahoo Finance on Tuesday. ""If [hurricanes] hit the Gulf Coast, it could disrupt that center of US refining capacity, which is about 50% of total capacity in the US,"" he said. Analysts are keeping an eye out for Mexico's oil output. The country is responsible for about 5% of global production. Hurricane Beryl is expected to threaten Jamaica on Wednesday and continue toward Mexico's Yucatan Peninsula this week. ""Gulf Coast refineries import about 400,000 barrels per day of crude oil from Mexico, representing 25% of the crude oil that is imported into the Gulf Coast. Damage to the oil production facilities as well as to the export locations is a possibility,"" wrote Andy Lipow, president of Lipow Oil Associates, in a note on Tuesday.

Tesla leads Consumer Discretionary, Nasdaq higher Consumer Discretionary (XLY) led the gains in the S&P 500 (^GSPC) on Tuesday as Tesla surged roughly 9%. Meanwhile, Health Care (XLV) was the biggest laggard, falling about 0.7%. Across the board, the major indexes were rather quiet on Wednesday. The Nasdaq Composite (^IXIC) led the gains, rising more than 0.2% and approaching a close at 18,000 for the first time ever. Source: Yahoo Finance

RBC Capital Markets raises S&P 500 year-end target to 5,700 More strategists are calling for a rise in the S&P 500 (^GSPC) during the second half of 2024. RBC Capital Markets head of US equity strategy Lori Calvasina raised her year-end target to 5,700 from 5,300 on Tuesday. ""The story we see in our data for 2024 is that the stock market has gotten a bit ahead of itself from a valuation perspective, as well as on some of our sentiment work,"" Calvasina wrote. ""But that some of our tools (including one of our sentiment models) do still point to the potential for the S&P 500 to move a little bit higher between now and year-end."" RBC's upgrade came with a boost to their earnings outlook which now sees $242 in earnings per share for the S&P 500, up from $237. The team also now sees margins expanding in both 2024 and 2025, as opposed to prior forecast of flat margins in 2024. Still, Calvasina calls herself a “nervous and jumpy bull,"" noting economic certainty remains a key risk to her market call. ""We are mindful that there is a lot of fog in the 2H24-2025 outlook (specifically regarding the US consumer and election), that the US economy appears to be entering a soft patch, and that stock market volatility often picks up to some extent in Presidential election years,"" Calvasina wrote. ""We assume any pullback will end up being a pothole on the path to recovery (off conditions that were close to a recession in 2022) that will get back on track before too long. ""But if we are wrong and the economic forecast takes a turn for the worse in the months ahead, or looks like it’s poised to do so in 2025, there is downside risk to our year-end 2024 call.""

Powell: 'We are getting back on a disinflationary path' Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell spoke publicly on Tuesday for the first time since the Fed's preferred inflation gauge showed prices increased at their slowest pace in more than three years during the month of May. While still showing signs of caution, Powell admitted the data has been in the right direction recently. Yahoo Finance's Jennifer Schonberger reports: Powell said Tuesday that he is encouraged by cooler inflation but reinforced that the central bank will need to see more evidence before cutting interest rates. The last two inflation readings in April and May ""do suggest that we are getting back on a disinflationary path,” Powell said speaking on a panel in Portugal for a European Central Bank conference. Powell’s comments come days after the latest reading of the Fed’s preferred inflation target — the ""core"" Personal Consumption Expenditures (PCE) index — rose 2.6% in May, in line with expectations and down from 2.8% in April. On a month-over-month basis, the inflation measure rose 0.1%, also in line with expectations and down from 0.2% in April. The reading offered new support for rate cuts later this year, easing concerns that mounted during the first quarter that hotter-than-expected inflation could upend plans for a loosening of monetary policy in 2024. Despite another positive signal that inflation is easing, the central bank isn't likely to cut rates at its next meeting in late July. Powell declined to answer a question about whether the Fed could cut as soon as September. Instead, he underscored the Fed will need more time and evidence that inflation is moving sustainably down to its 2% target, noting that the central bank can afford to be patient given a strong job market that is cooling gradually. ""We've made a lot of progress,"" said Powell. ""We just want to understand that the levels that we're seeing are a true reading on what is actually happening with underlying inflation.""

Job openings unexpectedly increase in May Job openings picked up in May, surprising Wall Street which had been watching for further signs of cooling in the labor market New data from the Bureau of Labor Statistics released Tuesday showed there were 8.14 million jobs open at the end of May, an increase from the 7.92 million job openings in April. March's figure was revised lower from the 8.06 million open jobs initially reported. Economists surveyed by Bloomberg had expected the report to show 7.95 million openings in May. The Job Openings and Labor Turnover Survey (JOLTS) also showed 5.8 million hires were made during the month, a slight uptick from April. The hiring rate held at 3.6%, unchanged from April. Also in Tuesday's report, the quits rate, a sign of confidence among workers, held steady at 2.2%.

Tesla shares rise after deliveries beat Tesla stock (TSLA) jumped roughly 5% in early trading Tuesday after the electric vehicle maker reported quarterly vehicle deliveries that beat Wall Street expectations. The EV giant delivered 443,956 vehicles during the second quarter, versus an analyst consensus estimate of 439,302 deliveries, per Bloomberg data. “In the second quarter, we produced approximately 411,000 vehicles and delivered approximately 444,000 vehicles,” read a company statement. Broken down by car type, Tesla said it delivered 422,405 models 3/Y, and 21,551 other models. That second quarter total delivery figure is higher than the 386,810 vehicles globally delivered in the first quarter but lower than the approximate 466,140 delivered a year ago.

Stocks slip at the open US stocks retreated on Tuesday as investors cautiously weighed rate-cut odds ahead of crucial jobs data and eyed what higher chances of a Donald Trump win could mean for markets. The Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI) slipped 0.1% while the S&P 500 (^GSPC) nearly 0.2%. The tech-filled Nasdaq Composite (^IXIC) slid more than 0.2%. Meanwhile, political risk is preying on minds as Wall Street assesses what a Trump election win could mean for markets as speculation grows about Biden's future as the Democratic Party's standard bearer. The 10-year Treasury yield (^TNX) nudged lower to 4.43% on Tuesday after one of its largest single-day gains of the year on Monday.

Roaring Kitty's likely investment thesis on Chewy... Talk about a well-timed note from Evercore ISI tech analyst Mark Mahaney. Mahaney nicely breaks down the investment thesis in Chewy (CHWY) the day after Keith 'Roaring Kitty' Gill disclosed a 6.6% stake in the company. He also shared some helpful survey analysis below. Mahaney wrote: ""We continue to view Chewy as a solid business that is impacted by broader industry weakness, but still holds many investment positives – consistently rising spend/loyalty per Chewy customer, budding growth opportunities in sponsored ads, international expansion, and vertical expansion (e.g. vet care clinics), and the potential for ongoing gross and EBITDA margin expansion."" Mahaney is sticking with an in-line rating for now, citing competitive pressures, valuation, and an unproven push into Canada. Chewy is a top-of-mind destination for pet products, according to a new survey from Evercore ISI. (EvercoreISI)","The S&P 500 (^GSPC) added more than 0.6% to close at 5,509, marking the index's first-ever close above 5,500.

Yahoo Finance,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/youd-invested-1-000-microsoft-154308294.html,2024-07-02,15:43:08 UTC,"If You'd Invested $1,000 in Microsoft Stock 10 Years Ago, Here's How Much You'd Have Today","Microsoft (NASDAQ: MSFT) is one of the world's largest and most influential tech companies. It's also the most valuable public company in the world at the moment at $3.4 trillion. In addition to providing cloud-computing services, market-leading operating systems, and productivity software, the technology giant is also at the forefront of the artificial intelligence (AI) revolution.

Strong earnings results and emerging opportunities in AI have helped power strong performance for the company's stock lately. The software giant's share price is up 34% over the last year alone.

Even more impressive, the stock has delivered a return of more than 1,160% since Satya Nadella became the company's CEO in February 2014. That means that if you invested $1,000 on the day Nadella took over on Feb. 4, 2014, your investment would now be worth more than $12,570.

Nadella has worked wonders at Microsoft

With Microsoft on a winning streak, it might be easy to forget that the company was facing some major challenges at the time Nadella took over in the CEO role. Due to some failed projects and unproductive strategic directions, the company and its stock had a rocky start to the 2010s. But Microsoft managed to deliver an incredible turnaround.

Nadella spearheaded a pivot to a new strategy that focused on subscription services. The company shifted Office and other software away from being one-time licensing purchases and instead started selling them on a subscription basis. This made the company's sales more dependable and also helped boost margins.

He also oversaw the strategic prioritization and growth of the company's Azure cloud infrastructure services. Azure has grown at an incredible rate over the last decade, and it currently stands as the second-largest player by market share -- trailing behind only Amazon's AWS.

Microsoft's cloud business is generating strong sales, growing rapidly, and posting impressive profit margins. It's also helped the company tap into emerging AI-driven demand, and the best is likely still to come.

Yahoo Finance,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/2-stock-split-ai-stocks-084400291.html,2024-07-01,08:44:00 UTC,"2 Stock-Split AI Stocks to Buy Before They Soar 70% and 230%, According to Certain Wall Street Analysts","Semiconductor company Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA) completed a 10-for-1 stock split in June, and fellow chipmaker Broadcom (NASDAQ: AVGO) has a 10-for-1 stock split planned for July. Savvy investors have gravitated toward both stocks. A company's share price tends to increase about twice as fast as the S&P 500 (SNPINDEX: ^GSPC) during the year following a stock split announcement.

Indeed, certain Wall Street analysts see substantial upside in Nvidia and Broadcom.

Beth Kendig at the I/O Fund expects Nvidia to achieve a $10 trillion market capitalization by 2030. That forecast implies about 230% upside from its current market capitalization of $3 trillion.

Joseph Moore at Morgan Stanley has outlined a bull-case price target that values Broadcom at $2,292 per share by June 2025. That will change to $229.20 per share after the stock split. Either way, that forecast implies 70% upside from its current price of $1,605 per share.

Here's what investors should know about Nvidia and Broadcom.

Nvidia: The market leading in data center GPUs and AI chips

Nvidia graphics processing units (GPUs) are the gold standard in rendering realistic computer graphics and accelerating complex data center workloads like artificial intelligence (AI) applications. Nvidia also provides adjacent data center hardware, such as central processing units (CPUs) and networking equipment, as well as subscription software and services that support graphics and AI workflows.

Nvidia holds more than 95% market share in workstation graphics processors and more than 90% market share in data center GPUs. Additionally, regarding AI specifically, The Wall Street Journal recently reported that ""Nvidia's chips underpin all of the most advanced AI systems, giving the company a market share estimated at more than 80%."" Looking ahead, Nvidia is unlikely to lose its leadership position anytime soon because it has a durable competitive advantage in CUDA.

Nvidia CUDA is a programming model lets GPUs (originally designed for graphics applications) accelerate all sorts of data center computing tasks. The CUDA ecosystem comprises hundreds of software libraries (building blocks) that streamline model training and application development. No other chipmaker has a comparable ecosystem of supporting software. In other words, competitors not only need to overcome the superior performance of Nvidia hardware, but also the immense convenience afforded to developers by Nvidia software.

Nvidia reported blockbuster financial results in the first quarter. Revenue increased 262% to $26 billion and non-GAAP net income soared 461% to $6.12 per diluted share. Nvidia is set to maintain that momentum as the AI market grows. In fact, CFRA analyst Angelo Zino recently said Nvidia ""will be the most important company to our civilization over the next decade.""

Story continues

Additionally, rapid innovation should keep the company ahead of its peers. Nvidia Blackwell GPUs offer four times faster AI training and 30 times faster AI inferencing as compared to the previous Hopper generation. Rosenblatt analyst Han Mosesmann recently said, ""The new Blackwell GPU platform, which ramps up later in 2024, is likely the most ambitious project Silicon Valley has ever witnessed.""

Wall Street expects Nvidia to grow earnings per share at 33% annually over the next three to five years. That makes its current valuation of 68 times adjusted earnings look a little expensive, but not unreasonably so. Investors should be prepared to pay a premium if they want to own this stock.

Personally, I am skeptical about Nvidia achieving a $10 trillion market capitalization by 2030. I certainly believe it's possible, but many things would have to go right for the company. That said, I do believe Nvidia will beat the S&P 500 over the next three to five years, so patient investors should consider buying a small position today.

Broadcom: The market leader in ASICs and networking chips

Broadcom breaks its business into semiconductor solutions and infrastructure software. The company earns semiconductor solutions revenue by developing chips for wired and wireless networking, data center storage, and other end markets. Broadcom also develops application specific integrated circuits (ASICs), chips purpose-built for specialized use cases like artificial intelligence. Additionally, Broadcom earns infrastructure software revenue from cybersecurity, monitoring, and virtualization products.

Broadcom is the leading provider of ASICs with 35% market share, while its closest competitor Marvell Technology holds 12% market share. It is also the leader in networking and wireless chips. That puts Broadcom in a good position because AI adoption is driving demand for ASICs and networking chips. Analysts at Goldman Sachs recently wrote, ""Alongside Nvidia, we view Broadcom as a critical piece to the ongoing AI infrastructure build-out.""

Broadcom reported solid financial results in the second quarter, beating estimates on the top and bottom lines. Revenue surged 43% to $12.5 billion on particularly strong demand for AI chips and virtualization software. Meanwhile, GAAP net income declined 46% to $4.42 per diluted share, but that was due to costs associated with its 2023 acquisition of VMware. Non-GAAP operating income increased 32% during the second quarter.

Broadcom is a hidden gem among AI stocks because Nvidia casts a long shadow. But its strong position in ASICs and networking chips should be a source of momentous revenue growth in the coming years. Indeed, management expects AI chips to account for 25% of its semiconductor solutions revenue in 2025, up from 15% in 2023.

However, Wall Street expects the company to grow earnings per share at 17% annually over the next three to five years. That makes its current valuation of 69 times earnings look expensive, especially when the three-year average is 32 times earnings. To be fair, earnings may grow more quickly than anticipated depending on how the VMware integration progresses. But I plan to avoid the stock until the valuation appears more reasonable. To that end, I see little chance of an 70% return over the next 12 months.

Yahoo Finance,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/2-stock-split-ai-stocks-084400291.html,2024-07-01,08:44:00 UTC,"2 Stock-Split AI Stocks to Buy Before They Soar 70% and 230%, According to Certain Wall Street Analysts","Semiconductor company Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA) completed a 10-for-1 stock split in June, and fellow chipmaker Broadcom (NASDAQ: AVGO) has a 10-for-1 stock split planned for July. Savvy investors have gravitated toward both stocks. A company's share price tends to increase about twice as fast as the S&P 500 (SNPINDEX: ^GSPC) during the year following a stock split announcement.

Indeed, certain Wall Street analysts see substantial upside in Nvidia and Broadcom.

Beth Kendig at the I/O Fund expects Nvidia to achieve a $10 trillion market capitalization by 2030. That forecast implies about 230% upside from its current market capitalization of $3 trillion.

Joseph Moore at Morgan Stanley has outlined a bull-case price target that values Broadcom at $2,292 per share by June 2025. That will change to $229.20 per share after the stock split. Either way, that forecast implies 70% upside from its current price of $1,605 per share.

Here's what investors should know about Nvidia and Broadcom.

Nvidia: The market leading in data center GPUs and AI chips

Nvidia graphics processing units (GPUs) are the gold standard in rendering realistic computer graphics and accelerating complex data center workloads like artificial intelligence (AI) applications. Nvidia also provides adjacent data center hardware, such as central processing units (CPUs) and networking equipment, as well as subscription software and services that support graphics and AI workflows.

Nvidia holds more than 95% market share in workstation graphics processors and more than 90% market share in data center GPUs. Additionally, regarding AI specifically, The Wall Street Journal recently reported that ""Nvidia's chips underpin all of the most advanced AI systems, giving the company a market share estimated at more than 80%."" Looking ahead, Nvidia is unlikely to lose its leadership position anytime soon because it has a durable competitive advantage in CUDA.

Nvidia CUDA is a programming model lets GPUs (originally designed for graphics applications) accelerate all sorts of data center computing tasks. The CUDA ecosystem comprises hundreds of software libraries (building blocks) that streamline model training and application development. No other chipmaker has a comparable ecosystem of supporting software. In other words, competitors not only need to overcome the superior performance of Nvidia hardware, but also the immense convenience afforded to developers by Nvidia software.

Nvidia reported blockbuster financial results in the first quarter. Revenue increased 262% to $26 billion and non-GAAP net income soared 461% to $6.12 per diluted share. Nvidia is set to maintain that momentum as the AI market grows. In fact, CFRA analyst Angelo Zino recently said Nvidia ""will be the most important company to our civilization over the next decade.""

Story continues

Additionally, rapid innovation should keep the company ahead of its peers. Nvidia Blackwell GPUs offer four times faster AI training and 30 times faster AI inferencing as compared to the previous Hopper generation. Rosenblatt analyst Han Mosesmann recently said, ""The new Blackwell GPU platform, which ramps up later in 2024, is likely the most ambitious project Silicon Valley has ever witnessed.""

Wall Street expects Nvidia to grow earnings per share at 33% annually over the next three to five years. That makes its current valuation of 68 times adjusted earnings look a little expensive, but not unreasonably so. Investors should be prepared to pay a premium if they want to own this stock.

Personally, I am skeptical about Nvidia achieving a $10 trillion market capitalization by 2030. I certainly believe it's possible, but many things would have to go right for the company. That said, I do believe Nvidia will beat the S&P 500 over the next three to five years, so patient investors should consider buying a small position today.

Broadcom: The market leader in ASICs and networking chips

Broadcom breaks its business into semiconductor solutions and infrastructure software. The company earns semiconductor solutions revenue by developing chips for wired and wireless networking, data center storage, and other end markets. Broadcom also develops application specific integrated circuits (ASICs), chips purpose-built for specialized use cases like artificial intelligence. Additionally, Broadcom earns infrastructure software revenue from cybersecurity, monitoring, and virtualization products.

Broadcom is the leading provider of ASICs with 35% market share, while its closest competitor Marvell Technology holds 12% market share. It is also the leader in networking and wireless chips. That puts Broadcom in a good position because AI adoption is driving demand for ASICs and networking chips. Analysts at Goldman Sachs recently wrote, ""Alongside Nvidia, we view Broadcom as a critical piece to the ongoing AI infrastructure build-out.""

Broadcom reported solid financial results in the second quarter, beating estimates on the top and bottom lines. Revenue surged 43% to $12.5 billion on particularly strong demand for AI chips and virtualization software. Meanwhile, GAAP net income declined 46% to $4.42 per diluted share, but that was due to costs associated with its 2023 acquisition of VMware. Non-GAAP operating income increased 32% during the second quarter.

Broadcom is a hidden gem among AI stocks because Nvidia casts a long shadow. But its strong position in ASICs and networking chips should be a source of momentous revenue growth in the coming years. Indeed, management expects AI chips to account for 25% of its semiconductor solutions revenue in 2025, up from 15% in 2023.

However, Wall Street expects the company to grow earnings per share at 17% annually over the next three to five years. That makes its current valuation of 69 times earnings look expensive, especially when the three-year average is 32 times earnings. To be fair, earnings may grow more quickly than anticipated depending on how the VMware integration progresses. But I plan to avoid the stock until the valuation appears more reasonable. To that end, I see little chance of an 70% return over the next 12 months.

Yahoo Finance,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/why-nikola-surged-over-25-175726714.html,2024-07-02,17:57:26 UTC,Why Nikola Surged Over 25% at One Point Today,"Shares of electric and hydrogen-fueled truck maker Nikola (NASDAQ: NKLA) rallied over 26% at one point today, before settling into a 16% gain as of 1:13 p.m. ET.

The rally was fueled by the company's disclosure of hydrogen truck deliveries for the second quarter, which greatly exceeded expectations. With Nikola's past problems and loss-making financials having beaten the stock down to very low levels, it's no wonder the good news sparked a reversal.

72 hydrogen deliveries

In the second quarter, Nikola reported 72 HYLA Class 8 hydrogen-powered truck deliveries to wholesalers. That was well above the high end of 60 it had forecast for the quarter in its previous guidance. In addition, Nikola noted a new customer in Walmart Canada, which had purchased vehicles for the first time, while existing customers increased purchases through Nikola's dealer network.

The 72 deliveries almost double the first quarter's 40 and brought Nikola's total year-to-date deliveries to 112. Nikola CEO Steve Girsky said, ""We are firmly on the field and are continuing to secure our first-mover advantage in zero-emissions Class 8 trucks in North America, as well as with our HYLA hydrogen refueling solutions.""

It's good news for Nikola and the prospects for hydrogen-powered trucks. The long-haul trucking industry may be difficult to electrify due to weight concerns, but hydrogen is a zero-emissions fuel that produces only water as a byproduct. That being said, hydrogen does take energy to produce, so it's only a zero-emission fuel if produced with green energy.

Moreover, the retail price of hydrogen, according to a Nikola press release last month, is currently $32 per kg. That's high, far exceeding the cost to produce hydrogen. However, Nikola believes as more hydrogen trucks get on the road and infrastructure is developed, those costs will come down.

Nikola still has a lot to prove

Today's stock pop is somewhat encouraging, but can likely be attributed to short-covering, as 20% of Nikola's shares were sold short as of June 14. The company was also forced to execute a 1-for-30 reverse stock split last month, as its share price had fallen below $1 in violation of Nasdaq rules.

Fundamentally, the company burned through over $130 million in the first quarter alone, but only has about $345 million in unrestricted cash left on its balance sheet. That means Nikola needs to get more profitable fast or raise money in a high-interest environment. So despite today's rise, investors should wait until the dust clears and Nikola is on a sustainably profitable path before investing.

BBC Business,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cv2g0w81e45o,2024-07-02,06:23:19 UTC,Sainsbury's hit as wet weather dampens Argos sales,"Sainsbury's hit as wet weather dampens Argos sales

Sainsbury's has reported a slowdown in sales after the soggy spring weather hit trading at its Argos business.

The UK's second largest supermarket said it had seen strong food sales, but the wet weather hit demand for garden equipment and outdoor furniture at Argos.

Cost of living pressures also hit non-food sales, and Sainsbury's boss Simon Roberts said he expected consumers to remain cautious until interest rates start to fall.

One analyst suggested the Argos business was an ""albatross"" around the supermarket's neck.

Sales overall were up 3% in the 16 weeks to 22 June, Sainsbury's said, but this was slower than in the previous quarter.

Food sales rise 4.8%, with Nectar offers and Aldi price matching helping to attract shoppers.

Sainsbury's also said its 'Taste the Difference' premium own brand range had seen sales jump by 14%.

However, sales of non-food items were down and Argos saw sales drop 6.2%. Along with the wet weather, the retailer said cost-of-living pressures meant shoppers were still cautious about spending on big ticket items.

Argos also saw weaker demand for consumer electronics, particularly in gaming.

Mr Roberts said it was not surprising that consumers were being cautious given the pressure on household finances and he did not expect this to change until there were ""sequential"" cuts in interest rates.

However, he added that the weather was a key factor in how and when customers choose to spend. The recent spell of hot weather had triggered a spike in sales of items such as fans and paddling pools.","Sainsbury's hit as wet weather dampens Argos salesSainsbury's has reported a slowdown in sales after the soggy spring weather hit trading at its Argos business.

The cyber truck has been selling well, although it is a tiny part of Tesla's business

Tesla sales, hit by a significant slump earlier this year, may be showing signs of revival.

Elon Musk's electric car-maker delivered nearly 444,000 vehicles in the three months ended 30 June, up more than 14% from the prior quarter.

That was far more than most analysts had expected - though still down nearly 5% from the same period in 2023.

Tesla has been navigating a slowdown in demand, as high borrowing costs weigh on buyers and competition increases.

It has slashed prices repeatedly to try to win back shoppers, while also introducing low-cost borrowing plans.

But its success in this has been limited.

The firm, which announced plans in April to sack more than 10% of its workforce, has seen sales fall in the first half of the year.

At the start of the year, Tesla blamed its poor performance in part on supply shortages due to shipping disruption in the Red Sea and an alleged arson attack at its factory in Germany.

But analysts say Tesla needs to freshen its line-up, if it hopes to stop rivals from making inroads.

The company started selling its cyber-truck last year but that remains a tiny part of its business. Its mainstream Model 3 sedan dates to 2017.","Tesla surprises with better than expected car salesThe cyber truck has been selling well, although it is a tiny part of Tesla's businessTesla sales, hit by a significant slump earlier this year, may be showing signs of revival.

10 hours ago By Kevin Peachey , BBC News Share

Getty Shoplifting is one of the issues on which BBC audiences said they wanted more detail from parties

Key issues such as the NHS, the economy and immigration have dominated this election campaign. They are well covered in all the parties' manifestos, but some other topics only get a few words, or none at all. The BBC's Your Voice, Your Vote project was an invitation to tell us what matters to you. Big subjects such as climate change and housing dominated your responses. The parties too have covered those big issues at length, and have responded to the questions asked by voters.

But there are other points you raised, albeit in smaller numbers, that barely get a mention in the manifestos. Here is a selection of them.

Getty Images Local councils are primarily responsible for regulating fly-tipping

Litter and fly-tipping

Your Voice, Your Vote is not a scientific project, but it does allow you to have your say. These topics are far from the most common in your responses, but carry great strength of feeling. Diane from Worcestershire says litter and fly-tipping are at ""epidemic levels"" while Christine, 33, from Surrey is shocked by ""the sheer amount of rubbish everywhere"". Martin, 42, from Perthshire asks: ""What are the parties going to do to enforce the law and what new initiatives will be taken to improve this worrying situation? It appears no parties are interested.""

The Conservatives do have a sentence in their manifesto with a proposal to make fly-tipping an offence which would carry a sanction of penalty points on a driving licence. When it spelled out this policy earlier in the campaign, opposition parties responded with claims that cases had been high but resulted in a low proportion of fines. Labour says fly-tippers will be forced to clean up their mess. There may be good reason why litter and fly-tipping are rarely mentioned. Local councils are primarily responsible for this area of policy, so they were more dominant during local elections earlier in the year.

Shoplifting

Although surveys give slightly differing figures on shoplifting, cases are at, or near, the highest level seen for 20 years. The BBC has reported on vulnerable women and children being trafficked to the UK to shoplift for Eastern European crime groups. Retail worker Allan wrote to say he faced shoplifting and threatening behaviour on a daily basis.

Getty Images Surveys suggest cases of shoplifting are about the worst they have been for 20 years

Amanda in Bristol says shoplifting has become ""normalised"", but there are contrasting views on the best way to tackle such a crime. The parties do devote whole chapters of their manifestos to how they would deal with crime. However, there is little mention of shoplifting in particular, although Labour plans to introduce a specific offence of assaults on shopworkers.

Assisted dying

Scotland, Jersey and the Isle of Man are all considering changing the law to let terminally ill people end their lives. Campaigner Dame Esther Rantzen wants Westminster MPs to vote on assisted dying too, while Liz Carr, a comedian, actress and disability rights campaigner, has been a vocal opponent. Views on both sides of the debate are clear from your comments. Lynne from Kent and Anne from Lancashire both ask whether the parties would put legalisation of assisted dying to a referendum, while Oliver, aged 29, from Bedfordshire says it is ""an important social issue"" which has not had an airing in this campaign. However, John from Devon says it would be ""nonsense"" to allow assisted dying in any form. Only the Greens suggest in their manifesto that a change in the law is needed. The Conservatives describe it as a ""matter of conscience"" - both they, and the Liberal Democrats, say it should go to a free vote in Parliament.

Income tax thresholds

""The main issue I'd like to see the parties wake up to is personal tax thresholds,"" says Elizabeth, aged 44, from Cambridgeshire. ""Keeping these frozen until 2028 is crippling hard working families and it’s just not fair or right."" Not everyone agrees with Elizabeth, with some people pointing out that tax rises would be necessary to improve essential public services. Tax thresholds mark the level of income at which different rates of income tax are paid. They have been frozen, when they would normally be expected to rise in line with prices.

This issue has been raised regularly during debates, interviews and in commentary, such as this piece by the BBC's economics editor, Faisal Islam, but less so in manifestos. Labour, the Liberal Democrats and the Conservatives will all keep the freeze for the next three years. Reform and the Workers Party of Britain say they would raise the starting income tax threshold to £20,000 and £21,200 respectively, although questions have been raised over how this would be funded. Tax bands differ in Scotland, and the SNP says it wants full devolution of tax powers.

Getty Images Fox-hunting was banned in England and Wales in 2004 but some people feel more needs to be done

Hunting

Toni from Devon is among those saying: ""The ban on hunting needs to be strengthened."" Fox-hunting has been a major issue in previous election campaigns, before and after it was banned in England and Wales by the Labour government in 2004. There is different legislation in Scotland, and it is still permitted in Northern Ireland.

Labour and the Greens say they would ban trail hunting, which sees hounds and riders follow a pre-laid scent along an agreed route. The Conservatives and Labour want to ban the import of hunting trophies.

Rupert Murdoch's Fox Corporation is entering the UK's highly competitive free, ad-supported video streaming market.

Tubi will compete with the likes of Netflix, Disney+, ITVX and Channel 4's streaming platform as well as the BBC iPlayer.

The platform has been quickly gaining market share in the US where, according to Fox, it has almost 80 million monthly active users.

In the UK, Tubi says it will launch with more than 20,000 films and TV series, including content from Disney, Lionsgate, NBCUniversal and Sony Pictures Entertainment.

The platform will also include a selection of British, Indian and Nigerian content.

UK viewers will be able to access content on the Tubi webpage, via a smartphone app and on smart TVs.

“Tubi has spent the last decade honing our approach to vast, free and fun streaming in North America, and we feel that now is the perfect time to bring that recipe to UK audiences,” Tubi chief executive Anjali Sud said.

Fox Corporation bought Tubi in 2020 for $440m (£348m) as the US media giant looked to attract younger audiences.","Fox set to launch free Netflix rival in UKRupert Murdoch's Fox Corporation is entering the UK's highly competitive free, ad-supported video streaming market.

9 hours ago By Harrison Jones , BBC News Share

BBC The highest debt known to the Student Loan Company now stands at more than £250,000

Almost 1.8 million people are now in at least £50,000 of UK student debt, data obtained by BBC News reveals. More than 61,000 have balances of above £100,000, figures from the Student Loans Company (SLC) also show, while another 50 people each owe upwards of £200,000. The statistics were released after a Freedom of Information (FOI) request for the number of loan holders with above average debts who are eligible to start repayments. The SLC previously said the average balance for loan holders in England when they start making repayments was less than £45,000. New government data shows that amount has now risen to £48,470. Balances can be significantly higher for those who study multiple or lengthy courses and often rise rapidly with interest. In 2023/24, some 2.8 million people in England made a student loan repayment, according to government figures released after the FOI response. That means only a small fraction of those repaying their balances are in more than £100,000 of debt - but the majority do owe more than £50,000. It comes after the BBC revealed earlier this year that the highest UK student debt was more than £231,000. Around three months later, that figure has now hit £252,000. Tom Allingham, from website Save The Student, said such balances were ""alarming"" but were “in no way indicative of the norm”. Personal finance expert Martin Lewis told the BBC the debts should be seen more like a ""limited form of graduate tax"".

Speaking on Radio 4's Today programme, he explained: ""Student finance for the vast majority of students is not about what you owe, but what you earn - you repay 9% of everything above a threshold."" For example, those on ""Plan 2 loans"" would pay 9% of everything earned over £27,295. The National Union of Students (NUS) branded it “ridiculous” that none of the main parties are offering ""reform"" of student finance in the election campaign. Debts are written off at the end of loan terms, regardless of how much is owed by that point. The terms are often 30 or 40 years, but depend on your course and start date. Heavily-indebted graduates have also spoken to BBC News about their concerns with the current system.

Titi, a senior electrical engineer from Croydon who asked for his full name not to be used, saw his student debt - which stands at more than £128,200 - rise by £788.11 between 6 April and 6 June this year. “No matter how much I pay it is always increasing,” he said, referencing the near 8% interest rate on accounts like his, which is driven by high inflation. The father-of-one, 43, told the BBC he feels it is impossible to pay back the balance in full following his four-year course at London South Bank University and two years studying for a Higher National Diploma. “It seems like a money-making avenue when you look at the (interest) rates applied to the loans,” he said. Titi said he fears some people may be discouraged from higher education “when they do the calculations” and consider what they could earn without a degree.

Titi Titi saw his student debt rise by £788.11 between 6 April and 6 June

It is more than 10 years since tuition fees were tripled in England. From 2017, fees have cost a maximum of £9,250 per year across the UK, though in Scotland, Scottish students are charged a maximum of £1,820 and in Northern Ireland, the current maximum tuition fee for full-time undergraduates is £4,710. Many people who borrowed ""exceptional amounts"" on so-called ""Plan 2"" loans - which were introduced when fees were tripled - are unlikely to pay the full amount back, according to Ben Waltmann, from the Institute for Fiscal Studies. But Claire Callender, a professor of higher education policy and deputy director of the Centre for Global Higher Education, told the BBC that owing such high amounts is ""likely to have a negative impact on graduates' lives"".

It is not clear whether the largest debt now known to the SLC - of £252,000 - is on the same loan as the one revealed to be the highest in March, at £231,000. Nick Hillman, the director of the Higher Education Policy Institute, told the BBC he was ""most shocked"" by the number of people in more than £200,000 of student debt. He pointed out that the data suggests that fewer than 50 people owe at least £10m between them. ""Clearly, at that level, the student loan system is not working well because these people will not pay it all back"", Mr Hillman said.

'People will not pay it all back'

In its response to the FOI request, the SLC said people with higher than average balances ""may be in receipt of several student loan products"", including an Advanced Learner Loan for further education courses and funding for undergraduate courses, postgraduate Master’s courses and postgraduate Doctoral courses. It said other factors behind high student debts could also include loan holders studying multiple or lengthier courses or holding more than one loan plan type. The company added that some students receive additional funding due to ""compelling personal reasons"". Despite being in more than £101,500 of debt, foundation year 2 doctor Abbie Tutt is pleased the system does not impact credit scores. But Dr Tutt - who posted a video on social media ""celebrating"" her balance passing £100,000 - is unhappy about how long she will be paying it off for. The 27-year-old says the debt is saddening when she compares it to that of older colleagues who paid their loans off when terms were more favourable.

Abbie Tutt Dr Abbie Tutt says comparing her debt with that of older colleagues who have paid it off is saddening

She characterises her debt as a tax. Dr Tutt told the BBC: “If you’re going to uni because it’s your passion and you are going to get a good job and be happy then you could justify it. “But I am not comfortable with people being in that much debt and not getting a job.”

11 hours ago By Andrew Rogers and Tom Richardson , BBC Newsbeat Share

BBC/Getty/PA Voters are due to select their favoured party on 4 July

You've heard politicians talking about tax, immigration and the economy, but there's one topic they don't tend to mention. Video games. The UK's games industry is globally respected, employs an estimated 76,000 people and is thought to bring £6bn a year to the UK economy. It's also a sector in the middle of a crisis. Over the last 18 months thousands of workers worldwide have lost their jobs and studios have been shut down. Much of the focus has been on big names such as Microsoft and Sony, both of which have laid off hundreds of staff in 2024. But smaller studios are feeling the pinch too. ""It’s not great and I think it’s pretty obvious,"" says Greg Lee. ""Every industry is struggling right now. But investment is drying up, people don’t want to take the risk right now. ""And a lot of studios are suffering heavily because of that."" Greg's the founder of Team Terrible, makers of viral hit indie horror game The Baby in Yellow. Described as a ""Lovecraftian babysitting game"" it's been downloaded millions of times.

Team Terrible founder Greg Lee chose Dundee for the team's base

Since then, Team Terrible has moved into an office on Dundee's waterfront - a hub for game developers. It grew out of 4J Studios, which found success developing Minecraft for mobiles and consoles. The Scottish city has a rich gaming heritage and - stop us if you've heard this one before - is the birthplace of Grand Theft Auto. Thanks to its reputation and earlier investment in its development scene, Greg says, Dundee's a great place to make games. ""It's a very, very small city, which means that all the game studios know each other very well,"" he says. ""So there's definitely much more feeling of community, at local events you'll pretty much meet the entire range of all studios here. ""And I think that's really important. So it's very easy to find new talent because you know most of the people in the city and it's a really, really good place to grow because there's people around to support you.""

Team Terrible Don't have nightmares: The Baby in Yellow has been a runaway success for Team Terrible.

According to industry trade body UK Interactive Entertainment (UKIE) there are more than 2,000 gaming businesses in Britain. Like Dundee, towns and cities such as Manchester, Guildford, Cambridge and Brighton are home to clusters of large and small games developers. Team Terrible staff Fergus Coyne and Jonathan Rodger say they've benefited from having other people in the industry close by. ""People nearby that share the same passion as you do, you're never feeling alone,"" says Jonathan, a Dundee native. ""You can talk to people about projects, you basically are fighting the same battles."" Both studied in the city before finding jobs in gaming, and say having a community around them is a bonus. But Fergus, who's originally from Stirling, says the industry is a ""scary place"" at the moment, and believes more could be done to help developers. ""As of now, gaming's still not recognised as its own sector,"" he says. ""It's lumped in with the screen industry, which includes film and TV. ""So having it not recognised in its entirety doesn't really bode well for us feeling like we're being represented. ""There's more talking happening, but there's still been no concrete information coming through.""

Fergus and Jonathan say more needs to be done for the gaming industry to feel represented

How can MPs help the games industry?

Both Labour and the Conservatives mention gaming in their manifesto plans for economic growth, but with no specific policies. The SNP and Lib Dems say they want to rejoin the EU’s Creative Europe scheme that could provide funding for studios. Greg says that he'd like to see politicians engage more with the games industry to go beyond a ""cookie cutter solution"". ""I think more investigation needs to be put in to see what individual studios need at different scales,"" he says. He believes the UK's setup for supporting games companies is ""antiquated"" compared with countries such as Canada, and says he's seen a ""brain drain"" of talented people moving abroad where wages are higher. ""I think in order to reverse that we need to change policy to encourage students to set up here to give opportunities to bring back some of those developers to the UK,"" he says.

Despite gaming becoming a bigger part of people's lives, UKIE CEO Nick Poole says, it's ""still getting relatively little airplay within the the national political dialogue"". He says it's important for the UK to be ""at the forefront"" of the changing landscape ""We have a new Hollywood right on our shores,"" he says. ""The video game industry is global, the UK has an amazing heritage in that industry, we want it to have a really, really bright future in the industry as well. ""And so we need government to demonstrate that they care about the success of the UK video game sector."" Nick says UKIE wants parties to support developers through tax reliefs, introduce a ""digital creativity GCSE"" and for the next government to increase investment in the gaming sector. Like Greg, he wants to see support that's tailored towards the industry, rather than mirroring schemes set up for other creative fields such as film and TV. ""We really want to sit down with them and work with them on solutions that genuinely work to scale up video games,"" he says. Nick says he's hopeful that a younger generation of MPs more in touch with gaming will be more receptive.

What do the parties say?

BBC Newsbeat approached the Conservatives, Labour, the Liberal Democrats and the SNP to ask for further detail on how they'd support the games industry. Thangam Debbonaire, Labour’s shadow culture, media and sport secretary, said the party would ""focus on Britain’s world class creative industries - like gaming - to create jobs and boost the economy"". “We’ll open up education and cultural opportunities, accessible to all. We’d bring in a new plan for creative industries and do an expert review on embedding creative learning in schools,"" she said. A Liberal Democrat spokesperson said: ""The UK's thriving video game industry makes a huge contribution to our economy and is responsible for thousands of good jobs, and we need to ensure it continues to go from strength to strength. ""The Liberal Democrats are calling for a proper industrial strategy to give our digital industries the support and certainty they need, and for serious investment in skills training so that more people are able to access opportunities in tech."" The Conservatives and The SNP haven't yet added to what's in their manifestos.

The Unite union has called off a strike planned for 8 July so that further talks can take place over the future of the UK’s largest steel works at Port Talbot in Wales. Owners Tata had been planning to shut one blast furnace at the site in September and one this Thursday, but then threatened to shut both this week due to safety fears over a staff walkout. Unite’s strike action was called to the dismay of other unions who feared that it would accelerate the closures and hasten job losses. The Community and GMB unions had hoped that waiting until blast furnace four closed in September would give them time for more negotiations to extend its life, with a potentially new government in place.

Unite general secretary Sharon Graham said the talks were ""essential"". ""Workers were simply not prepared to stand idly by while steel making ended and their communities were laid to waste,"" she said, saying the focus should be on fresh investment and the continuation of long-term steel making in the region.

Tata has been in talks with unions since January when it unveiled plans to radically transform its south Wales operations to deal with financial losses and to reduce its carbon emissions. With government help, the steel giant plans to build a new electric arc furnace that recycles scrap metal and is less energy intensive - a move it says will secure the future of steel making at the site. However, it would need far fewer staff and require the closure of the two existing furnaces at Port Talbot, resulting in 2,800 job losses. Extending the life of one of them would save 2,000 of those jobs if the remaining blast furnace was left on until the new electric arc furnace has been built on the site, which could take up to three years.

'Dangerous game'

Unite, which had pulled out of the talks, was already taking industrial action such as banning overtime and was due to stage an all-out strike from next Monday. However, last week Tata threatened to close both furnaces within days unless it could ""safely and stably operate"" them during the strike. It then wrote to all three unions, offering to begin new talks if the action was called off.

Other unions have welcomed the news but have criticised Unite for giving Tata an excuse to shut the furnaces early. Sources familiar with the situation accused the union of “playing a very dangerous game of brinkmanship with everyone's jobs”. But Unite officials rejected the claims, saying their action “had helped focus minds”. They are also claiming a victory of sorts over the news that further talks will take place after the election. However, in a letter to unions from Tata - seen by the BBC - it is clear the company had already agreed to further talks after the upcoming election.

surf Mission accomplished for Edwin Verheul (left) and Joachim Opdenakker

In February, deep inside a warehouse at Cern, the Swiss home of the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) – the world’s biggest science experiment – two network engineers held their breath. And pressed a button. Suddenly, text on a black background flashed up on a screen in front of them. It had worked. “There was high-fiving involved,” recalls Joachim Opdenakker at SURF, a Dutch IT association that works for educational and research institutions. “It was super-cool to see.” He and his colleague Edwin Verheul had just set up a new data link between the LHC in Switzerland and data storage sites in The Netherlands. A data link that could reach speeds of 800 gigabits per second (Gbps) – or more than 11,000 times the average UK home broadband speed. The idea is to improve scientists’ access to the results of LHC experiments. A subsequent test in March using special equipment on loan from Nokia proved the desired speeds were achievable. “This transponder that Nokia uses, it’s like a celebrity,” says Mr Verheul, explaining how the kit is booked up for use at various locations in advance. “We had limited time to do tests. If you have to postpone a week, then the transponder is gone.” This amount of bandwidth, approaching one terabit per second, is extremely fast but some subsea cables are a few hundred times faster still – they use multiple fibre strands to achieve such speeds.

Nokia & Surf After its upgrade the Large Hadron Collider will produce five times as much data

In labs around the world, networking experts are coming up with fibre optic systems capable of pushing data around even more rapidly than this. They are reaching extraordinary speeds of many petabits per second (Pbps), or 300 million times the average UK home broadband connection. This is so fast that one can barely imagine how people will use such bandwidth in the future. But engineers are wasting no time in proving that it is possible. And they only want to go faster. The duplex cable (with cores that either send or receive) from Cern to data centres in The Netherlands is just shy of 1,650km (I,025 miles) long, snaking from Geneva to Paris, then Brussels, and finally Amsterdam. Part of the challenge in reaching 800 Gbps was in beaming pulses of light such a long way. “Due to the distance, the power levels of that light decrease, so you have to amplify it at different locations,” explains Mr Opdenakker. Every time one tiny subatomic particle smashes into another during experiments at the LHC, the impact generates staggering volumes of data – about one petabyte per second. That’s enough to fill 220,000 DVDs. This is slimmed down for storage and study, but still requires hefty amounts of bandwidth. Plus, with an upgrade due by 2029, the LHC expects to produce even more scientific data than it does today. “The upgrade increases the number of collisions by at least a factor of five,” says James Watt, senior vice president and general manager of optical networks at Nokia.

A time when 800 Gbps seems slow may not be far away, however. In November, a team of researchers in Japan broke the world speed record for data transmission when they reached an astonishing 22.9 Pbps. That’s enough bandwidth to supply every single person on the planet, and then a couple billion more, with a Netflix stream, says Chigo Okonkwo at Eindhoven University of Technology, who was involved in the work. In this case, a meaningless but huge stream of pseudorandom data was beamed over 13km of coiled fibre optic cable in a lab setting. Dr Okonkwo explains that the integrity of the data is analysed post-transfer to confirm it was sent as quickly as reported without accumulating too many errors. He also adds that the system he and colleagues used relied on multiple cores – a total of 19 cores inside one fibre cable. This is a new type of cable unlike the standard ones that connect many people’s home to the internet.

But older fibre is expensive to dig up and replace. Extending its lifetime is useful, argues Wladek Forysiak at Aston University in the UK. He and colleagues have recently achieved speeds of around 402 terabits per second (Tbps) along a 50km-long optical fibre with just one core. That’s about 5.7 million times faster than the average UK home broadband connection. “I think it’s a world best, we don’t know of any results that are better than that,” says Prof Forysiak. Their technique relies on using more wavelengths of light than usual when flashing data down an optical line. For this they use alternative forms of the electronic equipment that sends and receives signals over fibre optic cables but such a setup could be easier to install than replacing thousands of kilometres of the cable itself. Activities in the so-called metaverse might one day require extreme bandwidth, suggests Martin Creaner, director general of the World Broadband Association. His organisation expects home broadband connections to reach up to 50 Gbps by 2030. But reliability may be even more important than speed for some applications. “For remote robotic surgery across 3,000 miles… you absolutely do not want any scenario where the network goes down,” says Mr Creaner. Dr Okonkwo adds that training AI will increasingly require moving huge datasets around. The faster this can be done, the better, he argues. And Ian Phillips, who works alongside Prof Forysiak, says bandwidth tends to find applications once it is available: “Humanity finds a way of consuming it.”

TeleGeography Demand for bandwidth is growing surprisingly fast says Lane Burdette","“It was super-cool to see.” He and his colleague Edwin Verheul had just set up a new data link between the LHC in Switzerland and data storage sites in The Netherlands.

High mortgage rates mean affordability is still ""stretched"" for many home buyers, according to the Nationwide. The building society said that while earnings had been rising faster than house prices in recent years, this had not been enough to offset the impact of more expensive mortgages. Its comments came as it said house price growth had been ""broadly stable"" in June, with prices up 0.2% from the previous month. The average house price is now £266,064, the lender said.

Prices were up 1.5% from a year earlier, but Nationwide said activity in the housing market had been ""broadly flat"" over the past 12 months, with transactions down by about 15% compared with 2019. The lender said the market was still being affected by the increase in mortgage rates, which started climbing after the Bank of England began to raise its key interest rate in late 2021. Robert Gardner, Nationwide's chief economist, said that mortgage rates are ""still well above the record lows prevailing in 2021 in the wake of the pandemic"". ""For example, the interest rate on a five-year fixed rate mortgage for a borrower with a 25% deposit was 1.3% in late 2021, but in recent months this has been nearer to 4.7%. ""As a result, housing affordability is still stretched."" Nationwide's figures are based on the building society's own mortgage lending, which does not include buyers who purchase homes with cash, or buy-to-let deals. Cash buyers account for about a third of housing sales. The impact of higher borrowing costs can be seen in the fact that transactions involving a mortgage are down by nearly 25% over the past year, Nationwide said. Meanwhile the number of cash transactions for properties is about 5% higher than pre-pandemic levels. Across the UK, Northern Ireland saw the biggest price increases, up 4.1% from a year earlier. Wales and Scotland both saw a 1.4% annual rise. Prices in England climbed by 0.6%, with northern regions seeing bigger increases in general than the south.

Despite some major lenders cutting their mortgage rates last week, home loan costs remain far higher than pre-pandemic levels. According to financial information service Moneyfacts, the average rate on a two-year fixed mortgage deal stands at 5.95%, while for a five-year deal the average is 5.53%. The focus is now on the Bank of England's Monetary Policy Committee (MPC), which sets interest rates, to see if it decides to cut at its next meeting on 1 August. June's MPC meeting saw a change in tone from policymakers, with suggestions that the Bank could vote for a rate cut next month. ""Buyers may find their mojo again when we get a rate cut from the Bank of England,"" said Sarah Coles, head of personal finance at Hargreaves Lansdown. ""This could come as early as August, although sticky services inflation and higher wages could mean we need to wait until the autumn. ""Either way, we’re not expecting massive overnight drops in mortgage rates, so the reaction is more likely to be a muted upturn in sentiment than an overwhelming wave of optimism.""

Last week, the Bank said that about three million households are set to see their mortgage payments rise in the next two years. These are homeowners who arranged mortgage deals before the Bank started to lift rates in 2021. These deals are now expiring, and the Bank said the majority will finish before the end of 2026. For the typical household looking for a new deal, monthly mortgage repayments are forecast to increase by about £180, or about 28%, the Bank said. However, for around 400,000 households, monthly payments could jump by 50% or more. Bank of England figures released on Monday showed a small fall in the number of mortgages approved in May, down to 60,000 from 60,800 in April. However, the data also showed the amount borrowed through mortgages dropped sharply to £1.2bn in May, from £2.2bn the month before, although this does not include those remortgaging with the same lender.

Need to refinance £80m loan

It said the delay in its accounts was due to discussions with its auditors about the correct way to account for revenues from complex, multi-year contracts.

It added that agreement had been reached and ""the company will now progress to complete the audit quickly and expects to publish its 2023 annual report during the week commencing 8 July 2024"".

Harland and Wolff was bought out of administration in 2019 and in 2022 was part of the consortium which won a major contract to build three Royal Navy support ships.

The company has had to invest significantly to prepare for that work and has been heavily loss making.

The audited annual accounts for 2022 showed turnover of £28m and a loss of about £70m.

In the previous 17 month accounting period, the loss was more than £25m.

The company has applied for a £200m loan guarantee, which is essential for its financial stability.

It needs to refinance an £80m high interest loan and take on new borrowings as it scales up its operations.

It is seeking to borrow from a consortium of UK banks, but needs the government to act as guarantor - meaning if the loans were to go bad the state would step in to repay the lenders.

The company said it expects the government to reach a decision on the guarantee after this week’s general election.

It added that should there be any ""any material delays"" to guarantee, its ability to ""execute new and large contracts would be adversely affected"".","Harland and Wolff posts £43m lossHarland and Wolff has reiterated its need for a £200m government loan guarantee to help stabilise its financesThe company has reiterated its need for a £200m government loan guarantee to help stabilise its finances.

A drop in domestic gas and electricity prices has now taken effect, but costs are expected to rise again in October. Regulator Ofgem's new price cap for England, Wales and Scotland came into force on Monday, meaning a typical household's energy bill will fall by £122 a year. That brings down the bill for a household using a typical amount of gas and electricity to £1,568 a year, the lowest for two years. But forecasters expect it to rise again in the run-up to winter, more than reversing the latest drop.

Leading consultancy Cornwall Insight predicts that a typical household's annual bill will be back up to £1,723 in October, a £155, or 10%, increase from now. ""Modest falls in summer look set to be wiped out by bigger rises in autumn when people will need to put the heating back on,"" said Adam Scorer, chief executive of charity National Energy Action. ""The cost of energy remains an unaffordable luxury that many of the poorest simply cannot afford."" Although the price cap is changed every three months, it is illustrated by Ofgem in terms of an annual bill for a household using a typical amount of gas and electricity. People in larger properties will tend to pay more overall owing to higher energy usage, and those in smaller properties will pay less.

That is because the cap, set by Ofgem, limits the maximum price that can be charged for each unit of gas and electricity - not the total bill. It affects the gas and electricity bills of 28 million households, but does not impact customers in Northern Ireland, where the sector is regulated differently but where prices are also falling.

Energy bills are considerably lower than the peak after Russia's invasion of Ukraine, when the government stepped in to limit bill rises. That has fed through to falls in the general rate of rising prices, known as inflation. However, a typical household's energy bill remains about £400 higher than three years ago, prompting debate over the issue during the election campaign.

In addition, households have built up a collective debt to suppliers of about £3bn owing, primarily, to the pressure from high prices. Those on prepayment meters, who tend to top up meters during the colder, darker months and are often under more financial pressure, will see a less immediate impact of a drop in prices in the summer. The vast majority of households pay by direct debit, and their payments are smoothed out over the year. They should have been contacted by their supplier about the latest price changes. Experts say it is a good idea to take a meter reading now, to ensure billpayers are charged at the correct rate. Ofgem is reviewing the way the price cap is calculated, including sifting through a host of responses to a consultation on standing charges.

Latest changes in detail

The new prices that took effect for July to the end of September mean: Gas prices are now capped at 5.48p per kilowatt hour (kWh), and electricity at 22.36p per kWh

A typical household uses 2,700 kWh of electricity a year, and 11,500 kWh of gas

Households on pre-payment meters pay slightly less than those on direct debit, with a typical bill of £1,522

Those who pay their bills every three months by cash or cheque pay more, with a typical bill of £1,668

Standing charges - a fixed daily charge covering the costs of connecting to a supply - are unchanged at 60p a day for electricity and 31p a day for gas, although they vary by region

Dave Ricks urged the next government to consider how it could become ""world class"" in attracting investment

The boss of the world's most valuable pharmaceutical company has told the BBC that the UK's planning system puts companies off investing in the country.

Dave Ricks, chief executive of the obesity drug manufacturer Eli Lilly, said he had considered building a factory in the UK in the last decade, but chose another country instead.

He warned current planning processes were an ""impediment"" to building factories at speed, unlike in the US and Ireland.

""Mostly what they do is they pre-reserve land, they promise to cut through the red tape and layers of government,"" Mr Ricks said.

Eli Lilly, along with its Danish rival Novo Nordisk, has developed a considerable lead over the rest of the pharmaceutical industry when it comes to obesity medication.

Its drugs, which include Zepbound and Mounjaro, are in such demand that the company cannot build factories quickly enough.

The country has operations in the US, Ireland and other European Union countries including Italy, France and Germany.

Mr Ricks said countries that ""could present a path"" in which the time taken to set up a pharmaceutical plant was reduced from five years to two was ""very attractive"".

""In the UK - although I love visiting, it's a wonderful county - it’s not the largest market so you have to overcome that with other attractiveness, whether that be workforce, asset delivery or economic incentives,"" he said.

""You have to be candid, say 'are we as competitive as we can be?' And to date it's been a little bit less, but I think it's not unachievable.""","UK planning laws deter investment, says drugs giantDave Ricks urged the next government to consider how it could become ""world class"" in attracting investmentThe boss of the world's most valuable pharmaceutical company has told the BBC that the UK's planning system puts companies off investing in the country.

Getty Images A lawyer representing families of victims of two fatal Boeing 737 Max crashes says they ""strenuously object to this plea deal""

A lawyer representing victims of two fatal Boeing 737 Max crashes has told the BBC that the US government is preparing to offer the plane maker a ""sweetheart plea deal"". Paul Cassell, who says he got the information ""directly from the Justice Department"", added that the deal includes a small fine, three years of probation and independent safety audits. Boeing did not immediately reply to the BBC's request for comment, while the Justice Department (DoJ) declined to provide a statement. It comes as Boeing announced it had reached a deal to buy the aerospace supplier Spirit AeroSystems - a move it said would improve quality and safety. Spirit made the fuselage that suffered a mid-flight blowout on an Alaska Airlines 737 Max 9 jet in January, sparking widespread concern about standards at Boeing.

'Families will object to this deal'

Last month, US prosecutors recommended that the DoJ bring criminal charges against the plane maker. That was after the DoJ said Boeing had violated a 2021 settlement related to the crashes which killed 346 people. ""The memory of 346 innocents killed by Boeing demands more justice than this,"" said Mr Cassell, adding that the ""families will strenuously object to this plea deal"". The plane crashes - both involving Boeing's 737 Max aircraft - occurred within six months of each other. The crash involving Indonesia's Lion Air occurred in October 2018, followed by an Ethiopian Airlines flight in March 2019. Both crashes were linked to faulty flight control systems. A letter sent last month by Mr Cassell to the DoJ revealed that the families had been seeking prosecutions of Boeing's top executives at the time of the crashes and a fine of $24.8bn (£19.6bn) for ""the deadliest corporate crime in US history"". The Justice Department has until 7 July to decide whether to revive a criminal charge of fraud brought against Boeing in 2021. That charge has lain dormant since the company acknowledged in a settlement that it had misled air-safety regulators about aspects of the 737 Max, and promised to create a new compliance system to detect and prevent further fraud. Under the deal reached in 2021, Boeing said it would pay a $2.5bn settlement and prosecutors agreed to ask the court to drop a criminal charge after three years if the company abided by certain stipulations set out in the deferred prosecution agreement. But in May, the DoJ said Boeing was in breach of the deal, stating that it had failed to ""design, implement, and enforce a compliance and ethics program to prevent and detect violations of the US fraud laws throughout its operations"".","Boeing to get 'sweetheart deal' - victims' lawyer2 days ago By João da Silva , Business reporter ShareGetty Images A lawyer representing families of victims of two fatal Boeing 737 Max crashes says they ""strenuously object to this plea deal""A lawyer representing victims of two fatal Boeing 737 Max crashes has told the BBC that the US government is preparing to offer the plane maker a ""sweetheart plea deal"".

BBC Qcells is investing billions in a solar panel factory in Georgia

The former “carpet capital of the world” is getting a multi-billion-dollar makeover. Here in the rural Georgian town of Dalton, once known for its fabric floor coverings, a Korean company called Qcells is spending $2.5bn (£2bn) to expand its solar panel factory, with another in the works. It's a bold initiative that will create 2,500 quality jobs in the next 12 months, in an area where the average household income is roughly 27% below the national average. It is hoped the project will revitalise a corner of the US whose glory days seemed over. And it's due in no small part to someone many of the residents of this Republican district would rather not credit - Joe Biden. The president's landmark 2022 Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) – his signature green legislation - offered hundreds of billions of dollars in tax incentives, credits and loans to stimulate American manufacturing in clean energy.

The most ambitious climate legislation in US history has generated a tsunami of private sector investments, with big implications for the rest of the world. And Georgia - a state President Biden hopes is in play in this year’s presidential election - has been a big beneficiary. But with four months before the president goes head-to-head against Donald Trump, the billions of dollars of new investment in this key battleground state doesn’t appear to have lifted the incumbent’s support. President Biden’s pitch is that solving the climate problem is also good for jobs. Since the law was passed, more than 300,000 clean energy jobs have been created in the US, according to the advocacy group Climate Power. And there's no doubt it’s creating opportunities in places like Dalton. Here you see Bidenomics in action - foreign and government money being used to fight climate change and build an economy from the middle out.

Qcells' Scott Moskowitz points to the massive investments in US renewables

Scott Moskowitz, head of market strategy for Qcells, says that Georgia had been a great home since 2019, but that the IRA had been an “accelerant”. Without it, he muses, the current expansion might not have happened at all. “What our industry has seen, since the IRA has passed, is more investment in the past two years in solar and clean energy manufacturing than the previous 20 years,” he says. And yet that message either isn't getting through or simply isn't resonating with locals – not even local Democrats. Jan Pourquoi, the spokesperson for the local Whitfield County Democratic Party, tells me: “In the business community, there is a resentment against that company [Qcells].” Mr Pourquoi, a Belgian expat should know. He owns one of the small carpet firms in town. We spoke in his office, overlooking the factory floor where they turn flooring remnants into small rugs. “The business community resents the fact that we have a company from South Korea coming in this area with government subsidies, while they themselves get nothing from the government,” says Mr Pourquoi, who identified as a Republican before switching parties following Trump’s election in 2016. He tells me that local voters know little about the IRA law. “Nobody cares about clean energy, not around here. That is the type of stuff that I would call the ‘latte liberals’ care about in the big city.”

Qcells Qcells has been expanding its vast factory in Dalton

Well, at least one person does, and that's Marjorie Taylor Greene, the firebrand Republican congressional representative for the district. She has touted Qcells' expansion, despite voting against the law that helped make it possible. It’s creating some awkward dynamics for Republicans. The IRA is in Donald Trump’s sights. If Republican lawmakers win big in the Congressional elections that are also taking place on 5 November, then portions of President Biden’s signature climate law could be repealed, threatening a clean energy boom happening in their communities across the US. I sat down for coffee with Kasey Carpenter, Dalton’s Republican member in the Georgia House of Representatives. We met at Oakwood Café, the bustling diner he owns along with a string of other local businesses, including a pizza joint and a boutique hotel. Mr Carpenter downplayed the potential impact on Qcells of manufacturing tax credits being rolled back. He doesn’t think it would jeopardise the solar investments in his district. But he adds that if clean energy investments were to become at risk “I’m sure we’ll be speaking with the Trump team”. Our conversation ends with him saying it would be another feather in Dalton’s cap if this carpet town could also lay claim to the title of “solar panel capital of the world”.

But that belongs to China, which controls 80% of the world’s solar panel supply chain. For years China has been investing heavily in renewable energy, and is expected to spend a staggering $675bn in 2024, according to an International Energy Agency (IEA) report. To compete, governments around the world have begun throwing hundreds of billions at the green industries of the future. In the EU, investment in clean energy is set to increase to $370bn in 2024, according to the IEA. The predicted figure for the US is $315bn. US Trade Representative Katherine Tai said last year that she hoped the US’s increased spending on renewable energy would help address the “significant distortion” in the global economy caused by China.

Kasey Carpenter, a Republican, says he is not fearful that a possible Trump government would hit the solar sector","Since the law was passed, more than 300,000 clean energy jobs have been created in the US, according to the advocacy group Climate Power.

Getty Images The former Honda site in Swindon will become a warehousing and logistics facility

Amid a vast expanse of rubble, dust and noise, a green crane yanks away at a corrugated roof like a frustrated dentist attempting to extract a particularly stubborn wisdom tooth. Swindon’s Honda factory - once one of the world’s most advanced car factories - is being demolished, three decades after it opened. This used to be one of the fastest-growing towns in Europe. It was one of the jewels in the crown of investments attracted to the UK by Margaret Thatcher’s brand of 1980s enterprise. Swindon voted for her, John Major, Tony Blair, David Cameron, Theresa May and Boris Johnson. It was also one of the first towns to declare for Brexit, by 55%. But last year, its council changed hands to Labour. The council has had to continue to accelerate cuts to local services, passing a budget with record cuts in order to stave off bankruptcy. Inflation, rising care expenses, and central government grant squeezes meant cuts to libraries, the Dial-a-Ride community transport service and dimmed street lights. There has been an almost 5% rise in council tax. The council leader has warned any further cuts will affect frontline services. What is happening in Swindon is a visible consequence of sluggish long-term economic growth. Government spending cuts, low private investment, deindustrialisation and shrinking disposable income have left scars even on what was one of the UK’s famous boom towns.

A view of shuttered shops on a Swindon street

The Honda site is set to become a warehousing and logistics facility. In another world, it would have been replaced by another major global manufacturer. Tesla, for example, was invited. Whereas five years ago the promise was to level up left-behind Northern towns, places like Swindon feel levelled down. The question about growth arising in this town is vital to whoever wins Thursday’s election. Elsewhere in the world, sites like this are being repurposed for electric car manufacturing. The Americans are pouring public money into their factories to try to compete with China, who will soon be confirmed as the world’s biggest car exporter. Emerging economies from Indonesia to Vietnam to Turkey are also investing in and growing their car industries. Indeed it was to Turkey that the entire Honda production line, including dozens of never-used industrial robots, was packed up and shipped off via the M4 and Bristol port last year. Swindon is not just about Honda. It is part of the M4 corridor where there are plenty of jobs in the knowledge sectors, and in finance, for example at the headquarters of Nationwide. The overall unemployment rate is just 2.6%, but the number of people not in work and not looking for work is 18%.

Marcus Kittridge, a former Honda engineer who now runs a cafe in the centre of town with his wife Tracey, accepts there are still “good employment prospects” but says many are at or “50p above” minimum wage, and says this has contributed to a decline in disposable income in the centre of town. “It’s like a Northern town that lost its industry in the 1970s,” he tells me. They now shut the cafe at 14:00 every day because of the high price of energy. He expects to be passing on his rising costs in higher prices for the next year or two. They have also stopped selling smoothies, after a notable decline in the availability and quality of fresh fruit, which they blame on post-Brexit changes. “We were told the quality of food was going to go up after Brexit, I can tell you now it has not. I’ve barely heard any politician mention it, but it definitely has had an impact on us,” Tracey says. Might she have been a bit unlucky with her purchases of fresh produce? “If I’m unlucky, I’m getting unlucky every single day and I’m probably the unluckiest person on earth,” she says. Their experience shows that some of the undercurrents of sluggish long-term growth - high energy prices, low disposable income, low investment, and new trade barriers can combine in unusual ways.

Gary Huett, a retired graphic designer also from Swindon who got in touch as part of the BBC's Your Voice, Your Vote project inviting you to tell us what matters, wanted to know why Swindon’s town centre looked like it was “rotting” and asked if anything could change. “We’ve now got pound shops predominantly, and the thriving night scene, packed with the yuppy set in the 1980s and 1990s has gone and decayed.”

The Conservatives say green shoots are already here. The latest growth figures for January to March show the UK now has the fastest growing economy in the G7 group of advanced economies, after last year’s brief recession. Swindon’s jobs record remains strong. On the Honda site, new investment has come, and the jobs, albeit in warehousing rather than manufacturing, will return. For Labour, Swindon - a bellwether town where residents have voted the same way as the eventual national winner for the last 40 years - shows that there are no quick fixes. They are not competing with the US or European Union (EU) with big public investments in green energy. Council spending remains unprotected and subject to the same ongoing squeeze. A looser planning regime might help build more houses or expand the solar farms that dot the countryside around the town. But the job of transformation is very real. When asked what will happen if the economy does not grow, Labour has responded by saying some variation of “I’m not defeatist” or “we can do it”. When I interviewed shadow chancellor Rachel Reeves in Swindon, I said that if she was relying on planning changes to transform growth prospects, they were going to have to be a revolutionary, almost Thatcher-style ""Big Bang"". She told me: “It’s big reform we are offering… unless we grow the economy we’re going to be stuck in a doom loop of low growth, high taxes and poor public services.” Labour’s hope is that there is a tsunami of private investment that has been held back from this country due to political and economic instability. That, the party says, can be unleashed by the tens of billions with a strong and stable pro-growth government.","Swindon’s Honda factory - once one of the world’s most advanced car factories - is being demolished, three decades after it opened.

Marks & Spencer is launching a new service for clothing repairs and alterations. From August, customers will be able to book through a dedicated online hub and have their fixed items posted back to them within seven to ten days. The work will be carried out by Deliveroo-style repairs start-up Sojo, and its in-house team of tailors, with prices starting at £5. The move comes as retailers try to encourage more sustainable habits among their shoppers.

Sojo launched during the Covid-19 pandemic in 2021 with a mission to make repairing, not simply replacing, clothing more mainstream. M&S said its partnership with Sojo aimed to provide customers with ways to extend the life of their clothing. “Through the launch of our repair service, we’re making it even easier for customers to give their clothes Another life, whether they are using our new repair service or long-standing clothes recycling scheme,"" said Richard Price, managing director of clothing & home at M&S.

Sojo's Josephine Philips wants to make repairing clothes more mainstream

Josephine Philips, Sojo's founder and chief executive, said the partnership marked ""an incredibly big step"" towards its mission of making clothes repairs more accessible. Siobhan Gehin, a retail expert and senior partner at consulting firm Roland Berger, told the BBC that by partnering with smaller, independent repair firms, large brands can provide customers with convenient alterations without having to create the infrastructure for these services themselves.

Growing trend among retailers

M&S is not alone in looking to repair services as a way to seemingly embrace and encourage sustainability. In January, Sojo took up a permanent space in Selfridges on London’s Oxford Street to provide customers with access to its clothing repairs service. The central London department store also gives shoppers access to handbag and trainer restoration services. Japanese fashion retailer Uniqlo, perhaps best known for its viral shoulder bag, offers clothing repairs and additional services such as embroidery for Uniqlo items at six of its UK stores. John Lewis has made its fashion rental service and recycling scheme a key part of its consumer-facing sustainability strategy, alongside accepting and reselling pre-loved products such as electronics and furniture. High Street stores Primark and H&M provide customers with online guides for repairing and maintaining their clothes, such as how to sew buttons and zips on to items or rework them entirely. Primark has also held free repair workshops for customers across the UK and Europe since 2022.

4 days ago Share

BBC

The computer expert who helped build the faulty Horizon software has finally spoken under oath about his involvement in the Post Office scandal. Gareth Jenkins is a key figure, having appeared as an expert witness to defend Horizon in court cases, and is now at the centre of an alleged cover-up. His appearance at the inquiry was long-awaited after being postponed twice. He gave evidence over four days - the longest run of questions any witness has faced - and gave his version of events. Here are five key moments from his evidence.

1. He thought Horizon bugs were fixed quickly

Gareth Jenkins referred to Horizon's overall reliability throughout his testimony, even challenging findings from the landmark Bates v Post Office case that identified issues with the IT system. He acknowledged ""individual problems"" affecting specific branches but asserted that, as a whole, the system was ""working well"". When questioned about bugs, Mr Jenkins admitted lacking personal knowledge of all known issues, stating he typically became involved when drafted in for problem resolution. When pressed on how he could provide court evidence without full oversight of existing problems, Mr Jenkins said: ""Bugs impacting accounts were rare. Monitoring was in place, and fixes were prompt. Therefore, live system problems were rare, making me confident in its operation."" He claimed nobody from the Post Office alerted him to unknown issues, and he didn't actively seek information about bugs he wasn't involved in fixing. Mr Jenkins admitted not realising the need for comprehensive knowledge when giving evidence and ""with hindsight would have done things differently"".

2. He was sent expert witness rules

Mr Jenkins was an “expert witness” in several prosecutions brought by the Post Office. His duty was to the courts, not the Post Office or his employer Fujitsu. His role meant disclosing any relevant information about the Horizon software – even evidence that could help sub-postmasters' cases. Lawyers should have ensured that Mr Jenkins understood this. When asked about this by Mr Beer, Mr Jenkins stated that he didn’t know about his responsibilities until the end of 2020. But Mr Beer showed him a letter from November 2005, written by lawyers working for the Post Office. The letter mentioned that he was an expert witness and, according to Mr Beer, listed his duties in an “easy-to-understand way”. After initially denying he had received it, Mr Jenkins later accepted that it was sent to him. He said he had “no recollection of having been briefed” on his duties and had “clearly forgotten” about having seen the letter.

3. He knew remote access was possible

The former ""distinguished engineer"" faced intense questioning regarding remote access – the ability of Fujitsu staff to modify sub-postmaster branch accounts without their knowledge. In his 2010 witness statement for Seema Misra's trial, he stated: ""No external systems can manipulate branch accounts without user awareness and authorisation."" During the inquiry, Mr Jenkins accepted knowing that remote access was possible but believed it happened infrequently and left a visible trail. He based this view on ""informal chats"" with other Fujitsu IT staff. The former engineer told the inquiry that he only discovered the extent of unrestricted access Fujitsu technical staff had to sub-postmaster accounts during the 2018 High Court battle.

4. He was a 'willing actor' for the Post Office

In 2005, Mr Jenkins was asked to provide a draft witness statement in the case of sub-postmaster Noel Thomas. The Post Office wanted his thoughts on how the losses could have occurred. One possibility, he said, was some sort of system failure. But the Post Office demanded changes, saying the line was potentially “very damaging"". It got deleted. The inquiry heard he was a “willing actor” in this process. He said he was happy with the changes he ended up with as it still accurately reflected what had happened but used “less emotive words"". The Post Office was applying the pressure, but he never checked with his own Fujitsu lawyers about signing off evidence that had been toned down. Earlier he was asked to explain attempts to “tweak” his statements, but Mr Jenkins believed this was more of a “tidying up” to make them easier to read. He said he pushed back when the changes went too far.

5. He was 'better with systems than people'

Four days of forensic questioning meant plenty of room for big revelations. It also meant Gareth Jenkins had nowhere to hide. It was very revealing about the character of the man who has been mentioned so many times at this inquiry. An IT specialist who spent his entire career at one company, by his own admission, he dealt “better with systems than people”. He would have been happiest engineering and designing, but found himself entangled in something very different. Something, he argues, he didn't fully understand. ""Can't you use the report I have already sent you?"" Mr Jenkins wrote to a Post Office lawyer in 2012. It is clear he was viewing the growing number of legal queries as a confusing frustration, taking him away from the tech front line. It is an annoyance that hasn't gone away. At one point, Mr Jenkins told the inquiry chair he wanted this ""over with"". Given the ongoing investigations, that seems unlikely.","What we learned from IT expert at Post Office inquiry4 days ago ShareBBCThe computer expert who helped build the faulty Horizon software has finally spoken under oath about his involvement in the Post Office scandal.

Getty Images Unite workers are set to start striking on 8 July over Tata’s plans to cut 2,800 UK jobs

Tata Steel has offered to meet unions for fresh talks on the condition strike action in south Wales is called off. In a letter to the UK Steel Committee, which represents the Community, Unite and the GMB unions, the company is believed to have offered to discuss future investment in Port Talbot. But the unions would be required to suspend future industrial action. Unite general secretary Sharon Graham told BBC Wales: ""They suspend closure, we suspend action.""

Unite workers are set to start striking on 8 July over Tata’s plans to cut 2,800 UK jobs. The union wants the company to delay the closure of the heavy end of steel production in Port Talbot, which is due to happen by the end of September. Community and GMB have a mandate from their members for strike action but have not confirmed any dates, saying they would wait until after the general election before announcing their next moves. The offer to start fresh talks with the unions follows discussions between Tata and Unite in the days since announcing the proposal to bring forward the closures of both Port Talbot blast furnaces. On Thursday the company said it would close both furnaces this week unless it could ""safely and stably operate"" them during the strike. On Sunday it wrote to all three unions, offering to begin new talks if the strike was called off. The talks are not a renegotiation of the existing plan, but focus on future investment opportunities. Alun Davies, Community’s national officer, said the letter ""simply reaffirms"" the position agreed by the unions and Tata at their last meeting on 22 May, and did not constitute a new agreement in response to Unite's actions. Unite had previously pulled away from multi-union talks, and was the only union to launch industrial action. Mr Davies said it was ""welcome"" Unite were ""reaffirming their commitment to the position they previously agreed"", that unions would agree on a memorandum of understanding before putting it to members to vote on.

Lawyers acting on behalf of two people who fell ill in an E. coli outbreak in the UK have started legal action against two leading supermarkets. Law firm Fieldfisher said on Friday it had issued letters of claim for breach of the Consumer Protection Act over own-brand sandwiches purchased in Tesco and Asda. The claims for compensation relate to a man from the South East and an 11-year-old girl in the North West. One person in England has died linked to the ongoing E. coli outbreak, the UK Health Security Agency said on Thursday, although they had underlying health conditions. The E. coli outbreak is thought to be caused by some supermarket sandwiches containing salad leaves. The large majority of cases reported so far developed symptoms before 4 June and the number of cases being reported is now falling, offering hope the outbreak may have ended. Several food manufacturers recalled some of their products as a precaution. The Food Standards Agency said lettuce is the likely source, based on tests.

Fieldfisher said the claim against Asda related to a young girl who contracted E. coli after eating an own-brand chicken salad sandwich from the supermarket. ""The girl, aged 11, developed the serious condition haemolytic uraemic syndrome (HUS), which attacks the kidneys and has been on dialysis for three weeks,"" it said. ""She was discharged home two days ago but could be at risk of permanent kidney damage. Her mother bought three of the sandwiches as part of an online delivery."" An Asda spokesman said that it had not yet received any letter from Fieldfisher regarding these claims, but added: ""As soon as we do we will review the details of the claim as a matter of urgency."" Harvinder Kaur, a director at Fieldfisher, told the PA News agency earlier on Friday that she had issued a separate letter to Tesco on behalf of a man from the South East. He was also hospitalised with E. coli symptoms after eating Tesco-branded sandwiches containing salad, the law firm claims. ""Luckily, this client did not go on to develop HUS and is now home, but for a time he was seriously ill,"" she said. ""Under the Act, companies producing food must ensure it is safe to eat. ""If it causes illness, it is a breach of their duty and those injured are eligible to claim compensation, not least to fund possible ongoing medical care."" She added that the man was a ""regular shopper"" at Tesco, buying his lunch there most weekdays as it was very close to his work. The BBC understands Tesco has yet to receive the letter from Fieldfisher.

2 days ago By Angie Brown , BBC Scotland, Edinburgh and East reporter Share

BBC Jakub Parulski, who lives with his wife and two young daughters, said they were in a 'horror story'

Residents of affordable housing developments in Edinburgh have said they are ""living in a horror story"" after being hit with a massive rise in their gas bill as costs are beginning to fall across the rest of the country. The Harvester's Way development has 180 properties which are all connected to a district heating system, where one huge gas boiler provides heating and hot water to all the homes. It is billed as a greener and more efficient way to heat their homes but it also means residents are unable to shop around for the best prices. Places For People Scotland, which operates about 1,000 homes across five sites in Edinburgh, has told residents the tariff for gas will jump 450% from 1 August, meaning people in a two-bedroom flat could be paying as much as £400 a month. It said the new heat tariff was procured at the end of last year and reflected the market conditions at the time. The unit price for gas can vary significantly and energy companies also impose standing charges, but the average UK unit price is currently just above 7p per kWh. The Harvester's Way residents were paying 4p/kWh but that is increasing to 22.18p/kWh.

Some of the residents from People For Places developments in Edinburgh who say they cannot pay their new gas bill prices

Jakub Parulski, who lives on the development with his wife Kasia and two young daughters, said his monthly gas bill will rise from £60 to £350. He said: ""These properties were aimed at affordable housing for low income families, this is not affordable by any means and we are very anxious about this. ""The problem is we can't boycott paying because we have pre-payment, pay-as-you go meters so they have us locked. ""We have no choice. The only choice we have is if we go cold with our small kids in the property."" The low carbon heating and hot water district heat network has a smart valve in each home linking payments to access to heating and hot water. As long as their account is in credit, the valve will remain open and they have access to heating and hot water. If an account runs out of credit, the valve closes until a top-up payment is made. Mr Parulski said he would not be able to sell his house because no-one would buy a property with such a high gas tariff. ""We are absolutely devastated. We are going to be locked in properties we cannot afford,"" he said. ""People will lose their homes. Some of us are looking at being homeless, some of us are nosediving into poverty. ""It is impossible now for us to sell our properties. We feel trapped and this is beginning to be a horror story and is no joke for a lot of us. ""It is really desperate.""

Henda Sankareh said she got the ""fright of her life"" at the new gas prices

The price rise was first introduced in April but delayed after residents complained. They told BBC Scotland the first they knew about their tariff changing was when credit in their pay-as-you-go meters suddenly dropped overnight. When Henda Sankareh noticed she had no hot water to wash her four-month-old baby at her rented flat on the Harvester's Way development she thought the boiler was broken. So the mother-of-two called the managers running the development to report the fault. But the 30-year-old said she got the ""fright of her life"" when they told her there was no problem with the heating and instead she had just run out of credit. She checked her meter and was shocked to see her monthly instalment had disappeared in less than a week. She said: ""They just told me the price had gone up so I needed to put more money in the meter. ""That's when I got into a panic. All the money had gone in just five days. I had had no notice or letter or email to warn me.""

Scott Walker with his wife Samantha and daughter Molly

After residents complained they had been given no warning Places for People Scotland launched an investigation. The company agreed to pay the higher tariff bill until the end of July but then residents would be locked into the new rates until the end of March 2025. In a letter to residents, it said: ""The procurement process requires us to adhere to terms and conditions known as the deed of conditions, which states we must get at least five cost quotes for price comparison before agreeing on a provider. ""Due to difficulties in finding gas suppliers for district heating, many providers chose not to participate."" Scott Walker, 50, a quality control technician living on the Harvester's Way development, said: ""I got a fright and felt very angry when I did the figures in my head and realised this was impossible to pay. ""We can't afford to move. He added: ""When we bought this house we were told this heating system was really efficient. ""We need to try to reduce the tariff. Obviously it has to go up but not that kind of percentage. It's extortionate. We would take a normal price that everyone else pays. ""I want to get an independent review done of the heating system and how they have come to these figures.""

The economy grew by more than initially estimated in the first three months of 2024 as the UK emerged from recession, revised official figures show.

Between January and March, the economy grew by 0.7% the Office for National Statistics (ONS) said.

Figures released last month initially estimated growth had been 0.6%.

The strength of the economy has been a central battleground in the general election campaign, with growth having been sluggish in recent years.

Most economists, politicians and businesses want to see GDP rising steadily, because it usually means people are spending more, extra jobs are created, more tax is paid to the government and workers get better pay rises.

The original figure for the first quarter of the year was stronger than economists had expected, and growth in the services sector, which includes businesses such as hairdressers, banks, and hospitality, helped to push it higher, the ONS said.

But while services growth was revised upwards, increases in manufacturing were revised down on the back of more data being collected.

Due to the upward revision, the UK was the fastest growing economy in the G7 group of countries with advanced economies in the first three months of this year.

Prime Minister and Conservative leader Rishi Sunak hailed the new revised growth and said his party had a ""clear plan to deliver a more secure future for your family"".

But Labour accused the Conservatives of ""14 years economic vandalism"", which it said had left people worse off.

""A Labour government will grow the economy and show Britain is open for business with a plan for growth, so that we can put money back in people’s pockets,"" said a spokesperson.

Sarah Olney, Liberal Democrat Treasury spokesperson, said despite the upward revision, the figures would ""come as cold comfort for families being hammered by spiralling mortgage repayments, unfair stealth taxes and the cost of a weekly food shop going through the roof"".","UK economy grew more than estimated in early 2024The economy grew by more than initially estimated in the first three months of 2024 as the UK emerged from recession, revised official figures show.

4 days ago By Mark Palmer , BBC News Share

Getty Images The company had originally planned to shut down one of the blast furnaces by the end of June and the second by September

Workers at Tata Steel have been told the company is taking steps to potentially cease operations at much of the Port Talbot plant by 7 July because of a strike by the trade union Unite. The company had originally been planning to shut one of the blast furnaces by the end of June and the second one by September. But Port Talbot workers have been told that because of the strike from 8 July, the company can no longer be assured of sufficient resources being available to ensure safe and stable operations. The Unite union said Tata's statement to shut or pause the blast furnaces three months earlier than intended was the latest in a long line of threats and it would not deter them. The Welsh government said it cannot and will not support the closure of both blast furnaces.

Last week the Unite union announced that about 1,500 workers would begin an indefinite strike on 8 July over the company's plans to cut thousands of jobs. Onay Kasab, the national lead for Unite, told Radio Wales Breakfast that the union was due to have a conversation with the company regarding safety during the strike. Mr Kasab denied if the union had given the company an opportunity to shut the site. ""What other option have we got when we are facing 2,800 job losses. We have said to Tata, again and again, 'wait for a general election, wait for a new Labour government'"" he said. Mr Kasab said the union have a letter from the company asking the union to wait until after the general election for discussions to take place. However, the company previously said it would not be changing course in Port Talbot, regardless of who wins the general election. About 2,800 Tata Steel workers will lose their jobs when the company closes both blast furnaces in Port Talbot by the end of September. At the time, the company said if the strike affected the safety or stability of its operations it would be ""forced"" to accelerate closure plans. A spokesperson for Tata said: ""Following the announcement by Unite union to unilaterally call strike action from 8 July, Tata Steel is unfortunately forced to commence legal action to challenge the validity of Unite's ballot. ""In the coming days, if we cannot be certain that we are able to continue to safely and stably operate our assets through the period of strike action, we will not have any choice but to pause or stop heavy end operations [including both blast furnaces] on the Port Talbot site. ""That is not a decision we would take lightly, and we recognise that it would prove extremely costly and disruptive throughout the supply chain, but the safety of people on or around our sites will always take priority over everything else."" Tata said it is again calling on Unite to withdraw its industrial action and join Community and GMB unions in ""giving consideration"" to the company's proposal, which Tata said includes ""generous employee support packages, training and skills development"". It said it ""understands"" the impact the restructuring will have on many employees and contractors, but that it ""remains committed to a just transition"" and hopes for a ""long and sustainable future"" in the UK. The company plans to build a £1.25bn electric arc furnace to produce steel in a way which is less polluting than traditional blast furnaces but requires fewer workers. Tata said the move would secure the future of steelmaking at the site and the UK government is contributing £500m towards the cost of the project. The plans for the site will see both furnaces shut down. Number five will go off by the end of next week as planned while four is due to go off by the end of September. Preparatory work to shut down five will begin by 1 July if the strike goes ahead. Other elements that will close include the harbour, sinter plant, ore yards and primary steelmaking.

PA Media Unite union workers are protesting against Tata Steel's plans to cut 2,800 jobs

Sharon Graham, the Unite general secretary, said the union is ""fighting for the future of the steel industry"". She said Unite has secured ""serious investment"" from Labour to safeguard jobs. ""Tata putting out a statement to shut or pause its blast furnaces three months earlier than they intended to is the latest in a long line of threats that won't deter us. ""The Unite campaign is not about selling jobs, it's about securing the long-term future of steel making in this country for thousands of workers in Port Talbot and South Wales."" Unite said it is calling on the ""real decision makers"" in Mumbai to realise that ""the investment secured will be good for the company and workers."" GMB union said Tata must ""step back"" from this ""irreversible decision"" and instead ""safeguard steelmaking assets"". GMB national officer, Charlotte Brumpton-Childs, said that the upcoming general election could ""change so much"", and that GMB's next actions would be decided by its members. The Community union condemned Tata's ""unacceptable"" decision to bring forward the closure and said it continued to support the Labour Party's call for Tata not to make irreversible decisions before the general election.

Analysis by Ben Price, BBC Wales News

Developments have escalated quickly in the past two weeks. Unite is one of three unions which represents steelworkers and it has so far been the most militant in its action in the face of significant job cuts across Tata’s UK operations. Members are currently working to rule and there’s a ban on any overtime. However, the decision to walk out indefinitely is an escalation which now potentially threatens the early closure of the UK’s largest steelmaking operation in Port Talbot. Tata says it would have no option but to close if the strike goes ahead, but in the meantime the company has filed for an injunction at the High Court to try to prevent the strike happening. It suggests Unite’s ballot on industrial action wasn’t carried out properly. With the action due on 8 July, Tata will need a ruling quickly. The other unions, Community and GMB, say they’ll wait until after the general election before deciding whether to strike too. But having spoken to a number of steelworkers in Port Talbot, the sense is that many don’t want a strike which could cost them the current offer on the table from the company. What happens during the course of the next week could be crucial to the future of thousands of livelihoods, although Tata says no redundancies will be made until the end of September, regardless.

Workers and local people have protested about the closure plans

First Minister Vaughan Gething described the news from Tata as ""extraordinary"" and urged the company to wait for the result of next week's general election. In a statement, Mr Gething said: ""The news that Tata could switch off blast furnaces four and five at Port Talbot next week is extraordinary and will cause huge anxiety for the workforce, their families and the community. ""The Welsh government cannot and will not support the closure of both blast furnaces"". He added that acting whilst the nation went to the polls did not help de-escalate matters. Samuel Kurtz, the Welsh Conservative shadow minister for economy and energy,said it was ""disappointing news that will cause additional distress to communities already dealing with enough as it is"". ""Tata have shown no goodwill to their workforce at what is an anxious time. “The Welsh Labour government have also only paid lip service to Tata's workforce, failing to contribute a penny to the transition board, and UK Labour's manifesto says nothing on what it would do differently to support Port Talbot's steelworkers,"" he added. Luke Fletcher, Plaid Cymru's economy spokesperson, said steel should be brought under the control of the next UK government, which Plaid believes will be led by Sir Keir Starmer. Mr Fletcher said: ""The time has come now for an incoming Labour government to put words into action on steel. ""Save our steel is no good as just a slogan, if we are going to save our steel, nationalisation needs to happen on day one.""","The Welsh government said it cannot and will not support the closure of both blast furnaces.

4 days ago Share

Getty Images Aer Lingus have now cancelled almost 400 flights

Aer Lingus has confirmed it is cancelling a further 122 flights up until 7 July due to the ongoing industrial action by pilots. The airline has now cancelled almost 400 flights as a result of an indefinite work-to-rule and strike action by pilots. The work-to-rule means not working over time or carrying out any other out-of-hours duties. An eight-hour strike from 05:00 -13:00 local time is planned for Saturday. Aer Lingus said that due to the “indefinite nature” of Irish Air Line Pilots' Association pilots’ industrial action it “must cancel” additional flights up to 7 July.

RTE Dublin Airport on the first day of industrial action

Irish broadcaster RTÉ had reported that the recommendation for an additional strike was made by IALPA on Thursday. However, on Friday afternoon, Capt Mark Tighe, president of the union, said that Ireland's Labour Court has invited both parties in the dispute to return to them on Monday afternoon. ""We are in the process of discussing that and that of course would have relevance to whether or not we escalate the industrial action,"" he told Radio Ulster's Evening Extra programme. ""I’m hoping now that they have noted the seriousness of the situation and that they’ll be able to apply their considerable expertise."" Talks between it and Aer Lingus to resolve the ongoing pay dispute broke down without a resolution on Thursday.

School pupils 'slept on floor'

A group of students and teachers from Shimna Integrated School in County Down who were retuning from a trip to Berlin had their flight home cancelled while they were in the airport. Teacher Luke McWatters, said that their 21:45 flight on Thursday was initially showing as delayed and then, more than two hours after the flight was initially due to take off, they were told it was cancelled. “Trying to ring through to Aer Lingus I was on three different calls to three different agents who, every time I got to a certain way through said: ‘Because you’re a group we can’t do anything for you -you have to contact group Aer Lingus who don’t open until 9am’.” Mr McWatters told the BBC’s Evening Extra programme that he felt they had been “left high and dry”, with no offer of accommodation or food.

Luke McWatters Luke McWatters said support from the airline ""fell short"" of what was expected

He said the group slept on the airport floor. Mr McWatters said they were offered an alternative flight on 1 July. “At that stage we made the call to try other airlines and split ourselves up as a group,” he added. Half of the group travelled to Edinburgh, while the other half caught a flight to Poland, with both groups booked on flights back to Ireland on Friday. Mr McWatters said that the support for Aer Lingus had “fallen very short of what you would expect from a major airline dealing with children”. The BBC has contacted Aer Lingus for a response.

'Reasonable pay claim'

Capt Tighe said ""passengers are extremely dear to us as pilots. Management don’t meet you, we do every day. ""We’ve been left in a position where our pay is being eroded and all we’re looking to do is maintain our pay."" Speaking to BBC News NI's Good Morning Ulster programme on Friday, Capt Tighe said in an effort to resolve the dispute, the union had said it would accept less than an inflationary rise. ""We don’t believe anybody should be getting less than inflation, but yesterday in an effort to resolve this, we said we would accept less than inflation."" However, he added: ""We believe inflation is a very reasonable claim in this current time.""

PA Media IALPA President Capt Mark Tighe said the Labour Court has invited both sides to further discussions on Monday

Additional strike action?

IALPA had recommended to trade union Fórsa that the additional strike should be longer than the action planned for Saturday, RTÉ has reported. If sanctioned, Fórsa will have to give seven days’ notice to Aer Lingus before pilots can stop work. Aer Lingus has described the potential of further strike action as ""entirely inappropriate given the request of the Labour Court this week that the dispute should not be escalated"". Donal Moriarty, Aer Lingus' chief corporate affairs officer, said the airline is ""willing to go back to the Labour Court on a formal joint referral basis"". He said Aer Lingus has encouraged IALPA and Fórsa to ""agree to this step"".

4 days ago By Tom Espiner , BBC business reporter Share

BBC

Former Fujitsu engineer and Horizon expert Gareth Jenkins has said he didn't think the software was ""a monster"" and that he was ""trapped into doing things I shouldn't have done"". Speaking at an inquiry into the Horizon scandal, Mr Jenkins was accused by lawyer Flora Page of ""protecting"" it when he gave evidence as an expert witness between 2010 and 2013. Ms Page represents Horizon victims including former sub-postmaster Seema Misra, who Mr Jenkins gave evidence against in 2010. Ms Misra told the BBC the system was a monster which ""had blood on its hands, and so do the people who protect [it]"".

Between 1999 and 2015, the Post Office prosecuted hundreds of sub-postmasters on the strength of faulty Horizon data, with 700 convicted of offences such as theft and false accounting. Horizon falsely flagged discrepancies in accounts, with many sub-postmasters using their own savings to make good the imaginary shortfalls. The wrongful prosecutions, which have been called one of the biggest British miscarriages of justice, had a devastating effect on the lives of the sub-postmasters affected. They faced financial ruin and the loss of standing in their communities. Some sub-postmasters ended up taking their own lives after being pursued by the Post Office for supposed losses, including Martin Griffiths, whose widow was later paid in instalments by the Post Office for her silence, the inquiry heard in April.

Giving his fourth day of evidence at the inquiry into the Horizon scandal, Mr Jenkins was questioned by Ms Page, a barrister who represented Horizon victims including Seema Misra. Ms Misra was pregnant with her second child when she was convicted of theft and sent to jail in 2010. She later told the BBC she would have killed herself had she not been pregnant at the time. In a charged atmosphere at the hearing, with Ms Misra sitting next to her, Ms Page accused Mr Jenkins of being a ""Fujitsu man"". She said Mr Jenkins ""knew the Misra trial was a test case for Horizon"". Ms Page alleged his role was to make sure Horizon had a ""clean bill of health"" and that he had ""tailored"" his evidence accordingly. ""My role was to tell the truth,"" Mr Jenkins said. ""I attempted to answer as best I could the questions I was asked"". Ms Page responded: ""Never mind whether a by-product of protecting the monster was that a woman was sent to jail"". Mr Jenkins said he was ""sorry for had happened to Mrs Misra"" but he felt that was down the to way that the Post Office had behaved and wasn't ""purely down to me"". ""I clearly got trapped into doing things I shouldn't have done, but that was not intentional on my behalf,"" he said.

Mr Jenkins was part of the Fujitsu team that developed the Horizon software, and part of his role was dealing with bugs in the system. Mr Jenkins has maintained throughout his evidence that he didn't understand his previous duties as an expert witness to tell the court about problems with Horizon, and that he didn't know that he shouldn't just narrowly answer questions about the technology. Under questioning at the inquiry on Friday, Mr Jenkins said: ""I appreciate that I got things very wrong, but it was done through ignorance rather than maliciousness"". He added that the Horizon system ""as a whole was working well"". Mr Jenkins is currently being investigated by the Metropolitan Police on suspicion of perjury - lying to a court, and perverting the course of justice. No criminal charges have been brought.","Fujitsu expert: I didn't think Horizon was a monster4 days ago By Tom Espiner , BBC business reporter ShareBBCFormer Fujitsu engineer and Horizon expert Gareth Jenkins has said he didn't think the software was ""a monster"" and that he was ""trapped into doing things I shouldn't have done"".

Thousands of UK bank customers were hit by payment problems affecting some of the biggest High Street lenders on Friday.

Banks including HSBC, Nationwide, Barclays and Virgin Money were all affected by issues with a system that operates payments between individuals and firms.

The group overseeing the payments system said the issue causing the problems has now been fixed, and the payment backlog has been cleared.

However, several people have told the BBC they are still facing issues, with some saying they now have little cash left.

The timing of the glitches was particularly problematic given the last Friday of the month is when many salaried staff are usually paid.

Many people also have to pay bills around this time.

""My bills are bouncing and I can’t pay for a train ticket I need in the next hour,"" said one customer on X.

Another said customers deserved compensation for the ""inconvenience on people’s pay day"".

""We all have bills to pay,"" they added.

Ryan, from Telford, who did not want his surname to be used, said he had not received his wages and as a result has £12 to his name.

The 29-year-old engineer said bills had started to be declined on his account.

""I’m supposed to be moving home next week and my savings have been emptied for deposits and rent,"" he said.

The BBC understands that the banks were affected by issues to Faster Payments, a system that operates ""under the bonnet"" of the UK financial system.

It aims to make sure real-time payments between millions of individuals and businesses are made seemingly instantly.

Pay UK, which oversees the system, said: ""We are aware that a small number of Faster Payments were delayed or not processed earlier today.

""Working with our infrastructure provider, this technical issue has been fixed.""

It then added later that ""payments have returned to normal and the backlog is resolved"".

However, some banking customers have disputed this, telling the BBC they have still yet to receive their salary payments.

HSBC, Nationwide, Barclays and Virgin Media had all apologised earlier for the delays to payments.

This is not the first time High Street lenders' services have been hit by problems.

Nationwide customers faced similar issues in March, while HSBC customers suffered an outage lasting over 24 hours in November.","Major UK high street banks say payment issues fixedThousands of UK bank customers were hit by payment problems affecting some of the biggest High Street lenders on Friday.

Nike shares plunged more than 12% in after hours trading

Nike has said it expects a surprise 10% drop in quarterly revenue, as it faces growing competition from newer rivals such as On and Hoka.

The news sent Nike shares plunging more than 12% in after hours trading, which could mean a loss of $15bn in market value if the losses hold on Friday.

The world's largest sportswear company also told investors it is facing weakening demand in international markets, including in China.

But Nike is optimistic that new products and a marketing campaign at the upcoming Olympic Games in Paris will help the company regain momentum with consumers.

""The Paris Olympics offers us a pinnacle moment to communicate our vision of sport to the world,"" CEO John Donahoe said on the earnings call.

The company also lowered its outlook for the 2025 fiscal year.

It said direct-to-consumer business declined 8%, as some customers went for more trendy upstart brands.

""There's a sense that Nike just hasn't innovated enough, it hasn't marketed enough, it hasn't told enough stories around its products,"" the Managing director of GlobalData Retail, Neil Saunders, told the BBC.

The sportswear giant's strategy to sell its products through its own stores and website instead of wholesales like Foot Locker hurt sales, Reuters said.

""Nike needs to get on the front foot again in terms of persuading people to buy its products,"" Mr Saunders added.

Nike is currently the top sponsor of jerseys at the UEFA Euro 2024 football tournament, beating out brands like Adidas and Puma.

Getty Images Amazon had to defend the use of AI technology in its physical grocery stores

Amazon received critical headlines this year when reports questioned the “Just Walk Out” technology installed at many of its physical grocery stores. The AI-powered system enables customers at many of its Amazon Fresh and Amazon Go shops to simply pick their items, and then leave. The AI uses lots of sensors to work out what you have chosen. You then get automatically billed. However, back in April it was widely reported that rather than solely using AI, Just Walk Out needed around 1,000 workers in India to manually check almost three quarters of the transactions.

Amazon was quick to claim that the reports were “erroneous”, and that staff in India were not reviewing video footage from all the shops. Instead it said that the Indian workers were simply reviewing the system. Amazon added that “this is no different than any other AI system that places a high value on accuracy, where human reviewers are common”. Whatever the exact details of the Amazon case, it is a high-profile example of a new and growing question – whether companies are making over-inflated claims about their use of AI. It is a phenomenon that has been dubbed “AI washing” in reference to the environmental ""green washing"".

But first, a reminder of what exactly AI means. While there is no exact definition, AI allows computers to learn and solve problems. AI is able to do this after first being trained on huge amounts of information. The specific type of AI that has made all the headlines over the past few years is so-called ""generative AI"". This is AI that specialises in creating new content, be it having text conversations, or producing music or images. Chatbots like ChatGPT, Google's Gemini, and Microsoft's Copilot are popular examples of generative AI. When it comes to AI washing, there are several types. Some companies claim to use AI when they're actually using less-sophisticated computing, while others overstate the efficacy of their AI over existing techniques, or suggest that their AI solutions are fully operational when they are not. Meanwhile, other firms are simply bolting an AI chatbot onto their existing non-AI operating software. While only 10% of tech start-ups mentioned using AI in their pitches in 2022, this rose to more than a quarter in 2023, according to OpenOcean, a UK and Finland-based investment fund for new tech firms. It expects that figure to be more than a third this year. And, says OpenOcean team member Sri Ayangar, competition for funding and the desire to appear on the cutting edge have pushed some such companies to overstate their AI capabilities. ""Some founders seem to believe that if they don’t mention AI in their pitch, this may put them at a disadvantage, regardless of the role it plays in their solution,"" says Mr Ayangar. ""And from our analysis, a significant disparity exists between companies claiming AI capabilities, and those demonstrating tangible AI-driven results.""

Sri Ayangar Sri Ayangar says that some start-up bosses feel they just have to mention AI

It is a problem that has quietly existed for a number of years, according to data from another tech investment firm, MMC Ventures. In a 2019 study it found that 40% of new tech firms that described themselves as ""AI start-ups"" in fact used virtually no AI at all. ""The problem is the same today, plus a different problem,"" says Simon Menashy, general partner at MMC Ventures. He explains that ""cutting-edge AI capabilities"" are now available for every company to buy for the price of standard software. But that instead of building a whole AI system, he says many firms are simply popping a chatbot interface on top of a non-AI product.

Douglas Dick, UK head of emerging technology risk at accountancy giant KPMG, says the problem of AI washing is not helped by the fact there not a single agreed definition of AI. ""If I asked a room of people what their definition of AI is, they would all give a different answer,” he says. “The term is used very broadly and loosely, without any clear point of reference. It is this ambiguity that is allowing AI washing to emerge. ""AI washing can have concerning impacts for businesses, from overpaying for technology and services to failing to meet operational objectives the AI was expected to help them achieve."" Meanwhile, for investors it can make it harder to identify genuinely innovative companies. And, says Mr Ayangar: ""If consumers have unmet expectations from products that claim to offer advanced AI-driven solutions, this can erode trust in start-ups that are doing genuinely ground-breaking work.""

Regulators, in the US at least, are starting to take notice. Earlier this year, the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) said it was charging two investment advisory firms with making false and misleading statements about the extent of their use of AI. ""The firm stance taken by the SEC demonstrates a lack of leeway when it comes to AI washing, indicating that, at least in the US, we can expect more fines and sanctions down the line for those who violate the regulations,"" says Nick White, partner at international law firm Charles Russell Speechlys.

Nick White Nick White says that it is good to see US regulators clamping down on the problem","What is 'AI washing' and why is it a problem?
