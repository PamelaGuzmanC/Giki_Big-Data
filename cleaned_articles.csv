CNBC,https://www.cnbc.com/2024/07/01/salesforce-shareholders-vote-against-compensation-for-top-executives.html,2024-07-02,00:47:11 UTC,"Salesforce shareholders reject compensation plan for CEO Marc Benioff, other top execs","Salesforce investors voted against the company's compensation plan for top executives, after shareholder advisory groups raised concerns about equity awards granted to CEO Marc Benioff.

According to a regulatory filing on Monday, the resolution to approve the compensation received 339.3 million votes in favor and 404.8 million against at the annual meeting held on Thursday.

The board had urged shareholders to vote in favor of the resolution. But two shareholder advisory firms, Glass Lewis and Institutional Shareholder Services, both recommended that investors vote down the measure.

For the 2024 fiscal year, Benioff received $39.6 million in total pay, up from $29.9 million in the prior year. While Benioff's salary was flat at $1.55 million, he received additional stock and option awards and nonequity incentive plan compensation, according to the proxy statement. The most recent sum also included security fees that had not previously been invoiced to the company.

In January, the board's compensation committee gave Benioff a second long-term equity award worth $20 million, in recognition of the company's ""successful transformation actions and strong financial performance in the fiscal year,"" among other factors.

Glass Lewis wrote in its recommendation that ""shareholders may reasonably be wary of the substantial discretionary equity grants"" issued to Benioff in January, adding that there was a ""lack of a fully convincing rationale"" behind the grants.

Benioff was already among the largest holders of Salesforce, with a stake of over 2% valued at close to $6 billion. Glass Lewis said in its proxy paper that the additional performance-based restricted stock units and stock options were ""unwarranted"" because his interests were already aligned with that of shareholders.

The vote from the annual meeting is nonbinding.

""Our Compensation Committee, which is responsible for designing and administering our executive compensation program, values the opinions expressed by our stockholders and will consider the outcome of this vote when making future executive compensation decisions,"" Salesforce's board said in the company's proxy statement.

The company declined to comment.

Salesforce shares rose 67% in the 2024 fiscal year ended Jan. 31, the strongest performance since 2011.

Net income jumped to $4.1 billion in the fiscal year from $208 million a year earlier, while revenue increased 11% to $34.9 billion from $31.4 billion. In January 2023, Salesforce announced plans to lay off 10% of employees, after activist investors began buying up stakes and demanding a better mix of profit and growth. Salesforce said in February it would begin paying a dividend to shareholders.

Salesforce shares are off 2.6% year to date.","Salesforce investors voted against the company's compensation plan for top executives, after shareholder advisory groups raised concerns about equity awards granted to CEO Marc Benioff.

Top heavy : Stocks were on pace for a higher close Monday in what has been a volatile session for both equities and bonds. The 10-year Treasury yield was once again nearing 4.5%. Picking up where the second quarter left off, the mega tech stocks continued doing the heavy lifting for the S & P 500 , with Club names Apple up more than 2.5%, Amazon up over 2%, and Microsoft up roughly 1.5%. The average stock, however, was having a rougher time, as indicated by the S & P 500 Equal Weight index , which was down nearly 1% on the session. Monday was the start of the third quarter on Wall Street, with hopes for the kind of strength the market saw in the first half of 2024. Downgrade : We're dropping Estee Lauder to our 2 rating from a buy-equivalent 1 rating and lowering our price target to $140 per share from $162. That PT is slightly below the current consensus of $148, following a string of negative data points toward the end of last week. First, it was the Nike earnings call, which was downbeat on China. Management said its quarterly results fell below plan there when excluding a timing benefit. Nike lowered its outlook for Greater China — pointing to a highly promotional environment. Then there was a negative update last Friday from L'Oreal CEO Nicolas Hieronimus at a JPMorgan investor event. Globally, the CEO said the beauty market is growing somewhere between 4.5% to 5%, which is slightly lower than previous expectations. The key reason behind the sluggishness is the lack of growth in China's beauty market, which Hieronimus called ""quite gloomy right now"" with the rebound not materializing. EL YTD mountain Estee Lauder YTD You could argue points: (1) that a lot of this downside could already be priced into Estee Lauder stock down at these low levels and (2) that it is a special situation since the company has said it has moved past its inventory glut and has a profit recovery plan in place to improve margins. We previously thought these two factors would be sufficient for the stock to find its footing. But disappointingly, it has not materialized as expected. If the latest signs point to a Chinese market that is still struggling to recover, then we need to hold off from adding until we see more evidence of this turnaround taking shape. Up next : There are no major earnings reports Monday after the close. But it is jobs week, and the deluge of data kicks off with the government's Job Openings and Labor Turnover Survey (JOLTS) on Tuesday and finishes with the Labor Department's monthly employment report on Friday.

CNBC,https://www.cnbc.com/2024/07/01/inside-starbucks-plans-to-improve-stores.html,2024-07-01,21:19:38 UTC,Inside Starbucks' plans to improve stores for customers and baristas,"watch now

Starbucks cafes across the country are starting to change how they make drink orders, among other tweaks designed to reduce bottlenecks and long wait times that have dogged the chain. The overhaul comes as the coffee giant prepares for an anticipated swell of orders through its mobile app. At the heart of the plan is Starbucks' ""Siren Craft System,"" a series of processes that are aimed at making baristas' jobs easier and speeding up service times for customers. Starbucks said more than 10% of its 10,000 stores have already implemented the system, which includes changing the production order for hot and cold drinks. It will be in use across North America by the end of July, according to the company. Executives hope the changes will provide a much-needed jolt to Starbucks. In April, the company reported a disappointing second quarter, as U.S. same-store sales fell 3% and traffic dropped 7%. The coffee chain cut its 2024 outlook. Starbucks reported rates of incomplete mobile app orders in the mid-teens and said occasional customers came in less. CEO Laxman Narasimhan mentioned the need to make improvements to stores. Katie Young, senior vice president of store operations at Starbucks, said the most immediate shift that needed to happen in cafes was better handling the unexpected. ""It's the ability to flexibly respond to things we cannot predict,"" she told CNBC in an interview.

The store changes will be key this month, as Starbucks on Monday started opening up its app to non-rewards members, which the company believes will increase traffic and orders. Analyst Peter Saleh, managing director at BTIG, said, ""My sense is that they have a lot of demand in certain stores, and the footprint of the kitchen is so small, you have to find ways to be more efficient."" Losing customers because of slow orders and other store frustrations could cost Starbucks at a particularly vulnerable time. Americans have become cost conscious in the face of ongoing inflation, and in some cases have pulled back on morning or afternoon beverages and snacks. Narasimhan in April said consumers are spending more cautiously. Starbucks has done something uncharacteristic in recent weeks, joining the stream of value offerings with a $5 food and beverage combo option. Communicating value to customers is also part of the plan to drum up business.

The Siren system

Starbucks has been diagnosing the bottleneck issue for more than a year, since the company's reinvention plan rollout in 2022, said Young. At the time, Howard Schultz was at the helm, having returned during a burgeoning unionization movement and shifts in consumer preferences. The changes underway in cafes were first previewed that fall, to be rolled out in the years to come. Narasimhan took over for Schultz in March 2023. The Siren system processes were developed with worker feedback on which issues stopped them from creating beverages and connecting with customers. Starbucks said it plans to add a role akin to an expediter in a restaurant production line, a ""play caller"" who steps away from production and helps solve logjams in cafes, handling tasks such as restocking cups or helping when an unexpected crowd arrives. The company plans to train existing workers for the role or potentially add new baristas, if needed. ""One of the pain points we saw was [that] our espresso machine was often running all the time, and that was one of the things that kept our partners from being able to check in. And another thing we saw that you didn't necessarily know was which part of the store would get crowded,"" Young said. ""We needed to actually have a partner that was dedicated when things got busy to pulling out of production and just helping."" Starbucks said it will also change the order in which beverages are made. Previously, cold drinks were prioritized from start to finish, even if a hot beverage order came in first, as pulling espresso shots was the last step. This could create a traffic jam in the drive-thru, for example, if a person ordered one of each beverage, as the cold item would be ready while the hot drink was still in production. Macoy McLaughlin, manager of Seattle's First and Walker Starbucks location, said producing beverages in the order they were placed allows for a faster, streamlined process. ""We actually have proper sequencing between our hot and cold bars, versus cold bars becoming as popular as ever, to really have a consistent experience for the customers. So we're actually making them in the order they're coming in,"" McLaughlin said, adding that the cafe feels busier, but customers in store and in the drive-thru are getting drinks faster. Baristas also will have more control over the company's digital production manager, an iPad system that controls the sequencing of orders in various channels from cafes, mobile orders and the drive-thru, the company said. Workers will have more flexibility over changing order priority.

A bitcoin exchange that collapsed 10 years ago after being hacked is set to return billions of dollars' worth of the token to users — and it has investors worried. In a few days, bankrupt Tokyo-based bitcoin exchange Mt. Gox will begin paying back thousands of users almost $9 billion worth of tokens. The platform went under in 2014 following a series of heists that cost it in the range of 650,000 to 950,000 bitcoins, or upward of $59 billion, at current prices. The payout follows a protracted bankruptcy process that's involved multiple delays and legal challenges. On Monday, the court-appointed trustee overseeing the exchange's bankruptcy proceedings said distributions to the firm's roughly 20,000 creditors would begin in early July. Disbursements will be in a mix of bitcoin and bitcoin cash, an early offshoot of the original cryptocurrency. While this is good news for victims of the hack who have spent years waiting to be made whole, the price of bitcoin slid to $59,000 last week, in the crypto market's second-worst weekly decline of the year.

CNBC spoke to half a dozen analysts to get their take on what to expect when roughly 141,000 bitcoins — or roughly 0.7% of the total 19.7 million bitcoins outstanding — are returned to Mt. Gox victims this week.

Pressure on bitcoin could pick up

Mt. Gox — short for ""Magic: The Gathering Online Exchange"" — was once the largest spot bitcoin exchange globally, claiming to handle around 80% of all global dollar trades for bitcoin. When it shuttered in February 2014, bitcoin was worth around $600. As of Monday, the world's largest cryptocurrency is trading at about $62,000 per coin. That means users opting to be reimbursed in kind — that is, in the cryptocurrency itself, rather than the cash equivalent — have seen the value of their coins surge more than 10,000% in the last decade. John Glover, chief investment officer of crypto lending firm Ledn, told CNBC the windfall for Mt. Gox users would likely translate to huge sales in bitcoin as investors look to lock in gains. ""Many will clearly cash out and enjoy the fact that having their assets stuck in the Mt. Gox bankruptcy was the best investment they ever made,"" said Glover, who was previously a managing director at Barclays. ""Some will clearly choose to take the money and run,"" added Glover. James Butterfill, head of research at CoinShares, told CNBC the overhang of the nearly $9 billion of bitcoin set to be released has ""long been a concern for those with bullish views on bitcoin."" ""Consequently, the market is highly sensitive to any related news. With the announcement that the Trust will begin selling in July, investors are understandably worried,"" said Butterfill.

It wouldn't be the first time bitcoin's moved in reaction to big redemptions of funds locked up in centralized trading platforms. Last month, crypto exchange Gemini returned more than $2 billion worth of bitcoin to users with funds that had been trapped in its Earn lending program, marking a 230% recovery after bitcoin prices more than tripled since Gemini suspended Earn withdrawals on Nov. 16. JPMorgan analysts linked this to negative price action, saying in a research note last week that it's ""fair to assume that some of Gemini creditors, which are mostly retail customers, have taken at least partial profits in recent weeks."" The analysts expect Mt. Gox customers to be similarly inclined to sell some of their bitcoin to profit from seismic gains for the cryptocurrency. ""Assuming most of the liquidations by Mt. Gox creditors take place in July, [this] creates a trajectory where crypto prices come under further pressure in July, but start rebounding from August onwards,"" they wrote. Separately last month, the German government sold 5,000 — worth approximately $310 million as of Monday's prices — of a 50,000-bitcoin pile seized in connection with the movie piracy operation Movi2k. The funds were sent to various crypto exchanges, including Coinbase, Kraken and Bitstamp, according to blockchain intelligence firm Arkham Intelligence. Analysts say these crypto liquidations, too, have placed pressure on bitcoin's price.

Mt. Gox customers expected to hang on to their bitcoin

Most analysts agree losses in bitcoin are likely to be contained and short-lived. ""I think that sell-off concerns relating to Mt. Gox will likely be short term,"" said Lennix Lai, chief commercial officer of crypto exchange OKX. ""Many of Mt. Gox's early users as well as creditors are long-term bitcoin enthusiasts who are less likely to sell all of their bitcoin immediately,"" he said, adding previous sell-offs by law enforcement, including the Silk Road case, did not result in a sustained catastrophic price drop. Butterfill suggested there's enough market liquidity to cushion the blow of any possible mass market sell action. ""Bitcoin has maintained a daily trading volume of $8.74 billion on trusted exchanges this year, suggesting that liquidity is sufficient to absorb these sales over the summer months,"" said Butterfill. According to CCData research analyst Jacob Joseph, the markets are more than capable of absorbing the selling pressure. ""Moreover, a healthy part of the creditors are likely to take a 10% haircut on their holdings to receive the repayment early, and not all holdings are set to be liquidated on the open market, reducing the overall selling pressure,"" he said.

Recent price moves suggest the temporary impact of the Mt. Gox repayments may already be priced in, Joseph added. Galaxy Digital's head of research, Alex Thorn, believes fewer coins will be distributed than people think, meaning there will be less sell pressure than the market expects. However, he also wrote in May that, even if only 10% of the bitcoin distributed is sold, ""it will have a market impact."" ""Most of the individual creditors will have their coins deposited directly into a trading account at an exchange, making it extremely easy to sell,"" Thorn said. Vijay Ayyar, head of consumer growth for Asia-Pacific at crypto exchange Gemini, said that the overall impact of the Mt. Gox disbursement is likely to be ""dissipated,"" given the recipients of the funds are varied. On the one hand, there are individual holders who will get their bitcoin straight away. Then there's the ""significant amount"" of bitcoin that will be disbursed out to claims funds, Ayyar said. ""Those funds would then need to distribute these out to their LPs [limited partners], hence the whole process could take a while adding a time element to the impact on price,"" he told CNBC.

Macro headwinds behind bitcoin's fall

It's worth noting there are plenty of other reasons behind bitcoin's recent declines. The cryptocurrency had a stunning rally earlier this year, climbing past $70,000 on the heels of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission's approval of the first spot bitcoin ETF.

Stock Chart Icon Stock chart icon Bitcoin's U.S. dollar price performance, year-to-date.

But investors have remained anxious amid outflows from bitcoin ETFs and sizable market liquidations. The broader macro environment, too, has investors worried. Earlier this month, the Federal Reserve suggested it plans to cut rates just once this year, down from the multiple reductions it had indicated previously. Cryptocurrencies, which are inherently volatile, are particularly sensitive to changes in the interest rate environment. CoinShares' Butterfill said the Fed's new rate forecast was among ""the likely culprits for the recent price decline"" in bitcoin. This, along with other issues, is ""likely to weigh on prices in the lower volume summer months,"" Butterfill said. However, ""the fundamental investment case remains very much intact,"" he added.","In a few days, bankrupt Tokyo-based bitcoin exchange Mt.

CNBC,https://www.cnbc.com/2024/07/01/chewy-shares-rally-20percent-after-sec-filing-reveals-roaring-kitty-keith-gill-has-6point6percent-stake.html,2024-07-01,20:12:41 UTC,Chewy shares fall nearly 7% as the boost from Roaring Kitty's new stake diminishes,"The filing showed Roaring Kitty, whose legal name is Keith Gill, bought just over 9 million shares — amounting to a 6.6% stake in the company. That makes him the third-biggest Chewy shareholder, according to FactSet. Based on Friday's close, that stake is valued at more than $245 million.

The rally in Chewy shares lost steam Monday as traders reacted to a Securities and Exchange Commission filing that showed meme stock trader ""Roaring Kitty"" took a stake in the pet food e-commerce retailer.

The SEC filing also included a section that read: ""Check the appropriate box to designate whether you are a cat."" There was an ""x"" next to a response that read: ""I am not a cat."" This line was included in Gill's statement in a series of congressional hearings about 2021's GameStop trading mania.

The stock rallied more than 9% on Monday, but it quickly fell into negative territory in morning trading. Shares ended the day down 6.6%.

Chewy shares took a wild ride last week after Gill posted a picture on social media platform X of a cartoon dog that resembled Chewy's logo. The shares were up as much as 34% on Thursday but ended the day down slightly.

CNBC emailed Chewy's public relations team seeking comment on the new shareholder.

Gill is known to be a champion of GameStop and has been stirring up trading in the video game company in the last few months. In mid-June, he disclosed a stake of 9.001 million GameStop shares after exiting his massive call options position. It's unclear if he sold his GameStop bet to fund the purchase of Chewy.

GameStop shares fell more than 5% following the news.



There's a big connection between GameStop and Chewy. GameStop CEO Ryan Cohen was founder and the first CEO of Chewy, who was instrumental in PetSmart's takeover of Chewy in 2017 and its subsequent initial public offering in 2019.

Cohen joined the GameStop board of directors along with two other Chewy executives in January 2021, partly helping fuel the initial GameStop rally. He later took over as GameStop CEO in 2023, leading a turnaround in the brick-and-mortar video game retailer.

In a recent YouTube livestream, Gill said GameStop is in the second stage of a reinvention, and it has become a bet on Cohen himself, who's also been leading a pivot to e-commerce.

The investor was hit by a new class-action lawsuit filed Friday, alleging he engaged in securities fraud by manipulating GameStop's stock price through his online influence in May and June. The case was voluntarily dismissed on Monday.

Gill is a former marketer for Massachusetts Mutual Life Insurance. He came into the limelight after successfully encouraging retail investors to buy GameStop shares and call options in 2021 to squeeze out short-selling hedge funds.","This line was included in Gill's statement in a series of congressional hearings about 2021's GameStop trading mania.

CNBC,https://www.cnbc.com/2024/07/01/irs-crypto-tax-reporting-guidance.html,2024-07-01,20:39:31 UTC,What the new IRS guidance on crypto tax reporting means for investors,"The U.S. Department of the Treasury and IRS on Friday released final tax reporting rules for digital asset brokers — and crypto investors have limited time to prepare, experts say.

Mandatory yearly reporting will phase in starting in 2026, with digital currency brokers required to cover gross proceeds from sales in 2025 via Form 1099-DA. In 2027, brokers must include cost basis, or purchase price, for certain digital asset sales for 2026.

""These regulations are an important part of the larger effort on high-income individual tax compliance,"" IRS Commissioner Danny Werfel said in a statement. ""We need to make sure digital assets are not used to hide taxable income, and these final regulations will improve detection of noncompliance in the high-risk space of digital assets.""

Boeing said Monday that it will buy back its struggling fuselage maker Spirit AeroSystems in an all-stock deal that the plane maker has said will improve safety and quality control. It said it agreed to pay $37.25 a share in Boeing stock for Spirit, giving the plane supplier an equity value of $4.7 billion. Including Spirit's debt the deal has a transaction value of $8.3 billion Boeing said. Spirit's shares closed Friday at $32.87 a share, a market capitalization of about $3.8 billion. Boeing in March disclosed it was in talks to acquire the Wichita, Kansas-based company, weeks after a fuselage panel blew out midair from a nearly new Boeing 737 Max 9 on an Alaska Airlines flight, sparking a fresh crisis for Boeing. Spirit makes the fuselages for the 737 and other parts, including sections of Boeing's 787 Dreamliners. In 2005, Boeing spun off operations in Kansas and Oklahoma that became the present-day Spirit AeroSystems. Boeing accounted for about 70% of Spirit's revenue last year, while roughly a quarter came from making parts for Boeing's main rival, Airbus, according to a securities filing. Boeing CEO Dave Calhoun, who has said he will step down at the end of the year, on Monday said bringing Spirit in-house will ""fully align"" the companies' production systems and workforces.

""Among the many actions we're taking as a company, this is one of the most significant in demonstrating our unwavering commitment to strengthen quality and make certain that Boeing is the company the world needs it to be,"" Calhoun said in a message to employees. He said he expects the deal to close mid-2025, subject to approval by regulators, Spirit shareholders and the sale of Spirit's operations dedicated to Airbus planes. Spirit's CEO, Pat Shanahan, is considered a possible successor for Calhoun. Airbus, meanwhile, said Monday it has reached an agreement with Spirit so that the European aircraft manufacturer is compensated $559 million by Spirit to acquire its manufacturing lines dedicated to Airbus planes. Those include operations in Belfast, Northern Ireland, where the wings and mid-fuselage of the A220 are produced, A220 pylons in Wichita and A350 fuselage sections in North Carolina. Airbus will pay $1 for the assets.

CNBC,https://www.cnbc.com/2024/07/01/democrats-ask-raimondo-for-more-oversight-on-chips-funding.html,2024-07-01,18:04:18 UTC,Democrats ask Raimondo to step up enforcement on CHIPS funding,"U.S. Secretary of Commerce Gina Raimondo testifies during the House Science, Space and Technology Committee hearing titled ""Chips on the Table: A one year review of the CHIPS and Science Act,"" in the Rayburn Building in Washington, D.C., on Sept. 19, 2023.

WASHINGTON — A group of Democrats are raising concerns as to whether companies that received federal funding for semiconductors used the money to support stock buybacks — and criticizing their own party over how the awards are given.

In a letter to Commerce Secretary Gina Raimondo obtained by CNBC, four lawmakers flagged that BAE Systems commenced a round of buybacks in the same period it will be paid a $35 million award from the CHIPS Act.

The letter, led by Sen. Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts and signed by Reps. Sean Casten and Bill Foster of Illinois and Pramila Jayapal of Washington also noted that Intel, which has received the largest award to date — $8.5 billion — was approved by its board of directors to repurchase $7.24 billion in stocks.

Intel CEO Pat Gelsinger told Yahoo Finance last year that the company remains ""committed to the dividend.""

Raimondo has stated that CHIPS funding is not meant to pad companies' bottom lines or support stock buybacks.

But lawmakers urged her to go further, and ban stock buybacks for companies that receive CHIPS funds.

In the letter, lawmakers wrote that the department has continued to ""leave the door open for these large semiconductor companies to take millions or even billions in CHIPS grants, move some money around, and then engage in more stock buybacks.""

""[I]t is difficult to square the buyback history and stated intentions of the CHIPS awardees with Commerce's indication that it will favor manufacturers that make real commitments not to engage in buybacks,"" lawmakers wrote in their letter.

About $33 billion of funding from the CHIPS Act has been allocated, mostly to major companies. According to a statement from the department, the awards are still preliminary and companies are still undergoing a due diligence review.

This isn't the first time Warren has sounded the alarm about companies that receive awards engaging in buybacks.

She wrote to BAE Systems earlier this year, and the company responded that every dollar from the grant will go to its Microelectronics Center. It also said decisions on buybacks were independent from any funds released through the CHIPS Act.

Nearly two in three workers around the world are ""vacation deprived,"" according to a new report published by Expedia. However, the report shows the feeling is highest among cultures that take the most days off. Some 84% of Germans and 69% of French respondents said they feel they don't have enough time off, according to Expedia's ""Vacation Deprivation Report"" published on June 20. That's despite respondents from both countries taking the most vacation days — 27 days and 29 days, respectively — in the survey. The survey of more than 11,500 workers showed Americans take the least time off per year (11 days), followed by Japan (12 days). However, only 53% of Japanese said they feel ""vacation deprived"" compared to 65% of Americans, it showed.

The survey — Expedia's 24th annual report on the topic — shows that while vacation deprivation rates have decreased in many parts of the world, the feeling is at an 11-year high in the United States.

What's happening in France and Germany?

Expedia's report indicates that feeling ""vacation deprived"" has less to do with the actual time off one takes, and more to do with cultural mores around work and free time. ""The French overwhelmingly view time off as a basic, fundamental right, while Americans seem to treat is as a guilty pleasure,"" said Christie Hudson, head of public relations for Expedia in the United States. ""This is why not even a month seems like enough time to the average French worker.""

Among Germans, however, only 42% said they feel their employers are supportive of them taking their vacation time, the lowest rate across all markets, said Hudson. ""This can contribute to guilt and being unable to unplug and feel refreshed after vacation,"" she said, adding that ""vacation deprivation"" can result from feeling unable to use the days off you are given, she said.

Wasted vacation days

Despite most workers indicating they feel vacation deprived, respondents from nearly every location admitted to letting some of their annual leave lapse.

Hong Kongers, however, meticulously planned their leave, not allowing a single day to go unused, on average, the report showed. Interestingly, Hong Kong was the only location where workers said they planned to take more time off than they're given, said Hudson. ""In 2024, 15% of Hong Kongers plan on taking 31 vacation days, exceeding the average allotted 25.5 days,"" said Hudson. ""It's an interesting finding and could be linked to the fact that they seem to have a strong pro-PTO culture: 80% of Hong Kong workers agree that their employers are supportive of employees taking their vacation time, which is one of the highest rates globally."" That could mean that ""those few extra days here and there are overlooked,"" she said. Singaporeans, too, carefully plan their time off, allowing only one of their 20 days of annual leave to lapse, according to the report. But those in Japan aren't nearly as focused on maximizing their days off, it showed. Respondents there left seven out of 19 days on the table, on average.

Bloomberg | Bloomberg | Getty Images

Optimism in artificial intelligence drove up Taiwan's stock market in the first of the 2024, making it the top performing market in Asia-Pacific so far this year. The Taiwan Weighted Index has surged 28% so far this year, powered by stocks along the AI value chain. Heavyweight Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Corp climbed 63% in the first half of the year, while its rival Foxconn — traded as Hon Hai Precision Industry — jumped 105% in the same period. ""The performance of global markets this year has been largely driven by the themes of Artificial Intelligence and central bank policy, and that is likely to continue,"" said Rahul Ghosh, global equity portfolio specialist at asset management company T. Rowe Price said in the firm's investment outlook. The potential and scale of the AI investment cycle continues to drive economic activity globally, he said, adding that the impact of AI investments are broadening out to sectors such as industrials, materials and utilities.

Japan's benchmark index Nikkei 225 ranked second in the region, after repeatedly surpassing all-time highs earlier this year. In the first six months of the year, the Nikkei has gained about 18%. The Nikkei smashed past a 34-year record in February, breaching its previous all-time high of 38,915.87, set on Dec. 29, 1989. Following that, the index surged past the psychological threshold of 40,000, and eventually reached a new all-time closing high of 40,888.43 on March 22. While Taiwan may lead Asian markets, Japan seems to be the favored market going forward, among analysts who spoke to CNBC.

Ghosh said that improved corporate governance standards continue to have a tangible — and considerable — impact on company performance in the world's fourth largest economy. Furthermore, a June 14 note from Ben Powell, chief APAC investment strategist at the BlackRock Investment Institute, pointed out that the Bank of Japan has increasing confidence it will meet its inflation targets, and as such, normalize its monetary policy ""in a gradual and measured way."" Powell said Japan's macroeconomic backdrop is favorable for risk assets. ""We remain overweight Japanese equities, driven by strong corporate reform momentum, healthy earnings and the valuation support from still-negative real interest rates."" While most Asian markets are in positive territory year-to-date, three stock markets — Thailand, Indonesia and the Philippines — fell into negative territory. Thailand's SET Index plunged 8% in the first six months, to be the worst performing index in the region. The Jakarta Composite was down by 2.88% while the Philippine stock exchange index slipped about 0.6% in the same period.

All eyes on the Fed

Most central banks in Asia are keeping a close eye on the Federal Reserve's next move, as they typically make monetary policy decisions based on the U.S. central bank's anticipated moves. The Fed signaled toward the end of 2023 that several rate cuts were on the cards this year. However, the most recent ""dot plot"" from the Fed's May meeting projected only one cut of 25 basis points for the remainder of 2024.This was a huge departure from the graph released at the end of March, where the Fed implied that rates will be cut by 75 basis points in 2024. The dot plot is a visual representation of each FOMC member's interest rate projection for the bank's short-term interest rate at specific points in the future. The central bank, however, has penciled in a more aggressive path to tightening monetary policy in 2025, increasing its forecast to four cuts of 25 basis points each.

watch now

Rate cut expectations have been pushed back repeatedly as inflation remained stickier than expected. Higher employment and wage growth in the U.S. also added to the narrative that there was no need for the Fed to lower rates. The question now is: When will the first rate cut happen? The CME FedWatch tool indicates that 61% of traders expect the Fed to cut rates by 25 basis points in the September meeting. But on June 16, Minneapolis Federal Reserve President Neel Kashkari said it's a ""reasonable prediction"" that the U.S. central bank will cut interest rates once this year, but will wait until December to do it. Kashkari's view was echoed by Ken Orchard, head of international fixed income at asset management firm T. Rowe Price. ""We still see the Fed cutting 25 basis points at its December policy meeting, after the November elections are out of the way, and possibly once in the summer.""

Facebook parent company Meta on Monday was accused by EU regulators of failing to comply with the bloc's landmark antitrust rules over its recently introduced ad-supported social networking service. The European Commission, which is the executive body of the EU, labeled the ad-supported subscription option a ""pay or consent"" model — which means users have to either pay to use Meta's platforms ad-free, or consent to their data being processed for personalized advertising. The service was introduced for Facebook and Instagram in Europe last year. ""In the Commission's preliminary view, this binary choice forces users to consent to the combination of their personal data and fails to provide them a less personalised but equivalent version of Meta's social networks,"" regulators said in a statement Monday. A Meta spokesperson told CNBC in a statement that its ad-supported subscription model ""follows the direction of the highest court in Europe and complies with the DMA."" ""We look forward to further constructive dialogue with the European Commission to bring this investigation to a close,"" the spokesperson added.

Meta introduced the new model in response to a ruling from the European Court of Justice, the EU's top court, last year that a company may offer an ""alternative"" version of its service that does not rely on data collection for ads. Meta has previously pointed to this ruling as a reason for introducing the subscription offer. In its statement Monday, the commission said that Meta's ad-supported offering failed to comply with the DMA for two key reasons: one is that it doesn't let users opt for a service that uses less personal data but is still equivalent to the ""personalized ads""-based service. Regulators said users should still be entitled to ""get access to an equivalent service which uses less of their personal data, in this case for the personalization of advertising."" The other reason cited by the European Union is that the Meta ad-supported service doesn't allow users to exercise their right to ""freely consent"" for their personal data to be used to target them with online ads.

French stocks staged a relief rally early Monday after results from the first round of the nation's snap election raised expectations of a hung parliament. The far-right National Rally party and its allies won 33.1% of the vote, the left-wing NFP alliance was second with 28% and Macron's coalition secured 20%, France's Interior Ministry said Monday. France's benchmark CAC 40 index was 1.3% higher by 10:17 a.m. London time, off earlier highs of more than 2.5%. ""The election, in the end, tells us pretty much what we knew before, which is that the most likely scenario remains a hung parliament,"" Sebastian Paris Horvitz, director of research at La Banque Postale Asset Management, told CNBC's ""Squawk Box Europe."" From a market perspective, that is the ""least bad"" option, he added, although it is far from ideal. ""Generally you have a majority to govern France. … After the second round, maybe we are not going to have such a majority. And so we have to figure out how France will be governed.""

Stock Chart Icon Stock chart icon CAC 40 index.

It comes after economists at Citi and elsewhere warned that an outright victory for either the far-right or leftist alliance could cause a severe market shock given their tax and spending plans, with the potential to spiral into a debt crisis. ""A hung parliament appears likely and would, we believe, be seen as a positive development for European assets, as markets would price in policies on tax and immigration that would more closely resemble the status quo,"" Matthew Ryan, head of market strategy at financial services firm Ebury, said in a note Monday. ""Following their strong showing in the first round, the possibility of a majority for National Rally remains in play, however, which could act to cap gains in the euro in the coming days.""

Stock Chart Icon Stock chart icon Euro/U.S. dollar.

The second round of the vote is due July 7 and to win a majority, the National Rally would need to secure 289 out of 577 seats in the National Assembly, France's lower house of parliament. Current candidates now have until Tuesday evening to confirm whether they will be proceeding to the final round. Some left-wing and centrist candidates who placed third in their local race are expected to drop out to avoiding splitting the vote, in an effort to curb far-right gains. This has added to uncertainty over the final result.

A key question remains who the prime minister will be — a position currently held by Gabriel Attal, an ally of President Emmanuel Macron. National Rally is hoping it will be the party's 28-year-old leader, Jordan Bardella. With Macron previously stating he plans to carry out the remainder of his term as president until 2027, this would lead to a ""cohabitation"" scenario in which the two roles are at odds. Even in a hung parliament — where no party has an overall majority, making it difficult to pass bills and implement a broad agenda — the French Constitution allows for the continuation of the current budget, so areas such as pension payments are not destabilized, Horvitz said.

""Still, there is no reform,"" he continued, noting this comes as a critical time for Europe as it deals with defense threats, the energy transition and weak French and German economic growth. Horvitz added that French borrowing costs, which have soared versus Germany's since the election was called, are likely to remain elevated. That will likely lead to continued pressure on assets linked to bonds, including bank stocks and some utilities, he said.

The U.S. stock market has become dominated by about a handful of companies in recent years. Some experts question whether that ""concentrated"" market puts investors at risk, though others think such fears are likely overblown. Let's look at the S&P 500 , the most popular benchmark for U.S. stocks, as an illustration of the dynamics at play. The top 10 stocks in the S&P 500, the largest by market capitalization, accounted for 27% of the index at the end of 2023, nearly double the 14% share a decade earlier, according to a recent Morgan Stanley analysis.

In other words, for every $100 invested in the index, about $27 was funneled to the stocks of just 10 companies, up from $14 a decade ago. That rate of increase in concentration is the most rapid since 1950, according to Morgan Stanley. It has increased more in 2024: The top 10 stocks accounted for 37% of the index as of June 24, according to FactSet data. The so-called ""Magnificent Seven"" — Apple , Amazon , Alphabet , Meta , Microsoft , Nvidia and Tesla — make up about 31% of the index, it said.

'A bit riskier than people realize'

Some experts fear the largest U.S. companies are having an outsized influence on investors' portfolios. For example, the Magnificent Seven stocks accounted for more than half the S&P 500's gain in 2023, according to Morgan Stanley. Just as those stocks helped push up overall returns, a downturn in one or many of them could put a lot of investor money in jeopardy, some said. For example, Nvidia shed more than $500 billion in market value after a recent three-day sell-off in June, dragging down the S&P 500 into a multiday losing streak. (The stock has since recovered a bit.) The S&P 500's concentration ""is a bit riskier than people realize,"" said Charlie Fitzgerald III, a certified financial planner based in Orlando, Florida. ""Nearly a third of [the S&P 500] is sitting in seven stocks,"" he said. ""You're not diversifying when you're concentrating like this.""

Why stock concentration may not be a concern

The S&P 500 tracks stock prices of the 500 largest publicly traded companies. It does so by market capitalization: The larger a firm's stock valuation, the larger its weighting in the index. Tech-stock euphoria has helped drive higher concentration at the top, particularly among the Magnificent Seven. Collectively, Magnificent Seven stocks are up about 57% in the past year, as of market close on June 27 — more than double the 25% return of the whole S&P 500. Chip maker Nvidia's stock alone has tripled in that time. More from Personal Finance:

Retirement 'super savers' have the biggest 401(k) balances

Households have seen their buying power grow Despite the sharp increase in stock concentration, some market experts believe the concern may be overblown. For one, many investors are diversified beyond the U.S. stock market. It's ""rare"" for 401(k) investors to own just a U.S. stock fund, for example, according to a recent analysis by John Rekenthaler, vice president of research at Morningstar. Many invest in target-date funds. A Vanguard TDF for near-retirees has a roughly 8% weighting to the Magnificent Seven, while one for younger investors who aim to retire in about three decades has a 13.5% weighting, Rekenthaler wrote in May.

There's precedent for this market concentration

Additionally, the current concentration isn't unprecedented by historical or global standards, according to the Morgan Stanley analysis. Research by finance professors Elroy Dimson, Paul Marsh and Mike Staunton shows that the top 10 stocks made up about 30% of the U.S. stock market in the 1930s and early 1960s, and about 38% in 1900.

The stock market was as concentrated (or more) around the late 1950s and early '60s, for example, a period when ""stocks did just fine,"" said Rekenthaler, whose research examines markets since 1958. ""We've been here before,"" he said. ""And when we were here before, it wasn't particularly bad news."" When there were big market crashes, they generally don't appear to have been associated with stock concentration, he added. When compared with the world's dozen largest stock markets, the U.S. market was the fourth-most-diversified at the end of 2023 — better than that of Switzerland, France, Australia, Germany, South Korea, the United Kingdom, Taiwan and Canada, Morgan Stanley said.

'Sometimes you can be surprised'

Big U.S. companies also generally seem to have the profits to back up their current lofty valuations, unlike during the peak of the dot-com bubble of the late 1990s and early 2000s, experts said. Present-day market leaders ""generally have higher profit margins and returns on equity"" than those in 2000, according to a recent Goldman Sachs Research report. The Magnificent Seven ""are not pie-in-the-sky"" companies: They're generating ""tremendous"" revenue for investors, said Fitzgerald, principal and founding member of Moisand Fitzgerald Tamayo. ""How much more gain can be made is the question,"" he added.

""It's worth paying attention to value,"" the firm's head of research told CNBC's ""ETF Edge"" this week. ""It feels like … [for a] long time that growth has outperformed value.""

On Friday, the Russell indexes underwent their annual reconstitution to reflect changes in the market as companies grow and shift. The iShares Russell 1000 Growth ETF is up 20% so far this year, while the iShares Russell 1000 Value ETF is up almost 6%.

""We do think there's a place for both growth and value within a broader portfolio — just people are skewed more toward growth heading into the second half of the year,"" he added. ""There have been periods when the pendulum has swung back in favor of value.""

FTSE Russell CEO Fiona Bassett said on ""ETF Edge"" the indices are built to reflect the nature of the market.

""One of the benefits of the Russell franchise generally is our ability to provide different sleeves of exposure,"" she said. ""So, for those people who want to get concentrated exposure to value or to growth, we have the indices available to do that.""

Roaring Kitty, whose legal name is Keith Gill, has stirred up trading in speculative names such as GameStop by posting cryptic images and memes online. A picture of a cartoon dog appeared on his X feed Thursday afternoon, briefly driving up Chewy shares as much as 34% to $39.10. The stock later fell into negative territory again in Thursday's session, closing the day down 0.3%.

Chewy shares rallied dramatically on Thursday after meme stock leader Roaring Kitty posted a picture on social media platform X that resembles the logo of the online pet food retailer, but the gains were quickly erased later in the session.

There's also a strong connection between meme stock GameStop and Chewy. GameStop CEO Ryan Cohen was the founder and CEO of Chewy, who was instrumental in PetSmart's takeover of Chewy in 2017 and its subsequent initial public offering in 2019.

Cohen joined the GameStop board of directors along with two other Chewy executives in January 2021, partly helping fuel the initial GameStop rally. He later took over as GameStop CEO in 2023, leading a turnaround in the brick-and-mortar video game retailer.

Shares in pet retailers such as Chewy and Petco saw big spikes during the pandemic when stuck-at-home consumers adopted cats and dogs in droves. With the adoptions came purchases of needed accessories such as new beds and leashes for their furry family members.

But as the pandemic ended and people began venturing outside again, adoption numbers slowed and consumers had less need for discretionary pet items such as toys and cages, which carry higher profit margins than pet food.

Over the past year or so, Chewy and Petco have seen consistently strong pet food sales, but revenue for higher margin categories has fallen.

Gill is a former marketer for Massachusetts Mutual Life Insurance. He came into the limelight after successfully encouraging retail investors to buy GameStop shares and call options in 2021 to squeeze out short-selling hedge funds. The mania in 2021 led to a series of congressional hearings featuring Gill in brokers' practices and the ""gamification"" of retail trading.","A picture of a cartoon dog appeared on his X feed Thursday afternoon, briefly driving up Chewy shares as much as 34% to $39.10.
The stock later fell into negative territory again in Thursday's session, closing the day down 0.3%.

Morgan Stanley is pushing further into its adoption of artificial intelligence with a new assistant that is expected to take over thousands of hours of labor for the bank's financial advisors. The assistant, called Debrief, keeps detailed logs of advisors' meetings and automatically creates draft emails and summaries of the discussions, bank executives told CNBC. Morgan Stanley plans to release the program to the firm's roughly 15,000 advisors by early July, marking one of the most significant steps yet for the use of generative AI at a major Wall Street bank. While the company's earlier efforts involved creating a ChatGPT-like service to help advisors navigate the firm's reams of research, Debrief brings AI into direct contact with advisors' most prized resource: their relationships with rich clients. The program, built using OpenAI's GPT-4, essentially sits in on client Zoom meetings, replacing the note-taking that advisors or junior employees have been doing by hand, according to Jeff McMillan, Morgan Stanley's head of firmwide artificial intelligence. ""What we're finding is that the quality and depth of the notes are just significantly better,"" McMillan told CNBC. ""The truth is, this does a better job of taking notes than the average human.""

Consent required

Importantly, clients must consent to being recorded each time Debrief is used. Future versions will allow advisors to use the program on corporate devices during in-person meetings, said McMillan. The rollout will serve as a real-world test for the vaunted productivity gains of generative AI, which took Wall Street by storm in recent months and has bolstered the value of chipmakers, tech giants and the broader U.S. stock market. Morgan Stanley's wealth management division hosts about 1 million Zoom calls a year, the bank told CNBC. While estimates vary, one Morgan Stanley advisor involved in the Debrief pilot said the program saves 30 minutes of work per meeting; advisors typically spend time after meetings creating notes and action plans to address client needs.

""As a financial adviser I'm doing four, five or six meetings a day,"" said Don Whitehead, a Houston-based advisor who's been testing the software. By ""having the note-taking service built in through AI, you can really be invested in the meeting, you're actually a lot more present."" It remains to be seen what advisors will do with the hours reclaimed from essential grunt work. In a sense, Morgan Stanley's projects in generative AI amount to a ""grand experiment in productivity,"" said McMillan. If, as McMillan and others believe, advisors will spend more time serving clients and prospecting for new ones, the technology should boost Morgan Stanley's growth in assets under management, as well as retention of clients and advisors. Morgan Stanley's wealth management division is one of the world's largest with $5.5 trillion in client assets as of March; the firm wants to reach $10 trillion. It will take at least a year to determine whether the technology is boosting advisor productivity, McMillan said. ""I'm the analytics guy, but the advisors will tell you that they're at their best when they're engaging"" with clients, said McMillan. ""None of them will tell you they love taking notes or looking at research reports, right? That's not why they got into this business.""

CNBC,https://www.cnbc.com/2024/06/26/your-401k-is-up-but-a-new-report-says-americans-need-to-save-more-.html,2024-06-26,11:00:06 UTC,"Your 401(k) is up, and a new report shows increased savings. But Americans need to do more","How's your 401(k) looking? A new report shows Americans are saving more, but probably need to do even more.

Vanguard has released its annual report, How America Saves 2024. Vanguard and Fidelity are the two biggest sponsors of 401(k) plans, and this is a snapshot of what nearly five million participants are doing with their money.

The good news: stock market returns are up and, thanks largely to automatic enrollment plans, investors are saving more than they did in the past.

The bad news: account balances for the median 401(k) of a person approaching retirement (65+) remains very low.

The takeaway: Americans are still very reliant on Social Security for a large chunk of their retirement.

Higher returns, participation rates, savings rates

Why do we care so much about 401(k) plans? Because it's the main private savings vehicle Americans have for retirement. More than 100 million Americans are covered by these ""defined contribution"" plans, with more than $10 trillion in assets.

First, 2023 was a good year to be an investor. The average total return rate for participants was 18.1%, the best year since 2019.

But to be effective vehicles for retirement, these plans need to: 1) have high participation rates, and 2) hold high levels of savings.

On those fronts, there is good news. John James, managing director of Vanguard's Institutional Investor Group, called it ""a year of progress.""

Plan participation reached all-time highs. Thanks to a change in the law several years ago, a record-high 59% of plans offered automatic enrollment in 401(k) plans. This is a major improvement: ipreviously, enrollment in 401(k) plans were often short of expectations because investors had to ""opt-in,"" that is they had to choose to participate in the plan. Because of indecision or simple ignorance, many did not. By switching to automatic enrollment, participants were automatically enrolled and had to ""opt-out"" if they did not want to participate.

The result: enrollment rates have gone up. Plans with automatic enrollment had a 94% participation rate, compared with 67% for voluntary enrollment plans.

Participant saving rates reached all time highs. The average participant deferred 7.4% of their savings. Including employee and employer contributions, the average total participant contribution rate was 11.7%.

A few other observations about Vanguard's 401(k) plan investors:

They prefer equities and target date funds. They love equities over bonds or any other investments. The average plan contribution to equities is 74%. A record-high 64% of all 2023 contributions went into target-date funds, which automatically adjust stock and bond allocations as the participant ages.

They don't trade much. In 2023, only 5% of nonadvised participants traded within their accounts; 95% did no trading at all. ""Over the past 15 years, we have generally observed a decline in participant trading,"" Vanguard said, which it partially attributed to increased adoption of target-date funds.

Despite gains in the market, account balances are still low

In 2023, the average account balance for Vanguard participants was $134,128, but the median balance (half had more, half had less) was only $35,286.

Why such a big difference between the average and the median? Because a small group of investors with large balances pull up the averages. Forty percent of participants had less than $20,000 in their retirement accounts.

Distribution of account balances

Less than $20,000 40%

$20,000-$99,999 30%

$100,000-$249,900 15%

$250,000 + 15%

Median balances for those near retirement are still low

A different way to look at the problem is to ask how much people who are retirement age have saved, because it's an indication of how prepared they are for imminent retirement.

Investors 65 years or older had an average account balance of $272,588, but a median balance of only $88,488.

A median balance of $88,488 is not much when you consider older participants have higher incomes and higher savings rates. That is not much money for a 65-year old nearing retirement.

Of course, these balances don't necessarily reflect total lifetime savings. Some have more than one retirement plan because they had other plans with previous employers. Most do have other sources of retirement savings, typically Social Security. A shrinking number may also have a pension. Some may have money in checking accounts, or have stocks or bonds outside a retirement account.

Regardless, the math does not look great

So let's do some retirement math.

A typical annual drawdown for a 401(k) account in retirement is about 4%. Drawing down 4% of $88,488 a year gets you $3,539 every 12 months.

Next, Social Security. As of January 2023, the average Social Security benefit was almost $1,689 per month, or about $20,268 per year.

Finally, even though pensions are a vanishing benefit, let's include them.

According to the Pension Rights Center, the median annual pension benefit for a private pension is $9,262 (government employees have higher benefits).

Here's our yearly retirement budget:

Personal savings $3,539

Pension $9,262

Social Security $20,264

Total: $33,065

It's certainly possibly to live on $33,000 a year, but this would likely only work if you own your home, have low expenses and live in a low-cost part of the country.

Even then, it would hardly be a robust retirement.

And these are the lucky ones. Only 57% of retirees have a tax-deferred retirement account like a 401(k) or IRA. Only 56% reported receiving income from a pension.

And that extra income largely determines whether a retiree feels good or bad about their retirement.

In 2023, four out five retirees said they were doing at least okay financially, but this varied tremendously depending on whether retirees had sources of income outside of Social Security. Only 52% of retirees who did not have private income said they were doing at least okay financially.

What can be done?

To have a more robust retirement, Americans are just going to have to save more.

One issue is investors still don't contribute the maximum amount allowed. Only 14% of participants saved the statutory maximum amount of $22,500 per year ($30,000 for those age 50 or older). The likely reason: most felt they couldn't afford to.

However, only 53% of even those with income over $150,000 contributed the maximum allowed. Given that the employee match is ""free money,"" one would think participants in that income bracket would rationally choose to max out their contribution. The fact that many still don't suggests that more investor education is needed.

Regardless, it's very dangerous to assume that retirees are going to be bailed out by an ever-rising stock market. Another year anywhere near 2022, when the S&P 500 was down 20%, and investor confidence in their financial future will likely deteriorate.","The bad news: account balances for the median 401(k) of a person approaching retirement (65+) remains very low.

Athit Perawongmetha | Reuters

DALIAN, China — For China's yuan to be used more globally, the currency needs more ""applications"" such as for stocks and bonds, Bonnie Chan, CEO of Hong Kong Exchanges and Clearing Limited, said on a panel Tuesday. Beijing has long touted its ambitions for increasing global use of the Chinese yuan — also known as the ""renminbi"" or ""RMB"" — in an international financial market where the U.S. dollar is the dominant currency. U.S. sanctions on Russia have also increased the pressure on some countries to have alternatives to the greenback. Chan, speaking during the World Economic Forum's ""Summer Davos"" meeting in Dalian, China, noted that people hold a currency for trade, or, more importantly, as a store of wealth. ""We're not just going to hold on to a bunch of RMB and put it into this bank account,"" she said. ""You want to have bonds, you want to have equities, etc."" ""One of our strategic imperatives [has] been changed to make sure that we continue to produce more RMB-denominated security products,"" Chan said, ""so that investors around the world can actually see more applications of the RMB and be able to use those as the medium to store wealth in the form of the RMB.""

Last year, the HKEX announced a ""Dual-Counter"" program that allows investors to trade Hong Kong-listed securities in Hong Kong dollars or Chinese yuan. In a significant step toward internationalization of the yuan, the International Monetary Fund in 2015 announced that it would add the yuan to its basket of reserve currencies the following year. The yuan was the fourth-most active currency for global payments by value in May, accounting for nearly 4.5% of such transactions, according to the interbank messaging network SWIFT. The U.S. dollar had a nearly 48% share. In trade finance, the yuan ranked third at about 5.1% in May, according to SWIFT. The euro was slightly higher at 5.6%, while the U.S. dollar dominated with a nearly 85% share, the data showed. Fred Hu, founder, chairman and CEO of Primavera Capital, said on the same panel Tuesday that the internationalization of the yuan is probably going to take longer than many expect, despite an increased amount of statements from Beijing. While China is the largest trading nation and has large financial centers, ""we're not as big, as deep as the U.S.,"" Hu said. ""Besides our capital account is also closed, it's not fully convertible, [which] also in some way [is] hampering the internationalization of the renminbi.""

A maturing financial market

Developing more Chinese yuan-denominated investment products also requires a maturation of the local financial sector. Part of that includes having a more sophisticated investor base. Chan said that during the annual Lujiazui Financial Forum in Shanghai last week, nearly every conversation with top leaders included the term ""patient investing."" The phrase has emerged in official releases to encourage long-term investing over short-term speculation. ""Patience comes from learning through the market volatility,"" Kenny Lam, CEO of Two Sigma Asia-Pacific, said during the same panel on Tuesday. He said that policymakers have been giving more thought to making their policies more stable and consistent.

Pride month is winding down — and this year, the corporate world took a more cautious approach. June tends to bring a wave of rainbow-themed merchandise and affirming ads and social media posts from retailers and consumers brands, coinciding with parades and other events that celebrate the LGBTQ+ community. As the presidential election approaches, however, some companies have grown quieter about diversity, equity and inclusion efforts to avoid stepping into the culture wars or facing the blowback from conservative customers that Target and Bud Light did a year ago. The starkest example of that came late Thursday: Tractor Supply, a retailer that sells animal feed, cowboy boots and lawn supplies in rural parts of the country, said it is ending all spending tied to diversity and environmental causes. That includes no longer sponsoring Pride festivals, the statement said. The move, while an outlier in its magnitude, underscores how some companies that made inclusion commitments in recent years are treading cautiously. It is difficult to track how many companies shared supportive messages, donated to LGBTQ+ causes or sold rainbow-themed merchandise in June compared to previous years. According to Gravity Research, a Washington, D.C.-based reputational research firm, 45% of Fortune 100 companies had at least one social media post on LinkedIn or X explicitly related to Pride as of June 21 this year, compared with 51% last June. Gravity Research President Luke Hartig said the volatility of the presidential election and the two candidates' willingness to call out companies by name has also made companies less likely to go public about their stand. ""There's a little bit of like, 'keep our heads down while we go through this election,'"" he said. Tim Bennett, cofounder of Tribury Productions, a marketing company that specializes in reaching LGBTQ+ Americans, works with Fortune 500 companies, including recent projects with Procter & Gamble. He said more clients have taken ""a wait-and-see"" approach to marketing to LGBTQ+ consumers or decided to scatter efforts throughout the year instead of making a big splash in a single month. ""June this year has not been like the last five or six,"" Bennett said. That may not be a bad thing for LGBTQ+ initiatives and charities. Sarah Kate Ellis, CEO of nonprofit advocacy group GLAAD, said she's seeing more companies get involved with year-round philanthropy and activism in more meaningful ways. She also pointed to a survey by Gravity Research that found that 78% of companies did not plan to change their Pride strategy this year. Thirteen percent were unsure whether they'd make changes and 9% said they planned to revise their strategy. Gravity Research surveyed 45 corporate executives and Fortune 500 leaders across industries in April. ""The visibility of companies putting flags out and having product to celebrate our Pride and to mark a month that's really significant and important for our community is really important, and I don't want to ever devalue that,"" Ellis said. ""I do think, though, those companies must look inside and make sure that they have the policies and the HR practices that match their outward marketing."" Major companies are still writing checks for LGBTQ+ causes, too. A GLAAD spokesperson said Friday that the group has not seen donations or corporate support decline this Pride month, though it does not yet have a total tally. On Friday, when the Stonewall National Monument Visitor Center officially opened its doors to commemorate the New York City bar that was a catalyst in the LGBTQ+ rights movement, the event had major backing from the business community. Supporters included Google, Amazon, JPMorgan Chase and Booking.com. President Joe Biden also made an appearance and remarks at the monument's opening.

The Bud Light and Target effect

Consumer staples brands were the most likely to say they planned to shift their Pride month strategy this year, according to Gravity Research's survey. That may stem from the conservative boycotts of Target and Bud Light last year. Target has carried a Pride collection for over a decade. Yet last year, the big-box retailer removed some items and moved displays after employees faced threats. Boycotters targeted items for transgender shoppers, such as ""tuck-friendly"" swimsuits, and also criticized separate Pride merchandise for kids. Instead of putting Pride merchandise in all stores this year, Target only carried it in the locations that accounted for 90% of total Pride sales in 2022 and 2023. It also stopped selling any Pride apparel for kids. On the company's website and in those select stores, shoppers can find a wide variety of Pride-themed items. The volume of negative feedback to the Pride collection externally and internally is ""significantly lower"" this year than in 2023, according to a Target spokesperson. In a statement, Target said it is ""committed to supporting the LGBTQIA+ community during Pride Month and year-round"" and would participate in Pride events across the country and support LGBTQ+ groups, in addition to offering Pride products.

Anheuser-Busch InBev and other large beer brands, on the other hand, have backed away from public support of the LGBTQ+ community. Conservatives like singer Kid Rock and Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis called for a boycott of the beer and its parent company, Anheuser-Busch InBev, after Bud Light sent personalized cans of its beer to transgender influencer Dylan Mulvaney. The marketing campaign coincided with the March Madness college basketball tournament. Bud Light sales tumbled around 25%, and the brand lost its spot as the best-selling beer in the U.S., ceding the position it held for more than two decades to Constellation Brands' Modelo. AB InBev distanced itself from Mulvaney and fired Bud Light's vice president of marketing. In October, AB InBev CEO Michel Doukeris said the brand would focus its marketing more on events like sports games and concerts. It also returned as the official sponsor of the UFC. In recent months, some consumers have returned to Bud Light, as RBC Europe analysts estimate that the brand's U.S. volume is down only about 10% these days. For its part, Bud Light hasn't posted in support of Pride month on its Instagram or X pages this year. The boycott was unusually sticky for a few reasons, according to Neil Reid, a geography professor at the University of Toledo who researches the beer industry. Studies have shown that consumers' loyalty to top-selling beers may be more tied to the brand than the taste, Reid said. Right-wing news outlets like Fox News also devoted plenty of airtime to the controversy, stretching its duration and potentially reaching new consumers who missed the initial reaction. Plus, once Bud Light sales fell, retailers gave more shelf space to its rivals. ""You can look at this issue from a moral, ethical perspective or you can also look at it from a pure business perspective. Those two often don't result in the same strategy,"" Reid said.

DETROIT — Purchasing a vehicle has never been that easy. But shoppers entering traditional dealer showrooms for the foreseeable future may have a new challenge: An alphabet soup of ""electrified"" vehicle offerings. As all-electric vehicle adoption crawls along in the U.S., automakers are increasingly releasing various hybrid vehicles as alternative options to EVs and traditional gas-powered engines. A variety of models means more customer choice, but also more complexity for automakers and consumers, many of whom are returning to the new vehicle market for the first time in years following unprecedented supply chain shortages and record used vehicle prices. ""More choice in the marketplace is good for consumers, but only if they understand the differences,"" said Paul Waatti, director of industry analysis at AutoPacific. ""There needs to be more clarity on what the terms and acronyms actually mean, and what the potential benefits and drawbacks are."" A car shopper today has their pick of traditional internal combustion engine (ICE) vehicles; mild-hybrid electric vehicles (MHEVs); hybrid electric vehicles (HEVs); plug-in hybrid electric vehicles (PHEVs); fuel cell electric vehicles (FCEVs) and battery-electric vehicles (BEVs), also commonly known as EVs. Also coming later this year from Stellantis : range-extended electric vehicles (REEVs) that are similar to plug-in hybrid vehicles but can exclusively function as an EV, with its electric motors powered by a gas engine. Each type of vehicle may be better for a different kind of customer. All except EVs and fuel-cell vehicles continue to offer a traditional internal combustion engine combined with ""electrified"" technologies such as a battery or motor to assist in performance or fuel economy. Heather Seymour, of St. Johns, Florida, said she did quite a bit of research prior to purchasing a 2022 Jeep Wrangler Rubicon plug-in hybrid electric vehicle, known as a 4xe model. ""I knew I wanted to kind of dip my toe in the water of the hybrids. I wasn't ready to go full electric, so the plug-in was definitely of interest to me,"" said Seymour, who said she typically uses the all-electric range of the SUV, except on longer trips. ""The more we learned about it, the more we figured out what we wanted.""

EV naming

While consumers may not need to know every acronym or technology to find their right model, automakers aren't exactly helping the situation with their consumer-facing naming. For example, Hyundai's Genesis brand calls its all-electric vehicles ""electrified,"" while many others reserve that term for hybrids. Chrysler's Pacifica minivan is a plug-in hybrid labeled as a regular ""hybrid,"" and Toyota markets some of its traditional hybrids as ""hybrid EVs."" Stellantis says its REEV vehicles are not PHEVs, despite operating similarly. ""Every automaker is using different terms. There's no standardization, and that causes some confusion on the consumer side,"" Waatti said.

Some automakers such as General Motors also use traditional nameplates such as the Chevrolet Blazer and Equinox for new EVs that share little to nothing with their gas-powered counterparts other than the name. Stellantis' Jeep also uses the ""Wagoneer"" moniker for two large gas-powered SUVs as well as a smaller, all-electric Wagoneer ""S"" SUV. Jeep CEO Antonio Filosa has said he isn't worried about any confusion, as the brand has a strong naming heritage and customers can decide which vehicle is best for their needs. ""I believe that we need education, but after education we have a lot of choices for the consumer,"" he said during a recent interview. ""It's all for the benefit of the consumer. They will have a lot of flexibility.""

Education is key

One thing automotive executives from Japan and South Korea to Detroit and Germany can agree on is the need for consumer education. Whether vehicles are electrified or all-electric, they're critical for automakers to meet tightening emissions and fuel economy targets as well as to build production scale, reduce prices and increase profits. ""We don't want to force a customer to do something they're not ready for,"" Kia America VP of Marketing Russell Wager told CNBC earlier this year. ""We're trying our best to educate them.""

Kia and its dealers have put out myth-busting pages online to answer concerns or frequently asked questions about EVs and hybrids. They range from technical questions about batteries to practical questions like whether you can go through a car wash in an EV (you can). GM has taken it a step further. The Detroit automaker launched ""EV Live"" in 2022. It's an online video platform, now known as ""GM Energy Live,"" that allows participants to interact one-on-one with EV specialists and learn about electric vehicles and charging. Ford Motor recently launched its own video-based training program, geared toward its more than 3,000 U.S. franchised dealers to improve customer service, better engage employees and provide dealers and the company with more data to help in selling the vehicles. Auto executives say it's up to the companies as well as their dealers to be trained and educated about the benefits of the vehicles, whatever they may be. ""Each customer, in the end, is very different,"" said Jérémie Papin, chair of Nissan Americas, earlier this year. ""I think it's what the vehicle can do for them,"" not necessarily how the technology works, he said.

Range-extended electric vehicles (REEV): These are an emerging technology that largely function as a PHEV, however after the battery runs out of energy to power the vehicle, an engine works as a generator to exclusively power electric motors. The vehicle still drives like an EV instead of having the engine directly power the vehicle's motion.

Pfizer had a ""phenomenal"" first quarter — and Wall Street took notice, CEO Albert Bourla told thousands of employees during a companywide town hall on May 2, according to a recording heard by CNBC. A day earlier, the pharmaceutical giant's stock had closed 6% higher after its quarterly results topped analyst estimates and it hiked its full-year outlook. It was a far cry from the year prior, when Pfizer's shares plunged more than 40%, making it one of the worst-performing large pharmaceutical stocks of 2023. Its market cap of about $157 billion is now less than half of its 2021 peak of nearly $350 billion. Few companies benefited from the pandemic as much as Pfizer did. The drugmaker's profits boomed, fueled by its Covid vaccine and antiviral pill Paxlovid. After Pfizer and German company BioNTech rapidly developed and deployed a lifesaving shot that helped the world emerge from the pandemic, Pfizer drew widespread praise. Pfizer's success contributed to its equally jarring fall from grace. When the virus receded in 2023, its Covid products revenue plummeted. The world, which hailed Pfizer as a pandemic hero a few years earlier, no longer needed the company in the same way. Pfizer may be on its way toward stabilizing its business and winning back Wall Street's favor after the strong first quarter. But the company is struggling to balance that with the fears of its employees, some of whom said they feel uncertain about their future and unmotivated after the sudden reversal of fortune. In October Pfizer launched a multibillion-dollar cost-cutting program, slashing research and development spending and laying off hundreds of employees — including in the once-lauded Covid vaccine unit. In May the company said it's on track to deliver $4 billion in savings by the end of the year.

Stock Chart Icon Stock chart icon Pfizer's stock surged after it rolled out its Covid vaccine and antiviral treatment, then plunged when the company's Covid revenue started to drop.

Now, as Pfizer appears poised to turn a corner, the company is trying to boost employee morale to match Wall Street's optimism. CNBC spoke with 11 current and former Pfizer employees — all of whom asked to remain anonymous for fear of retaliation — about Pfizer's dizzying climb, rapid decline and turnaround strategy. The company's seesawing fortunes have fueled uncertainty within Pfizer's workforce. Most of the current and former employees CNBC spoke with called Pfizer a good place to work, and some current employees said they feel optimistic about the direction of the company after the first quarter. But other current employees are dissatisfied with where the strategy shift has left them. Some cited higher workloads after teams were stretched thin by budget cuts, a return-to-office policy they said has forced out some remote workers, and doubts about how the business will perform moving forward. The company's separate multiyear cost-cutting program announced in May is also stoking fears about the potential for new U.S. layoffs, according to some current workers. Some employees working in certain manufacturing and supply chain divisions, which they believe are likely to be affected by the cuts, described having low morale and motivation to work. Meanwhile, several former Pfizer employees, most of whom were laid off over the last six months or left voluntarily, said they're unhappy with how the company handled cost cuts in 2023. Some alleged that Pfizer management provided little transparency around the layoffs and seemed more focused on the company's stock performance than its staff throughout the process. During the latest town hall, Bourla told employees that layoffs in the U.S. have been completed but that more are occurring internationally. He called the job cuts ""very, very painful"" and said it was ""killing"" him to let employees go. But he also acknowledged that Wall Street likes the cuts. ""And, of course, I'm very concerned with everyone that could be affected and impacted by that, but it works,"" Bourla said, according to the recording. ""And we saw it, how the Street will respond."" A Pfizer spokesperson said reducing costs will ""put us on strong footing towards margin expansion and improved financial returns moving forward."" The spokesperson added that cutting expenses is one of Pfizer's five priorities for the year, along with maximizing the performance of new products, innovating its drug pipeline, growing its oncology business with its acquisition of cancer drugmaker Seagen, and allocating capital to increase its dividend, reduce outstanding debt and reinvest in the business. To cut costs, apart from layoffs the company is trimming its drug portfolio and direct marketing spending, shrinking its real estate footprint and reducing its investment in Covid, among other efforts, said the spokesperson. The spokesperson said Pfizer does not take the layoffs ""lightly"" and that the company is ""focused on providing our impacted colleagues with the resources and compassion they deserve.""

What went wrong in 2023

Pfizer entered 2023 on a high. The company had just capped a record-breaking 2022 with $100 billion in sales, more than half of which came from its Covid vaccines and Paxlovid. Employee morale at Pfizer was relatively high at the time, some current and former workers told CNBC. The company had gone on a hiring spree and piled money into different projects, they said. The success came with trade-offs. Two former employees involved in developing the Covid vaccine manufacturing process said they were experiencing burnout at the start of 2023. In January 2023, Pfizer forecast a steep drop in annual revenue, to between $67 billion and $71 billion. That outlook included $13.5 billion and $8 billion in sales of Covid vaccines and Paxlovid, respectively. But it could not predict at the time just how much revenue would dry up.

During an earnings call that same month, Pfizer executives said they expected roughly 24% of the U.S. population to get an annual Covid booster in 2023. But by December, only around 17% of U.S. adults had received the new Covid shots from Pfizer and Moderna, according to data from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Many Americans who got previous Covid shots felt they did not need more protection because the threat of the virus had diminished, according to recent surveys. Meanwhile, use of Paxlovid in the U.S. was dented by reductions in Covid testing and infection rates, and by doctors' concerns about interactions with common medications, among other factors. As demand plummeted, the federal government returned millions of the antiviral treatment courses to Pfizer. In January this year, however, Pfizer said fewer courses were returned by the end of 2023 than it had expected. The company soon acknowledged the challenges its Covid business faced towards the end of 2023. In October, Pfizer said it slashed both ends of its 2023 sales guidance by around $9 billion ""solely due to its Covid products."" At the same time, Pfizer started to cut costs. The company still hasn't said how many employees it laid off, though it reduced staff around the world. Pfizer's 2023 revenue ultimately came in at $58.5 billion, including $11.22 billion from its Covid vaccine and $1.28 billion from Paxlovid. The end of the year brought other challenges for Pfizer: The company scrapped the twice-daily version of its experimental weight loss drug, danuglipron, and saw slower uptake for a newly launched RSV vaccine in the U.S. than competitor GSK saw with its own version. After the string of difficulties, investors showed relief when Pfizer announced the cost cuts. But for many employees, the shift in post-pandemic strategy was a nightmare, they told CNBC. During a conference in January, Bourla acknowledged that 2023 was a rough year for the company and its stock price. But he said Pfizer took steps to start 2024 with a ""clean slate."" Those included renegotiating multibillion-dollar Covid contracts with the EU and other governments, transitioning its Covid products to the commercial market in several countries and writing off unused stock of its vaccine and Paxlovid. ""So it's not simple, how many people will use the vaccine. There were a lot of things we had to remove"" he said. Bourla also touted Pfizer's portfolio of new products that it said will boost sales, including nine new product approvals in the U.S. last year and a pipeline of drugs that could bring in more future revenue. Pfizer has also repeatedly said that the Seagen deal brings a proven antibody-drug conjugate platform that enhances its commercial structure and could help the company become a ""world-class oncology leader."" Pfizer has said Seagen could contribute more than $10 billion in risk-adjusted sales by 2030 with its targeted cancer therapies. Those revenue streams would help Pfizer prepare for upcoming patent expirations for blockbuster drugs, including its breast cancer treatment Ibrance, and Eliquis, a blood thinner it shares with Bristol Myers Squibb .

A 'slap in the face'

Some current and former employees said they knew early in 2023 that wide-scale layoffs were possible. Those people alleged that Pfizer has long had a culture of hiring too many people and later laying many employees off — a cycle seen at many other large companies. Pfizer wasn't the only Covid-boom company whose business declined. Biotech company Moderna 's revenue from its Covid shot also plunged in 2023. Companies outside the pharmaceutical industry that flourished in 2020, including fitness firm Peloton and digital meeting platform Zoom , also struggled to adjust as people returned to their pre-pandemic lives. Other drugmakers big and small are still downsizing and restructuring their workforces. Big pharmaceutical companies, such as Bristol Myers Squibb, are trying to conserve cash as they could lose revenue from upcoming drug patent expirations and Medicare drug price negotiations, among other threats. Biotech companies are also working to stay afloat after a rough 2023 marked by rising interest rates, a poor deal market and a lack of fundraising. At Pfizer, there were other warnings of trouble ahead, according to current and former employees: a small round of layoffs during the first quarter of 2023 and budget restrictions that limited travel, team lunch outings and purchases of new lab and manufacturing equipment. Pfizer's announcement in March 2023 that it would acquire Seagen for a whopping $43 billion was another sign, according to some current and former employees. While most of the 11 workers acknowledged that the deal made sense for Pfizer's growth, they said the hefty price tag at a time when Covid sales had already started to decline left them uneasy. Still, a few former employees said they felt blindsided by the company's decision to let go of staff, saying they were relatively optimistic about the business before the October cost-cut announcement. One former employee who worked at a site focused on gene therapies in Durham, North Carolina, said they were repeatedly told their job would be safe — even as Pfizer divested much of its early stage portfolio for those treatments at the start of 2023. The company confirmed with news outlets in October that it would close that site and lay off an undisclosed number of staff. Notably, Pfizer's layoffs also affected some workers involved in the research, development and manufacturing of the company's Covid vaccine, according to some current and former employees. They said those workers, whom Pfizer celebrated as pandemic heroes just a year earlier, felt especially betrayed by the cuts. ""It felt like we were tossed out the door when they no longer needed us,"" said one former employee who worked on the vaccine.

All the current and former employees who spoke with CNBC said they believed the company handled the layoffs and the months leading up to them poorly. Some workers said they were disappointed with what they called higher management's lack of transparency around the layoffs. Some also questioned why Pfizer did not set more realistic expectations for its Covid business earlier, especially as cases and public concern about the virus diminished in the U.S. On Oct. 17, just a few days after Pfizer publicly announced its cost-cutting program to investors, executives held a companywide town hall with Pfizer's more than 80,000-person workforce that one worker described as ""disastrous"" and another called a ""slap in the face."" On the town hall, Bourla and Pfizer Chief Human Experience Officer Payal Sahni Becher acknowledged the company's Covid business was struggling but said it was positioning for growth with the cost cuts, according to some current and former employees. Those people said the executives addressed the looming layoffs during the town hall but provided scant details on how many workers, teams or sites they would affect, when they would occur or how the company decided who would lose their jobs. Many workers also alleged that Bourla and Becher were too casual during the town hall, cracking light jokes and chuckling at some of the questions asked by staff, such as one about employee bonuses.

Return-to-office policies

On top of layoffs, return-to-office policies launched in 2023 forced out some workers in fully remote roles, some current and former employees said. Those people said some fully remote employees had their virtual work status revoked and were asked to start working in person at their site starting on a certain date under the new mandates. While some workers were asked to come in only two or three days a week, even that was impossible for staff members who lived too far from their sites, according to the employees. Some remote workers who did not comply over time were let go, the current and former employees said. A Pfizer spokesperson did not confirm or provide any details about its recent return-to-office policies. ""The return to office has been possibly the worst managed factor in all of this,"" one current employee said.

Those policies also applied to workers who were relocated from recently closed facilities, according to some employees. For example, Pfizer in October said it would shut down its office in Peapack, New Jersey in 2024, which affected nearly 800 workers. The company first announced those plans in 2021. Pfizer told news outlets that the majority of employees would be relocated to its headquarters in New York City. For one employee, a 15-minute commute to work became closer to an hour-and-a-half trip. During another town hall, on Oct. 26, Pfizer Chief Global Supply Officer Mike McDermott said the decision to close the Peapack site ""wasn't made lightly."" But he said having Peapack employees work in person at the company's headquarters was ""right for Pfizer's culture,"" according to a recording heard by CNBC. He said the company isn't taking away remote work as an option. Pfizer leadership has been vocal about asking employees to work in person again. ""Teleconferencing is simply no substitute for the personal interaction that makes it possible to share ideas, build connection, or even agree to disagree,"" Bourla said during the APEC CEO Summit in November. Pfizer is just one of several companies across different industries to push for in-person work again after the pandemic. Tech giants such as Google similarly reversed course on remote work in 2023 after offering flexibility to employees throughout Covid, reportedly frustrating workers.

Employee morale

Employee morale plummeted in the months after the October layoff announcement, according to current and former employees. Some of those people said they were unmotivated to work with their job security in question, while one worker described ""walking on eggshells"" for weeks out of fear that they would lose their job. Other employees said they were stretched thin due to understaffing and a lack of other resources. A few workers said they struggled to keep up with abrupt internal changes, such as being assigned to new managers or being moved onto different teams. Some current employees said Pfizer has held several so-called transparency meetings, which allow workers to anonymously ask questions and provide feedback to senior leadership. Faith in executive leadership also plunged among some workers, according to most of the current and former employees who spoke with CNBC. Some employees acknowledged that executives have a duty to care about their company's stock price but said that Bourla and other officials appeared to be hyper-focused on Pfizer shares even as people lost their jobs. Some current workers said that hasn't appeared to change after the town hall on May 2. Others said Bourla's remarks were encouraging and sounded far more genuine.

Nike CEO John Donahoe appears to be on thin ice. The former top executive of eBay , who has been at the helm of Nike since January 2020, is starting to lose Wall Street's confidence after the company capped off a lackluster fiscal year with more bad news. On Thursday, Nike warned that sales in its current quarter were expected to decline by a staggering 10% – far worse than the 3.2% drop LSEG had projected – after it posted its slowest annual sales gain in 14 years, excluding the Covid-19 pandemic. The company also said it expects fiscal 2025 sales to be down mid-single digits when it previously expected them to grow. The warning signs led shares to close 20% lower on Friday -- making it the worst trading day in the company's history since its IPO in Dec. 1980. The plunge wiped about $28 billion off of Nike's market cap, bringing it to just under $114 billion from $142 billion a day earlier. As Wall Street digested the dismal outlook from the world's largest sportswear company, at least six investment banks downgraded Nike's stock. Analysts at Morgan Stanley and Stifel took it a step further, specifically calling the company's management into question. ""The FY25 guide (the 5th downward consensus revision in 6 quarters), pushes prospects for growth inflection further into 2025 (perhaps FY4Q or spring '25 at the earliest) asking investors to both underwrite success of not yet proven styles and look across an uncertain consumer discretionary backdrop into 2HCY24 until momentum could build again into 2HCY25,"" wrote Stifel analyst Jim Duffy. ""Management credibility is severely challenged and potential for C-level regime change adds further uncertainty.""

Stock Chart Icon Stock chart icon Nike stock has underperformed the S&P 500 during CEO John Donahoe's tenure.

Since Donahoe took over as Nike's top executive, its stock is down more than 25% as of Friday's close, significantly underperforming both the S&P 500 and the XRT – the retail-focused ETF – which saw gains of around 67% and 66% in that time period, respectively. Nike finance chief Matt Friend on Thursday attributed the guidance cut to a host of factors. Some, like softness in China and challenging foreign exchange headwinds, are outside of Nike's control, but others are problems it squarely created under Donahoe's leadership. The company is expecting wholesale orders to be slow as it scales new styles, pulls back on classic franchises and works to repair its relationships with key retail partners after spending the last few years cutting them off in favor of a direct-selling strategy. At the same time, loyal customers who shop on Nike's website are no longer springing for new pairs of Air Force 1s, Air Jordan 1s or Dunks, the company's core franchises. Critics say the sneaker lines have dominated the retailer's offerings for too long and turned customers away as they sought fresh styles and innovative designs from a slew of upstart competitors. That's left Nike to win back some of its most essential customers – runners. As the retailer focused on its direct-selling strategy at the expense of innovation, scrappy competitors like On Running and Hoka snatched up market share.","In this article NKE Follow your favorite stocks CREATE FREE ACCOUNTJohn Donahoe, attends the first day of the annual Allen & Company Sun Valley Conference, in Sun Valley, Idaho.

Tractor Supply, a retail chain that sells home improvement equipment, livestock and agricultural supplies for farmers and pet owners, is eliminating diversity, equity and inclusion roles; withdrawing carbon emission goals; and walking back support for the LGBTQ community as part of sweeping changes to environmental, social and governance initiatives, the company announced this week.

The retailer said in a Thursday release that it will no longer submit data to the Human Rights Campaign, an LGBTQ advocacy group. The company will also stop sponsoring Pride festivals and voting campaigns, the release said. The company previously earned a perfect score on the Human Rights Campaign Foundation's 2022 Best Places to Work Corporate Equality Index.

The announcement comes in the final days of Pride Month.

Tractor Supply is also retiring initiatives aimed at reducing environmental impact and improving employee diversity. The company had set goals to achieve net zero carbon emissions in operations by 2040 and to reduce its water usage by 2025. Its DEI targets included boosting the number of employees of color at the manager level and above by 50% by 2026.

Tractor Supply said it's making the changes to better represent the values of the communities and customers it serves. The retailer caters to largely rural communities, with 50,000 employees across 2,250 stores in 49 states, according to company data.

""Rural communities are the backbone of our nation and what make America great,"" Tractor Supply said in the news release. ""We have heard from customers that we have disappointed them. We have taken this feedback to heart.""

Tractor Supply said it has invested millions of dollars in veteran causes, state fairs, animal shelters, rodeos and farmers markets and that it invests in the future of rural America by being the largest supporter of FFA, a nonprofit that promotes agricultural education for middle and high schoolers.

The retailer was previously included on Newsweek's list of America's Greatest Workplaces for Diversity in 2023 and was named to Bloomberg's Gender Equality Index for 2022 and 2023.

The publicly traded company has a market valuation of about $29 billion. CNBC contacted Tractor Supply for more details about the changes, and the company declined to comment beyond the release.

The changes come amid a growing wave of anti-DEI sentiment in the wake of a U.S. Supreme Court decision in 2023 to strike down affirmative action in colleges. Experts at the time predicted the ruling could have implications for corporate hiring or recruiting.

Companies, including Starbucks , Disney and Target , have faced legal challenges over DEI initiatives for LGBTQ customers and employees. In February 2023, pharmaceutical giant Pfizer dropped race-based eligibility requirements for a fellowship program designed for college students of Black, Latino and Native American descent, the Associated Press reported.","Shoppers are seen at the parking lot of a Tractor Supply Co. store near Bloomsburg.

2025 Rivian R1S Rivian

A Thursday investor event for Rivian Automotive that focused on cost-cutting efforts, efficiency gains and in-house technologies and software wasn't enough to build on the company's significant share growth this week. Shares of the all-electric vehicle startup fell by about 2% to 6% for much of the event, eating into some of its 23% gain in shares the day before on news of an up to $5 billion investment by Volkswagen Group . Rivian's stock closed Thursday down 1.8% to $14.47 per share, off by roughly 39% year to date amid investor concerns regarding cash burn and a slowdown in EV sales. Rivian on Thursday reconfirmed its 2024 guidance that included production of 57,000 vehicles and a path to positive gross profit during the fourth quarter, including regulatory credits. It also outlined longer-term growths, such as plans to achieve positive adjusted earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization in 2027. ""Everything that you're hearing from us, around our product, around how we're running the business, around how we're driving toward profitability, my hope is that you're seeing really an extreme sense of urgency,"" Rivian CEO RJ Scaringe said during the event. ""We're very, very fast driving towards the improvements necessary to get to positive free cash flow and, before that, positive margins this year.""

Stock Chart Icon Stock chart icon Rivian's stock performance

Rivian also outlined long-term financial targets of a roughly 25% gross margin, 10% free cash flow and adjusted profit margin in the ""high teens."" The company did not release a time frame for these targets. Scaringe spent much of his time during the roughly four-hour presentation discussing efficiencies in products and manufacturing, which he said are expected to lead to 20% material cost reductions in its current vehicles, followed by 45% targeted reductions in its upcoming ""R2"" vehicles, which are projected to begin production in early 2026. The reductions range from physical savings, such as a 54% decrease in design costs of its R2 vehicles compared with current models, to lower costs on more complex systems such as battery packs and electrical hardware. For example, the company is using 10 fewer in-house electronic control units, or ECUs, in its recently redesigned R1 vehicles, allowing it to remove 1.6 miles in wiring harness length and 44 pounds out of the vehicle. Rivian's software expertise is at the center of VW's plans to invest $5 billion in the automaker by 2026, including an anticipated joint venture between the companies to create electrical architecture and software technology. Volkswagen is expected to use Rivian's electrical architecture and software stack for vehicles beginning in the second half of the decade, Scaringe said during the investment announcement. He said the joint venture does not include anything with battery technologies, vehicle propulsion platforms, high voltage systems or autonomy and electrical hardware.

CNBC,https://www.cnbc.com/2024/06/27/walgreens-wba-earnings-q3-2024.html,2024-06-27,20:35:07 UTC,Walgreens stock plunges as drugstore chain slashes profit guidance in 'challenging' consumer environment,"Shares of Walgreens closed more than 20% lower on Thursday after the company reported fiscal third-quarter earnings that fell short of expectations and slashed its full-year adjusted profit outlook, citing a ""challenging"" environment for pharmacies and U.S. consumers.

The retail pharmacy giant now expects fiscal 2024 adjusted earnings of $2.80 to $2.95 per share. That compares with the company's previous outlook of between $3.20 and $3.35 per share.

""'We assumed ... in the second half that the consumer would get somewhat stronger"" but ""that is not the case,"" Walgreens CEO Tim Wentworth told CNBC.

He added that ""the consumer is absolutely stunned by the absolute prices of things, and the fact that some of them may not be inflating doesn't actually change their resistance to the current pricing. So we've had to get really keen, particularly in discretionary things.""

Still, Walgreens topped revenue estimates for the quarter on strong performance in its health-care segment. The company views that business division as critical to its ongoing push to transform from a major drugstore chain into a large health-care company.

The results come as Walgreens works to slash costs after a rocky last year marked by low pharmacy reimbursement rates, weakening demand for Covid products and a challenging macroeconomic environment.

The company on Friday said it is simplifying its U.S. health-care portfolio and finalizing plans to close underperforming U.S. stores over multiple years, among other ongoing cost-cutting efforts.

""Seventy-five percent of our stores drive 100% of our profitability today,"" Wentworth said. ""What that means is the others we take a hard look at, we are going to finalize a number that we will close.""

Here's what Walgreens reported for the three-month period ended May 31 compared with what Wall Street was expecting, based on a survey of analysts by LSEG:

Earnings per share: 63 cents adjusted vs. 68 cents expected

63 cents adjusted vs. 68 cents expected Revenue: $36.4 billion vs. $35.94 billion expected

Walgreens booked sales of $36.4 billion for the quarter, up 2.6% from the same period a year ago.

The company reported net income of $344 million, or 40 cents per share, for the quarter. That compares with net income of $118 million, or 14 cents per share, for the same period a year ago.

Excluding certain items, adjusted earnings were 63 cents per share for the quarter.

Walgreens did not provide a new revenue forecast for the fiscal year. The company has not offered that guidance since October, when it said it expected $141 billion to $145 billion in sales.","Shares of Walgreens closed more than 20% lower on Thursday after the company reported fiscal third-quarter earnings that fell short of expectations and slashed its full-year adjusted profit outlook, citing a ""challenging"" environment for pharmacies and U.S. consumers.

CNBC,https://www.cnbc.com/2024/06/26/levi-levi-earnings-q2-2024.html,2024-06-27,09:17:32 UTC,Levi's shares drop 15% as jeans maker's sales disappoint despite denim craze,"Denim is having a moment with consumers, but it hasn't led to a major sales boost at Levi Strauss .

The jeans creator on Wednesday posted fiscal second-quarter revenue that fell just short of Wall Street's expectations at a time when shoppers are stocking their wardrobes with denim dresses, skirts and ultra low-rise baggy pants.

Levi's posted better-than-expected earnings as its direct sales to consumers and cost cutting continue to bear fruit. The company raised its dividend by 8% to 13 cents per share, its first increase in six quarters.

Still, shares fell about 15% in extended trading.

Here's how Levi's performed during the quarter compared with what Wall Street was anticipating, based on a survey of analysts by LSEG:

Earnings per share: 16 cents adjusted vs. 11 cents expected

16 cents adjusted vs. 11 cents expected Revenue: $1.44 billion vs. $1.45 billion expected

The company's reported net income for the three-month period that ended May 26 was $18 million, or 4 cents per share, compared with a loss of $1.6 million, or zero cents a share, a year earlier. Excluding one-time items, Levi's posted earnings of $66 million, or 16 cents per share.

Sales rose to $1.44 billion, up about 8% from $1.34 billion a year earlier. However, the sales jump was coming off of an easier comparison.

In the year-ago period, sales were down 9% after Levi's shifted its wholesale shipments from its fiscal second quarter into its fiscal first quarter. The shift reduced sales last year by about $100 million, the company said previously. Excluding the shift, as well as the exit of Levi's Denizen business, sales would have been up by only about 1% in its most recent quarter compared to the year-ago period.

Finance chief Harmit Singh attributed the sales miss to unfavorable foreign exchange conditions and weak sales at Docker's. During the quarter, the khaki and chinos brand saw $82.4 million in sales, up 8.6% from $75.8 million in the year ago period. It's not clear how sales at Docker's were affected by the timing of Levi's wholesale orders.

""People are generally cautious,"" Singh told CNBC in an interview. ""It's not necessarily an environment where people are buying a lot, people are cautious.""

While Levi's posted a strong earnings beat, it only reaffirmed its full-year guidance, which was in line with estimates. The company continues to expect full-year earnings per share to be between $1.17 and $1.27, which now includes a 5-cent hit coming from the company's new distribution and logistics strategy.

Levi's said it is transitioning from a primarily owned-and-operated distribution and logistics network in the U.S. and Europe to one that relies more on third parties.

""In the near term, these changes require the parallel operation of new and old facilities for the rest of 2024, resulting in a transitory increase in distribution costs,"" the company said.

The change allows Levi's to shift the responsibility of final mile delivery to third parties. The denim maker noted that it has new terms with its supplier that result in Levi's taking ownership of inventory closer to the point of shipment rather than its eventual destination. Levi's distribution network was built for a business that primarily sold to wholesalers, and now it needs to change into one that's more focused on selling directly to consumers.

The changes are necessary because nearly half of Levi's sales these days are coming from its own website and stores.

Direct-to-consumer sales jumped 8% during the quarter, representing 47% of overall sales. Online sales increased 19%.

""Our transformational pivot to operating as a DTC-first company is yielding positive results around the world, giving me great confidence that we will achieve accelerated, profitable growth for the rest of the year and beyond,"" CEO Michelle Gass said in a statement.

During the quarter, wholesale revenue grew 7%, but excluding the shift in timing of wholesale orders, sales in the channel decreased 4%. Singh noted that wholesale revenue improved on a sequential basis, but the company has a ""conservative"" view of the channel's growth moving forward.

By building out its own direct channels, Levi's enjoys higher profits, better data on its consumers and less reliance on shaky wholesalers like Macy's and Kohl's, which are continuing to shrink and fall out of favor with consumers.

However, selling directly can also be more expensive, and can come with unexpected hiccups that can impact sales and drain profits. For example, when someone buys a pair of Levi's from Macy's and wants to return them, Macy's typically bears that cost. Under a direct model, that responsibility, including the cost and logistics, would fall on Levi's.

Nike has come to be known as a cautionary tale for retailers long reliant on wholesalers that try to expand direct sales.

For a while, Nike's focus on direct sales boosted revenue and profits, but some critics said the strategy shift led to a slowdown in innovation, and ultimately, market share losses.

Recently, the company acknowledged that it erred when it cut off so many of its wholesale partners and said it has since ""corrected"" that.

It's been almost 20 years since the founding of Alphabet's YouTube, and Hollywood still doesn't really know what to do with it. YouTube, which effectively invented user-generated content, claims a daunting share of overall media consumption. And it's no longer just dominating the internet, it's dominating the living room, too. YouTube made up 9.7% of all viewership on connected and traditional TVs in the U.S. in May — the largest share of TV for a streaming platform ever reported by Nielsen's monthly ""The Gauge"" report. Netflix ranked second, claiming 7.6% of viewership. Among streamers only, YouTube's total viewership was close to 25% market share. ""We're not talking about your mobile phone, your laptop, that I'm sure you see your kids using all the time, but on the biggest screen in the house, the TV,"" said LightShed media analyst Rich Greenfield. ""Every [media] executive has to be paying attention."" But media companies such as Netflix, Disney and Warner Bros. Discovery aren't sure whether YouTube is friend or foe. Some media executives see YouTube as a companion platform to subscription streaming services and cable TV — an unwieldy behemoth of non-narrative, creator-led content with a social media slant that doesn't really fit the New York-Hollywood nexus of professional media. Others — even at times the same executives — view YouTube as an existential threat to the entertainment industry, stealing viewership from subscription streaming services and, with it, the cultural center of American youth. Those competing truths have led media and entertainment companies to concoct a wide array of strategies to combat the growing threat. Disney leaders discuss YouTube ""every day"" in strategic meetings and have considered adding user-generated content to Disney+, though it's not on the immediate roadmap, according to people familiar with the matter, who asked not to be named because the discussions are private. Netflix and Warner Bros. Discovery, on the other hand, have consciously chosen to focus on the other 90% of the TV viewing world that isn't YouTube. ""I do think it snuck up on people that YouTube was as important a presence in people's lives and people's viewing experiences not just on the phone but in the living room,"" said Tara Walpert Levy, YouTube's vice president of Americas, in an interview. ""When Nielsen first noted that YouTube was winning the streaming wars in terms of viewing, full stop, not just for ad-supported platforms, I had a ton of my friends from advertising, from media, who were like, 'Can you believe it?' It exceeded even our expectations,"" she said.

YouTube's growing dominance

Earlier this year, YouTube Chief Executive Officer Neal Mohan announced that users watch more than 1 billion hours of YouTube content on TV screens each day. More than 150 million Americans watch YouTube on connected TVs each month, according to the company. Ad dollars have followed. In 2023, YouTube took in $31.5 billion in advertising revenue, up 8% from 2022 and 271% from six years ago. In the first quarter of 2024, YouTube's ad revenue climbed 21% from a year earlier to $8.1 billion. YouTube, founded in 2005, sold to Google for $1.65 billion a year later. It's since ballooned in size as advertisers flocked to the platform. MoffettNathanson media analyst Michael Nathanson estimated in March that YouTube would be worth a whopping $400 billion as a standalone company — more than Disney and Comcast combined. ""YouTube is still the 800-pound gorilla in this space, and I do believe they're a pretty unstoppable juggernaut,"" said Candle Media co-CEO Kevin Mayer, who previously ran Disney's streaming business and was briefly CEO of TikTok.

Disney's YouTube focus

Disney executives are particularly attuned to YouTube's rising dominance, given its grip on younger people, according to people familiar with the company's thinking. Disney has a legion of super-fans who flock to YouTube and other social media sites to promote and critique its parks, rides and merchandise, movies and TV shows. Integrating some of that content as shoulder programming to Disney's scripted series and movies could help keep users on Disney+. A Disney spokesperson declined to comment on conversations about adding original content to the platform. The company claims 11.4% of TV viewership, according to Nielsen's ""The Gauge"" report, when adding up cable and streaming, including Hulu and ESPN.

You're betraying your audience. You're leaving YouTube to act, and then you're not posting online anymore, and you're asking them to wait on a project that's in development for what? A year, two years? People are going to forget about you, girl. That's how the internet works."" Brittany Broski YouTube creator

""I think what we're seeing from all of these traditional media companies is they don't have enough content, and it's too expensive to produce the types of premium content at scale that they need. And so maybe the [user-generated content] economy is a place they look ... not to create their competitor, but as a lower cost way to add content to their services,"" said LightShed's Greenfield. Disney is also considering putting more full episodes of Disney+ and Hulu series geared to older kids and adults directly on YouTube to entice an audience that isn't currently subscribing to its streaming platforms, said a person familiar with the matter. This is a strategy Disney has done with kids content for years, helping amplify hit animated series such as ""Bluey,"" ""Spidey and his Amazing Friends"" and ""Mickey Mouse Clubhouse.""

""At the end of the day, Disney is a storytelling machine,"" said Mayer. ""We used short-form video on YouTube as a promotional device for our content. But I don't think that we at Disney, nor have any other traditional media companies, leaned into YouTube as an original storytelling device the way they probably should have."" According to internal research, Disney executives concluded that younger Americans use YouTube as an online encyclopedia, said one of the people familiar with the company's discussions. That's led the company to focus on the benefits of the platform's discovery functionality while also programming against it, the person said. Disney has made bespoke YouTube content for its new preschool series ""Disney Junior's Ariel,"" which debuts June 27, to introduce the mermaid character to kids. It has also developed a series of ""Winnie the Pooh"" shorts so that it can research how the animated bear and his friends resonate with today's youth. The company is now considering making a full-length animated series on ""Winnie the Pooh"" based on the short-form video data, the person said.

Netflix's muted response

Netflix is taking on YouTube from a different angle. It doesn't view the platform as the same singular threat to viewership that some of its peers do. Netflix famously considers everything that could occupy a user's time, even sleep, as a long-term competitor. For the time being, Netflix executives consider YouTube as catering to a different consumer need. ""We have built a hard-to-replicate combination of a strong slate, superior recommendations, broad reach and intense fandom, which drives healthy engagement on Netflix. Improvement in these key areas is the best way to delight our members and continue to grow our business,"" Netflix said in its most recent quarterly shareholder letter. Netflix has even found some success duplicating content on YouTube in specific instances. ""Cocomelon,"" the animated toddler-geared short-form video series owned by Candle Media's Moonbug Entertainment, has become massively popular on both YouTube and Netflix. ""Cocomelon"" has 175 million subscribers to its English language YouTube channel, and ""many more if you add in all languages,"" Mayer said. At the same time, ""Cocomelon"" frequently tops Netflix's most-watched list among kids shows.

Posters showing ""Blippi"" and ""Cocomelon"" characters are displayed at the Moonbug Entertainment stand during the Brand Licensing Europe event at ExCel, in London, Oct. 04, 2023. John Keeble | Getty Images

The more immediate YouTube threat for Netflix comes from an advertising perspective. Netflix is now going head-to-head with YouTube for marketing dollars after introducing its ad-supported tier in November 2022. Netflix said in May that it has 40 million global monthly active users for its advertising tier. That's a far cry from YouTube's more than 2 billion monthly active users. Netflix is even contemplating launching free versions of its service in certain international markets to court advertisers, though there's nothing concrete planned, Bloomberg reported earlier this week. Netflix declined to comment for this story.

Other strategies

Comcast -owned NBCUniversal has experimented with new ways to copy the rabbit-hole effect of YouTube Shorts, which force-feed users content based on interest, by offering curated clips of ""Saturday Night Live"" sketches, scenes from ""The Office"" or favorite Bravo show moments. If younger users are being conditioned to watch in a certain way, NBCUniversal's Peacock streaming service wants to give consumers that choice in addition to its long-form movies and TV shows. But simply curating feeds within a content vertical now feels like a ""YouTube 1.0 strategy"" given how TikTok, YouTube Shorts and Instagram Reels have redefined short-form viewing, according to Nathanson. ""I don't think, at this point, there's a strategy in place among any of the traditional media players to create content for the YouTube generation that's more than just their branded strategy they're doing now,"" said Nathanson. ""The future strategy is to use AI to deliver personalization for each of us. Today, none of the traditional media players has that. That's YouTube 2.0."" Amazon is trying a more direct plan of attack — pay YouTube's biggest star to make a show for their own service. The company announced a deal earlier this year with MrBeast, whose real name is Jimmy Donaldson, to make a reality TV show, ""Beast Games,"" that will pay the winner $5 million in cash. The format will largely borrow from previous MrBeast giveaway videos that pit many contestants against each other for cash, using a ""fast-paced and high-production format,"" as Amazon has promised.

MrBeast's YouTube channel has the most subscribers worldwide at 289 million and expects to take in a whopping $700 million in revenue in 2024, primarily through advertising and brand deals. But while MrBeast may have crossover appeal, there's skepticism among creators that YouTube celebrities will have success making shows for subscription streaming services. Moreover, the entire Hollywood system may operate too slowly for a younger generation that demands immediate content.

YouTube's community

The popularity of YouTube stems from the authentic relationship creators have with their fans, according to Brittany Broski, 27, whose YouTube channel has more than 2 million subscribers. ""I still watch Netflix and HBO, where if I want a good fantasy series or whatever, I know where to go for that. But what YouTube is more concerned with is in this digital age, we've lost a sense of community and a sense of third spaces where we can go to hang out and meet new friends,"" Broski said. Broski's audience, which she described as Generation Z and young millennial women and members of the LGBTQ+ community, ballooned during the pandemic. Stuck at home with limited social options, hundreds of thousands of people found Broski as they searched for fresh, real-time content. That personal relationship is YouTube's secret sauce, and it doesn't translate when creators port to other services, Broski said. ""You're betraying your audience,"" said Broski. ""You're leaving YouTube to act, and then you're not posting online anymore, and you're asking them to wait on a project that's in development for what? A year, two years? People are going to forget about you, girl. That's how the internet works.""

Brittany Broski at VidCon 2022 in Anaheim, California, June 23, 2022. David Livingston | Getty Images Entertainment | Getty Images

The business model of YouTube for successful creators incentivizes staying on the platform. YouTube has shared more than $70 billion with its creators over the last three years through its Partner Program, which shares advertising revenue with more than 3 million channels on the platform. ""Why would I create a show and sell it to a network when I could just put it on YouTube?"" Broski said. ""You're self-funding, but if the money you're making from AdSense is going right back into your content to make more money, why do you even have to contact that third party?"" YouTube also benefits from a low barrier to entry to create content and from instant feedback through comments from fans that often help shape future content immediately. That model can't be replicated in a scripted form, where full seasons of TV shows are premade and rolled out on specific schedules. ""In the traditional industry, it's about proving to other people that the content deserves to be made, deserves to be seen, deserves a marketing campaign, deserves dollars behind it,"" said YouTube star and former professional cyclist Michelle Khare, 31, whose channel has more than 4.5 million subscribers. ""With YouTube, if you have the drive, the ability, and in many cases, your phone, you can skip those steps and put it out into a democratic platform where the audience ultimately decides what rises to the top.""

The stock pared losses slightly to trade down 13% by 9:00 a.m. London time.

The world's second largest retailer said operating profit for the period between March and May came in at 7.1 billion Swedish kroner ($672 million), below the 7.37 billion Swedish kroner anticipated by analysts, according to an LSEG poll cited by Reuters.

The second-quarter result was nevertheless above the 4.7 billion Swedish kroner recorded in the same period last year.

The company also said that bad weather was likely to dampen sales in June, which it expects to decline by 6% in local currencies, compared with the same period of last year.

Further weighing on stock, H&M CEO Daniel Ervér cast doubt over the company's ability to meet its margin target this year.

""Our goal of an operating margin of 10 percent for full-year 2024 remains in place,"" he said. ""However, the conditions for achieving that level this year have become more challenging as it is assessed that external factors that influence our purchasing costs and sales revenues, including materials and foreign currency, will have a more negative impact than we expected in the second half of the year.""

He added that the company was continuing to invest in both its online and in store experiences, with upgrades to stores in Paris, Milan, Berlin, Stockholm, Hamburg and Munich to follow those already undertaken in New York, London and Tokyo.

It comes as higher living costs and a slowdown in post-pandemic spending have weighed on both high street and luxury retail sales.

Earlier this month, Zara owner Inditex reported a slowdown in first-quarter sales compared to the previous year's growth, but pointed to an uptick in May.

Meanwhile, Chinese-founded fast fashion giant Shein has been encroaching on European retailers, as it prepares for a public listing in London.","Shares of H&M plunged more than 14% on Thursday morning after the company reported a smaller-than-expected increase in second-quarter profits and cast doubt over its June sales and full-year profit margin target.

In a lyric on her latest album, Beyoncé sings ""denim on denim, on denim, on denim."" Levi Strauss shoppers are taking that advice to heart. Levi Strauss executives are ecstatic. Western wear is booming as consumers opt for top-to-bottom denim looks, the iconic, 171-year-old clothing maker said on Wednesday. As the style wins cultural favor, its popularity is juicing denim niches — like shirts, skirts and dresses — that fall outside Levi's widely-known blue jean offerings. ""The growing popularity of Western wear is at an all-time high,"" CEO Michelle Gass told analysts Wednesday night after the California-based retailer's latest earnings report for the quarter ended in May. A Western renaissance has been gaining traction over the past several months, sending stylish shoppers searching for pieces like jeans, boots and cowboy hats. Levi's scored a huge hit when its jean brand was referenced in Beyoncé's song ""Levii's Jeans,"" released earlier this year. Beyond Beyoncé's chart-topping ""Cowboy Carter"" album, the increased ubiquity of Western style has also been tied to a fashion line unveiled by Louis Vuitton earlier this year and Taylor Swift's ongoing Eras Tour.

Gass, who took over as Levi Strauss CEO earlier this year after previously serving as the CEO at Kohl's , has touted that denim is having a moment in the popular imagination, with Western wear trending more broadly throughout the culture. More specific data shared on the company's earnings call Wednesday showed how Levi Strauss is taking advantage of demand for denim beyond its popular ""501"" jeans. Sales of denim skirts, jumpsuits and dresses all at least doubled in the latest quarter, Gass said. Western shirts sales are also up significantly, she said, especially on the women's side. Levi is find success in what the 55-year-old chief executive described as a new strategy of trying to dress customers denim — from head-to-toe. ""Our new focus is, yes, continuing to own jeans, but taking that denim top to bottom,"" Gass said on CNBC's ""Mad Money"" late Wednesday. While noting that the denim skirt and dress categories haven't been historically large for the company, now ""they're exploding,"" she said.

Denim rage sets a high bar on Wall Street

To be sure, the well-documented denim craze alone isn't necessarily impressing Wall Street. Levi Strauss tumbled more than 15% on Thursday in response to its latest numbers, its second worst day since going public in early 2019. Levi Strauss posted $1.44 billion in revenue in the fiscal second quarter, slightly missing the $1.45 billion consensus forecast of analysts polled by LSEG despite the denim boom. The company's finance chief told CNBC that the sales miss was driven by unfavorable foreign exchange rates and weakness in the Dockers brand. On the other hand, Levi Strauss earned 16 cents per share, excluding items, ahead of the 11-cent average estimate by analysts. In the year through Wednesday, shares had run up amid the buzz around the cotton-based fabric and the resurgence of Western clothing. Following Thursday's drop, the stock is still up more than 18% on the year. For comparison, shares of Kontoor Brands , the parent of denim brands Wrangler and Lee, have risen 5% year to date.

CNBC,https://www.cnbc.com/2024/06/28/may-pce-inflation-report.html,2024-06-28,19:35:23 UTC,"Key Fed measure shows inflation rose 2.6% in May from a year ago, as expected","Including food and energy, headline inflation was flat on the month and also up 2.6% on an annual basis. Those readings also were in line with expectations.

Both numbers were in line with the Dow Jones estimates. May marked the lowest annual rate since March 2021, which was the first time in this economic cycle that inflation topped the Fed's 2% target.

The core personal consumption expenditures price index increased just a seasonally adjusted 0.1% for the month and was up 2.6% from a year ago, the latter number down 0.2 percentage point from the April level, according to a Commerce Department report .

An important economic measure for the Federal Reserve showed Friday that inflation during May slowed to its lowest annual rate in more than three years.

""It is just additional news that monetary policy is working, inflation is gradually cooling,"" San Francisco Fed President Mary Daly told CNBC's Andrew Ross Sorkin during a ""Squawk Box"" interview. ""That's a relief for businesses and households who've been struggling with persistently high inflation. It's good news for how policy is working.""

The Fed focuses on the PCE inflation reading as opposed to the more widely followed consumer price index from the Labor Department's Bureau of Labor Statistics. PCE is a broader inflation measure and accounts for changes in consumer behavior, such as substituting their purchases when prices rise.

While the central bank officially follows headline PCE, officials generally stress the core reading as a better gauge of longer-term inflation trends.

Outside of the inflation numbers, the Bureau of Economic Analysis report showed that personal income rose 0.5% on the month, stronger than the 0.4% estimate. Consumer spending, however, increased 0.2%, weaker than the 0.3% forecast.

Prices were held in check during the month by a 0.4% decline for goods and a 2.1% slide in energy, which offset a 0.2% increase in services and a 0.1% gain for food.

However, housing prices continued to rise, up 0.4% on the month for the fourth straight time. Shelter-related costs have proven stickier than Federal Reserve officials have anticipated and have helped keep the central bank from reducing interest rates as expected this year.

Stock market futures were modestly positive following the report while Treasury yields were negative on the session.

Investors have been trying to handicap the Fed's intentions on rates this year and have had to scale back expectations. Whereas traders earlier in 2024 had been expecting at least six rate cuts this year they are now pricing in just two, starting in September. Fed officials at their June meeting penciled in just one reduction this year.

""The lack of surprise in today's PCE number is a relief and will be welcomed by the Fed,"" said Seema Shah, chief global strategist at Principal Asset Management. ""However, the policy path is not yet certain. A further deceleration in inflation, ideally coupled with additional evidence of labor market softening, will be necessary to pave the way for a first rate cut in September.""

The Fed targets 2% inflation and began raising interest rates in March 2022 after a year of dismissing rising prices as transitory effects from the Covid pandemic that likely would fade. The central bank last raised rates in July 2023 after taking its benchmark overnight borrowing level to a range of 5.25%-5.50%, the highest in some 23 years.

Recent economic data has painted a picture of an economy that has withstood the Fed's aggressive monetary tightening. Gross domestic product rose at a 1.4% annualized rate in the first quarter and is on pace to increase 2.2% in the second quarter, according to the Atlanta Fed.

There have been some slight cracks in the labor market lately, with continuing jobless claims hitting their highest level since November 2021. However, the unemployment rate is still 4%, low by historical means though also rising at a slow pace.","Including food and energy, headline inflation was flat on the month and also up 2.6% on an annual basis.

CNBC,https://www.cnbc.com/2024/06/30/top-wall-street-analysts-favor-these-dividend-stocks-for-better-returns.html,2024-06-30,10:55:21 UTC,Top Wall Street analysts favor these dividend stocks for better returns,"A sign is posted in front of an Olive Garden restaurant on June 20, 2024 in Rohnert Park, California.

Dividend-paying stocks can help investors bolster their portfolios and boost returns.

Investors searching for these names will need to find companies that have a track record of making steady payments, backed by robust financials.

Here are three attractive dividend stocks, according to Wall Street's top pros on TipRanks, a platform that ranks analysts based on their past performance.

Darden Restaurants

The first dividend stock is Darden Restaurants (DRI), which operates several popular brands in full-service dining, including Olive Garden, LongHorn Steakhouse and Yard House. The company recently announced mixed results for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2024. While Darden exceeded analysts' earnings expectations, its sales slightly missed the Street's consensus amid increased discounting by rivals.

Darden issued $628 million in dividends and committed $454 million to share repurchases in fiscal 2024. Moreover, the company announced a dividend hike of nearly 7%, bringing the quarterly dividend to $1.40 per share. The stock has a dividend yield of 3.5%.

Following the results, BTIG analyst Peter Saleh reiterated a buy rating on DRI stock with a price target of $175. The analyst highlighted that at the mid-point, Darden's earnings per share outlook of $9.40 to $9.60 indicates double-digit total shareholder return, which is in line with the company's long-term targets.

Saleh thinks that the company can achieve its targeted return metrics, supported by several factors, including a modest rise in pricing, advertising initiatives and easing inflation.

""We view Darden Restaurants as one of the strongest operators in the industry with historical sales and restaurant margin performance that has consistently exceeded peers,"" said Saleh.

Saleh ranks No. 360 among more than 8,900 analysts tracked by TipRanks. His ratings have been successful 61% of the time, with each delivering an average return of 11.7%. (See Darden's Financial Statements on TipRanks)

International Seaways

Next up is International Seaways (INSW), a tanker company that offers energy transportation services for crude oil and petroleum products. On June 26, the company paid a combined dividend of $1.75 per share. The company's combined dividend represented 60% of its first-quarter adjusted net income.

In its first-quarter results, INSW highlighted that its combined dividend payments of $5.74 per share over the last twelve months reflected a dividend yield of more than 13%.

Following meetings with INSW's management, Stifel analyst Benjamin Nolan reaffirmed a buy rating on the stock and increased the price target to $68 from $66. The analyst noted that the tanker market remains cyclically strong due to a continued increase in global oil consumption, the limited supply of new ships and the longer average voyage lengths caused by the ongoing geopolitical troubles.

Accordingly, Nolan increased his rate assumptions for 2024 and 2025. The analyst expects International Seaways to continue to deliver higher cash flows, fueled by a favorable backdrop for the tanker market.

Nolan expects INSW to sustain high supplemental dividends, given the estimated $200 million to $300 million of excess cash flow after capital expenditure (assuming there is no new debt associated with tanker acquisitions). ""We are modeling $5.51/share in 2024 dividends, although there is room to be a little higher,"" said the analyst.

Nolan ranks No. 68 among more than 8,900 analysts tracked by TipRanks. His ratings have been successful 67% of the time, with each delivering an average return of 19.5%. (See International Seaways' Stock Charts on TipRanks)

Citigroup

Finally, let's discuss this week's third dividend stock, banking giant Citigroup (C). At a quarterly dividend of 53 cents per share, Citigroup offers a yield of 3.3%.

The bank held its Services Investor Day on June 18. Management expressed confidence about achieving the 2024 guidance, driven by revenue growth across all the core businesses despite macro uncertainty and the possibility of lower interest rates.

Following the event, Goldman Sachs analyst Richard Ramsden reiterated a buy rating on Citigroup stock and slightly raised his price target to $72 from $71. The higher price target reflects an increase in the analyst's EPS estimates for 2024, 2025 and 2026 based on management's commentary, which indicated that the bank's strategic transformation plan is gaining momentum.

Ramsden noted that Citi is highly focused on its transformation efforts, with the bank making steady progress on risk control and data quality. Coming to the Services business, the analyst noted that management established strategic priorities for this vital component of the company's financial targets. The analyst estimates that the Services business will account for 25% of the group revenue growth through 2026.

""The Services business is well positioned to maintain their market leading positions with potential to continue share gains across businesses,"" said Ramsden. The analyst's optimism is based on Citi's extensive global network in 95 countries, well-established long-term client relationships, and market share gains that are expected to be driven by investments in technology and innovative offerings.

Ramsden ranks No. 969 among more than 8,900 analysts tracked by TipRanks. His ratings have been successful 65% of the time, with each delivering an average return of 11.9%.

CNBC,https://www.cnbc.com/2024/06/29/two-paths-for-jana-to-bolster-shareholder-value-at-rapid7.html,2024-06-29,11:55:40 UTC,Activist Jana has a stake in Rapid7. There are two paths to bolster value at the cybersecurity company,"Business: Rapid7 is a global cybersecurity software and services provider. Its products span across information security, cloud operations, development and information technology teams, enabling them to understand attackers and leverage that information to take control of their fragmented attack surface. Rapid7 Managed Threat Complete is the company's flagship offering, and it includes the Rapid7 Managed Detection and Response program. Rapid7 also provides risk and threat coverage through InsightIDR and Insight VM services, making them available in a single package. Its security solutions help more than 11,000 global customers unite cloud risk management and threat detection.

Activist Commentary: Jana is a very experienced activist investor founded in 2001 by Barry Rosenstein. The firm made its name taking deeply researched activist positions with well-conceived plans for long term value. Rosenstein called his activist strategy ""V cubed."" The three ""Vs"" were"" (i) Value: buying at the right price; (ii) Votes: knowing whether you have the votes before commencing a proxy fight; and (iii) Variety of ways to win: having more than one strategy to enhance value and exit an investment. Since 2008, the firm has gradually shifted that strategy to one which we characterize as the three ""Ss"" (i) Stock price: buying at the right price; (ii) Strategic activism: sale of company or spinoff of a business; and (iii) Star advisors/nominees: aligning with top industry executives to advise them and take board seats if necessary.

Rapid7 is a cybersecurity company that expands the expertise of its clients' security operations. Its Managed Threat Complete flagship offering combines end-to-end 24/7 managed detection and response with vulnerability management offerings. Historically, the company has focused on on-site cybersecurity operations, but it has begun to expand into the explosive growth area of cloud security. Rapid7 operates in a highly attractive industry and is the beneficiary of some meaningful tailwinds. In a time where software budgets are being cut or reallocated toward AI, the threat of cyberattacks looms large and presents a great enough risk that spend is either flat or increasing for these types of services. In addition, cybersecurity analysts and internal security staff are limited, so there is a tremendous need for outsourcing. With more complex operations and numerous applications both on-site and in the cloud, Rapid7 is well-positioned to continue growing and aims to be a high-quality provider for subject matter experts who may not be able to retain the services of their largest and most expensive competitors.

Despite its favorable position, the company has delivered negative returns on a one-, three-, and five-year basis. Rapid7 is one of three main players in vulnerability management, yet it's assigned a much smaller revenue multiple (3x) compared to peers Tenable (5.5x) and Qualys (8x). One factor in this is that Rapid7 offers a combination of low- and high-growth cybersecurity offerings, which is difficult to value, but more important are the multiple slip-ups by management, exacerbated by a lack of oversight by the board. First, the company has undergone changes to its sales model, including a shift to selling packaged products from selling offerings individually. It's also moved to a channel model from direct. Next, the company has encountered challenges in bringing its cloud product to market. In addition, to shift from pure growth to a profitable software company, Rapid7 has focused on meeting targets for $160 million in free cash flow and improved margins. In August 2023, likely in pursuit of these goals, the company abruptly announced plans to reduce its staff by 18%. Rapid7 has had further retention problems in key executive roles, including the departure of its chief innovation officer and its critically important chief operating officer and president. Finally, the company has not been able to properly make forecasts, leading to tremendous investor uncertainty and questions of board oversight. In February 2024, the company announced its 2024 guidance, which it stated it was highly confident in, only to cut it in May when the company delivered its Q1 results. That led to a 17% stock price decline on May 8. This is a company operating in a highly complex and dynamic space – it is doing everything all at once and has seemingly failed to deliver.

With a company like this, there are generally two paths to shareholder value creation: (i) a long-term plan involving board reconstitution, management overhaul and review of strategic and operational plans and (ii) a shorter-term plan to sell the company to an interested buyer who can make those changes. With respect to the long-term plan, Jana generally works with industry executives and consultants in performing due diligence and implementing its activist plans, and we do not expect this situation to be different. The firm will often bring these individuals to the table to serve as director nominees, if deemed necessary. Jana is experienced in getting these experts on company boards, where they often serve as assets in getting the company to correct its issues, from operational to governance to capital allocation. But Jana also has extensive experience in strategic activism and getting portfolio companies sold. We expect that Jana will advocate for the strategy it expects will maximize shareholder value on a risk- and time-adjusted basis. Given the problems the company has been experiencing and the lack of CEO focus (Aside from being chairman and CEO of Rapid7, Corey Thomas is on the National Security Telecommunications Advisory Committee, chair of the Federal Reserve Bank of Boston and a member of the Council on Foreign Relations. He also serves on the boards of the Blue Cross Blue Shield of Massachusetts, LPL Financial and Vanderbilt University.), a sale looks like it could be the easier and more certain path if there is a suitor at the right price.

Given industry tailwinds, there may be several strategic and financial buyers interested in this company. Recent transactions in the cybersecurity sector include Cisco's $28 billion takeover of Splunk and Francisco Partners' $1.7 billion acquisition of Sumo Logic. If Jana does advocate for a sale of Rapid7, it will ask the board to do it through a full sales process that attains the highest value for shareholders. In addition, Jana has a strategic partnership with Cannae Holdings, which could be helpful in providing the equity in a strategic transaction with a private equity firm. Consider that in 2019, Cannae joined with private-equity firms to buy Dun & Bradstreet. It is important to note that even if Jana thinks a sale of the company is the best way to optimize shareholder value, the firm will still have to get the board to agree. This does not look like a board and management team that will just go quietly. In such a case, Jana's remedy would be to launch a proxy fight, but that could take some time. The 2024 annual meeting just passed on June 13 and the director nomination window does not open until Feb.13, 2025.

Now there's been a major revelation about how the Biden administration has pushed the transgender agenda when it comes to children.

According to the New York Times, Biden officials played a significant role in convincing an international pro-transgender medical group to remove age limits from its guidelines for trans surgeries.

""Email excerpts from members of the World Professional Association for Transgender Health (WPATH) recount how staff for Adm. Rachel Levine, assistant secretary for health at the Department of Health and Human Services and herself a transgender woman, urged them to drop the proposed limits from the group's guidelines and apparently succeeded,"" The Times reports.

The administration was reportedly concerned that age minimums would trigger political backlash that could fuel legislation opposing the trans ideology.

More than two dozen states now have laws restricting gender-altering medical experiments on the bodies of minors. And this week, the Supreme Court agreed to hear the Biden administration's challenge to one of those laws.

LATEST Supreme Court Takes up Hot Topic of Gender-Altering Procedures on Children

Critics say children are too young to make these irreversible, life-altering decisions while supporters claim that young people with gender dysphoria need the procedures right away.

But as CBN News reported earlier this year, U.S.-based think tank Environmental Progress reported that even the WPATH admitted behind closed doors that ""children and adolescents cannot comprehend the lifelong consequences of 'gender-affirming care,' and in some cases, due to poor health literacy, neither can their parents.""

MORE Leaked Files Reveal Major Risks with Transgender Experiments: 'It Is Not Medicine'

When we confronted WPATH about those claims, Marci Bowers, M.D., president of the group, told us in a statement, ""The world is not flat. Gender, like genitalia, is represented by diversity. The small percentage of the population that is trans or gender diverse deserves healthcare and will never be a threat to the global gender binary.""

Meanwhile, England and other European nations are backing away from transition procedures on minors after studies showed ""weak evidence"" that they lead to long-term positive impacts.

""This is one instance in which I think Europe is headed in the right direction,"" Sarah Parshall Perry of the Heritage Foundation told CBN's Wendy Griffith. ""In addition to that, we are now seeing Norway, Finland, Sweden, and now the most recent edition is Scotland who has backed off the use of chemical castration agents as well.""

There is also a growing number of people who regret undergoing gender transition and are seeking to revert back to their biological gender. They're warning distressed children and their families about rushing into life-altering medical decisions.

Fortune,https://fortune.com/europe/2024/07/02/air-france-klm-brace-for-a-multi-million-euro-hit-as-travelers-dodge-paris-olympic-disruptions/,2024-07-02,10:31:35 UTC,Air France-KLM brace for a multi-million euro hit as travelers dodge Paris due to Olympic disruptions,"Air France-KLM warned of a revenue shortfall at its French operations this summer because passengers are avoiding Paris to skirt possible disruptions and high prices during the Olympic Games.

The issues will curtail revenue at Air France and the French arm of the low-cost Transavia unit by between €160 million ($172 million) and €180 million from June to August, the carrier group said in a statement. French residents are postponing holidays until after the Olympics, while international customers are staying away, the company said.

Airlines have poured capacity into Paris in the run-up to the games, with Air France, Transavia and Ryanair Holdings Plc leading the charge. After the Olympics, Air France said it expects travel to and from France will likely go back to normal. It’s seeing “encouraging demand” for the end of August and for September, and won’t pull back on its schedule for now, it said.

While it’s typical for corporate travelers to avoid a host city during the Olympics, Air France-KLM’s warning was “more surprising on an aggregate basis,” Bernstein analyst Alex Irving said in a research note.

Shares of the Franco-Dutch carrier fell 1% as of 3:35 p.m. in Paris, amid gains for other French stocks after the far right recorded a smaller margin of victory than expected in weekend elections. Air France-KLM has declined 40% this year.

Collectively, the five biggest airlines are selling 1.35 million more round-trip tickets to Paris from July to September than they did last year, based on data from aviation analytics firm Cirium. More than half of that extra capacity has been added by Air France and Transavia.

Ryanair, meanwhile, accounts for much of the rest with a 25% increase compared with the third quarter of 2023, as the low-cost leader expands at Beauvais Airport north of Paris.","Air France-KLM warned of a revenue shortfall at its French operations this summer because passengers are avoiding Paris to skirt possible disruptions and high prices during the Olympic Games.

Fortune,https://fortune.com/2024/07/02/boeings-settlement-doj-sweetheart-deal-crash-victims-lawyer-what-to-know/,2024-07-02,10:04:51 UTC,Boeing’s potential settlement with the DOJ has been called a ‘sweetheart deal’ by a crash victims’ lawyer. Here’s what to know about it,"Federal prosecutors and victims’ families are waiting for Boeing to decide whether to accept a plea deal that would settle a criminal fraud charge accusing the aerospace giant of misleading regulators who approved the 737 Max jetliner before two of the planes crashed.

Relatives of some of the 346 people who died in the October 2018 and March 2019 crashes are furious about the plea offer, which Justice Department prosecutors spelled out in an online meeting with the families and their lawyers on Sunday.

The families want to put Boeing on trial.

“This package offers another opportunity for Boeing to hide their misdeeds from the public,” Ike Riffel, a Californian whose two sons died in the second 737 Max crash, said Monday. “The families are very disappointed, but we vow to fight on.”

Paul Cassell, a former federal judge who is representing some of the victims’ families, called it “a sweetheart deal” for Boeing.

Some of the lawyers involved in the case, however, say a plea deal is better than nothing.

“While I personally would have preferred a more vigorous prosecution, a guilty plea to a felony is a serious step up” from a 2021 agreement between Boeing and the Justice Department, said Mark Lindquist, a lawyer who is suing Boeing on behalf of passengers who survived a scary 737 Max inciden t at the beginning of this year.

The Justice Department first charged Boeing with fraud in January 2021 but agreed not to prosecute if the company paid a fine and followed other terms for three years. Then, seven weeks ago, the department said Boeing had violated the deferred prosecution agreement by failing to make changes to detect and prevent future violations of anti-fraud laws. Prosecutors have not publicly disclosed the alleged violations.

Here are some questions being asked about the case.

What is Boeing accused of?

The Justice Department wants Boeing to plead guilty to a single count of fraud for deceiving the Federal Aviation Administration about new flight-control software for the 737 Max and how much training pilots of older 737 models would need to safely fly the plane. In the 2021 settlement, Boeing blamed the deception on two low-level employees, one of whom was later acquitted after a trial in federal court.

Is Boeing likely to accept the plea offer?

The company isn’t saying. Lawyers for the victims’ families say the company would be crazy to reject it.

If Boeing takes the deal, it would plead guilty in what likely would be a very short court session. If it turns down the offer, the Justice Department is vowing to take the case to trial, which could expose more details of Boeing’s actions while it was asking the FAA to certify the Max.

Boeing “wouldn’t want that bad press and publicity that would come from a trial that would likely involve family members of victims testifying,” said Joseph Facciponti, executive director of New York University’s law school program on corporate compliance and enforcement. A judge might also impose a harder sentence if Boeing contested the case and lost, he added.

Can the judge block a plea deal?

Yes. The plea and the sentence outlined by the Justice Department, including a $244 million fine and appointment of a monitor to oversee the agreement, would be filed in U.S. District Court in Fort Worth, Texas. If Judge Reed O’Connor accepts the agreement, he could not change the terms approved by Boeing and prosecutors.

If the judge rejects a plea deal, Boeing and the Justice Department could negotiate a new agreement or go to trial.

Lawyers for the families say that if Boeing accepts the plea deal, they will ask O’Connor to reject it.

Would a guilty plea lead to more civil lawsuits against Boeing?

It would strengthen the hand of victims’ families who have not settled their pending lawsuits against the company. It is less clear whether survivors and heirs who already accepted settlements could file new claims.

Does the plea offer affect other investigations into Boeing?

It would only resolve the fraud charge filed after the two deadly crashes, which took place off the coast of Indonesia and in Ethiopia.

The Justice Department opened another investigation after a panel covering an unused emergency exit blew off a 737 Max during an Alaska Airlines flight in January; the FBI told passengers on that flight they might be victims of a crime. The National Transportation Safety Board and Federal Aviation Administration are conducting separate investigations into the blowout and Boeing’s manufacturing quality.

Will Boeing’s purchase of a key supplier improve safety?

Boeing announced Monday that it will pay $4.7 billion in stock to acquire Spirit AeroSystems, which makes fuselages for the 737 Max. Boeing once owned Spirit, and it believes that bringing the supplier back in-house will help it improve quality and ease safety concerns about its planes.

Manufacturing mistakes by suppliers can turn up in finished products. The Alaska Airlines blowout occurred after bolts were not reinstalled following a repair job at Boeing — workers had to fix rivets that were damaged when the fuselage arrived from Spirit — according to a preliminary report by the NTSB.

What are other potential implications of a Boeing plea?

A criminal conviction can jeopardize a company’s standing as a federal contractor, and Boeing is an important one. The company builds planes for the Defense Department and built a space capsule for NASA.

Facciponti, the NYU expert on corporate law, said the plea could be written so that a Boeing subsidiary pleads guilty, allowing the rest of the company to avoid disbarment. However, in many cases agencies have discretion to avoid disbarring companies.

“I don’t think the government wants to lose the ability to contract with Boeing, so there is always the option for government agencies to allow a company that has been convicted of a crime like this to continue doing business with them,” Facciponti said.

The Boeing case also raises questions about deferred prosecution agreements.

Peter Reilly, a law professor at Texas A&M University who has written about them, said DPAs were intended to handle low-level offenses and first-time offenders but are now used in major cases like the 2015 deal with General Motors, which was charged with concealing a deadly problem with ignition switches in small cars. Reilly said Congress should bar DPAs when victims of a corporate crime die.

“People are realizing, wow, this is what happens when Boeing admits to committing a very serious crime and 346 people die?” he said.","“The families are very disappointed, but we vow to fight on.”Paul Cassell, a former federal judge who is representing some of the victims’ families, called it “a sweetheart deal” for Boeing.

NSE data shows that foreign net portfolio flows to the bourse in June were, however, lower than May’s Sh1.49 billion—a pointer to some waned appetite among the investors.

The net purchases trend by the offshore investors nonetheless stood for a third month since April when they took up Sh1billion worth of stocks --signifying the return of the external investors to the bourse.

Foreigners remained buyers of locally listed stocks in June, representing the third straight month of purchases by offshore investors which affirms confidence in the domestic market.

The consecutive foreign inflows to the NSE mark the extended confidence in the market by foreigners who were previously sellers, with the exits being driven by concerns about foreign exchange availability and better returns from higher interest rates in advanced economies.

The raising of interest rates by the Central Bank of Kenya (CBK) has improved the attraction of the local market to foreigners, while the improvements in the exchange rate have provided liquidity for offshore investors, allowing them to enter and exit the market at will.

A stronger Kenyan shilling has moreover sweetened the deal for the foreigners with dollar returns from the NSE peaking at 63.44 percent as of the end of May allowing investors cashing out to get more dollars for the same value of stocks sold in local currency after the rally.

The dollar returns from Kenya on a year-to-date basis have outperformed the average return of 5.95 percent from frontier markets according to the Morgan Stanley Capital International (MSCI) index.

Foreigners portfolio flows into the NSE, so far in 2024, currently stand at Sh644.7 million factoring in selloffs seen in the first three months of the year before the shifting of the tide.

The local bourse has also benefited from the favourable reviews including the end of restrictions on the availability of foreign exchange by the MSCI and the FTSE Russell indexes.

Kenya had been placed under the watch of the two investor service providers in 2022, following reports of foreign investors facing difficulties in accessing dollars from the local forex market to repatriate dividends and proceeds of share sales.

The red herring dented investor confidence by discouraging flows while forcing holders to hold off from selling in dollar-starved markets.

The NSE had expected the reclassification of the bourse to boost inflows from the foreigners.

NSE’s attraction to offshore investors has gotten a further lift from the inclusion of KCB Group to the MSCI frontier market index which has increased the counter’s visibility to foreigners.

KCB has joined Safaricom, Equity Group, and East African Breweries Plc who are already constituents of the frontier market index which captures large and mid-cap stocks across 28 markets.

Foreign investors are an integral part of the NSE bourse based on their active participation in trading activity.

Average foreign participation as a share of equity turnover has recovered from a low 30.1 percent in March 2023 to 62.84 percent in March this year according to additional data from the NSE.","Offshore investors bought a net Sh419.5 million worth of shares on the Nairobi Securities Exchange (NSE) in June, extending the trend to a third straight month.

Business Daily,https://www.businessdailyafrica.com/bd/lifestyle/gardening/gardenpreneurship-shirley-kadoch-flower-factory-4675786,2024-07-01,23:00:00 UTC,Gardenpreneurship: Shirley Kadoch turns city gardens into works of art,"A garden naturally breathes life into a home. But to elevate it into a work of art, infusing the right shades of colour is essential.

When Shirley Kadoch moved to Kenya from her country in the Middle East almost a decade ago, it struck her how most Kenyan homeowners were reluctant to experiment with colourful flowers and plant. It was always a dash of colour here and there in a sea of green.

“I have always loved flowers. Back in my country, I was a garden designer,” says Shirley.

She wanted to continue her career in garden design, but the local market was less vibrant.

“I realised that though roadside vendors had some good varieties, they didn’t have everything I was used to,” she says of the moment she decided to open a flower shop.

As a designer, I always look for bright colours. I wanted to offer a varied and beautiful mix of colours and greenery,” says Shirley.

In the last few years, her Flower Factory in Karen, Nairobi has helped homeowners create magnificent gardens. Retailers and corporates have also been turning to her to make their gardens awe-inspiring spaces.

Business journey

Starting a business can feel like playing snakes and ladders, with its ups and downs.

For Shirley, resilience and a strong passion for bringing together a unique collection of flowers and creating beautiful gardens have helped her navigate the tough entrepreneurship landscape in Kenya.

“It started as a small shop and slowly grew into something big. Now, as you can see, it looks magnificent,” says Shirley.

Current operations

Nestled within the tranquil Talisman Restaurant in Karen, the Flower Factory Garden is a haven for nature lovers. Shirley says the name of the garden was informed by her anticipation of producing numerous flowers. What began with just three flowers has now grown into a vibrant collection of houseplants, herbs, and fruit trees.

The garden also offers hanging baskets, stylish pots, and essential gardening tools. This carefully curated collection, Shirley says, aims to add colour and vitality to both indoor and outdoor spaces.

“Here you will experience the perfect blend of gardening simplicity and fun, all in a unique environment that reconnects you with nature,” she says.

Varieties

The Flower Factory is home to more than 30 species of potted plants, including the short-lived, tender Argyranthemum that blooms in full sun, the ornamental Calibrachoa which grows best in a pot, and Chrysanthemum, Dahlia, Dianthus, Fuchsia Jollies, Gaura, and Gerbera, each with more than three varieties.

The large number of varieties allows her to maintain a wide range of stock for her customers.

“We are always adding more and more. Each time we introduce something new to keep our customers interested. Once you have a bag of flowers, you keep coming back for more,” she says.

Her favourite flower, the petunia, comes in up to five varieties in pink, red, white, and purple, for both standing and hanging pots. It is also a top seller.

“I love the colours, the shape, and the fact that it comes in so many varieties,” she says.

Because they are annuals, Ms Kadoch stresses that they should be replaced every six months.

“I usually recommend using mostly perennials in your garden and leaving a small area for seasonal colour. Since adding colour with annuals is not expensive, you can change it twice a year and still have an amazing effect,” she notes.

The garden also includes Lobularia, New Guinea; an annual flower that lasts one full growing season. There are also ornamental grasses, portulaca, salvia, and sunflowers, which she buys either as seeds or seedlings, and take between two and six months to flower, depending on the plant.

Herb garden

The herb garden has mint, with up to five varieties, including pineapple and chocolate, as well as lemongrass, strawberry, coriander, parsley, rosemary, thyme, curry, sage, and aloe vera.

The basil comes in three varieties, including regular, Thai, and holy basil for her Indian customers.

“I like to have a variety of plants because it attracts a lot of customers and we also want to keep it interesting,” she says.

In the middle of the garden is a bird bath decorated with petunias to add to the fun. Water and seeds are added to attract birds to the garden, creating an almost complete ecosystem.

Flower Factory's most prized possessions come from local growers, major stores, and their farm in Athi River, where they grow many of their flowers.

Her clients include China Square, Carrefour supermarkets and other companies through partnerships.

“Not everyone likes to come to Karen, so we try to reach them everywhere,” she says.

Challenges and successes

“The business is hard, hectic, but it’s fun. The turnover, half of it goes to our customers, the partnerships, so it doesn’t represent our profits. But we are not complaining. We are constantly investing in equipment, greenhouses, and agronomists to train our staff,"" says Shirley.

She adds, “We face challenges such as climate change affecting sunlight, excessive humidity leading to bacterial growth, and reduced shelf life.”

Surrounding oneself with beautiful plants has a positive effect on mental health and well-being. The 44-year-old mother of three says that flowers and gardens have always made her feel younger.

Future plans

Looking ahead, she is striving for improve her business. Her team, which has grown from three to nearly 50, serves as a vital support system. She credits their strength and dedication for keeping her motivated.

The success of the Flower Factory, she says, also depends on loyal customers who return for more plants and advice.","In the last few years, her Flower Factory in Karen, Nairobi has helped homeowners create magnificent gardens.

The Guardian,https://www.theguardian.com/business/article/2024/jul/02/revolut-record-profits-ipo-uk-licence,2024-07-02,08:34:33 UTC,Revolut reports record profits as it hints at plans for IPO,"Revolut has reported record annual profits and further hinted at plans for a stock market flotation, despite still struggling to secure a UK banking licence.

The London-based fintech company, which has been waiting more than three years for its UK licence to be approved, swung to a £438m profit in 2023, having made a £25m loss a year earlier.

Profits were increased by higher interest rates and an ambitious expansion plan that helped to add 12 million customers to its user base last year. Revenues jumped 95% to £1.8bn in 2023, according to its latest annual report.

But bosses have yet to persuade regulators to grant the company a UK banking licence that would open the door to new income streams. A licence would allow Revolut to hold its customers’ deposits, which would help fund its own-branded loans and mortgages. It would also probably persuade regulators in other key countries such as the US to follow suit.

The challenge, in part, has been convincing regulators that Revolut has addressed a number of accounting and reputational concerns in recent years, after EU regulatory breaches, questions over its corporate culture and the late filing of its accounts.

Revolut bosses made little reference in its latest annual report to the UK application,which was lodged in early 2021, saying only: “We are continuing to work closely with the [Prudential Regulation Authority] on our UK bank licence application.”

However, Revolut – which was valued at $33bn in 2021 – gave further hints that it was on track for a bumper initial public offering (IPO). It said in its annual report that it had “enhanced” its financial controls in ways expected of “listed companies”.

It comes a year after the auditor BDO said it had been unable to get a full picture of Revolut’s revenue, and warned that as a result the company’s finances were at risk of being “materially misstated”.

Revolut said it had focused on improving its processes throughout 2023 in a way that allowed BDO to “increase their understanding of the business” and release its financial results earlier, having previously faced significant delays.

“We are pleased that Revolut’s transformation programme has now enabled us to return to a regular financial reporting schedule,” Revolut said. “We are confident we have set solid foundations that, in the long run, will support our expanding banking operations and will bring our financial processes in line with the standards expected from publicly listed companies.”

Revolut more than tripled the salary of its highest-paid director, believed to be the founder and chief executive Nik Storonsky, to £333,000 from £100,00 a year earlier. However, his overall pay plunged 97% due a big share payout in 2022 that took his total pay to £17.8m that year. That figure fell to £378,000 in 2023.","Revolut has reported record annual profits and further hinted at plans for a stock market flotation, despite still struggling to secure a UK banking licence.

The Guardian,https://www.theguardian.com/business/article/2024/jul/01/french-markets-marine-le-pen-euro-dollar,2024-07-01,12:21:48 UTC,French market leaps amid hopes Le Pen will fall short of outright victory,"Shares on the French stock market have risen after the first round of voting in the country’s parliamentary election eased concerns about an outright victory for the rightwing National Rally (RN) party.

The euro rose against the dollar, while the risk premium investors demand for holding French government bonds fell as the markets took the view that the result could have been worse.

But despite a 1.5% jump in France’s benchmark stock market measure – the Cac 40 – on Monday, shares have fallen 5% in the past month amid fears that Marine Le Pen’s RN could still emerge from next Sunday’s second round of voting with an overall majority.

RN secured 33% of the vote, while the leftwing New Popular Front secured 28% and Emmanuel Macron’s centrist bloc won the support of 20% of those who voted.

Alex Everett, an investment manager at the fund management company abrdn, said: “We are not out of the woods yet. The National Rally exceeded expectations and may yet pick up the second-round votes for a relative or even absolute majority.

“Intense horse trading until Tuesday evening will likely see deals cut between the left and centre parties to try to derail this.”

On Friday, the gap between the interest rate (yield) on French and German bonds had widened to its highest since the eurozone debt crisis in 2012, but the spread narrowed slightly from 0.85 percentage points to 0.75 points after the results came in. The gap was less than 0.5 points before the snap election was called.

Krishna Guha, an analyst at the US investment bank Evercore, said: “The vote is far from definitive but leans in favour of the less bad scenario of a hung parliament, political paralysis in Paris and chronic dysfunction at the EU level rather than the worse scenarios of an outright win for the far right or far left that might directly lead to a new European sovereign crisis.”

But this election lands with transport wildly politicised, with clean air, speed limits and high-speed rail all dragged into the wider culture wars.

Meanwhile, transport has become emblematic of decline and the fraying public realm, from failing rail services to the potholes that pockmark Britain’s tarmac.

So what might the election resolve – and what are the transport policies deemed too difficult to sell?

One of Keir Starmer’s less convincing recent repositionings may have been declaring Labour “the only party on the side of drivers” – a response to the long Conservative campaign to hammer home its backing for “people’s freedom to use their cars”.

The Tory plan for motorists was first outlined by the transport secretary, Mark Harper, in 2023 in a conference speech that appeared to echo online conspiracy theories about 15-minute cities, and signalled a clear move away from some of the urban planning measures the government had backed during Covid.

Now the party’s manifesto highlights its “backing drivers bill” in a chapter dedicated to “strengthening our communities”, pledging to curb low-traffic neighbourhoods (LTNs) and 20mph zones and reverse the expansion of London’s ultra-low emission zone (Ulez) – an unpopular move pinned firmly on Labour via the mayor, Sadiq Khan, despite the government’s own part in setting it up.

The rhetoric of ending a “war on motorists” is shared in Reform UK’s manifesto, which would scrap 20mph speed limits, LTNs and the Ulez, along with net zero commitments to transition from fossil fuel to electric vehicles.

Campaigners are concerned by the inflammatory language. Silviya Barrett, policy and research director of the Campaign for Better Transport (CBT), says: “We’re all more than just a driver, just a cyclist – we all need a range of means by which to move. Many drivers use buses and trains too, many walk their kids to school, and most drivers are keen to have more options.”

Another headline Conservative promise is to “stop road pricing”, implicitly accusing Labour of planning a pay-per-mile scheme. Starmer’s party has not backed any such policy, even though transport experts – including motoring organisations – believe some such scheme eventually must come.

Beyond roads, HS2 has perhaps been the only other transport issue as divisive. Scrapping the entire route, including that already half-built from London to Birmingham, is Reform’s headline transport policy, whose back-of-an-envelope calculations claim to save another £25bn.

Any mention of HS2 is conspicuously absent from Labour’s manifesto, while the Conservatives’ reiterates the derided “Network North” mixture of schemes funded by a putative £36bn saving from axing HS2’s northern leg. Only a lonely Liberal Democrat paragraph proposes finding a way to rekindle the high-speed railway to Manchester and beyond.

The post-election action areas: rail reform – and potholes

Despite the fate of the UK’s biggest engineering project, both big parties are pledging to speed up infrastructure delivery, with a Labour review under the ex-Siemens boss Jürgen Maier claiming both time and money could be saved.

But the humble pothole is perhaps focusing more minds: as Labour’s manifesto puts it, “the potholes cratering our roads are a visible sign of the decline after 14 years of Conservative rule”. The Tories have already earmarked £8bn to fill roads instead of building HS2. And even in a Labour manifesto where additional spending is all but forbidden, an extra £65m a year for potholes will be found by putting off a road-building scheme, the planned A27 bypass in West Sussex.

A bigger Labour pledge, but one that it argues is cost-free, is immediate rail reform, with the shadow transport secretary, Louise Haigh, promising “the biggest overhaul to our railways in a generation”.

Labour can afford to go large on reform plans that in many ways align with the Conservatives’ own belated attempts to force through change. Even what might once have been regarded as an ideological red line between the parties – partial renationalisation of rail – has been reluctantly enacted under the current government, as franchising collapsed and more train operators were taken into public hands.

Whoever wins, a new Great British Railways with a shake-up of the railway’s structure and fares is promised. The “guiding mind” will have plenty to work at: latest annual figures from the rail regulator, the Office of Rail and Road, show that only 85% of trains were officially on time (ie within five or 10 minutes of schedule) in 2023-24 – the worst performance in 19 years.

A critical task will be to end the disruption from rail’s long-running industrial relations standoff. While the Conservatives recommit to the ill-fated minimum service levels legislation, Labour makes no direct mention of the strikes, but a manifesto laced with references to working in partnership with unions to “end chaos” suggests a possible reset.

Off limits: road pricing and curbing flying

The vast majority of taxation from motoring comes from fuel duty paid via the petrol pump: about £27bn in annual Treasury revenue destined to dwindle and vanish as cars turn electric. For many transport experts, some form of road pricing appears inevitable and the fairest system. Politics, however, is likely to rule it out.

“Road pricing is toxic because it is very complicated,” says Steve Gooding, director of the RAC Foundation, who was once tasked as a civil servant with drawing up a plan that produced enormous public backlash. “People think – ‘I’m not driving in the rush hour because I like it, but because my employer wants me to turn up’.”

Barrett and the CBT have proposed a 2p per km charge for electric cars to make sure all drivers contribute to the exchequer. Gooding counsels that any scheme should be as simple as possible, citing the kind of pay-per-mile schemes being introduced in Iceland and New Zealand. He adds: “The dilemma is the government wants you to buy an electric car – but how do you do that if you charge people to drive it?”

But, he says: “I would be flabbergasted if someone in the Treasury building isn’t already doing that calculation. We all think this charge is coming. The sooner you are honest about it, the sooner people can factor it into their decisions.”

However, parties appear to be shying away from even the lip service paid to future net zero commitments. A Greenpeace/Friends of the Earth manifesto analysis scores the Conservatives on 1.5 out of 10 on transport, compared with 4.5 for Labour and 8.5 and 9 for the Lib Dems and Greens respectively.

Tackling aviation emissions is a harder, and could be even less electorally popular to fix than the transition for cars. The Lib Dems and Greens espouse some kind of frequent flyer levy, a ban on short domestic flights where a rail alternative exists, and increased taxation, on private jets in particular. Both main parties affirm support for the sector and its dubious solution of sustainable aviation fuels.","But this election lands with transport wildly politicised, with clean air, speed limits and high-speed rail all dragged into the wider culture wars.
Meanwhile, transport has become emblematic of decline and the fraying public realm, from failing rail services to the potholes that pockmark Britain’s tarmac.

Boeing has announced the takeover of Spirit Aerosystems as it tries to retake control of its supply chain following a series of production issues. As part of that deal Airbus will take over Spirit operations serving it, including in Belfast which makes wings and fuselages for the small A220 jet. However, the Unite union has said that 40% of the 3,600 workforce is employed on parts that are not related to Airbus projects, including work for Bombardier and Rolls-Royce. Airbus did not say whether it plans to continue that work. Local politicians are concerned that job losses may result at an historic factory that traces its history back to Short Brothers, the first company to make production aircraft. First minister Michelle O’Neill and deputy first minister Emma Little-Pengelly released statements in which they said the government was working with the company to preserve the Belfast operations. Economy minister Conor Murphy said: “I have been engaging with the company and union on the acquisition and will work with all key stakeholders to ensure that the future status of the highly skilled workforce is protected.” Reuters reported: The leader of Northern Ireland’s largest unionist party, the Democratic Unionist Party’s (DUP) Gavin Robinson, said the sale represented only “a partial solution”. Steve Aiken, a member of the smaller Ulster Unionist Party, said it was an outcome “neither management, workforce or the unions desired”, calling on Northern Ireland’s economy minister to intervene to ensure the entire business is retained. “The minister also needs to emphasis to Airbus the considerable investment the Northern Irish and UK governments have made in wing and aerostructure manufacturing in Belfast and that we will not be allowing our aircraft industry to be asset stripped and manufacturing moved elsewhere,” Aiken added.

19h ago 14.45 CEST German inflation drops as European Central Bank mulls further rate cuts German inflation has dropped slightly more than expected to 2.2% year-on-year in June, as the European Central Bank (ECB) considers whether to cut interest rates again. It dropped from 2.4% in May, and was slightly lower than the 2.3% forecast. The ECB has a 2% inflation target, but it has cut borrowing costs because it believes that inflationary pressure is easing. A further reduction in inflation could support that view. Carsten Brzeski, global head of macro at ING, a Dutch investment bank, said the reading keeps the door open to further ECB rate cuts, but added that inflation “remains sticky above 2%. He wrote: Looking ahead, the stickiness of inflation at slightly too high a level looks set to continue as favourable energy base effects are petering out while, at the same time, wages are increasing. With recent new wage demands, it is hard to see German wage growth coming down in the second half of the year. Claus Vistesen, chief eurozone economist at Pantheon Macroeconomics, a consultancy, a September cut is likely. He said: said: Looking further ahead for Germany, we see scope for a further decline in headline inflation to below 2% by August, helping to get a 25 basis point rate cut over the line in September, before a rebound to just under 2.5% by the end of the year.

19h ago 14.21 CEST Facebook owner Meta's 'pay or consent' model breaches EU law View image in fullscreen A photo taken on 3 April 2024 shows the logo of US online social media and social networking service Facebook on a smartphone screen in Frankfurt am Main, western Germany. Photograph: Kirill Kudryavtsev/AFP/Getty Images Mark Zuckerberg’s Meta has breached the EU’s new digital laws with an advertising model that charges users for ad-free versions of Facebook and Instagram, according to the European Commission. Meta launched a “pay or consent” model last year in an effort to comply with the bloc’s data privacy rules, where users pay a monthly fee for an ad-free version of Facebook or Instagram that does not use their personal data for advertising purposes, writes the Guardian’s Dan Milmo. Users who do not pay have, as part of the signing up process for the platforms, consented to their data being used to tailor personalised adverts that appear in their social media feeds. The European Commission, the EU’s executive body, said the model does not comply with the Digital Markets Act, which is designed to rein in big tech companies. The commission issued preliminary findings from an investigation into “pay or consent” on Monday and found the model “forces users to consent” to their data being collected from multiple platforms. It also does not allow users to choose a service that uses less of their data but is broadly similar to the “with adverts” versions of Facebook and Instagram, the commission said.

19h ago 13.57 CEST Unite the union has said that Tata Steel will enter talks about “future investment for its operations and not just redundancies”, after suspending strikes. Other unions have complained that there has been no progress in the last six weeks, but Unite suggested that Tata had changed stance. Tata has stuck to its position that the two blast furnaces must close this year. However, a plan backed by counterpart unions Community and GMB suggested keeping one furnace open for longer while readying a large investment in greener technology (such as a direct reduced iron plant) to convert iron ore to iron, which could then be fed into an electric arc furnace. That plan would preserve jobs on the blast furnaces for several years, and would then require more workers to run in the longer term – although nowhere near the 2,800 employees who could be out of work by the autumn. View image in fullscreen Unite union general secretary Sharon Graham. Photograph: Jacob King/PA Sharon Graham, Unite’s general secretary, said: This is a significant development in the battle to protect jobs and the long-term future of steel making in South Wales. Investment from Labour secured by Unite will be key to the future of the site. This breakthrough would not have come about without the courage of our members at Port Talbot who were prepared to stand up and fight for their jobs. Workers were simply not prepared to stand idly by while steel making ended and their communities were laid to waste. It is essential that these talks progress swiftly and in good faith with the focus on fresh investment and ensuring the long-term continuation of steel making in South Wales. Share

20h ago 12.59 CEST Tata Steel had written to the three main unions representing steelworkers at Port Talbot offering more talks over its plans to cut 2,800 jobs as it closes the blast furnaces if the strike threat were removed. Owner of Port Talbot steelworks offers fresh talks as last furnace faces closure Read more The unions are hopeful that a Labour government would persuade Tata Steel to delay the closure of at least one blast furnace, preserving thousands of jobs for several years. Unite had threatened strike action from 8 July – after the planned closure of the first blast furnace. The other unions were hanging on for a Labour government after 4 July. Shadow business secretary Jonathan Reynolds has already been in talks with the unions and the company in an effort to avert the closures. Alun Davies, national officer for Community, which represents most of the affected steelworkers, said: With thousands of jobs at stake, we welcome Unite’s decision to withdraw their strike action and get back around the table with their sister steel unions. Tata confirmed that if the strike was called off they are ready to resume discussions on a potential [memorandum of understanding], through the multi-union steel committee which is chaired by Community. The truth is Tata never walked away from those discussions, and at our last meeting on 22 May all unions agreed to conclude the negotiations and put the outcome to our members. Community will welcome resuming those discussions, but we regret that zero progress has been made since 22 May. Share

Photograph: Ben Birchall/PA A union representing some workers at Tata Steel’s works in Port Talbot, south Wales, has suspended strikes after talks with the company. Unite union is understood to have suspended the strike threat after high-level talks between union officials and the company. Tata plans to close two blast furnaces at the site and shift towards much cleaner electric arc furnaces. However, unions want them to delay the closure – the first of which is due this week – to await a Labour government. Labour has said it will offer significant extra state subsidy to the steel industry, above the £500m deal agreed with Tata Steel by the Conservative government. A full statement from Unite is expected shortly. Share

21h ago 12.16 CEST There has been a rush of manufacturing data today. The UK’s purchasing managers’ index (PMI) from S&P Global suggests it is doing better than Europe. The PMI reading came in at 50.9 in June, still well into expansionary territory, in contrast to the two-year contraction in Europe. The reading was worse than the initial flash estimate of 51.4, and down slightly from May’s 22-month high of 51.2. View image in fullscreen Output from the UK manufacturing sector has picked up in recent months. Photograph: S&P Global Rob Dobson, director at S&P Global Market Intelligence, said: The UK manufacturing sector is enjoying its strongest spell of growth for over two years, with June seeing output and new order growth sustained at robust rates similar to May’s recent highs. The performance of the domestic market remains a real positive, providing a ripe source of new contract wins. In contrast, the ongoing weak export performance is concerning, with manufacturers reporting difficulties in securing new business in several key markets including the US, China and mainland Europe. However, that did not stop companies from making job and spending cuts and trying to run down inventories of unsold products, Dobson said. Inflation may be partly behind that: This is coming from a backdrop of renewed cost inflation pressure, with manufacturers’ input prices now rising at the quickest pace since the start of 2023. This renewed upward lurch in manufacturing prices will likely add to concerns over the potential stubbornness of underlying inflationary pressures among hawkish rate setters at the Bank of England.

Photograph: Liam McBurney/PA It’s a big news day for what remains of Northern Irish manufacturing: first, we had the news that Airbus will take over the historic Shorts aerospace operation from Spirit Aerosystems. And now there are renewed questions over the future of the nearby Harland & Wolff site, after its shares were suspended on the London’s junior stock market. It has been forced to temporarily suspend trading in its shares after accounting issues meant it was unable to file audited accounts on time, the Guardian’s Jack Simpson reports. It expects to publish the accounts in the week commencing 8 July, with share trading resuming at that point. The Belfast-based shipbuilder was plunged into uncertainty last month when it was reported that the UK government was witholding the approval of a £200m loan guarantee promised in December to shore up its finances.

22h ago 11.33 CEST France's Cac 40 up 1.5%; euro gains 0.5% against US dollar France’s Cac 40 index has moderated somewhat: the index is now up by 1.5%. That is still a notable move, but less than the nearly 3% surge earlier. The euro is up by 0.5% today against the US dollar at $1.0766. A hung parliament would make it more difficult for either the far-right National Rally (RN) or the leftwing New Popular Front coalition to win a majority and increase spending. Some economists fear that a spending spree could prompt investors to dump French assets. The chart below is what the pre-election move looked like in the bond markets.

The Guardian,https://www.theguardian.com/business/article/2024/jul/01/london-investment-bankers-bonuses-interest-rates,2024-07-01,05:00:44 UTC,London investment bankers to rake in bigger bonuses after two-year slump,"London’s investment bankers are expected to rake in bigger bonuses this financial year, as the City begins to recover from a two-year slump in deals caused by surging interest rates.

Demand for investment banking services – such as facilitating mergers and acquisitions, advising companies and governments on fundraising, and underwriting new stock and bonds – was hit by a sharp increase in borrowing rates after the pandemic, as central banks acted to tame runaway inflation. Jobs and pay were cut as investment banks sought to reduce costs.

But the rate hike cycle has ended, with the UK and US expected to begin reducing the cost of borrowing before Christmas. Forecasters say the recent increase in dealmaking is likely to be felt during the spring bonus season.

“The outlook for 2024 is brightening after a promising first quarter and there are signs of capital markets activity thawing after a two-year freeze,” Dartmouth Partners, a recruiter for banks, consulting firms and startups, said in its annual compensation survey covering London investment bankers.

That is likely to mean bigger bonuses for investment bankers at the London offices of “bulge bracket” firms including JP Morgan, Goldman Sachs, and Deutsche Bank, rewarding those who managed to keep their jobs and wait out nearly two years of falling payouts.

“It feels like there’s more of a an upswing happening,” the Dartmouth Partners founder, Logan Naidu, told the Guardian. “Even if the revenue is not quite there, the activity is and I would suspect that compensation would go up on last year. Will it be back up to where it was in 2021-22? I doubt it is going to be that good. But I think it will be better than than last year.”

Naidu said the UK’s decision to scrap the banker bonus cap, which previously limited bonuses to 100% of salaries, would probably mean that salary rises could be replaced with larger bonuses over the long term. “What might happen is base pay starts to get a bit more suppressed, and variable comp starts to become a larger part of the narrative again, which is probably good news for the banks in terms of how they manage their cost base.”

There is still time for most investment bankers to build their bonus pots. While junior analysts will be paid out at the end of the summer, bonus decisions for higher-level staff will be made at the end of the year.

Dartmouth Partners released data showing average pay tumbled last year across most investment banking positions at eight of the major investment banks, ranging from junior-level analysts to more senior associates and vice-president roles.

While lower-paid analysts took home bonuses worth an average of £44,267 in 2023 – marking a near 50% increase compared with a year earlier – mid-tier associates’ bonus payouts fell by nearly a fifth to £80,065 on average, sending their total pay down 8.3% to £213,940.

Meanwhile, some vice-presidents had their bonuses slashed by 22% to £135,183, reducing total average pay by 11.8% to £303,204.

The survey, which interviewed more than 250 London-based bankers – working at Goldman Sachs, JP Morgan, UBS, Barclays, Morgan Stanley, Citi, Deutsche Bank and Bank of America – found that a number of bankers working at European firms were hoping to jump ship to their American rivals, which tend to offer higher overall compensation.

But even Goldman Sachs cut pay for its vice-presidents by 7.6% on average, while its associates were hit by an 8.3% drop. JP Morgan vice-presidents experienced a 7% cut and associate pay fell by 4.6%.

London-based vice-presidents at Morgan Stanley were hit by the largest drop in total pay on average last year, with it falling nearly by 26.8%, followed by Bank of America where vice-president-level pay fell 23.5%.

Global banks collectively cut more than than 600,000 jobs in 2023, making it one of the biggest years for redundancies since the 2007-08 financial crisis.

“Even though bonuses have been poor, many bankers said they are happy to still have a job,” the survey said.

The Guardian,https://www.theguardian.com/world/article/2024/jun/30/soaring-government-debt-could-roil-global-financial-markets-warns-bis-director,2024-06-30,18:57:59 UTC,"Soaring government debt could roil global financial markets, warns BIS head","Rising government debt levels could disturb global financial markets, the head of the body that advises central banks said on Sunday before France’s high-stakes parliamentary elections.

Agustín Carstens, the general manager of the Bank for International Settlements (BIS), said the world economy was on course for a “smooth landing” from the inflation crisis, but he warned that policymakers, especially politicians, needed to be careful.

Global government debt is already at record levels and elections ranging from the US presidential vote in November, to recent polls in Mexico and South Africa, and votes in France and Britain in the coming week, all carry risks.

Emmanuel Macron’s decision to call a snap election in France has sent the country’s bank stocks crashing and alarmed the bond markets, exacerbating fiscal sustainability concerns in the eurozone’s second-largest economy.

Polls released before the first round of voting on Sunday suggested the far right could win the largest share of the vote, amid record turnout.

Carstens said the BIS was not calling out any “one or two” governments but that the message was clear.

“They [governments] must cut short the rise in public debt and accept that interest rates may not return to the pre-pandemic ultra-low levels,” he said. “We need a solid foundation to build upon.”

With interest rates not about to go back to ultra-low levels, and cost pressures from ageing populations, climate breakdown and rebuilding defence capabilities, economic stimulus plans and a general rise in protectionism could unsettle sensitive markets, BIS warned as it published its annual report.

“They can surprise you with not much notice,” Carstens told reporters, pointing to the turbulence in Britain’s markets after then prime minister Liz Truss’s budget plans, which put some pension funds at risk of collapse. “You really want to avoid that.”

France’s main parties have all promised new spending. Macron’s government had promised to cut the budget deficit from 5.5% of gross domestic product last year to a European Union ceiling of 3% by 2027 – an objective that may be unattainable after the vote, which concludes with a second round on 7 July.

If it forms a government, Marine Le Pen’s National Rally (RN) wants to cut value-added tax (VAT) on energy, which it says would cost €7bn (£5.9bn) for the rest of this year and €12bn in a full year. The RN would also scrap a 2023 increase in the retirement age to 64 from 62, and says its spending plans would be paid for by cutting contributions to the EU budget.

The left-wing New Popular Front alliance, now polling second, says its first moves would include a 10% civil servant pay hike, providing free school lunches, supplies and transport while raising housing subsidies by 10%.

The turmoil has sent the cost to the French government of servicing its debt on the international markets rocketing, with the risk premium, or spread, demanded by holders of French debt over Germany’s rising to its highest level since 2012.

France’s blue-chip CAC 40 index is down 6% since Macron dissolved parliament, with French banks having been among the biggest losers. The big three – Société Générale, BNP Paribas and Crédit Agricole – are down 10%-14% since Macron’s announcement.

French banks have a large amount of debt and are expected to suffer if credit costs increase sharply.

The positive for Carstens was that central banks have successfully reined in inflation, which had hit decades-long highs after the Covid-19 pandemic, and then Russia’s 2022 invasion of Ukraine, which riled commodity markets.

“Compared to last year, I have to say we are in a much better place,” the former Mexican central bank governor said.

Although Carstens said central banks deserved praise for navigating a difficult path that could have resulted in a wave of recessions, he added that they needed to persevere, likening the inflation fight to a course of antibiotics to tackle an illness.

He described an “extreme” scenario where inflation raced up again and central banks needed to raise rates further. But that is not what the BIS expects.","Rising government debt levels could disturb global financial markets, the head of the body that advises central banks said on Sunday before France’s high-stakes parliamentary elections.

The Guardian,https://www.theguardian.com/business/article/2024/jun/30/unusual-economic-indicators,2024-06-30,11:00:20 UTC,What can lipstick and underwear sales tell us about the economy?,"Is the country heading towards a recession? Ask 10 economists and you’ll likely get 10 different answers. Which is why some people have given up on the traditional data – GDP, jobs, etc – and have instead recently been tinkering with more unusual economic indicators to help them guide their companies. Here are a few that I’ve seen.

Uniform patches

One known economic indicator is jobs and for that we tend to rely on unemployment numbers from the Bureau of Labor Statistics. But maybe there’s something better. Like the number of uniform patches sold each year. Uniform patches? Yes, those are the emblems that go on the uniforms worn by millions of workers, from fast food cashiers to drywall contractors. The financial data of one of the world’s largest makers of emblems and patches – privately held World Emblem – can’t be easily obtained. But the company’s owner recently told USA Today that sales are up 19% from the same period last year. A recession? “We’re not seeing it,” says Randy Carr, CEO of the Fort Lauderdale, Florida-based company. “It’s hard to believe there would be.”

Men’s underwear

Ask any guy about underwear, and they’ll usually admit the same thing. When times are good, we’re buying the good material. When money’s tight, we’re wearing those things until they literally fall off. So do men’s underwear sales mirror the economy overall? Some – including former Federal Reserve chief Alan Greenspan – think so. If you want to check out how the men’s underwear business is doing you can look at Hanesbrands or PVH Corp (which owns several leading brands, including Calvin Klein and Tommy Hilfiger) or Ralph Lauren Corporation. “Bottom” line: men’s underwear sales have been mostly flat over the past 12 months.

Lipstick

For the most part, lipstick is a relatively inexpensive accessory, with a typical tube costing anywhere from $5 to $20. History has shown that women will cut back on more expensive beauty goods like makeup and perfume when times are tight. But lipstick? Don’t even go there. When lipstick sales increase as luxury beauty item accessories decrease, that’s another potential sign of economic headwinds. Where to research lipstick sales? Try the big cosmetics companies like L’Oreal, Estee Lauder and Ulta Beauty. All three companies have shown strong revenue gains over the past year.

Overseas freight

World shipping has a significant impact on our economy and instead of tracking units and cargo activity, some economists instead track the price of freight. Why? Because in a supply and demand world, the greater the demand for shipping, the more freight should cost. To track this phenomena, look no further than the Baltic Dry Index. This is a well-watched measure of freight costs for shipping items across the Baltic Sea, one of the world’s busiest shipping lanes. So how are freight costs doing? They’re up more than 55% over the past year and even slightly higher than pre-Covid times.

Recreational vehicles

If you’ve never taken a trip in a recreational vehicle (RV), you’re missing out. It’s fun and a great way to explore our national parks. Some economists think that RV sales are an economic indicator because RVs – a luxury item - are not only expensive to buy, but they come with high maintenance costs and tend to calculate gas usage by gallons per mile. So how’s the RV industry doing? Judging by one of America’s largest makers of these vehicles – Winnebago – not so great. Sales have been declining for the past few years and the company’s stock price has fallen 35% in the past year.

I’m only scratching the surface on unusual economic indicators. Besides RVs you can follow the sales of champagne. Instead of men’s underwear you can also track women’s hemlines (which are believed to rise and fall along with the stock market). You can dig into the buttered popcorn index (which some say increases during times of recession as a small bit of a luxury in an otherwise cruel world). You can even keep track of hairstyles in Japan, where some say that women wear their hair longer when times are good and shorter when times are tough. Good luck finding this data, let alone making any sense of it.

Goofy economic metrics like these are fun to talk about with your friends and colleagues. But they shouldn’t be taken seriously. I run a business, and my go-to economic indicator is my clients. I’ve learned that the best way to insulate my business from the economy is to diversify: have as many clients in as many industries and geographic locations as possible. The US is a big country, and even when one client is cutting back on his underwear purchases in Illinois, I’ll likely have another buying uniform emblems in Texas. Focus on this instead of lipstick.","So do men’s underwear sales mirror the economy overall?

The Guardian,https://www.theguardian.com/business/article/2024/jul/01/roaring-kitty-keith-gill-chewy-stock,2024-07-01,14:10:13 UTC,Chewy shares stage short-lived rally as filing reveals ‘Roaring Kitty’ takes stake,"Shares of Chewy rose 15% premarket on Monday, before reversing sharply, after a filing showed Keith Gill, the stock influencer known as “Roaring Kitty”, had picked up a 6.6% stake in the pet products e-retailer.

The turbulent rally comes days after the investor, known for triggering the meme-stock rally of 2021, posted an uncaptioned picture of a puppy on the social media platform X that briefly sent Chewy shares to a near one-year high on Thursday.

Chewy reversed all its gains and entered the red shortly after the New York Stock Exchange opened on Monday. It finished the day down 6.6%.

The filing with the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), which lists Gill as the reporting person, included a section “Check the appropriate box to designate whether you are a cat” under which the descriptor “I am not a cat” was checked.

The SEC, Chewy and Gill did not immediately respond to requests for comment.

The filing showed that Gill owns 9m shares of Chewy, equating to a stake worth about $245m at the stock’s Friday closing price of $27.24. The stake would make Gill Chewy’s third-largest shareholder, according to LSEG data.

Meme stocks – boosted by memes on social media – first e​merged as a force three years ago, when amateur traders mobilized on platforms including Reddit to boost shares in GameStop.

Their bids triggered an extraordinary, but fleeting, increase in GameStop’s stock market value. It also left hedge funds that had bet against the company nursing heavy losses.

Gill, who led an army of retail investors backing GameStop, is known for his posts on Reddit – where he is known as “DeepFuckingValue” – and YouTube. While silent on the platforms for years after 2021’s frenzy, he has re-emerged in recent months.

Shares of Chewy, which sells pet food as well as medicine online, have risen 15% so far in 2024 but declined in the three preceding years as spending on pets slowed after a post-pandemic boom.

Its sales have been stable in the past few quarters despite weaker consumer spending on discretionary items. “Pet humanization” is a key part of Chewy’s strategy, in which owners splurge on pets as they are considered a part of the family.

Some analysts said last week that Gill’s interest in Chewy could also be influenced by the fact that the pet retailer was founded by GameStop CEO Ryan Cohen.","Shares of Chewy rose 15% premarket on Monday, before reversing sharply, after a filing showed Keith Gill, the stock influencer known as “Roaring Kitty”, had picked up a 6.6% stake in the pet products e-retailer.
The turbulent rally comes days after the investor, known for triggering the meme-stock rally of 2021, posted an uncaptioned picture of a puppy on the social media platform X that briefly sent Chewy shares to a near one-year high on Thursday.
Chewy reversed all its gains and entered the red shortly after the New York Stock Exchange opened on Monday.
The SEC, Chewy and Gill did not immediately respond to requests for comment.
The filing showed that Gill owns 9m shares of Chewy, equating to a stake worth about $245m at the stock’s Friday closing price of $27.24.","['filing', 'gill', 'privacy', 'stock', 'stake', 'online', 'rally', 'kitty', 'takes', 'reveals', 'newsletter', 'known', 'stage', 'roaring', 'pet', 'shortlived', 'shares', 'chewy']",https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/2bf3507b7ed36687bc0899532d8ac7d8eaaa6353/0_126_6197_3720/master/6197.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=a2125e0d574a839ac04e997d8c2d6623,False,share chewi rose premarket monday revers sharpli file show keith gill stock influenc known `` roar kitti '' pick stake pet product eretail turbul ralli come day investor known trigger memestock ralli post uncapt pictur puppi social media platform x briefli sent chewi share near oneyear high thursday chewi revers gain enter red short new york stock exchang open monday finish day file us secur exchang commiss sec list gill report person includ section `` check appropri box design whether cat '' descriptor `` i cat '' check sec chewi gill immedi respond request comment file show gill own m share chewi equat stake worth m stock 's friday close price stake would make gill chewi 's thirdlargest sharehold accord lseg data meme stock - boost meme social media - first e merg forc three year ago amateur trader mobil platform includ reddit boost share gamestop bid trigger extraordinari fleet increas gamestop 's stock market valu also left hedg fund bet compani nurs heavi loss gill led armi retail investor back gamestop known post reddit - known `` deepfuckingvalu '' - youtub silent platform year 's frenzi reemerg recent month share chewi sell pet food well medicin onlin risen far declin three preced year spend pet slow postpandem boom skip past newslett promot sign busi today free daili newslett get set work day - well point busi news analysi need everi morn enter email address sign privaci notic newslett may contain info chariti onlin ad content fund outsid parti inform see newslett may contain info chariti onlin ad content fund outsid parti inform see privaci polici use googl recaptcha protect websit googl privaci polici term servic appli newslett promot sale stabl past quarter despit weaker consum spend discretionari item `` pet human '' key part chewi 's strategi owner splurg pet consid part famili analyst said last week gill 's interest chewi could also influenc fact pet retail found gamestop ceo ryan cohen
The Guardian,https://www.theguardian.com/business/article/2024/jun/26/human-rights-group-fca-shein-lse-flotation-uyghurs,2024-06-26,16:11:48 UTC,Human rights group urges UK financial regulator to block Shein’s LSE flotation,"A human rights group has urged Britain’s financial regulator to block the Chinese fast-fashion retailer Shein’s planned blockbuster flotation on the London Stock Exchange.

Stop Uyghur Genocide, a UK-based human rights charity that alleges minority Uyghur people are being used as forced labour at some of Shein’s cotton suppliers in China’s north-western Xinjiang region, has begun a legal campaign against the planned stock market listing.

Represented by the law firm Leigh Day, the campaign group has written to the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) to argue that “any attempt by Shein to list on the LSE should be refused”.

The China-founded company, which was valued at $66bn (£52bn) in a fundraising round last year, began to explore a listing on the LSE early this year, and is expected to file a prospectus with the UK regulator soon. Shein abandoned its original plan to list in New York after opposition from US politicians.

On Tuesday, Amnesty International UK said Shein’s potential London listing would be a “badge of shame” for the London market because of the fast-fashion firm’s “questionable” labour and human rights standards.

The fast-fashion retailer said on Wednesday: “Shein has a zero-tolerance policy for forced labour and we are committed to respecting human rights. We take visibility across our entire supply chain seriously and we require our contract manufacturers to only source cotton from approved regions.”

Stop Uyghur Genocide said it had reminded the FCA that its US counterpart, the Securities and Exchange Commission, has already refused to recommend the listing of Shein for trading on the US stock exchange because of concerns around labour practices in the company’s supply chains.

The group said the London listing should not be allowed to go ahead because the UK has signed up to International Labour Organization conventions, which set out minimum standards for engaging workers. Any concerns about companies engaging workers in their supply chains that may breach those minimum standards are inconsistent with the UK’s convention obligations, it said.

“The FCA has a statutory duty of integrity and to protect its investors,” the group added.

The Leigh Day solicitor Ricardo Gama, who represents Stop Uyghur Genocide, said: “Stop Uyghur Genocide expects UK financial institutions to uphold the high ethical standards that they pay lip service to, and to make clear that London isn’t the place to come for a ‘no questions asked’ approach to capital. At the very minimum regulators must make sure that laws in place to root out modern slavery are complied with.”

Stop Uyghur Genocide said it was concerned about the London Stock Exchange’s ability to detect and respond to any alleged forced labour in Shein’s supply chains.

Stop Uyghur Genocide is preparing a detailed submission to the regulator to support its letter.

In the meantime, the campaign group’s lawyers have asked the FCA to obtain more information from Shein about the “accuracy of its published modern slavery statement”.



Under the Modern Slavery Act, large businesses have to publish a statement every year that sets out the measures they have taken to ensure slavery and trafficking do not occur in their own operations and their supply chains.

Leigh Day lawyers have urged the regulator to “refuse Shein’s listing application unless the FCA is satisfied that its products are not tainted by forced labour”.

Rahima Mahmut, executive director of Stop Uyghur Genocide, said she was “deeply concerned” about Shein’s potential London listing and said the organisation had been highlighting concerns from national security and human rights experts that Shein “could be associated with egregious human rights abuses, including modern slavery, and pose ethical and security risks to businesses and citizens”.

“Our investment community must not support companies like Shein who are reportedly linked to the Chinese state and which we believe may enable the ongoing genocidal policies against Uyghurs.”

The FCA declined to comment on Shein’s potential listing. It noted that it has no investigation or enforcement powers relating to alleged breaches of legislation not within its remit, such as the Modern Slavery Act or tax legislation.

Before a company’s shares can be admitted to the LSE, the firm must apply to the FCA for admission to listing and to approve its prospectus. The watchdog said it was the company’s responsibility to ensure the information in its prospectus is accurate, and not the FCA’s role to independently verify the accurate of information.

Michael Polak, barrister and chair of Lawyers for Uyghur Rights, said: “A firm alleged to have involvement in goods directly produced by slave labour in the Uyghur region creates a risk that those vital principles will be violated. We will ask the FCA to consider the expert evidence that we will provide to them before deciding on a public listing in the UK.”","A human rights group has urged Britain’s financial regulator to block the Chinese fast-fashion retailer Shein’s planned blockbuster flotation on the London Stock Exchange.

LGIM warns this morning that it believes companies need to do more to play their part in efforts to mitigate climate change risks. UPDATE: It will divest Glencore shares held in its Future World fund range, LGIM’s ESG fund ranges, and all defined contribution (DC) auto-enrolment default funds in L&G Workplace Pensions and the L&G Mastertrust. The decision applies to funds covering around £176bn in assets under management. Glencore, which is the world’s biggest coal shipper, is “phasing down” its coal portfolio, as part of a plan to only achieve net zero emissions by the middle of the century. That means some existing coalmines would run until 2050, despite concerns about the pollution caused by thermal coal. ‘Largest ever’ NSW coalmine plan will put pressure on state’s net zero target, watchdog says Read more Legal & General says: “LGIM remains concerned that Glencore has not disclosed plans for thermal coal production that are aligned with a net zero pathway.” LGIM are the 22nd largest Glencore investor overall, according to data from LSEG, with 0.44% of the company’s shares.

6d ago 16.42 CEST Back in the UK, the Czech billionaire hoping to buy Royal Mail has confirmed he is considering offering employees a stake in the business, as his company asked shareholders to back its £3.6 billion takeover bid. As flagged this morning, Daniel Kretinsky’s EP Group set out its plans for the future of Royal Mail’s owner, International Distribution Services (IDS), in a letter sent to shareholders. In the offer letter, EP Group said it is “exploring, following completion of the acquisition, potentially offering a form of employee participation model in the business” which could include “profit-sharing” among all members of staff. Unions representing postal workers have previously called for staff to be given a stake in the company via a shake-up of its structure. Share

New home sales declined 11.3% to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 619,000 units last month, the lowest level since November. This indicates that high mortgage rates are hurting demand, weakening the housing market.

6d ago 15.08 CEST Looking at the European economy, S&P Global says activity in the eurozone is on the rise, with the May composite purchasing managers’ indices firmly above the expansion threshold. Today’s report says: The eurozone has exited the recent manufacturing recession, putting it cyclically ahead of the U.S. Meanwhile, the labor market continues to slow although the unemployment rate remains near all-time lows. Southern Europe (Spain and Italy) continues to outperform Northern Europe (Germany) not only due to a prevalence of services, but also a rise in productivity in the case of Spain. Recent slower growth at the eurozone level reflects in part a faster passthrough of monetary policy, which has led to weaker inflation pressures. Share

6d ago 14.56 CEST S&P Global have raised their forecast for the UK economy this year. They now expect UK GDP to rise by 0.6% this year, up from a previous forecast of 0.3%. Chief economist Paul Gruenwald says “the recovery in services in the first quarter has been stronger than expected” in the UK. However, the UK growth forecast in 2025 has been trimmed to 1.2%, from 1.4%. Spain’s growth forecast has also been revised up, to 2.2% in 2024 from 1.8%. This is to reflect “robust household balance sheets and rapid disinflation”, Gruenwald explains. Share

6d ago 14.35 CEST S&P Global: soft-landing narrative remains valid The global economy remain on track for a soft landing, as central banks start to lower interest rates followin recent falls in inflation. So says credit rating agency S&P Global, in its latest global economic update. S&P Global is still optimistic that policymakers will pull off a ‘soft landing’ – bringing down inflation without triggering a recession. It explains: GDP growth has moderated in most economies (the U.S. remains an outlier) and recessions have been avoided. Demand pressures have come down, bringing inflation back toward target. Services demand and employment remain robust, moderating the speed of decline, and bolstering the probability of a soft landing. S&P Global argues that central banks have reached “the beginning of the end-game”, as some – such as the Bank of Canada, the Swiss National Bank and the European Central Bank – have recently started cutting interest rates in response to falling inflation. Although inflation has been stickier than hoped, S&P Global argues this is “just the flipside” of resilient spending and strong jobs markets, and compatible with a soft landing. They say: A recession with a sharp drop in employment and labor demand would likely produce a faster decline in inflation, but is that what we really want? Share

6d ago 14.32 CEST Dominic Chappell must repay £50m over BHS collapse Back in the UK retail sector, the former head of BHS is digesting a court ruling that he must pay at least £50m to cover losses racked up before its collapse. Yeterday, a judge found that Dominic Chappell had sought to “plunder” the UK department store chain, which collapsed in 2016. Mr Justice Leech said Chappell had agreed to purchase BHS without “any prospect” of obtaining working capital to meet its day-to-day financial needs. He then took the “opportunity to plunder the BHS Group as and when he could”, the judge explained. The Financial Times has more details: At a hearing on Tuesday, the judge said Chappell “should make the payments” set out in a draft order. A copy of the order, seen by the Financial Times, shows the sums include £21.5m for a wrongful trading claim, £17.5m for breach of fiduciary duty, plus costs and interest, totalling at least £50m. Back in 2020, Chappell was been sentenced to six years in jail for evading tax on the £2.2m income he received from his doomed takeover of BHS.

The CBI’s latest healthcheck on UK retailers, just released, found that retail sales volumes fell in the year to June, following a modest recovery in May. The CBI’s retail sales volume gauge fell to -24% this month, from +8% in May, showing that a majority of retailers reported a drop in volumes compared to the previous year.

Sales volumes are expected to remain below seasonal norms in July, albeit to a lesser extent. #DTS pic.twitter.com/RhJ7ohmOgj — CBI Economics (@CBI_Economics) June 26, 2024 The CBI explains: Sales were reported to be well below “average” for the time of year (-39% from +2% in May). Sales volumes are expected to remain below seasonal norms in July, albeit to a lesser extent (-29%).

Orders placed upon suppliers fell moderately in the year to June at a broadly similar pace to last month (-14% from -11% in May). Retailers expect the cutback in orders to continue next month (-16%). Alpesh Paleja, CBI interim deputy chief economist, says: “Last month’s nascent recovery in sales proved to be short-lived, with retailers reporting a faster-than-anticipated decline this month. Unseasonably cold weather in June may have played a role, but it’s notable that internet retail sales fell sharply in our survey, too. Consumer fundamentals are improving, with inflation now at the Bank of England’s 2% target and real incomes rising. But it’s clear that households are still struggling with the legacies of the cost-of-living crisis, with the level of prices still historically high in some areas. With consumer demand still on shaky ground, an incoming government can help business by ensuring that the UK is the most attractive place to start, grow and run a business. This will require bold action such as delivering a holistic cross-economy solution to the UK’s overly complex business rates system, which is a particular burden for retailers. This would help to alleviate the burden of higher costs.” Share

6d ago 11.34 CEST LGIM will also divest from TJX Legal & General Investment Management has also decided to divest its stake in US retail chain TJX, the parent company of UK chain TK Maxx. LGIM says TJX, like Glencore, failed to sufficiently address concerns raised in recent years about its environmental impact. LGIM says it concerned over TJX’s lack of a zero-deforestation policy and insufficient disclosure of “material Scope 3 emissions” that fail to account for its material value chains’ emissions. Today’s decisions will raise the number of divestments through LGIM’s Climate Impact Pledge to 16. LGIM says this “stewardship” of its investments is a critical lever in the global push to reach net zero. Stephen Beer, senior manager sustainability and responsible investment at Legal & General Investment Management, adds: We find that as time progresses, our conversations with companies can become harder-edged; not necessarily more difficult, but more focused. We use tools such as voting and divestment to encourage companies to meet our expectations on net-zero, while also sending a clear signal to the wider market. While divestment is one of the many stewardship tools we use as a mechanism for driving change, we see it as a last resort and by no means the last stage of engagement. Our engagement will continue, and where companies make sufficient progress, they will be reinstated. Ultimately, whilst we are focused on a net-zero objective, there is no one size fits all approach; our engagement approach is nuanced, it is about listening to companies and understanding the challenges they face, as well as the potential opportunities ahead, in accelerating the pace of the transition at a global scale.” Share","Share6d ago 14.56 CEST S&P Global have raised their forecast for the UK economy this year.

Nvidia has jumped 2.8% in early trading, to $121.46, up from $118 last night, after losing over $500bn in a dramatic tumble over the last three sesssions. Nvidia’s share price at the open, 25 June 2024 Photograph: Bloomberg As flagged this morning, technical analysts had indicated that Nvidia’s shares could have support at $115.

7d ago 16.12 CEST US consumer confidence dips US consumer morale has dropped this month, a new survey shows, but was stronger than expected. The Conference Board’s consumer confidence index dipped in June to 100.4, down from 101.3 in May. Economists had expected it would fall more, to exactly 100. The decline was due to a deteriorating short-term outlook for income, business, and conditions in the jobs market. Dana M. Peterson, chief economist at The Conference Board, explains: “Confidence pulled back in June but remained within the same narrow range that’s held throughout the past two years, as strength in current labor market views continued to outweigh concerns about the future. However, if material weaknesses in the labor market appear, Confidence could weaken as the year progresses.” 📈😁Americans are feeling confident!

The Nasdaq Composite index has gained 95 points, or 0.56%, to 17,592 points The broader S&P 500 index is up 0.2%, with Nvidia the fourth highest riser. Cruise operator Carnival is leading the charge, after lifting its annual profit forecast today.

7d ago 15.22 CEST A summer of savings: Barclays and HSBC to cut fixed-rate mortgage deals Rupert Jones HSBC and Barclays are cutting rates on their fixed mortgage deals in what some brokers claim could be the start of a “summer of savings” for homebuyers and those looking to remortgage. Barclays has reduced rates by more than 0.25 percentage points in some cases from Tuesday, and its cuts led to a quick response from HSBC, which said it would be cutting rates across its home loans range with effect from Wednesday. While new home loan rates have been broadly stable over the last month or two, the pricing of some deals has crept up. However, recent improvements to money market swap rates – which largely determine the pricing of new fixed deals – appear to have prompted two of the biggest mortgage lenders to reduce their rates, with others predicted to follow suit.

7d ago 15.03 CEST Over in Canada, inflation has jumped unexpectedly. Consumer prices across the Canadian economy rose by 2.9% in the year to May, up from 2.7% in April, dashing hopes of a small fall. This may be slightly awkward for the Bank of Canada, which cut interest rates earlier this month. 🔴 ⚠️ BREAKING: CANADIAN CPI YOY ACTUAL 2.9% (FORECAST 2.6%, PREVIOUS 2.7%) $MACRO — FinancialJuice (@financialjuice) June 25, 2024 Statistics Canada said the increase was due to higher prices for services, which rose 4.6% in May following a 4.2% increase in April. Faster price growth for services was led by cellular services, travel tours, rent and air transportation. Prices for goods (+1.0%) grew at the same rate as in April. Not a surprise in the least. Canada’s inflation rate is largely driven by enternal factors outside of the control of Canada. Inflation will continue to be stubbornly sticky as the world continues to “deglobalize” and conflicts continue to rise. https://t.co/mDefl7oZ9g — John Ruffolo (@ruffoloj) June 25, 2024 Share Updated at 15.20 CEST

7d ago 14.44 CEST Amnesty: Shein’s floatation would be a ‘badge of shame’ for London Stock Exchange Human rights organisation Amnesty International has hit out at plans for China’s fast fashion group Shein to float on the London Stock Exchange. It emerged yesterday that Shein has confidentially filed for a public listing in London, which could value the company at around £50bn. This would be London’s biggest ever float. Shein wins Labour support as it prepares £50bn London listing Read more But Dominique Muller, Amnesty International researcher specialising in the garment industry, says the City should demand transparent and binding safeguards regarding human rights standards, before admitting Shein to the fold: ​“It’s deeply troubling that a company with questionable labour and human rights standards and an unsustainable fast fashion business model could be set to reap hundreds of millions of pounds via a sale of shares and a listing on the London Stock Exchange. “Where SHEIN goes, others will try to follow. The UK authorities and the London Stock Exchange should not facilitate SHEIN’s listing until transparent and binding safeguards regarding internationally accepted human rights standards covering its entire supply chain are agreed and applied, and any abuses identified fully remedied. “Rewarding SHEIN’s current methods via a flotation would be a badge of shame for the London Stock Exchange, the bankers helping bring it to market, and any investors set to profit from it. It would be an appalling example of a process which delivers for the rich by squeezing the poor. It validates the view that it is acceptable to regard workers and their rights, company products and the environment as expendable – which cheapens us all. “It is essential the new UK government does not allow a race to the bottom in terms of corporate and human rights standards. It should require companies to prevent serious environmental harms and human rights abuses occurring throughout their entire operations and supply chains. It should enable workers whose rights are abused by company activities anywhere in the world recourse to justice through UK courts.” Shein has been accused of using forced labour to make its affordable clothing, such as t-shirts and sweaters. ‘Worst of the worst’: why is fast fashion retailer Shein launching a reality show? Read more The Mail on Sunday reported last weekend that Shein may scrap its London float plans, amid growing disquiet in Beijing over the way the fast-fashion retailer is portrayed in the UK.

7d ago 14.25 CEST Fed Governor Bowman open to raising rates if inflation doesn’t improve A US central bank policymaker has indicated she would be open to raising interest rates if inflation not fall as hoped. In a speech in London today, Federal Reserve governor Michelle Bowman also said the time is not right yet to start lowering borrowing costs. Bowman explained: Should the incoming data indicate that inflation is moving sustainably toward our 2% goal, it will eventually become appropriate to gradually lower the federal funds rate to prevent monetary policy from becoming overly restrictive. However, we are still not yet at the point where it is appropriate to lower the policy rate. In my view, we should consider a range of possible scenarios that could unfold when considering how the FOMC’s monetary policy decisions may evolve. I remain willing to raise the target range for the federal funds rate at a future meeting should progress on inflation stall or even reverse. Latest comments from Fed's Bowman, though at the more hawkish end of the spectrum, suggest chances of the US Fed cutting rates this year (notwithstanding the Nov Presidential Elections) rapidly receding. One cut in December looking more of a 50:50 call. https://t.co/dRPO7UtrlW — Fraser Coutts (@fcoutts_) June 25, 2024 Last month, US consumer price inflation fell to an annual rate of 3.3%, down from 3.4% in April.

7d ago 14.16 CEST Vauxhall owner says car plants could shut unless ‘stupid’ UK rules change Lisa O'Carroll The owner of the Vauxhall, Peugeot and Citroën brands has warned its car plants in Ellesmere Port and Luton could close unless market demand for electric vehicles and “stupid” regulatory conditions change. The UK managing director of Stellantis said the company did not want to shut operations in the UK but it would make a decision in “less than a year” in the face of unreasonable government sales quotas and lack of consumer incentives in relation to VAT on vehicles and electricity. Maria Grazia Davino said today: “You have to make strategies that are based on efficiency. I want to keep the production [in the] UK and I want to be clear on this.” She added that the demand for electric vehicles was “soft” and unless there were further incentives for businesses to buy the electric commercial vehicles or more support from the government it may have no choice.

7d ago 14.10 CEST Burrito chain Tortilla has bought its biggest European competitor in a deal worth nearly £4m, PA Media reports, as it hopes to attract new consumers on the go, ahead of the Paris Olympics. Tortilla is buying 13 restaurants from rival Fresh Burritos, in prime locations in Paris and other cities in France. The acquisition also includes a network of 19 franchised locations and the rights to the brand. The London-based company, which has 89 stores, predominantly in the UK, said the purchase will give it a “launchpad” to expand further into Europe. It says: “Tortilla’s international ambitions are no secret, and acquiring Fresh Burritos is our gateway to mainland Europe. “With Mexican cuisine surging in popularity, these prime French locations give us a solid launchpad.” Share

7d ago 13.56 CEST Microsoft president Brad Smith has responded to the EC’s statement of objections about Teams bundling, saying: “Having unbundled Teams and taken initial interoperability steps, we appreciate the additional clarity provided today and will work to find solutions to address the Commission’s remaining concerns.” Share

7d ago 13.36 CEST Margrethe Vestager, executive vice-president in charge of EC competition policy, says: We are concerned that Microsoft may be giving its own communication product Teams an undue advantage over competitors, by tying it to its popular productivity suites for businesses. And preserving competition for remote communication and collaboration tools is essential as it also fosters innovation on these markets. If confirmed, Microsoft’s conduct would be illegal under our competition rules. Microsoft now has the opportunity to reply to our concerns. Share

7d ago 13.33 CEST Microsoft faces a hefty antitrust fine if the EC’s charges over Teams bundling are upheld, points out Reuters. It risks a fine of as much as 10% of its global annual turnover if it is found guilty of the antitrust breaches announced today. Reuters adds: Two decades after Microsoft’s last EU fine, the EU competition watchdog’s latest action was triggered by a 2020 complaint from rival workspace messaging app Slack, owned by Salesforce. The U.S. tech giant had to pay €2.2bn ($2.4 billion) in EU antitrust fines two decades ago for tying, or bundling, two or more products together.

Preqin, which specialises in providing data and information on the private equity sector and other alternative assets, is being bought by BlackRock, the world's biggest asset manager.

The sale will net approximately £2.04bn to Valhalla Ventures, the family holding company of Mark O'Hare, Preqin's founder.

The remaining £510m will be shared between management and employees at Preqin, which is based near London's Victoria station and which employs more than 500 people in all of the world's major financial centres including New York, Tokyo, Singapore and Hong Kong.

A number of them are expected to become millionaires many times over as a result.

Remarkably, the deal means that after its completion, Mr O'Hare's personal net worth will be greater than that of Larry Fink, BlackRock's founder, chairman and chief executive and one of the financial world's most influential figures.

Mr O'Hare, who will join BlackRock as a vice-chair, said today: ""BlackRock is known for excellence in both investment management and financial technology, and together we can accelerate our efforts to deliver better private markets data and analytics to all of our clients at scale.

""I look forward to joining BlackRock and continuing to play a role in the continued growth and success of Preqin and our customers.""

High-flying O'Hare

Preqin is not the first business to have been built and sold by 65-year old Mr O'Hare.

Educated at the University of Cambridge, where he graduated with a first in Mathematics and Mathematical Statistics, Mr O'Hare - who also represented his college in rowing - went on to study finance at London Business School before joining Boston Consulting Group (BCG), advising clients in Europe, the US and Africa across several industries including financial services, healthcare, retail, industrial and consumer products.

After seven years at BCG, Mr O'Hare - who was born in London but was raised in Glasgow and speaks with a slight Scottish accent - left in 1986 to set up an independent consultancy called Goodall, Alexander, O'Hare & Co. Then, in 1993, he launched Citywatch, a provider of financial information which specialised in the monitoring and measuring of UK equity ownership.

He sold the business to Reuters in 1998 for a reported £2.5m - four-fifths of which went to him - and left the following year reunited with his former colleague Chris Goodall to set up e-Acorn.com, a business launched to provide seed funding and advice to internet start-ups.

While the bursting of the dot-com bubble put paid to those plans, Mr O'Hare - a part-time pilot who in June 1999 crash-landed his Piper Seneca seven-seat light aircraft - resurfaced in 2003 to launch Private Equity Intelligence, or Preqin.

As private equity grew in importance as an asset class, so too did Preqin, which in 2016 acquired Baxon Solutions as a way of providing its data and solutions via the cloud. It sold the business three years later but two years on from that, in 2021, snapped up a private markets technology, services and administration business called Colmore.

Preqin Academy

Around the same time it also launched Preqin Academy as a free online resource for students, early-career professionals and market participants wanting to learn more about the alternative assets industry.

Mr O'Hare, a frequent correspondent to the letters pages of the Financial Times down the years, stepped down as chief executive in 2022 and it was reported that the business had been put up for sale.

The sale price, though, is considerably higher than the initial £1bn valuation that was originally touted. The FT reported today that the ratings and financial data giant S&P had expressed an interest in Preqin, as had Bloomberg, the terminals giant.

Preqin is the latest big-ticket acquisition involving a data provider.

IHS Markit, another UK-founded business, was acquired in 2020 for £32bn by S&P while the same year saw the London Stock Exchange Group (LSEG) pay Thomson Reuters £20bn for its financial and risk business Refinitiv.

Fast-growing private markets sector

For BlackRock, the attraction of Preqin is that it takes the funds giant further into the fast-growing field of private markets, an area of growing interest to fund managers and their clients.

Rob Goldstein, chief operating officer at BlackRock, noted that the company had been a client of Preqin for a number of years.

He added: ""BlackRock's vision has always been to bring together investments, technology, and data to offer solutions that meet our clients' needs across their whole portfolio.

""As clients increasingly evolve their focus from choosing products to constructing portfolios, this shift requires technology, data, and analytics that create a 'common language' for investing across both public and private markets. We see data powering the industry across technology, capital formation, investing, and risk management.""

Away from work, Mr O'Hare and his South African-born wife Lindy, who have four children, have other passions.

Thorington Theatre

The couple own Stone House Farm, a Grade-II listed farmhouse near Southwold on the Suffolk coast, where in 2019 - just before the pandemic - they decided to build an open-air theatre in a patch of woodland where there was a natural clearing as a result of a Second World War bomb.

Thorington Theatre, a 350-seat venue, welcomed its first audiences in June 2021. Initially, the couple thought the venue would just be used by local theatre and amateur dramatic groups, but it rapidly became much bigger.

Mrs O'Hare, a former interior designer, told The Stage last year her ultimate ambition was to have the Royal Shakespeare Company bring a production of A Midsummer Night's Dream to the theatre.

But she added: ""One day, Ed Sheeran will come. He lives at Framlingham, so he's only down the road. That's the dream.""

The couple now have the wherewithal to offer the singer a decent fee, too.","The sale will net approximately £2.04bn to Valhalla Ventures, the family holding company of Mark O'Hare, Preqin's founder.

Carriage Services (NYSE:CSV) is a small-cap funeral consolidation company that competes in an overlooked industry. I believe that Carriage is significantly undervalued due to at-a-glance impressions of high leverage and a one-time decline in revenue. In reality, most of Carriage's debt lies in low interest-bearing senior bonds, any debt not at these rates is being paid down in large sums each quarter, and revenue has climbed to a sustainable all-time high in Q1 2024. After speaking with industry leaders about the valuations on recent acquisitions in this space, I believe that Carriage is due for an almost double price increase at $55 per share and is a likely target for a future acquisition.

About Carriage

Founded in 1991, Carriage Services is the second-largest funeral home and cemetery consolidator on the public market. Carriage operates in the United States with over 165 funeral homes in 26 states, 31 cemeteries in 11 states and 2800 employees. Carriage Services' stock is traded on the New York Stock Exchange with a market capitalization of $414 million at $27 per share and a free float percentage of 86.7%.

Investment Case

Revenue growth has grown steadily after a decline following the COVID-19 pandemic. During the pandemic, the funeral industry experienced a rare increase in funeral cases, with Carriage's revenue increasing 37% in a 2-year span. As the pandemic came to an end, funeral industry revenue decreased in 2022. During this period, Carriage's stock dropped from a high of $64 per share in mid-2022 to $20 per share at the end of 2023. While revenue has grown over the past three quarters to reach a new high in 2024, Carriage's stock price remains priced at the revenue decline in 2022 at $27 per share.

At a closer look, Carriage's debt has favorable terms and is being paid down in large amounts with excess cash flow. Believing their stock price was discounted, Carriage's prior management partially financed a repurchase of 2,906,983 shares (16% of shares outstanding) at an average purchase price of $49 per share. It is our belief that the 2022 decline in stock price was partially due to the firm's leverage ratio increasing to fund this buyback. In response to this decline, Carriage Services announced a credit profile restoration plan in which it intends to delever its balance sheet and achieve a Total Debt to Consolidated EBITDA Ratio of 4.0-4.3 times by the end of 2024. It is worth noting that of their $560 million in debt, $400 million is fixed rate 4.25% senior notes maturing in 2029, and $150 million is drawn on a revolving credit facility with the most recent interest payment at 8.9%. Because the rate spread on the credit facility decreases with the leverage ratio, the company has paid down this debt by $34.5 million in 2023 and $25 million during Q1 2024.

In May 2024, Park Lawn Corporation (PLC), the third largest publicly traded funeral consolidator in North America and Carriage's primary competitor, announced they are being acquired by both Homesteaders, a privately held burial life insurance company, and Birch Hill Partners, a private equity firm. Park Lawn was purchased at 62.1% over its stock price in a first-mover attempt by the acquirers to vertically integrate Homesteaders' insurance business by locking in Park Lawn's funeral homes as its primary sales locations. Since Carriage Services is the last small-cap funeral consolidator available on the public market with 30% greater revenue and cash flow on assets compared to Park Lawn, it is a likely target for over 5 similar funeral insurance companies to acquire for a similar competitive advantage. If purchased at the same EBITDA/EV multiple as Park Lawn, Carriage's sale price would be $55 per share.

Compared to its peers, Carriage has maintained steady operational performance with a high return on invested capital. As the funeral consolidation industry continues to grow due to retiring funeral home owners and an aging US population, Carriage has seen success with its acquisition strategy by buying the largest funeral homes and cemeteries available in growing markets. In contrast to buying multiple smaller funeral homes, Carriage's strategy allows it to place more administrative focus on each location and eventually generate a higher return on the purchased assets. This is evident in Carriage's 29% 2023 EBITDA Margin, which is noticeably higher than the recently acquired Park Lawn Corporation's 19% and similar to industry leader Service Corporation International's (SCI) 30%. Additionally, Carriage has transitioned to a new management team hired from SCI. I expect this team to bring operational and strategic management styles over from SCI and begin to model Carriage after the largest company in the space.

Industry Expert Opinion

In our research of the company, I spoke with multiple industry leaders for perspectives. One of those conversations was with Vineyard Capital, a private group with 22 years of industry experience. Vineyard owns majority interests in operating groups with up to 120 funeral home locations. Executives at Vineyard, asked not to be quoted, however expressed strong support for the industry and of Carriage's potential and valuation. They mentioned that the current public valuation of Carriage carries a lower multiple compared to the multiples observed in single-location transactions. They informed us that Vineyard has acquired a small stake in Carriage and expects to continue accumulation of shares at current prices.

The Deathcare Consolidation Industry

Industry Overview

Companies in this industry acquire funeral homes and cemeteries, typically from independent operators. These funeral locations provide services such as burials, viewings and memorials, with the fastest growing segment being cremations. Prominent companies in this industry include Service Corporation International, Park Lawn Corporation (PLC:CA), and Carriage Services, with private equity firms moving into the space as well.

According to the NFDA, as of mid-2023, 89.2% of funeral home businesses in the United States are still independent and family owned, with 27% of owners saying they planned to sell their business or retire within five years. In addition to these funeral homes coming on the market, consolidators are also incentivized by major tailwinds in the industry as 73 million baby boomers continue to age, and the US mortality rate is expected to increase.

The sales mix between cremations and burials is one of the fastest changing aspects of the industry due to a decline in religious activities and the cost disparity between the two. According to the NFDA, the U.S. cremation rate is expected to increase from 60.5% in 2023 to 81.4% by 2045.

Risks

Funeral home customers are increasingly choosing cremation over traditional burials in an industry-wide shift toward the more cost-effective option. According to the National Funeral Directors Association, 60.5% of consumers are expected to opt for cremation, and 34.5% are projected to choose a burial service. By 2045, the NFDA expects the cremation rate to top 81.4%. As highlighted below, if a customer opts for a direct cremation (no viewing or service), the cost could be up to 78% less than a traditional burial. Typically, however, customers choose a traditional cremation over direct, which comes at an average 37% discount compared to burials. Funeral home consolidators must adapt to this trend by adjusting high fixed burial-specific costs and making strategic cremation-focused acquisitions. Carriage has followed this trend with a recent $44 million cash acquisition of a cremation business in Bakersfield, CA.

Average Costs Traditional Funeral Direct Funeral Burial $9,995 $5,128 Cremation $6,280 $2,196 Click to enlarge

As mentioned in the key points, Carriage's leverage ratio of 5.3x Debt/EBITDA is higher than some investors would typically be comfortable with. Its interest expense for Q1 2024 was $8.5 million, which would bring its interest coverage ratio for the quarter to 2.42, up from 2.23 in Q1 2023. Carriage has enacted a plan to pay down its high-rate credit facility, and I expect this interest coverage ratio to be in line with Carriage's competitors by years end. While a 5x Debt/EBITDA leverage ratio is historically high, over three-quarters of the debt rests in 4.25% fixed notes, which carry an inherent discount in today's rate environment, lowering the risk exposure.

Park Lawn Corp Acquisition and Broader Implications

In May 2024, Park Lawn Corporation, the second largest publicly traded funeral consolidator and Carriage's primary competitor, announced they are being acquired by both Homesteaders, a privately held burial life insurance company and Birch Hill Partners, a Canadian private equity firm. Park Lawn was purchased at 62.1% over its stock price in a first-mover attempt by the acquirer to vertically integrate its insurance business by locking in Park Lawn's funeral homes as its primary sales locations.

The Funeral Home Insurance Sales Ecosystem

According to Allied Market Research, the 33 top final expense carriers surveyed by the Life Insurance Council had more than 3 million policies in force paying more than $2 billion in premiums, and the average premium per policy sold had grown to an attractive $747 by 2017, with growth expected due to increase in the aging population, marketing strategies and awareness from the COVID-19 pandemic. Companies in this space include Global Atlantic Group, Funeral Directors Life, Investors Heritage, National Guardian Life Insurance Company, Pekin Insurance, Security National Life and others.

Funeral home revenue is either collected at-need with no arrangements prior to the death of an individual, or pre-need with a prepayment direct to the funeral home or through funeral insurance. Through a partnership, funeral homes and consolidators can select insurance companies to write policies for by setting up general agencies under the funeral home's operations. Funeral insurance policies are sold through the funeral locations by registered sales agents who split the commission on these policies with the general agencies, usually owned by the funeral homes. A funeral consolidator with over a hundred locations commands a higher commission and bonus level for agreeing to exclusively write policies for an insurance company.

Funeral homes benefit from this sales structure by getting an increase in pre-need revenue to be used at their location in the future, and additional earnings from large commissions and bonuses on writing these policies.

Vertical Integration of Park Lawn into Homesteaders

As previously noted, Homesteaders, a major funeral insurance company, intends to acquire Park Lawn Corp, the second largest publicly traded funeral consolidator to attempt to create value with vertical integration. Speaking with a leader of a funeral insurance company, I learned that large amounts of annual funeral insurance sales have been lost in the past few years due to consolidators acquiring their individual funeral sales locations. Considering this, an acquisition of a funeral home consolidator would allow an insurance company to lock in the acquired sales locations for exclusive policy writing and possibly allow the insurance provider to adjust commissions and increase insurance profit margins.

Potential for Insurance Acquisition

Seeing that the funeral insurance industry is highly competitive and expected to steadily grow over the next decade, acquisitions of funeral home portfolios could be a clear path to generating income from multiple sources. After the Park Lawn acquisition, Carriage Services remains the last small-cap funeral consolidator on the public market and is a likely target for other funeral insurance companies to acquire for a competitive advantage.

Potential for Other Acquisition

Service Corporation International, the largest funeral home consolidator with a $10.6 billion market capitalization, has acquired three public funeral consolidators in the last 20 years: Alderwoods, Stewart and Keystone. Stewart and Keystone both had an intention to go private when SCI outbid the private buyers. Its synergies as a large consolidator allow SCI to bid higher for these portfolios by reducing overhead. In a hypothetical acquisition of Carriage, it is likely that SCI could reduce Carriage's overhead by half, from $50 million to $25 million. If that difference is factored into Carriage's EBITDA at a 12.00x multiple, Carriage's share price would increase to $73 per share.

Valuation

I used two methods to value Carriage: The first assumes it remains a public company, and the second assumes it is acquired and taken private. I felt this was important because I believe there are equal odds that it stays public or is taken private.

Private Valuation

I spoke to M&A Advisors in the funeral home space, who confirmed that funeral home transactions are valued using EBITDA multiples. Private funeral home groups with 20-40 locations have recently sold for 10-12x EBITDA. As seen in the chart below, SCI is currently valued at 11.99x EBITDA on the public market and Park Lawn is being taken private at 12x EBITDA. Carriage currently trades at 8.60x consolidated EBITDA. If Carriage were to be taken private at the same 12x valuation as the comparable companies, the share price would adjust to $55 per share.

Share Price $55.00 Shares Outstanding 14,838,000 Equity Value $800,053,000 Debt $559,820,000 Cash $1,689,000 Enterprise Value $1,358,184,000 Projected 2024 EBITDA $114,000,000 EV/EBITDA Multiple 12.00x Click to enlarge

Public Valuation

As seen in the chart below, all three public companies are typically valued by the market so that their equity generates an approximate 4%-6% free cash flow return to equity. Carriage's current depressed share valuation yields a 16% cash flow return on equity. For Carriage's cash return to equity to return to both the peer range and its own historical range, the stock will need to be priced at approximately $55 per share.

If we assume Carriage will remain publicly traded for the next three years, it will likely pay down its credit facility and continue to focus on organic growth. In this scenario, we can expect a 4% growth in annual revenue and a 30% EBITDA margin due to an internal focus on cost control and preneed marketing. If all outstanding debt on the credit facility was paid off by 2026, the firm would have an additional $13.5 million in annual income that is passed into net income. If Carriage remains on the public market with only organic growth, I estimate its earnings per share to rise from $2.24 in 2023 to $4.33 in 2026, with this increase largely attributable to Carriage's planned debt paydown.

Conclusion

Carriage's take-private valuation using recent EBITDA multiples implies a $55 per share valuation. Carriage's public valuation, using free cash flow to equity comparable also implies a $55 per share valuation. I believe that no matter the outcome for Carriage's ownership, the company is trading at a significant discount and is due for an increase in price to bring its valuation in line with peers.","About CarriageFounded in 1991, Carriage Services is the second-largest funeral home and cemetery consolidator on the public market.

Investment overview

I give a buy rating to Flex Ltd. (NASDAQ:FLEX). I believe FLEX gives investors direct exposure to two key verticals that have very strong underlying secular tailwinds. These two verticals should improve FLEX's overall growth profile from historical low-single-digits to mid-to-high-single-digits. Coupled with margin expansion (high-growth segments have higher margins), I am expecting FLEX to see earnings growth faster than revenue growth. Lastly, when combined with the shareholder-friendly capital returns track record (5% share buyback rate), I expect EPS to grow to $4.55 in FY29.

Business description

FLEX

FLEX is an electronic manufacturing service [EMS] company that offers outsourced engineering and design, manufacturing, and supply chain services to customers across multiple countries. Breaking down revenue by geography, 26% of revenue comes from Mexico, 19.4% from China, 13.6% from the US, 8% from Malaysia, and the rest from other countries, including Brazil, Hungary, India, and others. By segment, FLEX reports agility solutions (52.7% of FY24 revenue) and reliability (47.3% of total revenue). Agility solutions are verticals such as communications, enterprise and cloud [CEC], lifestyle, and consumer devices. Whereas for reliability, it targets verticals such as automotive, health solutions, and industrials. Of the two, reliability is the segment with higher margins (5.3% vs. 4.8% as of FY24).

Increase demand for data centers is positive for FLEX

FLEX

The increase in demand for AI is a massive tailwind for FLEX, as it drives up the need for more data centers. There are multiple impacts from the rising demand for AI. Firstly, there is a need for more storage space given the huge explosion in the amount of data generated. Secondly, it significantly drives up the amount of computing power required at the edge (i.e., more GPU-accelerated servers). In other words, the world will need a lot more data centers to support the upcoming wave of AI demand. To give a sense of things, in this recent interview with Dell’s CEO, Dell noted that the world could need 100x more data centers in 10 years.

FLEX FLEX

An increase in the number of data centers also means a huge increase in demand for the parts involved, and FLEX benefits directly from this. On FLEX's recent investor day, it was made known that FLEX covers 80% of all the parts a data center requires. This is a very important data point because it means that FLEX is able to capture a large chunk of demand. In the past, it was easy for customers to manage the entire project (building out the servers and shelves in the data center) themselves because there were a lot fewer parts, and they are pretty standard. However, with AI, this has become a lot more complex as more parts are involved. As such, FLEX's capacity to cover a large portion of the required parts makes it more compelling for customers to outsource the entire project to FLEX as it is easier to deal with one vendor (in terms of price negotiation, project management, customization, etc.).

In addition, one major competitive advantage that FLEX has that, I think, will help it capture share is its Flex power pods, which have a lower build cost and shorter lead times. Which means customers are able to scale up a lot faster because of this. According to the presentation, Flex power pods enable an 84% reduction in on-site man-hours during the installation phase and a 75% reduction in the need for assembly and testing. I say this is a competitive advantage, especially in today’s environment because the timeline to build out a data center today is a lot longer than in the past; hence, any opportunity to save time is a major differentiator.

Currently, the data center represents around 11.4% of FY24 revenue and is expected by management to grow at a 20% CAGR over the next 5 years. I believe this growth target may be conservative considering the strong growth expected for AI (~30% CAGR). Comments from other EMS players are also painting the same outlook, which lends credence to the growth outlook.

These declines were offset by strength in connected devices and our AI data center end markets, which today are reported across industrial, cloud and networking end markets. All other end markets are largely in line with previous expectations. More importantly, we remain well-positioned to benefit from many of the world's powerful trends in areas like AI data center infrastructure, healthcare, pharma solutions and automated warehousing to name a few. Jabil 3Q24 earnings For Optical Advanced and Packaging, we're expanding Optical business for AI applications, mainly around 800 gig modules, and we started to do the R&D a new product introduction of 1.6 terabytes. Again, good opportunities here. Growth in cloud and data center will drive the growth for this segment for longer term. Sanmina Corp 2Q24 earnings So, we just see 800-gig demand remaining quite robust. And the rate of growth, it seems like the rate of growth of optical interconnect in these AI data centers, it seems to grow more or less exponentially as these data centers grow. Fabrinet 3Q24 earnings call We are seeing some opportunities around power within AI, potentially within the data center, but also power generation. Last quarter, Oliver highlighted on our call a new win with a multinational company around power generation. Plexus Corp Stifel 2024 Cross Sector Insight Conference

Digitalization of vehicles is another growth tailwind

FLEX

Another huge growth tailwind for FLEX is the digitalization of mobile vehicles. Unlike the past, where there was little software and digitalization involved, cars today (and moving forward) are going to have a lot more of this. Like how AI demand drives up the need for data centers, the digitalization of vehicles also drives up the underlying need for edge computing, storage, and other electronic parts to make the entire architecture work. As assembling these electronic parts is not the expertise of automakers, I believe it makes sense for them to outsource to players like FLEX so that they can focus on designing the end product.

FLEX

According to an estimate by McKinsey, the global automotive software and electronics market is expected to reach $460 billion (~5.5% CAGR, which is 5.5x faster than the automotive market for passenger cars and light commercial vehicles). One reason why I think FLEX will be able to grow faster than the market is because of its unique, flexible business model. I see this as a key differentiator because of the need for more collaboration between players in the value chain due to the growing complexity of the underlying architecture.

As zonal and central compute units consolidate functionality across several domains, the transition to next-generation E/E architectures will likely accelerate the dissolution of functional siloes and boost research into end-to-end customer functionality. Tier-1 players and OEMs will need to collaborate more deeply, starting with common software architecture and middleware solutions, but also through joint development teams in agile settings to ensure frequent releases. This will be enabled by more stringent hardware and software separation and leveraging best practice in systems engineering. With cross-domain applications running on zonal controllers, OEMs will need to invest even more in software integration and validation. Getting ready for next-generation E/E architecture with zonal compute, by McKinsey & Company.

As such, while automotive is now just ~14% of FY24 revenue, I expect this segment to be a growth driver ahead (management guided for a 10% CAGR from FY24 to FY29).

Valuation

May Investing Ideas

Based on my research and analysis, my expected target price for FLEX is ~$61 in FY28, which translates to a 4-year IRR of 20%.

I broke up the revenue into three parts to illustrate which were the main growth drivers. I believe the growth guidance laid out by management is an achievable target given the strong growth tailwinds in the data center and auto vertical. FLEX’s management also has a pretty decent track record of meeting its guidance; hence, I believe their guidance is credible. Over the past 15 quarters, they only missed twice (by a very small margin of 0.39% in 2Q24 and 1.13% in 2Q22), whereas the other quarters beat by 5 to 8% on average. To reiterate, I expect data center revenue to grow at a 20% CAGR through FY29 and auto vertical revenue to grow at 10% over the same period. For the non-high-growth segments, I am less focused on them, given the lack of visible growth catalysts. In modeling them, I used FLEX historical growth rates (between FY11 and FY19) as a benchmark, which is around 2% growth CAGR.

Earnings should grow faster than revenue, as the high-growth segments carry higher margins (as seen from the difference between the reliability and agility segments). Historically, FLEX net margin revolves around the 2.5% level, but that has risen to 3.5% (which I think is largely due to the greater mix of high margin segments). I assume a similar level of 100 bps improvement over the next 5 years (20 bps a year).

Management has been good allocators of capital in terms of returning capital to shareholders, and I expect this to continue at the same rate.

I think it would make sense for FLEX to trade structurally higher than it did in the past because of the better revenue mix and higher margins. I think the market is also starting to recognize this, given the strong multiple re-rating that the stock saw over the past few weeks. Using the recent peak as a potential multiple, I expect FLEX to trade at 13.5x.

Risk

While FLEX has made great strides in shifting its businesses to more predictable end markets, it is still subject to cyclicality in both its legacy consumer electronics business and its new growth areas. In addition, the value proposition of FLEX (or EMS in general) tends to get commoditized over time as the expertise needed to manufacture them will eventually become commoditized. As such, the very long-term growth outlook of the business is hard to model and forecast.

Conclusion

I give a buy rating for FLEX as it benefits from the strong secular trends within its data center and automotive verticals. I expect these tailwinds to drive revenue growth from historical low-single-digits to mid-to-high-single-digits, with earnings growing even faster due to higher margins in these segments. The risk lies in the very long-term outlook, where the assembly and manufacturing of today’s complex parts become commoditized.","I believe FLEX gives investors direct exposure to two key verticals that have very strong underlying secular tailwinds.

By Mike Larson

It’s official: The first half of 2024 is over... and the second half is getting underway. That makes now a great time to look back at which assets are winning the performance race, which are bringing up the rear, and which are stuck somewhere in between.

Here’s the MoneyShow Chart of the Week to break it all down for you!

Data by YCharts

Technology stocks get all the press, and it’s easy to see why with the Invesco QQQ Trust (QQQ) spinning off a total return of 17.3% year-to-date. But the United States Oil Fund (USO) actually delivered the best performance of the ETFs I tracked: +19.4%. Go figure.

The SPDR S&P 500 ETF Trust (SPY) notched a gain of 15.2%, while the SPDR Gold Shares ETF (GLD) returned 12.4%. In part because the dollar rallied strongly - with the Invesco DB US Dollar Index Bullish Fund (UUP) up 7.5% - global markets didn’t fare as well as US ones. The iShares MSCI ACWI ex US Index Fund (ACWX), a benchmark ETF for non-US markets, rose just 5.6% in H1.

Here at home, you know the drill: “Old Economy” stocks and small caps haven’t been keeping up with their flashier, bigger-cap brethren. That’s why the SPDR Dow Jones Industrial Average ETF (DIA) managed a gain of just 4.7%, while the iShares Russell 2000 ETF (IWM) rose a paltry 1.6%.

As for bonds? It’s a mixed bag. Riskier bonds clearly outperformed credit risk-free government debt, with the SPDR Bloomberg High Yield Bond ETF (JNK) closing out H1 with a 2.3% gain... while the iShares 20+ Year Treasury Bond ETF (TLT) lost 5.6%.

As for S&P 500 sectors (not shown above)? The Communication Services Select Sector SPDR Fund (XLC) came in first place with a return of 19.6%, followed by the Technology Select Sector SPDR Fund (XLK) at plus-17.9%. The Real Estate Select Sector SPDR Fund (XLRE) was the only one of 11 sector funds to lose money at minus-2.4%. Second-worst was the Consumer Discretionary Select Sector SPDR Fund (XLY) with a 2.4% gain.

What’s the message from the Chart of the Week and the data accompanying it? The market remains in bull mode, with offensive sectors and assets outperforming defensive ones. We could use better market breadth. But the lack of it isn’t a rally killer by itself.

Unless and until the positive tone and data changes course, I’m sticking with the bullish story I’ve been telling since the beginning of 2023. Be bold. Stay bold.

Johnson Outdoors Inc. (NASDAQ:JOUT), the outdoors recreational products manufacturer, has continued to post weak financials amid a weak industry and an unsustainably high inventory level.

I previously wrote an article on the company, titled “Johnson Outdoors: Lower Price Isn’t Attractive Enough Yet”. In the article, I analyzed Johnson Outdoors’ temporary headwinds, and initiated the stock at Hold due to a successful turnaround not bringing enough upside in terms of the valuation.

Since the article was published on the 22nd of December in 2023, the stock has lost -31% of its value compared to S&P 500’s return of 15% in the same period as the weak financials have pushed investors’ faith in a great turnaround. The valuation is starting to get more attractive, although high alertness is still needed as the weakness continues.

My Rating History on JOUT (Seeking Alpha)

The Financial Weakness Continues

After my prior article, Johnson Outdoors has reported its H1/FY2024 financials. In Q1, the company reported a revenue decrease of -22.3%, better than the incredibly weak -50.9% that Johnson Outdoors had in Q4. Afterwards, Q2 followed with a revenue decline of -13.0%, again showing sequential improvements in year-over-year comparisons but continuing to experience weak demand. The most severe declines have so far been experienced in the camping and watercraft recreation segments as the segments’ revenues declined by over a third in FY2023.

Due to the weak demand, the gross margin has continued to perform poorly, and decreased by 2.4 percentage points year-over-year in Q2 into 34.9% as bloated inventories and lower demand require more promotional activity and push for lower overall pricing power. The inventories still stand at $249.2 million, 164% above the $94.3 million level at the end of FY2019.

As a result of the continued financial pressure, Johnson Outdoors’ trailing operating income now stands at a negative -$5.3 million – improvements in earnings haven’t been seen so far, but are critical in the future. For the time being, Johnson Outdoors expects the challenges to continue in the currently tough industry, as told in the Q2 earnings call. Short-term improvements shouldn’t be expected, but a mid-term recovery should still happen with an industry recovery.

How High Will Earnings Bounce?

The financial turbulence has caused low visibility into Johnson Outdoors’ sustainable earnings level - an eventual recovery is highly likely, but the earnings outlook is still cloudy.

Using the US BLS’s CPI calculator, consumer prices have had an inflation of 21.6% from Johnson Outdoors’ FY2019 end into March 2024, the end of the company’s Q2. Assuming stable sales in real terms, revenues would now stand at $684.2 million instead of $597.9 million. The quite recent divestiture of Military and Commercial Tents and the prior Eureka! product line abandonment could affect real sales negatively, though – a 5% smaller estimate of $650.0 million is fairer in my opinion.

Johnson Outdoors’ FY2015-FY2019 pre-pandemic average gross margin was 42.5%, 5.7 percentage points above the current level. Assuming a recovery into the average level, normalized gross profit would be $276.2 million.

Author's Calculation Using TIKR Data

Subtracting the current trailing operating expenses of $225.6 million from the gross profit, the normalized operating income would stand at $50.6 million, working as a baseline expectation after a mid-term recovery representing a 7.8% margin.

The earnings outlook is still turbulent, and the normalized earnings level could end up significantly different than I anticipate. Johnson Outdoors has related to increased competition in the Q2 press release, potentially lowering the estimate. Also, the normalized earnings shouldn’t be expected in the short term as weakness seems to continue. With Johnson Outdoors’ excessive inventory level, the gross margin could be left at a lower level for quite some time before notable improvements.

On the other hand, Johnson Outdoors has achieved some growth prior to the pandemic as well, potentially making the sales expectation too conservative.

The Valuation Is Getting More Attractive

Modeling a three-year recovery into the estimated earnings recovery level, my discounted cash flow [DCF] model sees quite major changes – I now estimate a mid-term recovery into revenues of $676.3 million in FY2026, after which the growth phases out into perpetual 2% growth, assuming my estimated current $650 million sustainable level and slight continued inflation.

With the sales recovery, I also estimate the EBIT to increase. I estimate margins to stay abnormally low from FY2024 to FY2026, partly due to continued low demand, but also due to the lower inventories that require more promotional activity. The eventual 7.8% EBIT margin level represents my sustainable margin estimate. The cash flow conversion should be good especially in the next couple of years as the inventories decrease.

DCF Model (Author's Calculation)

The estimates put Johnson Outdoors’s fair value estimate at $45.38, nearly 30% above the stock price at the time of writing – after the stock price has fallen, the stock is starting to get attractive. I still believe that caution is needed as earnings continue to decline, though, as my financial estimates could well turn out to be wrong.

A weighted average cost of capital of 11.87% is used in the DCF model. The used WACC is derived from a capital asset pricing model:

CAPM (Author's Calculation)

I continue estimating no interest-bearing debt. To estimate the cost of equity, I use the 10-year bond yield of 4.39% as the risk-free rate. The equity risk premium of 4.60% is Professor Aswath Damodaran’s estimate for the US, updated on the 5th of January. I believe that the beta of 1.90 may be too pessimistic – I now estimate the beta at the 1.56 average of the previous 1.90 beta, Vista Outdoor’s (VSTO) 1.21 beta, and Solo Brands’ (DTC) 1.57 beta as they represent Johnson Outdoors’ offering better than my previous predominantly marine comparisons. With a liquidity premium of 0.3%, the cost of equity and WACC both stand at 11.87%.

Takeaway

Johnson Outdoors has continued to report weak revenues and margins as low demand continues and as the company’s excessive inventories require lower gross margins. The company doesn’t see a short-term recovery ahead, either. I believe that a good mid-term recovery should still happen, elevating earnings into a reasonably good level. The recovery could now represent an attractive opportunity at the lower price, but due to the remaining uncertainty and weak short-term outlook, I remain at a Hold rating.","I previously wrote an article on the company, titled “Johnson Outdoors: Lower Price Isn’t Attractive Enough Yet”.
My Rating History on JOUT (Seeking Alpha)The Financial Weakness ContinuesAfter my prior article, Johnson Outdoors has reported its H1/FY2024 financials.
In Q1, the company reported a revenue decrease of -22.3%, better than the incredibly weak -50.9% that Johnson Outdoors had in Q4.
With Johnson Outdoors’ excessive inventory level, the gross margin could be left at a lower level for quite some time before notable improvements.
On the other hand, Johnson Outdoors has achieved some growth prior to the pandemic as well, potentially making the sales expectation too conservative.","['nasdaqjout', 'estimate', 'johnson', 'lower', 'gross', 'earnings', 'weak', 'recovery', 'million', 'level', 'patiently', 'fishing', 'outdoors']",https://static.seekingalpha.com/cdn/s3/uploads/getty_images/1417601666/image_1417601666.jpg?io=getty-c-w1536,,glebchikistock via getti imag johnson outdoor inc nasdaqjout outdoor recreat product manufactur continu post weak financi amid weak industri unsustain high inventori level previous wrote articl compani titl `` johnson outdoor lower price is n't attract enough yet '' articl analyz johnson outdoor ' temporari headwind initi stock hold due success turnaround bring enough upsid term valuat sinc articl publish nd decemb stock lost valu compar sp 's return period weak financi push investor ' faith great turnaround valuat start get attract although high alert still need weak continu rate histori jout financi weak continu prior articl johnson outdoor report hfi financi q compani report revenu decreas better incred weak johnson outdoor q afterward q follow revenu declin show sequenti improv yearoveryear comparison continu experi weak demand sever declin far experienc camp watercraft recreat segment segment ' revenu declin third fy due weak demand gross margin continu perform poor decreas percentag point yearoveryear q bloat inventori lower demand requir promot activ push lower overal price power inventori still stand million million level end fy result continu financi pressur johnson outdoor ' trail oper incom stand negat million - improv earn have n't seen far critic futur time be johnson outdoor expect challeng continu current tough industri told q earn call shortterm improv should n't expect midterm recoveri still happen industri recoveri high earn bounc financi turbul caus low visibl johnson outdoor ' sustain earn level eventu recoveri high like earn outlook still cloudi use us bls 's cpi calcul consum price inflat johnson outdoor ' fy end march end compani 's q assum stabl sale real term revenu would stand million instead million quit recent divestitur militari commerci tent prior eureka product line abandon could affect real sale negat though - smaller estim million fairer opinion johnson outdoor ' fyfi prepandem averag gross margin percentag point current level assum recoveri averag level normal gross profit would million author calcul use tikr data subtract current trail oper expens million gross profit normal oper incom would stand million work baselin expect midterm recoveri repres margin earn outlook still turbul normal earn level could end signific differ anticip johnson outdoor relat increas competit q press releas potenti lower estim also normal earn should n't expect short term weak seem continu johnson outdoor ' excess inventori level gross margin could left lower level quit time notabl improv hand johnson outdoor achiev growth prior pandem well potenti make sale expect conserv valuat get attract model threeyear recoveri estim earn recoveri level discount cash flow dcf model see quit major chang - estim midterm recoveri revenu million fy growth phase perpetu growth assum estim current million sustain level slight continu inflat sale recoveri also estim ebit increas estim margin stay abnorm low fy fy part due continu low demand also due lower inventori requir promot activ eventu ebit margin level repres sustain margin estim cash flow convers good especi next coupl year inventori decreas dcf model author calcul estim put johnson outdoor 's fair valu estim near stock price time write - stock price fallen stock start get attract still believ caution need earn continu declin though financi estim could well turn wrong weight averag cost capit use dcf model use wacc deriv capit asset price model capm author calcul continu estim interestbear debt estim cost equiti use year bond yield riskfre rate equiti risk premium professor aswath damodaran 's estim us updat th januari believ beta may pessimist - estim beta averag previous beta vista outdoor 's vsto beta solo brand ' dtc beta repres johnson outdoor ' offer better previous predomin marin comparison liquid premium cost equiti wacc stand takeaway johnson outdoor continu report weak revenu margin low demand continu compani 's excess inventori requir lower gross margin compani doe n't see shortterm recoveri ahead either believ good midterm recoveri still happen elev earn reason good level recoveri could repres attract opportun lower price due remain uncertainti weak shortterm outlook remain hold rate

The S&P continues driving higher, powered 35% by the incredible growth story of Nvidia (NVDA).

One of the reasons that investors are bullish - the prospects for Fed cuts.

CME Group

The bond market is pricing in four cuts in the next year. If it happens, that could benefit rate-sensitive parts of the economy, but there likely isn't as much upside to large-cap US stocks as some investors might think.

There are plenty of ways that stocks can go up over the coming years, and some even include fundamentals, not just bubble manias.

For example, Tom Lee of Fundstrat believes the S&P's earnings growth will be stronger than expected at 12% to 15%. This, combined with a 1.35% dividend yield, would justify 13.4% to 16.4% annual returns for stocks.

Potential Overvaluation (10-Year Average) S&P 10-Year Average Cash-Adjusted PEG S&P Current Cash-Adjusted PEG -30.48% 1.77 1.23 Potential Overvaluation (25-Year Average) S&P 20-Year Average S&P Current Cash-Adjusted PEG -49.15% 2.42 1.23 Click to enlarge

(Source: Dividend Kings S&P Valuation Tool)

From there, he believes the S&P's PEG ratio will rise by around 30% from 1.23 to 1.6, near the 10-year average cash-adjusted PEG ratio of 1.77.

That equals approximately a 23X forward PE on the S&P, which is historically very high but potentially justified if US corporations can drive 12% to 15% growth through 2030.

But remember that all models are wrong, though some are useful.

The assumptions of a model are critical to whether the results are anywhere close to reality.

The Morningstar bottom-up consensus is 11.8% for the next five years.

In other words, take every company in the S&P 500 and then ask its Morningstar analyst what is the five-year growth rate. Weight by market cap, and you get an 11.8% forecasted growth rate.

FactSet S&P Bottom-Up Growth Consensus: 12.6% CAGR EPS Growth From 2023 to 2026

FactSet Research Terminal

FactSet Research's John Butler reports that the bottom-up growth forecast from every Wall Street analyst has been 92% over the last 20 years.

For example, take the median earnings/cash flow forecast for every company in the S&P and weight them by market cap. For two decades, the expected growth rates have typically been within 8% of those expectations.

That's the power of aggregating the 3,100 sell-side analysts who cover America's companies.

In other words, 11% to 13% medium-term growth rates are expected, and Tom Lee believes that AI and four other technologies could accelerate US growth by up to 1.8%, driving 15% EPS growth through 2030.

Will all this expected growth (or speculative AI growth) come through? Then, anyone owning the S&P or Nasdaq will likely do very well.

S&P Free Cash Flow Expected To Grow 50% In The Next 3 Years

If S&P earnings grow at 15% annually for 5.5 years, then stocks will do well. Is that possible?

FactSet Research Terminal

The 12 largest growth stocks have a 15% growth consensus, thanks to an expected $3.5 trillion in growth spending.

Assuming their 28% free cash flow return on invested capital over the last 12 months is maintained, expected growth spending would triple annual free cash flow from $500 billion to $1.5 trillion by 2030, a 22% annualized growth rate in free cash flow.

If large-cap growth can indeed grow free cash flow by that rate, as indicated by FactSet's bottom-up cash flow acceleration forecast, stocks are not likely overvalued as they appear today.

S&P 500 Free Cash Flow Growth Consensus

2023: 3% free cash flow growth

2024: 12% free cash flow growth consensus

2025: 15% free cash flow growth consensus

2026: 17% free cash flow growth consensus

Growth Consensus Through 2026: 14.5% CAGR

50% FCF Growth For S&P Through 2026

The FactSet consensus is for free cash flow to outpace EPS growth by 2% to 3% per year through 2026.

If that ratio holds in Tom Lee's scenario, then his ""bold call"" for 20% CAGR returns for the S&P through 2030 would be powered by 13% to 18% annual free cash flow growth plus 1.35% yield or 14.4% to 19.4% CAGR FCF justified returns with even more modest multiple expansion required.

What happens if growth misses expectations?

Then big-cap tech and the S&P, in general, could be in trouble.

Margin Of Safety: The Anti-Speculation Investing Principle

Price is my due diligence."" - Warren Buffett

The idea of value investing is buying with a margin of safety.

Bubbles require making assumptions that are unlikely or even impossible.

Anti-bubbles require making equally extreme assumptions about companies to the downside.

Right now, big tech can do no wrong.

Magnificent 7 Growth Rates: 19% Annual Growth In Free Cash Flow

FactSet Research Terminal

But a lot of that expected growth is priced into stocks right now.

Remember that growth doesn't matter; what matters is what growth is priced into stocks.

That happened with Micron (MU), which announced sensational results, beating earnings expectations by 17%.

Micron's earnings came in 7% above the highest analyst estimate. By any measure, beating the most bullish analyst by 7% and the median estimate by 17% is a blowout earnings result.

Guidance? Management now expects 30% capex growth from big tech giants next year.

This Company Just Beat Earnings By 17%

Seeking Alpha

And the price fell 6% because the stock was pricing in blowout results and then some.

The Opportunity In Small Cap Value

Small-cap stocks are trading at a 30% historical discount.

Small caps have struggled with higher interest rates because large companies have stronger credit ratings, generate more free cash flow, and thus have less borrowing needs.

Charlie Bilello

Berkshire (BRK.A) (BRK.B) is generating $1 billion per month in risk-free net interest income.

Magnificent 7 Is Getting $28 Billion Per Year In Risk-Free Income From the US Government.

Perplexity Pro

When rates come down, the borrowing cost for small companies will fall, with the net difference between small and large companies compressing from today's elevated levels.

In other words, while big companies will always benefit from lower borrowing costs than small companies, the direction and rate of change in borrowing costs is expected to drive acceleration to double-digit earnings growth.

Small Cap Deep Value (NASDAQ:SFLO) Growth Consensus.

FactSet Research Terminal

The S&P is expected to see 12% EPS growth in 2026.

So are small-cap deep value stocks, but look at the difference in valuation.

FactSet Research Terminal

12% growth for 5X forward EV/EBITDA (cash-adjusted earnings).

FactSet Research Terminal

12% growth for a 14X forward cash-adjusted PE.

That's a 9X lower valuation for a similar consensus growth rate, at least for the next year or two.

VictoryShares Small Cap Free Cash Flow: The Best Buffett-Style Deep Value ETF You've Never Heard Of

Free cash flow yield is the best value metric of the last 33 years.

Pacer Funds

Since 1990, free cash flow divided by enterprise value (market cap + net debt) has been the best valuation metric, resulting in the best annual returns and the lowest annual volatility.

The best and most consistent returns, with 2X better volatility-adjusted returns of the broader stock market.

Buffett historically doubled the S&P's returns, and this value strategy has done the same regarding volatility-adjusted returns for the last 33 years.

Pacer Funds

Value investing didn't stop working; it was just hidden by investors looking at the wrong thing, like book value.

Pacer US Cash Cows 100 ETF (COWZ) is the first ETF that utilized FCF yield, and it's by far the largest and most popular.

Historical COWZ Returns Confirm That ""Value Investing Isn't Dead""

Portfolio Visualizer Premium

Since January 2017, the Pacer US Cash Cows 100 ETF, which uses FCF yield to select deep-value large-cap stocks, has delivered equal to slightly superior returns to the S&P and Russell 1000.

VictoryShares Free Cash Flow ETF (VFLO) takes the proven approach of free cash flow yield and deep value investing and applies a growth screen to it.

VictoryShares

VFLO's strategy of taking the highest free cash flow yield of the S&P 400, eliminating the 25 slowest growers, and weighting by free cash flow yield has historically beaten COWZ's pure FCF yield approach.

VictoryShares

FCF yield inherently focuses on quality companies, highly profitable ones, and also undervalued ones.

VictoryShares

Then, using a growth screen that blends 50% trailing growth with 50% consensus future growth to eliminate the slowest-growing companies, VictoryShares believes it has created an approach that, at least historically, delivered 17% to 18% annual returns.

155X returns since 1990 vs 22X returns for the S&P 500.

And with lower volatility along the way.

SFLO: An ETF Whose Time May Have Come

You may have heard small caps are a proven alpha factor.

Ploutos

That's both true and not true.

Alpha Architect

For long-only portfolios, value explains the entire historical outperformance of small caps.

In other words, valuation makes the difference if you're not shorting large caps and going long small caps (and I would never recommend shorting large caps).

FactSet Research

S&P EV/EBITDA: 14.

VFLO: 7

SFLO: 5

The balance sheets of SFLO and VFLO are similarly strong. By 2026, they're expected to be net debt free, with 12% EPS growth, and they trade for 5X cash-adjusted earnings today.

VictoryShares

The current FCF yield on the 200-stock SFLO portfolio is exceptional: Almost 10% or a 10X EV/FCF with nearly 12% growth rates.

Morningstar expects SFLO's portfolio to grow earnings at 13% per year.

FactSet confirms similar growth estimates in the medium-term through 2026.

Risks To Consider

VictoryShares

This is what the SFLO portfolio looks like. It's highly diversified but also highly cyclical.

The downside of small caps is that they are no-moat companies with weaker financials.

That makes them such potentially coiled springs, trading at 5X cash-adjusted earnings and 10% FCF yields.

Their returns on invested capital of 14% are a fraction of larger value companies or the S&P.

The same is true in terms of free cash flow margins.

Investing Style Wide Moats Return On Invested Capital Free Cash Flow Margin IWY 86.74 34.6 35.96 Nasdaq 74.14 27.3 36.82 S&P 66.51 25.78 31.44 VFLO 9.65 14.42 13.58 COWZ 8.81 10.35 9.16 SFLO 0.73 13.75 9.13 Click to enlarge

(Source: Morningstar)

There's no question that the quality of the growth giants is far superior to that of value companies, even the large-cap ones that COWZ and VFLO target.

The risk is that in a slower economy or a higher-for-longer environment, the large growth giants' superior balance sheets and cost-of-capital advantage will simply overwhelm the companies SFLO is buying.

What about rebalancing risk?

There's less of this than VFLO.

VFLO targets 50 companies out of the S&P 400, while SFLO targets 200 companies out of an investing universe of 2,500.

The turnover should be lower, and since it's closer to an equal-weight design, the stability of that portfolio should be superior to COWZ or VFLO.

However, we can't forget that high free cash flow investing usually focuses on cyclical companies.

In other words, the reason Morningstar and FactSet are forecasting 13% growth and the historical growth rate is 16% might not be a sustainable 13% growth rate.

Finally, we can't forget that VictoryShares is a relatively new company, and SFLO is a brand-new ETF.

Ycharts

VFLO has been beating COWZ since inception, keeping up with the market, and even beating it for a stretch.

As expected, COWZ has been outperforming traditional value since VTV primarily uses book value, an objectively worse value metric than FCF yield.

Ycharts

Since rates are high, small caps have suffered, and SFLO has thus far trailed COWZ, SFLO, Value stocks, and the S&P.

Bottom Line: If You Want The Best Value, SFLO Appears To Offer It

Anyone buying SFLO will want to size their position appropriately for their risk profile.

Theoretically, a 9% FCF yield and 13% EPS growth might combine to generate up to 22% long-term returns, the highest return potential of any ETF I've ever encountered.

Small caps are a coiled spring.

Value is the lowest relative valuation vs. growth in 25 years, and small-cap value, like SFLO, is trading at extreme valuations that could potentially deliver explosive upside should these companies deliver their 12% to 13% consensus growth rates.

It's important to remember the quality gap between small-cap value and growth titans is vast.

However, the question is whether 5X EV/EBITDA for small caps growing 13% is a better value than large growth stocks trading at 17X EV/EBITDA growing 15%.

The expected growth rates are similar, and the difference in valuation is more than 3X.

So, the question is whether falling rates and a healthy economy can combine to create a historic small-cap value rally.

If you believe in mean reversion, SFLO could be the fattest ETF pitch, with valuations on par with small-cap emerging market companies.

But rather than take the risks of owning foreign companies in small economies with questionable shareholder rights, you can own 200 US companies trading at valuations currently pricing in about -7% growth.","S&P 500 Free Cash Flow Growth Consensus2023: 3% free cash flow growth2024: 12% free cash flow growth consensus2025: 15% free cash flow growth consensus2026: 17% free cash flow growth consensusGrowth Consensus Through 2026: 14.5% CAGR50% FCF Growth For S&P Through 2026The FactSet consensus is for free cash flow to outpace EPS growth by 2% to 3% per year through 2026.

Seeking Alpha,https://seekingalpha.com/article/4701923-crown-castle-value-trap?source=feed_all_articles,2024-07-02,11:00:00 UTC,Crown Castle: Value Trap? (NYSE:CCI),"AlexSecret

Since 2011 when the Internal Revenue Service (‘IRS’) agreed to classify cell towers as real property, the REIT sector has mushroomed.

American Tower (AMT) was the first public company to convert from a C-Corp to REIT (2011) and later Crown Castle (NYSE:CCI) – in 2014 – and SBA Communications (SBAC) – in 2017 – joined REIT-dom.

As you can see below, Crown Castle has underperformed these two peers (since 2017):

Yahoo Finance

Also, over the last two years, CCI has underperformed:

Yahoo Finance

CCI has underperformed over six months:

Yahoo Finance

Given the underperformance with CCI, I thought that it would be a great time to take a deep look at the REIT to consider whether or not to allocate more capital to the name.

The Basic Business Model

Crown Castle owns and leases vertical infrastructure to wireless carriers in the US. The large majority of revenues come from AT&T (T), Verizon (VZ), T-Mobile and DISH.

Crown Castle owns the tower and leases out space on lease contracts that are typically 10 to 15 years.

Most of these contracts have built-in lease escalators of around 3%. Churn is around 1% to 2% so these escalators more than make up for the churn.

Crown Castle owns around 40,000 towers (all located within the US).

CCI IR

The primary drivers for Crown Castle’s business include the company’s diverse offering of cell towers, small cells, and fiber solutions.

CCI IR

The company intends to drive organic growth by leasing out its existing 40,000 towers and 85K route of high-capacity fiber.

CCI IR

The U.S. represents the best overall market for wireless infrastructure due to strong fundamentals.

Higher demand for data and the ability for consumers to pay for wireless attracts a disproportionate share of global network capital investment.

North America accounts for 30% of expected global wireless capex through 2025 while accounting for roughly 5% of the world’s population.

CCI IR

The growth outlook looks solid as mobile data (growth) requires significant network investment for both towers and small cells.

Capex spend in the tower sector is steady at $30 billion annually to keep pace with rapid mobile data demand that's expected to grow by 21% annually through 2027.

5G network spend should exceed 4G spend and continue to drive demand for cell tower assets.

CCI IR

A New Sheriff in Town

Crown Castle has a new CEO.

In early April, Steven Moskowitz was appointed to lead the company as CEO and president. He has worked in the tower industry for more than 25 years, including 12 years at American Tower.

His fresh viewpoint on the company has the potential to improve performance at the cell tower landlord, but it will likely take some time before a significant increase is made to the bottom line.

More recently, CCI management increased AFFO per share guidance from $6.85 - $6.97 to $6.71- $7.02 per share. The company said it “will reduce discretionary capital expenditures going forward, and believes it can improve capital efficiency while achieving annual organic revenue growth of 2% in 2024.”

In doing so, CCI said it will reduce gross capex in its fiber segment by $275 million to $325 million. In addition, the company plans layoffs and office closures to generate around $100 million in annualized run-rate cost savings (around $60 million in 2024).

Moskowitz has his plate full.

In February, Ted Miller, co-founder, nominated four candidates to the board and outlined a plan to revamp operations, including selling the fiber assets. He wasn’t happy that activist investor Elliott Management was forcing two board seats.

On May 22 CCI announced that based on preliminary information from the CCI proxy solicitor, the entire slate of 12 nominees had been elected to the board of directors at the 2024 Annual Meeting of Stockholders. CCI issued this statement:

“We thank our shareholders for the trust they have placed in our highly qualified board members as they oversee the creation of a stronger, more valuable Crown Castle. Along with our new CEO, Steven Moskowitz, the board continues to take action, including conducting the strategic and operational review of our fiber and small cell business already underway, to improve performance and unlock shareholder value.”

The Latest Quarter Results

We see challenges persisting in Q2-24 for Crown Castle.

Revenue during Q1-24 decreased YOY and most analysts expect this trend to continue throughout 2024.

In fact, we expect Q2-24 revenue of around $1.65 billion, a decrease of about 5% in 2024 ($6.6 billion).

During March, site revenues dropped 2% to $1.6 billion.

Management is also forecasting site rental revenues to fall 2% YOY and net income to decline by 17%. Q1-24 net income fell 26%.

As seen below, AFFO also fell from $828 million in Q1-23 to $749 million in A1-24:

CCI IR

The company cited a $50 million reduction in site rental revenues related to Sprint cancellations, a $54 million reduction in non-cash items, straight-line revenue and prepaid rent amortization.

In addition, the company referenced a $26 million decrease in services margin contribution due to lower tower activity. At a recent conference, CCI management said,

“As part of that consolidation, we negotiated an outcome with Sprint - with T-Mobile, where all of the churn of our towers, all of the revenue reduction of our towers, they would get through rationalizing their network footprint would happen at the beginning of 2025. So we expect about $200 million of revenue to decrease to come off our books in the beginning of 2025.”

We believe that a turnaround could occur after the company completes the review of its fiber business and determines how to optimize its enterprise fiber and small cell operations.

CCI said its full-year outlook remains unchanged and “reflects a year-over-year decrease in site rental revenues, adjusted EBITDA, and AFFO due to the non-cash and one-time items.”

The Balance Sheet

CCI has been an investment grade (‘BBB’) borrower since 2015 and during that time the company has strengthened its balance sheet by extending debt maturities from five to seven years (as seen below).

Also, the company has decreased the percentage of secured debt from 47% to 6%, and increased the percentage of fixed rate debt from 68% to 90%.

CCI IR

CCI ended Q1-24 with approximately $6 billion of availability under its revolver and only $2 billion of debt maturities occurring through 2025, providing ample liquidity.

CCI’s target leverage is 5x debt to EBITDA, and that’s around 5.5x now. The company should be able to organically grow revenue and EBITDA to pull that leverage back down to target leverage levels.

The All-Important Dividend

Although Crown Castle has a history of raising dividends, payments have been flat from 2023 to 2024.

Management indicated that a raise would not occur in 2024 but intends to keep distributions as a high priority.

At this juncture, capital appreciation potential is above average over the next three to five years.

Now, as you can see below, CCI’s dividend is not as safe as it’s been in the past. The payout ratio is around 90% in 2024:

The Future?

Analysts are forecasting CCI to grow by -8% in 2024, -2% in 2025 and +3% in 2026:

Using consensus estimates, this puts the 2025 payout ratio at 92%:

This does not leave the company with much of a buffer…

Especially when you consider the consensus growth with American Tower:

Valuation

As you can see below, CCI is trading at 13.5x P/AFFO:

While the valuation appears cheap, remember that the payout ratio is elevated (90%) and the growth forecasts for 2024 and 2025 are negative.

While we don’t view Crown Castle as a value trap, we believe the better opportunity is with American Tower.

Recently, I saw the news that Laurentian Bank's (TSX:LB:CA) peer, Canadian Western Bank (CWB:CA), was being acquired by National Bank of Canada (NA:CA). Since the two banks are similar in size, C$48.4 billion in total assets for Laurentian vs. C$42.0 billion for Canadian Western, my immediate thought was whether Laurentian will be next in line to be acquired in the current consolidation wave.

However, after reviewing the NA/CWB transaction and Laurentian's latest results, I believe there are reasons Laurentian failed to find a suitor last year. The bank does not have attractive assets that warrant a takeover attempt by its Big-6 competitors.

As a standalone bank, Laurentian continues to struggle financially, reporting a massive impairment and restructuring charge in the latest quarter. Until I see signs of improvement in the bank's efficiency and profitability, I recommend investors stay on the sidelines despite the bank's cheap valuations.

(Author's note, all financial figures in this article are in Canadian dollars)

Brief Company Overview

For those not familiar, Laurentian Bank is Canada's 8th largest bank (after RBC acquired HSBC Bank of Canada). Laurentian primarily operates in the provinces of Quebec, Ontario, Alberta, British Columbia, and Nova Scotia (Figure 1).

Figure 1 - Top 10 banks in Canada (wallstreetmojo)

Laurentian is known as a personal and commercial lender, focused on small and medium enterprises, with an ancillary capital markets business focused on niche verticals like green and social bonds (Figure 2).

Figure 2 - LB loan portfolio mix, October 2023 (LB annual report)

Another Wave Of Consolidation In Canadian Banking?

Unlike the United States with more than 4,000 commercial banks, the Canadian banking landscape is highly concentrated with the Big 6 (RBC, TD, Scotia, BMO, CIBC, NA) commercial banks dominating the market for loans and deposits.

Despite the oligopolistic market structure, Canadian banking regulators appear unconcerned about further consolidation, as they recently allowed RBC to acquire the assets of HSBC Bank of Canada.

In recent weeks, we have also seen National Bank announce the acquisition of Canadian Western Bank in a $5 billion transaction, as mentioned at the beginning of this article (Figure 3).

Figure 3 - NA to acquire CWB for C$5 billion (NA investor presentation)

Rationale For NA/CWB Transaction

For National Bank, its rationale for acquiring Canadian Western makes a lot of strategic sense. CWB is a commercially focused bank specializing in business and personal banking, equipment financing, trust services, and wealth management. Most importantly, CWB has a strong presence in Western Canada, where National is historically weak. CWB will add 39 branches to National's network, with virtually no overlap (Figure 4).

Figure 4 - CWB has a complementary branch network (NA investor presentation)

CWB will also enhance National's revenue diversification by bolstering its commercial loan book by 52% (Figure 5).

Figure 5 - CWB increases NA's commercial loans (NA investor presentation)

Laurentian Left With No Dance Partner

Unfortunately, upon further reflection, I do not believe Laurentian will be the subject of any takeover attempts in the near future. First, readers should recall my article from last summer, when Laurentian put itself up for sale by announcing a strategic review process.

Unfortunately, after likely inviting every Big 6 bank and other financial institution that may be interested in Laurentian into its data room, the bank's strategic review was concluded in September without a deal.

In my opinion, the primary issue with any Laurentian takeover is that Laurentian does not have any assets of significant value to its Big-6 competitors. For example, while CWB has a complementary network of bank branches in Western Canada that appealed to National Bank, Laurentian's branches are predominantly located in Eastern Canada, which overlap with many of the Big 6 banks.

Niche Businesses Not Big Enough To Warrant Takeover

Furthermore, while Laurentian does have a leadership position in certain niche business lines such as inventory and equipment financing, these businesses are likely not large enough to warrant a full-scale takeover of the bank itself (Figure 6).

Figure 6 - LB has leadership in niche areas (LB investor presentation)

That is why Laurentian will likely have to struggle alone in its 'Path Forward'.

Lagging Fundamentals Warrant Discounted Valuations

On the positive side, Laurentian Bank does trade at very discounted valuations. At a recent price of $26.55, Laurentian is trading at 0.45x Price-to-Book value (""P/B""), 1/3 to 1/2 of its Big-6 bank peers (Figure 7).

Figure 7 - LB vs. peer valuations (Seeking Alpha)

However, I believe Laurentian's discounted valuation may be warranted as the bank is sub-scale and earns significantly lower return-on-equity (""ROE"") and return-on-assets (""ROA"") compared to its peers (Figure 8).

Figure 8 - LB vs. peer profitability (Seeking Alpha)

Recent Quarter Continues To Show Laurentian Struggling

For example, in the most recently reported Q2/F24 earnings, Laurentian reported a large loss of $2.71 / share, as the bank had to take $197 million in impairment and restructuring charges related to its Personal and Commercial (""P&C"") segment (Figure 9).

Figure 9 - LB Q2/F24 financial summary (LB Q2/F24 MD&A)

Looking at the details, Laurentian recorded $156 million in goodwill impairment charges to its P&C business, along with $41 million in restructuring charges for the bank as a whole (Figure ). This puts into question the quality of historical management decisions since goodwill impairment arises from past acquisitions.

Figure 10 - LB impairment details (LB Q2/F24 MD&A)

Investors are reminded that the current CEO, Eric Provost, was formerly EVP of Commercial Banking and President of the Quebec market, so he shares some of the blame for these historical acquisitions (Figure 11).

Figure 11 - Current CEO, Eric Provost, was formerly head of Commercial Banking and President of the Quebec market (LB investor presentation)

Even adjusting for the charges, Laurentian reported a 22% YoY decline in YTD adjusted earnings to $1.80 / share, and a peer-lagging efficiency ratio of 73.4% (Figure 11).

Figure 11 - LB adjusted Q2/F24 financial performance shows continued deterioration (LB Q2/F24 MD&A)

Simply put, despite management's bravado, Laurentian still has a very long way to go to achieve management's goal of double-digit EPS growth, double-digit ROE, and sub-60% efficiency (Figure 12).

Figure 12 - Laurentian's ambitious medium-term targets (company reports)

Conclusion

Recently, National Bank of Canada announced the acquisition of Canadian Western Bank, sparking speculation of further consolidation in Canadian banking. However, after reviewing the NA/CWB transaction and Laurentian's latest results, I believe there is a reason Laurentian's strategy review came up empty last year.

Simply put, the bank is a sub-scale lender with assets that overlap with its peers. This makes any Big-6 bank acquisition of Laurentian hard to justify.

As a standalone entity, Laurentian continues to struggle financially, with the bank recording a massive impairment and restructuring charge in the latest quarter. While management has ambitious goals of improving efficiency and profitability in the medium term, so far, I have seen no evidence of the company's strategy coming to fruition.

Although Laurentian is very cheap, trading at 0.45x P/B, I do not see any near-term catalysts to unlock shareholder value. I maintain my hold rating on Laurentian Bank's shares.

Paramount (PARA) (PARAA) talking with potential partners to merge streaming - CNBC, report of interest from media mogul Barry Diller/IAC. (00:29) U.S. judge halts Biden administration pause on LNG export licenses. (01:44) Conn's (CONN) may file for Chapter 11 bankruptcy - report. (02:46)

This is an abridged transcript of the podcast.

Paramount Global (NASDAQ:PARA) (NASDAQ:PARAA) is reportedly in discussions to merge Paramount+ with a partner -- and Warner Bros. Discovery (WBD) is again coming up as a potential match.

CNBC reported that Paramount is talking with other industry companies about such a venture, and along with WBD, those talks are said to have included Comcast (CMCSA), whose Peacock service is of a similar competitive scale to Paramount+.

A combination of Paramount+ with a service like WBD's Max and/or Peacock would give a firmer base with which to compete with the bigger players, in Netflix (NFLX) and Disney+/Hulu/ESPN (DIS).

Paramount (PARA) (PARAA) could also partner with a tech platform.

Along with stabilizing churn, a joint venture that included co-ownership would also take some streaming losses off the larger company balance sheet.

Meanwhile, Paramount Global (NASDAQ:PARA) has reportedly caught the eye of media mogul Barry Diller and his company IAC Inc. (IAC).

According to a New York Times report late Monday, which cited people familiar with the matter, Diller is exploring a bid to take control of Paramount.

The report says IAC (IAC) has signed a non-disclosure agreement with National Amusements, Paramount's controlling shareholder.

Premarket Paramount is up 3%.

A U.S. district judge on Monday blocked the Biden administration's ban on approving applications to export liquefied natural gas, ordering the LNG export ban ""be stayed in its entirety, effective immediately.""

A coalition of 16 Republican-led states, including Texas and Louisiana, filed suit in March, arguing the Biden administration lacked the authority to broadly deny the permits.

The administration said the pause was intended to allow the U.S. Department of Energy and other officials to review the process for analyzing economic and environmental impacts of projects seeking approval to export LNG.

The states said the pause on new approvals for LNG exports overstepped the DoE's authority under the Natural Gas Act, which they said must show projects are inconsistent with the public interest before denying applications.

The pause has raised uncertainty on the status of LNG export projects that have yet to obtain licenses.

Conn's (NASDAQ:CONN) may file for Chapter 11 bankruptcy in the coming weeks.

Sources told Bloomberg that the furniture retailer is buckling under years of losses and challenges in integrating rival W.S. Badcock which it acquired last year.

Conn's (CONN) is down 30% premarket after shedding nearly 6% on Monday. The shares have declined 77% YTD.

The plan to file for bankruptcy is not yet finalized and could change, the report noted.

Conn's (CONN) has struggled to rein in widening losses as customers cut back on discretionary spending amid high inflation.

The company engaged financial advisors to help with its debt and operations, and delayed filing its latest quarterly report with the SEC amid efforts to refinance its revolving credit facility.

Near the end of the dot-com bubble in 2000, my business partner and I stumbled onto the notion that the techs were acting much like a gold rush. Gold was being found in the dot-com world and creating riches, but its passion was producing ever more gold miners with golden dreams. Our company had traversed the dot-com craze during the late 1990s, chasing the gold like everyone else. But in early 2000, our valuation models simply could not justify the tech prices... not by a mile. A simple truth spoke to us: Never in the history of the US stock markets had an industry grown fast enough, long enough, to justify the prices of most tech and big consumer stocks. We decided to cut back on the hottest of the highflyers. It changed our company and our lives forever.

This seemingly bold move was not based on something we were convinced we knew, but just the opposite. It was because we knew we did not know how to value the techs, and that being the case, we decided to stand aside. Even then, there was nothing bold about our decision to start cutting back on techs. In fact, we visited every client we had and admitted to them we believed the techs had reached the gold rush state, but they might just keep going higher like they had over the last decade. The only thing we could say for sure was that our valuation models showed that many slower-growing companies were great values. We recommended placing sell orders 15% below the current prices on the six most overvalued tech stocks. Should any of these sell orders be triggered, we would invest the proceeds in undervalued dividend-paying stocks with dominant positions in their industries.

During the year 2000, all six of the stocks' sell orders were triggered, and we bought financials, consumer staples, and industrial companies whose prices had gone flat in recent years because their sales and earnings were growing in the high single digits, much less than the 25-50% annual earnings growth of the techs. Interestingly, these undervalued dividend-paying stocks actually rose in 2000 when the overall market fell by over 10% and the dot-com gold rush ended.

Why am I sharing this old tale? Am I predicting the AI gold rush is near its end? Indeed, are there other stocks that offer much better value with good prospects for future growth? No, I’m not. I am announcing, however, that the gold rush in AI is now a reality and there are two truisms about gold rushes of the past: 1) When everyone, everywhere knows that an industry or a particular stock is the center of the investing universe, there is a good chance that everyone owns the stocks and the new money needed to push the stock higher will soon be tapped out; 2) The analysis at the end of gold rushes has always revealed that the companies that sold the picks and shovels for the miners were the best place to put your money, not in the gold miners themselves.

As one who is old enough to remember the dot-com collapse, my reason for writing this blog is to just give everyone a heads-up that in my judgment, the AI phenomenon has officially reached the gold rush state. I said last time, my valuation models are showing that an S&P 500 level of 5700 is reasonable. If the AI world can produce overall sales and earning growth for corporate America of 11-12% over the next five years, the market is fairly priced. If earnings growth is higher than that, stocks still have a good run ahead of them. However, if the earnings growth falls back to a 7% or 8% handle, stocks will fall. Additionally, I do not see a long list of undervalued non-AI companies. Thus, I conclude the gold rush has room to run. I’ll keep you posted on what my models are saying as we go.

Investment Thesis

Diana Shipping (NYSE:DSX) is currently the cheapest bulker stock among its peers. While some discount is warranted due to management actions, the current 50% discount appears excessive. This discount is likely to decrease in the coming quarters as earnings improve due to charter rolls. Additionally, the 10% dividend is expected to be maintained over the next few quarters. If the discount is reduced to 25-30%, Diana Shipping will still be the cheapest dry bulk stock, but the stock price could rise to around $4, representing a potential 40% appreciation.

Business Overview

Diana Shipping specializes in the ownership and bareboat charter-in of dry bulk vessels, operating on a global scale. The company's fleet transports both major and minor bulk cargoes, with iron ore and coal representing 80% of their volume.

Founded in 1972 by Simeon Palios, Diana Shipping has grown from a small family business into an international bulker operator with around 40 ships. It has been listed on the New York Stock Exchange since 2005, making it one of the shipping stocks that have been trading on the NYSE for longer. Despite this, insider ownership remains above 50%.

Insider Ownership (Diana Shipping's 20-F)

The fleet consists of 40 dry bulk vessels: 4 Newcastlemax, 9 Capesize, 5 Post-Panamax, 6 Kamsarmax, 6 Panamax, and 9 Ultramax, with an average age of 10.8 years. One 2009 Capesize vessel has been sold with expected delivery by September 2024. Additionally, they have two methanol dual-fuel new-building Kamsarmax vessels scheduled for delivery in 2027 and 2028. I expect further fleet renewal, since they have an older 2007 Capesize vessel finishing its charter in January 2025, along with several other ships from 2010.

On their webpage, there is an extensive list of all vessel characteristics, their contract employment, and even a map of where each ship is located.

The main differentiation factor of Diana Shipping is that they don’t participate in the spot market. The company always charter out their fleet with contracts of around 1 to 2 years in duration. As of May, their average contract duration is 1.37 years, and only 34% of 2024 days were unfixed. This strategy allows management to have visibility, though it takes several quarters to benefit from strong rates. At the same time, it provides some protection when rates are declining.

This conservative approach reflects management's risk aversion, also evident in their financial decisions, such as the early refinancing of 2026 unsecured bonds.

On the other hand, management has engaged in some questionable actions, such as the spinoff of OceanPal, where they diluted shareholders using Maxim, resulting in a -99% return. At the Diana Shipping level, their actions have been more moderate; however, in December, they executed a highly dilutive warrants issuance without a financial need or a clear explanation. They issued 22 million warrants that can be converted into 33 million shares, potentially raising $88 million. This was likely done to continue paying the dividend in cash until earnings can sustain it.

Diana Shipping's Webpage

After reducing the dividend in Q4 2023, the current dividend is $0.075 per quarter, representing a 10% yield.

Diana Shipping's Q1 presentation

Last quarter's EPS was just $0.01 per share, and next quarter's EPS is expected to be only slightly better, with higher increases by year-end and 2025. However, given the strong market and the warrants issuance, I expect they will maintain the current dividend while continuing to roll the charters higher. If the market softens, the dividend could be at risk or they could pay in kind as they have done when earnings didn’t justify such a dividend.

Not all management actions are negative. Over several years, management executed buybacks through tender offers. I don’t expect any in the near future; however, if the market remains strong and all charters can be rolled up and debt reduced, I wouldn’t be surprised if they initiate a new one to try to compensate for the warrants issuance.

Finally, in November 2023, Diana Shipping entered into a joint venture agreement for the purpose of operating an offshore wind vessel company. The initial investment was €25 million, and in January 2024, it was increased to €50 million to allow the partnership to place orders for two additional CSOVs.

Dry bulk overview

The dry bulk market is currently experiencing unprecedented strength during what are typically softer months of the year.

Rates evolution (Diana Shipping's Q1 presentation)

This unseasonal strength can be attributed to a tight balance between supply and demand, along with specific factors such as low rainfall in Brazil and drought in Panama. However, some of this specific factors are starting to subside. If these factors disappear, rates could soften somewhat, but the underlying market remains well-balanced. Diana Shipping provides a slide highlighting both positives and negatives factors impacting this balance.

Diana Shipping's Q1 presentation

Regarding the orderbook, it has been steadily increasing and is approaching the 10% mark, which could potentially soften rates. However, this increase is still manageable and should not disproportionately impact market balance, especially with 9% of the fleet being 20 years or older.

Genco Shipping's Q1 presentation

Financial Position & Stock Valuation

Diana Shipping is in a comfortable financial position with secured revenue, $162 million in cash, and $628 million in debt at the end of Q1. Their debt profile is very manageable, having recently refinanced its 8.375% 2026 unsecured bonds for 8.75% 2029 bonds. This is further evidence of conservative management. Despite the higher rate, this move is positive because the older bonds were issued in a low-rate environment.

Debt amortization (Diana Shipping's Q1 presentation)

Utilizing Arctic Securities' asset values and Q1 company information, an estimation of the Q1 NAV can be derived. Valuing just the fleet on the water NAV stands at $6 per share. Counting all the warrants NAV gets reduced to $5.4 per share.

NAV Calculation (Diana Shipping's Q1 presentation & Author)

This indicates that Diana Shipping is currently trading at approximately 0.5 times NAV. Despite some questionable actions by management, this discount seems excessive considering the dividend yield, management's conservatism, and the expected improvement in earnings over the next few quarters.

In my previous article about a dry bulk company, I suggested that Safe Bulkers should trade around 0.8 times NAV. Considering my lower trust in Diana Shipping's management, I believe a NAV discount of around 25-30% would be fair, implying a valuation between $3.75 and $4, with approximately 40% upside potential.

Moreover, the current price presents an attractive entry point. The $2.8 area has served as important support over the last few months. While other dry bulk stocks are trading near their 52-week highs, Diana Shipping is close to its 52-week low. This discrepancy will likely correct once charter rollouts start contributing to Diana Shipping's results.

Another attractive aspect of the current prices is that, while I typically do not use stop-loss orders, this situation might warrant setting them just below recent lows.

Risks

The main risk would be a global recession. While the dry bulk market is currently balanced, a reduction in demand could lead to lower rates.

Another risk is the continued increase in the orderbook. However, if demand remains resilient and considering the age of the existing fleet, new orders would need to be substantial to derail this balance.

Finally, another significant risk is management's actions. Their dilutive actions, such as paying the dividend in shares or issuing warrants, have significantly increased the share count, weighing on the stock performance. Moreover, if the bulker market softens, the dividend may not be sustainable. If management decides to cut it, it will potentially cause a sharp decline in the stock price.

Conclusion

Diana Shipping is currently the cheapest dry bulk stock, and while some discount is deserved, trading at 50% of NAV it seems excessively high, especially with better quarters ahead.

Diana Shipping's chartering strategy makes it slower to benefit from stronger markets; however, these rate improvements are expected to materialize in the coming months. Meanwhile, they are paying a 10% annualized dividend, and if the market remains strong next year, they could even consider a tender offer that would be highly accretive.

Applying a 25/30% discount to NAV, Diana Shipping would still be the cheapest bulker stock, and will be trading around $4 per share, representing a 40% upside potential.","Founded in 1972 by Simeon Palios, Diana Shipping has grown from a small family business into an international bulker operator with around 40 ships.

Investment thesis

For transparency, let me start with this statement - I own a certain stake in Coca-Cola (NYSE:KO), I don't see a reason to sell it, and I consider adding more. Some investors may be concerned that Coca-Cola's valuation multiples are significantly higher than those of some of its competitors. However, I believe that the business is fairly valued with no reason to drop in value, but there is still some room for potential multiple appreciation.

Considering the:

leadership position with a top-tier, globally recognizable brand portfolio

improving market position through organic volume and organic growth (while outperforming the competition)

outstanding profitability exceeding 60% in terms of gross margin and 30% in terms of Operating Income and EBITDA margins

Dividend King status with dividends being well-covered and growing at an attractive pace

potential turnaround regarding the FX fluctuations given the upcoming shift in FED policy

I believe KO is an attractive opportunity for stability-seeking investors, especially those who are income-oriented. I am bullish on KO.

Quick Introduction

KO's Investor Presentation

KO is one of these stocks that doesn't require extensive introduction into its business. The products under its globally recognizable brands (including Fanta, Sprite, Schweppes, and, of course, Coca-Cola) are sold in over 200 markets. Apart from its soft drink brands, the Company is also engaged in the juice, water, coffee, tea, and ready-to-drink alcohol segments. KO's stock price has increased ~21.5% since its crash in the second half of 2023.

Data by YCharts

As an M&A advisor, I usually rely on a multiple valuation method, which is a leading tool in transaction processes. This method allows for accessible and market-driven benchmarking. Numerous metrics are available for valuing a company, with EV/EBITDA being a rule of thumb for most sectors, especially mature ones. However, it's crucial to understand the business metrics that can possibly impact a given multiple - only then may we know whether the market sentiment is reasonable.

With that said, the forward-looking EV/EBITDA multiple stood at:

~20.1x for KO

~14.8x for PepsiCo (PEP)

~13.6x for Keurig Dr Pepper (KDP)

Just by looking at these numbers, some could consider KO overvalued when compared to some of its peers, however, I don't believe that to be the case - here's why. Enjoy the read!

Coca-Cola's Valuation Is Justified

#1 KO further improves its leadership position

The Company distinguishes six business segments:

Europe, Middle East & Africa

Latin America

North America

Asia Pacific

Global Ventures

Bottling Investments

It managed to grow its sales within the most important segment (North America contributing to 37% of total sales) by ~7% in Q1 2024 compared to Q1 2023. KO didn't record sales growth within each of its business segments in Q1 2024; however, given their share in KO's total revenue, the Company delivered a 3% sales growth compared to the same period of the previous year. For details, please refer to the table below.

Own compilation based on KO's SEC filings

Looking at the big picture, the 3% sales growth was achieved through the (overall) positive effect of KO's pricing power, product & geography mix, which was partially offset by divestitures, negative foreign exchange fluctuations, and organic volume decline. For details, please refer to the chart below.

Own compilation based on KO's SEC filings

While there have been some unfavourable instances (e.g., a noticeable organic volume decline in the Europe, Middle East & Africa segment, as well as significant FX fluctuations from the above and the Latin America segments), I would like to bring your attention to the most important market for both KO and its competitors like PEP or KDP - North America. For details regarding the net sales growth recomposition by business segment, please refer to the table below.

Own compilation based on KO's SEC filings

As presented above, sales realised within the North American segment grew by ~7%, which was derived from the price, product, and geography mix. While reviewing KO's financial performance, I've been pleased to see a 0% change in organic volume. As no growth in terms of organic volume seems to be nothing to be happy about, let me clarify:

During 2023, organic volume for this segment declined by 1% compared to 2022, so Q1 2024 brought some improvement in this area Some of its competitors (PEP and KDP) found Q1 2024 more challenging in terms of organic volume as each of the above entities recorded volume declines within the comparable segments (PepsiCo Beverages North America for PEP and U.S. Refreshment Beverages for KDP)

For details, please review the charts below.

Own compilation based on KO's, PEP's, and KDP's SEC filings

Given the declining volumes of PEP (by 5%) and KDP (by 1.7%), we may presume, on the big picture level, that KO further improved the market position of its core business segment when compared to PEP and KDP by simply upholding its volumes. Also, with the highest net impact of other factors (7% vs 6% vs 6%), KO delivered the highest growth of the comparable business segment across the analyzed entities (7% vs 1% vs 4.3%).

Interestingly, when we unpack the 7% of price and mix of KO, we will find that the sole pricing effect of the Company was around 5%, as the Company's CEO, James Quincey explained during the Q1 2024 Earnings Call:

As it relates to pricing, of the seven points in the first quarter, approximately two of those are mix or timing related. The rest is pricing, and we expect that to moderate as the year goes on, and we expect the 2024 to be a much more normal year in terms of pricing.

#2 Outstanding profitability

Starting from the top and looking at the gross margin, Coca-Cola has generated significantly higher gross margins than PEP and KDP during the last three years. During Q1 2024, the Company marked a ~62.5% gross margin - once again noticeably higher than its competitors (54.8% for PEP and 55.9% for KDP). It's also an improvement of 1.8 percentage points to Q1 2023 when KO had a gross margin of 60.7%. The improvement was a result of the pricing power KO holds, which was partially offset by the increase in commodity prices, as well as unfavourable FX fluctuations.

Data by YCharts

Further, KO maintains a significant advantage over PEP and KDP in terms of Operating Income* and EBITDA* margins. Please note that I've included Net revenues, Cost of goods sold, and SG&A expenses in the Operating Income calculation, then adjusted for depreciation and authorisation costs to get EBITDA. As presented in the charts below, each entity improved its margins in 2023 vs. 2022 and Q1 2024 vs. Q1 2023. Similarly to the gross profit margin, KO significantly outperformed its competitors in terms of profitability measured at the Operating Income* and EBITDA* margins.

Own compilation based on KO's, PEP's, and KDP's SEC filings

#3 Dividend King

Coca-Cola is the Dividend King, with a reasonable and well-covered dividend yield of ~3%. This means that KO provided its shareholders with over 50 consecutive dividend increases (62 to be exact). That should be an especially attractive factor for income-oriented investors. KO's DPS marked a solid CAGR of 5.1% during the 2014 - 2023 period (with 2013 as a base year). The CAGR for the last five years (the 2019 - 2023 period) was lower and amounted to 3.4% due to the relatively modest dividend increases in 2019 and 2020. However, the DPS growth has picked up its pace in recent years, growing by 4.8% and 4.5% in 2022 and 2023, respectively (on a year-over-year basis). Moreover, assuming KO upholds its quarterly dividend through 2024, that would mean a 5.4% DPS growth year-over-year. For details regarding KO's DPS development during the 2013 - 2024 YTD period, please review the chart below.

Own compilation based on KO's website

The dividends remain well-covered as the Company has outstanding profitability and a strong balance sheet characterized by a below-target net debt to EBITDA of 1.6x (with the targeted range from 2.0x to 2.5x).

Risk Factors

The Company's industry is highly competitive and subject to a regulatory environment. As health awareness grows globally, some negative long-term trends accompany the market. The strengthening of such trends and KO's failure to adapt could endanger its long-term performance.

The inability to uphold and further grow its market share could worsen KO's financial performance. The Company's competitive edge lies in brand awareness, marketing efforts, and brand vision. Should consumers' perception of its key brands shift negatively, the Company's leading position could be endangered, leading to higher stock price volatility.

Any other material adverse changes could result in worse financial performance and higher stock price volatility.

Valuation Outlook & Key Takeaways

As indicated earlier, the forward-looking EV/EBITDA multiple stood at:

~20.1x for KO

~14.8x for PepsiCo

~13.6x for Keurig Dr Pepper

I don't see a reason why KO's multiple should be considered ""too high"", given the competitive advantages over its competitors. Considering the:

leadership position with a top-tier, globally recognizable brand portfolio

improving market position in terms of organic volume and organic growth

outstanding profitability

Dividend King status with dividends being well-covered and growing at an attractive pace

long track record of successfully navigating shifts in the ever-changing market environment, consumer behaviour, and business standards

potential turnaround regarding the FX fluctuations given the upcoming shift in FED policy

I remain bullish on KO. While I don't believe it will provide outstanding total returns, I consider the risk-to-reward ratio to be attractive. In terms of valuation, the EV/EBITDA multiple should remain within the 20.0x-21.0x range given the current state of the business.

Second Quarter 2024 Economic and Financial Review and Outlook

For the past two years, we have had a bifurcated economy, with a strong service sector and a weak manufacturing sector. Another unusual bifurcation is that while financial conditions are easy, borrowing conditions are tight. A third bifurcation is that while lower income and indebted individuals have been negatively impacted by rising interest rates, higher net worth individuals and savers have benefited from rising equity prices and rising rates on their savings. These bifurcations are creating a problem for the Federal Reserve and risks to the economy and markets - keeping rates higher for longer to reduce inflation negatively impacts the manufacturing sector, debtors and lower income individuals. We'll begin with a review of financial conditions versus borrowing conditions.

Financial conditions easy

While the Fed did raise the Fed Funds rate from 0%-0.25% to 5.25%-5.0%, financial conditions have turned easy based on the Fed's own definition of monetary policy conditions.

Financial Conditions Indexes (FCIs):

Summary of Multiple Indicators: FCIs combine data from various financial market sectors into a single score. This provides a more comprehensive picture compared to analyzing individual indicators.

Different FCIs, Different Weighting: There are several FCIs, each with its own methodology for weighting the component indicators. For instance, the Federal Reserve Bank of Chicago's National FCI considers over 100 factors, while the Fed's own FCI-G focuses on seven key variables.

Key Variables in FCIs:

Interest Rates: This includes the federal funds rate, long-term Treasury yields, mortgage rates, and corporate bond yields. Higher rates generally signal tighter financial conditions.

Stock Market Performance: Equity prices are factored in, with lower stock prices suggesting a less optimistic economic outlook.

Credit Spreads: The difference between yields on government bonds and riskier corporate bonds reflects creditworthiness and lending conditions in the market. Wider spreads indicate tighter financial conditions.

Exchange Rates: The value of the U.S. dollar relative to other currencies can influence import/export activity and overall economic performance.

Focus on Economic Impact:

The Fed's FCI-G (Financial Conditions Impulse on Growth) goes beyond just measuring current conditions. It incorporates a dynamic model to assess how changes in these financial variables are likely to affect future economic growth. By analyzing these measures, the Federal Reserve can determine if financial conditions are loose or tight, influencing economic activity and informing their monetary policy decisions.

What is the state of financial conditions?

The St. Louis Federal Reserve defines financial conditions as follows:

Measures of equity prices (also commonly referred to as stock prices), the strength of the U.S. dollar, market volatility, credit spreads, long-term interest rates, and other variables.

Financial conditions tend to be easy when investors are optimistic and speculative. Let's look at the five critical measures in the St. Louis Fed definition to understand why financial conditions are easy today.

Equity prices: The S&P 500 is up about 45% since the end of 2022 and about 15% through June. That supports consumer spending.

U.S. dollar: The dollar index has been relatively flat since 2023 and the year to date.

Market volatility: The VIX volatility index has been hovering between 12 and 15 this year. That is about one standard deviation below the average VIX reading of 19.32 over the last 35 years.

Credit spreads: The BBB investment-grade yield is only 1% above a comparable maturity Treasury. That is the tightest spread since the 1990s. Strong economy and strong earnings combined with very easy financial conditions are helping companies manage their balance sheets, including high debt levels as interest rate coverage ratios have begun to improve after declining sharply once the Fed began tightening in the second quarter of 2022.

Interest Coverage Ratio for Leveraged Loans (Apollo )

Long-term interest rates: Long-term interest rates have been significantly higher than average over the past few years and at levels last seen before the financial crisis in 2008. But they are about 1% lower than their peak last year.

Equity prices, market volatility, and credit spreads point to very easy financial conditions, and we might also characterize their levels as speculative.

The dollar has had little effect on financial conditions, as it has been relatively stable.

Another sign of easy financial conditions is that merger and acquisition activity has been increasing since December.

Investment Grade Bond Issuance (Apollo)

Financial conditions are easy in large part because robust sentiment in the equity and credit markets more than offsets higher interest rates. However, as Michael Lebowitz explained in his March 27, 2024, Advisor Perspective's article, rosy financial conditions belie the problems in borrowing conditions.

Borrowing Conditions

The Fed was reducing its balance sheet (quantitative tightening) by almost $100 billion a month. In a sign that the Fed is worried about the risk of unwanted market disruptions that could result from its balance sheet reductions (which tighten liquidity) - recall the"" Taper Tantrum"" of 2013. On May 1, 2024, it announced that starting on June 1 it will reduce the cap on Treasury securities it allows to mature and not be replaced from $65 billion to $25 billion per month. The Fed left the cap on how many mortgage-backed securities it will allow to roll off its books at $35 billion per month. That could keep upward pressure on mortgage rates. The Fed funds rate is at its highest level in over 15 years (5.25%-5.50%). 90-day commercial paper loans and yields on BBB-rated corporate bonds are at their highest levels since the financial crisis. Credit card interest rates are over 20%, about 5% above the highest in the past 24 years. Mortgage and auto-loan interest rates are up to levels not seen in at least 15 years, with auto loans ranging between 7% and 10%. Consumer-loan growth, excluding the pandemic, is down to levels last seen over 10 years ago. And credit card delinquency rates are at the highest levels since 2012 with almost 3.5% of card balances at least 30 days past due and the share of accounts making minimum payments are also at a series high.

Consumer Financial Stress (JPMorgan)

In addition, as another sign of stress, credit scores are falling.

Credit Scores Falling (Federal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia)

Lenders have responded to these deteriorating conditions by lowering the credit limit for new accounts, tightening standards, and raising rates.

Outstanding commercial and industrial (C&I) loans are declining.

As you have seen, there is a big difference between financial and borrowing conditions. Easy financial conditions and tight borrowing conditions make monetary policy difficult for the Fed to balance.

The Fed's dilemma

Financial conditions have eased considerably as investors priced out the odds of rate increases and still are pricing in rate cuts. The combination of lower interest rates and possibly less quantitative tightening, coupled with robust economic growth, has been the ""Goldilocks"" scenario driving investors' sentiment higher. This occurred despite tightening of borrowing conditions and high real interest rates.

Economy strength fueled by lower sensitivity to interest rates and huge fiscal deficits.

40% of homeowners don't have a mortgage, 92% of mortgages are fixed rate (not sensitive to the Fed raising interest rates), and most individuals and corporations took advantage of the low rates during Covid to refinance debt and lengthen maturity. A growing share of capex spending is intangibles (R&D and software), which generally is less sensitive to Fed hikes. The federal deficit is 6% of GDP at a time of full employment. The spending (including the CHIPS Act, Inflation Reduction Act, and Infrastructure Act) provides a strong tailwind to growth.

Federal Deficit as Percent of GDP (Federal Reserve Bank of Saint Louis)

Immigration has been strong, supporting overall employment growth. Higher interest rates give higher cash flow to households that own fixed-income assets.

Stronger than expected economic growth combined with inflation persistently running above the Fed's 2% target could create a predicament for the Fed.

Summary

The Goldilocks economy, coupled with the end of the rate hiking cycle, has investors optimistic, which eases financial conditions. Ironically, while some of the easiest financial conditions in the last 10 years have existed, borrowing conditions remain very tight. The Fed must balance these two conditions, which is difficult as they can counteract each other.

Since December 2023, households have said that it is easier to find a job, reflecting a rebound in corporate confidence - CEOs are becoming more bullish on the outlook for their businesses and the economy.

CEOs Confident (Apollo)

This suggests that companies have been able to adapt to the higher rate environment. The result could be that the ""r-star"" (the theoretical real neutral rate of interest that exists when the economy is at full employment and there are no inflationary or deflationary pressures) may be higher than the Fed currently thinks, increasing the risk that interest rates will stay higher for longer.

The economic picture continues to be one of two very different economies, with the manufacturing sector(11% of GDP) continuing to show weakness while the service sector, which is less sensitive to interest rates and is a much larger percentage of the economy (88%), remains strong.

Manufacturing Sector

U.S. factory activity unexpectedly expanded in March for the first time since September 2022 on a sharp rebound in production and stronger demand, while input costs climbed. The Institute for Supply Management's manufacturing gauge rose 2.5 points to 50.3 in March. It was the first increase in 17 months.

Manufacturing PMI (Institute for Supply Management)

Production snapped back sharply from a month earlier with a gain of 6.2 points that was the largest since mid-2020. At 54.6, output growth was the strongest since June 2022. At the same time, the cost of materials and other inputs is rising, suggesting stubborn inflationary pressures. The group's gauge of prices paid rose by 3.3 points to 55.8, the highest since July 2022. Unfortunately, the Manufacturing PMI® contracted to 49.2 in April and again to 48.7 percent in May. However, inflation remained stubborn with the prices index reading 60.9 in April and 57 in May.

Service Sector

The ISM Services PMI in the US soared to 53.8 in May 2024, the highest in nine months. This was on the heels of April's slight contraction, the first since December 2022.

Services PMI (Institute for Supply Management)

Commodity Prices

Further signs of both a robust economy and inflationary pressures is the significant rise in commodity prices we have experienced since the beginning of 2024. The S&P GSCI closed 2023 at 535.64. It ended the first quarter at 582.48, an increase of 8.7%. Prices softened slightly in the second quarter with the index closing at 578.39 (still a year-to-date increase of 7.8%). It's hard to see how the Fed could cut interest rates with increases like that.

The drivers of higher commodity prices have been: stronger than expected U.S. economic growth; geopolitical uncertainty; and strong AI demand for energy.

Labor Market

The labor market has rebounded since the Fed pivoted to more dovish stance in October 2023.

Jobs Plentiful (Apollo)

The US added 303,000 jobs in March and another 175,000 in April. And then another 272,000 in May. The strength of the labor market should give the Fed pause about moving rates lower. The strength of the labor market has led to rising labor costs. In the first quarter, the employment cost index, which measures wages and benefits, increased 1.2%, the most in a year, after rising 0.9% at the end of 2023. And average hourly wages increased 0.4% in May, pushing the annual increase to 4.1%. This could give the Fed pause about moving rates lower.

Employment Costs Sticky (US Bureau of Labor Statistics)

With that said, in a sign that the labor market is not as tight as it once was, job openings, a measure of labor demand, were down 325,000 to 8.49 million at the end March, the lowest level since February 2021. It fell further in April to 8.35 million. While layoffs remain low, the decline in openings points to a slower, but still positive, pace of hiring in the months ahead.

As a further sign of a cooling of the labor market is that new claims for unemployment have been rising. Adjusted initial unemployment claims was 242,000 during the week ending Saturday, June 8th, an increase of 13,000 from the previous week's unrevised level of 229,000. It fell slightly to 239,000 the following week, and then to 233,000.

Initial Claims for Unemployment (Department of Labor)

Consumer Sentiment Weakening

The long-term effects of higher inflation, combined with the cooling of the labor market has led to a drop in consumer sentiment. The University of Michigan sentiment index fell from 69.1 to 65.6 in June - a seven-month low. Note that the sentiment index is considered a leading economic indicator.

We turn now to looking at one of the biggest long-term risks to the economy.

Budget Deficits and Debt-to-GDP Unsustainable

The following charts show that the U.S. debt-to-GDP ratio is at a 150-year high (along with notably Japan). They also show the ratios for 17 other developed nations.

Developed Countries Debt-to-GDP ratios (QuantStreet, macrohistory.net)

The federal government now pays over$1 trillion in interest expenses annually. Before it spends a dime on the military, social welfare, or the tens of thousands of other expenditures, one-third of the government's tax revenue pays for the interest on the $34 trillion in debt, representing deficits of past years and decades. And it is getting worse as the federal budget deficit for the first six months of fiscal 2024, ending in March, was $ 1.064 trillion. Interest payments now make up 12% of federal spending, and it's about to get worse as the Treasury has to refinance maturing debt at much higher rates.

Interest Payments as Percent of Federal Expenditures (Apollo)

The problem is so bad that the CBO projects that by 2053 interest payments will make up 23% of total spending.

Projected Interest Payments as Percent of Federal Spending (Apollo)

The deficit problem isn't a shortage of tax revenue, which rose 7% from a year earlier to $2.19 trillion. Individual income-tax and payroll-tax revenue both rose 6%, while corporate income taxes rose 35%. As it has always been, the deficit is a spending problem.

The Congressional Budget Office warned in its latest projections that US federal government debt is on a path from 97% of GDP last year to 116% by 2034 - higher even than in World War II. And under current policies will eventually reach 200%.

Federal Debt Held by Public as % of GDP (Apollo)

The actual outlook is likely worse because from tax revenue to defense spending and interest rates, the CBO forecasts released earlier this year are underpinned by rosy assumptions (Trump tax cuts of 2017 expire in 2025 and CBO follows the legislation in its forecasts). Plug in the market's current view on interest rates, and the debt-to-GDP ratio rises to 123% in 2034. Then assume - as most in Washington do - that ex-President Donald Trump's tax cuts mainly stay in place, and the burden gets even higher.

With uncertainty about so many of the variables, Bloomberg Economics has run a million simulations to assess the fragility of the debt outlook. In 88% of the simulations, the results show the debt-to-GDP ratio is on an unsustainable path - defined as an increase over the next decade.

Successfully addressing the deficit is problematic given that Congress is bitterly divided on partisan lines. Republicans, who control the House, want deep spending cuts to bring down the ballooning deficit, without specifying exactly what they'd slash. Democrats, who oversee the Senate, argue that spending is less of a contributor to any deterioration in debt sustainability, with interest rates and tax revenues the key factors. Neither party favors squeezing the benefits provided by major entitlement programs.

Uncertainty of CBO Forecasts of Growing Debt Burden (Congressional Budget Office, Bloomberg Economics)

If something cannot go on forever, it will stop.

The problem of the deficit is compounded by much higher interest rates caused by the deficits themselves - the federal government now pays over$1 trillion in interest expenses annually. Before it spends a dime on the military, social welfare, or the tens of thousands of other expenditures, one-third of the government's tax revenue pays for the interest on the $34 trillion in debt, representing deficits of past years and decades. This creates a vicious circle. Add to that the problems of:

The need for a dramatic increase in infrastructure spending as the average age of highways, streets, and power facilities, U.S. infrastructure has never been in worse shape.

Aging of US Infrastructure (Apollo)

The actuarial status of the Old-Age and Survivors Insurance (OASI) and Disability Insurance (DI) Trust Funds shows that the projected reserve depletion date for the combined trust funds is 2034 - just 10 years away. Despite global geopolitical tension, we have been underspending on the military with defense as share of GDP at record low.

Defense Spending as Percent of GDP at Historic Low (Department of Defense)

The problem of the increasing debt burden has been made worse by the Fed's strategy of borrowing short-term to keep longer rates down, resulting in a record roughly $9 trillion in government debt maturing over the next year.

Record Amount of Treasury Debt Coming to Market in Next Year (Apollo)

The increasing deficits has caused Treasury issuance in 2024 to increase on average 35% across the yield curve.

Deficits Cause 35% Increase in Treasury Issuance (Apollo)

The ability of the markets to absorb all that debt could be challenged, especially when concerns over the combination of geopolitical issues and the growing fiscal deficits has resulted in the largest holders of Treasuries (foreigners) continuing to decrease their ownership of U.S. government bonds. For example, in the first quarter of 2024 China sold a record$53.3 billion of U.S. treasuries and agency debt, the largest sell-off initiated by China ever recorded. ""Even a close ally of the U.S., Belgium dumped $22 billion worth of treasuries during the same period.""

Sharp Decline in Foreign Holdings of Treasuries (Apollo)

Given these facts, interest rates could remain higher for longer than the market currently expects based on the current yield. That creates risks for both stock and bond markets. Higher rates for longer increases the risks for companies with low interest coverage, high financial leverage, and debt maturing in the nearer term. Combined with the risks in the commercial real estate market (specifically office loans), investors should not be surprised if the bond market were to experience a ""Minksy Moment"" - a sudden collapse of asset prices after a period of growth and stability - the kind Nassim Taleb (author of The Black Swan) has warned investors about.

We turn now to China.

China, the world's second-largest economy

Can China avoid a further slowdown in economic growth given the turmoil in its real-estate sector and high levels of local-government debt? And China's export sector has suffered since the pandemic because of weak demand from its major trading partners, along with increased sanctions and foreign companies deciding to diversify their supplier base. To turn the situation around, the government has focused efforts on reviving the manufacturing sector through exports of highly subsidized products such as inexpensive EVs and green energy products such as solar panels. The result has been a revival of the manufacturing sector with exports growing 7% in the first two months of the year. However, growth has since slowed, with May industrial production increasing 5.6% from year earlier.

Chinese efforts to restore 5% economic growth face several challenges: can Chinese tech firms remain competitive when the government continues to stifle entrepreneurship; the increase in the debt-to-GDP ratio (which more than doubled from 40% in 2014 to more than 80% in 2023) could start to constrain government spending; the overleveraged real estate market; and shrinking population (with the birth rate the lowest in decades). And China's housing slump deepened in May, dragging down industrial production.

China's Real Estate Slump Drags On Investment (National Bureau of Labor Statistics, Bloomberg)

China also faces the threat of retaliatory trade measures. While China's exports of subsidized products helps to reduce inflation pressures, they also threaten local jobs, and countries have begun to take retaliatory measures which not only threaten China's growth goals but create potential for trade wars which would negatively impact global growth as well as increasing inflation. Unless China shifts its historical focus on investment to stir growth to consumption (while the Chinese economy comprises just 21% of global GDP, consumption is just 15%), the risks of trade wars will increase.

Europe

Prospects for the 20-nation bloc have brightened after elevated inflation, rising interest rates and weak global demand sank output. After shrinking in the latter half of 2023, the first quarter's expansion came as Germany, France, Italy and Spain all produced positive growth, exceeding analyst expectations.

Eurozone Economy Watch (National Statistics Institutes)

The ECB expects a recovery as inflation continues to abate, household incomes rebound, and foreign demand strengthens, predicting growth of 0.6% in 2024 and 1.5% in 2025.

Geopolitical risks

Geopolitical risks are rising with the ongoing war in Ukraine, the Gaza situation, and tensions with China on its economic policy as well as military actions in the Far East could lead to trade wars with negative effects on economic growth and inflation (and even the potential for an invasion of Taiwan at some point - CIA Director William Burns stated that Chinese President Xi Jinping has instructed his country's army to be ""ready by 2027 to conduct a successful invasion"" of Taiwan, although he cautioned that it was not clear whether Xi had actually decided to use military force for unification. With this in mind, an invasion of Taiwan should no longer be considered a ""black swan"" event. While these risks have had only a limited effect on economies and markets so far, that can change overnight.

Consumer Spending

Consumer spending makes up about two-thirds of GDP. And consumption spending has been leading the economy.

Giving a boost to consumption spending, and thus the economy, are the baby boomers, by far the wealthiest generation. The baby boomers hold a record$76.2 trillion in wealth, or about half the total US household net worth of $156.2 trillion, and they are one group which has benefited from the rise in interest rates (because they are large net savers and are generally not impacted by rising mortgage rates). As economist Edward Yardeni noted: ""Seniors are traveling more, dining out more, and visiting their health care providers more."" In his April 13 Daily Spark, Torsten Slot noted: ""The significant rise in the stock market and significant cash flows from fixed income, US households have more money to travel on airplanes, stay at hotels, eat at restaurants, go to sporting events, amusement parks, and concerts, and that is why inflation in the non-housing service sector continues to be so high."" Supporting that view, as the chart below shows, a record number of respondents to the Conference Board's survey on consumer confidence are planning on a vacation to a foreign country in the next six months.

Foreign Travel Plans Rise Sharply (Apollo)

That increased spending is driving employment in these sectors higher, creating tight labor market conditions, making it more difficult for the Fed to bring inflation down. And with almost 50 million baby boomers who retired, their spending is less sensitive to the economy, and higher interest rates have boosted their income. Combine that with record stock prices, and strong residential real estate prices, it provides a good explanation for the strength of the economy. Barring an economic shock, their spending could provide a strong tailwind to the economy for years to come. With that said, retail purchases, unadjusted for inflation, did increase just 0.1% in May after a downwardly revised 0.2% drop in the prior month. However, excluding gasoline (the price of which had fallen), sales did rise 0.3%.

In addition, manufacturing is just beginning to show signs of breaking out of an almost two-year recession. Both industrial production and manufacturing output rose 0.9% in May.

Inflation

Inflation pressures continue to make it unlikely that the Fed will be able to cut interest rates as often as the market has been expecting, if at all. Inflation pressures are coming from the huge fiscal stimulus that continues despite good economic growth and unemployment levels remaining at levels consistent with ""full employment."" As John Cochrane, author of ""The Fiscal Theory of the Price Level"" explained in a recent post to his blog ""The Grumpy Economist"": ""If fiscal policy does not or cannot tighten, interest rates lose their power to lower inflation. If another bout of inflation comes, as the last one did, from fiscal policy, higher interest rates will just be gas on the fiscal fire. Central banks in fiscally constrained economies may turn out to be a lot less powerful than we think.""

Tight labor markets, combined with some states dramatically raising minimum wages (in particular, California), are contributing to upward pressure on inflation, as is stronger global growth and geopolitical concerns putting upward pressure on commodity prices.

Another problem for the Fed (and one they cannot impact) is that insurance costs are soaring, both for auto insurance (which is included in the CPI), and homeowners insurance (which is not included). If homeowner's insurance were factored into the U.S. Consumer Price Index, it could have added 80 basis points, or about 0.8%, to last year's CPI increase of 3.4%. Homeowners insurance costs rose 21% over the previous year. The increase is due to not only higher labor and material costs, but also more extreme fires, floods and storms. The U.S. endured a record 28 weather and climate disasters that caused at least $1 billion in damage last year.

Homeowner's Insurance Premiums Spiking (NAIC, Policygenius)

Another problem in the Fed's battle to drive inflation down is that U.S. housing inventories are extremely tight whether measured against the pace of sales or against the housing stock. One reason for the tight supply is federal, state, and local government extensive regulations on home construction, making it harder and more expensive to build. Other constraining factors include environmental rules, zoning limits, historical preservation, the promotion of ""smart growth"" or ""affordable housing.""

Historically, home prices usually declined only when months of inventory were above 6.0x; they are currently ~3.0x. While existing home sales have declined by ~30% from their pre-COVID pace, falling sales are not always accompanied by falling prices.

Housing Supply Tight (JPM ""Eye on the Market"" Q4,2023 )

The Fed and the markets did get some good news on the inflation front with the release of the May CPI and PPI figures. The Consumer Price Index for All Urban Consumers (CPI-U) was unchanged in May on a seasonally adjusted basis, after rising 0.3% in April. Over the last 12 months, the index increased 3.3%. The Producer Price Index declined 0.2% in May, seasonally adjusted, after increasing 0.5%, and falling 0.1%. The index advanced 2.2% over the last 12 months - close to the Fed's 2% target. However, to maintain credibility in its fight against inflation, the Fed will likely want to see at least a few more months of progress before cutting rates.

Election Risks

Whichever side of the political spectrum you are on, there are economic risks from the proposed policies of both candidates.

With a Trump victory there are the risks of an increase in tariffs (which risks retaliation) including the imposition of 60% tariff on Chinese goods (up from 20%-25% currently); the repeal of the corporate AMT and buyback tax combined, a large increase in defense spending, and full extension of TCJA tax cuts leading to even wider budget deficit. There is also the risk of militarized mass deportations negatively impacting labor force growth and wage inflation. Perhaps the greatest risk is that Trump has expressed the desire to influence Federal Reserve policy. Were this to happen, or even the threat of it happening, it could create significant downside risks.

The U.S. has long benefited from the dollar's role as the world's reserve currency. We have also benefited from our strong rule of law, our having the deepest and most liquid capital markets, and the freedom of capital. Any efforts to control the Fed could undermine the dollar and lead to an increase in the risk premium associated with U.S. debt instruments, raising the cost of our debt and negatively impacting our ability to fund the massive deficits we have accumulated.

With a Biden victory there are the risks of multitrillion dollar tax increases (half corporate, half high net worth) to support a multitrillion safety net expansion, widening the deficit as tax collections undershoot estimates while spending exceeds them.

The problem for the economy is that under either a Trump or a Biden presidency it is likely that the U.S. will continue to have a huge spending problem, with expenses running way above revenues. And eventually, lenders may no longer be willing to finance the deficits. If spending is not cut, the alternative solution would be to raise taxes to European levels. However, the result would European type growth rates, which have been much lower than ours. And that would have negative consequences for equities.

Investor Takeaways

Due to the lagged effects of monetary policy, and the fact that individuals and corporations took advantage of the financial suppression policy of the Fed and extended the duration of their liabilities (locking in low cost of debt), the positive effects of fiscal policy (for example, the CHIPS Act, the Inflation Reduction Act, and the Infrastructure Act) have dominated the negative effects of Fed hikes. However, while many economic indicators remain positive, there's concern over war, geopolitical tensions, and persistent inflationary pressures. In addition, while inflation does show some signs of cooling, a softer labor market along with the decline in consumer sentiment, increases the downside risk to consumer spending, and, thus, the economy.

Perhaps the most important takeaway is that the CBO's cost projections about future deficits contain valuable budgetary news, allowing financial advisors and investors to learn about the trajectory of the debt-to-GDP ratio. The takeaway should be that financial plans need to consider that there might be a negative impact on economic growth caused by rising debt, and that it could lead to lower equity returns in the future. Lower potential economic growth along with the risk of increased inflation, when combined with historically high valuations of U.S. stocks as represented by the S&P 500, should at least raise concerns. Prudent investors plan for these risks. For example, they adjust forecasts of future returns to reflect current valuations and yields (as opposed to relying on historical returns). They may also consider increasing allocations to fixed income assets that are less susceptible to inflation shocks (such as TIPS and floating rate debt), and rising discount rates on Treasuries. They may also consider increasing exposure to risk assets that are less correlated with economic growth and inflation risks.

Advisors and Investors should be prepared for volatility, especially if Congress is unable to avoid a shutdown of the government, trade tensions increase, geopolitical risks increase, or we have a financial accident. The surge in deficit spending at a time of overall growth in the economy is likely to shape a fierce debate on Capitol Hill about the nation's fiscal policies as lawmakers face a potential government shutdown early next year and choices over trillions of dollars in expiring tax cuts. As of June 30, 2024 the VIX(a measure of the market's volatility) was trading at 12.44, well below its historical average of about 20. (see chart below).

Volatility Index (macrotrends.net)

For those investors concerned about volatility and downside risk, there are two ways to address those issues. The first is to reduce exposure to stocks, longer-term bonds, and bonds with significant credit risks, while increasing their exposure to shorter-term, relatively safer credits. By raising interest rates dramatically, the Fed has made that alternative more attractive than it has been in years. For example, for those concerned about inflation, the yield on 5-year TIPS has increased from about -1.6% at the start of 2021 to about 2.1% on June 30, 2024.

Another way to address the risks, making the portfolio more resilient to ""Black Swan"" type events, is to diversify exposure to risk assets to include other unique sources of risk that have historically had low to no correlation with the economic cycle risk of stocks and/or the inflation risk of traditional bonds but have also provided risk premiums. The following are alternative assets that may provide diversification benefits. Alternative funds carry their own risks; therefore, investors should consult with their financial advisors about their own circumstances prior to making any adjustments to their portfolio.

Reinsurance: The asset class looks attractive, as losses in recent years have led to dramatic increases in premiums, and terms (such as increasing deductibles and tougher underwriting standards) have become more favorable. Those changes led to returns being well above historical averages in 2023. Investor can consider such funds SRRIX, SHRIX, and XILSX Private middle market lending (specifically senior, secured, sponsored, corporate debt): This asset class also looks attractive, as base lending rates have risen sharply, credit spreads have widened, lender terms have been enhanced (upfront fees have gone up), and credit standards have tightened (stronger covenants). Investors can consider such funds as CCLFX and CELFX.

Trend following (time-series momentum): It tends to perform best when needed most, during extended bear markets. Investors can consider funds such as QRMIX.

Cautionary warning

My 50 plus years of experience has taught me that one of the biggest and most common mistakes investors make is that they focus on forecasting the future (which is not only unknowable, but also likely filled with future unpredictable large drawdowns), instead of focusing on managing risks. That is why my reviews of the market and economy focus on risks, not specific forecasts. This tendency is a major failure for two reasons. First, investors are on average highly risk averse and because stock returns are not even close to being normally distributed with large losses occurring with much greater frequency than if the distribution of returns was normally distributed. The conclusion investors should draw is that their focus should be on minimizing the risks of large losses, making their portfolios more resilient to ""black swan"" events - or as Nassim Nicholas Taleb recommends, building portfolios that are ""antifragile."" In order to do that you need to include a significant allocation to assets whose risks are not highly correlated with the economic and geopolitical risks of equities.

Financial conditions easyWhile the Fed did raise the Fed Funds rate from 0%-0.25% to 5.25%-5.0%, financial conditions have turned easy based on the Fed's own definition of monetary policy conditions.
Financial Conditions Indexes (FCIs):Summary of Multiple Indicators: FCIs combine data from various financial market sectors into a single score.
However, as Michael Lebowitz explained in his March 27, 2024, Advisor Perspective's article, rosy financial conditions belie the problems in borrowing conditions.
Ironically, while some of the easiest financial conditions in the last 10 years have existed, borrowing conditions remain very tight.","['financial', 'quarter', 'growth', 'outlook', 'inflation',

Gannett investment thesis

For decades, newspaper companies like Gannett Co., Inc. (NYSE:GCI) have had to adapt to the new technologies that gave us the Internet, digitization, and more.

The company behind USA Today is getting closer to what it calls an inflection point, where new digital revenue that will offset and eventually surpass its print losses. The latest quarterly report indicates it is headed in the right direction.

But it is still displaying red ink and investors need to be patient. This is a company with promise, but we await proof it can make a profit and use those profits to drive new growth.

About Gannett

This now more than a century-old media company is also a creature of the digital age. In its 10-K for 2023, it calls itself a “diversified media company with expansive reach at the national and local level dedicated to empowering and enriching communities.” It operates through four major brands:

USA TODAY NETWORK, which comprises its national publication USA TODAY, as well as local media organizations in the U.S.

Newsquest: A wholly-owned subsidiary operating in the United Kingdom.

LocaliQ: A digital marketing solutions provider serving the small and medium-sized business sector.

USA TODAY NETWORK Ventures: This is its events division, which “creates impactful consumer engagements, promotions, and races.”

Reporting is done through three segments:

Domestic Gannett Media

Newsquest

Corporate and other: Includes functions such as legal, finance, and marketing.

Newsquest just emerged as a separate segment in the fourth quarter of 2023.

The company expanded significantly in 2019, when it merged with New Media Investment Group Inc. At the time, New Media was one of the country’s largest publishers of locally based print and online media. Its 152 daily papers and other assets bulked up Gannett’s presence domestically.

At the close of trading on June 28, its share price was $4.61 and its market cap was $641.21 million.

Digital and print competition

Gannett competes with thousands of other newspapers, online news sites, and more. Because Internet access is now cheap and easy, there are few barriers to entry in the news and digital information sphere.

Still, the firm has plenty of reach. It claims in the 10-K that is reaches half of U.S. adults through USA TODAY and local media brands. It also has the fourth largest digital audience in the News and Information category. Further, it points out, “our content reaches more people digitally than Fox News Media, CNN Network, CBS News, New York Times Digital, or WashingtonPost.com,”

Overall, its websites attract 187 million monthly unique visitors, which is almost 55% of the United States’ 2024 population of 342 million.

So, Gannett has at least scale as one of its competitive advantages, particularly over smaller and less integrated media firms. However, its margins are weak when compared with two other publishing giants, The New York Times Company (NYT) and News Corporation (NWSA):

GCI comparative margins table (author)

The net margin has been an Achilles Heel for Gannett over the past five years, stubbornly remaining negative:

Data by YCharts

The negative net margins suggest Gannett has a narrow moat, if it has one at all.

Management and strategy

CEO Mike Reed has been with the company since 2006. Originally, he had been the CEO of GateHouse Media, a subsidiary of New Media, which merged with Gannett in 2019. Previously, he had been President and CEO of Community Newspaper Holdings, and for multimedia company Park Communications.

CFO Doug Horne joined Gannett in 2020, and has more than a quarter century of experience in the entertainment, media, and technology industries. Previously, he held senior financial positions at The We Company and Warner Media.

Gannett’s strategy is to deliver long-term strategic value; in its presentation to the Citi Global Technology Conference in September 2023, it saw four tactics that would take it toward that goal:

GCI strategy and tactics slide (Citi investor presentation)

Within those four tactics, digital growth is the one that gets the most attention. As its print revenues fade, digital is the primary means by which it intends to grow profitably.

Stabilizing revenue trends means it is working to reach what it calls an inflection point, where the growth in digital revenues outpaces the loss of traditional revenues.

Adjusted EBITDA and free cash flow refer not only to profitability, but also making cash available for growth, whether organic or acquisitions. The firm does not pay a dividend.

Strengthening the balance sheet refers to repayment of debt taken on during the New Media-Gannett merger in 2019. Gannett is making good progress, reducing its outstanding principle from $1.76 billion in 2019 to $1.1 billion in Q1-2024.

Comments: senior managers appear to have the experience and expertise to continue leading the company toward that long-term shareholder value. On the individual tactics of the strategy, the firm has been making progress across the board. Most importantly, digital revenues are growing, and the company should hit its target of reaching the inflection point this year.

Financial reporting

Gannett released its first-quarter 2024 results on May 2, and the key points were:

Total revenue was $635.8 million, down 5% from the same period last year. It’s also better than the 8.4% decline in Q4-2023. Total digital revenues were up 8%, while its ‘same store’ revenues were down 5.1%.

It had a net loss of $84.8 million, including an impairment charge of $46 million due to exiting its leased facilities in McLean, Virginia.

Adjusted EBITDA fell 8.4% compared to Q1-2023.

Cash from operations hit $22.5 million, $15.7 million higher than the same period last year.

Free cash flow expanded to $9.5 million, an $11.5 million improvement on the same quarter last year.

At the close on March 31, it had cash and cash equivalents of $93.3 million.

Its total debt outstanding dropped to $1.114 billion after a repayment of $16.3 million.

In the Q1 earnings call, management sounded optimistic. As CEO Mike Reed put it, “As you will hear throughout the call this morning, our momentum continues to build, and we believe our first quarter results have set the tone for a promising 2024.”

He added, “Year-over-year revenue trends were a bright spot in the quarter, reflecting the most pronounced sequential trend improvement in nearly 3 years.”

Much of that optimism is based on digital revenues increasing; in Q1, digital provided 42% of total revenue, moving it closer to its 50% target. Management also was bullish on its print and commercial business, which is being optimized, “As a result of our efforts, our overall print trends saw sequential improvement in Q1, and we expect to continue this momentum moving forward.”

Growth

Management wrote in the 10-K, “Our strategy prioritizes maximizing the monetization of our audience through the growth of increasingly diverse and highly recurring digital businesses. We expect the execution of this strategy to enable us to continue our evolution to a predominantly digital media company.”

This 10-year chart shows the company slowly growing its EBITDA and net income, while its total revenues erode:

Data by YCharts

In its Q1-2024 investor presentation, it provided guidance for the rest of this year, 2025, and beyond. The outlook includes:

Revenue: for the full year, it expects total revenue growth to be nearly flat, while total digital revenues increase by 10%. In 2025 and subsequent years, it expects over 10% per year from digital.

Net income/loss: for this year, it is expected to improve, but will be negative because of a charge related to the closure of some of its offices. In 2025 and beyond, net income should be positive.

Adjusted EBITDA: continuing growth this year and in subsequent years.

Free cash flow: should be positive this year; for 2025 and beyond, it expects compounded annual growth of 40% per year.

The Wall Street analysts who have published estimates see profits coming in 2025:

GCI EPS estimates - Wall Street analysts (SeekingAlpha )

Comments: the estimates of the analysts are more cautious than those of the company. Both assume more momentum on the digital side of the business, and reduced costs from lower interest expenses. In addition, Gannett is enacting other cost controls that should help the bottom line.

And, the company has the trend to digitization as a tailwind, along with growing cash resources as EBITDA and free cash flow expand.

Valuation

Remarkably, for a company that hasn’t yet turned the corner to profitability, its share price has had quite a run over the past year:

GCI price chart (SeekingAlpha )

However, the charts are less attractive over five and ten years. A decade ago, shares were trading in the mid $20s.

The New York Times and News Corporation also have seen hard times over the past decade, but they recovered more quickly than Gannett:

Data by YCharts

Overall, the valuation metrics for Gannett are positive. Since its earnings are currently negative, the conventional P/E and PEG ratios are unavailable. But others are positive, as this excerpt from its Valuation page at Seeking Alpha shows (the second column shows the Gannett ratios, the third shows medians for the Communication Services sector, and the fourth shows the percentage differences between Gannett and the sector):

GCI valuations table (SeekingAlpha)

The Wall Street analysts have an average one-year price target of $4.53 (below the June 28 closing price of $4.69), a low estimate of $2.50 and a high estimate of $6.00. In the past, these analysts have been quite accurate in their forecasts:

GCI price target vs actual prices chart (SeekingAlpha)

The average target seems well grounded, and not simply because of the analysts’ record, especially over the past three years. In a year’s time, earnings should improve but may not have reached the inflection point or profitability. Gannett has indicated that could happen in 2024, but is not specific about which quarter.

Digital revenues are expected to be up 10% this year, but digital will still be less than half of the company’s total revenues. Until net income and earnings per share become positive, investors aren’t likely to join in this parade.

I agree with the analysts that $4.53 is a suitable target price for June 30, 2025, despite the runup in the share price in the past year. Therefore, I rate Gannett a Hold. The Quant system gives it a Hold as well, while Wall Street analysts give it Strong Buy, Hold, and Strong Sell ratings. There are no other Seeking Alpha ratings.

Despite my Hold, I expect the company to keep improving its top and bottom lines and become profitable. Once it does, I believe the share price will pick up as well.

Risk factors

Notwithstanding my long-term optimism, Gannett operates in highly competitive markets, especially in digital markets where technological advances can disrupt the status quo. Now, with a major expansion into the United Kingdom, management has to monitor international and domestic markets.

It points out in the 10-K that its business is highly sensitive to the markets in which it operates; advertising sales follow local economic conditions. In addition, demographics may change in those local markets, and it may not be able to respond appropriately.

Like most other companies, recruiting and keeping employees with the right skill sets is becoming increasingly difficult as the Baby Boomers retire. Also, from a human resources perspective, some of its employees are unionized, putting upward pressure on wages and exposing it to work stoppages.

Its 2027 debt notes include a conversion clause, and there is a possibility that shareholdings could be diluted if note holders decide to convert their notes into equity.

Artificial intelligence is upending many areas of the news industry, and may affect both its print and digital operations.

Conclusion

Gannett appears to be on the right track, as it grows its digital revenue to offset print losses. As it does so, it gets closer to producing black ink, rather than red, on the bottom line.

Prudent investors will want to see that inflection point and know the company is making good on its strategy and tactics. Until then, I rate it a Hold, with the promise of growth and profitability in the next year to two years.","As its print revenues fade, digital is the primary means by which it intends to grow profitably.
Stabilizing revenue trends means it is working to reach what it calls an inflection point, where the growth in digital revenues outpaces the loss of traditional revenues.
Total digital revenues were up 8%, while its ‘same store’ revenues were down 5.1%.
The outlook includes:Revenue: for the full year, it expects total revenue growth to be nearly flat, while total digital revenues increase by 10%.
Digital revenues are expected to be up 10% this year, but digital will still be less than half of the company’s total revenues.","['cash', 'revenues', 'gannett', 'growth', 'company', 'rise', 'print',

I wrote an article about Accenture plc (NYSE:ACN) back in November 2023 with a Hold rating. During this time, the company has returned -1.07% to its shareholders, compared to the S&P 500's 25.21% over the same period. Although it was up by 24% at one point, since February it has fallen by more than 25%. In today's article, I will summarize the events that have occurred, as well as update various thoughts and reflections I have had about the company.

Source: Koyfin

Underlying Thesis

As I explained in the first article, Accenture's underlying thesis is that they are the picks and shovels of any technological transition. Accenture benefits from any technological transition and innovation with minimal investment. They did so with the cloud and are now doing so with AI. They will also benefit from the next revolution.

Their global scale allows them to have incredible know-how, as well as make them more resilient and durable. This knowledge accumulates and creates synergies within the company, driving a sort of virtuous circle where the more clients they help, the greater the number of future problems they will be able to solve. This is because their solutions are stored in the company's internal data and can serve as a guide for future issues.

Accenture also has a global presence, both in terms of geographical location and client base. Their relationships with diamond clients (clients that spend more than $100 million annually with the company and have a relationship of over 5 years with them) protect them against any sector slowdowns. Many of these relationships are over 10 years old and include well-known companies such as Amazon, Salesforce, Adobe, etc. They have increased this number by 7 during the quarter.

Accenture's Total Addressable Market (TAM) indeed encompasses the 2,000 largest companies globally, including public, private, and nonprofit organizations. As a company grows, fewer consulting firms can effectively support its needs, which enhances the resilience of Accenture's clients and strengthens their long-term relationships. In fact, 75% of Fortune 500 companies do business with Accenture, and 95 out of its top 100 clients have been with the company for more than ten years.

Thanks to their scale, they are able to invest large sums of money that smaller competitors cannot, and these investments do not significantly impact their business figures. This is what I mean when I say they are able to ride any new technological wave without requiring significant investments. They are not the disruptors; they are the ones who help their clients implement new technologies.

Accenture Q3 2024 Earnings Call Transcript

On June 20th, Accenture reported its results for the third quarter of 2024. In this section, I will discuss the most important points mentioned in their conference call.

Accenture reaffirmed the thesis that they are the picks and shovels of technological transition during their presentation. However, they admitted that clients were becoming more hesitant to undertake more discretionary projects, which was also putting pressure on the prices they could charge. This is not a positive development and raises questions about how differentiated Accenture's services are compared to its competitors. However, these doubts were dispelled by management's comments regarding their market share compared to the competition:

""We continue to take market share on a rolling 4-quarter basis against our basket of our closest global publicly traded competitors, which is how we calculate market share"" Julie Sweet, Accenture's CEO.

""As a reminder, we assess market growth against our investable basket, which is roughly 2 dozen of our closest global public competitors, which represents about 1/3 of our addressable market."" KC McClure, Accenture's CFO.

However, if we look at their growth profile, we see that it has mostly come through acquisitions, with 35 so far this year. They say they do this to ultimately boost organic growth. The advantage of their scale and financial muscle is that they can make countercyclical investments, meaning they can buy interesting companies at the low points of the cycle when they tend to be cheaper. Acquisitions are also a way to acquire talent without having to develop it internally from scratch.

As we can see in the chart above, Accenture is currently in the trough of the current cycle. The consulting and outsourcing services they provide are cyclical, although they exhibit a clear underlying macro trend, distinguishing them from purely cyclical industries without such a trend. Below is a photo illustrating what I mean. Accenture's services may be postponed but not canceled, as this would risk their clients falling behind technologically compared to their competition.

However, if we look at their bookings, a clear leading indicator of their future sales, these increased by 22% in dollars and 26% in constant currency, with a book-to-bill ratio of 1.3, which explains the rise in their share price last Thursday. This could indicate the beginning of a new bullish cycle in the sector, following the challenging comparisons of the last two years after the surge in sales and profits experienced during the COVID-19 pandemic and the subsequent year.

They also discussed their capital allocation, mentioning that during the quarter they bought $1.4 billion worth of shares at an average price of $320.41. However, a significant portion of these buybacks will offset the dilutive effect of stock-based compensation (SBCs).

They made a comment about why their debt has increased: ""Yes. No, that's a great question. So, in terms of our cash, you said that we started the year at $9 billion, and now we're little bit - we are about $5.5 billion. And we do have some debt. It's very small, as you mentioned, for a company of our size. We do have a credit facility that we put in right during the pandemic, and we continue to have a credit facility. It's about $5.5 billion. It's a five-year credit facility and what you just see, Dave, is that we're just exercising some of that credit facility, kind of normal treasury operation."" KC McClure, Accenture's CFO.

They also discussed how their GenAI projects were progressing, for which they had a $3 billion investment plan.

""We also have leaned into the new area of growth, GenAI, which is comprised of smaller projects as our clients primarily are in experimentation mode, and this quarter we hit two important milestones. With over $900 million in new GenAI bookings this quarter, we now have $2 billion in GenAI sales year-to-date, and we have also achieved $500 million in revenue year-to-date. This compares to approximately $300 million in sales and roughly $100 million in revenue from GenAI in FY 2023. Leading in GenAI positions us to help our clients take the actions needed to reinvent and to benefit from GenAI, which frequently means large-scale transformations."" Julie Sweet, Accenture's CEO.

From here, we can calculate the ROIs they are achieving (over 50%), but only in terms of revenue since we don't know the margins they are generating. However, the company's operating margin has increased by 10 basis points compared to last year.

Finally, the management also provided the guidance for the fiscal year 2024:

""For the full fiscal 2024, we now expect our revenues to be in the range of 1.5% to 2.5% of growth in local currency over fiscal 2023, which assumes an inorganic contribution approaching 3%. We now expect our full year adjusted earnings per share for fiscal 2024 to be in the range of $11.85 to $12, or 2% to 3% growth over fiscal 2023 results. For the full fiscal 2024, we continue to expect operating cash flow to be in the range of $9.3 billion to $9.9 billion, property and equipment additions to be approximately $600 million, and free cash flow to be in the range of $8.7 billion to $9.3 billion,"" said KC McClure, Accenture's CFO.

Valuation

Once we know more about the company, it's time to start valuing it. Following the guidance on the company's free cash flow, we will adjust it for dilution in SBC to calculate Accenture's FCF yield for 2024. From there, I will try to determine what growth rate we can expect for this figure in the coming years.

For the Free Cash Flow of 2024, I have chosen the midpoint of the management's guidance (9B$). The stock options for 2023 were 1.9B$, and I believe they will increase by 12% in the future, which would give 2.1B$ in 2024. In recent years, this figure has grown at 15.75%, but I think that thanks to AI, they will be more efficient with the workforce, and it might even decrease in some segments of the company. I believe this will relieve pressure on them. Once we have the FCF Yield adjusted for SBCs and Accenture's current Enterprise Value, we can calculate its Yield (3.56%).

Source: Author's Representation

Now we need to calculate what we believe the company's FCF growth rate will be for the next 5 years. In recent years, this figure has grown at a CAGR of 11.62%. To do this, we will multiply the reinvestment rate (50%) by the ROIIC obtained over the last 6 years (20%). This gives us a growth rate of 10% for the FCF in the coming years. This is below past growth rates, but I believe it is a realistic scenario for the company.

Source: Author's Representation

Once we have this, we can think in two different ways. The first is that if the company is giving us an adjusted Yield of 3.56% and expects FCF growth of 10%, in the long term, it should give us mid to low double-digit returns. We can also perform a reverse DCF to see what growth rates the market is discounting at the current price and create other scenarios with different FCF growth rates. As I write this, Accenture is trading at $307. With a discount rate of 10% (the minimum I require for this type of investment) and a terminal growth rate of 3%, since I believe Accenture will always benefit from implementing future technological transitions, with the expected FCF growth of 10% projected over 10 years, we obtain a Fair Value of $299. With the same assumptions and changing the FCF growth rates, we can obtain other purchase prices, as shown in the image.

Source: Author's Representation

Taking into account everything discussed in this section, I believe Accenture is trading at Fair Value. To buy it and achieve somewhat higher IRRs, I would need some margin of safety. Therefore, I rate the stock as a hold and will watch it to buy at $240-250.

Risks

In my opinion, although some are a bit remote, Accenture's risks haven't changed much.

Its business model is very labor-intensive, making it less scalable and requiring high compensation in SBC. Additionally, it is a market with considerable competition for talent, so monitoring the attrition rate is essential.

It remains to be seen if artificial intelligence will benefit Accenture by making it more productive and less dependent on labor. On the other hand, it could also lead clients to use this technology to undertake projects they would have previously outsourced. However, given the complexity of these projects, I find this unlikely and think it might impact smaller consulting firms more.

A possible spin-off of the consulting division of the Big 4 auditing firms could flood the market with new competitors capable of working with clients they couldn't previously reach. This, in a market that already has few entry barriers, could suppose some risk for the firm. Although Accenture's scale and current clients can protect it from this.

Conclusion

In conclusion, Accenture remains a quality company trading at Fair Value. According to the bookings from the latest results, we might currently be in the trough of the cycle, which would imply a positive future evolution of the figures that the market has started to discount in the stock price. I will be waiting to add to the company in case it reaches my target prices. If it were trading around $250, I would have rated the stock as a buy. But we are not there yet. If any of the readers have worked for the company or its competitors, I would love to hear some insights about the company that are less known to the general public.","Accenture Q3 2024 Earnings Call TranscriptOn June 20th, Accenture reported its results for the third quarter of 2024.

Seeking Alpha,https://seekingalpha.com/article/4701993-porsche-stock-nice-6-percent-plus-yield-one-best-luxury-automobiles?source=feed_all_articles,2024-07-02,09:44:42 UTC,Porsche: A Nice 6%+ Yield From One Of The Best Luxury Automobiles (OTCMKTS:POAHY),"Brandon Woyshnis

Dear readers/followers,

Porsche (OTCPK:POAHY) didn't have a great 2023, and as things look right now, earnings in 2024 might drop as well. However, the company improved bottom-line margins and operating profit at an impressive level, and there's of course the elephant in the room that Porsche as a luxury brand, much like companies like Ferrari (RACE), will have some upside due to the demand for their high-level products.

Current challenges for Porsche do exist, and these are likely weighing on the bottom line, among these the company's investments in new models and BEV technology come at a price, impacting the bottom line. However, despite these issues, related to the cyclical environment and ownership structure, Porsche's brand image and global presence offer upside potential.

In this article, I mean to update why I invest capital in Porsche, and why I am happy holding the company even during a decline, potentially even adding more.

As an investor, my clear focus lies in investing in quality companies at cheap prices. I have been covering, this week, a number of French companies that I believe offer incredible upside for the price at which they currently trade. In this article, which is a followup to the article you can find here, it's time to look at a German ""giant"".

Let's see what we have here.

Porsche - Plenty of Upside, if the company turns around

I haven't often covered Porsche over the past few years. This has to do with my overall stance on investments like this. Porsche, like Volkswagen (OTCPK:VWAGY) is more of an income investment to me than it is a value investment with a capital appreciation upside. There is some of that in there, but for the most part, I'm looking for yield coupled with that upside - and I'm mostly getting it as well.

Porsche reported fairly negative results for 2023 and year-end. The company's earnings came in below consensus estimates (Source: S&P Global), by over 10%, as I covered in my previous piece. Looking at the latest sort of results we have here.

We have 1Q24 results presented during late April, and 2Q24 fairly close - so we'll see what we can deduce from these. For 1Q24, company highlights include a new successful presentation launch of the EV versions of both the Taycan and Macan models - but overall group performance was hampered by some issues with availability, which resulted in poor fixed cost coverage.

However, none of this negativity translated into guidance, where the company still believes in a very strong order book, and improved availability of new models providing a very solid foundation for sequentially improved unit sales, revenues and rising profitability for the remainder of the year.

As we can see in the company results, we have a slightly lower EBITDA margin, and overall lower numbers compared to the former year - which also explains the double-digit drop in share price that we've seen since the publication of this piece. Since my last article, the company is, in fact, down 12%, which is noteworthy for Porsche or any company like this. Given these results, however, I can see why analysts and the market overall might be a bit concerned, as a 400 bps RoS is not small, and a double-digit revenue decline for a company like this needs to be qualified - not to mention a 30%+ decline in EBIT.

However, most of the company's fundamentals are intact at a level that would give me very little worry here. We're talking significant net liquidity - over €7.2B, which enables Porsche to do more or less what it ""wants"", as well as a continuing push into R&D of over €1B and another €400M in CapEx.

The real issue during the quarter was vehicle availability. The company, other than this, provided very good strategic execution of its objectives and saw financial service operating profit at 6.3%. One other part that I'm very favorable about is that Porsche continues to push value over volume, among other things in China.

Unlike some other companies, Porsche is still seeing disproportionately high material costs, elevated R&D, elevated D&A, and launch costs, but this has to do with the introduction of new vehicles, which has been frequent for the company during this year.

The lack of availability has also impacted both automotive sales and automotive deliveries.

Porsche IR (Porsche IR)

One interesting and noteworthy trend here is the company's BEV share of sales. I have made no secret of the fact that I do not particularly believe in the impending ""domination"" of BEV of the market. At best, I believe will be an acceptable solution for people in urban environments that travel sub-20 mile distances or so, with higher distances correlating to higher amounts of ICE-powered vehicles. Of course, I'm not blind to the fact that this unimpressive BEV number for Porsche, in particular, has a lot to do with the changeover of the Taycan as well as restrictions - but I believe there to be an amount in that figure as well that has to do with that people aren't as convinced by BEV's as some would like to believe.

Speaking only for myself and anecdotally, I would never buy a BEV - and would rather buy a used 3-4-year-old ICE vehicle with low miles if and when I need a new car next to my own.

Here's the company's current delivery mix.

Porsche IR (Porsche IR)

Not much negative here, and the company's order ""bank"" remains attractively high, confirming the company's status as a desirable sort of manufacturer here.

Still, the company, despite the confirmation, has a number of risks that we should at the very least be aware of prior to investment.

Upside and Risk to Porsche

The obvious risks to the company are related to the cyclical and capital-intensive environment where the company operates - as you can see in the quarterly results in how things are going for margins. Any production of inventory overcapacity or excess here is negative for the business, turning profits down - again, as you see in this quarter.

Aside from this, there aren't many major risks that are operational, more ""structural"", as I would call them - such as the Porsche/Piesch family. Without exaggerating, this is essentially a family investment vehicle, and you will never have a say in Porsche.

These owners can easily block major decisions for the company, which means that even if the company has capable management, they're not really in charge, they're more like Stewarts controlled by the family (if they do something the family does not agree with).

Thirdly, and last, I would say that like with BMW (OTCPK:BMWYY), the company's risks are union-related. Porsche's workforce is very heavily unionized - not only do they have heavy representation, but the union has board representation (again, just like BMW), which tends to limit profit because of lock-step wage demands during times that are good and claims to benefits during worse times, combined with work rules and pushing that limit company flexibility.

I continue to believe that the upside outweighs any downside here. Between Porsche's aforementioned premium/luxury brand image, its presence in a global market which reduces its demand on any one regional economy and improves overall growth prospects (just look at the mix on a geographic basis), along the fact that the products command incredible ownership loyalty due to their build quality means that Porsche owners are likely to remain Porsche owners.

It's a very attractive product to own, and I would be lying if I said I hadn't ever considered a Porsche for the brand appeal (though not right now).

This in turn brings us to valuation.

Valuation for Porsche - The company has a double-digit upside

I invest in the PAH3 ticker. This is the preferred stock, and it yields 6%+ compared to the 4% of the other ticker. You also get quite a bit of capital appreciation here that is somewhat atypical of a pref stock.

F.A.S.T graphs Porsche valuation (F.A.S.T graphs Porsche valuation)

The company typically warrants a high P/E, and it's currently trading below this. The native price for the PAH3 ticker is now €43/share, and despite analyst targets having moderated from around €75/share average a year ago to around €60/share, this still implies a 43% upside at this price of €42.21/share. (Source: Paywalled TIKR.com Link).

This is from a total of 10 analysts with a low of €45/share to a high of €100/share - so there's plenty of upside even if you only believe the company is worth the absolutely lowest sort of price here. 5 analysts are at ""BUY"" or equivalent - and I would understand why given the company's very recent downturn.

Remember, and as you can see above, PAH3 has dropped from over €100/share to less than €50/share in around 4 years.

While risks do exist for Porsche, as mentioned above, I view the near-term risks to this company as fairly limited - especially now given the price/valuation - due to the combination of brand strength and stability in production, margin, and sales.

Diversification of these sales on a global scale is also a major advantage here.

Evaluating or valuing Porsche is quite tricky. A DCF based on a discount of 8-9% with a growth rate in perpetuity of below 7% implies a fair value going up above €200/share. We could even bring this down by 50% and still see an over 50% upside. Even if you say, look at peers, such as Ferrari, Honda, Benz, or other automobiles with premium potential, a similar multiple in terms of Revenues would imply a share price or fair value of around €180 - yet again a massive upside. Any KPI you choose to look at here implies a massive upside to this company.

I choose to stay conservative. My previous PT was €75/share, discounting any implied FV by 50-75%.

I maintain this PT here and give you the following thesis for Porsche.

Thesis

Porsche is, to me, a more interesting investment than VW due to its corporate structure and holdings. With the recent information on the IPO and the dividend bump, as well as improved results, the company's portfolio is ready for improvement and higher returns. However, the company is also ""less"" interesting than VW, because of a currently inferior yield, by which I mean a quite inferior yield indeed, Porsche only manages just above 1% in yield for the preferred share, which is significantly below that of VW.

These changes justify a change in the price target, and I now consider Porsche to be a ""BUY"" with an upside to a PT of €75/share.

I am still LONG Porsche and will watch results and valuation with interest here, and I may expand my position at a continued undervaluation as of July of 2024.

Remember, I'm all about:

Buying undervalued - even if that undervaluation is slight and not mind-numbingly massive - companies at a discount, allowing them to normalize over time and harvesting capital gains and dividends in the meantime. If the company goes well beyond normalization and goes into overvaluation, I harvest gains and rotate my position into other undervalued stocks, repeating #1. If the company doesn't go into overvaluation but hovers within a fair value, or goes back down to undervaluation, I buy more as time allows. I reinvest proceeds from dividends, savings from work, or other cash inflows as specified in #1.

Here are my criteria and how the company fulfills them (italicized).

This company is overall qualitative.

This company is fundamentally safe/conservative & well-run.

This company pays a well-covered dividend.

This company is currently cheap.

This company has a realistic upside that is high enough, based on earnings growth or multiple expansion/reversion.

Porsche now fulfills all of my investment criteria - it's a ""BUY"" here.

Seeking Alpha,https://seekingalpha.com/article/4701991-keurig-dr-pepper-selling-calls-can-yield-7-percent-with-room-for-upside?source=feed_all_articles,2024-07-02,09:29:22 UTC,Keurig Dr Pepper: Selling Calls Can Yield 7% With Room For Upside (NASDAQ:KDP),"typhoonski

Something momentous happened recently in the soda world that you may have missed: Dr Pepper passed Pepsi as the second favorite soda brand in the United States.

This comes following decades of dominance by the two large industry incumbents, Coke (KO) and Pepsi (PEP):

WSJ, FlowingData, Beverage Digest

While many have been quick to call this a 'TikTok marketing win', the underlying trends supporting Dr Pepper's rise have long been brewing. As you can see above, Dr Pepper - which is owned by Keurig Dr Pepper (NASDAQ:KDP) - has steadily been gaining market share since the mid-2000's, largely on the back of a wider distribution strategy and investments into the Dr Pepper brand.

While this Pepsi inflection is an interesting data point, it's emblematic of a broader trend: the rise of KDP as a whole. Since the merger in 2018, the company has grown revenues significantly and more than doubled net income, and the outlook remains positive. KDP's popular refreshing beverage and coffee products stand to grow EPS steadily into the future, and we believe strongly in the value creation potential of the company's 45+ brands.

In addition to the potential upside, the company's stable results are mirrored in the stock's low-volatility profile. Today, trading at an attractive valuation, shares in KDP appear well suited to a covered-call play - buying shares in the underlying stock while selling call options out of the money. If all works out, this low-risk trade promises to yield an impressive 8% while leaving some room for capital appreciation as KDP's EPS continues to move northward.

If you're focused on value, income, or quality in your investing, this could be a great play to consider. Let's dive in and explore it all a bit more.

KDP's Financials

As always, let's start with the financials.

Overall, KDP runs a relatively tight ship, with meets or beats on the top and bottom line for the most part over the last several years:

Seeking Alpha

While there have been some misses, the picture here is one of a company that typically comes in a bit ahead of 'market' estimates. Nominally, the company has also done well, although net income generation has been a bit choppy:

TradingView

Despite the bumps, over the last 5 years, KDP has managed to grow sales by nearly 50%, and boost net income by more than double. This is highly impressive in an otherwise complicated period for consumer staples companies.

This growth comes largely on the back of optimizations around the company's core brands, from both a demand (marketing) perspective, as well as an execution (supply) standpoint. More demand for more of the products that customers really want, optimized into the right packaging, in the right places, at the right times.

TTM top line sales have slowed somewhat as of late, but this is largely due to a combination of moderating inflation, as well as a bit of coffee cyclicality that can be seen industry wide.

You may notice above that KDP's FCF has dipped substantially between 2022 and now, from highs of more than TTM $2 billion to under TTM $1 billion. In our view, this is likely what has driven a sustained drawdown in the stock over that period:

TradingView

The good news is that this is largely due to supplier financing and other payables issues that management thinks will work through the system in the second half of this year.

Plus, gross margins are still strong and stable, and there hasn't really been a material change in company liquidity over time. In our view, these FCF results are not the canary in the coal mine for a larger issue.

Looking forward, analysts predict that EPS will continue to grow roughly 7.2% YoY into the future, which feels about right to us:

FAST Graphs

It's also in line with what management has been projecting:

We continue to expect mid-single-digit net sales and high single-digit EPS growth in 2024, both consistent with our long-term financial algorithm. Our plans continue to embed strong top line momentum in our U.S. refreshment beverages and International segments with a relatively muted growth contribution from U.S. coffee. We expect productivity savings to help offset a more normal level of inflation. We also plan to continue to deploy investment dollars behind brands and capabilities to support our top line growth. The incremental flexibility afforded to us by our Q1 outperformance should enable us to balance these concentrations. As a result, we continue to anticipate healthy operating profit growth and full year operating margin expansion on a consolidated basis.

All in all, KDP appears to be a solid, well-run company focused on steady growth, brand expansion, and shareholder returns.

The Opportunity

In our eyes, the opportunity with KDP here is twofold.

First off, the valuation appears attractive, which supports a 'long' entry into the stock.

Some may see the stock as expensive on a nominal basis for a consumer staples stock, but in the soda category, it's actually cheaper than peers KO and PEP:

Seeking Alpha

Additionally, on a historical basis, KDP is trading in the lower band of the standard deviation of the last 5 years' multiple, when it comes to both the top and bottom line:

TradingView

At 3x sales and 21x GAAP P/E, it's not the cheapest stock on planet earth, but it's also not as expensive as a large swath of the mega cap market these days.

Secondly, KDP's stock also exhibits an extraordinarily low level of realized volatility, which is somewhat unique in an otherwise hectic market.

For the last several years, KDP's stock has traded between $30 and $39, which is a rather stable, predictable range:

TradingView

Additionally, the stock has a beta of 0.23, which means that overall, shares of KDP are not highly sensitive to market moves, which gives us - as traders - our own little volatility playground where we can construct a winning trade.

While option premiums are linked with instrument volatility, KDP's ATR is very, very low, which, when combined with the valuation, makes it ideal for the aforementioned covered call trade we'll take a look at now.

The Trade

So - KDP is a healthy, stable, growing company, trading at a decent valuation, with a low-volatility profile. What is the best way to make money on this stock?

In our view, buying shares of KDP and then selling OTM calls is the best bang-for-your-buck opportunity around.

The first step is simple - buy 100 shares of KDP. At ~$33 per share, this should cost you about $3,300 in total capital.

Then, sell the $35 strike, June 20, 2025, options for $2.20 per share, or $220 per contract:

TradingView

As you can see in the chart above, the trade results in a cost basis in KDP of 30.69, which is a roughly 6.5% discount in the stock.

Similarly, as this is your cost basis, $220 per contract in cash, divided by $3,069 per contract collateral, is a return of roughly 7%, over the next year or so.

Finally, the $35 strike contracts allow for 6.5% upside in the share price until potential assignment.

This means that when you buy KDP and sell the recommended calls, one of three things can happen -

KDP goes up over the next year, and you make 6.5% in capital appreciation in addition to the 7% cash yield you get from selling the calls. Plus, you get the 2.5% dividend. That's 16% over the next year in total. KDP trades sideways over the next year. In this case, you get to keep the 7%, plus the dividend, for a 9.5% total return in a low vol stock. You can then sell calls again to juice the yield further. Finally, KDP could go down over the next year, below $30.69. In that case, you'd own the stock from a better-than-market price, plus you'd still have the opportunity to sell more calls on the stock going forward.

To us, KDP seems rather stable but, ultimately, probably doesn't have explosive upside in terms of capital appreciation. Thus, we think that a covered call trade like the one above is highly attractive. It trades some of this potential into cold hard cash in our accounts.

Ultimately, we'd be happy with any of the three outcomes listed above.

Risks

There are upsides, but there are some risks when it comes to engaging in a covered call trade as well.

For example, KDP could go down in value materially, such that selling another covered call wouldn't produce much in the way of yield. This is why we're happy with holding the stock given the stability and value anyway, but it's good to be aware of if you're going in expecting to attempt a long-term option selling campaign on the stock.

Additionally, selling calls comes with opportunity risk if KDP does quite well. Capital appreciation with this covered call trade is limited to 6.5%, and anything more than that is null and void, assuming you don't adjust the trade, which we wouldn't recommend. It's a sacrifice, but it makes sense, in our view.

Finally, KDP, to us, doesn't appear to be an expensive stock, but there's always a chance that operational fumbles could cause the multiple to contract following a string of poor results. Given that this trade has a timeline of a year, to some degree, you can be 'locked in' unless you want to exit early, which can be more expensive given the higher transaction fees associated with closing option trades.

Summary

That said, despite the risks, we'd be happy with any of the outcomes mentioned above.

Whether KDP goes up, down, or sideways, selling premium on this stable, profitable, low-vol company seems to be a win-win, no matter how you look at it.

Thus, our 'Buy' rating.

The First Trust Morningstar Dividend Leaders Index Fund (NYSEARCA:FDL) is one I have followed for the majority of its 18-year history. Back in the early to middle stage of my investment advisory career, Morningstar was the place to go for mutual fund analysis and later, ETF analysis. They also provide credible stock research. It is easy to use, written in fairly plain language, and inexpensive to access. At one point in my career, I think I used nearly every advisor-focused product Morningstar offered, from the $199 version to the $35,000 annual subscription for the full-fledged research system. But those days are gone.

Morningstar ratings still deceive many newer investors into thinking that an ETF is ""good"" for them when, in reality, most of the firm's retail-facing product line has become the butt of many investment professionals' jokes. That's because about a decade ago, at their annual conference that I happened to attend with my then college-aged son (combined with a home game for both the Cubs and White Sox, of course), the then-CEO made a presentation that was a clear shift from human research to simply crunching numbers, and using the firm's deserved reputation and brand as a rating service.

But I realized back then, the Morningstar I knew and admired, now a thriving public company and far from founder Joe Mansueto's initial research-driven focus, was history. Frankly, the closest thing I see to that ""vintage"" Morningstar is Seeking Alpha. As such, when I see Morningstar as an index provider, it doesn't mean to me what it used to.

FDL: well constructed for what it is, but passive dividend stock indexing now has some big issues for me

That is one issue with FDL, which I have owned on and off several times over the years. The other has little to do with Morningstar, but rather with the class of dividend stocks known as ""aristocrats."" FDL does not specifically refer to this 100-stock index ETF by that name, but the direction is the same. Here's a summary of how First Trust, the ETF's owner, describes the Morningstar Dividend Leaders Index that is the basis for this fund. It looks for stocks that:

Have historically maintained consistent and sustainable dividend policies.

Based on forward-looking earnings estimates and indicated dividends, stocks are eliminated from consideration if: The five-year indicated dividend per share growth is less than zero One year estimated earnings per share divided by its indicated dividend per share is less than or equal to one.



FDL then takes the stocks it filters down to, and those are ranked by indicated dividend yield. The top 100 are selected for inclusion in the index, and no stock can exceed 10% of the ETF assets as of each quarterly rebalance date. The screening process repeats again once a year.

That produces a portfolio that currently looks like this:

Seeking Alpha

Frankly, I should like this ETF more than I do. It is concentrated at the top, with 10 stocks accounting for 55% of assets. I like that because I don't really want to ""overkill"" an ETF position by owning 100 stocks. And I actually own several of the top holdings from FDL in my own 40-stock YARP (Yield at Reasonable Price) portfolio that I've written about, including this one from May 28.

With a yield of nearly 4.5%, FDL is really a nice combination of quality and yield. So, what is my beef with this ETF?

Ycharts

I don't trust the aristocrat approach going forward - Here's why

I think that too much has been made about past dividend consistency. For an investor who is determined to buy and hold a set of dividend stocks for 5-10 years or longer, I can see why they would want to strongly consider FDL. However, my main concern is that too much praise has been heaped on dividend stocks solely on the basis of the ability to sustain that dividend.

To be clear, I prioritize dividend stability and persistent payment and growth of the dividend. It is not the ""aristocrats"" I have an issue with per se. It is the stock market, particularly for dividend stocks.

I created my own retirement stock portfolio so that 2 things wouldn't burn me:

1. Steep drops in the market, not due to the stocks I owned suddenly becoming lousy businesses, but because modern market forces and emotions, and the overzealous charge into index funds has made the broad market so much more cyclical and vulnerable than in the past.

It might be subtle to see, but the right side of this chart shows that FDL has been more volatile the past 5 year than the prior 5 years. I think that type of topsy-turvy price action for yield stocks now comes with the territory. In large part, that is simply because they are not tech ""darlings"" and thus get no benefit of the doubt, ever. 2024 has been a year where big tech companies are assumed to be bulletproof, yet stocks in sectors like healthcare, financials, consumer staples and energy, which combine for about 65% of FDL's assets, are seemingly one piece of bad news from being sold off sharply.

Data by YCharts

When that happens to a growth stock, I can accept that as an investor. When it happens to a dividend stock, it costs me quarters or years of precious dividend income. Sure, I'll get the income in cash, but my total return could take a while to recover. And as we've seen in the past, sometimes that recovery can be years in the making. That's not in the range of what I am willing to accept as a dividend investor. And thus, while I like a lot of the individual parts of FDL and the overall methodology to do the screening, the buy and hold aspect of this and other dividend ETFs is something I consider to be outdated.

2. So, the second aspect of my stock by stock dividend approach for myself in semi-retirement is to do half of what FDL does (select a set of stocks via a regimented process)...BUT...rotate the position sizes more frequently. That is, I don't just buy a position in a stock and let it sit there. I will continue to hold it at a 1% minimum position, and a maximum 5% position. What influences that position size over time depends on when the dividend ex-date and earnings are occurring, the price pattern of the stock, and of course, the underlying valuation and fundamental picture. And, market sentiment, which has too much influence on nearly all non-Magnificent 7 stocks to ignore.

Below is the part I am concerned too many investors do not give enough credit to, in terms of its potential harm to their hard-earned wealth. This charts FDL's largest drop from top to bottom (including dividends) over every 12-month time frame.

Data by YCharts

Sure, it has been a few years since we had a doozy like 2020 or 2008, but FDL routinely falls 10% to 12% in a year's time. And remember, this is an index of 100 stocks, and even 10 of them only covers about half the assets. So at the individual stock level, I take no comfort in knowing that these stocks will continue to pay their dividends. Getting a 4.5% dividend but losing 15% or 25% or even 45% in principal in a year is not a hole I plan to ever need to climb out of.

This is not part of my retirement plan!

I am risk-management first, which means I want to grab as much dividend income as I can, but not at any cost in terms of price declines. Otherwise, it opens the door for a scenario like what we saw from September 2007-September 2012. 5 years, 3.3% total return, just sliding past 1-3 month T-bills.

Data by YCharts

So, I don't think the current market climate supports a buy and hold dividend stock approach. While FDL in total sells for 16x trailing 12-month earnings, many of the top 25 holdings pictured here sell for well above that.

Ycharts

My bottom line on ""modern dividend investing""

FDL is a good shopping list, but the all or nothing that is dividend ETF investing is fading in attractiveness for me. I have written several articles on what I am doing to adapt to the realities of modern markets, particularly how dividend ETFs are treated by algorithms and indexing factors that did not exist years ago.

And in the coming weeks and months, I aim to drill down further into my process for stock selection and, more importantly, for rotating the positions more akin to a ""hyperactive index"" than a static one like FDL offers. There was a time for dividend ETFs, but sadly, that time has passed. But at least we can do what successful investors do, but dinosaurs didn't: adapt!","The other has little to do with Morningstar, but rather with the class of dividend stocks known as ""aristocrats.""

Investment thesis

The company's management team has recently taken a series of steps to improve the financial stability of the company. Despite a significant share price decline since its Q1 earnings release where results were below management's guidance, I believe certain key metrics point to the company's platform gaining traction with its bank partners. According to my estimates, Cardlytics' (NASDAQ:CDLX) shares are fairly valued at 26 times 2025 FCF. However the company does have multiple potential growth levers that could drive FCF materially higher than my estimates, owing to the company's fixed cost business model. Nevertheless, high customer concentration and the risk for further shareholder dilution lead me to assigning a neutral rating to Cardlytics's shares.

Brief recap of recent events

Debt refinancing and capital raise

The company's CEO and CFO have been with the company since July 2022 and July 2023 respectively. Besides subsequently working on optimizing the company's cost structure, the management team has recently refinanced the company's debt by repurchasing its existing convertible note and replacing it with a $150 million convertible note, due only in 2029. The company also raised $50 million in an equity offering, which it used to resolve the dispute with SRS. These actions have left the company in a much healthier financial position, as highlighted by its CEO during the Q1 2024 earning call when he said:

With our capital needs addressed through our $50 million raise and new convertible notes not due until 2029, we are focused on higher growth rates. Our Q1 results and projected Q2 results continue to give us confidence. We have strong tailwinds behind us and we have scale that allows us to provide the best breadth and depth of offers for our banks and measurable outcomes for our advertisers.

To narrow its focus, management decided to sell its Entertainment business at the end of last year, which it had acquired in 2022 for $15 million in cash and stock.

Positive impact from the Ads Decision Engine

The company has been migrating its bank partners over to its Ads Decision Engine (ADE) which runs on AWS. ADE allows the bank's customers to see more relevant and targeted ads. Banks on its ADE platform saw a 30 percentage point difference in redemptions last quarter, versus banks that weren't. More than 80% of its bank partners are using ADE, and the company continues to upgrade the product to introduce further improvements.

Partnership with American Express

In March this year, the company entered into an agreement with American Express (AXP). This will enable Cardlytics to offer it marketing platform to American Express card members. The financial impact from this partnership still remains unknown, though the potential from American Express's large customer base remains high.

Financial highlights

Created using company data

The company's share price declined by nearly 40% following its Q1 earnings, as revenue and billings came in below management's guidance. Most importantly, the company saw a sharp increase in adjusted contribution, which was up 20% year over year as shown above. This metric was within management's guidance, and was exceptionally strong, as it was up 27% when adjusted for the loss of revenue from the divestment of Entertainment. Despite being a company specific metric, Adjusted contribution is the key metric that investors should focus on when tracking the profitable growth of the company. This was further highlighted by the company's CEO when he said:

Adjusted contribution is an important metric that reflects our business performance as it is the money we keep from our billings after paying out customer rewards and bank revenue share.

The growth in contribution profit was mainly attributed to the strong growth in redemptions, which grew 20% year over year. This has been supported by renegotiated agreements with some of its major bank partners, as well as significant improvements in its technology, such as the addition of ADE. Additionally, the company's marketing platform benefits from industry tailwinds as it offers a cookie-less identity solution.

Though adjusted EBITDA was $0.2 million in the quarter, operating cash flow was negative $17.6 million. Despite the fixed cost nature of its business model, management expects operating expenses to normalize around $40 million, compared to the current rate of $36.8 million a quarter. The expected increase is mainly driven by investments in technology and its growth initiatives.

Management's guidance calls for 12% growth in billings in Q2, at the midpoint. Adjusted contribution is expected to be between $40 million to $45 million, which would be a growth of 13% at the midpoint. Beyond Q2, management expects growth rates to decelerate as they overlap some of the impact from re-negotiated contracts last year. Despite FCF being negative in Q1, management expects to be FCF positive in the second half of the year, together with full-year positive adjusted EBITDA.

Valuation

As the company continues to be unprofitable on a GAAP and FCF basis, it is difficult to value the business using traditional metrics. I therefore chose to base my valuation on 2025 estimates, where I expect double-digit year-over-year growth in adjusted contribution, from $180 million this year to around $200 million in 2025. Considering the company's largely fixed cost model, I expect this to translate to FCF of around $15 million. At today's share price of $8, this implies a Price to FCF of roughly 26. I consider shares to be fairly valued, given my expectation that FCF would likely double even with modest growth in adjusted contribution in 2026. This would imply a Price to 2026 FCF of approximately 13.

Despite my conclusion that shares are fairly valued, I believe there are multiple factors that could potentially drive further upside to my estimates. I will walk through some of these in the next section, and also highlight potential risks.

Potential growth drivers and risks that investors should consider

Strong growth in redemptions

Management views growth in redemptions as their North Star, as it believes it to be a leading indicator of demand for the product. Following a year-over-year growth of 20% in Q1, management expects strong growth in redemptions to continue in the upcoming quarters, as explained by its CEO when he stated:

So I think longer-term, you would see that as we continue to grow billings, we're going to, hopefully, continue to drive a lot more redemptions, but we should keep more in adjusted contributions. So you're going to see some differences in the economics for the business as a whole, but we think that we can manage that in a very healthy manner going forward.

Solid momentum in its international business

The company's international business grew over 50% year-on-year last quarter, and management expects similar growth rates in upcoming quarters. The main factor driving this is the auto-enrollment program with Lloyds (LYG), where customers no longer have to opt in for its offers. Additionally, the company also signed a new bank partner, Monzo which is now live in the UK for its 8 million customers.

Revenue potential from Bridg and the American Express partnership

I believe Bridg as well as the potential from the American Express partnership provide future optionality, that is not reflected in the company's valuation currently. In the case of Bridg, though revenue was up just 1% year over year in Q1, the company continues to onboard top regional grocers, such as the recent agreement with Giant Eagle’s Leap Media Group. Further additions like this will strengthen its Rippl network as it seeks to become an alternative in a cookie-less advertising world.

Despite the uncertainty regarding the magnitude of the impact from the partnership with American Express, even a modest revenue contribution could significantly boost the company's profitability, as it would involve minimal incremental cost.

Dependency on large banks

There are currently no competitors with a product offering like what Cardlytics has. Despite this, one of the biggest risks that the company faces is customer concentration, with the top three banks representing 85% of the bank partner contribution in 2023. If one of these large banks reduces its focus on the Cardlytics platform or chooses to leave the platform entirely, it could have a significant impact on the company. In 2022, one of its largest clients, JPMorgan Chase (JPM) acquired Figg, with the aim of bringing a similar solution in-house. Though this sort of risk is yet to play-out in the company's numbers, it is something investors should watch out for.

Shareholder dilution

Besides the risk of increased dilution due to the $150 million convertible notes due in 2029, investors also face the risk of dilution due to high stock-based compensation. Stock-based compensation for the TTM was roughly $40 million, which is more than 10% of the company's current market cap.

Conclusion

Cardlytics shares are fairly valued based on my current estimates. However there are multiple growth levers for the company, which, if successful, could drive profits significantly higher than my estimates owing to the company's fixed cost business model. However the significant risks that I've highlighted above make me stay with a Neutral rating.","BestForBest/iStock via Getty ImagesInvestment thesisThe company's management team has recently taken a series of steps to improve the financial stability of the company.

Despite a still-challenging environment for more traditional hybrid youth retailers (hybrid in this case meaning significant physical store and digital presences), American Eagle Outfitters (NYSE:AEO) has done alright since my last update, with better-than-expected sales and margin improvement.

That performance hasn’t been fully reflected in the shares, though, as the 25% gain since my last article has been outpaced by the resurgent Abercrombie & Fitch (ANF), as well as Urban Outfitters (URBN), though AEO has outperformed Levi Strauss (LEVI) and Buckle (BKE).

Already a top player in denim, and with growth at Aerie slowing, it’s fair to ask whether American Eagle can grow the business fast enough to satisfy the Street, particularly with a lot of recent upside driven by gross margin and with ongoing challenges in hitting SG&A targets. I’m still bullish on management, but with upside to mid-$20’s without more reason to get more bullish on the financials, this is a borderline call in my book.

Comps Are Getting Tougher

American Eagle’s recent performance depends a lot on how you frame the comparisons. Next to the broader “softlines” retail category, AEO’s 7% same-store growth in the last quarter is quite good (versus around 4%), likewise next to Urban Outfitters (up less than 5%) or Buckle (down 9%), but it certainly pales in comparison to the 21% growth at Abercrombie & Fitch.

What’s more, while the core American Eagle brand is doing well (up 7%), and digital continues to grow nicely (up 12%), Aerie has been slowing. Granted, the last quarter comps for Aerie (+6%) were compromised by weather-related shortfalls in swimwear (underlying ex-swim up 11%), but the business has still slowed to a low double-digit growth rate faster than I’d expected, and management’s longer-term targets now suggest high single-digit growth as the high end of expectations.

Near-term comparisons are also going to get more challenging. Fiscal Q3 sales were up 2% at AE and 12% at Aerie last year, while Q4 sales were up 6% and 13% respectively. In a slowing economy where consumers are starting to be more careful with discretionary spending, that’s a risk. So too with gross margin – those year-ago quarters saw three-point improvements in gross margin on product costs, inventory management, and clearance management changes that may be tough to replicate.

How Discretionary Is SG&A Spending?

American Eagle’s SG&A spending is going to remain a front-and-center topic, as it seems to be one of the biggest areas of concern with more bearish analysts.

Since my last update, SG&A spending has risen from a low-20%’s percentage of revenue to the high-20%’s. Management doesn’t break down all of the components here, but ad spending growth did outstrip revenue growth last year by 125bp, and I’m concerned that drivers like labor costs and store operating costs are going to be fairly stubborn. Some of this, too, is being driven by higher depreciation costs tied to recent store remodeling efforts (the store base is now about 12 years old on average and management is looking to renovate around 100 a year, or a little less than 10%).

AEO has been missing sell-side expectations for SG&A spending pretty consistently, and I’m worried that this is going to be an ongoing issue (higher SG&A levels, that is, not misses versus the Street). There’s not much that management can do about higher D&A expenses other than to stop remodeling, and likewise, I don’t think there’s much room to drive store-level costs down all that much. That leaves advertising as a possible option, but I don’t think cutting ad spending is going to be a particularly good solution.

Can Aerie Still Drive Upside?

As I said before, the slowdown in Aerie sales is a concern. The business should be far from saturation, with management talking about a $75B addressable market across intimates, softs, swimwear, and activewear, and annualizing the last quarter’s sales suggests only about 2% share of that large opportunity.

Still, growth has slowed and Aerie missed my sales expectations in both of the last years, and now management’s longer-term guidance is calling for “mid-to-high single-digit” growth from this business. Perhaps this is just conservatism on the part of management. Lululemon (LULU) is almost six times larger and still growing at a 7% comp rate while generating nearly 20% operating margin (versus a little over 16% at Aerie).

On the other hand, since FQ3’23 (the last quarter before my last article), there have only been 15 net Aerie store openings. I’m not sure if weaker sales are leading to lower capex plans or not, and it is possible that online is becoming a larger part of the business faster than the company expected, but it is interesting to me that management seems to be taking a conservative approach with what was once seen as the major growth driver for the business.

I don’t think Aerie is “broken” by any means; adjusted comps were up 11% in the last quarter, 13% in the quarter before that (FQ4’24) and 12% in FQ3’24. And perhaps setting beatable expectations makes sense in the context of how Wall Street operates. Still, I would like to see the company reinvest a little more here and reaccelerate the square footage growth for Aerie.

The Outlook

I do have some concerns over the outlook for consumer discretionary spending over the next six to 12 months, but spending on youth retail categories tends to be somewhat more resilient, so I may be too bearish there. Still, comps are getting more challenging and that could be a headwind to sentiment.

Modeling AEO, I’m looking for long-term revenue growth of around 3% to 4%, and my estimates further out are more impacted by the lower guidance for Aerie growth, as my long-term Aerie growth rate moves from a little over 10% to a little over 7%.

AEO has done better on margins than I’d expected, largely due to the gross margin line, and I’m looking for ongoing improvement over the next three years. I think the 10% operating margin target could be challenging to hit, but I think they’ll at least be comfortably in the 9%’s in FY’27. For EBITDA margin, I’m expecting around 12.5% this year, 13% next year, and 13.25% the year after. There’s definitely room to exceed that, particularly if SG&A spending improves.

For cash flow, I expect AEO to move from the lower end of the mid-single-digits to the higher end, with a long-term average of around 6% and adjusted FCF growth in the 7% to 8% range.

Discounted back, those cash flows support a fair value in the mid-$20’s. For retailers like AEO, there is often a tight relationship between margin and multiples like EV/revenue. An 8% operating margin this year (which should be conservative; I think 8.5% is possible), supports a fair value of over $24; 8.5% would take the fair value to over $25.50, and management’s target of 10% would support a 1.2x revenue multiple, or $29 on this year’s revenue.

The Bottom Line

As I said in the open, this is a borderline call. I’m concerned about the long-term growth trajectory for Aerie, but I think it can be improved. I’ve been impressed with margin improvement so far, but I’d like to see more of it coming from SG&A discipline/control. I like the momentum in the business, but I’m worried about a softer economy and tougher upcoming comps.

All told, the shares do look undervalued below the mid-$20s, and I like management. That keeps me positive, but I won’t be shocked if there’s a chance to buy these shares closer to $15 before another move up.","American Eagle’s SG&A spending is going to remain a front-and-center topic, as it seems to be one of the biggest areas of concern with more bearish analysts.
Since my last update, SG&A spending has risen from a low-20%’s percentage of revenue to the high-20%’s.
As I said before, the slowdown in Aerie sales is a concern.
Modeling AEO, I’m looking for long-term revenue growth of around 3% to 4%, and my estimates further out are more impacted by the lower guidance for Aerie growth, as my long-term Aerie growth rate moves from a little over 10% to a little over 7%.

Introduction

Market-turning points have been monitored since Jan. 2023 with three indicators: 1) The SDI (S&P 500 Sector Diffusion Index), the primary indicator, 2) The TDI (Trifecta Distribution Index), the secondary indicator, and 3) the Uptrend, the referee indicator.

If you want the source of PPO (Paper and Pencil Only) approach, please click this.

Uptrend, TDI, and SDI have a common thread of the PPO Approach which distinguishes any movement with a plus (“P”) and a minus (“m”) without considering the size differences.

Unfortunately, the majority of investors, bears, or bulls, do not recognize the current market movements, not as smooth swings on a usual market, but as ratchet shifts on a bull plateau or a ""bear-market rally"" as bears are still insisting, albeit it already passed 8 months since Oct 2023.

Is TDI An Unsung Hero?

It must be a double whammy that an unsung hero, TDI, that is a younger brother of Uptrend, reconciling brother, and SDI, a big brother. The record shows that TDI never raised his voice until June this year since Jan last year.

TDI never went up above 69%, reading 60% on May 31, 64% on May 24, and 61% on May 10. In June, it suddenly jumped over 70%, logging 75% on Jun 7, 76% on Jun 14, 75% on Jun 21 again, finally 73% Friday (Jun 28).

What this kind of abrupt change means, and why the change occurred. When I designed TDI, I tried to get a right way to deviate from Uptrend, representing SPY (the ETF of the S&P 500 Index) that overlapped about 60% with QQQ (Invesco QQQ Trust of the 100 largest non-financial Nasdaq stocks).

TDI has the entries of “Tp” or “Tm” when 3 components - SPY, DIA (Dow Jones Industrial Average), and QQQ - move up or down together. Therefore, in June Tp and Tm had only 9 out of 19, splitting 6 TP and only 3 in Tm, and other 10 entries were filled with 5”S” (only 1 “P”, bearish) and 5“D” (2 “P”s, bullish). TDI is the secondary indicator. In other words, if three components (SPY, DIA, and QQQ) have the same sign (plus or minus), count, otherwise not count.

Since Oct 2023, we have seen a completely new environment of the market, away from a normal swing to a ratchet shift, hence, not only most investors, commentators, even financial media outlets are confused, but also one of my trustful indicators, TDI, has revealed some contradictory signals which disagree with SDI and Uptrend.

Why has TDI zoomed in June suddenly?

First, DIA and SPY (with QQQ) are largely decoupled, meaning one rises and the other falls, and vice versa. The former is a price index, while the latter are market-capital averaged. In recent weeks, some sector rotations between big sectors, representing SPY and small sector, representing Russell 2000 IWM.

Second, TDI has been a similar trend with IWM. The divergence between IWM and SPY made 10 sessions without Tm or Tp out of 19. If TDI gets some of 5”S” which are bearish, a lower percentage than 73% possibly retained.

Both bears and bulls are in a conundrum in their views on the market, so both camps are depressed because bears are disappointed by seeing the prolonged ""bear-market rally"", and on the other side, bulls are anxious to have a straight upswing.

A Salt in a Spoiled Market?

Yes, an adage says, ""An epoch makes a Hero"". TDI tries to make two groups comfortable, signaling a bear market but a deeply discounted threshold of a bear market, not -20% within a year, but -10% in 2 - 3 years.

The Treasury Yield Curve [TYC]

In 4 weeks in June, the Federal Reserve's [Fed] Long (10 years or so) Forecasting Model [FLFM] has continuously optimized the TYC online. One of the remarkable outcomes is that TYC focuses on the Yield Curve Stiffness [YCS] on Friday (Jun 28), as shown in Table 4.

The FLFM seems to recognize the somewhat urgency to set the YCS in a right way to stabilize global economy by allowing the BLM a temporary leeway. On June 21 [F], however, FLFM fixed the Bank Lending Margins [BLM] (Table 5).

YCS and BLM

The 1M, 2Y, 10Y, and 30Y in terms of BPs on Jun 7, Jun 14, Jun 21, and Jun 28 were:

1M: 535, 534, 520, and 535, which remains somewhat constant,

2Y: 490, 472, 474, and 475, which were highly downward,

10Y: 444, 425, 426, and 439, which were slightly downward, and

30Y: 456, 428, 440, and 4.55, which were moderately downward.

YCS, on Jun 7, Jun 14, Jun 21, and 28, has changed 8 (highly negative), 20 (very highly negative), 10 (highly negative), and -9 (highly positive) in Table 4. While BLM has been 9 (highly negative), -1 (slightly positive), 1 (neutral), and 11 (highly negative in Table 5).

Note that YCS and BLM have changed their positions, completely opposite way one to the other: YCS from worst to best while BLM from best to worst.

A long end, 30Y, was a tick down from 444BPs to 439BPs, and a short end, 2Y, fell down from 490BPs to 475BPs for the same period, as shown in Table 3.

The Fed rolled over 2y to 10Y, not to 1M, as it did before. On the top of it, global central banks and investors bought 10Y more than 2Y, perhaps expecting better economy in the coming months. Both 1M (the shortest) and 30Y (the longest) remain about the same.

The Outcome of the Pulses Check

The pulse checks of SDI, TDI, and Uptrend were 51%, 73%, and 63%, respectively Friday (Jun 28), that were a bit better than last week: 51%, 75%, and 64%, respectively, as of Jun 21 [F].

Pulse Check #1 by The SDI (The S&P 500 Sector Diffusion Index)

The First Checker, SDI logged 51% in Table 6, which was upbeat optimal

SDI stayed the same at 51% on Jun 28 [F]. SDI is a diffusion index, so slightly more than 50%, about 6 sectors out of 11, are positive. The positive sectors can tally from Table 6, as: 1) XLK (Tech) 13Ps, 2) XLY (cons discretionary) 11Ps. 3) XLV (health care) 11Ps, 4) XLC (comm services) 11Ps, 5) XLF (Financial) 10Ps, and 6) XLRE (Real Estate) 10Ps.

Pulse Check #2 by The TDI (Trifecta Distribution Index)

The Second Checker, on Jun 7 TDI was 75% which was a maximum pulse to be acceptable. On Jun 14, TDI was an inch up to 76%. As a result, the pulse of the plateau was above the upper bound of 75%, resulting the pulse was too many to harm the health of the plateau.

Fortunately, Friday (Jun 21), a weakened S&P 500 helped TDI come back to 75%. Friday (Jun 28), I did not know TDI’s outcome until last hour. The market was solid in the premarket and until 3:00 ET the market indices were positive, so I didn’t expect for SPY to slide. Alas, three major indexes were down significantly, except Russell 2000 [IWM}.

As a result, TDI made it again:

TDI: 73% = 100*16/(16+6) is acceptable. Bulls vs. Bears was 16 (=10 (May) + 6 (Jun)) vs.6 (= 3 (May) + 3 (Jun)).

If you are a trifecta trader, you must be interested in summary Table of Table 7 and ""TP/Tm"" column in Table 2.

Market Perspective

In the first half of the year [H1], S&P 500 Index has performed very well, making 31 times all-time flash records. It ascended 14% in H1, and advanced 4% quarterly since March 29. In June, it rose +17.7% monthly (%CH.2), and +0.1% weekly (%CH.3), and closed -0.4% at $5,460 that is a hair shy(-0.3%) of an all-time high at 5,487 on Jun 18 [T], as reported in Table1.

Friday (Jun 28) Personal Consumption Expenditures (PCE) prices were flat in May, down from 0.3% in April. Core PCE, which strips out food and energy, rose 0.1% in May, also down from 0.3% in April, and headline and core annual PCE both rose 2.6%.

Fed policy is also front and center next week, highlighted by Fed Chairman Jerome Powell's appearance in a policy panel discussion at the European Central Bank (ECB) Forum on Central Banking in Portugal at 9:30 a.m. ET Tuesday.

But next Friday's June nonfarm payrolls report stands out in terms of importance. Early expectations are for a sharp pullback in jobs growth from May's swollen 272,000. The jobs growth in May raised eyebrows, coming in about 100,000 above analysts' expectations. It could be interesting to see if the government reduces that figure on its second look.

The equity market is expected to move by ratchet shifts, with a tight band of +/- 5%. The bond market seems not to be a proper investing ballpark for most individual investors who don't have a big pocket.

Bears think the band is a bear-market call, seeing the lower bound while bulls view it a bull-market call, believing the plateau theory. Bulls and bears invest and trade in a same ground. How long? All I can say is at least 2-3 years until 2008 or longer, depending largely upon the signal of TDI. Soft Landing calls Santa Claus rally.

Conclusion

The TYC and the S&P 500 Index (SPY, the ETF of S&P 500) were coupled, and the stiffener of TYC was lifted, so the market is expected to be more bullish in a few weeks.

Investing is a probability game [PG]:

Picking right cash cows in the premarket or regular sessions is PG. Selecting three speculative stocks (less than $10), and one hits the target is also PG. The target is not just 1% but 10% or more, if I am lucky, but not often at all.

I have a few house rules to minimize intraday-trading risk:

1) At least 40% are dividends paying stocks, some of which I hold for many years.

2) 40% is AI related stocks.

3) 20% for any stocks. I am an equal-opportunity intraday trader.","Trifecta Distribution Index [TDI] Data: Jun (1 - 28) DATE SPY DIA QQQ SPY DIA QQQ Tp/Tm 05/31/24 528.06 387.82 451.46 * * * * 06/03/24 527.96 386.23 453.38 m m P S 06/04/24 528.54 387.65 454.33 P P P Tp 06/05/24 534.43 388.50 463.55 P P P Tp 06/06/24 534.38 389.30 463.33 m P m S 06/07/24 533.77 388.44 462.77 m m m Tm 06/10/24 535.35 378.97 464.51 P m P D 06/11/24 537.19 387.95 468.57 P P P Tp 06/12/24 542.27 387.56 476.89 P m P D 06/13/24 542.44 386.70 477.18 P m P D 06/14/24 542.78 386.46 479.19 P m P D 06/17/24 547.03 388.87 484.67 P P P Tp 06/18/24 548.45 389.10 485.32 P P P Tp 06/20/24 546.80 392.09 481.69 m P m S 06/21/24 544.72 391.43 480.85 m m m Tm 06/24/24 542.68 394.02 474.09 m P m S 06/25/24 544.69 390.77 479.17 P m P D 06/26/24 544.68 390.86 479.00 m P m S 06/27/24 546.56 391.87 482.01 P P P Tp 06/28/24 545.06 391.52 479.87 m m m Tm NOTE 1.

Seeking Alpha,https://seekingalpha.com/article/4701983-alphawave-not-enough-value-to-mitigate-the-risk?source=feed_all_articles,2024-07-02,08:12:23 UTC,Alphawave: Not Enough Value To Mitigate The Risk (OTCMKTS:AWEVF),"Shutthiphong Chandaeng/iStock via Getty Images

In my opinion, there could be a chance of Alphawave (OTCPK:AWEVF) delivering significant returns over the next 1-2 years. However, because I believe the value in the stock is not ideal, despite a contracting P/S ratio since its IPO, I am putting out a Hold rating rather than a Buy rating. Alphawave has the potential for strong growth in the semiconductor connectivity sector and is particularly involved with AI and data infrastructure markets. However, the company has faced accusations about its accounting practices, and there are profitability concerns, including a loss at this time, as it continues to invest in R&D and growth. In addition, its position in the AI and data center ecosystem is not secure enough to warrant a large allocation at the moment. My overall sentiment is that while the reward could be high from this investment, the risk is also very high and makes an investment in the company somewhat speculative right now.

Operational Analysis

Alphawave has expanded its IP product portfolio to over 235 IPs, which cover interfaces required in data centers. Management has also announced successful tape-outs on TSMC's (TSM) 3nm process and joined the Arm Total Design ecosystem. Management has also been developing its partnership with Samsung (OTCPK:SSNLF) Foundry, focusing on advanced semiconductor nodes and high-speed connectivity solutions for AI and HPC systems. These areas of progress position the company well for future growth, although its market position is not yet fully secured, and investors need to be careful because of the valuation.

Alphawave has also faced accusations surrounding its accounting practices, leading to the company having to suspend its shares due to audit delays. These areas of fiduciary concerns are likely to deter investment in the company. In 2022 and 2023, Alphawave had to delay the publication of its annual accounts due to audit-related issues; in April 2023, the firm was forced to suspend its shares after KPMG auditors requested more time to complete their internal oversight and assurance processes before issuing a formal audit opinion. These delays in financial reporting have unfortunately put the company more at risk of violating FCA disclosure deadlines, which has the potential to lead to regulatory scrutiny. In response, CFO Daniel Aharoni stepped down immediately following the release of the company's delayed annual results in 2023.

In my opinion, these delays and issues in financial conduct should be taken seriously, a bad track record in this regard spells trouble in the near future for investors who are looking for high levels of growth. As I mentioned in my introduction, the growth opportunity for the company here is quite large, but because of these issues, I and other investors will be cautious about allocating capital because concerns of further delays due to financial misconduct are likely to have negative reputational impacts both from investors and industry partners and clients. That being said, Alphawave's new CFO, Rahul Mathur, has a strong track record, and I believe there is some reason to believe he could lead the company successfully through a turnaround here.

These concerns being addressed, the company does have operational positives, with the company's revenue-generating end-customer base up from 80 in 2022, to 103 in 2023. As it is positioned in high-growth sectors like AI, HPC, data networking and 5G/6G infrastructure, investors are correct to be excited about the potential for the business to scale in results.

The company's efforts in creating and testing designs using TSMC's advanced 3nm semiconductor manufacturing process have allowed it to offer smaller, more efficient, and more powerful chips. Alphawave's notable next-generation technologies include:

PCIe 7.0, the latest version of the PCI Express standard, allows for the faster transfer of data between components inside a computer. 112G and 224G Ethernet, which are high-speed networking standards that enable extremely fast data transfer rates, are crucial for data centers and HPC. UCIe is the new standard for connecting different chiplets (small chips) within a larger system, allowing for more powerful and versatile chip designs.

The company has a distinct first-mover advantage because it was the first company to announce a UCIe Physical Layer Intellectual Property that supports data transfer rates of 24Gbps per lane. This positions Alphawave as a leader in the field of high-speed connectivity solutions. Customers using Alphawave's technology can build more powerful and efficient systems, which is particularly crucial in AI and data center applications.

The company is on to something here, and I believe that part of what investors may have a tendency to overlook is that the operations are strong in the invention and IP domain, but the business and financial management appear to be weaker. Therefore, if long-term investors are willing to ride any short-to-medium term volatility as a result of the company finding its feet in corporate due diligence, the firm may have a very strong future ahead as one of the foundational components in AI and data centers scaling in efficiency and capability at the chip IP level.

Financial Analysis

There has been a 74% increase in revenue as of FY 2023 end. In addition, at the end of the financial year, Alphawave's backlog reached $355 million, which, although down from $380 million at the end of 2022, is still highly promising as it indicates high current demand. Cumulative bookings reached $877 million by the end of 2023, up from $580 million in FY 2022. Q4 2023 saw record quarterly bookings up 36% YoY, and Q1 2024 saw bookings up 20% YoY.

However, the big issue investors face at the moment is that the company is operating at a loss. For FY 2023, the company reported an operating loss of $19 million, compared to an operating profit of $38 million in FY 2022. Several factors contributed to this loss, including an accelerated transition away from China:

This is mainly due to the accelerated transition away from China, and changes in expected revenue recognition of long-term contracts in advanced nodes.""

In addition, the company has increased its R&D investment, reflected in an adjusted EBITDA margin of 17% in H1 2023 compared to 41% in H1 2022. This reduction in profitability has also been caused by the addition of silicon business through acquisitions that have impacted the firm's profitability in the short term.

Despite these current concerns, management has expressed confidence in the future profitability of the company and the potential for this is evidenced in revenue growth versus net income:

Author, Using Seeking Alpha

Management is guiding toward profitability with an adjusted EBITDA margin of 20%, estimated in 2024. For 2025, the company is guiding for an adjusted EBITDA margin up to 25%. While the company has not provided a specific date for when it expects to achieve overall profitability, the current EBITDA guidance is a good sign that the company is looking to ease its R&D and operational changes to return to a focus on profit.

In my opinion, now could turn out to be an incredibly opportune time to invest if the company begins to scale its earnings reliably moving forward. However, there could be further development costs that arrive, which means that the company faces further periods of loss as it invests to stay competitive and current. I think this is somewhat likely because AI and data center capacities and capabilities are expanding so quickly, and the demands from AI users are scaling so exponentially that the likelihood of further periods of high R&D to meet demand is high.

Valuation Analysis

The company began its IPO at a P/S ratio of 92.5; now, the ratio is around 4.2. The company has a median P/S ratio over the period of 11.17. Therefore, the company is arguably undervalued if we take into account the entire history. However, it is more likely that the company has been significantly overvalued for most of its history, and we should also take note that the sector median P/S ratio is around 3.

Data by YCharts

I think investors are taking on valuation risk despite the fact that the P/S ratio is much lower than historically. Because of the high R&D costs that the company could face in the future to remain competitive, it is unlikely that AWEVF stock is undervalued at this time. The opportunity rests in that the company could deliver exceptional growth if its partnerships and IP become more popular as data center demands increase and AI scales, but there are likely to be multiple headwinds, which include the financial and accounting issues that have caused suspensions previously, and concerns that I have about whether the new CFO will have enough of a stringent focus on profit and efficiency within the company to drive financial success.

The results received by shareholders significantly rest on how the company manages its profitability moving forward - there are likely to be further hurdles, and I am concerned about investing because there is no upside here based on value alone, which makes the future for investors highly uncertain and purely based on the ability of the company to scale its revenue and manage this efficiently. To date, there is not enough evidence that the company will manage this, including the fact that the accounting scandals show some lack of financial prudence.

Analysis of Competitive Risks

There are multiple large and new-entrant competitors to Alphawave, which could inhibit its future success. Broadcom (AVGO) and Marvell (MRVL) are two high-threat competitors who both focus heavily on AI and data center applications. In addition, while Nvidia's (NVDA) threat is less acute, its focus on AI and data centers could overlap with Alphawave's target markets. It is likely that if Alphawave scales its operations, larger big tech companies focused on semiconductor solutions will seek to acquire it, in my opinion.

There are also the newer entrants, which include three I have identified as potentially the highest threat. Black Semiconductor works on graphene-based optical interconnects for chips, aligning closely with Alphawave's focus on high-speed connectivity solutions. NanoBridge Semiconductor has a novel NanoBridge switch technology for more efficient chip designs - it is a Japanese startup with key connections in Asian markets, which Alphawave is now moving away from. Skycore is less developed, but its work on switched-capacitor integrated circuits is relevant to high-performance chip design and high-speed connectivity. Of these, Black Semiconductor, which recently secured €254 million in funding and focuses directly on chip interconnects, is likely the highest threat, in my opinion.

There is also Arm Holdings (ARM), which is a significant competitor to Alphawave, with a strong focus on AI and data centers. However, the company is also Alphawave's collaborator, as I mentioned in my operational analysis above. While the ARM Total Design collaboration is likely to be accretive to both parties, the competitive dynamic is likely to grow because they both operate on a licensing model, competing for the same customer base in the semiconductor industry. ARM has a competitive edge here because it has a more established reputation and an extensive ecosystem.

In summary, Alphawave has niche areas of USPs in specific semiconductor IP, but investors must recognize that there are many other players who could fulfill the roles Alphawave is playing in the semiconductor industry related to AI and data center semiconductor IP. Alphawave must continue to compete in innovation while crucially managing the line between growth and profitability. Over the long term, this is unlikely to be as easy as management is guiding for in the near term, in my opinion.

Conclusion

I was initially optimistic when I first discovered Alphawave. However, on further analysis, I have become more cautious and am currently not allocating capital. Primary to my thesis here is that the future growth of the company is dependent on its ability to sustain profitability and grow this over the long term. It has not proven this reliably yet, and there is not any deep value in the stock to warrant an allocation despite the future growth uncertainty. I have also grown concerned that during future periods of high R&D to remain innovative, the company may require more debt financing and equity raising, which it has already been prone to in the past.

I think that if management can fix the accounting and financial issues that have been present in the company and generate a more reliable profitability strategy moving forward, this could be a high-growth investment. However, there are multiple areas of uncertainty in this, which include competitive threats and a potentially consolidating AI and data center ecosystem with major players like Nvidia, Broadcom, and other technology leaders potentially blocking out major growth from competition.

I am placing a HOLD rating on CompX International Inc. (NYSE:CIX) because I believe that CIX's share price is likely to fall in 2024 due to the conclusion of a pilot project related to the company selling security products to the United States Postal Service as well as a continued downward trend in its marine component sales. While CIX has proven itself to be a well run business which should continue to prosper on a long-term horizon, a decrease in CIX's sales figures should give potential buyers of this stock a better buy opportunity in the near future.

About CompX International Inc.

CIX has two distinct business segments that make up the company as a whole. One of these segments is primarily engaged in selling security products for a wide assortment of applications. These security products come in many forms and include mechanical and electrical cabinet locks, ignition systems, mailboxes, file cabinets, desk drawers, tool storage cabinets, high security medical cabinetry, secured narcotics boxes, electrical circuit panels, storage compartments, gas station security, and vending and cash containment machines. The other segment of CIX's business is its marine components segment, which manufactures components for boat exhaust systems, wake enhancement systems, as well as a variety of precision gauges for things like tachometers, speedometers, and GPS systems.

CompX's Complicated Ownership Structure

While Loretta J. Feehan, Michael S. Simmons, Scott C. James, Amy A. Samford, and Amy E. Ruf run operations for CIX with the help of directors Thomas E. Barry, Terri L. Herrington, Ann Manix, Gina A. Norris, and Mary A. Tidlund this business has a much more complex structure than most publicly traded companies.

CIX operates its business as a subsidiary to NL Industries, Inc. (NYSE:NL) who owns 87% of the company's stock. NL also owns Kronos Worldwide, Inc. (NYSE:KRO), which is a global giant in titanium dioxide production which sees use under a large variety of applications for a variety of purposes. NL Industries is in turn run as a subsidiary to another publicly traded company called Valhi Inc. (NYSE:VHI) which owns 83% of NL Industries' common stock. Then another company, Contran Corporation, through one of its subsidiaries, owns 91% of Valhi's stock.

The Contran Corporation And Lisa Simmons

The Contran Corporation is a holding company set up by an extremely successful Texas billionaire named Harold Simmons, who passed away in 2014. After his death, control of the Contran Corporation and its four publicly traded subsidiaries was passed along to two of his daughters, Lisa K. Simmons and Serena Simmons Connelly.

A portion of the Contran Corporation's shares are owned by trusts controlled by these two daughters for the benefit of the family and their children. In 2020, Serena unfortunately passed away from cancer and her portion of the shares were then passed to her husband, Thomas Connelly. There is a stipulation that Thomas Connelly has to use his portion of the Contran Corporation's shares owned through those trusts to vote in the same manner as Lisa Simmons until April 22, 2030.

The chairmen, Principal Executive Officer, Principal Financial Officer, Principal Accounting Officer, and directors are in most cases the same people running all of these public companies and Lisa Simmons' control of the Contran Corporation gives her a lot of power when it comes to controlling these entities. This could be a good thing or a bad thing depending on who this individual is.

If a change of leadership were to be in order, one person in control could become quite the impediment to that change, however a single dependable, predictable, owner could, on the other hand, lead to long-term business stability. It can be rather hard to find any information on Lisa K. Simmons' relationship to these various businesses she has so much stake in. Most of the information you'll find looking into her relates to the various charitable organizations she runs. This leaves us to look to the historical records of the many publicly traded companies she has ownership in so we can look for clues on how we might expect CIX to be run in the future.

A Look Closer Look At More Public Companies Under Contran Corporation's Control

CIX itself has had a pretty consistent 10 years of growth in both their revenues and net income.

CIX Revenues (Seeking Alpha) CIX Net Income (Seeking Alpha)

CIX has managed to increase these figures while keeping their liabilities relatively stable.

CIX Liabilities (Seeking Alpha)

KRO, the other subsidiary of NL Industries, is a bit more of a cyclical business, but you can still see signs of long-term stability in their revenue, net income, and liability figures.

KRO Revenues (Seeking Alpha) KRO Net Income (Seeking Alpha) KRO Liabilities (Seeking Alpha)

NL Industries has used its ownership of both KRO and CIX to smooth out its sources of revenue. However, NL has had a lot of liabilities from a lead paint lawsuit related to lead use in Dutch Boy Paints back in the 1970s and whether or not the company was liable to pay for clean-up efforts from homes contaminated with this lead paint.

This lawsuit has troubled the company since the year 2000 and in 2018 NL Industries was finally fined over $100 million for their liability under a settlement agreement. The large amounts of legal fees and fines NL received has led to some bumpy net income figures. Keep in mind NL Industries stopped selling Dutch Boy Paint with lead in the mixture in 1978, so I don't think I would necessarily say it's fair to blame NL's current management team or Lisa and Serena for this specific problem, and it does look like the worst of these non-reoccurring liabilities to be behind the company.

On NL's 2023 10-K the company still had $13.49 million in current liabilities directly related to environmental remediation and litigation settlements. NL still has another $105.57 million in noncurrent liabilities related to these environmental remediations and litigation settlements as well.

NL's Revenues (Seeking Alpha) NL's Net Income (Seeking Alpha) NL's Liabilities (NL's 2023 10-K)

VHI has seen revenue growth that's fairly stable since 2015, but VHI's debt has cut into the company's profits and made their net income sporadic. As you can see though, VHI has spent the last decade reducing their long-term debt by $374 million, and it does appear like the company is setting itself up for better long-term profitability.

VHI's Revenues (Seeking Alpha) VHI's Net Income (Seeking Alpha) VHI's Liabilities (Seeking Alpha)

The 10-year time frame from which I've shared these companies' financial information also happens to be the timeframe when Lisa and Serena Simmons took over the company. As you can see, the management that has overseen these companies since then seems to have been able to keep a lid on things. Over this period, all of these companies have experienced a reduction to their total liabilities. NL Industries has never carried more than around $500,000 in long-term debt, CIX carries no long-term debt, and VHI has significantly reduced its long-term debt from $919.7 million at the end of 2014 to $511.2 million in Q1 of 2024. KRO is the only company out of the bunch that has increased its long-term debt load.

While these businesses have some cyclicality to them, it does appear like they have a steady long-term growth trajectory. While I don't see anything that screams, ""Contran Corporation has a rock star management team"" the crew running these companies do appear competent and if any of the companies under Contran Corporation's control do end up looking like buys the management team would not give me a reason to shy away from my purchase.

CompX's 2023

CIX saw its revenues decrease by 3.2% from $166.6 million in 2022 to $161.3 million in 2023. Despite the drop in revenue, CIX saw its operating income stay the same at $25.4 million in both 2022 and 2023. The company also saw an 8.3% increase in net income from $20.9 million in 2022 to $22.6 million in 2023. This stability in operating income was due to a 4.8% lower cost of sales figure from a $117.8 million in 2022 to a $112.1 million in 2023. The increase in CIX's net income despite its decrease in revenues is due to a 122.1% increase in interest income earned from the company's outstanding investments between 2022 and 2023 from $1.9 million to $4.2 million.

CIX's Income Statement 2023 (From CIX's 2023 10-K)

When looking at CIX's revenues broken down by business segment, you can see a sharp 23% decrease in net sales for their marine components segment from $52.1 million in 2022 to $40.1 million in 2023.

CIX's Sales And Income From their Marine Components Segment (CIX's 2023 10-K)

This decrease in sales for CIX's marine components was partly offset by a 9.0% increase in net sales for their security products, from $114.5 million in 2022 to $121.2 million in 2023.

CIX's Sales And Income From Their Security Products Segment (CIX's 2023 10-K)

In 2023 CIX was able to largely offset the decreases from their marine components business segment by a nice sized increase in sales from their security products segment. Most of this increase in security product sales was due to a pilot program for the United States Postal Service. The USPS accounted for 24% of CIX's 2023 security product sales, 11% of which were sales towards a pilot project that should not be expected to be a reoccurring source of income for the company. Had CIX not supplied products for this pilot project, then their overall sales in security products would have actually seen a YOY decline.

CompX's 2024 Q1

Looking at CIX's Q1 of 2024 we don't yet see a decline in the sale of the company's security products. We actually see another 9% YOY increase in new sales of the company's security products but, we can also see a further 41.5% YOY decline in the company's marine components products from $13.8 million to $8.1 million.

CIX's Sale And Income Statement For Q1 Of 2024 (CIX's 2024 Q1 10-Q)

The poor performance from their marine components segment really drove down CIX's operating income from $7.0 million to $3.7 million from 2023's Q1 to 2024's Q1, a 47.2% drop. This led to a 38.1% YOY decrease in CIX's net income from $6.1 million in Q1 of 2023 to $3.8 million in Q1 of 2024.

CIX's Income Statement For Q1 Of 2024 (CIX's 2024 Q1 10-Q)

CompX's Discounted Cash Flow

I ran a discounted cash flow on CIX so we can get a better picture at what the long-term value of this company is in its current state. I assumed that CIX would experience a 2.0% decrease in revenues in 2024 before growing at a slower 5.5% rate through 2033. CIX had been rapidly growing their revenues at a rate of 23% between 2020 and 2021 and 18.3% between 2021 and 2022 however a 5.5% growth rate is more in line with their historical revenue growth. This figure fits between the 5.2% growth in revenue CIX experienced if you take their 10-year revenue average from 2014 to their current 2024 TTM average and the company's 6.1% growth rate if you just average the official revenue growth from 2014 to 2023. I also assumed a 14.0% EBIT rate as this has been the company's average EBIT rate from 2019 to 2023, and a 24% tax rate as this has been a pretty consistent effective tax rate for the company after 2018 when the corporate tax rate was lowered from 35% to 21%.

I put CIX's capital expenditures at 2.0% of CIX's revenues, depreciation and amortization charges at $4.0 million a year, and a change in working capital as a percentage of revenue at 10%. I then assumed that after 2033 the company would experience a perpetual growth rate of 2.0%.

Discounted Cash Flow For CIX (Leland Roach)

After running these numbers through my DCF, I wind up with just a 4.67% upside on our target price versus the $24.20 price tag that CIX's shares currently sit at. As it sits now, it appears that CIX is fairly priced and not currently a bargain.

CompX's Theoretical Liquidation Value

I also ran a very simple theoretical liquidation analysis of CIX just to get an idea of what the actual value of the company would be worth if it had to sell off everything it owned.

CIX Theoretical Liquidation Value ( By Leland Roach )

Most of CIX's assets are things like solid physical assets, marketable securities, and cash. The only thing I subtracted from CIX's total assets was the goodwill the company had on its balance sheet. Since goodwill is nothing more than what a company had paid for something above its tangible value, it's not likely a company could pass off its goodwill as something worth hard cash in the event of a liquidation.

After subtracting the goodwill from CIX's balance sheet, I then subtracted a 21% tax rate to compensate for the tax expense CIX would likely be subject to in the event they did sell their business. Once you divide the end result of $124.8 million by the 12.31 million shares the company has outstanding, we reach our estimated liquidation value of $10.14 a share, which is $14.06 per share lower than CIX's current share price of $24.20. That's a 58.1% downside in tangible business value compared to CIX's current share price.

My Hold Rating For CompX

When considering CIX's sales outlook for their fiscal 2024, their discounted cashflow projections, and that the company is trading at $14.06 a share above what the company is worth in a liquidation scenario, I am obligated to give CIX a HOLD rating. I think that the company's expected decrease in sales should bring the stock into a more reasonable price point. At $21.10 a share, CIX's DCF would show the potential for a possible upside of 20% or more, which is normally the beginning of a buy rating for me if the company has a fairly priced liquidation value. In this case, however, CIX shows a price to book ratio of 1.76 and a theoretical liquidation value downside of 58.1%.

While I think that the company's history with consistent long-term growth should be considered an insulating factor when considering whether to buy into this company or not, you'd still have to buy in at a price that makes this liquidation value risk worth your while. I would have to see at least a potential for a 30% upside from the stock's current price to justify a buy rating. In the case of CIX that price is around $19.50 a share.

As more disappointing news of declining sales begin to come in with each 10-Q, CIX's share price may dip even lower than $19.50 a share. As you can see, the company's share price has risen between $20.00 and $26.00 multiple times over the course of the past five years before falling into the $18.00 range before again rising to new highs.

CIX's Share Price History (Seeking Alpha)

It's definitely not unreasonable to think that this could happen again, as the company has only reported its first financial quarter of what it expects to be a year full of disappointing sales figures. If the share price dips below this $19.50 threshold during this time period, I would use it as an opportunity to scoop up more shares. If the stock just simply continues what currently appears to be another upward trajectory closer to or above the $30.00 mark, then you still have made a healthy profit on what you've already invested.

When I Would Sell

I would strongly consider selling my shares of CIX if prospects for the company's sales don't start to improve by Q2 of 2025. It's impossible to say where the economy is going to be exactly one year from now, but CIX has a long record of steady growth. Security products are likely to remain an important business for as long as I can tell, but the marine components industry has a much larger potential for a dramatic downturn should the economy fall into a large recession or interest rates stay elevated for long periods of time.

A large part of CIX's marine components are sold for recreational use. If the economy were to take a sudden downturn or prolonged periods of high interest rates continue for too long, then discretionary spending on things like recreational boating is going to be the first thing consumers are going to stop paying for. I think this would be the most likely catalyst for a prolonged downturn in CIX's business. If you own this stock or are looking for an opportunity to buy into this stock, I would highly suggest keeping an eye out for all things related to the recreational boating and recreational boating components market. Developments in these markets could bring signs of what CIX's future sales may look like.

Conclusion

I am giving CIX a HOLD rating because although I believe CIX's long-term growth prospects to be good, I do think that the company will likely experience a drop in sales volumes that will cause a drop in the share price that will be low enough to possibly warrant another accumulation of shares. Currently, CIX's shares are priced fairly in most respects, and an investor holding on to this stock past any dip in 2024 should still see some profit in the long term. Should share prices fall below $19.50, provided no new relevant changes happen to the company's future sales outlook, I would consider putting a buy rating on CIX. If CIX doesn't see some sign of sales improving by Q2 of 2025, I would consider selling this stock.","CIX Revenues (Seeking Alpha) CIX Net Income (Seeking Alpha)CIX has managed to increase these figures while keeping their liabilities relatively stable.

Investment Thesis

To begin with, Jumia (NYSE: JMIA), a company I regard as a juggernaut in its own space, is not currently in its best position. I believe the problems it is going through could be temporary provided it makes all the right decisions. Macro-economic headwinds are the company's biggest problems and in my opinion are beyond its control. Based on my analysis, if the company can take major steps towards spreading beyond overreliance on a particular segment and market, its struggles can be a thing of the past. Therefore, Jumia (NYSE: JMIA) has a hold rating from me.

Introduction

Jumia is Africa's leading e-commerce platform with $244 million in revenue in 2023, and ~24 million active customers; it operates in the following segments; online marketplace, logistics and payment services.

Jumia has managed to create a niche market for itself in Africa boldly dominating the space. With over half of the e-commerce market share, Nigeria is Jumia's biggest market and a large chunk of its operations are based there, so is a large portion of its revenue from its operations there.

The case for Jumia

The thing with Jumia is that despite its juggernaut status in Africa, it still has a lot of things it needs to work on. Having an e-commerce platform with only 24 million active customers- on rough estimate is still quite low for an e-commerce platform. Though in Africa, as an investor currently on the continent, I know that access to the Internet and onboarding of Technology is a whole lot better than that.

Not very fair for a comparison but I'll use it anyway. Amazon has ~230 million customers in the United States, a country with access to the Internet of about 322 million as of March 2024. This represents about 71.4 percent of the population with Internet access. Now, my case for Jumia and arguably so is that the number of persons with access to the Internet in Nigeria (one of its markets in Africa) is 154.8 million as of 2023, it has obviously grown as of now. Therefore, Jumia’s juggernaut status in Africa accounts for only 15.5 percent of the population of active internet users in Nigeria (using the estimated 24 million annual e-commerce platform customers), now this is not accounting for Africa as a whole.

I'm not undermining its position as the leading e-commerce platform in the continent, but I'm just highlighting that it has a potential wider and by far larger market than it is holding onto. I'll blame this largely to the lack of competition in the space. Jumia should be less comfortable with being just the largest one and really dominate the space.

Then there's the currency issue

Nigeria is Jumia's biggest market. The country's proprietary currency the Naira has seen one of the worst devaluations among currencies in the past year. Highlighting longer time frames such as within the past 3 years and 5 years, the picture looks even more grim. However, for the sake of my analysis, I would be using the past year.

Jumia NYSE: JMIA performance report (Yahoo Finance - Stock Market Live, Quotes, Business & Finance News)

While new holders (within the past year) of the stock have their investments in the green. Investors who have owned the stock for periods of 3 to 5 years have seen near abysmal losses around the -75% to -76% range. While I would partially believe that that would be widely linked to the intense devaluation of the Naira within the period, but at the same time, within the past year, it has seen a 116% increase, while the Nigerian Naira has decreased in value by about 2.34 times its former value [using the Annual average exchange rate of one U.S dollar in Nigerian naira (NGN)]. Within the past 3 and 5 years it has decreased ~3.78 times and 4.61 times its value respectively.

Not being too intricate now, but apart from the Nigerian Naira devaluation and the inflation in the country's economy which is considerably worse in the past year, I believe its previous poor performance should be linked to something else (that is to say in context, it has been having a poor financial performance over the past year, however, when the Nigerian economy was significantly worse and witnessed its worst currency devaluation, Jumia managed to record an impressive stock performance). This being said, acknowledging that Nigeria is just one of its markets, though its largest.

Segments Review

Jumia's operations are based on the following segments;

Online Marketplace (e-commerce) business

Logistics business

Payment services

Online Marketplace (e-commerce) business

Jumia's online marketplace, which has mostly been addressed earlier in this analysis, is the biggest of its segments. A majority of its customers are based in a single market- Nigeria.

Nigeria is currently in a not so pleasant economic situation, which according to the business is affecting its e-commerce business.

Its competitors in the e-commerce (online marketplace) space includes; jiji and Konga (see statista's e-commerce research). On a bigger scope (in Africa), its dominance is still unrivaled with its customer base being over double its nearest competitor.

Logistics business

Jumia's Logistics business (Jumia com)

Its logistics business, though regarded as a segment, is majorly dependent on its e-commerce business. This service mostly deals with delivery of goods purchased on its e-commerce platform. Further, it doesn't have the monopoly of this as both customers and sellers on the platform can opt for other delivery methods. I see this as a red flag as it widely limits the potential of the segment, making it impossible to stand alone. Low sales in its e-commerce business will inevitably affect the logistics business. Operating in an industry with the size of ~US$10 billion (in Nigeria) opens up a window of intense opportunities. However, Jumia seems to be struggling in this regard as it recently suspended its 'logistics as a service' business, losing the potential of tapping into this large market.

Payment service business

Jumia's payment service (Jumia.com)

Valued at over $22 billion in 2022, the Nigerian payment services industry positions as another potential market for Jumia. In the 2023 financial year, its proprietary payment service JumiaPay handled transactions to the tune of $192.2 million dollars (this covers all its operations in all its markets), showing its ability to effectively handle large amounts and volumes of payments. However, quoting directly from its 2023 financial reports,

“JumiaPay Transactions corresponds to the total number of orders for products and services on our marketplace for which JumiaPay was used, irrespective of cancellations or returns, for the relevant period.”

Indicating that outside the Jumia e-commerce marketplace, this segment is equally not up to its full potential as a majority of its transactions are related to its e-commerce business (however, it also handles other forms of payments outside its e-commerce business). I personally think that this is sad seeing that based on the amount of transactions it handles, there's no major statement of its relevance outside the e-commerce space. Again to note that despite strides, if the e-commerce business suffers, this segment suffers also. Should the company plan to dive fully into the market, major competitors would be Opay, Palmpay, Flutterwave, Paystack, etc, with significantly higher market share.

This goes without saying, I believe that both its logistics business and payment service business should evolve to be independent from its e-commerce business. It has operated in the African space long enough to at least attempt to properly market the idea to its large customer base.

Financials

Its earnings per share of the past 12 months (EPS TTM) is -1.09, that's not good looking forward as an investor, even though I know that projecting past performance forward is not the most logical investment analysis, I believe it generally gives a picture of the company. I mean what's the point of history if we won't at least try to learn from it (though projecting past performance forward will not give an accurate picture of the company's future performance, it will definitely help in seeing its current standing and would also help to create an outlook to work with).

So, it had a revenue of $186 million in the past fiscal year, this is darkened by its operating loss of $78 million (~42% of total revenue). It has been able to manage the decrease in its liquidity, a good one from that end.

Speaking to its shareholders in its report for 2023, it acknowledged the above highlighted economic issues I predicted.

“Upheavals on the global stage have had a significant impact on African economies and its people. High inflation rates and currency depreciation have led to a scarcity of supply and have adversely impacted the purchasing power of customers. These have been challenging times for tech and retail businesses across the continent. Against that unsettling backdrop, we embarked on a fundamental transformation of our company in order to rapidly improve our financials and establish a stronger foundation for our e-commerce business. This transformation obviously came with a painful short-term impact, as we discontinued activities with poor growth prospects, stopped expensive marketing practices, and radically streamlined our organization…”

Further, highlighted its commitment to axe off business activities and segments that are causing the ship to sink.

“We believe that Jumia is now a much leaner, more agile and more focused company. We have reevaluated our portfolio and made tough decisions regarding business activities that did not bring the right value. Recently, we discontinued our food delivery operations as we concluded that the growth prospects did not justify the complexity it created. We believe our focus and resources will be better invested in our physical goods business, where we see more opportunity for revenue growth and higher margins.”

However, regardless of its commitments and encouragement to shareholders, I see its financials in a mess, its assets to liabilities ratio shows liabilities is about 64.2%, this is a high risk especially since its major problems based on my analysis and also confirmed by itself is majorly macro-economic, as such it is very much our of its control.

By means of a holistic analysis

While there are double digits revenue increases in constant currency, there happens to be a decline in the reported currency (USD). Further, its reduction in operating costs, improvements in gross profits gives it a positive outlook moving forward. However, it also needs to address its reducing liquidity and decreasing cash flows. Most of the negativity, I attribute to the devaluation of the Naira in its main market, reflecting how dangerous it is as it can make positive steps forward look like steps in the opposite direction. Overall, the company's financials show a positive sign of improvement as regards its operational metrics and a more sustainable cost structure. These are some of the reasons why it is still worth holding.

Some of the trends I've noticed in the company's performance is firstly, the lack of interest in diversifying beyond its overreliance on a particular segment - e-commerce. While this has probably helped it build its leadership status in the industry, I strongly believe it could achieve more if it steps out of its comfort zone.

Further on a macroeconomic level, the devaluation of the Nigerian Naira has been a major issue for the country, with its Apex Bank (the Central Bank of Nigeria - CBN) working round the clock to address. Issues the CBN highlighted and aims to address is the speculative holding of the US dollar and other foreign currencies in anticipation of a wider increase in their value and consequently a decrease in the value of the Naira, heightened interest in Cryptocurrencies, heavy reliance on imports leading to trade deficits, increased demand for foreign currencies, Inflation, etc, combined with its Debt Servicing Costs creates a multifaceted economic issue. My assertion is that at this point Jumia can only react to it, take decisions to safeguard itself, apart from these it cannot really do anything about it.

Opportunities

Within the past couple of months earlier in 2024, the Nigerian Naira witnessed an impressive surge in value, becoming the best performing currency during the time frame of a couple months. If such an event repeats itself, and the economy of the nation stabilizes in such a state, the story would be totally different as Jumia would not only automatically be on an incredibly profitable side, but its e-commerce engagements as well as other segments would primarily benefit in no small way. This would also make me change my rating to a buy.

Also, a move to make other segments independent would in my opinion be a positive game changer for the stock as its performance won't be tied to a certain segment.

Further, its status topping the leaderboard of the e-commerce space in Africa would set it up for benefits should the industry on the continent witness a positive increase.

Risks

The economy of its major market could further deteriorate, while I don't see this happening as it seems to have stabilized. I acknowledge that it is still a very valid risk. Further, any major issues with its e-commerce platform would adversely affect other segments seeing they are so closely attached.

I failed to carry out a comparison to other pairs in the e-commerce space in Nigeria, because of its market share and the fact that none of its competitors are listed in a US stock exchange, I felt no proper comparison is available. JUMIA is uniquely in a class of its own. Also, the analysis so far is majorly based on its highest grossing segment by revenue - e-commerce, plus I believe it is important to note that other segments: payment services and logistics is riding on its e-commerce business, outside of its e-commerce platform, the other segments are negligible as they don't stand on their own in any significant way, thus, the success or failure of the e-commerce business would tell on every other segments.

Concluding thoughts

The economic issues in Nigeria, though valid as an excuse for underperformance, would buttress why I believe a company's operation should not be too overweight on an economy, particularly on one popularly regarded as volatile.

Seeing that JMIA’s issues are mostly macro-economic, thus majorly out of its control. It could only react to or at best be proactive to stay afloat.

My rating on JMIA is HOLD, it seems to be taking some major steps which in my opinion is in the right direction. Its YTD and 1 year stock review shows a positive uptrend further, it is fixated on the right things.

Although I'm not too impressed that it didn't highlight a decision and steps to rapidly and aggressively expand operations especially out of its major stronghold- Nigeria. Now, I believe Nigeria, one of Africa’s largest economies is still a plus for the company, after all it has a population of active internet users which is significantly more than the entire population of other African nations. Saying this, I also believe that worthy of note is that a major positive increase in the Nation's currency and economy would instantly skyrocket Jumia's revenue and growth. I assert also, that working on the independence of its payment service and logistics businesses would be very helpful for its stability moving forward.

However, further outlook not just at Jumia but the nation's economy is essential to make investment decisions moving forward with a potential to change my current rating.","Having an e-commerce platform with only 24 million active customers- on rough estimate is still quite low for an e-commerce platform.

Investment Thesis

Amazon's (NASDAQ:AMZN) stock reached its all-time high last week, buoyed by its AI growth optimism. In my previous analysis, I upgraded the stock from hold to buy in August 2023, driven by a cheap valuation and potential rebound in retail sales and cost management. Since then, the stock has surged 37%, beating S&P 500 index's 21.5%. However, given the recent expansion in valuation multiples, I believe this AI hype is a bit premature. The company's primary growth driver is still its retail business. While the recent increase in capital investments in AWS infrastructures will boost its long-term growth trajectory for its cloud segment, I do not believe AWS can significantly move the needle to improve its top-line growth in the near term.

The over 200% YoY improvement in earnings last year was not largely driven by revenue growth, but by operating efficiency due to massive layoffs and cuts in marketing spending. Therefore, I downgrade the stock to hold from buy as the current risk-reward is getting less attractive, especially given the potential cyclical weakness in consumer spending, which could create headwinds for its retail and advertising business.

Still More Than 80% Revenue Comes from Retails

The company model

Many people are discussing how GenAI will improve the growth trajectory of AWS and its advertising business. According to Bloomberg article, AMZN reached a $2 trillion market cap last week, largely due to its AI optimism. However, we have yet to see a strong growth rebound in its total revenue yet. We know that AMZN's net retail sales (82.5% of its total revenue) remain on a low teens growth trajectory. Particularly, its Online Stores sales maintain high single-digit growth. The company is strategically prioritizing high-growth cloud business related to AI technology, as the revenue mix from online stores decreased from 49% in Q1 FY2021 to 38.1% in Q1 FY2024. Meanwhile, AWS's revenue mix has increased, reaching nearly 20% of its total revenue in the last quarter. Despite this shift, the company still largely relies on retail sales to maintain its growth trajectory. As shown in the chart above, total retail sales growth has reaccelerated since Q1 FY2023, supporting my previous bullish view on the stock over the past months.

Although 1Q FY2024 total revenue topped estimates, the growth rate experienced a mild QoQ slowdown. Additionally, the company is expected to see a continued QoQ slowdown in 2Q FY2024, based on its 7% to 11% growth outlook, which is below the market consensus. Management in the earnings call attributed this to a roughly 60 bps headwind from FX impact. Therefore, we may see retail sales growth slow in the next earnings result compared to Q2 FY2023, justifying my cautious view after the stock reached its all-time high.

Earnings Growth Driven by Layoffs and Marketing Cuts

The company model

The company's bottom line has significantly improved over the past quarters. Let's focus on the green columns in the chart, we see that similar margin levels in Q1 FY2021 and Q1 FY2024. I believe that the key difference between these two periods is that the high EBITDA margin in Q1 FY2021 was driven by strong revenue growth, while the margin in Q1 FY2024 was due to reduced operating expenses.

We saw that AMZN's total revenue growth in 1Q FY2021 was 45.7% YoY, whereas in 1Q FY2024, it was only 11.6% YoY. I think that achieving strong earnings growth by cutting General and Administrative and Marketing expenses is unsustainable in the long term. The negative YoY growth trend in these expenses since Q3 FY2023, as shown by the blue and red lines above, further supports this.

According to another Bloomberg article, AMZN is cutting hundreds of jobs including 27,000 corporate roles, as part of a cost management plan following a pandemic-era hiring boom. Therefore, I'm skeptical that a further stock rally from here will be largely driven by cost cuttings. The management also implied an 8.2% GAAP EBIT margin in Q2 FY2024, below the 10.7% seen in Q1 FY2024. However, could AI boom structurally shape the company's overall growth outlook? Let's check out its AI cloud business.

Growth Drivers: AWS and Advertising Business

The company model

AWS's revenue mix has steadily expanded over the past years, from 12.4% of total revenue in Q1 FY2021 to 17.5% in Q1 FY2024. However, significant growth rebound due to the current AI frenzy has yet to be seen. Nonetheless, it's encouraging to see AWS's GAAP EBIT margin reach an all-time high of 37.6%. While job cuts in the Cloud computing division may have contributed to this improvement, management explained that it was primarily due to managing infrastructure and fixed costs.

Meanwhile, advertising revenue continues to maintain over 20% YoY growth in the last quarter. The management attributed this strength to sponsored products and ongoing improvements in relevancy and measurement capabilities for advertisers. However, the advertising business segment currently accounts for only 7.5% of total revenue, which is not very significant.

Significant Capital Investments in FY2024

The company model

During the earnings call, management indicated a meaningful increase in capital expenditures on a year-over-year basis in FY2024, primarily driven by higher infrastructure capex to support growth in AWS, including generative AI. They define capital investments as the combination of capex plus equipment finance leases. Looking at the chart above, we notice that this ratio is below the past three-year average but has started to tick up in 1Q FY2024. I believe AMZN is making the right move by increasing capital investments to support AWS infrastructure, particularly in generative AI efforts. Unlike other software companies like Microsoft (MSFT), AWS takes time to become a key driver of boosting its top-line revenue growth.

Valuation

Seeking Alpha

I upgraded the stock to buy in August 2023 as AMZN's valuation multiple was cheap amidst a potential growth rebound in its core retail business. The stock is currently trading at 3.5x EV/Sales TTM, which is nearly in-line with its 5-year average of 3.46x. Meanwhile, according to Seeking Alpha consensus, AMZN is expected to generate non-GAAP EPS of $5.74, which implies 33.6x non-GAAP P/E FY2024. This multiple is also in-line with Nasdaq 100 index. Therefore, I think the stock is not trading at a lofty valuation and currently fairly valued.

Conclusion

In conclusion, while AMZN's stock soared to an all-time high fueled by market optimism around its AI cloud business, the company's primary growth driver remains its retail sales. Despite the strong growth potential of AWS, the segment has yet to contribute significantly to its top-line growth. Moreover, the recent earnings improvement has been largely due to cost-cutting measures rather than revenue growth, raising concerns about sustainability. With potential cyclical weaknesses in consumer spending and a moderate growth outlook, the current valuation appears in-line with my expectation. Consequently, I am downgrading the stock from buy to hold, given the less attractive risk-reward profile at this moment.","The over 200% YoY improvement in earnings last year was not largely driven by revenue growth, but by operating efficiency due to massive layoffs and cuts in marketing spending.

Investment thesis

Archer Aviation (NYSE:ACHR) is a company in a fast growing urban air mobility sector that is highly competitive, and it involves electric vertical take-off and landing (eVTOL) planes. According to Mckinsey’s forecast, the industry is expected to grow at a CAGR of over 50% until 2035. A 50% market growth each year indicates that the company is still in its infancy. However, from my analysis, Archer is uniquely positioned in terms of design and development strategy that allows them to move as a commercial first-mover. I believe that it is a strong competitor in the industry with huge potential upside. Therefore, the company is assigned with a Buy rating.

Competitions are intense but Archer has got its differentiation

In reality, the regulatory framework for urban air mobility is still evolving, with rules and standards adapting to technological advancements. Attaining certification from aviation authorities like the FAA is still a big barrier because it requires rigorous testing for safety and dependability, especially when there are exponentially increasing market participants which make regulations necessary. However, the industry may be young but there are many companies competing intensely for supremacy as they strive to become pacesetters of this innovative means of transport.

eVTOL News

The main competitors include names like Joby Aviation (NYSE:JOBY), Vertical Aerospace (NYSE:EVTL), Lilium (NASDAQ:LILM), EHang (NASDAQ:EH) and Wisk Aero. In the eVTOL industry, Joby has been dominant for its sophisticated aircraft design as well as high levels of funding. Vertical Aerospace is a UK-based firm which emphasizes safety, efficiency and sustainability in designing the eVTOL aircraft. Germany’s Lilium offers a unique jet-powered design that allows it to cover longer distances. There are also strong competitors from China like EHang, as I covered in previous analysis, alongside others internationally.

To highlight, Archer Aviation has some main important differences between it and Joby's eVTOL designs. With regard to control redundancy Archer’s 12-motor configuration is superior while Joby’s six-motor architecture may be more efficient in terms of lighter hardware weight and simplicity. In case of certification by Joby, there might be an advantage in terms of efficiency but easier control can be claimed for Archer’s design thus contributing to extra safety features.

MIT Technology Roadmapping

The 12-engine model of Archer is also different from Vertical Aerospace which highlights safety and efficiency. In contrast, Lilium stands out in its jet-powered design that covers greater distances and EHang of China leads in autonomous aerial vehicles with several models already flying. In addition, Wisk Aero, a joint venture between Boeing and Kitty Hawk also places great importance on self-flying. Although each firm has unique strengths to the new urban air mobility market, all fight for control of this transformative business space. The road ahead is tough, but transforming urban transportations has weighty stakes ahead for those who can negotiate these early days successfully. Archer seems to have a unique strategy focusing on safety and efficiency, in the face of regulators’ concerns and the concerns around energy usage.

Progress in prototype but still a lot to prove

Archer Aviation’s prototyping and certification has progressed significantly, showing promising eVTOL technology and commercialization advancements. However, the company still has much to prove as it moves forward.

The next steps include rigorous testing, securing FAA certification, and refining its production processes. Archer must demonstrate the reliability, safety, and efficiency of its aircraft to meet regulatory standards and market expectations while remaining keen on its commercial launch timing and operational readiness.

It is true that Archer is on its second prototype while Joby is on its fifth but this only comes down to differences in strategy. Joby Aviation adopts a strategy of rapid iteration by trying out many configurations and learning from each one. Conversely, Archer Aviation takes the more conventional approach to aircraft manufacturing in which there is an extensive concept phase at the outset, followed by preliminary and critical design reviews. That systematic process, as was employed in developing Boeing 787 and Airbus A380, involves few configurations and iterations but ultimately produces a finely-tuned final prototype. In that distinction lies Archer’s dedication to intricate planning and design accuracy within the emerging eVTOL marketplace.

The next major steps for Archer Aviation are extensive flight tests that build confidence in safety and reliability, necessary for FAA certification. The plan is to carry out such tests most intensely over the coming months as Archer moves from controlled environments into more complex flight scenarios. Gaining FAA certification means that commercial operations can start at Archer. Also, it has formed a partnership with Stellantis to improve its production capabilities aiming to produce at scale.

Looking ahead, Archer will launch its first commercial flights by 2025 and this will include establishing urban air mobility routes, initially in collaboration with United Airlines, to integrate eVTOL services into existing transportation networks. Each phase is designed to build confidence in their technology, ensuring a smooth transition from prototype to practical urban air mobility solutions.

Valuation

Based on our valuation analysis using the “Boom and Doom model”, which incorporates the probability-weighted valuation of the best and worst case scenarios, we arrive at a valuation of $5.89 for Archer Aviation. This represents an over 60% upside compared to its current price.

Image created by the author

Our model reflects our expectation of the company’s growth in revenue starting in 2025, and reaching $284 million in 2026 in the boom case scenario. This is an optimistic yet realistic expectation since the management expects revenue to come in by 2024, and commercial operations of the air taxis start in late 2025. On the other hand, we expect the company to shrink its operating expenses as commercial operations start to ramp and research expenses to drop gradually. In the last quarter, the company’s recurring quarterly operating expenses was at around $60 million. With about $400 million cash, the company is not facing any imminent needs to raise additional money and is expected to maintain its debt level as factored in our model.

Data by YCharts

The valuation reflects a 65% probability assigned to the boom scenario and a 35% probability to the doom scenario, as we think that the trajectories of the company’s prototyping, certification and design are all pointing to the successful launch direction. In the boom case, we apply a 9.5x EV/Revenue multiple for 2026, which is a more realistic multiple compared to the current ratio in the industry, such as Joby’s 1000x EV/Revenue.

Investment risks

Regulatory risks: As mentioned, in a novel and disruptive industry, there is significant uncertainty around Archer's ability to get certified within its plan. The certification standard and requirements are ever-changing, any major delay and changes could seriously affect the company’s commercial plan and design

Technology risks: eVTOL as a new mode of transport has a lot to prove and a lot of technology constraints to overcome. The commercial-ready products need to meet its safety, performance, battery life and cost requirements. Issues can arise anytime during the design, testing and other phases.

Competition: There is no obvious winner currently in the industry, but competition from worldwide is intense. If these other companies progress faster than Archer in testing and certification, they could capture most of the market share and leaving Archer behind.

Conclusion

Archer Aviation's progress to date has presented an optimistic picture about its prospect. With its unique aircraft design focusing on safety and also its development strategy, Archer is well-positioned to be a leader in the massive and rapidly growing eVTOL market. Although there is uncertainty, Archer's potential and probability of success lead to a Buy rating from me.","In the eVTOL industry, Joby has been dominant for its sophisticated aircraft design as well as high levels of funding.

Introduction

Everyone knows Ferrari (NYSE:RACE) either as a company that makes ultra-luxury cars or as the best team in the history of F1. However, what would you think if I told you that one aspect feeds the other, and vice versa, resulting in one of the best companies in the world?

Since its IPO, Ferrari has delivered a spectacular 31% annual compounded return. Such a performance over so many years cannot be attributed to mere chance. In this article, we will uncover the secrets that make Ferrari an extraordinary company, despite operating in an industry as challenging as the automotive sector when it comes to generating shareholder value.

We will delve deeper into this throughout the article, but the summary of this investment thesis is that, by investing in Ferrari, we are not really investing in automobiles but in luxury. This detail may seem trivial, but from my point of view, it completely changes the approach we should take as investors when considering this company.

The History of Ferrari

I don't usually spend much time researching the distant past of the companies I analyze, but in this case, I believe it is crucial. So, let's take a brief look at the history of the 'prancing horse'.

The history of Ferrari begins with Enzo Ferrari, born in 1898 in Modena, Italy. From a young age, he showed a great interest in motorsports, influenced by his father and older brother, who also shared this passion. In the 1920s, Enzo began his career as a race car driver, competing for the Alfa Romeo team. His passion for racing led him to found Scuderia Ferrari in 1929, initially as a racing team for Alfa Romeo. For more than a decade, Scuderia Ferrari was responsible for managing and preparing race cars for Alfa Romeo. However, Enzo had a more ambitious dream: to build his own cars.

Enzo Ferrari (Ferrari Investor Relations)

In 1939, Enzo Ferrari left Alfa Romeo to establish Auto Avio Costruzioni. Due to a clause in his contract, he could not use the Ferrari name on his cars for the first few years. During World War II, the company focused on producing tools and mechanical equipment. After the war, in 1947, Enzo was finally able to realize his dream and introduced the first car under the Ferrari brand, the 125 S.

The following years witnessed the consolidation of Ferrari in the world of racing and luxury car production. However, it was in Formula 1 where Ferrari would achieve unprecedented success. In 1950, Scuderia Ferrari made its debut in the Formula 1 World Championship, and in 1952, Alberto Ascari won the first drivers' championship for Ferrari. The 1960s and 1970s brought more championships and glory. Legendary drivers like Juan Manuel Fangio and Niki Lauda contributed to the team's rich history. In the following years, Ferrari cemented its name as the greatest racing team in history, with drivers like Michael Schumacher, Fernando Alonso, and Sebastian Vettel behind the wheel.

In 1969, facing financial challenges, Enzo Ferrari decided to sell a majority stake in his company to Fiat S.p.A., thus ensuring the stability and future of Ferrari. This alliance allowed Ferrari to benefit from Fiat's resources and infrastructure while continuing its dominance on the racetracks and its production of luxury cars. However, in 2015, Fiat decided to spin off Ferrari, and it went public as an independent entity.

Today, Ferrari has millions of fans around the world, thanks to its numerous successes in racing. These triumphs in competitions have allowed the brand to launch high-end car models for the general public, becoming the company's main business.

The relationship between racing and road cars has been crucial for Ferrari, not only for technology and innovation but also because the prestige and mystique of the brand are nourished by its legacy on the tracks. Each victory and championship won reinforces Ferrari's image as a symbol of luxury, performance, and exclusivity. This combination of racing heritage and engineering excellence has positioned Ferrari as one of the most exclusive and desired car manufacturers in the world. Each model not only represents luxury and prestige, but also the passion and competitive spirit that have characterized the brand since its inception.

Business Model

Luxury cars

The main part of Ferrari's business and the focus of this analysis is the sale of luxury vehicles, as it constitutes more than 80% of Ferrari's business. This is where the story we just told about Ferrari comes into play, as the brand has an aura that is practically irreplicable by other luxury car manufacturers, thanks to its history of success in motorsport. There may be other brands that produce exclusive luxury cars that match Ferrari's performance, but none will be able to replicate the brand's aura. This is what makes Ferrari truly irreplicable.

In addition to this, the company skillfully plays with the exclusivity of its vehicles to generate scarcity, thereby increasing the desire for the brand. In fact, when the company was once asked how many vehicles it would manufacture, the response was brilliant: ""We will always manufacture at least one car fewer than the market demands.""

While premium vehicle companies such as BMW or Mercedes-Benz sell more than 2 million cars a year, and even more premium brands sometimes considered luxury like Porsche sell over 300,000 vehicles a year, Ferrari in 2023 sold around 13,000 units. While these three German brands and many others considered premium, sell as many units as they can at the highest price they can, Ferrari sells the number of cars it wants, artificially limiting the supply.

Ferrari 2023 10K

Some might think that it makes no sense for Ferrari to limit the supply when it could sell more cars, as this means the results are not as high as they could be, and you would be absolutely right. However, this strategy significantly increases the terminal value of the company and extends its growth as much as possible over time. Consider that the demand for Ferrari is much higher than its limited supply, making it very easy for them to grow the number of vehicles sold each year or systematically increase prices, which users will accept. As investors, this is fantastic because we have very high visibility of the cash flows the company will generate in the long term and very little uncertainty.

Besides the aura that the Ferrari brand has due to its racing history, the company uses a series of mechanisms to further increase the desire and exclusivity of the brand. For example, they will never sell you a car if you go directly to the Ferrari dealership to buy it; they intentionally make you wait on a waiting list so that you value the product more. Additionally, the brand does not allow modifications to their cars that are not certified by them. If you do so, they remove you from their client list, and you will never be able to buy another car from the brand again. This news about Justin Bieber is a good example of this policy.

They also play a very interesting strategy to keep customers loyal to the brand. When you buy a Ferrari for the first time, they let you access their standard models. However, if you want to access one of the limited editions that they release from time to time, you must have bought a vehicle from the brand before; otherwise, you will not be able to access it. Considering that their target market is multimillionaires with a lot of money, securing them as recurring customers is very valuable for the company in the long run.

Engines

On the other hand, Ferrari sells some of the engines it designs to other manufacturers for both street cars and competition vehicles. For example, Ferrari supplies the engines for the Haas and Alfa Romeo Formula 1 teams and sells street car engines to Maserati and Alfa Romeo, among others. This part represents a very small percentage of their revenue, but I believe it is a good way to leverage the work and resources put into engine manufacturing, generating extra sales.

Sponsors, merchandising and others

Lastly, Ferrari also generates revenue from the sale of merchandise such as caps, sunglasses, and clothing related to F1. They also operate theme parks and engage in other minor activities. Additionally, their strong racing image attracts many advertisers who want to place their logos on Ferrari cars. For instance, Celsius has signed an agreement with them, and HP is set to pay over $70 million annually to be the team's official sponsor.

Financials

All these fundamentals have translated into extraordinary numbers. Since its IPO in 2016, Ferrari has grown its sales by 11%, with a dip in 2020 for obvious reasons, but with an extraordinary recovery in the following years. This increase, as you can see, has been quite linear, which is remarkably noteworthy in a cyclical market like the automotive industry. This is precisely the investment thesis in Ferrari: they are not a traditional car company; they are a company that sells luxury in the form of cars and is completely unaffected by the typical cycles that impact the industry.

Koyfin

This growth has also translated into spectacular growth in the bottom line. Both the Free Cash Flow (FCF) and net earnings per share have compounded at over 20% annually. This has obviously been due to a significant margin expansion driven by the pricing power we have been discussing and thanks to their vertical integration, which gives them great control over the supply chain. The operational leverage has been more than evident, and although from my point of view, I highly doubt that margins can continue to grow at this pace, I do believe they can keep expanding until they achieve at least a 30% operating margin and a 25% net margin.

I believe the graph that best represents everything we've been discussing is the following. Here we can see the returns on invested capital for different companies in the automotive sector. We see how traditional car companies rarely exceed 10%, while Ferrari comfortably surpasses 20%. Again, this is because Ferrari is more of a luxury company than a car company, with total control over supply, allowing them to generate much more value for their shareholders than the rest of the companies in the automotive sector.

Risks

In my long-term thesis, I see only two real risks that could affect Ferrari's performance: one internal and the other external.

Execution Risk: As I have tried to convey throughout this article, the most important aspect of Ferrari is its brand image. If its image were to deteriorate and Ferrari were no longer considered a luxury company but just another premium car manufacturer, the terminal value would obviously decrease, and the valuation multiples would contract significantly. For example, a very large increase in the number of vehicles sold per year could dilute the brand's exclusivity. If you see a couple of Ferraris every day on the street, you would obviously lose that sense of exclusivity with the brand. I don't think this is very likely to happen since the management itself is aware of this and always focuses on preserving the brand's value, but it is something we, as shareholders, must monitor.

Regulatory Risk: On the other hand, regulatory risk could pose a clear threat to Ferrari, especially with electric vehicles. Some governments, such as those in Europe or California, are considering regulations to ban internal combustion vehicles by 2035 or similar dates. Ferrari would have to transition to electric vehicles, which I find challenging because the gasoline engine with its characteristic noise is something that greatly attracts people to the brand, and without it, they might lose the interest of some buyers. While there are reports of possible laws allowing supercars to continue running on gasoline, this is an issue that could affect Ferrari and is currently surrounded by considerable uncertainty for the coming years.

Valuation and conclusions

If we want to reach a realistic target value for Ferrari, I think we need to consider its extremely high terminal value, as we have discussed. From my point of view, it wouldn't make sense to apply a terminal value of 2% in its valuation, given their control over supply and the fact that the demand for their vehicles far exceeds this. Ferrari will be able to continue growing its sales above 5% after year 10 with almost total certainty, so it is very important to reflect this in its valuation.

Even so, being quite optimistic and estimating a 12% growth in FCF until year 10, applying a perpetual growth of 5% and a WACC of 9.5%, the current valuation of €370 does not seem very attractive to me for buying Ferrari. A price around €300 per share would seem like a much better entry if we want to add Ferrari to the portfolio.

Author's calculations

Anyway, as I often repeat in many of my analyses, I don't think it's a good decision to sell this type of high-quality company just because we might be in a temporary overvaluation. These companies have shown that they always tend to beat estimates and grow beyond expectations, so I am going to assign a 'Hold' rating to Ferrari shares.

In summary, I believe the key to analyzing Ferrari is to realize that it is not just another car company, and it doesn't make sense to analyze it with the same metrics and models as other manufacturers. Ferrari is a luxury company with everything that entails. If we take this into account, the multiples at which it trades don't seem so outrageous, and we can achieve returns above the market average, even buying at valuations that would be unthinkable for other vehicle manufacturers.","The history of Ferrari begins with Enzo Ferrari, born in 1898 in Modena, Italy.
His passion for racing led him to found Scuderia Ferrari in 1929, initially as a racing team for Alfa Romeo.
Enzo Ferrari (Ferrari Investor Relations)In 1939, Enzo Ferrari left Alfa Romeo to establish Auto Avio Costruzioni.
There may be other brands that produce exclusive luxury cars that match Ferrari's performance, but none will be able to replicate the brand's aura.
Additionally, their strong racing image attracts many advertisers who want to place their logos on Ferrari cars.","['history', 'success', 'brand', 'racing', 'ferrari', 'growth', 'nyserace', 'car',

Thesis

YieldMax Universe Fund of Option Income ETFs (NYSEARCA:YMAX) is an exchange-traded fund. The fund falls in the ""fund of funds"" category, meaning that it will primarily invest its assets in other YieldMax ETFs. The appeal for this name lies in the eye-popping 44% distribution rate, which is real, and we are going to fully analyze it in our article.

In this piece, we are going to walk readers through YMAX's composition, its risks and rewards, and highlight why an investor ultimately takes a long position in a handful of popular large capitalization stocks via this ETF.

ETF composition - the YieldMax fund family

The fund is an aggregator, meaning it contains a list of other ETFs from the YieldMax fund family:

Holdings (Fund Website)

We can see how the name contains the AMD YMax ETF, the COIN YMax ETF and the Meta YMax fund. Let us take a detailed look through one of these names so that we can get a better sense for what they do, and how they fit in the picture.

However, before we do that, please note the weightings for each name within the YMAX context - each underlying fund has a roughly 5% weighting, meaning the YMAX fund contains 20 individual names which are equally weighted in the fund.

Let us have a closer look at the COIN ETF as an example:

YieldMax COIN Option Income Strategy ETF (CONY) is an exchange traded fund which uses options to build a synthetic long position in Coinbase (COIN), with a capped upside profile but a downside resembling the stock:

The Fund’s strategy will cap its potential gains if COIN shares increase in value. The Fund’s strategy is subject to all potential losses if COIN shares decrease in value, which may not be offset by income received by the Fund. The Fund may not be suitable for all investors.

The option strategy ensures a high distribution rate and has matched COIN's total return profile in 2024:

YTD Performance (Seeking Alpha)

For any options-based ETF, it is important to ensure an investor runs a 'total return' when comparing performance. CONY and COIN have had similar total returns in 2024 given COIN's moves, but CONY lags on a 1-year basis given the substantial move in COIN:

1-year Total Return (Seeking Alpha)

The more substantial the upswing in an underlying stock, the larger the lag exhibited by the YieldMax funds.

The distribution is real

An investor can find the YMAX distribution rate on the fund's main page:

Distribution Rate (Fund Website)

This distribution is real, and we can quickly do a spot check. If we go on the Seeking Alpha platform under the Dividends tab under Dividend History, we can see the fund paying a monthly dividend of 0.73 as of June 2024. If we annualize it (0.73 x 12) and divide it by the stock price of 19.5/share, we get the 44% distribution rate.

Mind you that YMAX simply passes down to investors the distribution it gets from the underlying 20 ETFs in its composition. The YieldMax fund family aims to extract dividends from large popular stocks via options strategies. The dividend only exists as long as the underlying stocks appreciate in value.

Once the underlying stocks stagnate or go down in price, the distribution rate will move down as well. A retail investor needs to understand that while the distribution rate is real, it will change downwards if the underlying stocks underperform. This is not a fixed 44% that you will get in perpetuity, and it simply reflects the current upward momentum in certain underlying stocks.

Comparing YMAX to its components

We have already established the YMAX needs to be looked at from a total return perspective:

Data by YCharts

The fund is up over 22% from a total return perspective in 2024. Let us look at how its components have fared:

Portfolio of Names (Author)

What we did is extract the year to date performance on a price basis for each underlying stock in the YMAX portfolio. So for COIN for example, when looking at the underlying stock we can see it is up 27% in 2024:

Data by YCharts

We did the same exercise for each name in the portfolio, then proceeded to weight each one by the 5% weighting in the underlying ETF. The general idea is to see what the difference would be between holding YMAX and just holding outright each underlying stock with a 5% weighting.

The end result for the outright long portfolio is 24.2%, versus a 22.8% return for YMAX. The ETF has therefore done a very good job in converting the underlying portfolio returns into a high monthly dividend yield. In essence, via YMAX, a retail investor is holding the above equity portfolio, but YMAX does the dividend extraction automatically every month via its structure. An investor outright the stocks would be up 24.2%, but they would need to sell a portion of each name in order to realize the respective capital gain for the year.

Risk factors

A retail investors need to understand that YMAX is not a fixed income ETF. The distribution rate is purely based on the volatility and appreciation of the underlying equities. If the stock market tanks, YMAX will move down as well, as so will its distribution rate. The downside profile for YMAX is comparable with holding the underlying 20 stocks outright.

A hard landing or prolonged recessionary period can cause havoc for many underlying stocks in the portfolio, and we should look no further than Coinbase:

Data by YCharts

The COIN equity experienced a -80% draw in 2022, and represents a high beta play in the equity market.

Conclusion

YMAX is an exchange-traded fund. The vehicle acts as an aggregator, or 'fund of funds', containing 20 individual names from the YieldMax family with a rough 5% individual weighting. The best way to think of YMAX is as a means of extracting high distributions from its underlying names via options strategies. YMAX has a total return profile which is similar to holding the names outright with a 5% weighting, return profile which will lag if the underlying names move up exponentially. The downside profile is equivalent among the two. The 44% distribution for the name is real, but dynamic. If the underlying names lose value, the distribution will go down, as well as the fund NAV and price. YMAX is up over 22% in 2024, and will continue to generate high returns as long as the popular large capitalization names in its portfolio continue to appreciate in value.","The appeal for this name lies in the eye-popping 44% distribution rate, which is real, and we are going to fully analyze it in our article.

In buying Spirit, Boeing hopes to stem quality problems that have plagued the supplier in recent years. While it already has significant influence over Spirit, Boeing will more easily be able to monitor and change production practices by owning the business. Boeing has taken internal steps to improve quality, too, after a harrowing incident in which a panel blew out of one of its planes on a flight in January.

“By reintegrating Spirit,” Boeing’s chief executive, Dave Calhoun, said in a statement, the company “can fully align” its production and safety systems with its work force.

The deal, which was widely expected, was valued at $4.7 billion in stock or $8.3 billion including Spirit’s debt. It is subject to approval by regulators and Spirit’s shareholders. Boeing will also spin off portions of Spirit to Airbus, its European rival, as part of the transaction. Boeing said it expected its acquisition of Spirit to close by the middle of next year.","Boeing said on Monday that it had agreed to buy a major supplier, Spirit AeroSystems, ending a nearly two-decade experiment in outsourcing production of major components of its commercial planes, including the body of the 737 Max and parts of the 767, 777 and 787.

A conference room also serves as a venue for “shots nights,” less raucous than they sound, where patients inject themselves with fertility drugs communally, with encouragement from staff.

Spring’s medical director in New York, Catha Fischer, dressed in a loose blouse and a low ponytail, beamed as she showed me the phlebotomy stations and operating room, where patients are anesthetized so that a doctor can puncture their ovaries with a needle and suck out eggs for freezing. The room, Dr. Fischer noted, “looks like a Grey’s Anatomy O.R.”

A federal grand jury on Thursday indicted Hoau-Yan Wang, a professor at the City College of New York, on charges of falsifying data to obtain grants totaling roughly $16 million from the National Institutes of Health.

Dr. Wang’s studies underpinned research into a diagnostic test for Alzheimer’s disease and simufilam, a drug in advanced clinical trials. Simufilam’s manufacturer, Cassava Sciences, a pharmaceutical company based in Texas, has said the drug improves cognition in Alzheimer’s patients.

Yahoo Finance,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/charlie-munger-said-warren-buffett-154854452.html,2024-07-01,15:48:54 UTC,Charlie Munger Said He And Warren Buffett Always Self-Insure — You Should Too If You Can Afford It: 'Don't Pay For The Other Fellow's Fraud',"Just months before his passing at the ripe old age of 99, Charlie Munger, the ever-sharp vice chairman of Berkshire Hathaway, shared some valuable insights with the public.

During the 2023 Daily Journal shareholder meeting, Munger responded to a question from CNBC's Becky Quick about the trend of large companies, including Meta, opting for self-insurance against various liabilities. Quickly inquired about the potential systemic issues this trend could cause and sought Munger's thoughts.

Don't Miss:

Are you rich? Here’s what Americans think you need to be considered wealthy.

Warren Buffett once said, ""If you don't find a way to make money while you sleep, you will work until you die."" Here's how you can collect passive rental income without being a landlord.

Known for his straightforward approach, Munger shared his personal philosophy on self-insurance. He said, ""In my own life, I'm a big self-insurer and so is Warren. It's ridiculous to carry fire insurance on my houses because I can so easily rebuild a house that would burn down. So why would I want to bother fooling around with the claims process and all kinds of things?""

He emphasized the practicality of self-insuring for those who can afford it, noting, ""If insurance, you should insure against things you can't afford to pay for yourself. But if you can afford to take the bumps, you know, some unusual expense coming along doesn't really hurt you that much. Why would you want to fool around with some insurance company? If your house burned down, I would just write a check and rebuild it.""

Munger argued that all intelligent people are self-insured. He then clarified, maybe not ""all,"" but said, ""All intelligent people should do it my way,"" highlighting the waste and fraud often associated with traditional insurance. ""There should be way more self-insurance in life. There's a lot of waste you're paying when you buy insurance for the other fellow's frauds, and there's a lot of fraud in life."" He explained that if you can afford to take the risk yourself, you should, but there is a risk involved.

It may be easy for a Munger to rebuild a home, considering his net worth was $2.6 billion during the interview. However, for the average person, this would be an extreme hardship. There is also the liability factor involved if something were to occur on your property, causing injury to another.

Trending: Elon Musk and Jeff Bezos are bullish on one city that could dethrone New York and become the new financial capital of the US. Investing in its booming real estate market has never been more accessible.

Berkshire Hathaway, the conglomerate where Munger served as vice chairman, has substantial interests in the insurance industry. The company owns several major insurance subsidiaries, including GEICO, Berkshire Hathaway Reinsurance Group, and Berkshire Hathaway Primary Group. These insurance operations have been a core part of Berkshire Hathaway's financial success, making Munger's advice particularly notable given the company's deep involvement in the sector.

Story continues

Despite his role at Berkshire Hathaway, a company deeply invested in the insurance industry, Munger maintained his candid stance. ""I'd rather tell it the way it is and tell it in a way that helps Berkshire. I'm not going to tell it differently than I think it really is just because it's better for Berkshire. Even though it's bad for Berkshire, I want to tell you, if you can afford to self-insure, self-insure.""

Munger's advice comes when a growing number of American homeowners opt to go without insurance, not because they can afford to self-insure like Munger, but due to rising costs. A recent study by the Insurance Information Institute found that 12% of Americans no longer have home insurance, up from 5% in 2019. This surge in uninsured homeowners is the highest the industry has seen, driven by the rising coverage costs.

Self-insurance may offer savings and simplicity, but it carries significant risks. For many, it might not be a viable option without a thorough understanding of their financial situation. Consulting a financial advisor can help assess whether self-insurance is feasible and advisable.

Yahoo Finance,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/ballmer-richer-gates-first-microsoft-203825410.html,2024-07-01,20:38:25 UTC,"Ballmer Is Richer Than Gates, a First for Microsoft Billionaires","(Bloomberg) — Steve Ballmer passed Bill Gates on Monday to become the sixth-richest person in the world, the first time the former chief executive officer of Microsoft Corp. has been wealthier than the company’s co-founder.

Most Read from Bloomberg

The move came as Microsoft shares rose to a fresh record, bringing their total gain this year to 21%. The company, through its partnership with OpenAI, has been one of the biggest beneficiaries of the artificial intelligence rally that has powered the US stock market higher.

More than 90% of Ballmer’s $157.2 billion net worth is in Microsoft shares, according to the Bloomberg Billionaires Index. Gates, meanwhile, has diversified his $156.7 billion fortune: About half his wealth is held through Cascade Investment, which was created with the proceeds of Microsoft stock sales and dividends. He also owns a $21 billion stake in waste-management company Republic Services Inc. through Cascade.

Gates, 68, has been slowly reducing his fortune through philanthropy. Along with his ex-wife Melinda French Gates and his friend Warren Buffett, Gates has funneled billions of dollars of his personal money to build up the $75 billion Gates Foundation, one of the biggest charitable organizations in the world.

Since they started the foundation more than two decades ago, Gates and his former wife have given almost $60 billion from their personal fortunes. French Gates recently stepped down as co-chair of the foundation and received $12.5 billion to use for her own charitable purposes.

In 2010, Gates, French Gates and Buffett also founded the Giving Pledge, an organization that encourages the world’s richest people to give away the majority of their fortunes in their lifetimes or their wills. Ballmer, 68, who has not signed the Giving Pledge, has his own philanthropic work but nowhere on the scale of Gates.

Gates founded Microsoft with his friend Paul Allen in 1975 and led it until 2000, when Ballmer — one of the company’s earliest employees — replaced him as CEO. Ballmer retired in 2014 and became Microsoft’s largest shareholder that same year. He bought the NBA’s Los Angeles Clippers for $2 billion in 2014, an investment that is estimated to be worth $4.6 billion today.

One such couple recently sought advice from financial expert Suze Orman on whether to buy a home or rent a luxury senior apartment.

The husband and wife are financially secure, with a combined monthly income of over $9,000 from pensions and Social Security, savings of around $100,000, and $850,000 in an IRA, annuity, and Roth account.

Don't Miss:

The average American couple has saved this much money for retirement — How do you compare ?

Warren Buffett once said, ""If you don't find a way to make money while you sleep, you will work until you die."" These high-yield real estate notes that pay 7.5% – 9% make earning passive income easier than ever.

Orman first highlighted the couple's solid financial standing, noting they have no debt and can sell their current home for $450,000 to $500,000 without incurring capital gains tax. This financial freedom means buying or renting isn't strictly about money but lifestyle preferences and practical considerations.

She pointed out the physical demands of home maintenance as a significant factor for retirees. ""They are in their seventies and are not sure if they are up to the challenge of daily housekeeping maintenance at their age,"" she said. KT KT echoed these concerns, highlighting that such tasks become increasingly burdensome as people age.

""After 70, you start to feel it,"" KT remarked, highlighting the importance of considering one's physical capabilities when deciding on living arrangements.

The couple is torn between the husband's preference for buying a home and the wife's inclination toward a luxury senior community apartment. The wife enjoys socializing and traveling, benefiting from the amenities and services such communities provide.

Suze Orman provided a compelling argument for the wife's choice, focusing on the benefits of senior community living. ""You have a community around you,"" she said, recounting the positive experiences of both her mother and KT's mother in similar settings. These communities offer various activities and social opportunities, such as happy hours, educational classes, movies, swimming, and golf.

Trending: Elon Musk and Jeff Bezos are bullish on one city that could dethrone New York and become the new financial capital of the US. Investing in its booming real estate market has never been more accessible.

Orman stressed the importance of moving to a senior community while both partners are healthy. ""In most cases, you can't move in if one of you is seriously ill,"" she advised, urging the couple to make the transition sooner rather than later. She also noted women’s higher life expectancy, which could leave the wife managing a house alone if her husband passes away first.

Story continues

Orman humorously warned, ""Your husband probably shouldn't hear this part of the answer,"" referring to the predominantly female demographics of senior communities and the social perks for the few men who live there.

Financial experts often advise evaluating the costs and benefits of both options for seniors with existing homes like this couple. Selling a house can free up equity that can be used to fund other retirement needs or investments while renting can simplify life by eliminating the need for ongoing maintenance and large, unexpected expenses.

While buying a home can offer stability, and potential equity growth, renting may provide a more carefree lifestyle, especially valuable in the later stages of life.

Financially, the couple can afford either option. Orman, however, leaned toward the wife's preference for a senior community, emphasizing its convenience and reduced responsibilities. She advised the husband to ""listen to your wife here because, in the long run, you're gonna be so happy that you did.""

If you’re exploring options for your retirement living arrangements, remember that the right choice depends on your individual needs and priorities. Consider factors like home maintenance, social engagement, and desired lifestyle when making this important decision. Consulting with a financial advisor can provide valuable guidance and ensure you make the best choice for your golden years.

Yahoo Finance,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/blackrock-launches-stock-etf-100-144057919.html,2024-07-01,14:40:57 UTC,BlackRock launches stock ETF with 100% downside hedge,"By Manya Saini

(Reuters) -BlackRock has launched a 'buffer' exchange-traded fund that seeks to offer a 100% downside hedge to risk-shy investors looking to tap the equity markets, the world's largest asset manager said on Monday.

So-called buffer or risk-managed ETFs help maximize returns from an asset for investors and simultaneously provide downside protection over a specific period.

The novel product will likely appeal to investors who are hoping to ride a rally in the stock markets as they continue to trade near record highs, but are concerned that a slowing economy and higher-for-longer interest rates can together hurt sentiment going forward.

Buffer ETFs also typically see lower redemption requests during times of heavy market volatility.

""BlackRock is not early - and actually is a little late - to the buffered ETF game, but with (the company's) size, reach, and marketing machine, it has a fair chance of catching up with and surpassing earlier market entrants,"" said Michael Ashley Schulman, partner and CIO at Running Point Capital Advisors.

""Launching buffered ETFs now, when the market is near all-time highs and many investors are nervous - especially with inflation, upcoming elections, and expanding debt - could be especially fortuitous for them,"" he added.

The iShares Large Cap Max Buffer Jun ETF started trading on Monday under the ticker symbol 'MAXJ'.

The asset manager said the ETF will track the returns of the benchmark S&P 500 using options with an upside cap, while providing a 100% hedge to all downside for roughly a year.

""With record levels of cash sitting on the sidelines, many investors are looking for tools to help navigate market volatility before they step back into the market,"" said Rachel Aguirre, head of U.S. iShares product, BlackRock.

BlackRock added that it now manages $25 billion in assets under management across more than 40 active ETFs in the United States, as of June 30.

Yahoo Finance,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/billionaire-bill-ackman-almost-20-103000451.html,2024-07-02,10:30:00 UTC,"Billionaire Bill Ackman Has Almost 20% of His Pershing Square Portfolio Invested in This ""Magnificent Seven"" Stock","The average investor can learn a lot by following some of the professionals in the industry. Take Bill Ackman, whose strategy -- probably influenced by the great Warren Buffett -- focuses on making concentrated bets in high-quality businesses trading at compelling valuations.

Ackman's hedge fund firm, called Pershing Square Capital Management, currently manages $10.8 billion in assets. Rather than blindly following his portfolio decisions, investors should try to understand why he owns what he does.

One of Ackman's top holdings is tech titan Alphabet (NASDAQ: GOOGL) (NASDAQ: GOOG). Let's look at what factors may have drawn the hedge fund manager's attention to this dominant ""Magnificent Seven"" company.

Quality business

Pershing Square first purchased shares in Alphabet over a year ago during the first quarter of 2023. It might be surprising to see it quickly becoming a huge position. But Ackman went so far as to call this ""one of the world's greatest businesses."" That might be a bold statement, but I wouldn't disagree with his assessment.

Most readers are familiar with Google Search. With 91% share of the global search industry, this is undoubtedly Alphabet's bread-and-butter segment. Ackman calls out its powerful network effects and high barriers to entry.

Acquired by the business in 2006 for over $1.6 billion, YouTube also deserves some attention. Not only does it possess network effects as well, but it supports Alphabet's dominance in the digital ad industry. Ackman believes that the business is well-positioned to continue growing its sales over time due to the shift away from offline advertising to online methods.

Alphabet is poised to benefit from another secular trend, which is cloud computing. As IT spend transitions from on-site to off-premises, Google Cloud should continue its rise. This segment posted a 26% revenue gain in 2023, and it's now generating consistent operating income.

If you look through the Pershing Square portfolio, you'll realize that Ackman appreciates companies that are in a strong financial position. There are very few businesses in the world that can match Alphabet in this regard. As of March 31, it did carry $13.2 billion of long-term debt on the balance sheet. However, the company had $108.1 billion of cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities, virtually eliminating any financial risk.

AI leader

The artificial intelligence (AI) boom is drawing lots of attention from the investment community. After Chat GPT was first launched in late 2022, the market was worried that Alphabet was falling behind rivals when it came to developing this technology and introducing new features. But Ackman believes that this concern was overblown.

Story continues

Alphabet was using AI in Search as far back as 2001. And nearly all of its offerings, from YouTube and Maps to Gmail and Google Cloud, all utilize AI in some way. The fact that this business has such wide reach means that it can launch new AI features to almost instant adoption. Plus, Alphabet has the financial resources and technological know-how to be one of the leaders in AI going forward.

Is it too late to buy Alphabet stock?

With the benefit of hindsight, Ackman's purchase of Alphabet shares looked like an incredibly timely move. When his firm started buying the stock, it traded at a compelling forward price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio of just 16. This investment has worked out extremely well thus far, as shares are up 109% in the past 18 months.

Of course, the situation isn't as much of a no-brainer these days. As of this writing, Alphabet stock sells at a forward P/E multiple of 24.4. While not as good as the price Ackman paid, I still think this valuation makes shares a smart buy today.

Yahoo Finance,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/cathie-wood-bought-stock-every-111500772.html,2024-07-01,11:15:00 UTC,Cathie Wood Bought This Stock Every Day Last Month: Should You?,"One thing you can say about Cathie Wood is that she's persistent. The aggressive growth investor who's also the co-founder, CEO, and ace stock picker at Ark Invest enjoys swinging the fences. She's also not afraid to go for the safe single, binge-buying some of her favorite holdings over and over again.

She publishes Ark Invest's transactions at the end of every market day. Something out of the ordinary happened on Friday night, as she announced her purchases from earlier in the day. PagerDuty (NYSE: PD) was one of the six existing positions that she added to on Friday. More importantly, she bought shares of the cloud-based provider of enterprise analytics and uptime monitoring solutions every single trading day in June. She obviously likes PagerDuty right now. Should you? Let's take a closer look.

Reporting for duty

Enterprise software companies are all about making businesses more efficient, and that's what PagerDuty's growing suite of offerings aims to accomplish. From automation tools that help increase task completion speeds and lower support costs to its incident management platform that allows clients to navigate through hiccups and come out of disruptions even smarter, PagerDuty's ambitious isn't on trial.

Growth has been the problem, particularly given its recent run of slowing top-line gains. Year-over-year revenue growth has decelerated for seven consecutive financial reports, from a starting point of 34% down to just 8% nearly two years later.

Q2 2023: 34%

Q3 2023: 31%

Q4 2023: 29%

Q1 2024: 21%

Q2 2024: 19%

Q3 2024: 15%

Q4 2024: 10%

Q1 2025: 8%

PagerDuty's dollar-based net retention rate has disintegrated from 116% to 106% over the past year, and its paid customers count has stalled around 15,100 in that time. The bottom line has also been problematic. It has never turned a profit on a reported basis, and analysts don't see that changing anytime soon. It did announce a small round of layoffs earlier this year, but it remains to be seen if the cost controls will pay off without sacrificing a potential return to top-line growth.

Knocking on Wood

Cathie Wood naturally has a more upbeat read on PagerDuty than the downward sloping fundamentals. She has been buying a piece of PagerDuty every trading day since May 31. Despite the recent daily trickle of purchases, it remains one of the smallest positions across the combined holdings of Ark Invest's exchange-traded funds.

She's not the only one who was buying. Shares of PagerDuty soared 21% last month.

There are some reasons to be upbeat about PagerDuty's near-term prospects. For starters, despite the single-digit revenue growth that PagerDuty posted in its latest quarter, Wall Street pros see it returning to double-digit revenue gains for the entire fiscal year and accelerating in each of the next two years.

Story continues

Profitability on an adjusted basis is also expected to climb 14% next year and another 24% in fiscal 2027. This prices PagerDuty stock at 23 times that fiscal year's adjusted earnings, but it has also posted double-digit percentage beats in each of the past four reports.

The naysayers are still plentiful, and that's not necessarily a bad thing. Nearly 12% of PagerDuty's shares are currently being sold short, approaching the all-time high it notched earlier this year. In the right environment, even a modest bullish catalyst can send the boo-birds scrambling for cover, and the short squeeze would theoretically push the stock higher.

Sentiment could be turning after a buoyant June. Chad Bennett at Craig-Hallum upgraded the stock last week, rallying around the potential for revenue gains to accelerate after bottoming out in the fiscal first quarter. His new $30 price target implies another 31% of upside in the shares. A reignited PagerDuty should result in either the resumption of customer growth or a reversal in the retreat of its dollar-based net retention rate. In an ideal world it would be a little bit of both leading the charge, and PagerDuty reaching reported profitability sooner than expected. For now, a once out-of-favor software-as-a-service company -- or SaaS stock -- is starting to court believers. Wood seems to have the right idea when it comes to buying PagerDuty this summer.

Yahoo Finance,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/1-stock-split-stock-confidently-090600417.html,2024-07-01,09:06:00 UTC,"1 Stock-Split Stock You Can Confidently Buy for the Second Half of 2024, and 2 to Avoid","With the exception of artificial intelligence (AI), there's not a hotter trend on Wall Street right now than companies conducting stock splits.

A stock split is an event where a publicly traded company cosmetically alters its share price and outstanding share count by the same magnitude. It's ""cosmetic"" in the sense that changing a company's share price and share count by the same factor has no effect on its market cap or operating performance.

Image source: Getty Images.

There are two types of stock splits: forward and reverse. With a forward-stock split, companies are angling to make their shares more nominally affordable for retail investors who might not have access to fractional-share purchases with their broker. Meanwhile, a reverse-stock split aims to increase a company's share price, often with the goal of ensuring it meets the minimum continued listing standards on a major stock exchange.

Most investors tend to favor forward-stock splits, because the companies enacting forward splits are typically out-innovating and out-executing their peers.

Since 2024 began, nine high-profile stocks have announced or completed a stock split. However, not all of these stock-split stocks share the same outlook. As we motor into the second half of 2024, one of these stock-split stocks stands out as a phenomenal deal for patient investors, while two others are worth avoiding.

Stock-split stock No. 1 that's worth avoiding in the second half of 2024: Nvidia

In spite of its undeniable popularity, AI juggernaut Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA) is the first stock-split I'd suggest investors purposefully avoid for the final six months of 2024. Nvidia announced a 10-for-1 forward split on May 22, which was completed on June 7.

Although I'm no fan of Nvidia from an investment perspective, I'm happy to give the company credit where it's due. Nvidia's AI-graphics processing units (GPUs) have set the standard in high-compute data centers. According to semiconductor analysis firm TechInsights, it was responsible for 98% of the 3.85 million AI-GPUs that were shipped last year. Having first-mover and compute advantages over its peers has given the company substantial pricing power.

But this is where the praise ends and history works its way back into the discussion.

Since the advent of the internet in the mid-1990s, there hasn't been a buzzy innovation, technology, or trend that avoided an early stage euphoria-bursting event. This is to say that investors have overestimated the adoption and/or utility of every next-big-thing innovation or technology for 30 years (including the internet itself). While this doesn't mean artificial intelligence and Nvidia can't be wildly successful over the long run, the simple fact that most businesses lack a concrete plan for AI suggests a bubble is brewing.

Story continues

To add to this point, Nvidia's trailing-12-month price-to-sales (P/S) ratio is strikingly similar to the P/S ratio peaks we witnessed from Cisco Systems and Amazon prior to the dot-com bubble bursting. History may not precisely repeat on Wall Street, but it does have a tendency to rhyme.

We're also starting to see evidence that competition will weigh on Nvidia's monopoly like market share in AI-accelerated data centers. Even if the company's GPUs were to maintain their compute advantages, new competitors can benefit from demand overwhelming supply — and Nvidia can't meet all of its enterprise demand.

Furthermore, Nvidia's four-largest customers by net sales are internally developing their own AI-GPUs. Even if these chips are used as a complement to Nvidia's H100 GPU, it signals the intent by America's most-influential businesses to reduce their reliance on Nvidia's hardware.

Stock-split stock No. 2 to keep your distance from in the latter half of 2024: Chipotle Mexican Grill

The second stock-split stock that investors would be wise to avoid in the second half of 2024 is none other than the hottest fast-casual restaurant chain on Wall Street, Chipotle Mexican Grill (NYSE: CMG). Chipotle's board announced the company's first-ever stock split (a 50-for-1 forward split) on March 19, with its share adjustment occurring after the closing bell on June 25.

Similar to Nvidia, I can recognize that Chipotle and its management team have done a lot right, even if I'm not currently a fan from an investment standpoint. Chipotle shares have rallied more than 14,800% since its initial public offering price of $22 in January 2006 due to a combination of simplicity and innovation.

Chipotle has kept things simple by sourcing its vegetables locally (when possible), using responsibly raised meats, prepping its food daily, and avoiding a bulky menu. The result is a well-oiled machine that quickly prepares meals and keeps lines in its stores moving.

But there's only so much innovation that can be squeezed out of a fast-casual restaurant chain. While the introduction of mobile order-dedicated drive-thru lanes (""Chipotlanes"") has helped the company immensely, Chipotle's same-store sales grew by only 7% during the first quarter. Though 7% same-store sales growth would be phenomenal for most businesses, it's a genuine eyesore for a company valued at roughly 50 times forward-year earnings.

I'll also add that 1.6% of the 7% organic growth rate in existing stores came from an ""increase in average check."" While it's always good news when a company enjoys strong pricing power, nearly a quarter of Chipotle's organic sales growth is simply due to inflation.

Considering that there are still predictive indicators that suggest a U.S. economic downturn is on the horizon — e.g., the historic decline in U.S. M2 money supply — companies with premium valuations in traditionally slower-growing industries, like Chipotle, are the likeliest to get thumped if a recession does materialize.

The stock-split stock you can confidently buy for the second half of 2024: Sirius XM Holdings

Out of the nine high-profile companies to have announced a stock split in 2024, eight are conducting forward splits. However, the best value of the group is the only top-tier company slated to complete a reverse-stock split: satellite-radio provider Sirius XM Holdings (NASDAQ: SIRI).

In a June 17 filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission, Sirius XM announced its intent to conduct a 1-for-10 reverse split upon completing its merger with Liberty Media's Sirius XM tracking stock, Liberty Sirius XM Group. This combination and share consolidation, which'll create a single outstanding share base, is expected to close during the third quarter.

Although reverse-stock splits are usually undertaken by companies on the decline, Sirius XM's operating performance has pointed to steady growth over the long haul.

One of the keys to Sirius XM's success is its revenue diversity. Terrestrial and online radio providers generate most of their sales from advertising. The thing about advertising is that it's highly cyclical and prone to fluctuations. Sirius XM brought in less than 19% of its first-quarter sales from ads (via Pandora).

By comparison, Sirius XM generated close to 78% of its sales in the March-ended quarter from subscriptions. Subscribers to its satellite-radio services are far less likely to cancel than businesses are to reduce their ad spending during periods of economic turbulence. Couple this with the fact that Sirius XM is the only licensed satellite-radio operator — ergo, it has exceptionally strong pricing power — and you have a recipe for steady operating cash flow in virtually any economic climate.

Additionally, Sirius XM enjoys better cost transparency than most radio operators. Whereas content and royalty costs are going to ebb-and-flow from quarter to quarter, transmission and equipment expenses aren't going to change much, if at all, regardless of how many subscribers the company adds.

At no point in Sirius XM's 30 years as a publicly traded company has it been cheaper than it is now. Shares can be scooped up by opportunistic investors for just 8 times forward-year earnings, which represents a 55% discount to its average forward-year earnings multiple over the last five years.

No later than 45 days following the end to a quarter, institutional investors with at least $100 million in assets under management (AUM) are required to file Form 13F with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). A 13F allows investors an over-the-shoulder look at what Wall Street's billionaires have been buying and selling.

The latest round of 13Fs show that billionaire money managers were especially active in high-growth stocks during the March-ended quarter. More specifically, they were busy dumping shares of Wall Street's hottest megacap growth stock and absolutely piling into two other hypergrowth companies.

C'est la vie, Nvidia!

There's probably not a hotter stock on Wall Street right now than AI kingpin Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA). At its peak two weeks ago, Nvidia briefly surpassed Microsoft and Apple to gain the title of ""most-valuable public company."" Since the start of 2023, Nvidia's market cap surged by as much as $3 trillion, which necessitated a 10-for-1 stock split last month.

The catalyst behind this monumental run in Nvidia's stock is its market-leading AI hardware. The company's AI-driven graphics processing units (GPUs) rapidly became the standard in high-compute data centers. With Nvidia set to roll out its next-generation AI-GPU architecture (Blackwell) later this year, it should have no trouble sustaining its compute advantage.

Despite this seemingly flawless ramp in its operations, eight prominent billionaire investors dumped shares of this market leader during the first quarter, including (total shares sold in parenthesis):

Philippe Laffont of Coatue Management (2,937,060 shares).

Ken Griffin of Citadel Advisors (2,462,716 shares).

Israel Englander of Millennium Management (720,004 shares).

Stanley Druckenmiller of Duquesne Family Office (441,551 shares).

John Overdeck and David Siegel of Two Sigma Investments (420,801 shares).

David Tepper of Appaloosa (348,000 shares).

Steven Cohen of Point72 Asset Management (304,505 shares).

Story continues

It's certainly plausible that these eight billionaires were simply locking in gains after a monster run higher by Nvidia. But it's also possible that headwinds are beginning to surface and becoming recognized by Wall Street's wisest billionaire money managers.

For example, Nvidia is set to face its first real bout of competition. Intel should begin shipping its Gaudi 3 AI-accelerator chip on a broad scale sometime this quarter, while Advanced Micro Devices has continued to ramp up production of its MI300X AI-GPU. With enterprise demand for AI-GPUs overwhelming supply, it shouldn't be difficult for Intel and AMD to grab market share from Nvidia.

What's more, Nvidia is facing competition from within. Its four top customers, which account for approximately 40% of its net sales, are developing AI-GPUs of their own. While these chips aren't going to outperform Nvidia's on a compute basis, the development of these chips represents a clear sign that its leading customers are aiming to lessen their reliance on the AI kingpin.

Perhaps the biggest warning for Nvidia is that every game-changing innovation and technology for 30 years has navigated its way through an early-stage bubble. This is to say that investors have consistently overestimated the adoption of next-big-thing innovations for three decades. Artificial intelligence is unlikely to break this trend.

More than a half-dozen billionaires are making waves in Sea

Although the stock market is historically pricey, Wall Street's billionaire investors did mash the buy button for a couple of hypergrowth stocks, including Singapore-based Sea Limited (NYSE: SE). Q1 saw eight billionaire asset managers buy shares (total shares purchased in parenthesis):

Steven Cohen of Point72 Asset Management (1,527,446 shares).

Philippe Laffont of Coatue Management (678,308 shares).

Chase Coleman of Tiger Global Management (675,900 shares).

John Overdeck and David Siegel of Two Sigma Investments (338,720 shares).

Leon Cooperman of Omega Advisors (240,000 shares).

Ken Griffin of Citadel Advisors (190,432 shares).

Jeff Yass of Susquehanna International (17,902 shares).

What makes Sea such an appealing investment to billionaires is that it has three unique, fast-growing operating segments.

The division that's historically been the most profitable is its digital-entertainment operations, known as ""Garena."" As you can imagine, mobile gaming was exceptionally popular during the COVID-19 pandemic. Though the percentage of paying users, relative to quarterly active users, has dipped from its peak during the height of the pandemic, the 8.2% of users who were paying customers during Q1 is many multiples higher than the pay-to-play average for the mobile-gaming industry.

The second rapidly growing operating segment is SeaMoney, which covers digital-financial services. Many of the countries Sea operates in are chronically underbanked, with consumers and businesses lacking access to digital banking and basic financial services. SeaMoney is helping to facilitate these transactions in emerging-market economies.

The third, and arguably most important, operating segment is e-commerce platform Shopee. Gross merchandise value (GMV) traversing its platform totaled $23.6 billion in Q1, which equates to $94.4 billion on an annual run rate basis. For some context, Shopee saw $10.3 billion in GMV for the entirety of 2018. This demonstrates just how quickly Sea's online marketplace has scaled and explains why billionaire investors are so excited about the company's prospects.

A trio of top-tier billionaires have gobbled up shares of Arm

The other hypergrowth stock that billionaires were busy buying instead of Nvidia is semiconductor juggernaut Arm Holdings (NASDAQ: ARM). Q1 saw three billionaires beef up their stakes or open a position, including two who were big-time sellers of Nvidia's stock (total shares purchased in parenthesis):

Ken Griffin of Citadel Advisors (1,170,604 shares).

Israel Englander of Millennium Management (424,329 shares).

Jeff Yass of Susquehanna International (127,848 shares).

Renaissance Technologies was a buyer of Arm shares as well, but I left this well-known quantitative hedge fund off the list since its billionaire founder Jim Simons passed away in May.

The allure of Arm Holdings for billionaire investors is the company's moat. Arm is responsible for designing central processing units (CPUs), GPUs, and other forms of intellectual property (IP) for which it receives royalty and licensing revenue. In other words, industry giants like Nvidia and Microsoft are using Arm designs to develop the chips that will power the training of large language models and oversee generative AI solutions for years to come. Arm brings in all of its revenue from royalties and licensing.

Aside from having the most-influential businesses utilizing its IP, Arm should benefit from developing more energy-efficient solutions for the AI revolution and data-center economy. If Arm can continue to deliver cost savings for its customers, it'll further solidify its moat as a foundational company.

Perhaps the biggest challenge Arm is going to face is convincing Wall Street and investors that its stock is worth a hefty premium. Despite surpassing Wall Street's consensus earnings-per-share (EPS) forecast in all three quarters since going public last year, Arm is currently valued at 80 times forward-year earnings. While some level of premium appears warranted given its competitive edge, a multiple of 80 times consensus EPS for the upcoming year, with revenue growth of around 20%, leaves little margin for error.

Yahoo Finance,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/3-warren-buffett-stocks-screaming-092100428.html,2024-07-01,09:21:00 UTC,3 Warren Buffett Stocks That Are Screaming Buys for the Second Half of 2024 (and Beyond),"If you've ever wondered why Berkshire Hathaway (NYSE: BRK.A)(NYSE: BRK.B) CEO Warren Buffett draws in the neighborhood of 40,000 investors to his company's shareholder meeting each year, look no further than his track record. Since taking over the CEO role in the mid-1960s, the ""Oracle of Omaha"" has overseen a nearly 4,964,000% return in his company's Class A shares (BRK.A), which compares quite favorably to the roughly 36,000% total return, including dividends paid, for the broad-based S&P 500 over the same span.

For nearly six decades, Buffett and his top-notch investment team have had a knack for picking out time-tested bargains hiding in plain sight.

At the moment, Berkshire has stakes in 44 stocks and two exchange-traded funds spanning $388 billion of invested assets. But among these holdings are three Warren Buffett stocks that represent screaming buys for the second half of 2024, and likely well beyond.

Amazon

The first Warren Buffett stock that stands out for all the right reasons for the second half of 2024 and well beyond is e-commerce leader Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN).

The knock against Amazon has always been its relatively ""expensive"" valuation, at least when using traditional fundamental metrics, such as the price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio. While the time-tested P/E ratio works great when attempting to value mature businesses, this go-to metric tends to come up short when analyzing fast-growing companies that are regularly reinvesting their cash flow back into their operations.

Chances are that you're familiar with Amazon because of its superior e-commerce platform. In 2023, Amazon is estimated to have garnered a nearly 38% share of U.S. online retail sales. While this would, in theory, expose the company to weakness if the U.S. or global economy were to fall into a recession, the important thing to recognize about Amazon is that its operating cash flow and income almost exclusively originate from its faster-growing ancillary operations.

For investors, nothing is more important than Amazon Web Services (AWS). AWS is the world's leading cloud infrastructure service platform, and it recently surpassed $100 billion in annualized run-rate sales. What's noteworthy about this psychological run-rate revenue milestone is that businesses are still in the relatively early stages of ramping up their cloud-service spending. Since cloud-service margins are considerably juicier than the margins associated with online retail sales, AWS is typically responsible for 50% to 100% of Amazon's operating income.

Story continues

Beyond AWS, Amazon is also relying on advertising services and subscription services to do some heavy lifting. Amazon draws around 2.5 billion unique visitors to its site each month, which is more than eyeballs enough to attract advertisers.

Meanwhile, the company surpassed 200 million global Prime subscribers in April 2021 and has likely added to this total as its content library and e-commerce platform have grown. Like AWS, advertising services and subscription services offer sustained double-digit sales growth.

Despite recently hitting a new all-time high, Amazon is historically cheap relative to cash flow projections. Throughout the 2010s, investors regularly paid 23 to 37 times year-end cash flow to own shares of Amazon. You can buy shares right now for about 13 times estimated cash flow per share in 2025.

Chevron

A second no-brainer Warren Buffett stock that's begging to be bought for the second half of 2024 (and beyond) is global energy giant Chevron (NYSE: CVX).

The clearest headwind current and prospective Chevron shareholders have to contend with is the prospect of a recession taking shape in the U.S. or abroad. Oil and gas stocks tend to ebb-and-flow with the spot price of crude oil and natural gas. During periods of economic weakness, it's not uncommon for commodity-driven companies to struggle.

The good news for Chevron is that macro factors are decisively working in its favor. Even with select predictive indicators cautioning of a coming recession -- e.g., the first drop off in U.S. M2 money supply since the Great Depression -- the U.S. economy has remained resilient.

To add to this point, the unprecedented demand uncertainty associated with the COVID-19 pandemic led global energy majors (including Chevron) to scale back their capital expenditures (capex) for a good three years. Even with capex ramping back up, the global supply of crude oil has been constrained. When the supply of an in-demand good is tight, it tends to have a positive effect on the spot price of that good. In simpler terms, it's buoying the price of oil, which in turn is generating more operating cash flow for Chevron's drilling segment.

Perhaps one of the biggest catalysts for the second half of 2024 and into 2025 is Chevron's pending deal to acquire Hess in an all-share transaction valued at $53 billion. If this buyout gets the green light from regulators, Chevron is going to add 465,000 net acres in the oil-rich Bakken Shale, as well as meaningfully increase its oil-equivalent exposure in Guyana. If the price of oil remains elevated, it makes this deal all the sweeter.

Although drilling is where Chevron derives its best margins, don't overlook that it's also an integrated operator. The company's transmission pipelines, refineries, and chemical plants act as a hedge in the event that the spot price of crude oil declines. The steady operating cash flow from these ancillary operating segments has played a key role in Chevron being able to increase its base annual dividend for 37 consecutive years.

The icing on the cake is that Chevron's stock is, also, historically inexpensive. Shares can be grabbed right now for less than 11 times forward-year earnings, which represents a 23% discount to its average forward-year multiple over the trailing-five-year period.

Coca-Cola

The third Warren Buffett stock that's a screaming buy for the second half of 2024, and likely well beyond, is beverage behemoth Coca-Cola (NYSE: KO).

Whereas an economic downturn is arguably the biggest enemy for Amazon and Chevron, the prospect of above-average inflation is typically viewed as the most front-and-center headwind for consumer staples companies. When the price of goods and services is rising at an above-average rate, there's always a concern that consumers may be forced to pare back their spending.

The good news for Coca-Cola is that it provides a basic necessity product. Regardless of what's happening with the U.S. economy or Wall Street, consumers are still going to purchase beverages. Given the company's strong branding, Coca-Cola rarely has any trouble increasing its prices to offset rising expenses.

Speaking of strong branding, Coca-Cola was named the ""most-chosen brand"" by consumers for a 12th straight year in Kantar's latest ""Brand Footprint"" report. This dominance is a reflection of Coca-Cola's top-tier marketing campaign, which involves using digital channels and artificial intelligence (AI) to reach younger audiences, while leaning on more than a century of history and well-known brand ambassadors to connect with its mature consumers.

From an operating perspective, Coca-Cola is firing on all cylinders. Although it's not the growth story it once was, it has the right puzzle pieces in place to deliver consistent mid-single-digit sales and earnings growth. It has more than two dozen brands generating at least $1 billion in annual sales, and is operating in all but three countries (Cuba, North Korea, and Russia). This gives Coca-Cola a steady stream of predictable cash flow in developed countries, and needle-moving organic growth potential in emerging markets.

Coca-Cola is also known for its top-tier capital-return program. In February, the company increased its quarterly dividend by 5.4%, which marked the 62nd consecutive year it's lifted its payout. Berkshire Hathaway is generating a roughly 60% annual yield relative to its cost basis in Coca-Cola stock.

Lastly -- and to stay on theme -- the valuation makes sense. Coca-Cola's forward P/E ratio of 21 is roughly 10% below its average forward-year earnings multiple over the last five years.

Yahoo Finance,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/time-pounce-2-ultra-high-092100247.html,2024-07-02,09:21:00 UTC,Time to Pounce: 2 Ultra-High-Yield Dividend Stocks That Are Begging to Be Bought for the Second Half of 2024 (and Beyond),"There are a lot of ways for investors to grow their wealth. They can buy Treasury bonds, a commodity like oil or gold, or purchase a home and let it increase in value over time. But when compared to other asset classes, stocks have delivered the highest average annual return over the last century.

One of the best aspects of putting your money to work on Wall Street is that, with thousands of stocks and exchange-traded funds (ETFs) to choose from, there's a very high probability of one or more securities matching your risk tolerance and investment goals.

Although growth stocks have driven all three major indexes to record levels in 2024, it's dividend stocks that have handily outperformed on Wall Street over the last half-century.

Image source: Getty Images.

In 2023, the investment advisors at Hartford Funds, in collaboration with Ned Davis Research, released a comprehensive report on the advantages dividend stocks bring to the table for investors. In particular, researchers compared the performance of dividend-paying companies to non-payers over the prior 50 years (1973-2023).

Based on their findings, dividend stocks averaged a 9.17% annual return over a half-century, and did so while being 6% less volatile than the broad-based S&P 500. This compares to a more modest 4.27% average annual return for non-payers, which were 18% more volatile than the benchmark index.

The biggest challenge for income seekers is avoiding a yield trap -- i.e., a company with a broken operating model whose falling share price has artificially pumped up its dividend yield. Thankfully, safe, ultra-high-yield dividend stocks do exist.

What follows are two ultra-high-yield dividend stocks -- companies with yields that are at least four times higher than the current yield (1.33%) of the S&P 500 -- that can be confidently pounced on by opportunistic income seekers in the second half of 2024.

Realty Income: 5.98% yield

The first high-octane dividend stock that investors can pile into for the second half of the year is premier retail real estate investment trust (REIT) Realty Income (NYSE: O). Realty Income doles out its dividend on a monthly basis, and has increased its payout for a jaw-dropping 107 consecutive quarters.

O Dividend Chart

As you're liable to note from Realty Income's stock chart, it hasn't participated in the current bull market rally. The reason for its poor performance over the last two years is primarily the result of monetary policy changes from the Federal Reserve.

Beginning in March 2022, the nation's central bank began undertaking its most aggressive rate-hiking cycle since the early 1980s. During this process, yields on short-term U.S. Treasury bills soared. Instead of buying various REITs, investors have opted to generate similar yields from purchasing Treasury bills, which have almost nonexistent risk to invested principal.

Story continues

However, this dynamic is unlikely to continue for much longer. Even though core inflation has remained stubbornly high, the Fed is more likely to reduce interest rates than increase them, as evidenced by the recent movement we've witnessed in Treasury bond yields. With Realty Income's yield rising to 6%, this absolutely puts this monthly dividend icon back on the radar.

What makes Realty Income the company that other retail REITs envy is its massive, but exceptionally resilient, commercial real estate (CRE) portfolio. As of the end of March, the company owned nearly 15,500 CRE properties. But here's the kicker: Approximately 90% of its total rent ""is resilient to economic downturns and/or isolated from e-commerce pressures,"" according to the company.

Realty Income's not-so-subtle secret is that it tends to lease stand-alone stores to time-tested, brand-name businesses that provide basic need goods and services. For instance, grocery stores, convenience stores, dollar stores, home improvement, drugstores, and automotive service lessees collectively account for 42% of annualized contractual rent. Consumers will need food, beverages, prescription medicines, and vehicle maintenance/repairs, regardless of how well or poorly the U.S. economy is performing.

What's more, Realty Income has a superior track record relative to other S&P 500 REITs when it comes to tenant occupancy. Since the start of this century, its median occupancy rate of 98.2% is 400 basis points higher than the median occupancy rate for S&P 500 REITs.

Another positive for current and prospective investors is that Realty Income has been fortifying its existing CRE portfolio and expanding into new channels. For instance, its January 2024 acquisition of Spirit Realty Capital was complementary to its existing CRE portfolio, but also opened doors in new industries.

Last but not least, Realty Income's stock is trading at a historically cheap valuation, relative to its future cash flow. Whereas shares have averaged a multiple of 17.3 times cash flow over the trailing-five-year period, opportunistic income seekers can buy into the Realty Income growth story right now for 11.8 times forecast cash flow in 2025.

Pfizer: 6% yield

The second ultra-high-yield dividend stock that's begging to be bought for the second half of 2024 (if not well beyond) is pharmaceutical titan Pfizer (NYSE: PFE). Although Pfizer isn't guaranteed to raise its payout on an annual basis, its current yield of 6% is safe.

Pfizer, like Realty Income, has been left in the dust by the current bull market rally. As I've pointed out previously, Pfizer's underperformance is a reflection of it being a victim of its own success.

Pfizer is one of a handful of drugmakers that successfully developed therapies for COVID-19. In 2022, the company's COVID-19 vaccine (Comirnaty) and oral therapy (Paxlovid) brought in north of $56 billion in combined revenue. This year, combined sales for these blockbuster treatments will total around $8 billion. For those of you keeping score at home, this is a $48 billion sales decline that Wall Street and investors have had to come to terms with.

However, perspective changes everything. Though COVID-19 sales aren't close to what they once were, Pfizer wasn't generating a cent in COVID-19 revenue prior to the pandemic. This estimated $8 billion in sales in 2024, coupled with organic growth from existing product lines and newly launched therapeutics, has lifted annual sales from $41.9 billion in 2020 to a mid-range estimate from $60 billion this year.

Digging a bit deeper, Pfizer's March-ended quarter saw sales, excluding COVID-19 therapies, jump by 11% on a constant-currency basis. Continued double-digit operational growth from blockbuster blood-thinning drug Eliquis suggests Pfizer's total portfolio is considerably stronger now than it was four years ago.

Another reason for current and prospective investors to be excited about the future is Pfizer's $43 billion acquisition of cancer-drug developer Seagen, which closed in December. Despite buyout-related costs weighing on Pfizer's 2024 earnings per share (EPS), this combination should result in meaningful cost savings and improved EPS in 2025 and beyond. Moreover, this deal vastly expands Pfizer's oncology pipeline and provides a greater-than $3 billion boost to annual sales right off the bat.

Like Realty Income, Pfizer has macro factors in its corner. Since we have no control over when we become ill or what ailment(s) we develop, demand for everything from prescription medicines to devices tends to remain constant in any economic climate. The point is that Pfizer is highly resistant to economic downturns.

The final piece of the puzzle is that Pfizer's stock is cheaper than it's been in a very long time. Shares of the company recently hit their lowest level in a decade. Further, shares are valued at roughly 10 times forward-year earnings, which is modestly lower than the average multiple of 11 times forward-year EPS that Pfizer's stock has traded at over the prior five years.

Yahoo Finance,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/1-incredible-growth-stock-down-122900631.html,2024-07-01,12:29:00 UTC,1 Incredible Growth Stock Down 81% You'll Regret Not Buying on the Dip,"The S&P 500 has set one new all-time high after another in 2024, but not every stock has participated in the current bull market. Some stocks remain beaten down, well below the highs reached in late 2021 and early 2022.

Some of the companies behind those stocks benefited from the behavior changes ushered in by the COVID-19 pandemic. But as things start to resemble the way things were pre-pandemic, they don't look as attractive. Others, however, look oversold, and their current valuations don't reflect their true potential.

One example of the latter is PayPal (NASDAQ: PYPL). PayPal's share price surged as COVID-19 drove more online and contactless sales. But a couple of bad quarters and a CEO change led to a massive sell-off in shares. The stock currently trades around 81% below the all-time high it reached in mid-2021. Here's why it may be a great opportunity to buy up some shares.

Image source: Getty Images.

It's already showing signs of a turnaround

One of the biggest things weighing on PayPal over the past year was its declining active account total. Active accounts peaked in the fourth quarter of 2022 and experienced four consecutive sequential declines during 2023.

But active accounts increased in the first quarter, climbing 2 million to reach 427 million total. While there's still a long way to go to get back to where it was at the end of 2022, the turnaround progress is encouraging.

The biggest driver of the active account decline was churn from inactive accounts in emerging markets in the Latin America and Asia Pacific regions. It's now growing by adding users who are spending more and more frequently. Total payment volume was up 14% year over year despite fewer users than this time last year. Transactions per active account over the past year reached an all-time high of 60.

The virtuous cycle driving strong engagement growth

The growing engagement of PayPal users signals its network advantage. On one side of the network are consumers and on the other side are merchants. The massive consumer base using PayPal draws more merchants to accept the digital wallet and the growing number of merchants taking PayPal draws more consumers to the platform. A growing number of merchants also gives existing users more opportunities to use PayPal.

There's good reason for merchants to choose PayPal, too. Not only does it add another payment option for around 400 million online shoppers, but it also makes them more likely to complete a transaction. The company reports a 33% increase in checkout conversions when the buyer uses PayPal versus another form of payment.

Story continues

While PayPal faces competition, none of its competitors has a user base the size of PayPal. That makes it practically indispensable for online merchants.

That said, fierce competition can and has weighed on PayPal's ability to charge higher fees for merchants. It also pushed the company to allow more consumer choice in its default payments, instead of forcing them to pay using methods more lucrative for the company (like cash balances).

Still, it's hard to deny PayPal's position as the leading digital wallet, putting it in a prime position for the continued secular growth in e-commerce.

The stock is an absolute bargain

The stock currently trades for a forward price-to-earnings ratio below 14x. That's incredibly low, even if you expect competition to eat into its revenue growth and margins.

Management's updated full-year 2024 guidance calls for mid- to high-single-digit earnings-per-share (EPS) growth. PayPal should be able to drive double-digit revenue growth as it returns to year-over-year active account growth this year. While non-branded checkout has weighed on its gross margin, it's cutting costs in other areas, which should result in stable to growing operating margins. That could mean PayPal exceeds its current full-year outlook.

What's more, PayPal is aggressively buying back shares at this price. It forecasts $5 billion in free cash flow, and management plans to repurchase even more than $5 billion in shares this year. That provides a further boost to earnings per share.

Wall Street analysts currently expect PayPal to grow its earnings per share at a compound annual rate of almost 16% over the next five years as a result of the above factors. So, with shares trading under 14x earnings, they present an incredible bargain for investors.

Yahoo Finance,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/futures-drop-megacaps-retreat-ahead-102453503.html,2024-07-02,10:24:53 UTC,Futures drop as megacaps retreat ahead of key jobs data,"(Reuters) - Wall Street's index futures dipped on Tuesday as megacap stocks pulled back after a strong session, while some caution crept in ahead of jobs opening data and a series of other crucial U.S. labor market reports due throughout the week for monetary policy cues.

Microsoft, Apple and Amazon.com slipped in premarket trading after jumping 2%-3% in the previous day. Tesla shed 1% after Monday's 6% jump ahead of the EV maker's June-quarter deliveries, expected to fall for two straight quarters for the first time.

AI chip leader Nvidia also dropped 1.4%, with other semiconductor stocks such as Micron Technology, Marvell Technology and Arm Holdings also slipping nearly 1%.

On the data front, the job openings and labor turnover survey, or JOLTS, is due after market open and is expected to show job openings fell to 7.910 million in May from 8.059 million in the previous month.

The data would be crucial in determining the state of the U.S. labor market, which remains somewhat resilient even against the backdrop of decades-high interest rates - a key determinant of economic health.

The other jobs data that are due throughout the week include ADP National Employment, weekly jobless claims and non-farm Payrolls. The other prints also scheduled for the week are factory orders and services PMI, coupled with minutes of the Federal Reserve's latest policy meeting.

With the equity market closed on Thursday on account of U.S. Independence Day, trading volumes are expected to be light throughout the week.

As recent data signals a renewed moderation in inflation and some signs of economic weakness, market participants are holding on to their bets around two interest rate cuts by this year-end, starting from September, as per LSEG's FedWatch data.

""We continue to observe that U.S. exceptionalism has somewhat softened. In particular, growing strains were seen on U.S. consumer while the tightness in the U.S. labor market has eased,"" said analysts at OCBC.

""Our house view continues to expect two cuts for 2024, with the first cut happening sometime in the third quarter.""

Further, investors will also parse remarks from Fed Chair Jerome Powell in a policy panel before the European Central Bank forum on central banking.

At 5:31 a.m. ET, Dow e-minis were down 124 points, or 0.31%, S&P 500 e-minis were down 23.25 points, or 0.42%, and Nasdaq 100 e-minis were down 102.25 points, or 0.51%.

Among other major premarket movers, Paramount Global climbed 4.6% after billionaire Barry Diller's digital-media conglomerate IAC is exploring a bid to take control of the media giant.

Yahoo Finance,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/why-nextera-energy-partners-plunged-204818657.html,2024-07-01,20:48:18 UTC,Why NextEra Energy Partners Plunged Today,"Shares of NextEra Energy Partners (NYSE: NEP) fell on Monday, down 8.7% in today's trading.

The master limited partnership (MLP) focused on buying and holding renewable energy projects from parent utility NextEra Energy (NYSE: NEE) was down after a Wall Street analyst downgraded the stock and lowered his price target.

Why? A potential cut to the company's 13.8% dividend could be in the cards.

RBC forecasts a dividend cut for NextEra

In his note today, RBC Capital analyst Shelby Tucker lowered his rating on NextEra Partners from outperform to market perform, cutting his price target from $38 to $30.

Tucker now believes that there aren't enough lower-cost wind repowering opportunities to grow NextEra's earnings to its 5% to 8% target, and that the company may have trouble keeping the dividend this high while also paying off billions of looming convertible equity portfolio financing (CEPF) maturities. These types of project financings enabled NextEra to fund projects in a relatively low-cost and flexible manner, but NEP's CEPF notes were sold when interest rates were much lower. After 2026, there are $3.7 billion of looming maturities that will need to be paid off.

While NextEra has time and options to pay off these liabilities, the increased cost of capital since the CEPFs were sold means that it will be expensive for NextEra to refinance. Thus, while management had contemplated private financings, Tucker thinks the lingering higher interest rate environment will necessitate a cut to the company's distribution. Tucker suspects a 50% cut could be in the cards, and may even be prudent. That would take care of the CEPF financing while leaving the company free from having to take on expensive debt or issue equity. Issuing equity would be painful, with the stock down 68% from its all-time highs.

Be wary of MLPs that pay out high dividends

Investors may have been tempted to buy NextEra in the past due to its ample and growing dividend. But the problem with these MLP models is that when interest rate or economic worries pop up and the stock goes down, the company can no longer issue stock to grow. Thus, the model becomes ""stuck"" and can result in painful dilution or cuts to what once looked like a mouth-watering dividend yield. It looks like that is what's happening with NEP today.

Yahoo Finance,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/nvidias-1-killer-advantage-produce-053512328.html,2024-07-02,05:35:12 UTC,"Nvidia's 1 Killer Advantage Will Produce a ""Cash Gusher"" for Shareholders in the Wake of Its 10-for-1 Stock Split, According to 1 Wall Street Analyst.","There's no denying that Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA) has been on fire since early last year. The stock has soared more than 750% as of this writing, driven higher by the potential implications of generative artificial intelligence (AI). The ability to streamline time-consuming tasks and automate routine processes promises to increase productivity and could unleash a wave of greater profits for businesses that adopt this cutting-edge technology.

Nvidia's graphics processing units (GPUs) are the gold standard and provide the computational horsepower necessary for AI processing. This has let loose a tidal wave of demand for the company's high-end processors, sending its business and financial results surging, resulting in its recent 10-for-1 stock split.

While some investors fear the easy money has been made, others believe the best is yet to come. One analyst suggests Nvidia has a killer advantage that will help it stay ahead of the competition and unleash a ""cash gusher"" that will profit shareholders.

Let's see if the analyst's argument holds water and what it means for investors.

A long track record of success

To understand the source of this ""cash gusher,"" it helps to take a step back to see how Nvidia got to where it is today.

Nvidia's state-of-the-art processors have long been the industry standard for serious gamers. The company controlled 88% of the discrete desktop GPU market in the first quarter, according to data compiled by Jon Peddie Research.

However, Nvidia adapted that same technology to zip data through the ether, becoming the go-to processor for data centers. Estimates suggest the company controls as much as 92% of the data center GPU market, according to IoT Analytics. Nvidia is also the undisputed leader in processing machine learning -- an established branch of AI -- with an estimated 95% of that market, according to data supplied by New Street Research.

Since much of generative AI processing occurs in the cloud and data centers, Nvidia has cemented its position as the leader. The company is set to release its Blackwell family of processors later this year, and CEO Jensen Huang has said, ""The Blackwell Architecture platform will likely be the most successful product in our history."" If that's the case, and I believe that it is, the best could be yet to come.

Furthermore, while the popular narrative says the competition is coming for Nvidia, thus far -- despite years of opportunity -- no serious competitor has emerged.

A ""cash gusher""

Melius Research analyst Ben Reitzes believes Nvidia has one killer advantage that some investors may be overlooking, one that will keep the company on the leading edge of technology. Nvidia provides not only the chips that are tailor-made for AI but also the integrated software that eeks every last ounce of performance from these AI-centric processors. This ""full stack"" approach, or the marrying of hardware and software, provides Nvidia with a key advantage that will be hard for rivals to match, particularly given the company's long track record of leadership in the field.

Story continues

""What they did is they built a computing language and an ecosystem that allows you to monetize AI, and obviously, they're killing it,"" Reitzes said.

The analyst goes on to note that the cadence of Nvidia's research and development (R&D) makes it hard for competitors to keep up. The company recently increased its already relentless pace of innovation, as CEO Jensen Huang said the company is now ""on a one-year rhythm,"" releasing new processors every year instead of every two years. ""They're running 150 miles an hour while everyone else is running 100. It's going to be hard to catch these guys,"" Reitzes said.

As a result of the accelerating adoption of AI and Nvidia's dominant position, it's estimated the company will generate $270 billion in cash in the coming three years, which could unleash a wave of returns to shareholders in the form of stock buybacks and higher dividend payments.

The analyst notes that even with higher R&D spending, the influx of cash will far outweigh any potential uses, suggesting the majority will be returned to shareholders.

Investors are already seeing evidence of that shift. Late last year, Nvidia announced a new $25 billion share repurchase plan. Furthermore, in conjunction with its stock split announcement in May, the company increased its dividend payment by 150%. That said, Nvidia is currently using less than 1% of profits to fund the dividend, and even at its higher rate, the yield is a paltry 0.03%.

This illustrates that there's still ample opportunity for Nvidia to return cash to shareholders, and with the ongoing tsunami of AI adoption, the company will have an increasing amount of resources to do just that. Furthermore, given its killer advantage, its unlikely a rival will take Nvidia's crown, at least not anytime soon.

Yahoo Finance,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/buy-broadcom-july-12-stock-094000694.html,2024-07-02,09:40:00 UTC,Should You Buy Broadcom Before or After the July 12 Stock Split? 1 Detail Gives Us the Answer.,"A wide range of companies have announced stock splits this year after their share prices soared. When these events take place, companies issue additional shares to current stockholders, which lowers the price of each individual share proportionally. The goal is to make it easier for a wider range of investors to buy that particular stock.

Broadcom (NASDAQ: AVGO) has scheduled its 10-for-1 stock split for after the close of trading on July 12; shares will begin trading on a split-adjusted basis as of the opening bell on July 15. The semiconductor and networking giant has benefited from the artificial intelligence (AI) boom, which boosted demand for its AI networking and custom accelerators. That lifted its revenues, and the stock price followed. It has gained nearly 90% over the past year and surpassed $1,800 for a time in June.

This top tech stock would make a solid long-term investment, but now the question is: Should you get in on the shares before the July 12 stock split or after? Let's consider arguments for both strategies -- and discover the one detail that offers us an answer.

Image source: Getty Images.

The case for buying before the split

A stock split doesn't change anything fundamental about a company or its stock. Though the per-share price will be lower, the maneuver doesn't impact valuation in any real way. That means that post-split, the stock actually could be more expensive than it was beforehand. This happened with Nvidia recently -- between the day it made its split announcement and the actual day of the event, the tech giant's shares climbed by nearly 30%.

So if you consider Broadcom a strong long-term player, it would be a great idea to go ahead and buy the stock now rather than waiting for it to complete what is simply a piece of financial juggling.

And there are reasons to be optimistic about Broadcom. The combination of strong AI-related demand and its recent acquisition of cloud software company VMware look set to drive a new era of growth for the company. In its latest reported fiscal quarter, its revenue rose 43% to more than $12 billion thanks to these two elements. Since we're in the early days of the AI boom and VMware integration, there's likely a lot more growth to come.

VMware revenue, from about $2.1 billion in Broadcom's fiscal first quarter, grew to $2.7 billion in its fiscal Q2 (which ended May 5), and management expects it to reach a $4 billion quarterly revenue run rate. And Broadcom forecasts AI revenue for fiscal 2024 of more than $11 billion.

The case for buying after the split

The argument for buying after the split is pretty straightforward too. True, post-split, Broadcom won't necessarily be any cheaper than it is today (unless the stock falls, and stock movements will be unrelated to the split). But a lower price could make it easier for some investors to buy the stock because if you plan on investing less than the stock's current share price, you will be able to do so without relying on fractional shares.

Story continues

So, for example, today if you want to invest $500 in Broadcom and don't have the option through your broker of buying fractional shares (or if you choose not to), you won't be able to directly invest in the company. I say ""directly"" because you can always gain exposure to Broadcom through the many index funds and exchange-traded funds that include the stock in their holdings.

But if you want to avoid the fractional share route, you're probably better off buying the shares post-split.

What should you do?

Both of these arguments are logical -- so which should you follow? Since the split is right around the corner, the decision should come down to the funds you have available to invest. If you plan on investing the amount of Broadcom's current share price or more, there's no reason to wait -- now is a great time to get in on this top AI player.

However, if you're planning on investing less than the current share price, it may be a good idea to invest right after the stock split as you'll more easily be able to access full shares. Fractional shares are fine, but if your brokerage doesn't offer them, trying to get in on Broadcom today may be complicated. After the split, though, you won't have to worry about this.

But what if the stock rises or falls in the coming days, pushing valuation higher or lower? If you're a long-term investor, this won't matter for you, because it won't have much of an impact on your returns a few years down the road. It's impossible to reliably time the market so that you can buy any particular stock at its lowest price. But that's OK. Generally, buying a strong company at a fair price offers you a great chance of generating attractive returns over the long run.

And before or after the upcoming stock split, Broadcom should make a compelling AI growth buy.

Photo by Marco Bello/Getty Images

Cathie Wood's Ark Invest has destroyed $14 billion in wealth over the past decade.

A Morningstar analysis found that Ark Invest topped the list of wealth destroyers among other investment companies.

""These funds managed to lose value for shareholders even during a generally bullish market,"" Morningstar said.

Cathie Wood's Ark Invest has destroyed an estimated $14.3 billion in wealth over the past decade, according to a recent Morningstar analysis.

Ark Invest was all the rage in 2020 and 2021, when its concentrated bets on highly speculative technology companies paid off in a big way thanks to low interest rates and a boom in risk appetite among retail investors.

Ark's flagship innovation ETF, ARKK, soared nearly 150% in 2020, and that massive outperformance helped drive a surge of inflows into its funds right near its peak.

The firm attracted nearly $30 billion in assets in 2020 and 2021, which were then decimated during the 2022 bear market when its flagship fund plunged 67%.

The ARKK ETF destroyed $7.1 billion in wealth, while its healthcare-focused ARK Genomic ETF destroyed $4.2 billion in wealth, according to Morningstar.

Across all fund families that have destroyed wealth over the past decade, Ark Invest topped the list — and its losses were more than double the next firm on the list.

What's striking is that Ark's massive wealth destruction occurred during a favorable time for the stock market.

""These funds managed to lose value for shareholders even during a generally bullish market,"" Morningstar analyst Amy Arnott said.

The ARKK ETF has generated a total positive return of 121.8% since its inception in 2014, which is less than half the Nasdaq 100's gain of 329.5% over the same time period. Meanwhile, the ARKK ETF is still down 71% from its record high.

Despite the massive wealth destruction, ARK Invest as a business is doing just fine. The investment company still has more than $13 billion in assets across its suite of ETFs, signaling that not all investors have abandoned Wood's investment strategy.

But in an investment world that is shifting to valuing profits over growth, it is unclear when Ark Invest's investment strategy might pay off again for investors.

The firm's top holdings currently include Coinbase, Tesla, Roku, and Zoom Video, all of which have had a rough start to 2024.

""The biggest value destroyers in the fund industry illustrate that there's no guarantee of success, even during a generally favorable market environment. They also provide a valuable case study in how not to invest,"" Arnott said.

Yahoo Finance,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/where-palantir-stock-5-years-104500065.html,2024-07-02,10:45:00 UTC,Where Will Palantir Stock Be in 5 Years?,"Sparked by the release of OpenAI's ChatGPT in 2022, the generative artificial intelligence (AI) boom has given companies like Palantir (NYSE: PLTR) a new lease on life. But with its shares up 73% over the past 12 months, has all the growth already been priced in? Let's explore what the next five years could have in store for this software company.

Why Palantir?

Founded in 2003 and going public in 2020, Palantir Technologies can be considered an ""early"" AI company -- pioneering technologies like machine learning and big data analytics. The company operates a software-as-a-service business model in which clients pay a recurring fee for access to its two main platforms: Gotham (targeted at corporate clients) and Foundry (designed for government contracting, security, and defense).

Palantir's defense contracting is key to its economic moat. Unlike the typical software company, Palantir has a long track record of working on classified and sensitive missions, such as the Osama Bin Laden raid in 2011. More recently, the company has helped the Ukrainian armed forces with targeting in their war against Russia. And in January, Palantir inked a deal with Israel to provide services for war-related missions.

But while bringing big tech to conflict zones strengthens Palantir's moat, it could also expose the company to brand damage -- making it more difficult to appeal to the private sector clients that help drive growth and diversify its revenue streams. So far, this doesn't seem to be a problem. First-quarter commercial revenue jumped 27% year over year to $299 million, while government revenue grew 16% to $335 million.

The next five years for Palantir

Palantir's long-term future will depend on how well it can integrate large language models (LLMs) and other generative AI technologies into its existing data analytics solutions. But unfortunately, the commercial side of this opportunity seems incredibly competitive.

Rivals like Snowflake and Microsoft's Fabric offer similar data analytics software without Palantir's political baggage. These companies also boast an in-house cloud computing focus, while Palantir's Foundry relies on third-party cloud service providers like Amazon's AWS, Google Cloud, and Microsoft Azure.



Image source: Getty Images.

The good news is that Palantir's government business looks set for a sustainable boom over the coming years. The geopolitical environment feels as tense as ever with flashpoints in Europe, Africa, the Middle East, and Asia. Meanwhile, personnel shortages and new technologies (such as drones) are increasing demand for the type of labor-saving automation Palantir's software can provide.

Story continues

Along with its work with U.S. allies, Palantir has also scored big contracts with the U.S. Department of Defense. Most recently, it won a $480 million deal with the Army to work on the Maven Smart System, designed to use AI and computer vision to quickly and accurately identify enemy targets. Alphabet walked away from this project in 2018 amid widespread employee protests over ethical concerns. But Palantir's unapologetic defense work makes it more resilient to this type of pressure.

Over the next five years, investors should expect defense contracting to become an increasingly important part of Palantir's overall business.

Is Palantir stock a buy?

Palantir is well-positioned to benefit from improving AI technology and its growing military use cases. But a good company isn't always a great stock. In Palantir's case, valuation is cause for concern.

With a forward price-to-earnings ratio of 70, Palantir's shares are dramatically more expensive than the Nasdaq average of 32. And despite Palantir's strong moat, this is too much to pay for a company that only grew its revenue by 21% in the first quarter. Overvaluation could cause shares to underperform the wider market over the next five years.

Yahoo Finance,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/forget-amd-2024-2-artificial-084000280.html,2024-07-02,08:40:00 UTC,Forget AMD in 2024: 2 Artificial Intelligence (AI) Stocks to Buy Instead,"Over the last year, increased interest in artificial intelligence (AI) has spotlighted several tech stocks that could enjoy major gains as the industry develops. Chipmaker Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ: AMD) has seen its stock soar 150% since the start of 2023, driven primarily by investors' excitement over AI. AMD's second-largest market share in graphics processing units (GPUs) has made Wall Street bullish as similar offerings from Nvidia have flown off the shelves amid the increased demand for the high-powered chips.

However, mediocre quarterly results, alongside a soaring share price, have tanked the value of AMD's stock. The company's business hasn't seen a big enough return on its investment in AI, suggesting there could be better options for backing the high-growth industry.

AMD PE Ratio Chart

This chart uses price-to-earnings (P/E) ratios to compare the valuations of some of the most prominent names in AI. AMD's stock is by far the worst value, with a P/E of 238. However, two companies stand out as bargains compared to their peers: Intel (NASDAQ: INTC) and Alphabet (NASDAQ: GOOGL) (NASDAQ: GOOG).

These companies have expanding ventures in AI that could majorly pay off over the long term, with one investing in AI chip manufacturing and the other quickly growing in AI software.

So, forget AMD in 2024 and consider buying one of these AI stocks instead.

1. Intel: Delivering growth in multiple areas of its business

Intel investors haven't had it easy in recent years, with its stock down 35% since 2019. The company was once the biggest name in the chip market, dominating manufacturing and boasting a lucrative partnership with Apple as the leading chip supplier for its Macs. However, trouble keeping up with competitors like AMD and Nvidia caused Intel to fall behind and lose market share.

Yet, sometimes, the best test of a company is how it responds to challenges, and recent developments suggest Intel could come back strong in the coming years. The chipmaker has increased its market share in central processing units (CPUs) for three consecutive quarters. Since the fourth quarter of 2023, Intel's CPU share has risen from 61% to 64%, while AMD's has fallen from 36% to 33%.

Moreover, recent earnings from Intel further highlight its gradual improvements. In Q1 2024, the company's revenue increased by 9% year over year to $13 billion. The company benefited from a 31% rise in client revenue, representing a spike in consumer sales. Meanwhile, its data center and AI segment posted revenue gains of 5%, with operating income hitting $184 million after the company reported losses of $69 million the year before.

Story continues

Intel is restructuring all areas of its business to prioritize long-term profit growth. The company is refocusing its business model around AI and manufacturing, with plans to build at least four plants in the U.S. and more abroad. Intel wants to become the country's leading AI chip manufacturer, which could allow it to profit from rising GPU demand throughout the industry.

With positive signs of growth and a bargain stock price, it's worth considering Intel stock over AMD in 2024.

2. Alphabet: The best-valued way to invest in AI software

Alphabet is home to some of the most widely recognized brands thanks to products like Android, YouTube, and the many offerings under Google. Alphabet's success has made it the world's fourth most valuable company, with a market cap above $2 trillion.

GOOGL Chart

The tech giant has proven itself as one of the most reliable long-term investments. This year alone, Alphabet has outperformed many of its rivals in stock growth (as seen in the chart above). Yet, it has the lowest P/E out of these companies, indicating it is trading at the best value. Furthermore, Alphabet has the lowest stock price among these tech companies, potentially making its shares the most accessible.

In addition to trading at a bargain, Alphabet has significant potential in AI. The company was an early investor in the industry, first introducing AI to its search engine in 2001. Then, in 2016, the tech giant became an AI-first company, well ahead of many of its rivals. Its Google DeepMind AI research subsidiary is driving the company's innovation.

Meanwhile, Alphabet's recently launched AI model, Gemini, could elevate its entire position in the industry by bringing generative upgrades across its product lineup.

Alphabet likely has a bright future in tech and is just too good to pass up at its current price point, making it a screaming buy in 2024 and a better option than AMD.

The chart of the day

What we're watching

What we're reading

Economic data releases and earnings

In the first half of 2024, stocks leapfrogged the wall of worry to deliver another solid set of six-month returns, leading the S&P 500 (^GSPC) to a respectable 14.5% gain and the Nasdaq Composite (^IXIC) to an even loftier 18% win.

If history is a guide, stock seasonality still favors the bulls in July. In fact, the Nasdaq has closed green in 10 of the past 11 Julys.

This bullishness extends into full-year results as well.

Looking back to 1928, there have been 29 years when the S&P 500 was up 10% or more at the halfway mark. By year-end, the average gain was 24%.

S&P 500 Monthly Returns When January to June Up More Than 10%

In each of the prior 12 instances of strong starts to the year going back to 1988, the second half of the year closed positive.

And across all years in the group going back to 1928, the second and third quarters combined were up an average 6.1% (9.6% median) — and were green 76% of the time.

Amid all these bullish results, two October stock market crashes — one in 1929 and one in 1987 — paved the way for the two worst-performing second halves of the year in the set, down 21.7% and 18.7%, respectively.

While July sports a respectable 1.4% average return (2.3% median), the percentage of years with positive returns drops to 59% from 83% the month prior.

The monthly seasonal pattern turns from lackluster in August — with a 0.4% average gain and 52% loss rate — to outright negative average returns in September and October (though median results remain positive).

Finally, after three months of roughly sideways tendencies, bullish tailwinds reaccelerate from November into year-end — just in time for the Santa Claus rally.

In general, historical seasonality patterns only account for up to a third of price returns. Big, unexpected catalysts can quickly tip the scales the other direction — so we can only outline tendencies. But it so happens that stock seasonality studies have generally worked well in this bull market, despite the AI moment seeming sui generis.

S&P 500 Seasonality — 1928 to 2023 First 10 Days and Last 10 Days of Each Month

Separately, BofA studied the first and last 10 trading days of each month going back to 1928 and found that the beginning of July has the highest average of any period (up 1.5% with positive results 69% of the time), another pattern to watch for this month.

Putting it all together, we might expect some more strength in early July before the traditional election market patterns take over.

The best dividend-paying companies have steady earnings growth, and in turn, they increase their payouts to shareholders. The elite among them eventually may earn entry into the category of Dividend Kings -- companies that have raised their payouts annually for at least 50 consecutive years.

In addition to being a Dividend King, PepsiCo (NASDAQ: PEP) has a yield of 3.3% at its current share price -- high relative to the average yield of 1.3% for the S&P 500. It also has a fairly recession-resistant business, which makes it exactly the kind of consistent company that many risk-averse income investors look for.

Pepsi is a top-tier dividend stock and a familiar name to most consumers, but the less widely known Illinois Tool Works (NYSE: ITW) may be an even better Dividend King to buy now.

Image source: Getty Images.

Getting to know ITW

Illinois Tool Works, which also goes by ITW, is a global industrial conglomerate with a diversified product portfolio spanning several industries. The company mainly sells products to businesses, so it would be understandable if you were unfamiliar with many of its brands.

It doesn't make massive earth-moving equipment or highly complex machinery. Rather, many of its products act as role players in larger systems. Here's a breakdown of its segments and some product examples.

Segment Product Examples 2023 Revenue 2023 Operating Margin Automotive Fasteners, interior and exterior components, powertrain components $3.2 billion 17% Test & Measurement and Electronics Laboratory testing and assembly equipment, accessories, consumables, aftermarket parts and services $2.8 billion 24% Food Equipment Advanced warewash, services, equipment for cooking, refrigeration, and food processing $2.6 billion 27% Construction Products Fasting solutions, complementary fasteners and accessories, construction design and engineering software $2 billion 28% Welding Welding equipment, specialty consumables, safety solutions $1.9 billion 32% Polymers & Fluids Engineered adhesives, sealants, coatings, lubricants, additives, automotive wiper blades, cleaners $1.8 billion 27% Specialty Products Zippers and six-pack rings for packaged goods, medical device products, aircraft ground support equipment, coating and metalizing businesses for product branding and national security markets $1.7 billion 27%

Data source: Illinois Tool Works.

One thing that separates ITW from other industrial conglomerates is that none of its seven segments dominate its revenue mix. And aside from automotive -- which has been struggling in North America but growing rapidly in China -- all of its segments have excellent operating margins. The overall business notched an operating margin of more than 25% in 2023.

Story continues

Management is projectng for an even better 26% to 27% operating margin in 2024 and a 30% operating margin by 2030.

Growth concerns

ITW's main challenge has been sluggish organic growth. Its organic revenue actually declined 0.6% last quarter. ITW is forecasting for just 1% to 3% organic growth for the year and 2% to 4% revenue growth. Earnings per share (EPS) growth is expected to be a little better at 6% to 10% for a total of $10.30 to $10.70 in full-year EPS -- partially thanks to a one-off accounting change.

Zoom out a bit further, and you'll see that ITW's EPS only increased by 20.6% during the past three years. That's not a terrible growth rate for a stodgy dividend payer, but it's not exactly great, either. Revenue has grown even slower, at 14.7%. However, take a look at an even longer time frame, and you'll notice that its earnings have grown much faster than revenue -- which is a testament to ITW becoming a more efficient, higher-margin business.

ITW EPS Diluted (TTM) Chart

A leaner business with widening margins is better than an overextended model that leans heavily on sales growth at the expense of margins. But eventually, ITW will need to chart a path toward both wider margins and higher revenue, especially because there's a limit to how many efficiency improvements a business can make.

If you tune in to a typical ITW earnings call, you'll find that most of the conversation centers around margins. It might seem trivial to go back and forth about a single percentage point in margins. But ITW generated $16.1 billion in trailing 12-month revenue and $4.2 billion in operating income -- so each percentage point change in margin equates to a $160 million difference in operating income.

Since ITW is involved in so many different industries (and generates a significant amount of sales from outside North America), no company is an exact competitor. However, some companies compete with it in one or more segments. And ITW has significantly higher margins than many of these peers.

ITW Operating Margin (TTM) Chart

Despite having lower revenue than Genuine Parts, Parker Hannifin, W.W. Grainger, and Emerson Electric, ITW has the highest operating income of any company on this list. What makes it such a special company is that it combines size with wide margins across many different product categories. Conglomerates can often be bulky and inefficient, but ITW is a good example of an effective conglomerate that is benefiting from diversification.

Expect a dividend raise soon

Last August, ITW announced a 7% dividend hike to $1.40 per share per quarter. ITW typically announces its annual payout raises in the summer, with the first affected payout coming in October. Given the consistency of its dividend program, investors should expect an announcement sometime in the next couple of months.

Not all Dividend Kings use stock buybacks as a primary way to return capital to shareholders, but ITW plans to repurchase $1.5 billion of its shares this year. By comparison, it distributed $418 million in dividends last quarter -- or roughly $1.7 billion during the past year. So on the surface, ITW's 2.4% yield may not look super attractive, but its capital return program is much stronger when one factors in the buyback program.

High margins help ITW squeeze more profit from every dollar in revenue. But buying back stock reduces its share count, leading to higher earnings per share. During the past five years, it has reduced its shares outstanding by 7.8%, which has boosted EPS by 36.1% even as net income rose by 24.2%.

Buybacks have also helped keep a lid on ITW's valuation. The recent sell-off in the stock paired with steady earnings growth has dropped its price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio down to just 23.4 -- which is below its three-, five- and seven-year median P/E ratios. And ITW was trading above these key levels just a few months ago.

ITW PE Ratio Chart

ITW is a well-rounded buy

ITW is a phenomenal business, but its valuation was pricey, and its revenue growth is weak. Now that the stock has sold off, the conglomerate's only bad quality is its low sales growth.

There are nearly perfect businesses, but there's no such thing as a perfect stock. The best companies are usually expensive relative to their trailing or projected earnings, while bad companies trade at cheap levels for good reasons.

However, ITW is close to a perfect blue chip dividend stock. It is an extremely efficient business with high margins, an over 50-year track record of raising dividends, a sizable buyback program, and a reasonable valuation. The conglomerate model works well for ITW and helps the company offset much of the cyclicality of its various end markets.

Add it all up, and there's a lot to like about ITW as a top-tier Dividend King to buy and hold for years to come.

Yahoo Finance,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/2-stock-split-ai-stocks-084400291.html,2024-07-01,08:44:00 UTC,"2 Stock-Split AI Stocks to Buy Before They Soar 70% and 230%, According to Certain Wall Street Analysts","Semiconductor company Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA) completed a 10-for-1 stock split in June, and fellow chipmaker Broadcom (NASDAQ: AVGO) has a 10-for-1 stock split planned for July. Savvy investors have gravitated toward both stocks. A company's share price tends to increase about twice as fast as the S&P 500 (SNPINDEX: ^GSPC) during the year following a stock split announcement.

Indeed, certain Wall Street analysts see substantial upside in Nvidia and Broadcom.

Beth Kendig at the I/O Fund expects Nvidia to achieve a $10 trillion market capitalization by 2030. That forecast implies about 230% upside from its current market capitalization of $3 trillion.

Joseph Moore at Morgan Stanley has outlined a bull-case price target that values Broadcom at $2,292 per share by June 2025. That will change to $229.20 per share after the stock split. Either way, that forecast implies 70% upside from its current price of $1,605 per share.

Here's what investors should know about Nvidia and Broadcom.

Nvidia: The market leading in data center GPUs and AI chips

Nvidia graphics processing units (GPUs) are the gold standard in rendering realistic computer graphics and accelerating complex data center workloads like artificial intelligence (AI) applications. Nvidia also provides adjacent data center hardware, such as central processing units (CPUs) and networking equipment, as well as subscription software and services that support graphics and AI workflows.

Nvidia holds more than 95% market share in workstation graphics processors and more than 90% market share in data center GPUs. Additionally, regarding AI specifically, The Wall Street Journal recently reported that ""Nvidia's chips underpin all of the most advanced AI systems, giving the company a market share estimated at more than 80%."" Looking ahead, Nvidia is unlikely to lose its leadership position anytime soon because it has a durable competitive advantage in CUDA.

Nvidia CUDA is a programming model lets GPUs (originally designed for graphics applications) accelerate all sorts of data center computing tasks. The CUDA ecosystem comprises hundreds of software libraries (building blocks) that streamline model training and application development. No other chipmaker has a comparable ecosystem of supporting software. In other words, competitors not only need to overcome the superior performance of Nvidia hardware, but also the immense convenience afforded to developers by Nvidia software.

Nvidia reported blockbuster financial results in the first quarter. Revenue increased 262% to $26 billion and non-GAAP net income soared 461% to $6.12 per diluted share. Nvidia is set to maintain that momentum as the AI market grows. In fact, CFRA analyst Angelo Zino recently said Nvidia ""will be the most important company to our civilization over the next decade.""

Story continues

Additionally, rapid innovation should keep the company ahead of its peers. Nvidia Blackwell GPUs offer four times faster AI training and 30 times faster AI inferencing as compared to the previous Hopper generation. Rosenblatt analyst Han Mosesmann recently said, ""The new Blackwell GPU platform, which ramps up later in 2024, is likely the most ambitious project Silicon Valley has ever witnessed.""

Wall Street expects Nvidia to grow earnings per share at 33% annually over the next three to five years. That makes its current valuation of 68 times adjusted earnings look a little expensive, but not unreasonably so. Investors should be prepared to pay a premium if they want to own this stock.

Personally, I am skeptical about Nvidia achieving a $10 trillion market capitalization by 2030. I certainly believe it's possible, but many things would have to go right for the company. That said, I do believe Nvidia will beat the S&P 500 over the next three to five years, so patient investors should consider buying a small position today.

Broadcom: The market leader in ASICs and networking chips

Broadcom breaks its business into semiconductor solutions and infrastructure software. The company earns semiconductor solutions revenue by developing chips for wired and wireless networking, data center storage, and other end markets. Broadcom also develops application specific integrated circuits (ASICs), chips purpose-built for specialized use cases like artificial intelligence. Additionally, Broadcom earns infrastructure software revenue from cybersecurity, monitoring, and virtualization products.

Broadcom is the leading provider of ASICs with 35% market share, while its closest competitor Marvell Technology holds 12% market share. It is also the leader in networking and wireless chips. That puts Broadcom in a good position because AI adoption is driving demand for ASICs and networking chips. Analysts at Goldman Sachs recently wrote, ""Alongside Nvidia, we view Broadcom as a critical piece to the ongoing AI infrastructure build-out.""

Broadcom reported solid financial results in the second quarter, beating estimates on the top and bottom lines. Revenue surged 43% to $12.5 billion on particularly strong demand for AI chips and virtualization software. Meanwhile, GAAP net income declined 46% to $4.42 per diluted share, but that was due to costs associated with its 2023 acquisition of VMware. Non-GAAP operating income increased 32% during the second quarter.

Broadcom is a hidden gem among AI stocks because Nvidia casts a long shadow. But its strong position in ASICs and networking chips should be a source of momentous revenue growth in the coming years. Indeed, management expects AI chips to account for 25% of its semiconductor solutions revenue in 2025, up from 15% in 2023.

However, Wall Street expects the company to grow earnings per share at 17% annually over the next three to five years. That makes its current valuation of 69 times earnings look expensive, especially when the three-year average is 32 times earnings. To be fair, earnings may grow more quickly than anticipated depending on how the VMware integration progresses. But I plan to avoid the stock until the valuation appears more reasonable. To that end, I see little chance of an 70% return over the next 12 months.

Yahoo Finance,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/56-54-450-000-income-150445914.html,2024-07-01,15:04:45 UTC,"We Are 56 & 54 With $450,000 Income And $5.1 Million Portfolio, But Live In A Pricey Area With Our 14-Year-Old: Can We Retire Now?","We Are 56 & 54 With $450,000 Income And $5.1 Million Portfolio, But Live In A Pricey Area With Our 14-Year-Old: Can We Retire Now?

On Bogleheads.org, a post titled ""Let me retire! Please?"" sparked a discussion about early retirement viability.

A couple from Pennsylvania, aged 56 and 54, is contemplating quitting their high-paying jobs to pursue volunteer activities. With a 14-year-old child, the couple seeks advice on whether their financial situation can support a sustainable retirement in a high-cost-of-living (HCOL) area.

Don't Miss:

The couple has a combined income of $450,000 in 2024 and expects to spend $180,000 annually post-2025. They have an effective federal tax rate of 24% and a state tax rate of 3.07%. Their total portfolio is $5.1 million, and they allocated 55% to stocks (20% international), 30% to bonds, and 15% to cash. They are primarily invested in Vanguard and Schwab funds with an expense ratio of 0.10%. They have no debt or mortgage, and their projected Social Security benefits are $35,000 for him at age 70 and $19,000 for her at age 62.

Several forum members provided their perspectives on the couple's retirement plan. The consensus is optimistic, with some variations in opinion on portfolio risk and spending flexibility.

One user noted, ""As long as your expenses are accurate, you should be fine. You are a touch on the conservative side with your investments, but you would likely be fine even without Social Security, providing a buffer for you."" Applying the 4% rule, which suggests a safe withdrawal rate of 4% of the portfolio, the couple could potentially withdraw $204,000 annually. This aligns well with their predicted spending of $180,000, leaving some room for unexpected expenses or market downturns.

Another user asked, ""What is the breakout of your portfolio (401(k), brokerage, Roth, etc.)? How much help do you intend to give your 14-year-old for college and later?"" Clarifications were requested regarding the breakdown of their portfolio and college funding plans for their child.

Trending: This Jeff Bezos-backed startup will allow you to become a landlord in just 10 minutes, and you only need $100.

Some forum members noted that the couple's current 55/45 asset allocation is somewhat conservative but within a safe range. One member suggested, ""I would therefore also suggest that you up your equities from 55% to 60%. Move that money from bonds to equities, not cash to equities.""

Story continues

The 4% rule, while a good guideline, may need adjustments given the couple's early retirement age and long retirement horizon. Another member commented, ""A 3.5% withdrawal rate is nearly guaranteed to last you 30 years with that asset allocation.""

The couple needs to remain flexible with their spending, especially in response to market fluctuations. One user advised, ""Make yourself a ‘retirement spending' list. This can be quite different from ‘while working.'""

Health care costs could increase significantly before Medicare kicks in. Another user asked, ""Have you researched costs when you're both on Medicare?""

Trending: Elon Musk and Jeff Bezos are bullish on one city that could dethrone New York and become the new financial capital of the US. Investing in its booming real estate market has never been more accessible.

It's important to understand these expenses and factor them into the retirement budget. College expenses for their child should also be planned for, ensuring they don't derail their retirement plans. Exploring Roth conversions and understanding ACA subsidies until Medicare eligibility could provide additional tax advantages and cost savings.

The couple appears well-positioned for early retirement, provided they maintain flexibility in their spending and remain vigilant about potential market changes. Their financial situation allows for a comfortable retirement, but ongoing assessment and potential adjustments to their portfolio and spending will be crucial for long-term success.

Would you feel confident about retiring now if you were in their shoes?

If you're uncertain about your early retirement plans or think you may need to address specific financial goals, consider consulting a financial advisor. They can help create a personalized plan tailored to your unique situation.

Yahoo Finance,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/nikes-stock-crashes-just-buy-092000325.html,2024-07-02,09:20:00 UTC,Nike's Stock Crashes. Just Do It and Buy the Dip?,"Nike's (NYSE: NKE) stock sank 20% to a four-year low on June 28 after the company posted its latest earnings report. For the fourth quarter of fiscal 2024, which ended on May 31, the footwear and athletic apparel maker's revenue dipped 2% year over year (and stayed flat in currency neutral terms) to $12.6 billion and missed analysts' expectations by $250 million. Its diluted EPS rose 50% to $0.99 and cleared the consensus forecast by $0.15 per share.

Did the market overreact to that top-line miss? Let's review Nike's recent challenges, its future expectations, and its valuation to see if investors should buy its post-earnings dip.

Image source: Nike.

Nike's revenue growth has flatlined

In fiscal 2023, Nike's revenue rose 16% on a currency neutral basis. Most of that growth was driven by its Nike Direct direct-to-consumer segment, which boosted its revenue 20% on a currency neutral basis and accounted for 42% of its top line.

But in fiscal 2024, the company's revenue only ticked up 1% on a currency neutral basis as Nike Direct's sales climbed just 1%. Nike Direct's year-over-year revenue growth also flatlined in the third quarter and actually declined in Q4. As a result, its total sales growth stalled out over the past three quarters.

Metric Q4 2023 Q1 2024 Q2 2024 Q3 2024 Q4 2024 Nike Direct revenue growth (YOY) 18% 2% 4% 0% (7%) Total revenue growth (YOY) 8% 6% (1%) 0% 0%

Data source: Nike. Currency neutral basis. YOY = year over year.

Nike blamed that deceleration on macro headwinds for its lower-end consumers, weak brick-and-mortar sales in China, uneven demand across the EMEA (Europe, Middle East, and Africa) region, and soft demand for some of its classic footwear franchises. The strong dollar, which shaved 2 percentage points off its reported revenue growth in the fourth quarter, will likely exacerbate that pressure for at least a few more quarters.

Nike expects that slowdown to deepen, with a mid-single-digit decline in its reported revenue for fiscal 2025, which widely missed analysts' expectations for 1.5% growth.

But as Nike stalls, many of its competitors are thriving and expanding. Analysts expect its Swiss rival On (NYSE: ONON) to generate 29% sales growth this year. Lululemon (NASDAQ: LULU), which is selling more shoes as it expands beyond yoga and athleisure apparel, is projected to see revenue rise 12% this year.

During Nike's conference call, CEO John Donahoe said fiscal 2025 would be a ""transition year,"" in which it kicks off a ""multiyear innovation cycle"" and invests in more ""consumer-facing activities"" to strengthen its brand. Unfortunately, Nike's post-earnings plunge suggests that investors aren't too bullish about its turnaround plans yet.

Story continues

But its margins are stabilizing

On the bright side, Nike's gross margin rose 110 basis points to 44.6% in fiscal 2024. That expansion was driven by lower freight and logistics costs, as well as price hikes for some of its premium products. It expects those tailwinds to boost its gross margin by 10 to 30 basis points in fiscal 2025.

Those rising margins indicate that Nike still has a lot of pricing power, and that it can offset promotional sales of lower-margin value products with stronger sales of higher-margin premium products. That said, On and Lululemon still reported much higher gross margins of 59.7% and 57.7%, respectively, in their latest quarters.

Nike laid off about 2% of its workforce this year, and it could continue trimming costs to squeeze more profits from stagnant sales. But reining in spending too aggressively could inadvertently cripple the company's turnaround strategies.

Nike didn't provide earnings guidance for the full year, but analysts were previously bracing for a 2% earnings decline. Based on that forecast -- which will likely be reduced after its gloomy revenue outlook -- shares trade at 25 times forward earnings. I'd expect that multiple to rise over the next few weeks as analysts' cut their earnings estimates.

Nike probably won't attract too many bidders when it's easy to find faster-growing companies with lower valuations. Lululemon, which is expected to increase its earnings by 12% this year, trades at just 21 times forward earnings.

Just don't buy Nike (for now)

It might be tempting to buy Nike's stock after its latest decline, but I wouldn't touch it until the company proves that its challenges are merely cyclical instead of existential. Nike Direct's slowdown is worrisome, and it seems to be struggling against resilient niche competitors like On in certain regions. Unless Nike gets it act together over the next few quarters, the stock will likely head even lower as investors pivot toward higher-growth competitors.

Along with summer demand hopes, the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries and its allies' (OPEC+) decision to extend most of its oil output cuts triggered hedge funds to build up their oil positions in June.

The energy sector saw high buying volume last month and climbed alongside Brent crude oil, according to Goldman Sachs. However, investors may want to hold off on at least two oil and gas stocks in July: Exxon Mobil Corp (NYSE:XOM) and Marathon Oil Corp (NYSE:MRO).

XOM finished July lower in nine out of the last 10 years, with an average 1.8% loss. The security could be in the middle of a pattern of lower highs since its April 12 record high of $123.75, with familiar pressure now lingering at the $120 level, which rejected April and May rallies. The equity is up 14.9% so far this year, but was last seen down 0.2% to trade at $114.89.

Meanwhile, Marathon Oil stock finished the month lower 60% of the time over the last decade, with an average 3% drop. The security fell after hitting an April 12, 52-week high of $30.06, and is now running into pressure at $29.

Yahoo Finance,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/2-artificial-intelligence-ai-stocks-220000723.html,2024-07-01,22:00:00 UTC,2 Artificial Intelligence (AI) Stocks Trading Under $30 That Can Supercharge Your Portfolio,"Semiconductor giant Nvidia has added $2.6 trillion to its market capitalization since the beginning of 2023, soaking up most of the value created by the artificial intelligence (AI) industry so far.

However, professional investor Cathie Wood believes software companies will eventually generate $8 in revenue for every $1 spent on chips from the likes of Nvidia, which could create a substantial opportunity for investors.

C3.ai (NYSE: AI) and Lemonade (NYSE: LMND) were developing AI software long before the hype took hold last year. Shares in both companies trade at under $30; here's why they could supercharge your stock portfolio over the long term.

1. C3.ai

C3.ai was the world's first enterprise AI company when it was founded in 2009. It now has a portfolio of more than 40 ready-made and customizable AI applications used by businesses in 19 different industries, which helps them reap the benefits of the technology without having to build it from the ground up themselves.

Dow is a chemical manufacturing giant that uses C3.ai's applications for predictive maintenance. AI monitors Dow's equipment to calculate the probability of a failure, allowing engineers to remedy any issues before they become critical. Dow says C3.ai has reduced its downtime by 20%, which directly impacts production volume, revenue, and profitability.

Similarly, Georgia Pacific (which manufactures paper, packaging, and building materials) has rolled out C3.ai's Reliability platform to monitor over 200 large production assets, with plans to expand the partnership further. Georgia Pacific has already seen a 5% increase in equipment efficiency, and management says employees now spend 80% of their time solving problems rather than looking for them.

C3.ai sells its applications directly to businesses, but it also sells them through its extensive partnership network which includes all major cloud platforms like Microsoft Azure and Amazon Web Services. Those partners offer C3.ai's applications to their customers to give them more AI options, and C3.ai gets the benefit of accessing a much larger pool of businesses.

In the recent fiscal 2024 fourth quarter (ended April 30), C3.ai had 487 customer engagements, which was a whopping 70% increase from the year-ago period, highlighting the fast-growing demand for AI in the corporate world. The company's revenue hit a record high of $86.6 million during the quarter, marking a 20% increase, its fastest growth in almost two years. According to management's forecast, revenue growth could accelerate further to 23% in the upcoming fiscal 2025 first quarter (ending July 31).

Story continues

C3.ai trades at $28.55 per share as of the close on June 27, which is an 82% discount to its all-time high from the 2020 tech frenzy. Its valuation was completely unreasonable back then, but the company has grown consistently ever since, with more customers and an expanding product portfolio. Now might be a great time to buy in.

2. Lemonade

Lemonade has developed AI since it was founded in 2015 with an aim to disrupt the insurance industry, which is dominated by large, entrenched companies. Lemonade uses AI across its entire business; it autonomously writes quotes, pays claims, calculates premiums, and even identifies areas where the company is underperforming.

Lemonade's AI chatbot, Maya, can write quotes for potential customers in under 90 seconds via the company's website. Its AI bot, Jim, can pay claims in under three minutes without human assistance. That speedy, tech-centric approach to service helped Lemonade attract over 2 million customers so far, and it's successfully acquiring younger cohorts in the 19 to 34 age bracket, which have historically been underinsured.

Internally, Lemonade's Lifetime Value (LTV) AI models use swaths of data to calculate a customer's likelihood of making a claim, switching insurers, and buying multiple policies, to ensure it charges the most accurate premium.

Plus, those models help reduce costs. The company's loss-adjusted expense (LAE) ratio — which measures the cost of managing claims — is 7.6%, whereas 10% is typical across the industry. In fact, Lemonade's insurance book has grown 22% over the past year at the same time the company shrank its workforce by 11%, which highlights the power of AI.

During the first quarter of 2024 (ended March 31), Lemonade's in-force premiums (the total value of all active policies) hit a record high of $794 million, representing an increase of 21.5% from the year-ago period. Its gross loss ratio (the percentage of its premiums paid out as claims) also fell eight percentage points to 79% and is now in the ballpark of the company's long-term target of 75%.

Those metrics resulted in a record $119.1 million in revenue during Q1, up 25% from the year-ago period. Lemonade is still generating losses at the bottom line, but they are shrinking, and management expects the company to be cash-flow positive by the end of this year. However, pulling back on expenses could lead to slower revenue growth and delay an expansion beyond its five existing segments: renters, homeowners, life, pet, and car insurance.

Nevertheless, reaching profitability will be a key milestone that could give investors confidence in Lemonade's ability to operate a thriving, sustainable business over the long term. Its stock closed at $16.46 on June 27, which was an 89% discount to its all-time high. Like C3.ai, Lemonade was swept up in the tech frenzy during 2021, and its valuation soared to unsustainable heights. With the company making clear progress since then, the steep drop could be a great opportunity to buy the stock.

Prices weren't too far from those levels on Monday, as Brent (BZ=F) hovered above $86 per barrel while West Texas Intermediate (CL=F) topped $82 per barrel.

""The biggest fear in the market is the biggest geopolitical tension that we’re seeing in the Middle East,"" Andy Lipow, president of Lipow Oil Associates, told Yahoo Finance on Monday.

Escalating tensions between Israel and Lebanon's Hezbollah militia, backed by Iran, have raised concerns that a cross-border conflict could eventually involve Tehran more directly. Iran is responsible for about 3 million barrels of oil production per day, or about 3% of the world's output.

""That’s the oil markets' concern because that could spread to interrupting supplies throughout the Persian Gulf region,"" said Lipow. ""Between that as well as increasing demand from now through the end of the year, I’m expecting Brent crude oil prices to drift up to about $90 per barrel.""

Rising demand has also lifted crude prices in recent weeks. Last month, US crude gained 6%.

""The latest strength in prices has been attributed to shrinking crude and product inventories with higher road traffic demand as well as jet travel,"" Dennis Kissler, senior vice president at BOK Financial, said in a recent note.

""Hotter temps thru most of the US has also been a demand positive for power generation,"" he added.

Wall Street widely predicts slowing demand amid greater supply will send prices lower next year, with JPMorgan analysts predicting Brent to average $75 in 2025, sharply down from $83 in 2024.

Goldman Sachs has kept its target for next year unchanged at an average of $82 per barrel.

Yahoo Finance,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/buy-nvidia-stock-hand-over-095000188.html,2024-07-02,09:50:00 UTC,Should You Buy Nvidia Stock Hand Over Fist After Its Post-Stock-Split Pullback?,"Most investors would be happy with a stock that doubled in five years. They'd likely be ecstatic about a stock that tripled during the same period. Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA) has skyrocketed more than 30x over the last five years. I'm unsure what emotion adequately describes how investors feel about this phenomenal return.

Some expected Nvidia's remarkable momentum to accelerate after the company's 10-for-1 stock split conducted following the market close on June 7. And it did -- for a few days. However, shares have since fallen and are now down close to 8% from their high. So should you buy Nvidia after its post-stock-split pullback?

The beginning of a big slide or a temporary dip?

No one ever knows for sure when a stock declines if it's the beginning of a major extended downturn or only a short, temporary dip. That's true with Nvidia in this case.

However, it's important to note that there hasn't been any bad news for Nvidia to cause its share price to fall. A few analysts have raised their price targets for the stock. For example, Truist now looks for Nvidia's share price to hit $140 over the next 12 months, up from its previous target of $128.80. Cantor Fitzgerald is even more bullish, raising its price target for Nvidia to $175 from $140.

So why has Nvidia's share price retreated somewhat? Part of the decline could be due to some investors taking profits. But some are also concerned about Nvidia's valuation.

The stock trades at over 47 times forward earnings. This multiple implies expectations of huge growth. Any hiccup with the company would likely cause Nvidia's stock to fall significantly more than it already has.

Why Nvidia should bounce back

That said, I think that Nvidia's recent decline is only a temporary dip. For one thing, there's no reason to be more concerned about the company's valuation now than there was before its stock split.

More importantly, Nvidia will soon launch its new Blackwell graphics processing unit (GPU) platform. CEO Jensen Huang said at Nvidia's shareholder meeting on June 26, ""The Blackwell architecture platform will likely be the most successful product in our history."" I suspect he'll be proven right.

Blackwell can run large language models (LLMs) at up to 25 times less cost and energy consumption than Nvidia's Hopper GPUs. This is critical because energy costs for running these AI models can be significant.

Huang also said that Blackwell could be the most successful product in the history of computing. I'm not so sure about this prediction. However, I'm confident that Blackwell will keep Nvidia at the top of the artificial intelligence (AI) chip market. I also expect Nvidia will deliver impressive quarterly results in late 2024 and throughout 2025.

Story continues

Buy Nvidia stock hand over fist?

With the post-split pullback likely to be only temporary, should you buy Nvidia stock hand over fist? Not necessarily.

Your investing style is a big factor in deciding whether to buy Nvidia's shares. Income investors will almost certainly want to look elsewhere. Although Nvidia pays a dividend, its forward yield is a minuscule 0.032%. I think risk-averse investors can find better alternatives, too.

However, aggressive growth investors should still like Nvidia. There are no signs the AI boom is waning. Nvidia continues to dominate the AI chip market. I don't view Nvidia as the hand-over-fist buy that it has been in the past, but the stock could still have plenty of room to run.

Most Read from Bloomberg

The Stoxx Europe 600 benchmark dropped about 0.5%, led by the construction and materials sector and car makers. France’s CAC 40 underperformed, paring some of Monday’s gains, as the country prepares for a second election round. US equity futures slipped.

While inflation likely slowed further in June, the data won’t provide answers to the European Central Bank’s lingering questions on underlying price pressures, according to Chief Economist Philip Lane. He joined President Christine Lagarde and Vice President Luis de Guindos in signaling that another rate cut in July is unlikely as the ECB collects evidence inflation is heading toward its 2% target.

Meanwhile, the 10-year Treasury yield pared some of Monday’s rise on speculation that a Donald Trump presidency would lead to greater US fiscal deficits and higher inflation. A gauge of the dollar headed higher for a second day.

“The dollar is being supported by the jump in US Treasury yields overnight,” David Forrester, a senior strategist at Credit Agricole CIB, said. “The irony is that it is investor concerns about US fiscal sustainability that is driving US Treasury yields higher.”

Treasuries have been whipsawed this year as traders swung between buying bonds amid signs of cooling US prices and fears of higher-for-longer rates. Yields on five-year securities have climbed more than 20 basis points from a low of about 4.20% just under three weeks ago.

After last week’s debate hurt Joe Biden’s chances of winning reelection, Wall Street strategists — including ones from Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Morgan Stanley and Barclays Plc. — are taking a fresh look at how a Trump victory could play out in the bond market. They’re urging clients to position for sticky inflation and higher long-term yields.

Strategists at JPMorgan Chase & Co., on the other hand, said it’s now time to pocket profits on Treasuries.

Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell’s speech at an ECB forum in Portugal may provide more clues on the outlook for policy. The ECB’s Lagarde is also scheduled to speak. Traders will also eye data on US job openings later Tuesday.

Asian shares gain

Asian shares increased, led by gains in Japan and Hong Kong. The MSCI AC Asia Pacific Index hit its highest since late May amid a rally in Hong Kong-listed property and electric vehicle maker shares.

Japan’s equity benchmark inched closer to a record high, supported by gains for financial stocks on prospects of higher lending rates. Domestic 10-year yields continued their rise above 1% on bets that the central bank will raise policy rates.

In China, pessimism about the domestic economy has sparked a surge in demand for government debt. The central bank said it will borrow government bonds from primary dealers, a sign it may be contemplating selling securities to cool down the rally.

The yield on China’s benchmark bonds fell to a record low on Monday as investors worry about the long-term economic growth.

In commodities, oil traded near a two-month high on an escalation in tensions in the Middle East and concerns over the rapid start to the Atlantic hurricane season. Iron ore held near the highest close in about a month. Gold was little changed.

Yahoo Finance,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/want-decades-passive-income-2-113700915.html,2024-07-01,11:37:00 UTC,Want Decades of Passive Income? 2 Top Dividend Stocks to Buy Now and Hold Forever.,"There's something quite pleasant about having cash deposited into your investment account quarter after quarter and year after year. Here are two outstanding dividend stocks with long histories of rewarding their shareholders with steadily rising cash payments. Both stocks can help you build your own streams of passive income.

Top dividend stock No. 1: Lockheed Martin

Lockheed Martin (NYSE: LMT) helps the U.S. government and its allies protect their citizens from a growing number of threats. The company is a vital ally in an increasingly volatile world.

As a leading defense contractor, Lockheed supplies crucial technology to the U.S. military. Here are just a few examples:

The F-35 stealth aircraft serves a crucial role in the security strategies of the Air Force, Navy, and Marines, as well as that of 18 allied nations.

The Aegis radar system is helping U.S. forces protect merchant shipping vessels from drone and missile attacks in the Red Sea.

Patriot-launched PAC-3 interceptors are enabling Ukraine to fend off Russia's aerial bombardments.

Lockheed has amassed $159 billion worth of orders for its broad array of defensive platforms. Combined with the long service lives of its key products -- the F-35, for one, is expected to remain in service until at least 2080 -- this massive backlog gives investors a high degree of visibility into the company's future cash flow.

Management is committed to passing much of this cash on to shareholders via stock buybacks and a steadily rising dividend. Over the past decade, Lockheed has bought back a quarter of its shares, which has boosted per-share profits for its remaining stockholders. The defense leader has also raised its cash payout for 21 straight years. Today, Lockheed's dividend yield is a solid 2.7%.

Top dividend stock No. 2: Eli Lilly

For more than 140 years, Eli Lilly (NYSE: LLY) has used cutting-edge science to help people live better. The healthcare leader's history is chock-full of medical breakthroughs, but its latest discovery could be the most impactful and profitable one yet.

Almost 70% of American adults are obese or overweight, which can lead to life-threatening illnesses like diabetes, heart disease, and strokes. Fortunately, Eli Lilly has developed a game-changing drug that makes it easier for people to lose weight.

Zepbound, the pharmaceutical pioneer's weight-management treatment for adults, activates hormone receptors that reduce appetite. Participants in a 72-week clinical trial who received the highest dose of the drug lost 48 pounds on average.

Story continues

When combined with diet and exercise, Zepbound also helped these people improve their cholesterol and blood pressure profiles. And tirzepatide, the active ingredient in Zepbound, can make it easier for adults with type 2 diabetes to control their blood sugar levels. Better still, recent studies suggest that tirzepatide could have positive effects for people with liver disease and sleep apnea.

Due to tirzepatide's many potential health benefits, CEO Dave Ricks believes it will be the most important medicine of his 28-year career. Wall Street seems to agree. Investment bank Goldman Sachs expects Eli Lilly to be a leader in an anti-obesity drug market that will soar to $130 billion by the end of the decade. The company's profits, in turn, are projected to increase by more than 60% annually over the next five years.

Yahoo Finance,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/much-energy-transfer-pay-dividends-123400033.html,2024-07-01,12:34:00 UTC,How Much Will Energy Transfer Pay Out in Dividends This Year?,"Energy Transfer (NYSE: ET) offers investors an enticing income stream. The master limited partnership's (MLP) distribution yield is around 8%. That's several times above the S&P 500's 1.3% dividend yield.

Here's a closer look at how much money the MLP will distribute to its investors this year.

Drilling down into Energy Transfer's distribution payment

Energy Transfer pays its investors a quarterly distribution of $0.3175 per unit ($1.27 annualized). The MLP had about 3.4 billion outstanding common units at the end of the first quarter. That put its total cash outlay at nearly $1.1 billion in the period. At that rate, the MLP will distribute a little less than $4.3 billion in cash to its unitholders in 2024.

The total payment will likely be a little bit higher than that this year. Energy Transfer has pledged to increase its distribution per unit by 3% to 5% each year, with modest raises coming each quarter. On top of that, the company agreed to buy WTG Midstream in a nearly $3.3 billion deal, partially funded by issuing 50.8 million new common units. The combination of a growing distribution per unit and an increase in its total outstanding units will likely push its distribution level above $4.3 billion for the full year.

Energy Transfer can easily afford to cover that level of cash distributions. It produced nearly $2.4 billion in distributable cash flow in the first quarter and should generate about $7.5 billion for the full year. That's enough to cover its distribution and fund its expansion projects (about $2.9 billion) with room to spare.

A well-oiled income-producing machine

Energy Transfer pays a very lucrative distribution to its investors. The MLP can easily cover its payout with its massive cash flow. It has plenty left over to fund its growth, giving it the fuel to increase its already enormous payout. These features make it an attractive option for those seeking an above-average and steadily rising income stream.

Yahoo Finance,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/buy-broadcom-stock-hand-over-094900953.html,2024-07-01,09:49:00 UTC,Should You Buy Broadcom Stock Hand Over Fist Before Its 10-for-1 Stock Split?,"Broadcom's (NASDAQ: AVGO) share price nearly doubled last year. The stock is up over 45% so far in 2024. That's great news for shareholders. However, for some investors, this tremendous success pushed Broadcom's share price so high (over $1,600) that they were reluctant to buy.

That won't be a problem for too much longer. In its first-quarter update a few weeks ago, Broadcom announced plans for a 10-for-1 stock split after the market close on July 12, 2024. The semiconductor and software maker's shares will trade on a split-adjusted basis beginning July 15, 2024.

Broadcom CFO Kirsten Spears said the purpose of this stock split for ""to make ownership of Broadcom stock more accessible to investors and employees."" Some believe this greater accessibility could provide a nice catalyst for the already high-flying stock. Should you buy Broadcom stock hand over fist before its 10-for-1 stock split?

The case for Broadcom

Historically, stocks have jumped 25% during the 12 months following a stock split announcement, according to the Bank of America Research Investment Committee. Broadcom's shares have risen only around 8% since the announcement of its stock split, so it could still have plenty of room to run if history is a guide.

Are there reasons to buy Broadcom stock other than a potential stock split surge? Absolutely. I'd put the company's acquisition of VMware near the top of the list. This deal contributed significantly to Broadcom's revenue soaring 43% year over year in the second quarter of 2024. Earlier this year, Broadcom CEO Hock Tan said that the company expects VMWare's revenue growth will accelerate through the remainder of fiscal 2024.

However, the biggest reason to buy Broadcom stock is its artificial intelligence (AI) opportunity. Seven of the eight largest AI clusters in the world use Broadcom's Ethernet technology. Broadcom expects its networking revenue to jump 40% this year primarily due to AI-related demand.

The company's AI accelerator business is highly profitable. Creating networks to connect AI accelerators is complicated. But Broadcom is arguably the best at doing it. As Tan said in the Q2 earnings call, the company has ""the deepest and broadest understanding of what it takes for complex large workloads to be scaled out in an AI fabric.""

Broadcom is also a free cash flow (FCF) machine. In Q2, the company generated FCF of $4.4 billion -- 36% of total revenue. If we exclude the cash Broadcom used for restructuring and integration, its FCF rose 18% year over year to $5.3 billion and made up 42% of revenue.

Story continues

The case against Broadcom

Despite the excitement about Broadcom's stock split, it won't change anything about the company's underlying business. Also, investors who wanted to buy the stock but were leery of its high share price could have done so with fractional shares.

Broadcom's growth story wouldn't be nearly as impressive without the VMWare deal. Excluding VMWare, Q2 revenue increased by only 12% year over year. The company won't be able to rely on the acquisition to boost its year-over-year numbers after Q4, since the transaction closed on Nov. 22, 2023.

Some parts of Broadcom's business remain weak. Wireless revenue in Q2 rose only 2% year over year. Server storage connectivity revenue fell 27%. Broadband revenue plunged 39%.

Just five customers generate roughly 40% of total sales. Apple alone makes up 17% of Broadcom's total revenue. This reliance on a small number of customers presents a key risk for Broadcom.

The company's AI opportunity is big. However, Nvidia could emerge as a strong competitor to Broadcom in Ethernet switching and custom AI accelerators.

There's also a potential valuation concern. Broadcom stock trades at nearly 34 times forward earnings and 16.7 times trailing 12-month sales.

Buy before the split?

I don't think investors should be in a rush to buy Broadcom stock before its stock split. My hunch is that the split will be largely a non-event rather than a major catalyst.

That said, Broadcom could remain a winner over the long term. Patient investors could buy now, wait until the stock split, or hold off for a pullback to buy on the dip. If you plan on owning Broadcom for 10 years or more, the exact timing of when you buy probably won't matter all that much.

Even though most brokerages now allow investors to buy fractional shares of those stocks, some investors might still prefer to buy round lots (100 shares) at lower prices because they're easier to keep track of.

To reach those smaller investors, a lot of companies split their stocks to make them easier to trade. These stock splits don't change the underlying value of the company, since they merely break a single share into smaller slices, but they can make it easier to trade options or fund employee stock-based compensation plans. They also tend to generate a lot of media buzz and attract fresh interest from short-term traders.

None of those factors should matter to long-term investors. But if we look at the fundamentals, I believe one of these stock-split stocks is worth buying right now -- while another one should be avoided.

The stock-split stock to buy: Chipotle Mexican Grill

Chipotle Mexican Grill (NYSE: CMG) executed a 50-for-1 stock split on June 26. That represented its first stock split since McDonald's spun off the fast-casual restaurant chain in an IPO in 2006.

Chipotle's stock price had more than doubled to nearly $3,300 in the three years leading up to its split, so it made sense to break up its shares into easier-to-trade slices. Yet I believe Chipotle's stock is still worth buying for three simple reasons.

First, it's still opening new stores. Its year-end store count rose from 2,768 in 2020 to 3,437 in 2023, and it plans to open 285 to 315 new locations this year. Second, its comparable store sales are rising -- so its new locations are sustainable, and it isn't merely driving its sales growth with new store openings. Lastly, its annual restaurant-level operating margins have expanded over the past three consecutive years as it raised its menu prices to offset the inflationary headwinds.

From 2020 to 2023, Chipotle's revenue grew at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 18% as its EPS increased at a CAGR of 53%. Looking ahead, it expects its rising digital orders (36.5% of its sales in its latest quarter), the stickiness of its loyalty program, installations of more drive-thru Chipotlanes, and its overseas expansion into Europe to fuel its long-term growth. Analysts expect its revenue and earnings to grow 15% and 23%, respectively, this year. It stock certainly isn't cheap at 58 times forward earnings, but I believe its impressive growth rates justify that premium valuation.

The stock-split stock to avoid: Sony

Sony (NYSE: SONY) plans to execute a 5-for-1 split for both its Tokyo-traded shares and New York-traded American Depository Receipts (ADRs) on Oct. 1. That will mark the Japanese conglomerate's first stock split in more than two decades.

Sony's revenue grew at a CAGR of 13% from fiscal 2020 to fiscal 2023 (which ended this March) in yen terms. That growth was largely driven by the expansion of its gaming, music, movies, and image chipmaking businesses.

But for U.S. investors, most of that growth was offset by the dollar's record rally against the yen. That's why Sony's Tokyo-listed shares rallied 29% in yen terms over the past three years -- but its U.S.-listed ADRs declined 15%. So unless the yen finally stabilizes against the dollar, I think it's still too risky to buy Sony's ADRs.

Even if we look past those currency headwinds, we'll notice that Sony's growth is slowing down. For fiscal 2024, it anticipates just 1% revenue growth (after excluding its upcoming divestment of its Financial Services division) in yen terms, as the expansion of its image chipmaking and music divisions only partly offsets the slower growth of its gaming and consumer electronics divisions. It expects its adjusted earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization (EBITDA) to only increase 6% for the year -- compared to its CAGR of 20% from fiscal 2020 to fiscal 2023.

Sony's ADR shares might seem historically cheap at just 17 times forward earnings and 9 times its adjusted EBITDA. But it could continue to trade at that discount as long as the yen keeps declining and its core growth engines fizzle out. So for now, a stock split won't solve any of those issues or make it a more appealing investment.

Yahoo Finance,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/meet-unstoppable-stock-just-joined-084900981.html,2024-07-02,08:49:00 UTC,"Meet the Unstoppable Stock That Just Joined Nvidia, Microsoft, Apple, and Alphabet by Topping $2 Trillion in Market Cap","Six American companies have a valuation of at least $1 trillion, and all of them operate in the technology industry. So far, five of them have graduated into the $2 trillion club or higher:

Microsoft is valued at $3.3 trillion. Apple is valued at $3.2 trillion. Nvidia is valued at $3 trillion. Alphabet is valued at $2.3 trillion. Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN) is valued at $2 trillion.

Amazon is the newest member, having crossed the $2 trillion threshold last week for the first time. The company generates more revenue than all of its peers on the above list, but that hasn't translated into a higher valuation because of its relatively modest profitability. Amazon's e-commerce business, for example, operates on razor-thin margins.

But the company is making changes that are driving substantial progress at the bottom line. Combined with its growing presence in artificial intelligence (AI), investors are clearly paying attention. Here's why $2 trillion probably won't be a stopping point for Amazon.

Amazon is in its AI era

Amazon was founded as an e-commerce company, and online sales are still its largest source of revenue. However, investors are keenly focused on its other businesses like streaming, digital advertising, and especially cloud computing. Amazon Web Services (AWS) is the world's largest cloud platform, and it's preparing to dominate the three core layers of AI.

At the bottom layer, AWS designed its own chips for both training and inferencing AI models, and they are growing in popularity because they can be up to 50% cheaper to use than some of its other infrastructure, which is powered by Nvidia's industry-leading hardware. Plus, they help AWS ease supply constraints other data center operators like Oracle (NYSE: ORCL) are grappling with.

Large language models (LLMs) make up the second layer. The AWS Bedrock platform offers developers an entire portfolio of ready-made LLMs they can use to accelerate the buildout of customer-facing applications like chatbots and virtual assistants. That portfolio includes a family of LLMs designed by Amazon itself, called Titan, in addition to LLMs from leading AI start-ups like Anthropic.

The application layer is third, and it includes completed AI software that is ready for integration into almost any business. The new Amazon Q virtual assistant is a good example, because it can analyze high volumes of data to identify potential revenue opportunities, and it can also analyze, debug, and write computer code to accelerate software development.

But Amazon's use of AI also extends to its legacy e-commerce business. It powers the recommendation engine on amazon.com to show customers products they are likely to buy, and the company also developed a suite of AI tools to help sellers craft more engaging product pages to boost sales.

Amazon generates more revenue than each of its peers

Amazon has generated $590 billion in trailing-12-month revenue, which is far more than any of its peers in the $2 trillion club:

AMZN Revenue (TTM) Chart

However, Amazon's price-to-sales (P/S) ratio -- which is calculated by dividing its valuation by its revenue -- is the cheapest of the bunch:

NVDA PS Ratio Chart

Simply put, investors haven't given Amazon full credit for both sides of its business. In the recent first quarter of 2024 (ended March 31), the AWS cloud platform contributed 61.5% of the company's entire operating profit despite accounting for just 17.5% of its total revenue.

Its e-commerce segment, on the other hand, has inflated revenue but often generates operating losses because Amazon charges low prices in order to sell a high volume of products. But the company is making efforts to improve profitability in that segment. Last year, it split its U.S. national fulfillment network into eight regions, so certain geographic locations can stock higher levels of inventory for the most popular products. This means products travel a shorter distance to reach customers, which reduces logistics costs.

By the end of 2023, Amazon's cost to serve (the cost of fulfilling orders) on a per-unit basis shrank globally for the first time since 2018. Plus, during Q1 this year, almost 60% of Prime members in Amazon's top 60 largest metro areas received their orders on the same day or the next day. Amazon CEO Andy Jassy says faster deliveries are prompting customers to order more frequently and spend more money, which is great for both revenue and profitability.

Strong contributions from both AWS and the e-commerce business sent Amazon's net income soaring to $10.4 billion in Q1 2024, an increase of 225% from the year-ago period. That's a key reason investors have piled into its stock lately.

$2 trillion probably won't be a stopping point for Amazon

Based on Amazon's trailing-12-month earnings per share of $3.57, its stock trades at a price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio of 54.1. The average P/E ratio of the other four stocks in the $2 trillion club is 42.9, which is why Amazon was so late to earn its membership despite its towering revenue (it looks expensive by comparison).

However, improving profitability will clear the way for Amazon stock to move higher. Wall Street expects the company to deliver $5.41 per share in earnings during 2025, which places its stock at a forward P/E ratio of 35.7. In other words, its stock would have to rise 20% by the end of next year just to trade in line with the current average P/E ratio of the rest of the $2 trillion club.

AI could add further fuel to Amazon's results. The company recently invested $4 billion in Anthropic, and as part of the deal, the start-up is making AWS its primary cloud provider. It also committed to using Amazon's chips to train its future models, which could entice other leading developers to try them. Finally, it will make those models available on AWS for customers to use, which could help the cloud platform win customers who might have selected competitors like Microsoft Azure instead.

In summary, investors with a time horizon of at least two years are getting a great deal on Amazon stock today, even though it recently set a new record high. But investors who set their sights on the longer term could earn greater rewards as AI unlocks more opportunities for the company.

Most Read from Bloomberg

But it turns out the US short-seller’s gains from the saga were tiny by comparison — just over $4 million.

That figure, which hasn’t been independently confirmed by Bloomberg News, was disclosed by Hindenburg in a statement on its website Monday. It’s the first time the New York-based firm, founded by Nathan Anderson, has provided a tally of its winnings from last year’s bombshell report alleging fraud and market manipulation at the Indian business empire of Gautam Adani — one of Asia’s richest tycoons.

The contrast between Hindenburg’s gains and the wider impact underscores how opportune research can have far-reaching effects, even if it’s not always easy to profit from the fallout. Shares and bonds of Adani Group companies swung wildly in the immediate aftermath of Hindenburg’s report but have since recovered ground. As of Monday, the group market value was $205 billion — about $30 billion short of its pre-Hindenburg level.

The scathing report earned a gross revenue of about $4.1 million through gains related to Adani shorts from “one investor relationship” — Hindenburg didn’t name who — and about “$31,000 through our own short of Adani U.S. bonds,” according to the short seller’s July 1 statement.

Hindenburg also called out India’s markets regulator for failing to address the fraud allegations in its report last year.

Securities and Exchange Board of India, or Sebi, “seems more interested in pursuing those who expose such practices” while its investigation into billionaire Adani’s empire has hit a wall, Hindenburg said.

Its latest broadside comes at a time when India’s newly energized opposition parties have been criticizing Prime Minister Narendra Modi for crony capitalism, after the leader was returned to power with a smaller mandate than expected last month.

The firm also posted on its website the full “show cause” notice it said it received from Sebi in June, which states that Hindenburg’s report on the Adani Group had certain misrepresentations and inaccurate statements that were meant to mislead readers.

Story continues

In the 46-page document, Sebi said Hindenburg “has resorted to extrapolation and conjecture to emphasize some facts and understate others in favor of negative inference against Adani Group Companies.” It also said the short seller cited a broker banned from the securities market, shaking investors’ trust in the regulatory framework.

Adani Group stocks shrugged off the latest missive from Hindenburg. Shares of all 10 Adani-linked firms traded higher on Tuesday, led by the energy and gas units that rallied more than 4% each.

‘Masking Kotak’

Hindenburg said that Sebi’s notice “conspicuously” failed to mention Kotak Mahindra Bank Ltd., which it said created and oversaw the offshore fund structure used by Hindenburg’s investor partner to bet against Adani. The regulator “masked the ‘Kotak’ name with the acronym “KMIL”,” it added, though Kotak is the body with ties to India.

KMIL refers to Kotak Mahindra Investments Ltd., the asset management company. Kotak Mahindra Bank’s shares slipped as much as 3% on Tuesday after Hindenburg’s disclosures.

Kotak said in a statement on Tuesday that Hindenburg has never been a client of Kotak Mahindra International Ltd.

Sebi’s notice also named US hedge fund Kingdon Capital Management as an involved party, stating that Kingdon knew about Hindenburg’s research on the Adani Group before it was published and had a profit-sharing pact with the short-seller on its trades.

Hindenburg shared a draft of the Adani report with Kingdon in November 2022, nearly two months before it published the report, according to the Sebi show cause notice. In return Kingdon agreed to share 30% of its net profits from trading securities related to Adani with Hindenburg. That profit-sharing then got reduced to 25%, due to the cost of setting up these trades.

In January the following year, a fund controlled by Mark Kingdon transferred $43 million to the K India Opportunities Fund, which started building short positions via futures for Adani Enterprises Ltd, the conglomerate’s flagship listed entity, the cause notice said. These short positions were later squared off by Feb. 22 and reaped $22 million.

As of June 1, the Kingdon fund returned $4.1 million of the gains from the Adani short sale to Hindenburg while another $1.4 million has yet to be shared, according to Sebi. In Tuesday’s statement, Kotak said Hindenburg has never been an investor in the K India Opportunities Fund.

The Indian markets regulator didn’t immediately respond to Bloomberg’s request for comment. Nor did the Adani Group. Kingdon Capital Management was not immediately reachable outside of US business hours.

Investing.com,https://www.investing.com/news/company-news/jefferies-raises-tryg-as-shares-target-sees-reduced-earnings-volatility-93CH-3505179,2024-07-02,09:28:16 UTC,"S shares target, sees reduced earnings volatility By Investing.com","On Tuesday, Tryg A/S (TRYG:DC) (OTC: TGVSF) shares saw its price target increased by Jefferies to DKK170.00 from DKK164.00, while the firm maintained a Buy rating on the stock. The adjustment comes as the insurance company nears the release of its second-quarter results for 2024.

The anticipation of the upcoming earnings report has prompted market analysts to consider the potential impact of recent weather events. April's wet conditions followed by a dry May have raised concerns that weather-related losses could exceed budgeted amounts for the company.

Despite these concerns, Tryg's strategic shift away from corporate business is viewed positively. This move is expected to reduce earnings volatility for the insurer. According to Jefferies, this strategy aligns with Tryg's historical performance, potentially leading to the 29th consecutive year-on-year improvement in the quarterly underlying loss ratio of more than 50 basis points.

Tryg's consistent performance in improving its underlying loss ratio is a testament to the company's operational efficiency. The underlying loss ratio, a key indicator of profitability for insurers, measures the percentage of premiums paid out in claims and related expenses.

At 07:20 ET (11:20 GMT), rose 0.8% to $87.27 a barrel, while rose 0.9% to $84.12 a barrel.

Both benchmarks gained around 2% in the previous session, climbing to their highest levels since the end of April.

Independence Day week to see increased travel

Crude’s recent run-up was largely driven by hopes that fuel demand in the U.S. will pick up with the onset of the travel-heavy summer season.

The American Automobile Association forecast that a record number of people will travel by car during the current week, on account of the Independence Day holiday.

“We anticipate this July 4th week will be the busiest ever with an additional 5.7 million people traveling compared to 2019,” the AAA said in a recent statement.

Increased travel during the summer season bodes well for fuel demand, although a recent, sustained increase in U.S. fuel inventories raised questions about just how much of this trend was in play.

Middle East, hurricane supply risks abound

A major point of support for crude in recent sessions was increased concerns over an all-out war in the Middle East, as tensions between Israel and Hezbollah, over Gaza, showed little signs of easing.

Traders attached a higher risk premium to crude over the conflict, betting that supplies from the Middle East will be disrupted by a bigger war. Continued clashes between Russia and Ukraine, with the latter targeting Moscow's oil infrastructure, also factored into crude's risk premium.

Additionally, potential supply disruptions due to Hurricane Beryl in the Caribbean Sea also presented the prospect of tighter crude markets. Beryl was seen making its way towards Mexico and could potentially disrupt offshore oil production along its path.

The prospect of tighter supplies also comes as the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries maintained its current course of production cuts, which analysts expect will substantially tighten crude markets in the remainder of 2024.

API crude stockpile forecast due

Attention will also be on the latest data on U.S. crude stockpiles from the industry body American Petroleum Institute later in the session.

Analysts expect a small drop in crude inventories,suggesting demand is increasing, but last week disappointed with a hefty build.

Will the opposition parties form a sufficiently convincing alliance to prevent the National Rally from gaining an outright majority, or will Marine Le Pen’s National Rally amass the majority despite all efforts?

Both scenarios mean some political uncertainty for France and beyond its borders, but investors’ hearts are pounding toward the first option: a hung government – which would at least prevent Le Pen from exploding the national debt and jeopardize/reverse Macron’s efforts to pull the national debt back to levels acceptable by EU rules.

The latter would help tame the spread between the French and the German bonds – which already retreated below 80pb on Monday on hope and pricing that Le Pen won’t secure a parliamentary majority, and support euro. The rallied to 1.0776 yesterday and flirted with its 50-DMA but retreated to around 1.0730 this morning. The opened the week with a bang, gaining as much as 2.7% before paring losses and closing just 1% up. The European futures are in the negative this morning.

On the data front, European Central Bank (ECB) Chief Lagarde warned that the bank doesn’t have enough evidence that the inflation threat is over, hinting that the ECB will probably bypass a second rate cut when it meets later this month. Inflation numbers revealed by major Eurozone countries since Friday are mixed: as expected in France, a bit higher than expected in Spain, and a bit lower than expected in Italy and Germany. So far, the actual CPI numbers didn’t deviate much from expectations – clearly not enough to deviate the attention from the French election jitters.

The aggregate inflation figure for early June is due today, both headline and core inflation are expected to have eased slightly in June. If that’s the case, we could see the ECB doves breathe a sigh of relief, if not, the euro could see a minor support but in both cases, the euro will remain under the pressure of French political uncertainties throughout the week, and any rally attempts could limited into the second election weekend in France.

In the US, data released yesterday posted softer-than-expected numbers in June and a decline in construction spending in May. Atlanta Fed’s GDP Now plunged to 1.7%. All that softness could’ve pulled the US yields lower but the political news – there - interfere with the market pricing as well.

According to the latest, the Supreme Court said that Donald Trump will benefit from some immunity from criminal charges for trying to reverse the 2020 election, making him a step closer to winning this year’s presidential election after last week’s worrying debate for Joe Biden. The Trump win expectation makes US curve steeping an active bet according to Morgan Stanley analysts who say that Trump in the White House will slow growth and boost inflation – with increased trade tensions and more tariffs.

In the FX, the fell yesterday on a knee-jerk jump in the euro but is upbeat this morning. The continues its hike above the 161.50 level, preparing to test the 162 with limited upside potential given the direct FX intervention threat. The franc is giving back the safe haven gains of late. The is back above the 100-DMA while the takes over the 50-DMA offers. The Swiss National Bank’s (SNB) dovish stance should keep the franc on a softening path, apart from periods of sudden appreciation due to safe-haven flows.

In equities, the consolidated gains near record on Monday, s Tesla (NASDAQ: ) jumped more than 6% to above its 200-DMA ahead of the quarterly deliveries report that’s due today, and that could confirm a second-quarter decline in deliveries. The Chinese rival BYD (SZ: ) on the other hand is down in Hong Kong after announcing to have sold 1 million cars in Q2 – around 426K of them being purely electric.

In energy, started the week strong ahead of the July 4th holiday in the US, which AAA predicts will see a record number of drivers, and Hurricane Beryl, which is not expected to impact operations in the Gulf of Mexico immediately but could cause disruptions later in the week. US crude rallied 2.4% and hit the $84pb mark for the first time since April. Risks remain tilted to the upside, the next target for the bulls stands at $85pb level, where we should see support and rebound given that the soft manufacturing data from the US and China at the start of the week don’t give a further support.

Elsewhere, remains under pressure ahead of Thursday’s general election while the couldn’t really benefit from a softer sterling and a rapid rise in oil prices yesterday and closed the session near flat. The election uncertainty seemingly keeps the bulls on the sidelines even though a Labour win is seen as a net positive for British stocks.

The price pullbacks in the FTSE 100 are likely interesting opportunities to strengthen long positions in energy-heavy British stocks that should fully benefit from reflation trades once the election is behind. Zooming out, the FTSE 100 didn’t do bad at all over the past few quarters. The index posted a fourth-quarter gain in the Q2, has hit a record high in May and remains upbeat as we enter the second half on expectation of more political stability, an upcoming Bank of England (BoE) rate cut and improved reflation flows.","The rallied to 1.0776 yesterday and flirted with its 50-DMA but retreated to around 1.0730 this morning.

However, we must continue to keep track of “what we see rather than what we think” it will happen. That being said I see with a very interesting reversal from the 106 resistance level that we highlighted last week. There is potential for further weakness going into this week, as price can be coming out an ending diagonal pattern. However, it’s unclear how volatile can be this week, maybe some European and US data can impact the FX in next couple of days, but then on Thursday markets can be slow because of US Independence Day, trading conditions that can even expand into Friday. Additionally, US yields are coming a bit higher, so dollar bears may face challenges breaking through the 105 support level.

Euro Gains Despite Strong Result From the National Rally Party

France’s National Rally party confirmed expectations by winning the highest level of support in the first round of the country’s parliamentary elections, ahead of the left-wing New Popular Front coalition and miles ahead of Macron’s centrist alliance. National Rally's leader Marie Le Pen has literally won round one of the fight, but nothing has been decided yet as the countdown to the second round, and final one, of elections has already started.

Le Pen is clearly aiming to achieve a majority by winning 289 seats in the next parliament and make President Macron’s life difficult until 2027, when the next presidential elections are scheduled for. However, the left-wing coalition and Macron’s alliance are now weighing whether to support each other's candidates in Sunday’s second round, which could prove successful and potentially stop Le Pen's party from achieving the crucial majority.

European stock markets have opened in the green today and the has gapped higher again against the as the French opposition parties’ seemingly unified front against Le Pen has been seen as a positive step. However, should this effort fail and Le Pen et al manage to achieve a parliamentary majority, there is scope for significant underperformance of the euro across the board.

German Inflation Next; Focus Also on ECB Forums

Amidst these developments in France, the market will have to digest a rather busy schedule, especially in the euro area. The preliminary inflation report from Germany will be published later today with the eurozone aggregate figures coming on Tuesday. There is a small possibility of an upside surprise today, but these inflation prints are unlikely to change the outcome of the July meeting since the ECB hawks remain very uncomfortable about the June rate cut. As President Lagarde mentioned at the last ECB gathering, the ECB needs to see a plethora of data confirming the disinflation process in order to cut rates again.

Interestingly, the annual ECB forum on Central Banking starts today in Sintra, Portugal with Lagarde holding the introductory speech later today. There will be a barrage of speeches from central bankers over the next three days, including comments from various Fed officials with Chairman Powell participating in a panel discussion tomorrow.

Key US Data Week as Biden’s Future in Tatters

The holiday-shortened week across the pond starts on a high note with the release of the June ISM manufacturing survey with the crucial non-farm payroll report coming on Friday. The key point of discussion though in the US is still the recent presidential debate and more specifically President Biden’s performance. Speculation is rife that he could eventually be forced to step down with vice-president Kamala Harris being the frontrunner to replace him.

Yen Remains Under Pressure

Despite the ongoing dollar weakness and a barrage of comments from Japanese government officials, the pair remains above the 160-yen level. It is evident that the market is testing the BoJ, but the mixed data is not giving the green light to Governor Ueda et al to respond appropriately using monetary policy. Market intervention remains the other option for the BoJ, with arguable results at best.","Le Pen is clearly aiming to achieve a majority by winning 289 seats in the next parliament and make President Macron’s life difficult until 2027, when the next presidential elections are scheduled for.

As the stock market continues to show volatility today, three companies are capturing investors’ attention due to significant news and price movements. Tesla, Chewy Inc, and Walgreens Boots Alliance are all experiencing notable shifts in their stock prices and facing key developments that could impact their future performance.

Tesla Stock Gains Ahead of Q2 Vehicle Deliveries Report

Tesla’s stock is surging today, up 6.51% to $210.76, as investors eagerly await the company’s Q2 global vehicle deliveries report, set to be released on Tuesday, July 2, 2024.



Despite the current rally, Tesla’s year-to-date return remains negative at -15.10%. Analysts are predicting Q2 deliveries of around 436,000 vehicles, representing a 6.5% decrease from Q2 2023 but a 13% increase from Q1 2024. Some analysts are even more conservative, forecasting deliveries in the 410,000-425,000 range.

Beyond vehicle deliveries, investors are also focusing on Tesla’s energy storage business. The company deployed a record 4,053 MWh of energy storage in Q1 2024, with CEO Elon Musk projecting 200-300% year-over-year growth in this segment. Additionally, Tesla plans to unveil its “robotaxi” on August 8, 2024, which is seen as a potential catalyst for future growth.

Chewy Inc Stock Becomes Volatile After GameStop Short Squeeze Trader Announces Massive Stake

Chewy’s stock experienced significant volatility today following news that Keith Gill, known as “Roaring Kitty” from the 2021 GameStop (NYSE: ) meme stock rally, has disclosed a 6.6% stake in the company.



The stock initially surged 15% in premarket trading but has since reversed those gains, currently trading down 6.15% at $25.57. Gill’s stake, worth about $245 million, makes him the third-largest shareholder in Chewy.

Despite today’s downturn, Chewy’s year-to-date return remains positive at 8.19%. The online pet food and medicine retailer, founded by current GameStop CEO Ryan Cohen, has maintained stable sales despite weaker overall consumer spending. However, the company’s P/E ratio of 143.37 and negative 5-year return of -26.96% highlight the challenges it faces in a competitive e-commerce landscape.

Walgreens Boots Alliance Slides After Boots CEO Quits

Walgreens Boots Alliance stock is down 4.18% today to $11.59, continuing a troubling trend for the company. WBA’s year-to-date return stands at -54.48%, with a staggering 5-year return of -73.13%. The company recently missed Q3 earnings expectations and has been under pressure due to a weak outlook.

Adding to investor concerns, Boots CEO Sebastian James announced he would leave the company in November 2024 after six years in the role.



This news comes as WBA has decided against selling or floating Boots for the second time in two years. Despite these challenges, under James’ leadership, Boots’ market share has grown for 13 successive quarters, with recent results showing total UK sales growth of 1.6% and comparable retail sales growth of 6%.

Perhaps that was the ultimate contrarian indicator, as the stock price fell from an intraday high of $140 on June 20th (Thursday) to a closing price of $118 on June 24th (Monday). That’s a loss of $542 billion in market cap over a three-day period.

NVDA is another bubble among the various asset bubble charts throughout history starting with the 1600’s Dutch tulip bulb bubble on the upper left (source: @great_martis):

We’re being told that “it’s different this time” with respect to NVDA’s market cap. One portfolio manager was on CNBC saying he expects NVDA to hit a $6 trillion market cap this year “as investors realize how cheap the stock is” That would be a double from the current stock price. It’s a laughable prediction. That would take the trailing P/E to 144, the forward P/E to 68x and the price/sales to 76x. I just don’t see it happening.

The bulls seem to believe that NVDA will maintain its lead in AI chips and near-monopolistic pricing power in perpetuity. It won’t. At some point competitors will bring competitive chips to market at lower prices. Plus, most are overlooking the fact that semiconductors are a highly cyclical industry. The proliferation of AI will not change that. At some point the market will become saturated with NVDA’s chips and its business will be subjected to the law of supply and demand.

NVDA’s share price has a history of boom/bust cycles. On a split-adjusted basis after the recent 10:1 stock split, NVDA went from 5 cents in October 1999 to as high as 61 cents in January 2002. By September 2002 it had dropped back to 7 cents. Between September 2004 and October 2007, another stock bubble era, NVDA ran from 12 cents to as high as 99 cents. By November 2008 it had dropped to as low as 14 cents. The cliff-dive in “Dutch tulip bulb” charts happens much more quickly than the ascent to the top of the cliff. It won’t be different this time.

After that three-day plunge, NVDA stabilized at its 21 DMA (light blue ma line, $123.21 on Friday). Volume has tailed off considerably and the RSI/MACD momentum indicators are heading south. Those three attributes suggest the stock is losing “energy.” Also, the last three days of the week the stock closed well off of its highs of the day.","Perhaps that was the ultimate contrarian indicator, as the stock price fell from an intraday high of $140 on June 20th (Thursday) to a closing price of $118 on June 24th (Monday).

In no particular order, here are four small-cap biotech stocks that could make for some interesting trading ideas for investors interested in the sector.

Humacyte

This stock is trending on Yahoo! Finance today because the U.S. Food and Drug Administration granted another one of its products a special status. Humacyte Inc (NASDAQ: ) is building bioengineered tissues that can be implanted into patients.

The the company a third Regenerative Medicine Advanced Therapy (RMAT) designation for its Acellular Tissue Engineered Vessel (ATEV), which targets advanced peripheral artery disease (PAD). The designation is aimed at expediting the review process for regenerative therapies that target serious illnesses. The FDA also cleared Humacyte's investigational new drug (IND) application for its ATEV for PAD.

Humacyte spiked around 11% on Monday, and is up some 85% year to date.





Arcutis Biotherapeutics

This commercial-stage biopharmaceutical company is working on treatments for skin diseases like psoriasis, eczema and atopic dermatitis. Currently, Arcutis Biotherapeutics Inc (NASDAQ: ) offers cream to treat plaque psoriasis and a foam to treat seborrheic dermatitis on the market, both with the active ingredient roflumilast sold under the Zoryve brand name.

Arcutis' pipeline contains three products: ARQ-252 to treat inflammatory skin diseases like chronic hand eczema; ARQ-255 for alopecia areata; and ARQ-234, potentially to target atopic dermatitis.

The company's stock has skyrocketed year to date, climbing some 200% as of this writing.

Monday was actually an excellent day for several biotech stocks — not just Humacyte. For Arcutis, investors are anticipating an FDA ruling on its supplemental NDA for its roflumilast cream to treat atopic dermatitis in patients as young as six years old. That ruling is expected on July 7.

Inhibikase Therapeutics

Inhibikase Therapeutics Inc (NASDAQ: ) is developing some promising treatments for Parkinson's disease and other neurodegenerative diseases. The company's lead candidate is risvodetinib for various stages of Parkinson's patients in the early stage of the disease or who have never been treated for the illness.

The drug candidate is also in trials for constipation stemming from nerve disease or injury, difficulty swallowing, and multiple system atrophy (MSA), an illness with some similarities to Parkinson's for which the FDA has not yet approved a single treatment.

IKT stock is down around 12% year to date, so there may be some gas left in the tank with this one in the near term.

Bicycle Therapeutics

Bicycle Therapeutics Ltd (NASDAQ: ) is developing treatments for underserved patient populations via a totally new approach to targeting disease. The company describes the new kind of novel molecule it has developed as ""bicycles,"" which differ from conventional small molecules in that they can easily be conjugated to other chemical payloads without losing their desired pharmacology.

Notably, Bicycle has some strong collaborations in place, including with Novartis (SIX: ) and Bayer (OTC: ) Consumer Care. The company's pipeline currently includes: BT8009, in Phase 2/3 trials; BT5528, in Phase 2/ Expansion trials; and BT1718, also in Phase 2/ Expansion trials. All candidates target various kinds of cancer.

Bicycle stock is up 11% year to date, so for investors interested in this company's novel approach, there may still be some near-term upside.

Small-cap biotech ETFs

Investors who don't want to pick individual small-cap biotech stocks might consider an exchange-traded fund, although ETFs sometimes miss out on the most promising companies in the very earliest stages. In fact, it's extremely challenging to zero in on small-cap biotech because most ETFs focused on the sector target larger names.

Nonetheless, you can uncover some particularly interesting biotech ETFs by zeroing in on an area of particular interest. For example, the Range Oncology Therapeutics Index ETF (NASDAQ: ) may be of interest to investors who want to support cancer treatment with their investment dollars.

This ETF is nearly flat year to date, up by about 1%.

Some other interesting ETFs include:

ALPS Medical Breakthroughs ETF (NYSE: ) – up 2% YTD

Global X Genomics & Biotechnology ETF (NASDAQ: ) – off 10% YTD

AdvisorShares Psychedelics ETF (NYSE: ) – down 30% YTD

WisdomTree BioRevolution Fund (NYSE: ) – off 6% YTD

For a broader view on the biotech sector, some options include the iShares Biotechnology ETF (NASDAQ: ), the SPDR® S&P Biotech ETF (NYSE: ), and the VanEck Biotech ETF (NASDAQ: ).

Of course, investors are always advised to do their own due diligence before investing in any stock or theme.","In no particular order, here are four small-cap biotech stocks that could make for some interesting trading ideas for investors interested in the sector.

Investing.com,https://www.investing.com/analysis/2-major-reversal-patterns-sp-500-bulls-will-look-to-avoid-this-week-200649626,2024-07-01,06:58:00 UTC,2 Major Reversal Patterns S&P 500 Bulls Will Look to Avoid This Week,"Stocks finished last week mostly flat to lower, with the down by around 40 bps on Friday, while the finished lower by around 50 bps. This came following a Friday morning rally met by selling that started a bit after 10 a.m.

The selling was enough to push the S&P 500 more than 1% off its morning highs and create a bearish engulfing candle on the daily chart. It was the second such candle in a week.

This has created 2 key reversal patterns that the bulls will look to avoid this week:

1. 2B Daily Top Reversal Pattern

It also created what appears to be a 2b top reversal pattern. These patterns don’t always work, but they are nice to use because they give us levels to work with that tell us a lot about where the market may be heading.

This pattern often forms when an index or stock attempts to make a new, fails to hold that high, and then closes below the previous closing high.

2. Weekly Close Pattern

Even on the weekly candle, we saw this week’s high surpass last week’s high, with the index closing lower on the week. This doesn’t happen often, but it has happened several times since January 2020.

Over that time, it appears to have occurred eight other times, and 7 of those times, it has led to a lower week the following week. In 5 of the seven occasions, it led to declines of 35.3%, 11.2%, 14.4%, 12.9%, and 19.3%.

On the other two occasions, the index fell by 2.1%; on the other, it fell by 2.5%. There was only one time the index moved higher: in January 2021. So, the signal carries some weight with it and should not be ignored or easily dismissed.

This tells us a couple of things that we can use to help us better assess what comes next. If the S&P 500 closes above 5,487.02 on the daily chart this week, the daily 2b top trading pattern will be invalidated.

The weekly reversal candle will be invalidated if the S&P 500 closes above 5464.61 on the weekly chart.

People will look at this and say it is ridiculous to think that the S&P 500 could drop by some of the abovementioned values. I could also argue that it would have been foolish to believe that the S&P 500 could rally as much as it has since the October 2023 low.

It took the S&P 500 271 days to rally approximately 18% from 4,100 on April 8, 2021, to the intraday high of 4,818 on January 4, 2022, when overnight rates were 0%, and the Fed was conducting QE. It has taken the S&P 500 245 days to rally 34.4% from its low on October 27 of 4,100 to its intraday high the week of June 28, with overnight rates of 5.33% and the Fed draining the balance sheet.

Which one sounds more ridiculous now? So caution is warranted currently, and being cautious is not the same as being short or perma bearish. It is about assessing the odds and managing one’s risk.

Some conditions in this market are at extremes, especially regarding implied correlations, which closed below 6, the lowest level ever, not by a little but by more than a whole point at 5.59 versus the previous low of 6.78 in October 2017.

Meanwhile, high-yield credit spreads are trending higher as stock prices rise. We last saw these conditions develop in January 2020 and the fall of 2021.

In the meantime, the appears to be in the process of completing a giant ascending broadening wedge, as the 20-day moving average is serving as support for the ETF. A break of support at $255 would confirm that the pattern has broken and that a move lower has begun.

Meanwhile, Nvidia (NASDAQ: ) is wedged between the 10-day exponential and the 20-day simple moving averages, which means that things are quite easy because a close above the 10-day EMA could signal a move higher, followed by confirmation, which could lead to pushback to $130. A close below the 20-day moving average, followed by confirmation, could open the floodgates.

That’s all from me. You may not hear from me again until July 10.

Have a happy Fourth of July!

The major indexes are reaching new highs and portraying an image of economic health and investor confidence. However, beneath this seemingly strong facade lies a troubling sign for market participants: a significant deterioration in market breadth.

Market breadth is a crucial measure that indicates the overall market's health. It reflects the number of stocks participating in the uptrend. Currently, while major indexes like the and are climbing, most individual stocks within these indexes are underperforming. This divergence suggests that the gains are being driven by a few large-cap stocks, masking the struggles of the majority.

This trend of narrowing market breadth has persisted throughout the year. Such a scenario can sustain an upward trajectory for the indexes in the short term, driven by the performance of a select few. However, it also increases the likelihood of a market pullback, especially as these indexes become overextended.

With the current market advance showing signs of reaching an overbought state, it’s a critical time for investors to exercise caution. The disparity between index performance and individual stock performance serves as a warning that the market's strength may be more fragile than it appears on the surface.

Visualizing the Divergence: A Tale of Two Indexes

In the chart below, we have a clear visual representation of the growing disparity in market performance. The top panel illustrates the capitalization-weighted S&P 500, which, as noted in the introduction, has continued its ascent, reaching new highs and showcasing the robust performance of the largest stocks within the index. The lower panel, however, tells a different story. This panel displays the , where each stock contributes equally to the index, offering a more balanced view of the broader market's health.

From the start of the year until the end of March, both indexes moved in harmony, reflecting a broad-based rally where gains were relatively evenly distributed among the stocks. However, the divergence that began in April is striking. While the capitalization-weighted S&P 500 maintained its upward momentum, driven by a handful of dominant large-cap stocks, the Equal Weighted S&P 500 began to falter, trending downward. This negative divergence highlights that the majority of stocks within the index have not shared in the recent gains, revealing a troubling decline in market breadth.

The significance of this divergence cannot be overstated. It underscores the cautionary message from the introduction: despite the impressive performance of the headline index, underlying market strength is weakening. The few stocks leading the charge higher can mask the broader market's struggles, but this imbalance often precedes corrections or pullbacks, especially when the market becomes overly extended. Investors should be wary of this trend, as it suggests that the apparent resilience of the market may be more fragile and susceptible to reversal than it appears on the surface.

Divergence Deepens: A Closer Look at Market Breadth

The next chart provides a deeper dive into the evolving landscape of market breadth and further underscores the cautionary signals we've been discussing. The top panel depicts the S&P 500, which has been on an impressive upward trajectory since emerging from a short-term pullback at the end of October 2023. This rally has carried the index to new heights through June 2024, reflecting an ostensibly strong and resilient market.

However, the middle and bottom panels reveal a starkly different narrative. The middle panel tracks the percentage of stocks within the S&P 500 that are above their respective 200-day moving averages, a long-term trend indicator. Since April 2024, this percentage has been in a consistent decline, suggesting that fewer stocks are maintaining their long-term uptrends despite the index's continued advance.

The bottom panel paints an even more concerning picture, showing the percentage of stocks above their 50-day moving averages, a short-term trend indicator. This percentage has been falling since January 2024, indicating that a majority of stocks are failing to sustain even their short-term momentum. The divergence between the S&P 500's performance and the weakening trend participation of its components is clear and concerning.

Notably, the chart highlights the month of June 2024 with a vertical blue line, drawing attention to the continued advance of the S&P 500 during this period. Despite this upward movement, both the middle and bottom panels indicate that the percentage of stocks above their moving averages remained flat, failing to confirm the index's gains. This sideways movement in June suggests a further erosion of market breadth, highlighting that the index's rally is increasingly being driven by a shrinking number of outperforming stocks.

Conclusion

In summary, despite the impressive advance of major indexes like the S&P 500, underlying market strength is weakening. The declining participation of stocks in this rally highlights a troubling divergence and signals a fragile foundation. Investors should approach the market with caution, mindful that the impressive gains of a few cannot indefinitely mask the broader market’s fragility and the increased risk of a significant pullback.

Current Portfolio Allocation: Emphasizing Defense

Given the current market environment, we have positioned all client accounts with a distinctly defensive posture. Our strategy includes an oversized allocation to cash and high-yielding money market funds, ensuring liquidity and stability amid market uncertainties. Additionally, our equity exposure is kept deliberately low, complemented by strategic short positions to serve as hedges against potential market downturns.

One of the key reasons behind our conservative stance on stocks is the prevailing market dynamics that tend to undermine stock performance in environments like this. As discussed earlier, market breadth has been deteriorating, meaning that an increasing number of stocks are struggling or declining.

In such scenarios, the chances of successfully navigating the stock market diminish significantly. Historically, investing in stocks during periods of narrowing breadth often results in subpar returns, as overall market strength is primarily driven by a select few outperformers, while the majority lag or falter.

By maintaining a cautious allocation and focusing on defensive assets, we aim to protect capital and reduce the potential for losses, positioning our clients to weather any volatility that may arise from the current market fragility.","The disparity between index performance and individual stock performance serves as a warning that the market's strength may be more fragile than it appears on the surface.

Investing.com,https://www.investing.com/analysis/sp-500-a-look-at-sector-eps-revenue-growth-trends-heading-into-q2-24-200649633,2024-07-01,06:15:00 UTC,"S&P 500: A Look at Sector EPS, Revenue Growth Trends Heading Into Q2 ’24","Q2 ’24 SP earnings will start in the next two weeks – the big banks should start reporting by Friday, July 12th, ’24.

The above table reflects the historical trends in EPS and revenue growth, starting with Q1 ’23, and for the last two quarters shows how the estimates changed during the Q4 ’23 reporting period and then again for Q1 ’24’s reporting period.

Data source: LSEG (formerly IBES data by Refinitiv)

Here’s what jumped out in looking at this table:

1.) The technology sector still faces a very weak comp in Q2 ’24, versus the Q2 ’23 numbers: tech sector EPS grew only 5% on flat revenue in Q2 ’23. Today, the tech sector EPS is expected to grow 16.9% in Q2 ’24, on revenue growth of 6.7% y-o-y.

More importantly, readers should look at the technology EPS line in Q1 ’23 and then read across (right to left) and note where tech sector EPS growth estimates started in Q4 ’23 and Q1 ’24 and then ended 12 weeks later. Tech sector revenue was pretty much unchanged (no real trend in revenue growth) the last two quarters.

2.) Energy sector: energy sector growth has been negative the last 4 quarters but is expected it improve sharply in Q2 ’24. Same with energy revenue growth, but revenue has been negative the last 5 quarters, i.e. Q1 ’23 through Q1 ’24, but is expected to be +6.4% in Q2 ’24.

3.) Communication services: look at the trend improvement in EPS in Q1 ’24 for Comm Services (i.e. META (NASDAQ: ) and Google (NASDAQ: ) is the lion’s share of the sector). META is now facing tough comps since the stock bottomed in Q3 ’23, and margin grew sharply from there. The easy money may have been made for META, to this point, which is not to say the stock goes down, but META’s operating margin did grow sharply in ’23 and Q1 ’24.

4.) The capital tests for the bank led to a number of buybacks and dividend increases for the big banks on Friday night, June 28, ’24. Let’s see if the financial sector EPS gets a bump into the month of July ’24, as I’m expecting it to do. Capital markets activity, like bond issuance, should still be fairly healthy, although the IPO market seems quiet.

5.) Finally the healthcare sector is expecting it’s best EPS growth since Q1 ’22 in Q2 ’24 at +20.2%. It’s had a horrid string of negative y-o-y growth EPS quarters since Q4 ’22. Healthcare revenue growth is rock solid. Hasn’t wavered much at all although it was mid-teens growth in ’21 and ’22, that has tapered down to mid-single-digits in ’23 and now ’24 no doubt as the Covid vaccines have faded. GLP-1 drugs have really helped growth – even Pfizer (NYSE: ) says they are experimenting with one, although they are well behind the curve.

If readers own just the 5 sectors mentioned that is 70% of the S&P 500’s market cap as of this weekend. No mention was made of consumer discretionary since EPS slowed down from 40% – 50%+ growth in ’23 to 20% – 30% in Q4 ’23 and Q1 ’24, while revenue growth slowed from high-single-digits to mid-single-digits from ’23 into ’24. Tesla’s slowdown in revenue and EPS growth has had to hurt the sector, although Amazon (NASDAQ: ) remains pretty stable. (Amazon and Tesla (NASDAQ: ) were the two biggest sector weights in early ’23.)

Conclusion:

These historical sectors EPS and revenue growth (estimate vs actual) go all the way back to 2010 and 2011, but that data really isn’t relevant today. I started logging the values just to see what was “high, average and low” growth rates, but Covid really skewed the data, resulting in exceptionally high and low figures.

Q2 ’21 saw 96% EPS growth for the S&P 500 on 25% revenue growth. Obviously, that’s not anything near normal.

Q2 ’22 S&P 500 EPS growth is expected at +10.6%, the best quarter of EPS growth since Q1 ’22, while expected revenue growth at +4.2% is the strongest quarter expected since Q1 ’23’s +5.6% actual growth.

Disclosure: Anyway, none of this is advice or a recommendation, but rather an opinion. The goal through the summer will be to see how revenue and EPS growth by sector track versus the starting estimates on June 30 ’24. Past performance is no guarantee of future results. Investing can involve the loss of principal, even for short periods of time. All EPS and revenue data is sourced from the London Stock Exchange Group (www.LON: .com).

Net revenue growth for and Nifty500 companies was 10.2% and 9.9% year-over-year (YoY) respectively, fueled by strong credit demand and robust auto sales. These sectors contributed 76% and 73% to the overall revenue growth of Nifty50 and Nifty500 companies.

For the entire fiscal year, however, the growth was more subdued, with net revenue increasing by 9.3% for Nifty50 and 7.9% for Nifty500 companies, a significant drop from the previous year's growth rates of 23% and 29.6%. Despite this, operating profit growth outpaced revenue growth, with Nifty50 and Nifty500 companies seeing increases of 10.7% and 12.2% YoY respectively. This was achieved despite higher salaries and other operating expenses, leading to substantial margin improvements.

Adjusted net profit (PAT) growth was particularly strong in Q4FY24, with Nifty50 companies experiencing a 21.5% rise and Nifty500 companies seeing a 17.9% increase. Over the full fiscal year, PAT growth for Nifty50 was 27%, while Nifty500 saw a 33% increase. Notably, Financials and Consumer Discretionary sectors were major contributors, accounting for 90% of the earnings growth in both indices. Excluding these sectors, PAT growth was modest at 3.4% for Nifty50 and 2.9% for Nifty500 in Q4FY24.

Export-oriented sectors such as Information Technology and commodity companies in Materials and Energy faced challenges due to weak external demand. Consumer Staples also struggled with lagging rural demand. In contrast, domestic cyclical sectors like Financials, Industrials, and Consumer Discretionary drove overall earnings, supported by resilient urban consumption, government capital expenditure, and improving private investment.

Looking forward, consensus earnings estimates for the top 200 companies by market capitalization show modest increases of 0.1% for FY25 and 2.3% for FY26 since March 2024. This implies expected profit growth of 10.9% in FY25 and 16.7% in FY26, following a robust 34.5% growth in FY24. Financials and Materials are projected to contribute nearly 52% of the incremental earnings for these companies over the next two years, despite comprising only 38.4% of overall corporate earnings in FY24.

The earnings growth outlook for FY25 is supported by resilient urban demand, a recovery in rural demand amid expectations of a normal monsoon, an improvement in external demand with the easing cycle, and sustained government capital expenditure. However, rising input costs could partially offset these positive factors.

Overall, the Q4FY24 earnings review underscores the critical role of Financials and Consumer Discretionary sectors in driving corporate profitability, while highlighting the challenges and potential headwinds facing other sectors. As companies navigate these dynamics, continued strong performance in key sectors will be crucial for sustaining overall growth.

TOKYO (Reuters) - The Bank of Japan (BOJ) could hike interest rates twice by the end of March 2025 to reach 0.5%, reflecting the real growth rate of the Japanese economy, the head of Mizuho Financial Group's banking arm said.

But rapid rate hikes won't be a tool to arrest the weakening yen, which has plunged to a 38-year low against the dollar, Masahiko Kato, chief executive officer of Mizuho Bank, said in an interview with Reuters.

""If (the BOJ) raises rates too strongly, the economic growth that has finally set in will deteriorate,"" Kato said. ""I don't have the impression they'll raise interest rates too hastily.""

The central bank ended negative interest rates after eight years in March, and economists are split over whether another rate increase will come at the next monetary policy later this month.

While inflation translates to higher costs for companies who have to hike wages, this in turn spurs them to adopt new growth strategies such as mergers and acquisitions (M&A), carve-outs, and expansion abroad to boost earnings, Kato said.

Mizuho Bank has identified mid-cap listed companies as a new customer base for its financing and advisory services, as Japan's acute labour shortage means many such firms lack the specialist knowhow to pursue growth, for instance, through M&A.

The fact that so many companies struggle to raise their corporate value after listing lies behind activist investors' growing involvement in Japanese firms, as well as the Tokyo Stock Exchange's campaign to boost corporate value, Kato said.

Mizuho established a seven-person mid-cap growth support team last year, which in April became a standalone department of 70 people.

""Until now it was permissible for companies to have little concept of raising their corporate value,"" Kato said.

""But with the Tokyo Stock Exchange's reforms and now the economy has started moving again, all of a sudden the conditions are in place.""","By Anton Bridge and Miho UranakaTOKYO (Reuters) - The Bank of Japan (BOJ) could hike interest rates twice by the end of March 2025 to reach 0.5%, reflecting the real growth rate of the Japanese economy, the head of Mizuho Financial Group's banking arm said.

Investing.com,https://www.investing.com/news/economy/futures-lower-feds-powell-to-speak-boeing-plea-deal--whats-moving-markets-3504833,2024-07-02,05:27:24 UTC,"Futures lower, Fed's Powell to speak, Boeing plea deal","Investing.com -- U.S. stock futures edge down as investors prepare for incoming labor market data during a holiday-shortened trading week. Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell is due to speak at an European Central Bank event, with the Fed's potential interest rate path for the rest of the year in focus. Elsewhere, U.S. federal prosecutors are reportedly awaiting a decision from Boeing (NYSE: ) on a plea deal to settle charges linked to two fatal crashes.

1. Futures lower

U.S. stock futures pointed lower on Tuesday after the main averages on Wall Street rose in light pre-holiday trading in the prior session.

By 03:19 ET (07:19 GMT), the contract had shed 96 points or 0.3%, had dipped by 17 points or 0.3%, and had fallen by 83 points or 0.4%.

All three of the indices finished higher on Monday, with the tech-heavy boosted in particular by a jump in Big Tech names like electric carmaker Tesla (NASDAQ: ) and iPhone giant Apple (NASDAQ: ). Trading volumes were relatively muted as equity markets prepared to shutter for the U.S. Independence Day holiday on Thursday.

Meanwhile, investors remained focused on the release of key U.S. labor market data this week, including job openings figures on Tuesday and the monthly non-farm payrolls report on Friday. The numbers could factor into how the Federal Reserve approaches potential interest rate cuts later this year.

2. Powell to speak at Sintra

Fed Chair Jerome Powell is set to participate in a panel at a European Central Bank conference in Sintra on Tuesday, with markets keen to see if he will provide any new cues on interest rates.

Powell's comments will serve as a precursor to the publication of minutes from the Fed's June policy gathering on Wednesday, when the central bank's rate-setting Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) signaled that it only expects to reduce borrowing costs once this year -- down from three in March.

Yet traders, buoyed by hopes for a continued cooling in U.S. inflation, are still betting the Fed will roll out roughly two cuts in 2024 beginning in September, according CME Group's (NASDAQ: ) closely-monitored FedWatch Tool.

""There has been a tendency from Powell to be a bit more optimistic than the FOMC consensus on disinflation, and we think there are some downside risks for the dollar ahead of today’s speech,"" analysts at ING said in a note.

3. Federal prosecutors awaiting Boeing decision on plea deal - AP

The U.S. Justice Department is waiting for Boeing to accept a plea deal to settle felony fraud charges related to two fatal crashes of its 737 Max planes, according to the Associated Press.

Citing people familiar with the matter, the AP said Boeing has until the end of the week to either accept or reject the offer, which would also see the company agree to independent monitoring for compliance with anti-fraud laws.

The proposal stems from a Justice Department finding earlier this year that Boeing had misled regulators who had approved the 737 Max, violating the terms of a 2021 agreement shielding the firm from prosecution over deadly crashes in 2018 and 2019 that killed 346 people.

While accepting the deal would save Boeing from a potentially bruising courtroom battle, it threatens to cloud over its ongoing attempt to move beyond a dangerous mid-air panel blowout in January on one of its jets operated by Alaska Airlines.

4. Billionaire Barry Diller eyeing possible Paramount bid - NYT

Billionaire Barry Diller is considering a bid to take over Paramount Global (NASDAQ: ) after the studio he formerly led pulled out of a merger with Skydance Media, the New York Times reported on Monday.

Diller’s media conglomerate IAC signed nondisclosure agreements with National Amusements, Paramount’s controlling shareholder, the NYT report said, citing people close to the matter. A nondisclosure agreement usually precedes negotiations over a deal.

The NDAs were also signed sometime after deal talks between Paramount and Skydance fell through earlier in the year, the NYT report said.

Diller had bid for Paramount in the early 1990's, but was outbid by Sumner Redstone, whose daughter Shari now controls the studio. Diller had also led the studio in the 1970's and 80's, and was credited with reviving it through several popular projects.

Paramount is the parent company of several major networks, including CBS, MTV and Nickelodeon. The firm has engaged in sale talks with several potential suitors over the past year, but none have so far borne fruit.

5. Crude hovering near two-month highs

Crude prices inched up on Tuesday, holding near two-month highs on expectations for rising fuel demand during the U.S. summer.

By 03:20 ET, the futures (WTI) had gained 0.1% to $83.42 a barrel, while the contract had climbed 0.1% to $86.71 per barrel. Both benchmarks touched to their highest levels since the end of April during the previous session.

Gasoline demand in the U.S., the world's biggest oil consumer, is expected to ramp up as the summer travel season gathers steam due to the Independence Day holiday.

Traders will also be looking at the latest data on U.S. crude stockpiles from the industry body American Petroleum Institute later in the session, as well as possible disruptions from Hurricane Beryl on U.S. oil refining and offshore production in the Gulf of Mexico.","Investing.com -- U.S. stock futures edge down as investors prepare for incoming labor market data during a holiday-shortened trading week.

The Swedish-based company, controlled by China's Geely, currently makes all its EVs in China.

Its new model, the Polestar 3, will be made in the United States from the end of this summer and the Polestar 4 will be produced in South Korea starting in the second half of 2025.

Polestar has been working for some time to reduce its reliance on Chinese production.

Steps it plans to announce later this year could include material cost reductions across Polestar's supply chain or other actions, a spokesperson said, but added the plans do not include further job cuts.

In the meantime, Polestar faces provisional tariffs of 20% proposed by the European Commission on cars it imports into the European Union and duties of more than 100% in the United States.

Polestar told Reuters there would be no customer delays due to tariffs and that it was not possible to produce the Polestar 4 in any other location.

Like others it faces a worsening demand outlook for EV makers, where a price war started last year by rival Tesla (NASDAQ: ) has left many automakers struggling to sell cars they have already produced.

The company has a cash flow break-even target for 2025 which it risks not meeting due to the tariffs and price war.

On Tuesday it posted a first-quarter operating loss of $231.7 million while revenue plunged to $345.3 million from $543.4 million a year earlier.

The company received a non-binding offer of $4.80 per share from its majority shareholder and affiliates, which aligns with Raymond James' previous price target of $5. However, the stock currently trades above the offer price.

While Raymond James doesn't rule out a higher bid, they express skepticism due to potential ""hidden costs"" for the buyer related to upgrades for WideOpenWest's legacy infrastructure. These costs could suppress the acquisition multiple.

(Reuters) -Hindenburg Research refuted allegations on Monday from India's securities regulator accusing the company of colluding with a U.S. asset manager to use non-public information to set up its short bet against Adani Group last year.

In a statement posted to its website, U.S.-based short-seller Hindenburg provided a copy of a 46-page show cause notice from the Securities and Exchange Board of India (SEBI) outlining the allegations that six entities including Hindenburg, asset manager Kingdon Capital Management and a Mauritus-based trading fund set up by Kotak Mahindra Bank violated certain rules under the Prevention of Fraud and Unfair Trade Practices regulation.

While SEBI has not made the notice public, two sources at the regulator with direct knowledge of the matter confirmed its authenticity.

The allegations, if proven, could result in monetary penalties and the payback of any illegal gains.

Hindenburg responded saying the notice is ""nonsense"" and an attempt to silence and intimidate by alleging that Hindenburg's report contained misrepresentations and inaccurate statements meant to mislead readers.

""In our view, SEBI has neglected its responsibility, seemingly doing more to protect those perpetrating fraud than to protect the investors being victimized by it,"" Hindenburg said.

The disclosure of the SEBI notice adds a new twist in the saga that began last year when Hindenburg, founded by Nathan Anderson, alleged improper business dealings by Adani.

Adani, which refuted the allegations, suffered a loss of as much as $150 billion in combined market value after the report, but has since rebounded.

In the notice, SEBI alleges Hindenburg colluded with its client Kingdon Capital Management by providing a draft of its report on Adani Group before it was released publicly.

SEBI alleges that Mark Kingdon, the owner of Kingdon Capital, then set up a fund able to trade Indian equities known as K Indian Opportunities Fund. That fund created short positions in Adani group stocks between Jan. 10, 2023, and Jan. 20, 2023, five days ahead of the Hindenburg report being published, according to the SEBI documents.

In its statement, Hindenburg said a Mauritius registered unit of Kotak Mahindra Bank, an Indian firm, created and oversaw an offshore fund structure that was used by its ""investor partner"" to bet against Adani's shares.

The positions were squared off in February, leading to gains of $22.25 million, the SEBI documents said.

Hindenburg in its statement does not comment on its relationship with Kingdon.

An email to Hindenburg Research and Kingdon Capital was not immediately answered.

SEBI has not replied to a request for comment on Hindenburg's statement and to confirm the authenticity of the show cause order.

Kotak did not reply to a request for comment.

Hindenburg's response sheds some light on the mechanics of its Adani short trade, the details of which intrigued other investors because Indian securities rules make it hard for foreigners to bet against companies there.

Hindenburg said it made $4.1 million in gross revenue through ""gains related to Adani shorts from that investor relationship"" and just $31,000 through its short position of Adani's U.S. bonds. It did not name the investor.

""It was a tiny position,"" it said. ""But, to date, our research on Adani is by far the work we are most proud of.""","The disclosure of the SEBI notice adds a new twist in the saga that began last year when Hindenburg, founded by Nathan Anderson, alleged improper business dealings by Adani.

(NASDAQ: ) to Neutral from Overweight in a note Tuesday, citing valuation concerns despite continued optimism on the company's future.

""Shares have deservedly risen to the highest revenue multiple of any public software company above $75B in market cap,"" the analysts note, adding they ""do not see a near-term catalyst for raising"" their $400 price target.

This downgrade is a ""valuation call,"" according to Piper Sandler. They acknowledge CrowdStrike's strong performance and momentum but believe the current stock price has already priced in much of this future growth.

The firm adds that by reaching an annual recurring revenue (ARR) of $3.6 billion and a fiscal 2025 revenue forecast exceeding $4 billion, CrowdStrike's large scale makes significant upside more challenging as growth rates face the ""law of large numbers."" This could lead to returns lagging behind other cybersecurity companies.

Further, Piper Sandler highlights CrowdStrike's premium valuation. Compared to similar software companies, CrowdStrike boasts the highest valuations in terms of both forward-year sales (18.9x) and free cash flow (57x).

Despite the downgrade, Piper Sandler remains ""excited about the second act for CRWD,"" citing its cloud, identity, logging, and IT offerings. They acknowledge CrowdStrike's impressive execution and strong metrics but believe the current price reflects this optimism.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. manufacturing contracted for a third straight month in June as demand remained subdued, while a drop in a measure of prices paid by factories for inputs to a six-month low suggested that inflation could continue to subside.

The weakness at the end of the second quarter reported by the Institute for Supply Management on Monday was across the board, with ISM Manufacturing Business Survey Committee Chair Timothy Fiore describing manufacturers as demonstrating ""an unwillingness to invest in capital and inventory due to current monetary policy and other conditions.""

Manufacturing is being pressured by higher interest rates and softening demand for goods, though business investment has largely held up.

""We expect the manufacturing sector to remain weak over the next couple of quarters,"" said Oliver Allen, senior U.S. economist at Pantheon Macroeconomics. ""The retreat in corporate bond yields since late last year ... seems to have provided some support to investment spending, but not enough to get manufacturing growing again. A much more significant loosening in financial conditions is required to change that.""

The ISM's manufacturing PMI slipped to 48.5 last month from 48.7 in May. A PMI reading above 50 indicates growth in the manufacturing sector, which accounts for 10.3% of the economy. The PMI remains above the 42.5 level, which the ISM says over a period of time indicates an expansion of the overall economy.

Economists polled by Reuters had forecast the PMI climbing to 49.1. It has indicated contraction in manufacturing in 19 of the last 20 months. Sixty-two percent of manufacturing gross domestic product contracted, up from 55% in May.

The share of sector GDP registering a composite PMI at or below 45 — a good barometer of overall manufacturing weakness — jumped to 14% from 4% in the prior month.

Eight manufacturing industries, including primary metals and chemical products, reported growth. Machinery, transportation equipment, electrical equipment, appliances and components as well as computer and electronic products were among the nine industries that contracted.

Commentary from manufacturers was mostly downbeat. Makers of chemical products reported a ""high volume of customer orders."" Transportation equipment manufacturers, however, complained that ""customers continue to cut orders with short notice, causing a ripple effect throughout lower-tier suppliers.""

Makers of electrical equipment, appliances and components reported that ""customers (were) ordering more to create buffer stocks, in case of future shortages. Manufacturers of fabricated metal products mentioned signs of weak demand, adding ""we must work to reduce inventory levels.""

Machinery manufacturers said ""sales backlog is decreasing,"" and that they had ""furloughed a portion of our workforce as a result."" Makers of miscellaneous manufactured goods reported that the ""level of production is lower due to decreased demand for products.""

Government data last week showed manufacturing contracted at a 4.3% annualized rate in the first quarter, with most of the decline coming from long-lasting manufactured goods.

The Federal Reserve has maintained its benchmark overnight interest rate in the current 5.25%-5.50% range since last July. Financial markets expect the U.S. central bank to start its easing cycle in September, though policymakers recently adopted a more hawkish outlook. The Fed has hiked its policy rate by 525 basis points since 2022 to quell inflation.

The ISM survey's forward-looking new orders sub-index rose to a still-subdued 49.3 reading from 45.4 in May. Output at factories decreased for the first time since February. The production sub-index fell to 48.5 from 50.2 in May.

Inflation at the factory gate was much cooler. The survey's measure of prices paid by manufacturers dropped to 52.1, the lowest reading since December, from 57.0 in May.

Declining goods prices accounted for much of the unchanged reading in monthly inflation in May, and the decrease in input prices last month bodes well for the continued disinflationary trend in the broader economy.

That was reinforced by the fourth straight month of faster delivery performance of suppliers to manufacturers.

""The improvement in supply chains ought to be viewed favorably by the Fed in terms of rebalancing demand for and supply of goods,"" said Conrad DeQuadros, senior economic advisor at Brean Capital.

Factory employment slipped after briefly rebounding in May amid layoffs, attrition and hiring freezes.

The overall labor market is gradually cooling. The government is likely to report on Friday that nonfarm payrolls increased by 190,000 jobs in June after surging 272,000 in May, according to a Reuters survey of economists. The unemployment rate is forecast unchanged at 4.0%.

Higher borrowing costs are also chipping away at growth in the construction sector, which had been boosted by demand for new homes amid a shortage of previously owned houses for sale.

A separate report from the Commerce Department's Census Bureau on Monday showed construction spending dipped 0.1% in May after an upwardly revised 0.3% increase in April. Economists had forecast construction spending rebounding 0.2% after a previously reported 0.1% fall in April.

Investment in residential construction dropped 0.2% after surging 0.9% in April. While mortgage rates have retreated from May's lofty levels, housing supply has improved considerably as demand slackened, which could limit growth in new construction.

""The perpetuation of high-for-long interest rate policy boosted the benchmark 30-year fixed mortgage rate back above 7% this spring, and demand for housing appears to have softened in response across a range of measures,"" said Michael Hanson, an economist at JPMorgan. ""We see a likely pullback in residential construction during the second half of this year.""","Manufacturing is being pressured by higher interest rates and softening demand for goods, though business investment has largely held up.
""We expect the manufacturing sector to remain weak over the next couple of quarters,"" said Oliver Allen, senior U.S. economist at Pantheon Macroeconomics.
The ISM's manufacturing PMI slipped to 48.5 last month from 48.7 in May.
A PMI reading above 50 indicates growth in the manufacturing sector, which accounts for 10.3% of the economy.
The survey's measure of prices paid by manufacturers dropped to 52.1, the lowest reading since December, from 57.0 in May.","['inflation', 'manufacturing', 'prices', 'manufacturers', 'rate', 'pressures', 'demand', 'construction', 'pmi', 'supply', 'sector', 'ebbing', 'extends', 'slump', 'reported']",https://i-invdn-com.investing.com/news/Brazil-Stock-Market_3_800x533_L_1414427437.jpg,False,lucia mutikani washington reuter us manufactur contract third straight month june demand remain subdu drop measur price paid factori input sixmonth low suggest inflat could continu subsid weak end second quarter report institut suppli manag monday across board ism manufactur busi survey committe chair timothi fior describ manufactur demonstr an unwilling invest capit inventori due current monetari polici condit manufactur pressur higher interest rate soften demand good though busi invest larg held up we expect manufactur sector remain weak next coupl quarter said oliv allen senior us economist pantheon macroeconom the retreat corpor bond yield sinc late last year seem provid support invest spend enough get manufactur grow again much signific loosen financi condit requir chang that ism manufactur pmi slip last month may pmi read indic growth manufactur sector account economi pmi remain level ism say period time indic expans overal economi economist poll reuter forecast pmi climb indic contract manufactur last month sixtytwo percent manufactur gross domest product contract may share sector gdp regist composit pmi -- good baromet overal manufactur weak -- jump prior month eight manufactur industri includ primari metal chemic product report growth machineri transport equip electr equip applianc compon well comput electron product among nine industri contract commentari manufactur most downbeat maker chemic product report high volum custom order transport equip manufactur howev complain custom continu cut order short notic caus rippl effect throughout lowerti supplier maker electr equip applianc compon report custom were order creat buffer stock case futur shortag manufactur fabric metal product mention sign weak demand ad we must work reduc inventori level machineri manufactur said sale backlog decreas furlough portion workforc result maker miscellan manufactur good report level product lower due decreas demand product stock wall street trade higher dollar littl chang basket currenc us treasuri price fell weak order govern data last week show manufactur contract annual rate first quarter declin come longlast manufactur good feder reserv maintain benchmark overnight interest rate current rang sinc last juli financi market expect us central bank start eas cycl septemb though policymak recent adopt hawkish outlook fed hike polici rate basi point sinc quell inflat ism survey forwardlook new order subindex rose stillsubdu read may output factori decreas first time sinc februari product subindex fell may inflat factori gate much cooler survey measur price paid manufactur drop lowest read sinc decemb may declin good price account much unchang read month inflat may decreas input price last month bode well continu disinflationari trend broader economi reinforc fourth straight month faster deliveri perform supplier manufactur the improv suppli chain ought view favor fed term rebalanc demand suppli good said conrad dequadro senior econom advisor brean capit factori employ slip briefli rebound may amid layoff attrit hire freez overal labor market gradual cool govern like report friday nonfarm payrol increas job june surg may accord reuter survey economist unemploy rate forecast unchang higher borrow cost also chip away growth construct sector boost demand new home amid shortag previous own hous sale separ report commerc depart census bureau monday show construct spend dip may upward revis increas april economist forecast construct spend rebound previous report fall april invest residenti construct drop surg april mortgag rate retreat may lofti level hous suppli improv consider demand slacken could limit growth new construct the perpetu highforlong interest rate polici boost benchmark year fix mortgag rate back spring demand hous appear soften respons across rang measur said michael hanson economist jpmorgan we see like pullback residenti construct second half year
