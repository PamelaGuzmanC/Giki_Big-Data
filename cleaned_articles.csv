Marco Bello | Reuters

President Joe Biden's raspy, unfocused, often inarticulate and widely panned debate performance stoked deep anxiety among Democrats — and caused some commentators and fundraisers to openly call for a new nominee to run against former President Donald Trump. But replacing Biden as the party's pick less than five months out from Election Day carries enormous political risks and would be difficult, if not impossible, to pull off. Right now, the only likely way Biden could be replaced is if he willingly ends his campaign. And Biden's aides and top Democratic officials say the 81-year-old incumbent has no plans to do so. If he did drop out, Democrats have yet to identify a clear alternative candidate to swap in. But the panic among donors and party officials after watching Biden falter Thursday night in his debate against Trump has led some of them to take steps to get Biden out of the race. There are already discussions among Democratic fundraisers about trying to convince congressional leaders — Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer in particular — to urge Biden to announce to drop out, according to people familiar with the matter who were granted anonymity to speak freely.

Schumer, D-N.Y., is a top target for donors making that pitch because he privately has voiced concerns about Biden's standings in presidential election polls, those people said. Schumer was worried before the debate that Biden and Trump were statistically tied nationally, despite the Republican challenger's conviction in his New York criminal hush money trial. A spokesman for Schumer declined to comment to CNBC but pointed to a social media post the majority leader published after the debate. Schumer in that X post wrote: ""Tonight's debate made the choice clear: Four more years of progress, or four more years of attacks on our fundamental rights and our democracy."" ""We've got to get out the vote for Joe Biden, Kamala Harris, and a Democratic Senate and House!"" the post said. That spin has not alleviated the post-debate anxiety felt by some of the president's top fundraisers. Some of those wealthy donors have lost trust in Biden's team, believing they were given false assurances about Biden's ability to take on Trump. And some of those donors who already planned to attend a high-dollar fundraiser Saturday in the Hamptons section of Long Island say they will attend the event to judge for themselves whether Biden can continue as a viable candidate. ""Democrats are in a very difficult situation because it's late in the campaign for a change,"" said Meena Bose, director of the Peter S. Kalikow Center for the Study of the American Presidency at Hofstra University, in an interview with CNBC. The only feasible way Bose could see it playing out is with Biden throwing his full support behind Vice President Kamala Harris to become the new nominee.

Otherwise, Democrats have a wide-open nomination fight just a few months before the Nov. 5 election, she said. Bose called that a ""disastrous"" prospect."" ""Vice President Harris is a risky choice, but certainly has the visibility and is the logical choice,"" said Bose. ""It's difficult to see how you open up the Democratic presidential nomination now and have a unified path to victory in November,"" she added.

However, even if Biden backed Harris to replace him ahead of the Democratic National Convention in August, there is no guarantee that the delegates he has won so far will shift their support to her. Biden has won nearly all of the roughly 4,000 Democratic-pledged delegates, far exceeding the threshold to make him the party nominee. If Biden refuses to drop out before August, the only opportunity to boot him as nominee would be at the Democratic National Convention that month. It is technically possible that Biden's delegates could abandon him en masse then and throw open the convention to nominate another candidate. Some Democrats who want an alternative to Biden but are concerned about Harris' relatively low opinion polls and rocky campaign history have looked to California Gov. Gavin Newsom, Ohio Sen. Sherrod Brown, Illinois Gov. J.B. Pritzker and others as possible contenders.

But blocking Biden from the nomination is highly improbable, as delegates tend to be strong supporters of their chosen candidate. ""That is probably the worst-case scenario,"" Bose said. ""If the Democrats are going to have a change at the top of the ticket, President Biden has to endorse it and, frankly, probably initiate it."" The DNC rules allow for the party to select another presidential nominee, but only in the ""event of death, resignation or disability"" that leaves the role vacant.

CNBC,https://www.cnbc.com/2024/06/28/new-york-times-editorial-board-urges-biden-to-drop-out-of-presidential-race.html,2024-06-29,00:02:57 UTC,New York Times editorial board urges Biden to drop out of presidential race,"U.S. President Joe Biden pauses during the CNN Presidential Debate at the CNN Studios on June 27, 2024 in Atlanta, Georgia. President Biden and Republican presidential candidate, former U.S. President Donald Trump are facing off in the first presidential debate of the 2024 campaign.

The New York Times editorial board on Friday urged President Joe Biden to exit the presidential election contest against Donald Trump, citing the Democrat's poor debate performance the previous night.

""The president appeared on Thursday night as the shadow of a great public servant,"" the Times editorial said. ""He struggled to explain what he would accomplish in a second term. He struggled to respond to Mr. Trump's provocations. He struggled to hold Mr. Trump accountable for his lies, his failures and his chilling plans. More than once, he struggled to make it to the end of a sentence.""

""Mr. Biden has said that he is the candidate with the best chance of taking on this threat of tyranny and defeating it. His argument rests largely on the fact that he beat Mr. Trump in 2020,"" it said. ""That is no longer a sufficient rationale for why Mr. Biden should be the Democratic nominee this year.""

The stunning editorial came a day after Biden gave a blundering performance in his first debate against Trump in the 2024 White House race.

''It should be remembered that Mr. Biden challenged Mr. Trump to this verbal duel,'' the editorial said. ""He set the rules, and he insisted on a date months earlier than any previous general election debate. He understood that he needed to address longstanding public concerns about his mental acuity and that he needed to do so as soon as possible.""

""The truth Mr. Biden needs to confront now is that he failed his own test.""

The editorial comes as a number of Democrats and fundraisers consider pushing for Biden to step aside in the contest.

The Times editorial board for decades has been the leading liberal newspaper editorial voice in the United States.

But in recent years, the paper's news section has been criticized by some liberals for its coverage of Hillary Clinton, the 2016 Democratic nominee, and Biden.","President Biden and Republican presidential candidate, former U.S. President Donald Trump are facing off in the first presidential debate of the 2024 campaign.

CNBC,https://www.cnbc.com/2024/06/28/biden-student-loan-payment-pause.html,2024-06-28,21:38:18 UTC,Student loan payments go on pause for millions of borrowers,"U.S. President Joe Biden is flanked by U.S. Secretary of Education Miguel Cardona as he speaks about administration plans to forgive federal student loan debt during remarks in the Roosevelt Room at the White House in Washington on Aug. 24, 2022.

The Biden administration is pausing student loan payments for about three million borrowers who are enrolled in its new repayment plan as it defends the program in court against Republican-backed lawsuits.

Those who have signed up for The Saving on a Valuable Education, or SAVE plan, and have a monthly payment above $0 will not owe anything on their debt for the time being, the U.S. Department of Education told CNBC.

Earlier this week, two federal judges in Kansas and Missouri temporarily halted significant parts of President Joe Biden's SAVE plan.

The preliminary injunctions are a result of lawsuits filed earlier this year by Republican-led states, including Florida, Arkansas and Missouri. The states argued that the Biden administration was overstepping its authority and trying to find a roundabout way to forgive student debt after the Supreme Court blocked its sweeping plan last year.

Under the SAVE plan, many borrowers pay just 5% of their discretionary income toward their debt each month, and its guidelines state anyone making $32,800 or less has a $0 monthly payment. It also expedited the timeline after which many borrowers receive the full cancellation of their debt.","The Biden administration is pausing student loan payments for about three million borrowers who are enrolled in its new repayment plan as it defends the program in court against Republican-backed lawsuits.

CNBC,https://www.cnbc.com/2024/06/28/supreme-court-trump-steve-bannon-jail-contempt-case.html,2024-06-28,20:44:36 UTC,Supreme Court rejects bid by former Trump aide Steve Bannon to avoid jail in Jan. 6 contempt case,"Former White House chief strategist Stephen Bannon gestures as he speaks to members of the media while leaving the federal courthouse after a judge ordered him to surrender by July 1 to begin serving his four-month prison term, in Washington on June 6, 2024.

The Supreme Court on Friday rejected a last-ditch effort by former Trump White House aide Steve Bannon to avoid reporting to jail next week while he appeals his conviction for defying a subpoena from a House committee investigating the Jan. 6, 2021, U.S. Capitol riot.

Bannon, 70, is due to begin serving a four-month jail sentence for contempt of Congress on Monday.

The Supreme Court in its unsigned, one-sentence order Friday said Bannon's ""application for release pending appeal presented to The Chief Justice [John Roberts] and by him referred to the Court is denied.""

The court in March rejected a similar request from Peter Navarro, another ex-advisor to former President Donald Trump, who also had been sentenced to four months in jail for defying a subpoena from the Jan. 6 House investigative panel. Navarro will soon complete serving his sentence.

An attorney for Bannon did not immediately respond to CNBC's request for comment on the Supreme Court's order.

Bannon was convicted in July 2022 of two counts of contempt of Congress after a trial in U.S. District Court in Washington, D.C. His jail sentence was stayed in October 2022 pending an appeal of his conviction.

Last month, a three-judge federal appeals court panel upheld his conviction, rejecting an argument that Bannon did not break the law because his attorney had advised him not to comply with the Jan. 6 committee's subpoena because of the chance his testimony could be blocked by a claim of executive privilege.

Bannon is expected to ask the full appeals court in Washington, D.C., to rehear the appeal of his conviction. But the district judge in his case, Carl Nichols, on June 6 ordered him to report to jail to begin his sentence.

Last week, Bannon asked the Supreme Court to suspend his surrender date pending his appeal. Friday's order by the high court rejected that bid, making it all but certain that Bannon will serve his sentence before his appeals are exhausted.

The bipartisan House panel was formed to investigate the Jan. 6 insurrection, when a violent mob of Trump's supporters stormed the U.S. Capitol and forced Congress to delay certifying President Joe Biden's 2020 election victory.

The committee set its sights on Bannon in light of reporting that on Jan. 5, 2021, he had predicted that ""all hell is going to break loose"" the following day, and that he was involved in talks about how to overturn the election results.","The Supreme Court on Friday rejected a last-ditch effort by former Trump White House aide Steve Bannon to avoid reporting to jail next week while he appeals his conviction for defying a subpoena from a House committee investigating the Jan. 6, 2021, U.S. Capitol riot.

Markets: Wall Street is ending the final day of the second quarter on a muted note, even after the Federal Reserve's preferred inflation gauge showed a further cooling off in May . The S & P 500 and Nasdaq Composite were flat in afternoon trading. The indexes, which are trying for a fourth consecutive day of gains, began the day higher. After minor advances Wednesday and Thursday, the Dow Jones Industrial Average was slightly lower, weighed down, in part, by Nike 's ugly earnings report. The sneaker company's shares fell 20%. Quarter end : The Dow is on track for a losing second quarter, down nearly 2% over the three-month timeframe. The 30-stock Dow had advanced in back-to-back quarters. Meanwhile, the S & P 500 and tech-heavy Nasdaq are up about 4% and 9%, respectively, in the April-to-June period. That will be the third straight positive quarter for the indexes and the fifth over the past six. Investor optimism around artificial intelligence stocks once again took center stage in the second quarter. It fueled huge gains for the likes of Club names Nvidia , Apple and Broadcom , even when factoring in the recent for volatility for some AI winners. Disney on radar: Shares of Club name Disney dropped 3% on Friday, breaching the $100 level that Jim Cramer has in recent weeks identified as a favorable price to buy more stock. ""I am contemplating buying back some of the Disney we sold much higher when we are [not restricted] sometime next week,"" Jim said Friday. Jim's comments come as Wall Street is surveying the implications of Thursday night's presidential debate , which was widely seen as strengthening former President Donald Trump's chances of recapturing the White House in November. ""I know people might think that Disney is too 'woke' under a Trump regime, but I care more about how there could be a lot of M & A in media and Disney could benefit,"" he said. Future of the Fed: Cramer has been a vocal supporter of Fed Chairman Jerome Powell and the job he's been doing. However, he said Friday: ""Before you get too excited, remember, Powell is one of the first people to go. Trump has disliked him intensely even know he's his guy."" Powell became Fed chairman in 2018 during the Trump presidency. But Trump almost immediately turned on Powell, lashing out at him in the fall of 2018 when the U.S. central bank started raising interest rates. His criticism continued during the final two years of his presidency . With much of the stock market discussion centered around what the Fed may or may not do, a change in Fed chair under Trump would likely shape rate policy in a different light. Solar praise: Analysts at Susquehanna offered upbeat commentary Friday on our newest stock: Nextracker , which joined the portfolio a day earlier . The firm initiated coverage of the maker of solar-tracking systems with a $59 price target and a buy-equivalent rating. While analysts were also positive on Nextracker competitor Array , they told clients they view the Club holding as a ""safer pick due to its leading market share, greater exposure to Tier 1 suppliers, geographic diversity, and cash generation."" Nextracker shares traded around $47 each Friday, down more than 4% as the broader solar cohort came under pressure. The debate Thursday may be one driver of the selling. Trump is considered more favorable to the oil-and-gas industry, while President Joe Biden has championed clean-energy policies. Jim on Friday downplayed concerns that Nextracker would struggle in a hypothetical second Trump term. ""That's quite wrong,"" he said. ""Nextracker is industrial solar. Now, who wants industrial solar? The big mega caps — Microsoft and Alphabet and Amazon — because they are levered to commitments that they gave, not anything having to do with the president, for being carbon free, or at least reducing their [carbon] footprint."" Microsoft, Alphabet and Amazon also are Club holdings. As usual, we started with a small stake in Nextracker, at just a 0.5% weighting, which gives us room to add more shares over time. Our price target is $55 a share. Up next: On Friday evening, our two bank stocks, Wells Fargo and Morgan Stanley , may provide updated capital return programs after passing the Fed's annual stress tests earlier this week.

The future of Social Security and Medicare may be greatly impacted by whoever occupies the White House following the November presidential election.

When asked during Thursday night's presidential debate who is the biggest risk to those programs, President Joe Biden and former President Donald Trump pointed to each other.

Biden said Trump wants to ""get rid of"" Social Security and cut Medicare.

Trump said Biden is ""destroying"" those programs.

Social Security provides monthly income to more than 72 million beneficiaries, including retired and disabled workers and families. Medicare provides health coverage to more than 65 million Americans age 65 and over.

With more than 11,000 Americans now turning 65 every day, according to estimates from the Retirement Income Institute at the Alliance for Lifetime Income, more retirees are relying on support from both programs.

When voters age 50 and up were asked how important Social Security is to their vote this November, 80% said it is extremely important or very important, a recent AARP survey found.

While those voters want a candidate who will protect the program, their support is still up for grabs, according to the results.

Both Biden and Trump moved to win those voters on Thursday. Here's what they said.","Republican presidential candidate former U.S. President Donald Trump and Democratic Party presidential candidate U.S. President Joe Biden speak during a presidential debate in Atlanta, Georgia, U.S., June 27, 2024 in a combination photo.

Jason Armond | Los Angeles Times | Getty Images

Consumers aren't sacrificing dining out, even with prices on the rise — but they are getting more savvy about managing those bills. The majority of Americans surveyed, 81%, say they are dining out once a month or more and 31% say they dine out once a week or more, according to new research from e-commerce provider Lightspeed Commerce Inc . Even though inflation has slowed significantly from its pandemic-era peak, consumers still feeling the financial squeeze are opting for takeout, value meals and happy hour deals, the report found. The consumer price index, which gauges how fast prices are changing in the U.S. economy, shows food prices at restaurants have been growing faster than grocery store items — but finance experts have tips for stretching your dollar.

""While Americans are still dining out, they are also looking for ways to keep dining fun and affordable amidst changing economic conditions. It's all about value for diners — they're looking to enjoy eating out, but at a good price,"" Lightspeed CEO Dax Dasilva said. Lightspeed surveyed 1,500 Americans in May as part of an international survey that included 7,500 overall responses.

Higher meal prices and 'shrinkflation'

U.S. diners are noticing rising prices when the server drops off their bill, with 69% in the Lightspeed survey reporting pricier meals. Some said they're seeing ""shrinkflation"" in action, with 39% noticing their favorite dishes shrinking in size even as the prices remain the same or increase. Even with a jump in prices, about half of respondents said they will continue to dine out at the same rate or increase their frequency of restaurant visits. Ted Jenkin, a certified financial planner and CEO of oXYGen Financial Inc. in Atlanta, said consumer dining trends could be a lingering effect from the aftermath of the pandemic.

Biden's new student loan relief plan is on pause. What to know

Homeowners typically spend nearly $55,000 to sell a home ""It started with revenge travel, and then it was followed by revenge shopping. And now I think it's just a way that people are living their life with this mentality of 'I'm going to just enjoy my life today, because I don't know what tomorrow is going to bring me,'"" said Jenkin, who is a member of the CNBC Advisor Council. ""And I think there's been some permanency to that."" Nearly half of U.S. diners, 45%, are being more frugal by asking for to-go boxes to enjoy leftovers later, according to Lightspeed. Meanwhile, 43% are hunting for deals with coupons, 39% are choosing value meals and 36% are taking advantage of happy hour specials.

Past the 'tipping point of tipping'

One way consumers say inflation is impacting their dining habits is through tipping. Of those surveyed, 44% of consumers said inflation has affected their ability to tip. The majority of diners surveyed, 73%, say they're not happy when the cashier flips around a tablet screen to reveal auto-tipping options. ""I think when times were better, you definitely saw more people being more comfortable at the iPad paying tip,"" said Winnie Sun, co-founder and managing director of Irvine, California-based Sun Group Wealth Partners. She is also a member of the CNBC Advisor Council. ""Nowadays, consumers are fed up with having to tip at places that they don't normally tip at,"" she added.

When looking at scenarios outside of sit-down restaurants, consumers are more likely to tip delivery drivers (61%), than baristas at coffee shops (28%) or an employee working behind a counter (19%). ""People have passed the tipping point of tipping. I think people are willing to tip when they go out to a real service-based restaurant,"" Jenkin said. ""The days of going in and having to pay for a $7 coffee and leaving a $2 tip are, I think, are getting smaller and smaller as consumers are feeling the bite at their wallet.""

China: 'Starkly different visions' of America

China's CGTN, the English-language service of state-run China Global Television Network, said: ""Biden started hesitantly and Trump answered steadily in a halting clash."" Accusations of lies and that each of them was the worst-ever U.S. president, were rife, the outlet said. Meanwhile, the South China Morning Post said that the two ""presented starkly different visions for America's place in the world,"" and that it was a ""high-stakes debate."" Before it kicked off, China's state-backed tabloid Global Times said it was expected to be ""like a reality show.""

India: 'Democrats in full-blown panic'

The Times of India led its story with concerns from Democrats about Biden's performance, with the headline reading: ""'We are f***ed': Democrats in full-blown panic over Joe Biden's debate performance."" Biden ""delivered a shaky, halting performance,"" it said, while ""Trump battered him with a series of often false attacks."" Elsewhere, India Today said Biden ""stammered and fumbled"" multiple times, while describing Trump's performance as ""forceful and aggressive.""

UK: 'Biden struggles ... Trump lies'

In the U.K., the Guardian pointed to issues with both Biden and Trump at the debate, headlining its story: ""Biden struggles to land lines as Trump lies in first presidential debate."" Many of Trump's replies to straightforward questions had little to do with the topic at hand, the paper said, and he made frequent false claims which were not fact-checked by the moderators. Biden, meanwhile, ""frequently struggled to complete his thoughts."" The Times of London said that Biden's reelection campaign was ""plunged into crisis"" following the debate and that the current president's responses to questions were ""meandering and muddled,"" while Trump's were ""more assured and disciplined."" Meanwhile, the BBC suggested Biden struggled with Trump's attacks, titling its live blog of the debate: ""Biden stumbles in first presidential debate as Trump avoids key questions."" Biden struggled repeatedly and Trump repeated falsehoods, it said, adding that the debate was ""marked by personal attacks.""

Germany: 'True losers ... are the Americans'

Germany's broadcaster ZDF described the debate as ""more civilized"" but ""more charged"" than in 2020, adding that Trump had a better start, but Biden caught up later on, according to a CNBC translation. At first, Biden did not appear very agile and hesitated, it said, but added that his tone was ""somewhat surprisingly"" as aggressive and sharp as Trump's. On individual topics, Biden had ""clear words"" for Trump when it came to abortion, but things got ""uncomfortable"" for him on immigration — while Trump tried to dodge questions about the January 2021 Capitol Hill riot.

Sueddeutsche Zeitung, meanwhile, titled one of its stories: ""Joe Biden's bad evening,"" saying that even though his answers had more substance than Trump's, Biden's verbal stumbling raised concerns. In another story, the newspaper summarized the debate: ""Biden disgraces himself, Trump wastes his chance, but the true losers of the first TV debate in the U.S. election campaigns are the Americans.""

CNBC,https://www.cnbc.com/2024/06/28/biden-democratic-fundraisers-sound-alarm-on-debate.html,2024-06-28,17:00:19 UTC,Top Democratic fundraisers sound the alarm after Biden's debate performance,"President Joe Biden delivers remarks during the CNN Presidential Debate at the CNN Studios on June 27, 2024 in Atlanta, Georgia.

""Biden's got to leave. He's got to get out now and if he doesn't get out we're going to get f------ crushed,"" said the advisor. They told CNBC they planned to approach Democratic National Committee Chairman Jaime Harrison on Friday to discuss what happened at the debate.

""Game over,"" said a longtime Democratic campaign advisor, who has been raising money for congressional leaders for over a decade and helped raise money for Biden's 2020 White House bid.

CNBC began hearing from worried Democratic campaign donors and fundraisers less than 20 minutes into the 90-minute debate hosted by CNN.

""This is terrible. Worse than I thought was possible. Everyone I'm speaking with thinks Biden should drop out,"" said the person, who was granted anonymity in order to recount private conversations.

""Disaster,"" said a Biden donor who plans to attend a fundraiser with the president on Saturday in the Hamptons .

Many of the Democratic Party's top fundraisers are privately sounding the alarm after President Joe Biden 's disappointing debate performance Thursday against Republican former President Donald Trump .

An advisor of one of the Democratic Party's top megadonors called the debate an ""absolute train wreck"" for Biden. ""Worse than [Ronald] Reagan in '84 or [George W.] Bush in '04 or [Barack] Obama in '12,"" they added.

The problems for Biden at the debate started early. He stumbled out of the gate, appearing to lose his train of thought at times and pausing for a long moment before CNN moderators cut him off when he was discussing U.S. health care.

""Making sure that we're able to make every single solitary person eligible for what I've been able to do with the, with the Covid, excuse me, with dealing with everything we have to do with, look ..."" Biden said, trailing off.

""Look, if, we've finally beat Medicare,"" Biden said, before CNN anchor and moderator Jack Tapper gently moved on. ""Thank you, President Biden,"" said Tapper.

Several times later in the debate, the president repeated himself, or left several seconds of silence mid-answer. Throughout the evening, Biden's voice was raspy and quiet.

Biden's campaign co-chair Mitch Landrieu told NBC News this was because the president had a cold. ""I think because of the way people analyze debates, it's going to be at first about the physical performance,"" said Landrieu.

Even Vice President Kamala Harris acknowledged that Biden was not in top form. ""Yes, it was a slow start, but it was a strong finish,"" she said on CNN late Thursday.

For example, answering a question about border security — a top voter issue this election cycle — Biden's sentence was grammatically difficult to follow.

""I'm going to continue to move until we get the total ban on the total initiative relative to what we're going to do with more Border Patrol and more asylum officers,"" Biden said.

Trump pounced on the stumbles. ""I don't know what he said at the end of that sentence. I don't think he knows what he said, either,"" the former president quipped.

Representatives for the Biden campaign did not respond to requests for comment.

Replacing Biden on the ticket now would be extremely difficult, with less than two months until the Democratic National Convention in August. The president would effectively have to drop out of the race, leaving the decision about a nominee up to the delegates at the convention.

""It was a really disappointing debate performance from Joe Biden, I don't think there's any other way to slice it,"" Kate Bedingfield, former White House communications director in the Biden administration until 2023, said on CNN.

""His biggest issue was to prove to the American people that he had the energy, the stamina — and he didn't do that,"" she said.","President Joe Biden delivers remarks during the CNN Presidential Debate at the CNN Studios on June 27, 2024 in Atlanta, Georgia.

CNBC,https://www.cnbc.com/2024/06/28/marketplace-health-insurance-more-expensive.html,2024-06-28,18:16:44 UTC,Marketplace health insurance may get more expensive — unless Congress extends this tax break,"If you buy health insurance via the federal marketplace, your premiums could increase significantly after 2025 — unless Congress takes action.

The premium tax credit makes health insurance purchased via the marketplace more affordable. Participants can use the credit to lower insurance premiums upfront or claim the tax break when filing their return.

The credit was temporarily enhanced via the American Rescue Plan Act during the Covid-19 pandemic. The legislation covered plans in 2021 and 2022, but the Inflation Reduction Act extended that benefit through 2025.

If the benefits sunset after 2025, ""virtually everybody would face higher premiums,"" according to Gideon Lukens, senior fellow and director of research and data analysis for the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities, who wrote about the expirations this month.

The White House in January reported record-high enrollment in marketplace plans for 2024, with more than 21 million participants.

In his fiscal 2025 budget request, President Joe Biden proposed making the premium tax credit expansion permanent. He briefly plugged the program's benefits for communities of color during the first presidential debate on Thursday.

However, making the program permanent would increase the federal budget deficit by $335 billion from 2025 to 2034, according to the Congressional Budget Office and Joint Committee on Taxation.

Former President Donald Trump's campaign did not respond to CNBC's request for comment on the program.","If you buy health insurance via the federal marketplace, your premiums could increase significantly after 2025 — unless Congress takes action.
The premium tax credit makes health insurance purchased via the marketplace more affordable.
Participants can use the credit to lower insurance premiums upfront or claim the tax break when filing their return.

Of the 400 investors, traders and money managers polled, 67% said Trump would be better for stocks than President Joe Biden. The S&P 500 rose 68% during Trump's four years in office versus the 44% gain so far under Biden's administration. The Nasdaq jumped 137% during Trump's administration, compared with a 34% gain for Biden three and a half years into his four-year term.

The performance of the Federal Reserve is likely to be a big issue this election season as well as the debate over inflation, and what to do about it.

Seventy-seven percent of the survey respondents said they trusted the central bank to do right by the American economy, but 23% said they didn't trust the Fed. Two-thirds said they believe the Fed will cut interest rates before the end of this year, but 23% disagreed, saying there'll be no cut in 2024. Ten percent of respondents said they would urge the Fed to cut at the next meeting on July 30-31.

The 400 money managers who took the survey were evenly split on where they stand on the direction of the S&P 500 and Nasdaq. A third expect we'll have a 5% or more drop by autumn. A third said the markets will be up 5% or more by then. And another third said we're likely to remain range-bound. Both indexes are trading at record high levels, with the S&P 500 up more than 15% since the start of the year, while the Nasdaq has climbed nearly 20%.

A vast majority, some 80%, said they were uncomfortable with how tech heavy the major indexes have become to the point where it makes them nervous.

A big part of those jitters come from Nvidia's rise. The stock is up more than 150% in 2024, but down about 12% from its 52-week high as of Thursday's close.

The Russian leader was invoked roughly a dozen times in the 90-minute volley of verbal blows on domestic and foreign policy between the two candidates. Both have navigated the White House relationship with the Kremlin for a mandate each and shared very different views of the Russian leader.

Trump — who has denied accusations that Moscow interfered in his favor in the 2016 election — claimed that Putin would be deterred from conflict if he respected the leadership of opposing global superpowers.

""As far as Russia and Ukraine, if we had a real president, a president that knew — that was respected by Putin, he would have never — he would have never invaded Ukraine,"" Trump said, according to a CNN transcript of the debate.

Dubbing Ukrainian leader Volodymyr Zelenskyy as ""the greatest salesman ever,"" Trump again criticized the extent of U.S. financial support for Kyiv throughout the conflict. Two months ago, Washington approved a foreign aid bill that earmarked roughly $60 billion for the war-torn country.

""I will have that war settled between Putin and Zelenskyy as president-elect before I take office on January 20th. I'll have that war settled,"" Trump said, without disclosing any details.

Trump said, however, that Putin's latest demands for peace negotiations to begin — which include the withdrawal of Kyiv's forces from Ukrainian territories illegally annexed by Russia — are ""not acceptable.""

In a separate pledge, Trump vowed to ensure the release of Wall Street Journal reporter Evan Gershkovich, who was detained in Russia in March 2023 and now faces trial on charges of espionage.

""I will have him out very quickly, as soon as I take office, before I take office,"" Trump said, noting that Putin is ""probably asking for billions of dollars for the reporter."" The Russian leader has previously signaled interest in a potential prisoner swap for Gershkovich, rather than in financial compensation.

Zelenskyy has previously called Trump's claim that he could end the Ukraine war in 24 hours ""very dangerous"" and appeared apprehensive over a potential White House return of the Republican candidate.","Both have navigated the White House relationship with the Kremlin for a mandate each and shared very different views of the Russian leader.

CNBC,https://www.cnbc.com/2024/06/27/goodrx-tracker-drug-prices-rise.html,2024-06-27,22:10:55 UTC,"Drug prices have risen almost 40% over the past decade, according to a new tracker","The cost of prescription medications in the U.S. has increased 37% since 2014, far surpassing the rate of inflation, according to data from drug savings company GoodRx .

Though the price increases have slowed this year in comparison to the past decade, the higher costs are raising out-of-pocket expenses for consumers. The average American spends $16.26 out of pocket per prescription, according to the data.

""When things increase … inevitably, they do trickle down to consumers, especially those who are in a high deductible plan or who don't have insurance or find themselves paying substantially out of pocket,"" said GoodRx director of research Tori Marsh.

GoodRx said the patients' share of the cost continues to grow due to rising copays, coinsurances and deductibles. The company found that over the past 10 years, the average person's deductible nearly doubled, and copays are rising as the majority of plans are adding another tier of drugs with higher copays.

It is a dynamic GoodRx deems ""the big pinch."" High medication costs are coupled with reduced insurance coverage. Analyzing coverage for more than 3,700 Medicare Part D plans between 2010 and 2024, GoodRx found that the portion of medications covered dropped 19% during that period.

""The impact is really kind of threefold,"" Marsh said. ""Rising costs or rising prices are a big part of it, but it's really that with the combination of increased friction. … It's hard for people to, in some ways, access their medication or access a pharmacy. And then on top of that, insurance is not what it used to be. It's not covering as much as it used to.""

On average, Americans pay two to three times more for prescription drugs than consumers in other developed countries, according to the White House.

Drug costs have become a focus for President Joe Biden, particularly as he approaches the 2024 election. The Biden administration has taken several measures to lower out-of-pocket drug expenses.

On Wednesday, the White House announced it would lower prices on 64 prescription drugs for some Medicare beneficiaries as a result of inflation penalties on drugmakers.

The lower costs, effective during the third quarter, will benefit roughly 750,000 people who use the drugs annually, some of whom could save up to $4,593 per day, according to the release.

""Despite efforts by policymakers and industry leaders to break down affordability and accessibility barriers, a patient's actual out-of-pocket cost continues to increase and is often a huge surprise to them,"" said GoodRx interim CEO Scott Wagner in a news release.

The Biden administration on Wednesday said it will impose inflation penalties on 64 prescription drugs for the third quarter of this year, lowering costs for certain older Americans enrolled in Medicare.

President Joe Biden has made lowering U.S. drug prices a key pillar of his health-care agenda and reelection platform for 2024. A provision of Biden's Inflation Reduction Act requires drugmakers to pay rebates to Medicare, the federal health program for Americans over age 65, if they hike the price of a medication faster than the rate of inflation.

It is separate from another provision under the law that allows Medicare to negotiate lower prescription drug prices with manufacturers. On average, Americans pay two to three times more than patients in other developed nations for prescription drugs, according to the Biden administration.

Some patients will pay a lower coinsurance rate for the 64 drugs covered under Wednesday's announcement, which fall under Medicare Part B, for the period from July 1 to Sept. 30 ""since each drug company raised prices faster than the rate of inflation,"" according to a release from the administration.

Some Medicare Part B patients may save as much as $4,593 per day if they use those drugs during the quarter, the release added.

More than 750,000 Medicare patients use the drugs each year, according to the release. The medications treat conditions such as cancer, certain infections and a bone disease called osteoporosis.

The list includes Bristol Myers Squibb's Abecma, a cell therapy for multiple myeloma; and Pfizer's targeted cancer treatment for certain lymphomas called Adectris. It also includes Astellas Pharma and Pfizer's Padcev, a targeted cancer treatment for advanced bladder cancer.

The Biden administration said Padcev's price has increased faster than inflation every quarter since the Medicare inflation rebate program went into effect last year.","The Biden administration on Wednesday said it will impose inflation penalties on 64 prescription drugs for the third quarter of this year, lowering costs for certain older Americans enrolled in Medicare.

Delta Air Lines is the country's most profitable airline. CEO Ed Bastian's challenge is to make sure his carrier stays on top. The airline's unit revenue, the amount it brings in for every seat it flies one mile, outpaced its competitors' last year. Delta's share price has soared more than 17% in 2024, one of the strongest performers in the rocky airline sector, in a rally that's outdone the S&P 500 's. It expects free cash flow to rise as much as 50% this year to between $3 billion and $4 billion, and is eyeing a return to an investment-grade credit rating. And a stat any traveler would appreciate: Delta came in first in punctuality last year, with more than 83% of its flights arriving on time, according to the Transportation Department. Rival United Airlines — second to Delta in net profit margins — is circling. It says it could grow profit even more this year. ""Knowing that there's someone that thinks that they can take that mantle from us, that keeps us on our toes and keeps us continuing to drive hard,"" Bastian told CNBC.

Delta has fashioned itself as America's premium airline. It has won over hordes of splurging travelers, many of them carrying American Express cards, Delta's cash cow of a partner that generated almost $7 billion for the airline last year. Sales growth of Delta's roomier and more expensive seats continues to outpace revenue from standard coach. As they vie for luxury flyers, both Delta and United have added more high-end seating to their planes to cater to travelers who deem worthwhile a $300 surcharge for a few inches of extra legroom on a cross-country round trip, or 10 times as much for a seat in business class. Bastian, a former auditor who said he took his first flight at age 25 for a business trip (New York to Chicago), is in charge of ensuring Delta lives up to its brand luster. On Wednesday, Delta took its next shot in the battle for high-spending flyers when it opened its newest, highest tier of airport lounge at New York's John F. Kennedy International Airport for passengers in its Delta One cabin, its top cabin that features lie-flat beds for longer flights. At more than 39,000 square feet it is Delta's largest lounge, accented with pillows that have the iconic zigzag motif of Italian fashion house Missoni, its new amenity kit partner. It features complimentary spa treatments, like ice globes and serum for jet-lagged eyes, along with showers, a full restaurant, and a deck overlooking the airfield, in a bet that travelers' desire to treat themselves is here to stay. Delta is taking a page from the playbooks of United and American , which already dedicate their swankiest lounges to customers flying in long-haul business class. Delta plans to open Delta One lounges in Boston and Los Angeles later this year, and is studying airports where it could open others. ""The thing with this industry is no good idea goes uncopied,"" said Raymond James airline analyst Savanthi Syth. Meanwhile, United is placing huge orders for new Boeing and Airbus planes and remodeling hundreds of narrow-body cabins that feature seatback screens and Bluetooth technology, a strategy that aims to cater to travelers from international business class to those flying on the cheapest basic economy tickets. ""We haven't exactly achieved the No. 1 profitability status in the industry, but I know we're on our way,"" United's chief commercial officer, Andrew Nocella, said in an interview last month. ""If we continue to invest in our customers through great service and great products and great network, we know that will feed upon itself and it'll help us achieve the financial results that we're looking for."" Delta, United and American are approaching their 100th birthdays, and are trying to stay ahead — if not drive — shifting travel demand and still turn a profit. United is adding to the more than 300 airports it serves. Figuring out the next hot destination is ""part art"" and ""part science,"" said Patrick Quayle, its head of network planning. The airline's sprawling global network makes United the biggest U.S. airline by capacity and it recently launched service to places like Dubrovnik, Croatia, and Amman, Jordan. Quayle pointed to United's addition of Cape Town, South Africa, which it first announced before the pandemic, as a success. ""Another airline has subsequently copied us. ... I might want to add based in Atlanta,"" he said, alluding to Delta's home city. The latest changes come at a difficult time for a lot of U.S. airlines. Labor and other costs swelled after the pandemic, eating into margins despite record numbers of travelers. Added capacity in the U.S. market has forced carriers to discount fares in off-peak travel periods. It's tricky, and expensive, to change course. Even Southwest Airlines is facing investor pressure to add things like premium seating or seat assignments as its simple, but long successful, business model shows signs of age.

Meanwhile, U.S. consumers are growing more selective: Some corporate leaders have lamented a spending pullback while others, like Delta's CEO, are saying the opposite. Americans are still digging into the so-called experiences economy, and paying for more comfort along the way, according to Bastian. ""They may not be buying that new EV or that new house, but they're saying we're going to go out and experience the world and invest in that experience,"" he said. ""And that's why you see it happening in high-end concerts, high-end hospitality.""

'Brick by brick'

When the U.S. was careening toward recession almost two decades ago, Delta's leaders made a correct bet that travelers would eventually pay more to fly on its jets. Delta was emerging from Chapter 11 bankruptcy in 2007, which other U.S. carriers found themselves in the years after the Sept. 11, 2001, terrorist attacks. Former CEO Richard Anderson said the airline had to start with basics: stop losing bags. Make sure flights didn't get canceled and arrived on time. Clean up the cabins. ""It was about building the operation brick by brick,"" said Anderson, who handed the reins to Delta's former president, Bastian, in 2016. ""It didn't matter what you did with AmEx. If the flight canceled, you ruined your brand."" Delta took better care to avoid maintenance problems. It also started ferrying planes to airports to avoid cancellations if a replacement aircraft was needed. And the carrier tried to clean up its image, hiring a marketing firm that advised former President Barack Obama's 2008 presidential campaign.

Anderson said the airline needed to be consistent and not fly its mix of paint jobs and cabin interiors. It faced fresh competition from low-cost airlines like a then-spritely upstart out of Queens, New York, called JetBlue Airways . Delta and United had both launched their own low-cost subsidiaries, but they discontinued them. Delta executives knew they needed a brand to match if they were going to command a premium over competitors. ""One of the things about being a premium product is consistency, consistency in policy, consistency in appearance,"" said Anderson. ""If you got on a flight in Tokyo we wanted you to feel like you were home."" After the string of changes, Delta's performance improved. Corporate business travel contracts helped boost profits and still do, as business travel returns post-pandemic. Delta had a key advantage over competitors. After it came out of bankruptcy, it merged with Northwest Airlines in 2008, allowing it to stabilize and expand around the world while other carriers floundered. The rest of the industry spent much of the next decade recovering from bankruptcies and a subsequent musical chairs of mergers that left four big carriers in control of about three-quarters of the U.S. domestic market. Delta's rivals were years behind the carrier on integrating their merged staff, operations, networks and fleets. Bastian said Delta's focus on reliability has made life easier for not just its customers, but also its employees. ""They're not having to explain for a cancellation or mishandled luggage,"" he said. ""They have time to serve rather than to apologize."" Delta is also unique as the least unionized of the major U.S. airlines, at about 20%. In April, as campaigns were underway to organize its flight attendants and other workers, it again raised worker pay. Flight attendants for Delta's regional carrier, Endeavor, which are unionized, have recently demanded compensation on par with the carrier's mainline flight attendants.

Time to remodel

After Delta got the basics down, Bastian, 67, who joined Delta in 1998, said it was time for the airline to focus on more ambitious projects. ""You had the liberty to start investing in premium,"" he said. ""You started to figure out how to make first class more available to customers."" It has expanded in big-spending New York and Los Angeles, the country's two largest air travel markets by revenue, according to aviation data firm OAG. Delta also built up its host of global alliances, joint ventures and minority ownership stakes, giving it more reach. That includes its 49% stake in Virgin Atlantic, which already had a strong foothold in premium air travel and popular lounges. ""I think some of that heritage has made its way into the core of Delta,"" said Virgin Atlantic's CEO, Shai Weiss. ""I'm not suggesting we are the messiah for Delta, but there is no surprise that Delta and Virgin Atlantic see eye to eye on many things."" The vast majority of the more than 940 million people who flew on U.S. airlines last year fly in coach, and Delta has tried to make its flights more desirable to travelers on all sections of the plane. It remodeled old and dated terminals, and built out its network of luxury airport lounges, which are tied to its lucrative credit card deal with American Express. It added seatback televisions and better in-flight entertainment options, and in February 2023, it announced its long-awaited free Wi-Fi to customers enrolled in its SkyMiles frequent flyer program.

Delta has invested more than $12 billion to rebuild and update its U.S. hubs with soaring ceilings, new technology and in some lounges, a signature scent. (""It's proprietary,"" said Claude Roussel, who oversees Delta's lounges, when asked what was in it.) One of its latest efforts is its terminal and new Sky Club at New York's LaGuardia Airport, alongside other airlines' new terminals. A decade ago, then-Vice President Joe Biden famously said someone who was blindfolded and taken to that airport would think, ""I must be in some third-world country."" The airline faced big problems along the way like a dayslong system outage in 2016. And the worst of all: Covid-19. Like other airlines, Delta accepted billions in federal aid to weather the pandemic. The carrier successfully urged some 17,000 workers to take buyouts, hiring newer, lower-paid staff who lacked the experience of departed employees. Early in the process, Bastian said the newer workers gave the company a ""juniority benefit."" The airline employed about 100,000 people in the U.S. as of the end of last year. Delta and its competitors also pulled out of many small cities as the pandemic eased, isolating some smaller cities amid a shortage of regional jet pilots. But international travel has proved resilient so far, as consumers show they are willing to shell out on experiences.

Luxury air travel? In the U.S.?

Luxury air travel and the United States didn't go together for many years — and might not still, if you ask well-heeled globetrotters. U.S. airlines don't offer on-board showers or roomy suites like those on the superjumbos flown by the likes of Etihad Airways or Singapore Airlines. But the U.S. air travel market, the world's largest, has gotten a number of upgrades in recent years, and travelers have grown to expect the same convenience they get from their online shopping sites and ride-hailing and food-ordering apps. ""Delta's not bougie by any stretch, but when your competitors don't try very hard, it doesn't take much,"" said Henry Harteveldt, a former airline executive and founder of Atmosphere Research Group. But as a rewards credit card boom, strong consumer spending, social media envy and a wanderlust that predated the pandemic combined to boost demand, airlines executives were taking notice. Delta's sales from premium products are growing faster than revenue from its main coach cabin, a trend the airline forecasts will continue. Sales from Delta's loyalty business, premium cabins and other streams comprise more than half of the carrier's revenue. Airlines have made big changes as they struggle to accommodate the swelling numbers of big-spending travelers armed with elite status. Major carriers have all overhauled their frequent flyer programs to reward the biggest spenders instead of those who fly the most miles, and made it harder to earn coveted elite status. And at Delta and other airlines, many of the perks for luxury flyers come through lounges. One of Delta's Sky Clubs at Los Angeles International Airport offers a separate, dedicated security checkpoint for customers flying Delta One, away from the masses at the airport. That feature will make it to the new JFK lounge later this year, a Delta spokesman said. United and American Airlines have also worked to glam up and expand their airport lounges, access to which is a common perk with credit cards. Delta softened some restrictions on Sky Club lounge access last year — which it made to end annoying and unsightly long lines to enter its exclusive airport real estate — after an uproar from customers.

'We're constantly pushing each other""

Both Delta and United have issued sunny financial forecasts for this year, while many carriers are losing money or not pulling in similar profit margins. ""Watching [Delta] succeed, I became convinced that the product mattered and service mattered, and we have done that at United now,"" United CEO Scott Kirby said at a JPMorgan industry conference in March. And at an investor conference last month, he pointed to how the two are pulling away from the rest of the pack in profitability, particularly at big hubs. United has made some big bets that paid off. It held onto its wide-body planes, when travel demand collapsed in the pandemic, and has benefited from the surge in international travel. With United on Delta's tail, Bastian is trying to expand the airline's reach. Bastian has attended the massive Consumer Electronics Show in Las Vegas and has announced new partnerships with Lyft and Starbucks for its loyalty program.

The annual survey conducted by the China General Chamber of Commerce in the U.S. found that nearly 60% of companies aim to maintain a stable level of investment and that about 30% plan to boost it.

""A notable degree of long-term optimism persisted, with the majority expressing positive future revenue expectations,"" CGCC said, adding that the survey reflected ""a commendable sense of optimism, determination, and resilience.""

The survey was conducted in April and May of this year, polling nearly 100 Chinese companies across various industries about performance and outlook.

The report said Chinese firms remain committed to the U.S. market despite growing negative sentiment about the overall business environment amid rising trade tensions between the world's two largest economies.

Over 60% of survey respondents saw a deteriorating business environment in the U.S. Meanwhile, the rate of concern regarding a ""stalemate in Sino-US bilateral relations political and cultural relations"" surged to 93% from 81% a year prior.

He went on to condemn the modern political left as “aggressively anti-common sense” during an interview with English journalist Tina Brown at the Aspen Ideas Festival in Colorado.

“Part of it the left has to own,” he told Brown. “They are aggressively anti-common sense. The Democrats keep running on this one idea, saying to the American people, ‘You can’t possibly think you can do worse than Donald Trump.’ And they keep saying, ‘Yes, we can. Yes, we can.'”

Maher went on to explain he has Democratic friends who have leftist children, many of whom, the comedian suggested, accuse their parents of “old thinking” and not understanding their progressive points of view.

“Tear down statues of Lincoln? Maybe give communism another shot? Get rid of the border patrol? Get rid of capitalism? White supremacy has never been worse? Gender is always just a social construct? It’s OK to have penises in the women’s swimming pool, in women’s prisons?” he said, listing a handful of the views held by leftists. “No, it’s not that I’m old; it’s that your ideas are stupid.”

Listen to the latest episode of “Quick Start”:

Maher explained to Brown that, if Democrats insist on embracing far-leftist ideals and refuse to collaborate in any way with Republicans who oppose Trump, they are only aiding the GOP in defeating incumbent President Joe Biden.

“That’s as good as it gets,” he said. “If you can’t talk to those people, you’re just abandoning the country to half the people who are even worse, who are going to vote for Trump this next time — and they are — and he very likely will win, and then what are we going to do?”

“I think we should keep the dialogue open,” the HBO’s “Real Time” host added.

Maher recently appeared on the ABC talk show “The View,” where he condemned those on the left who have chosen to vehemently oppose Israel and protest in support of Hamas.

“If I had any doubt that I was right about the change that’s happened in the left, watching people protest for a terrorist organization like Hamas — that straightened me out pretty quick,” he said, later adding, “It’s astounding to me that they can’t tell the good guys from the bad guys, just morally. If you’re for Hamas, just live in Gaza for a day … [even] before the war.”

Ultimately, he said the best way to stop Israel from retaliating is to “stop attacking Israel.”

In what's widely known as the Chevron case, the court took a step to curb the ability of the ballooning federal bureaucracy to bypass Congress with backdoor regulations.

In the other case, the high court issued a ruling about obstruction that could have a big impact on the future of President Trump and Capitol riot defendants.

The Chevron Case & the 'Deep State'



In a far-reaching decision, the Supreme Court upended the 40-year-old Chevron precedent that made it easier for federal government agencies to create their own rules on issues like the environment, public health, and business regulations.

The original Chevron decision allowed federal agencies to unilaterally fill in the details whenever government officials claimed the laws passed by Congress were too ambiguous.

Critics have argued for decades that only Congress has been given the power to legislate, so allowing bureaucrats broad power to invent thousands of regulations violates the U.S. Constitution. It's one of the reasons those critics have referred to the massive size of the federal government as the ""nanny state"" or even the ""deep state"" because unelected bureaucrats often seized that opportunity to operate autonomously from the legislative or judicial branches.

THE CHEVRON CASE David v Goliath: Small Businesses Fight Federal Bureaucracy at US Supreme Court

BREAKING: In a major blow to the unelected administrative state, the Supreme Court has overruled the Chevron doctrine, which required courts to defer to the legal interpretations of unelected bureaucrats.



“Chevron is overruled.” pic.twitter.com/tqC5EYaUBl — Sean Davis (@seanmdav) June 28, 2024

Chief Justice John Roberts wrote the court's opinion stating, ""Perhaps most fundamentally, Chevron's presumption is misguided because agencies have no special competence in resolving statutory ambiguities. Courts do.""

Tyler O'Neil, managing editor of the Daily Signal, wrote on X, ""This is a huge step forward for holding the administrative state—and the deep state—accountable.""

The Capitol Riot and Obstruction

In the other major case, the Supreme Court made it harder to charge Capitol riot defendants with obstruction, a charge that also has been brought against former President Donald Trump.

In a 6-3 ruling, the court ruled that charging someone with obstructing an official proceeding must include proof that defendants tried to tamper with or destroy documents. Only some of the people who breached the Capitol on Jan. 6, 2021, fall into that category, so many of those cases are expected to be affected by reduced sentencing.

Liberty Counsel Founder and Chairman Mat Staver said, ""This new narrow interpretation will make it difficult for these indictments to stand.""

Chief Justice John Roberts wrote Friday's decision, joined by Justices Samuel Alito, Neil Gorsuch, Brett Kavanaugh, and Clarence Thomas, and by Biden nominee Justice Ketanji Brown Jackson.

It's unclear how the court's decision might affect the obstruction case by Special Counsel Jack Smith against Trump in Washington. But the high court is expected to release a separate decision Monday regarding presidential immunity, and that ruling will directly impact Smith's case.

Some are even calling for Biden to be replaced as the nominee.



Voters were also concerned by what they saw from the president as he struggled and stumbled throughout the evening.



Within the opening minutes, he flubbed a line saying, ""What I've been able to do with the Covid, excuse me, with, dealing with everything we have to do with, look, if we finally beat Medicare.""

Cognitive Concerns



It became clear to the former President's surrogates, that Biden was in trouble.

Rep. Elise Stefanik (R-NY) said, ""The Biden campaign said this would be the reset moment for Joe Biden's candidacy and what they saw, what the American people saw, was a weak, horrible president, who is the weakest president in our nation's history.""



Voter concerns about Biden's age and mental sharpness were on display during the 90-minute debate as the president struggled at times to answer questions.



Sen. Marco Rubio (R-FL) said, ""He repeated things that were not true and he also said things that, to be frank, there were times that I could not understand what he was saying.""



The showdown had Biden and Trump, the two oldest candidates to ever seek the White House, trading barbs on a number of topics.



On the Economy



""The only jobs he created are for illegal immigrants and bounce back jobs that bounce back from the Covid. He has not done a good job, he's done a poor job, and inflation is killing our country,"" Trump said.



On Abortion



""We are not for late-term abortion. Period. Period, period,"" Biden said.

Trump replied, ""Under Roe v Wade, you have late-term abortion. You can do whatever you want. Depending on the state, you can do whatever you want. We don't think that's a good thing. We think it's a radical thing. We think the Democrats are the radicals.""



On Immigration



Biden said, ""When he was president, he was taking separating babies from their mothers, put him in cages, making sure that the families were separated. That's not the way to go.""



Trump pushed back accusing Biden of putting in place weak border policies that make America unsafe.

""We have the largest number of terrorists coming into our country right now. All terrorists all over the world, not just in South America, all over the world. They come from the Middle East, everywhere, all over the world. That pouring in. And this guy just left it open.""

Biden's Poor Performance



The two also tackled wars in Ukraine and Gaza.



But by the end of the night, everyone was talking about President Biden's poor performance.

Michigan resident Rosanne Ponkowski said, ""I have dealt with people that have dementia before, and it's very obvious just from the look on his face, not understanding what's going on, the surprised and shocked look sometimes, the eyes, the very stiff face, the very stiff hands, they're all very prominent signs of what's going on.""

The White House tried to put a brave face on the evening telling reporters that Biden had a cold.



Surrogates like California Governor Gavin Newsom (D) attempted to side-step voter concerns that the president is too old.



CBN News directly asked Gov. Newsom, ""There's a lot of concern about the president's stamina and mental health. Are you concerned, 81 years old, are concerned about that going forward?"" Newsom replied, ""I'm worried about President Trump's stamina."" We followed up with, ""No, I'm talking about the president."" Newsom replied, ""No, I'm talking about President Trump as well.""



One top Biden donor reportedly called the president's performance disqualifying, telling Reuters that he expects Democrats will urge him to step aside ahead of the party's national convention in August.

Still, in a post-debate rally, Biden told supporters that he was confident he could win against Trump. ""Look, we're going to beat this guy. We need to beat this guy. And I need you in order to beat him. You're the people I've run for,"" Biden said.



Coming into the debate, Biden and Trump found themselves nearly tied in some national opinion polls. We'll see in the coming days whether this debate did anything to significantly change those dynamics. For now, though, the race is set to be decided here in Georgia and a handful of other key swing states like Wisconsin, Michigan, and Arizona. Meanwhile, voters there and across the country will get another look at the candidates on September 10th.","ATLANTA – Democrats are panicking over President Biden's shaky performance in last night's historic debate with former President Trump.

Coming into the debate, Biden and Trump found themselves nearly tied in some national opinion polls.","['going', 'beat', 'bidens', 'president', 'trump', 'biden', 'world', 'debate', 'newsom', 'reportedly', 'look', 'shaky', 'performance', 'democrats', 'panicking']",https://www2.cbn.com/sites/default/files/media/slider/images/ap24180101116281.jpg,True,atlanta - democrat panick presid biden shaki perform last night histor debat former presid trump even call biden replac nomine voter also concern saw presid struggl stumbl throughout even within open minut flub line say what ive abl covid excus me with deal everyth with look final beat medicar cognit concern becam clear former presid surrog biden troubl rep elis stefanik rni said the biden campaign said would reset moment joe biden candidaci saw american peopl saw weak horribl presid weakest presid nation histori voter concern biden age mental sharp display minut debat presid struggl time answer question sen marco rubio rfl said he repeat thing true also said thing that frank time could understand say showdown biden trump two oldest candid ever seek white hous trade barb number topic economi the job creat illeg immigr bounc back job bounc back covid done good job hes done poor job inflat kill countri trump said abort we lateterm abort period period period biden said trump repli under roe v wade lateterm abort whatev want depend state whatev want think that good thing think radic thing think democrat radic immigr biden said when presid take separ babi mother put cage make sure famili separ that way go trump push back accus biden put place weak border polici make america unsaf read isi network help cross us border illeg mani miss we largest number terrorist come countri right now terrorist world south america world come middl east everywher world pour in guy left open biden poor perform two also tackl war ukrain gaza end night everyon talk presid biden poor perform michigan resid rosann ponkowski said i dealt peopl dementia befor obvious look face understand what go on surpris shock look sometim eye stiff face stiff hand theyr promin sign what go on white hous tri put brave face even tell report biden cold surrog like california governor gavin newsom d attempt sidestep voter concern presid old news direct ask gov newsom there lot concern presid stamina mental health concern year old concern go forward newsom repli im worri presid trump stamina follow with no im talk presid newsom repli no im talk presid trump well one top biden donor report call presid perform disqualifi tell reuter expect democrat urg step asid ahead parti nation convent august pleas sign newslett download news app ensur keep receiv latest news still postdeb ralli biden told support confid could win trump look were go beat guy need beat guy need order beat him peopl ive run for biden said come debat biden trump found near tie nation opinion poll well see come day whether debat anyth signific chang dynam now though race set decid georgia hand key swing state like wisconsin michigan arizona meanwhil voter across countri get anoth look candid septemb th

(AP Photo/Alex Brandon)

In one of the most eagerly anticipated opinions of this term, the U.S. Supreme Court has essentially decided to kick the can down the road on Idaho's abortion law.

The official release of the ruling comes a day after the decision was prematurely leaked by someone at the Supreme Court. It was published online briefly on Wednesday before being removed. A court spokeswoman said the post was a mistake.

The decision will allow emergency abortions for now in a procedural ruling that leaves key questions unanswered. For now, the Idaho case will continue to play out in lower courts, and could end up before the Supreme Court again.

Liberty Counsel Founder and Chairman Mat Staver explained, ""This order means that the case returns to the Ninth Circuit, which had ordered that the appeal of the preliminary injunction be decided by the full court on an expedited basis without any further briefing. The abortion ban currently remains in place in Idaho, except for those in emergency room situations.""

WATCH Our Analysis: Supreme Court Rules on Idaho Abortion Ban

What the Case Is Really About

The Biden administration had sued Idaho claiming the state's law violates a federal law called the Emergency Medical Treatment and Labor Act (EMTALA). The White House insists the EMTALA requires hospital emergency rooms to provide abortions to women if their general health is at risk. Idaho's law already provided an exception to save the life of the mother, so the case is seen as an effort to expand abortion access beyond that.

Idaho Solicitor General Joshua Turner suggested the Biden administration's ""health"" definition is too broad because it could be interpreted to include many non-life-threatening health concerns, including mental health.

And the Alliance Defending Freedom accused the Biden administration of trying to invent ""a federal abortion mandate by manipulating EMTALA.""

During the arguments at the court, Justice Samuel Alito said the EMTALA was not intended to include abortion because it specifically identifies unborn children as patients who should be cared for in emergency rooms.

""One potentially very important phrase in EMTALA,"" he said, ""is the reference to the woman's unborn child. Isn't that an odd phrase to put in a statute that imposes a mandate to perform abortions? Have you ever seen an abortion statute that uses the phrase, 'unborn child?'""

Alito pointed out, ""So in that situation, the hospital must stabilize the threat to the unborn child. And it seems like the plain meaning is that the hospital must try to eliminate any immediate threat to the child. Performing an abortion is antithetical to that duty.""

Abortion Leaks at the Supreme Court

Two years ago, Politico obtained a draft of the Dobbs ruling that overturned Roe v. Wade, stoking widespread outrage by pro-choice activists before the ruling was officially meant to be revealed. It fueled extremists who began firebombing and vandalizing pro-life pregnancy clinics and issuing death threats to the workers who try to help women facing unexpected pregnancies.

The Supreme Court never discovered who infamously leaked that Dobbs ruling, and now there is speculation about why this Idaho abortion ruling was also leaked.



Pro-life activist Kristan Hawkins posted on X, ""With media reporting on what appears to be a disappointing outcome in the EMTALA case, you have to wonder whether it's time for some people working on our nation's highest court need to be invited to find new jobs. Did the person who leaked the Dobbs decision 'accidentally' post today? Inquiring minds want to know.""","An pro-life protestor is seen on the ground after being pushed during a protest by abortion activists at the Supreme Court, June 24, 2024.

Now there's been a major revelation about how the Biden administration has pushed the transgender agenda when it comes to children.

According to the New York Times, Biden officials played a significant role in convincing an international pro-transgender medical group to remove age limits from its guidelines for trans surgeries.

""Email excerpts from members of the World Professional Association for Transgender Health (WPATH) recount how staff for Adm. Rachel Levine, assistant secretary for health at the Department of Health and Human Services and herself a transgender woman, urged them to drop the proposed limits from the group's guidelines and apparently succeeded,"" The Times reports.

The administration was reportedly concerned that age minimums would trigger political backlash that could fuel legislation opposing the trans ideology.

More than two dozen states now have laws restricting gender-altering medical experiments on the bodies of minors. And this week, the Supreme Court agreed to hear the Biden administration's challenge to one of those laws.

LATEST Supreme Court Takes up Hot Topic of Gender-Altering Procedures on Children

Critics say children are too young to make these irreversible, life-altering decisions while supporters claim that young people with gender dysphoria need the procedures right away.

But as CBN News reported earlier this year, U.S.-based think tank Environmental Progress reported that even the WPATH admitted behind closed doors that ""children and adolescents cannot comprehend the lifelong consequences of 'gender-affirming care,' and in some cases, due to poor health literacy, neither can their parents.""

MORE Leaked Files Reveal Major Risks with Transgender Experiments: 'It Is Not Medicine'

When we confronted WPATH about those claims, Marci Bowers, M.D., president of the group, told us in a statement, ""The world is not flat. Gender, like genitalia, is represented by diversity. The small percentage of the population that is trans or gender diverse deserves healthcare and will never be a threat to the global gender binary.""

Meanwhile, England and other European nations are backing away from transition procedures on minors after studies showed ""weak evidence"" that they lead to long-term positive impacts.

""This is one instance in which I think Europe is headed in the right direction,"" Sarah Parshall Perry of the Heritage Foundation told CBN's Wendy Griffith. ""In addition to that, we are now seeing Norway, Finland, Sweden, and now the most recent edition is Scotland who has backed off the use of chemical castration agents as well.""

There is also a growing number of people who regret undergoing gender transition and are seeking to revert back to their biological gender. They're warning distressed children and their families about rushing into life-altering medical decisions.

This debate is also the earliest in modern history, well ahead of the traditional fall schedule.

New rules aim to prevent chaotic scenes from past debates. There will be no live audience, no opening statements, and both candidates' microphones will be muted unless it's their turn to speak.

Performance on the debate stage might be the most crucial aspect for the 81-year-old Biden as Republicans highlight his age and mental health.

""Which Joe Biden's going to show up?"" asked House Speaker Mike Johnson. ""My summary is this: It doesn't matter if he drinks a whole gallon of energy drinks, he's not going to be able to match the acumen and the readiness of Donald Trump.""

Nathan Gonzales from Inside Elections tells CBN News that because some Republicans have portrayed Biden as too old and incompetent, the real challenge may lie with Donald Trump. ""Trump is used to feeding off the crowd and energy in the room, and that's just not going to be there,"" Gonzales explained. ""Trump is going to have to be disciplined when it comes to time and whether the mic is on or off. He must avoid being perceived as a bully.""

Biden is expected to focus on Trump's 34 felony convictions—a first for a presidential candidate—and other pending criminal cases. He will also likely address the abortion issue after the Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade, thanks to three Trump appointees. Trump, on the other hand, is expected to highlight issues such as the flood of unchecked migrants on the U.S. southern border and high inflation.

President Biden has been preparing for the debate at Camp David over the past several days. Former President Trump has been on the campaign trail, and Wednesday night, he attended a prayer conference call with members of a faith advisory board.

That news comes as top Israeli leaders visited the border with Lebanon where war could break out any day.

Aides to the prime minister have reportedly told the White House that when Netanyahu addresses a joint session of Congress in July, he'll present a new take on achieving a pathway to a Palestinian state. That would be a huge shift.

Yet those reports may be wrong. The Prime Minister's Office told The Times of Israel that Netanyahu ""opposes a Palestinian state and will not change his position in his address to Congress.""

The prime minister has consistently opposed Palestinian statehood in recent years, as poll after poll shows a huge majority of West Bank Palestinians themselves don't want a state next to Israel. They just want Israel destroyed.

Itamar Marcus, director of Palestinian Media Watch, points out most Palestinians hail the murderous attacks on Israelis, including what happened on October 7th.

""There's tremendous support within the West Bank for what happened on October 7th,"" Marcus stated. ""There was a poll taken a month and a half after October 7th – and everyone knew what happened, everybody knew about the rape and the destruction and the massacres – and Palestinians were asked 'With everything that's happened up till now, does it make you proud as a Palestinian?' And 98 percent of Palestinians said it made them proud.""

Preparing for War with Hezbollah & US Weapons Delays

On another front, both Netanyahu and Israeli President Isaac Herzog toured Israel's northern border with Lebanon this week. That's where all-out war may soon come, as the Jewish nation seeks to end daily attacks from Hezbollah on Israeli communities along the border.

In Washington, Israel's Defense Minister Yoav Gallant has supposedly made progress in speeding up shipments of weapons to the U.S. from Israel.

Netanyahu has accused the Biden administration of deliberately slow-walking such shipments.

For the first time, the U.S. administration is admitting there have been bottlenecks in getting some of those weapons shipped.

Gallant addressed Americans, saying Israel needs the U.S. by its side. ""The powerful and enduring bond between the United States and Israel is key to our nation's strategy and our security,"" the defense minister said.

Pennsylvania Sen. John Fetterman has been one Democrat particularly strong in supporting Israel's war with Hamas as others have wavered. He's met with Netanyahu on his first visit here. ""We stand with Israel through this and I'm so sorry for what's been done to this nation,"" Fetterman declared.

Turkey's President Recep Tayyip Erdogan pledged that his nation will stand with Hezbollah if it comes to war. He's condemning Western nations for backing Netanyahu, whose mental fitness he questioned. Erdogan asserted, ""It is extremely bad and pathetic that governments that talk about freedom, human rights, and justice are captives of a mentally ill person like Netanyahu.""

Antisemitism in NYC

In New York City, a masked man who demanded Jews get off a subway car earlier this month faces criminal charges of attempted coercion. He had yelled, ""Raise your hands if you're a Zionist – this is your chance to get out!""

Earlier this week, several dozen people protested against Manhattan District Attorney Alvin Bragg for his refusal to prosecute most of the anti-Israel demonstrators who illegally occupied Columbia University's Hamilton Hall this spring.

One protester said of Bragg, ""He's either a coward or an antisemite.""

The Department of Homeland Security is searching for hundreds of ISIS-related ""subjects of concern"" who crossed the southern U.S. border illegally.

The DHS says more than 400 migrants came into the U.S. from Central Asia through a smuggling network affiliated with the Islamic terrorist group referred to as ISIS. Only about 150 have been arrested while others are reportedly being tracked across 17 states.

However, the whereabouts of more than 50 of those suspects are unknown.

Most of the ISIS-connected individuals who crossed the border were allowed to stay because they were not on a terrorism watch list, according to NBC News.

Brooke Goldstein, executive director of the Lawfare Project, posted an unsettling video of the violence, saying, ""THIS was the scene outside a synagogue and Jewish school in Los Angeles where a pro-Hamas mob gathered and then assaulted Jewish worshippers outside, and blocked entry or exit for others...""

Fortune,https://fortune.com/2024/06/28/joe-biden-replacements-gretchen-whitmer-gavin-newsom-democrats-presidential-debate-disaster/,2024-06-28,22:28:50 UTC,Democrats close ranks around Joe Biden after disastrous debate,"President Joe Biden worked forcefully Friday to quell Democratic anxieties over his unsteady showing in his debate with former President Donald Trump, as elected members of his party closed ranks around him in an effort to shut down talk of replacing him atop the ticket.

Biden’s halting delivery and meandering comments, particularly early in the debate, fueled concerns from even members of his own party that at age 81 he’s not up for the task of leading the country for another four years. It created a crisis moment for Biden’s campaign and his presidency, as members of his party flirted with potential replacements, and donors and supporters couldn’t contain their concern about his showing against Trump.

Biden appeared to acknowledge the criticism during a rally in Raleigh, North Carolina, saying ”I don’t debate as well as I used to.” But he added, “I know how to do this job. I know how to get things done.” Speaking for 18 minutes, Biden appeared far more animated than he had the night before as he excoriated Trump for his “lies” and for waging a campaign aimed at “revenge and retribution.”

“The choice in this election is simple,” Biden said. “Donald Trump will destroy our democracy. I will defend it.”

He added, alluding to his candidacy, “When you get knocked down, you get back up.”

Even before the debate, Biden’s age had been a liability with voters, and Thursday night’s faceoff appeared to reinforce the public’s deep-seated concerns before perhaps the largest audience he will garner in the four months until Election Day.

Privately, his campaign worked to tamp down concerns and keep donors and surrogates on board. Democratic lawmakers on Friday acknowledged Biden’s poor showing, but tried to stop talk of replacing him as their standard-bearer, and instead shift the focus to Trump’s attacks and falsehoods.

“Well, the president didn’t have a good night, but neither did Donald Trump with lie after lie and his dark vision for America,” North Carolina Gov. Roy Cooper told The Associated Press on Friday, hours before he introduced the president in Raleigh. “We cannot send Donald Trump back to the White House. He’s an existential threat to our nation.”

Former President Barack Obama backed up his former vice president, posting on X that “Bad debate nights happen.” Alluding to his own poor showing in the first debate of his reelection campaign in 2012, Obama continued, “Trust me, I know. But this election is still a choice between someone who has fought for ordinary folks his entire life and someone who only cares about himself.”

He added: “Last night didn’t change that, and it’s why so much is at stake in November.”

House Democratic leader Hakeem Jeffries answered with a flat “no” when asked Friday if Biden should step aside.

Rep. Ritchie Torres, D-N.Y., allowed he “had to take a few more antidepressants than usual” after Biden’s debate showing.

But he added that “a Donald Trump presidency would cause me far greater discomfort than a Joe Biden debate performance.”

Biden’s campaign billed the Raleigh event as the largest-yet rally of his reelection bid in the state Trump carried by the narrowest margin in 2020. He then traveled to New York for a weekend of big-dollar fundraisers that his campaign now needs more than ever.

Biden’s campaign announced that it raised $14 million on debate day and the morning after, while Trump’s campaign said it raised more than $8 million from the start of the debate through the end of the night.

Vice President Kamala Harris, whom the Biden campaign sent out to defend his performance, tried to reassure Biden supporters at a rally in Las Vegas on Friday, saying, “This race will not be decided by one night in June.

“This race will be decided by you. By us,” she said. “Who sits in the White House next year will be determined by what we together do in these next 130 days.”

Biden campaign communications director Michael Tyler said there had been no internal conversations “whatsoever” about Biden stepping aside, though he, too, acknowledged that the president had a “bad night” on stage.

Rep. Emanuel Cleaver, D-Mo., said he could hardly sleep because of the number of telephone calls he got after Biden performed “horribly” in the debate.

“People were just concerned. And I told everybody being concerned is healthy, overreacting is dangerous,” Cleaver said.

Rep. James Clyburn, a South Carolina Democrat whose support in that state helped Biden secure the Democratic nomination four years ago, said he would likely speak to Biden later Friday and his message would be simple: “Stay the course.”

Biden and his team have long wagered that voters would look past their concerns about his age and unpopularity when confronted at the ballot box with a choice between the president and Trump. Despite their concerns about Biden’s performance, they took solace in Trump doing little to expand his own appeal to voters on Thursday.

Polls from CNN and 538/Ipsos conducted soon after the debate found that most debate-watchers thought Trump outperformed Biden. But the two men’s favorability ratings remained largely unchanged, just as they did in the aftermath of Trump’s conviction.

Democrats seized on Trump’s equivocations on whether he would accept the will of voters this time around, his refusal to condemn the rioters who stormed the Capitol on Jan. 6, 2021, trying to overturn his 2020 loss to Biden, and his embrace of the conservative-leaning Supreme Court’s overturning of Roe v. Wade that had legalized abortion nationwide.

But Biden fumbled on abortion rights, one of the most important issues for Democrats in this year’s election. He was unable to explain Roe v. Wade, the landmark Supreme Court ruling that legalized abortion nationwide. A conservative Supreme Court with three justices nominated by Trump overturned Roe two years ago.

As elected Democrats united behind Biden publicly, donors and party operatives shared panicked text messages and phone calls Thursday night and into Friday expressing their concern that Biden’s performance was so bad that he may be unelectable this fall.

Among the few public Democratic voices calling on Biden to step aside was congressional candidate Nancy Boyda in Kansas, who broke with most in her party and called on Biden to suspend his campaign and retire at the end of his current term.

But there were no immediate signs of organized efforts among donors, his campaign leadership or the Democratic National Committee to convince the president to step aside, according to interviews with several people who spoke on the condition of anonymity to share sensitive conversations.

Michigan Gov. Gretchen Whitmer, a Democrat frequently mentioned as a 2028 contender and speculated about as a potential replacement for Biden, released a statement backing him on Friday.

“The difference between Joe Biden’s vision for making sure everyone in America has a fair shot and Donald Trump’s dangerous, self-serving plans will only get sharper as we head toward November,” she said.

California Gov. Gavin Newsom also dismissed questions on whether he would consider stepping in for Biden, telling reporters, “I will never turn my back on him.”

Under current Democratic Party rules, it would be difficult, if not impossible, to replace Biden as the party’s nominee without his cooperation or without party officials being willing to rewrite the rules at the August national convention.

Trump was set to hold a rally Friday afternoon in Chesapeake, Virginia, a onetime battleground that has shifted toward Democrats in recent years but that his aides believe can flip toward the Republican in November.","“Donald Trump will destroy our democracy.

Fortune,https://fortune.com/2024/06/28/donald-trump-immigrants-black-jobs-jobless-rate-employment-labor-shortage/,2024-06-28,21:18:59 UTC,Donald Trump says immigration is taking 'Black jobs.' Top economists: No,"Last night, former President Donald Trump made a comment about “Black jobs” that drew ire, mockery, and laughter from Black Americans on social media.

During Thursday’s presidential debate, Trump said that President Joe Biden’s “big kill” on Black people was allowing an influx of immigrants through the border.

“They’re taking Black jobs now—and it could be 18, it could be 19 and even 20 million people,” Trump said. “They’re taking Black jobs, and they’re taking Hispanic jobs, and you haven’t seen it yet, but you’re gonna see something that’s going to be the worst in our history.”

Michelle Holder, a renowned labor economist who studies racial inequities, said she was dismayed and confused by the term.

“It was insulting to me, as a Black labor economist, to hear the term ‘black jobs,’” she told Fortune. She added that the comment, which was supposed to appeal to Black voters, likely “backfired.”

Black workers have fared well under both the Trump and Biden administrations. The Black unemployment rate remains at historic lows. In September 2019, under Trump, the unemployment rate for the group fell to 5.3%, a record low at the time. Under Biden, it dropped even further to a new low of 4.8% in April 2023.

Today, Black unemployment has risen slightly, to 6.1%, ticking up along with the national rate, which is at 4%.

Meanwhile, the share of Black Americans with jobs—at 59.1%—is still near a peak of 60.4% set last year.

Despite the progress, the quote echos a long-held argument: An influx of immigration takes jobs away from native-born workers, or, at the very least, depresses their wages. Fortune asked Lant Pritchett, a leading immigration economist who teaches at Harvard’s Kennedy School and researches at University of Oxford, about this. He said that among economists, the question is “pretty settled.”

Immigration does not take away native jobs

There is “almost no evidence” of an influx of immigration displacing disadvantaged workers, Pritchett said. He pointed to the study UC Berkeley economist David Card won a Nobel Prize for, which analyzed the impact of the 1980 Mariel Boatlift that brought hundreds of thousands of Cubans to Miami in a manner of months. Card found “no effect on the wages or unemployment rates of less-skilled workers.” If anything, wages rose relative to their previous trend in Miami.

The result was so surprising that economists analyzed the study again and again, attempting to understand how the real-life result defied economic principles. Card replicated the study with different cities, and another time with different types of immigrants, and found the same conclusion. Other economists found the same results in their own studies.

“The main thing that’s gone on in this immigration literature in the last few years is that we’ve kind of concluded that there’s a relatively small effect of it for competing natives,” Card said in a previous interview.

Then, in 2017, Harvard economist George Borjas replicated the study with a smaller definition of “low-skilled” workers and found their wages collapsed. The result drew attention from the Atlantic, National Review, and New Yorker, among others, and was heralded by Republicans.

The study also found that Black workers’ wages fell, but Card cast doubt on the findings.

“​​I have followed this closely, but my sense is that other people who have looked into this in detail are not convinced,” he told Fortune in a message on Friday.

Pritchett is one of them. He referred to an analysis done by another economist, Michael Clemens, who found that Borjas’s study relied on only 17 individuals, much too small of a sample size to be relied on. He said that the hype around Borjas’s work came from those with an anti-immigrant bias who were willing to cherry-pick data to prove it.

“If you started from the question, what are things that are disadvantaging African Americans in economic progress, and you came to the conclusion that immigration was one of the big factors, I would listen to you,” Pritchett said. “But if you start from a position, I’m against immigration and have been in all ways, and then come to the conclusion that it negatively affects African Americans, I’m pretty skeptical.”

The need for more workers

Pritchett’s research suggests that America will soon desperately need millions of workers to cover a “historically unprecedented” gap in the labor force.

America—like most wealthy countries—has an aging population and could soon be faced with fewer workers. Over the decade of 2020 to 2030, the U.S. working-aged population will fall by 4.5 million people without immigration, according to a United Nations report. Meanwhile, the Bureau of Labor Statistics forecasts that between 2021 and 2031, there will be 3.2 million net new jobs in entry-level positions.

“That math cannot be made to add up,” Pritchett said with a chuckle. “You can’t fill 3 million new jobs with negative 4 million people.”

The policy challenge used to be to find a job for every worker. Now, the U.S. will struggle to find a worker for every job, Pritchett said.

Some experts have already suggested that immigrants are “saving” the U.S. from a taut labor market. Between January 2020 and July 2023, the immigrant labor force grew by 9.5%, dwarfing the 1.5% growth rate among native-born workers.

What are the economic issues that do concern Black americans?

The most concerning issues for Black Americans, Holder said, are wages, inflation, and unemployment.

Black unemployment reached a historic low last year, she said. Can we sustain these current economic conditions? And, how are those jobs paying Black Americans?

Rather than using immigration to stoke fear, she wants Trump to answer those questions.

“That’s what I think Black voters want to hear about,” Holder said. “I just don’t think we are really wrapped up in trying to blame migrants for any problems facing the Black community at this point.”","Last night, former President Donald Trump made a comment about “Black jobs” that drew ire, mockery, and laughter from Black Americans on social media.
“They’re taking Black jobs now—and it could be 18, it could be 19 and even 20 million people,” Trump said.

Unless the polls are wildly inaccurate, the Conservative party is heading towards a catastrophic defeat in the coming election.

All across the rich world, voters are angry at their governments – they blame politicians for a burst of inflation that happened almost everywhere and is now subsiding almost everywhere, including in the UK. But the Conservatives deserve defeat more than most: they took power 14 years ago promising to deliver responsible policies and economic success. Instead they have presided over economic stagnation and a collapse in public services.

Why has Conservative governance gone so badly? It is natural to blame Brexit, which did indeed increase trade frictions and therefore surely had a negative effect on British real income. However, Brexit has not had the disastrous effects some predicted, and has somewhat perversely led to a rise rather than a fall in immigration, especially of the highly skilled.

In fact, the roots of Britain’s poor economic performance are older and deeper than Brexit. Though many bad decisions undoubtedly contributed, one central cause was the way David Cameron and George Osborne gratuitously embraced fiscal austerity when they came to power after the global financial crisis.

At the time, this looked like an obvious macroeconomic error; more than a decade later, it has become a social and political catastrophe.

Let us recall the circumstances when the Conservatives took power. The financial crisis had produced a severe global recession; by 2010 the world economy was growing again, but all major economies, Britain included, were still operating far below capacity and had high unemployment.

Textbook economics tells us that when unemployment is high and inflation is low, governments should try to stimulate demand with reduced interest rates and fiscal deficits. Interest cuts were not an option because rates were already close to zero, so the indicated policy was fiscal stimulus.

Yet the Cameron government chose to do the opposite, pulling back fiscal support from an economy that still needed it badly. Britain was not the only nation turning to fiscal austerity in the face of high unemployment – Greece engaged in savage austerity, while Portugal, Spain, Italy and Ireland made large cuts, and fiscal policy in the US also turned contractionary.

What made the British case unique was that it was almost entirely an unforced error. Southern European austerity was a response to pressure from the bond markets: Greece was in effect cut off from private markets, while other nations faced sharply increased borrowing costs, becoming dependent on official lenders who insisted on budget cuts as a condition for loans. Bond buyers never lost faith in the US, but after 2010 Barack Obama faced a deeply hostile Congress, which in effect blackmailed him into spending cuts by threatening to provoke a government default.

While Britain had low borrowing costs like the US, its government was not divided. The Cameron executive could have chosen to maintain spending. Why did it turn to austerity?

Part of the answer is that policymakers were genuinely spooked by the sudden emergence of the crisis in Greece. Until Greece hit the wall, debt crises were generally thought of as a problem that happened only in poorer nations. It is understandable that many observers, at least initially, wondered if the Greek crisis was the leading edge of a broader attack by bond vigilantes.

But UK debt was clearly far smaller relative to the economy than Greece’s – and it became obvious early on that contagion from the Greek debt crisis was restricted to eurozone nations. So there was no reason to continue believing that the UK risked “becoming Greece”, as many politicians recklessly claimed at the time.

In fact, it soon became clear that even the eurozone crisis was more a matter of market panic than one of fundamentally unsustainable levels of debt. As the economist Paul De Grauwe has said, nations with debts in another country’s currency can suffer something similar to a bank run: panicked investors seeking to pull out their funds can cause a government to run out of cash, forcing it into default. Nations that borrow in their own currency are not vulnerable to such a self-fulfilling crisis, because they can in effect print money in a crunch.

This analysis was validated in 2012 when Mario Draghi, the president of the European Central Bank (ECB), said three words: “Whatever it takes.” This was taken to mean that the ECB would, if necessary, supply cash to governments facing a market panic. And suddenly the euro “debt” crisis faded away, with investors demanding much lower interest rates on the debt of Italy, Spain and so on.

Since Britain has not adopted the euro and had debts in its own currency, it was not vulnerable to this kind of cash crisis.

The bottom line is that there was no pressing economic need to slash spending in the face of high unemployment. I would argue that the best way to explain Britain’s austerity is not economic but sociological.

Sociology? I used to talk about the push for austerity being led by Very Serious People (a term I borrowed from the blogger Duncan Black). This was not really a joke: if you spend any time consorting with members of the global policy elite, you realise that many of them are driven primarily by the desire to appear “serious”. In economic terms, this usually means pushing policies that will cause significant hardship – to other people, of course.

The obsession with perceived seriousness reflects peer pressure, but in some ways also reflects personal careerism. Officials in democratic nations cannot expect to remain in office for more than a few years. What do they do next? If they have lobbied for “serious” policies, they can have a bright future giving speeches at Davos about the importance of making “tough choices”. Or they might even end up employed by the financial industry to lobby their former colleagues – where a reputation for “seriousness” is a prerequisite, no matter how much damage those policies have caused. (Indeed, Osborne has done both.)

Sociology partly explains the Conservative embrace of austerity. But there was also political calculation. Denunciations of debt and deficits often go hand in hand with demands for smaller government, in particular a shrunken welfare state. In effect, politicians whose real goal is to move policy to the right exploit fear of deficits to push an agenda that would be deeply unpopular if stated openly. The Oxford economist Simon Wren-Lewis calls this the “deficit deceit” hypothesis. The deceit aspect is especially obvious in the US, where Republican leaders routinely denounce deficits while pushing for budget-busting tax cuts. But there is every reason to believe that the same kind of cynicism played an important role in UK austerity.

It turns out, however, that exploiting debt fears to engineer cuts in public spending tends not to work out quite the way that small-government advocates hope.

What serious conservatives – they do exist – want is a less generous social safety net, with fewer income transfers to households, while governments concentrate on those functions that only government can perform. I do not share that desire, but never mind. What is important is that voters do not share that desire: cutting direct financial aid is deeply unpopular.

What does this have to do with deficit deceit? Even when a government manages to build support for spending cuts by scaring the public about debt and deficits, it generally finds itself shying away from spending cuts that will directly affect families’ incomes. Instead, it tries to save money by shortchanging public investment and public services, a strategy that seems preferable because the consequences of these spending cuts may not be all that visible in the short run.

But the effects of inadequate public investment cumulate over time, so that a fiscal strategy advertised as an exercise in responsibility ends up being deeply irresponsible, leading to crumbling infrastructure and deteriorating public services. This is how Cameron and Osborne’s error has compounded over the past decade.

Consider the NHS. I am clearly not an expert on the system, and I am sure that the NHS’s problems have multiple causes. But it is obvious to an outsider that direct public provision of healthcare, while it has major advantages, creates a special form of political vulnerability.

Compare the NHS with single-payer systems – including Medicare, which serves older Americans – in which the government pays the bills but does not employ the doctors or operate the hospitals. An attempt to save money by underfunding Medicare would provoke an immediate public outcry – in fact, false rumours of such a move created an outcry in 2010. But a government can underfund the NHS for years before the consequences become obvious to voters, and by that time the crisis can be very hard to fix.

To sum up: a decade ago, the main critique of austerity was macroeconomic – it was holding back recovery from the severe recession that followed the global financial crisis. And it did. But that was not the end of the story. Austerity also gradually undermined public services, including healthcare.

What will a Labour government do to reverse this damage? There are two reasons to worry it will fall short.

First, the era of Conservative austerity coincided with an era of low interest rates and substantial excess capacity, exactly the conditions under which Britain should have been investing in its future. The current environment is much less favourable.

Second, Labour’s stated plans lack any ambition to reverse austerity. In the US, the Biden administration came in with bold plans and managed to accomplish a significant fraction of them despite having only a razor-thin congressional majority. I am not hearing anything comparable from Labour, even though Keir Starmer seems on course to have political capital beyond the wildest dreams of US progressives.

I hope to be proved wrong. But right now it looks as though the shadow of austerity policies adopted in error 14 years ago will continue to darken Britain’s prospects for many years to come.","Though many bad decisions undoubtedly contributed, one central cause was the way David Cameron and George Osborne gratuitously embraced fiscal austerity when they came to power after the global financial crisis.
Britain was not the only nation turning to fiscal austerity in the face of high unemployment – Greece engaged in savage austerity, while Portugal, Spain, Italy and Ireland made large cuts, and fiscal policy in the US also turned contractionary.
What made the British case unique was that it was almost entirely an unforced error.
And suddenly the euro “debt” crisis faded away, with investors demanding much lower interest rates on the debt of Italy, Spain and so on.
But right now it looks as though the shadow of austerity policies adopted in error 14 years ago will continue to darken Britain’s prospects for many years to come.","['fiscal', 'error', 'wrecked', 'debt', 'spending', 'economic', 'britain', 'austerity', 'crisis', 'nations', 'unforced', 'public', 'policies', 'cuts']",https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/926fdf4daeea34c2e4f0479cbe92eb3c9593d1b9/0_0_3848_2308/master/3848.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=2686c548c3c1b2f4bcc8f93ce7b61474,True,view imag fullscreen composit guardian design teamgetti unless poll wild inaccur conserv parti head toward catastroph defeat come elect across rich world voter angri govern -

The Guardian,https://www.theguardian.com/business/article/2024/jun/26/it-doesnt-make-sense-why-us-tariffs-on-chinese-cleantech-risk-the-green-transition,2024-06-26,04:00:06 UTC,It doesn’t make sense: why US tariffs on Chinese cleantech risk the green transition | Jeffrey Frankel,"With historic heatwaves sweeping across the US and other parts of the northern hemisphere, June is expected to be the 13th consecutive month of record-breaking global temperatures. The primary cause, of course, is the enormous amount of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere. Despite the existential threat posed by rising atmospheric concentrations of greenhouse gases, emissions continue to increase at a faster pace than previously anticipated.

On one front, however, progress in the fight against the climate crisis has exceeded expectations. Amid the global shift from internal combustion engines to electric vehicles and the accelerated adoption of solar and wind power, demand for renewable energy is rapidly rising in the US and the EU.

This increased demand has been fuelled by significant declines in the real prices of solar panels, wind turbines, batteries, and EVs. In the US, this can be attributed in part to the clean-energy subsidies included in President Joe Biden’s Inflation Reduction Act and, more significantly, to low-cost Chinese imports.

Alarmingly, new tariffs imposed by the US and the EU on imports of solar panels, EVs, and other equipment, threaten to derail this progress. While estimating the cost of the clean energy transition is a difficult task, even conceptually, the global electricity sector alone is projected to require $3.5tn in capital investment annually between 2021 and 2050. Western countries have demanded that China pay its fair share of these costs, but their own trade policies are starkly at odds with their objectives.

Although the disproportionate targeting of cleantech imports from China dates back more than a decade, the trend accelerated significantly under former US president Donald Trump and has continued under Biden. In May, the Biden administration imposed a 100% tariff on Chinese EVs, along with new levies on a range of other Chinese goods, including solar cells and lithium-ion batteries.

These measures aim to protect American workers and critical domestic industries. But they risk undermining the administration’s climate agenda, particularly its efforts to raise the share of renewables to 100% of US electricity by 2035 and the share of EVs to 50% of new car sales by 2030.

The new US tariffs could extend beyond China’s national borders. In response to western tariffs, some Chinese manufacturers have moved to south-east Asia in recent years. Earlier this month, the US International Trade Commission decided to investigate claims by American solar-cell companies seeking to impose countervailing and anti-dumping duties on south-east Asian manufacturers. This decision comes despite opposition from US solar-power developers who rely on imported equipment for domestic production.

Meanwhile, the European Commission has imposed provisional tariffs on Chinese EVs after an eight-month investigation found that China’s “unfair subsidisation” of its EV industry undercuts EU competitors. The new EU tariffs, while not prohibitive, average 31%, which is substantially higher than the duties on conventional car imports from other trading partners.

To be sure, while historically low labour costs and economies of scale have helped reduce the price of Chinese solar panels and EVs, generous government subsidies – often in the form of cheap credit – have also played a significant role. But it remains unclear how blocking these low-cost imports, as many western politicians propose, would benefit workers and consumers in the US and the EU. Do American and European policymakers prefer that their own taxpayers, instead of Chinese citizens, bear the costs of clean-energy subsidies? Recall that western countries wanted China to pay its fair share of the energy transition.

Admittedly, promoting climate policies by emphasising their potential to create green jobs for domestic workers could be an effective political strategy. But we should recognise that these arguments are political, not economic.

Although US tariffs may help create jobs in the solar-panel industry, those would be offset by job losses in the solar-energy installation sector, which relies on low-cost equipment. Similarly, some EV production jobs would disappear if tariffs led to higher prices for battery imports. Meanwhile, many export jobs would be cut when China and other countries inevitably retaliate against western restrictions.

With US unemployment at 4%, policymakers and voters are now more concerned about inflation than jobs. Removing tariffs is the surest way for western governments to lower energy and transportation prices, thereby reducing inflation. This is yet another example of how international trade could lower the costs of the clean-energy transition – if we were to embrace it.

Dividend investing can be quite challenging in the rapidly changing world in which we find ourselves. Many times, dividend investors may focus on dividend kings and aristocrats (NOBL) with the thought that since their business models have been able to support dividend growth every year for 25 to 50 or more years without any interruptions, they are likely to continue doing so for years to come. While this principle generally holds, there are still some glaring exceptions, as evidenced by recent massive failures by various dividend kings and aristocrats such as Leggett & Platt (LEG), 3M (MMM), AT&T (T), Walgreens Boots Alliance (WBA), and even WP Carey (WPC). As a result, simply buying dividend aristocrats and dividend kings blindly is a risky proposition, as you never know when the next shoe will drop from that list. Instead, it may be best to look for businesses that combine attractive fundamentals, dividends, and valuations with major macro tailwinds that can drive them to continued prosperity for years to come.

In this article, we will discuss stocks that are poised to profit from three macro trends that we see being quite prominent in the coming decade, if not longer: artificial intelligence, soaring geopolitical risks and conflicts, and the onset of stagflation for at least the next few years.

#1. Artificial Intelligence Dividend Investments

For the portion of the portfolio that could profit from the artificial intelligence boom while still being income-focused, I think the best plays are Broadcom (AVGO) and the JPMorgan Nasdaq Equity Premium Income ETF (JEPQ). While Broadcom no longer has a high yield due to its strong stock performance in recent years, its 1.4% dividend yield is still on the high end relative to many other major AI stocks. Additionally, the company has a track record of growing its dividend consistently and appears poised to continue doing so for years to come, with analysts expecting it to grow at a near 13% CAGR through 2028, making it a solid dividend growth pick while also leaning into the AI tailwind.

Investors can complement that by holding JEPQ, which has 52% of its portfolio invested in technology stocks, including all of its top ten holdings positioned to profit from artificial intelligence in some way. These include Microsoft (MSFT) and Apple (AAPL), its top two positions, which are also dividend growth stocks. JEPQ implements a notional covered call strategy, enabling it to pay very lucrative monthly dividends equating to an 8.75% trailing 12-month yield. This means that an income investor can significantly boost their portfolio's income generation capabilities while also maintaining significant exposure to leading artificial intelligence plays, including Apple, Microsoft, NVIDIA (NVDA), Tesla (TSLA), Meta (META), and Amazon (AMZN). I also like JEPQ at the moment because I believe the AI space is richly valued, and the covered call strategy implemented by JEPQ takes some of that risk off the table as their strategy exchanges some future upside for cash premiums on the covered calls, which I find attractive given the current market conditions.

#2. Geopolitical Risk Dividend Investments

When it comes to rising geopolitical risks, investing in major defense primes like General Dynamics (GD) and Huntington Ingalls Industries (HII) are good bets because they are the leading shipbuilders for the United States Navy. Given that the leading geopolitical challenge is in the Pacific from China, the U.S., along with its AUKUS allies, will likely invest aggressively in expanding its naval capabilities. In fact the U.S. Navy is already investing aggressively towards this end and the Biden administration recently requested even more funds to do so. If Trump gets elected in the Fall, it is highly likely that he will increase this effort even further as he has made building up the U.S. military and countering China a cornerstone of his foreign policy agenda if he gets re-elected. This should profit GD and HII significantly. While their current dividend yields of about 2% each are not particularly high, their valuations are reasonable, with HII trading at a 14.9 P/E and GD at a 19.1 P/E. Additionally, both companies should be able to post strong earnings per share and dividend growth in the coming years. For example, HII is expected to grow its dividend per share at a 20% CAGR through 2028, and GD is expected to grow its dividend at about a 10% CAGR in the coming years.

Additionally, I think that Newmont Corporation (NEM) is a worthwhile investment because gold will likely shoot higher from rising geopolitical risks and the continued de-dollarization around the world. Central banks are buying gold hand over fist, and Newmont, with its high-grade mines, provides leveraged exposure to the price of gold. Additionally, its concentration in jurisdictions with lower geopolitical risk should help it hold up well, even if global conflicts intensify.

#3. Stagflation Dividend Investments

When it comes to profiting from stagflation, I think buying the Schwab U.S. Dividend Equity ETF (SCHD) is a good approach since most of the holdings in that ETF are fairly defensive in nature and grow their dividends at a strong clip, which should exceed inflation. However, I believe even better plays are infrastructure and real estate businesses that are not only very defensive and highly contracted in nature but also have inflation-linked revenue escalators. My four favorite picks for this type of investment are Brookfield Infrastructure Partners (BIP)(BIPC), Brookfield Renewable Partners (BEP)(BEPC), and Enterprise Products Partners (EPD) (Enbridge (ENB) isn't a bad substitute for those looking to avoid a K1) in the infrastructure and energy spaces. All three have strong balance sheets, well-diversified portfolios of assets that are highly contracted and/or regulated, and significant inflation protections. W.P. Carey (WPC) is also compelling in the real estate space due to its CPI-linked leases and triple-net lease structure, providing significant cash flow visibility and a very long 12.2-year term to maturity on its leases.

Investor Takeaway

Combining these stocks into a $100,000 portfolio, I would allocate 15% to JEPQ and 5% to AVGO, giving the portfolio 20% exposure to the AI trade while still generating sufficient current income and dividend growth. For the geopolitical risk trade, I would allocate 5% to GD, 5% to HII, and 10% to NEM, though it may make sense to allocate 5% to Gold (GLD) and 5% to NEM to further mitigate risks. Finally, for the stagflation trade, I would allocate 10% each to EPD, BIP, BEP, and WPC, and 15% to SCHD. The result would be an attractive overall dividend yield along with strong dividend growth, with high single-digit annualized dividend growth expected for SCHD, BIP, BEP, and GD; double-digit annualized dividend growth expected for AVGO and HII; and mid-single-digit dividend growth expected for WPC and EPD. Overall, this portfolio balances income generation and growth potential while leveraging key macro trends to provide resilience and upside potential in a challenging economic environment.","These include Microsoft (MSFT) and Apple (AAPL), its top two positions, which are also dividend growth stocks.

Overall, this portfolio balances income generation and growth potential while leveraging key macro trends to provide resilience and upside potential in a challenging economic environment.","['hii', 'intelligence', 'growth', 'geopolitical', 'big', 'trends', 'invest', 'macro', 'dividend', 'dividends', 'portfolio', '100000', 'gd', 'stocks', 'jepq', 'strong']",https://static.seekingalpha.com/cdn/s3/uploads/getty_images/1408247283/image_1408247283.jpg?io=getty-c-w1536,True,dni dividend invest quit challeng rapid chang world find ourselv mani time dividend investor may focus dividend king aristocrat nobl thought sinc busi model abl support dividend growth everi year year without interrupt like continu year come principl general hold still glare except evidenc recent massiv failur various dividend king aristocrat leggett platt leg m mmm att t walgreen boot allianc wba even wp carey wpc result simpli buy dividend aristocrat dividend king blind riski proposit never know next shoe drop list instead may best look busi combin attract fundament dividend valuat major macro tailwind drive continu prosper year come articl discuss stock pois profit three macro trend see quit promin come decad longer artifici intellig soar geopolit risk conflict onset stagflat least next year artifici intellig dividend invest portion portfolio could profit artifici intellig boom still incomefocus think best play broadcom avgo jpmorgan nasdaq equiti premium incom etf jepq broadcom longer high yield due strong stock perform recent year dividend yield still high end relat mani major ai stock addit compani track record grow dividend consist appear pois continu year come analyst expect grow near cagr make solid dividend growth pick also lean ai tailwind investor complement hold jepq portfolio invest technolog stock includ top ten hold posit profit artifici intellig way includ microsoft msft appl aapl top two posit also dividend growth stock jepq implement notion cover call strategi enabl pay lucrat month dividend equat trail month yield mean incom investor signific boost portfolio incom generat capabl also maintain signific exposur lead artifici intellig play includ appl microsoft nvidia nvda tesla tsla meta meta amazon amzn also like jepq moment believ ai space rich valu cover call strategi implement jepq take risk tabl strategi exchang futur upsid cash premium cover call find attract given current market condit geopolit risk dividend invest come rise geopolit risk invest major defens prime like general dynam gd huntington ingal industri hii good bet lead shipbuild unit state navi given lead geopolit challeng pacif china us along aukus alli like invest aggress expand naval capabl fact us navi alreadi invest aggress toward end biden administr recent request even fund so trump get elect fall high like increas effort even made build us militari counter china cornerston foreign polici agenda get reelect profit gd hii signific current dividend yield particular high valuat reason hii trade pe gd pe addit compani abl post strong earn per share dividend growth come year exampl hii expect grow dividend per share cagr gd expect grow dividend cagr come year addit think newmont corpor nem worthwhil invest gold like shoot higher rise geopolit risk continu dedollar around world central bank buy gold hand fist newmont highgrad mine provid leverag exposur price gold addit concentr jurisdict lower geopolit risk help hold well even global conflict intensifi stagflat dividend invest come profit stagflat think buy schwab us dividend equiti etf schd good approach sinc hold etf fair defens natur grow dividend strong clip exceed inflat howev believ even better play infrastructur real estat busi defens high contract natur also inflationlink revenu escal four favorit pick type invest brookfield infrastructur partner bipbipc brookfield renew partner bepbepc enterpris product partner epd enbridg enb bad substitut look avoid k infrastructur energi space three strong balanc sheet welldiversifi portfolio asset high contract andor regul signific inflat protect wp carey wpc also compel real estat space due cpilink leas triplenet leas structur provid signific cash flow visibl long year term matur leas investor takeaway combin stock portfolio would alloc jepq avgo give portfolio exposur ai trade still generat suffici current incom dividend growth geopolit risk trade would alloc gd hii nem though may make sens alloc gold gld nem mitig risk final stagflat trade would alloc epd bip bep wpc schd result would attract overal dividend yield along strong dividend growth high singledigit annual dividend growth expect schd bip bep gd doubledigit annual dividend growth expect avgo hii midsingledigit dividend growth expect wpc epd overal portfolio balanc incom generat growth potenti leverag key macro trend provid resili upsid potenti challeng econom environ

The executives at the Business Roundtable, a group representing some of the country’s biggest corporations, objected to Mr. Biden’s proposals to raise taxes. They questioned the lack of business representation in the Cabinet. They bristled at what they called overregulation by federal agencies.

While the meeting was not antagonistic, it was indicative of three and a half years of executive grousing about Mr. Biden. Business leaders have criticized his remarks on “corporate greed” and his appearance on a union picket line. They chafe at the actions of officials he has appointed — particularly the head of the Federal Trade Commission, Lina Khan, who has moved to block a series of corporate mergers.

Trump.

The prime-time bout, organized by CNN and simulcast on more than a dozen networks, was easily the most-viewed moment of the 2024 presidential campaign, the sort of mass civic gathering that is increasingly rare in a choose-your-own-news era of media. And the figure released on Friday by Nielsen, which mostly measures traditional TV sets, did not include the likely millions more who watched on digital news sites and social media platforms.

The size of the TV audience — similar to that for an N.F.L. conference championship game — could be grim news for the Biden campaign, given the shaky and stumbling performance by the president, which set off panic in the upper echelons of the Democratic Party.

But viewership was also down 30 percent from the first Biden-Trump debate in September 2020, which notched more than 73 million viewers. Nielsen said Thursday’s matchup in Atlanta was the lowest-rated general-election debate since the final meeting of George W. Bush and John Kerry in 2004.","The numbers are in: 51.3 million Americans tuned in live to watch Thursday night’s televised debate between President Biden and former President Donald J. Trump.

All eyes will be on CNN at 9 p.m. Eastern, when President Biden and Donald Trump face off in their first debate since 2020. Among the keenest watchers will be executives and investors looking for signs about how the candidates might handle the economy and business in a second term.

There will be plenty to scrutinize in the 90-minute, audience-free debate, including what the candidates say and how they say it. Here’s what we will be looking out for. (And, for a lighter take, check out our debate “bingo card” further below.)

The economy is the big question. Various measures show strong growth under Biden, but many voters feel differently. What will Biden and Trump say about some of the key issues?

Inflation: This is clearly a challenge for the president, as Americans complain about what they’re paying in the grocery store, at the pump and on their rent. Biden can say that price increases are slowing down, and will most likely emphasize his administration’s efforts to crack down on “corporate greed,” like taking on so-called junk fees. Trump will probably stress how good things were when he took office in 2017 — an economy many Americans want back.

Taxes: Biden’s proposals for higher corporate taxes will hit profits: “It’s simple math,” David Bahnsen, the founder and chief investment officer of the Bahnsen Group, told DealBook. Many business leaders don’t like Biden’s plan to increase taxes on the wealthy, either. Trump will probably stress his desire to extend his 2017 tax cuts and lower the corporate rate to 20 percent. But questions about corporate earnings and the economy may eclipse those concerns.

Protectionism: Both candidates want to increase tariffs on Chinese goods, but Biden has been more targeted in how he has done it during his presidency. Trump has proposed significantly higher across-the-board levies, though it’s unclear how serious he is about it. Economists have warned that Trump’s potential approach could aggravate inflation and hurt the economy.

Markets: The S&P 500 set 31 records this year; investors will hope neither party messes with that momentum. In Thursday night’s debate, “markets probably care more about presentation than policy pledges,” Paul Donovan, an economist at UBS, wrote in a client note. Biden may have a slight edge, he added, since investors would prefer keeping “some continuity.”

Other issues will probably feature prominently. Biden will most likely raise abortion rights, a topic that has helped Democrats win in recent elections. Trump will almost certainly speak a lot about immigration, perhaps his most potent issue — and one that many, including Elon Musk, say is a failure of Biden’s.

The intangibles will matter. Executives told DealBook that C.E.O.s will be paying attention to how Biden and Trump perform:

For Biden, 81, an important issue for business leaders and many voters is whether he is still fit to serve. A sharp, forceful performance could go a ways in quieting any concerns.

For Trump, 78, competence is a question as well. But his demeanor will also be under scrutiny, especially if he comes across as overly abrasive or erratic. Some executives said their feelings would come down to whether they can stomach another four years of a Trump presidency.

There’s also the show around the show. Trump has suggested that his potential running mate would be in Atlanta for the debate. The Times reports that his list is narrowing, with Senator J.D. Vance of Ohio, Gov. Doug Burgum of North Dakota and Senator Marco Rubio of Florida being of particular interest.","Talking pointsAll eyes will be on CNN at 9 p.m. Eastern, when President Biden and Donald Trump face off in their first debate since 2020.

Many conservative media outlets have parroted former President Donald J. Trump by questioning the fairness of the debate, which CNN will host, as well as President Biden’s fitness for it. Several publications piled on Mr. Trump’s longstanding criticism that CNN is biased against him.

The preliminary injunctions, which suspend parts of the program known as SAVE, leave millions of borrowers in limbo until lawsuits filed by two groups of Republican-led states challenging the legality of the plan are decided.

That means the Biden administration cannot reduce borrowers’ monthly bills by as much as half starting July 1, as had been scheduled, and it must pause debt forgiveness to SAVE enrollees. The administration has canceled $5.5 billion in debt for more than 414,000 borrowers through the plan, which opened in August.

If you’re among the eight million borrowers making payments through SAVE — the Saving on a Valuable Education plan — you probably have many questions.

Three years ago, corporate leaders openly spoke out against Donald Trump over his role in the Jan. 6, 2021, Capitol attack. But as the former president leads in many polls this time around, most in the C-suite are staying quiet.

In 2021, C.E.O.s including Mary Barra of General Motors and Doug McMillon of Walmart publicly urged a peaceful transition of power. This time, leaders have largely stayed out of the political fray. Only a handful of executives have publicly supported Trump, who was willing to go after perceived enemies in corporate American when he was in office. And while there may be support for President Biden behind the scenes, few have offered it on the record.

What’s behind the silence?

A return to the norm: Executives have mentioned election-related topics 364 times in earning calls in the second quarter as of June 24, according to the data provider AlphaSense. It’s highly unlikely that tally will reach 902, the number of times the topics were mentioned in 2020 during the same period.","Quiet in the C-suiteThree years ago, corporate leaders openly spoke out against Donald Trump over his role in the Jan. 6, 2021, Capitol attack.

For decades, the American toy brand had leaned heavily on factories in China to make its products — wooden puzzles, stuffed animals, play mats. Suddenly, that course looked risky.

It was February 2021, and the world was besieged by a pandemic. Lockdowns disrupted Chinese factories. Trade hostilities between Washington and Beijing were undermining the benefits of depending on plants in China. President Donald J. Trump had slapped tariffs on a broad variety of Chinese imports, increasing their prices, and President Biden extended that policy.

Melissa & Doug was eager to shift some production to other countries. Which explained the arrival of its chief supply chain officer at a factory in Greater Noida, a fast-growing city about 30 miles southeast of the Indian capital, New Delhi.

The factory was owned by a family business called Sunlord. The Melissa & Doug executive was surprised to see that the plant could make high-quality wooden toys, at prices comparable to those in China. Late last year, Sunlord completed its first batch of products for Melissa & Doug, a modest order of about 10,000 items, and now is cranking out 25,000 per month.","Melissa & Doug had a situation.

Most Read from Bloomberg

With former president Donald Trump appearing more likely to unseat Joe Biden in the Nov. 5 election, the market should “be pricing in a considerable risk of higher-than-target inflation in the coming years, and this is from a starting point of our thinking they already offered structural value,” Barclays strategists Michael Pond and Jonathan Hill said in a note.

The simple trade, they wrote, is a wager that five-year Treasury inflation-protected securities, or TIPS, will outperform regular five-year Treasuries, leading to a wider yield spread between the two. That breakeven rate — representing the market-implied expectation for the average inflation rate of the consumer price index over the life of the securities — will widen to 2.5% from about 2.25% currently, Barclays projects.

Trump has proposed steep tariffs on imports, particularly on goods from China, and an aggressive effort to deport those working in the US illegally. He has also pledged to extend across-the-board tax cuts, which would likely worsen the federal deficit and add stimulus to an economy that the Federal Reserve is seeking to restrain.

At 2.25%, the five-year breakeven rate suggests that the market’s expectation for CPI are in line with the Fed’s 2% target, the strategists said. The Fed targets a different inflation gauge — the price index for personal consumption expenditures — which averages 30 basis points to 40 basis points lower than the CPI.

Inflation continues to exceed the Fed’s target rate, but by shrinking margins. Data released Friday showed the PCE price index increased 2.6% in May from a year earlier, down from 2.7% in April. The core PCE price index, which excludes food and energy, also rose 2.6%, the slowest increase since March 2021.

But if the odds in the coming months continue to favor a second Trump term, “we would expect them to be embedded in the market via higher breakevens as the November elections approach,” Pond and Hill wrote.

Shares of the parent company of Trump's social media platform, Truth Social, fell about 12% in late afternoon trading.

Debate experts say Biden's uneasy performance in the debate, which included a raspy voice and moments of confusion, could help Trump win come November. Biden's age of 81 has been a hot-button topic among voters concerned over whether or not he can continue to run the country.

""Biden's bumbling and stumbling performance amplified concerns regarding his capacity to serve and set off a new round of panic in the Democratic Party,"" Isaac Boltansky, BTIG director of policy research, said in reaction to Thursday's debate. ""Trump won the debate and should be viewed as the clear frontrunner this morning, but his demeanor and falsehoods appeared to underscore the concerns some voters have with his fitness for office.""

Shares of DJT have been on a bumpy ride in recent months, oscillating between highs and lows.

In May, Trump was found guilty on all 34 counts of falsifying business records intended to influence the 2016 presidential campaign — a verdict that sent shares down 5% the day following the conviction.

Trump Media, the parent company of Truth Social, went public on the Nasdaq after merging with special purpose acquisition company Digital World Acquisition Corp.

Shares have fallen about 44% since the company's public debut at the end of March.

Trump founded Truth Social after he was kicked off major social media apps like Facebook (META) and Twitter, the platform now known as X, following the Jan. 6 Capitol riots in 2021. Trump has since been reinstated on those platforms, although the former president almost exclusively posted on his Truth Social account throughout the trial.

In April, an updated regulatory filing showed Trump Media reported sales of just over $4 million as net losses reached nearly $60 million for the full year ending Dec. 31. The company warned it expects losses to continue amid greater profitability challenges.

In May, the company reported first quarter results that revealed losses of $327 million, mostly tied to expenses related to its SPAC deal. The company disclosed as of April 29 over 621,000 different shareholders owned stock in Trump Media, noting the ""vast majority"" of these were retail investors.

Story continues

Trump maintains a roughly 60% stake in DJT. At current levels of around $32 a share, Trump Media boasts a market cap of roughly $4.3 billion, giving the former president a stake worth around $2.6 billion. Right after the company's public debut, Trump's stake was worth just over $4.5 billion.

In late April, the stock hit a milestone that secured Trump an additional $1.2 billion in cash. Stakeholders, however, are still subject to a six-month lockup period before selling or transferring shares.

Plug Power Inc (NASDAQ:PLUG) plans to leverage the Inflation Reduction Act’s (IRA) Section 45V Credit for the Production of Clean Hydrogen (PTC) in its upcoming quarterly financial reports.

The development positions Plug Power among the first U.S. clean hydrogen producers to utilize this new incentive. The update sent the stock price higher on Friday.

Also Read: Plug Power +64% After Securing $1.66B Loan Guarantee From Biden Administration

The PTC offers up to $3.00 per kilogram for clean hydrogen produced in the U.S., making hydrogen production more cost-competitive with traditional fossil fuels.

This benefit will significantly lower Plug Power’s fuel costs and help achieve a break-even fuel margin by year-end. Positive fuel margins are expected in 2025 and beyond.

Plug Power’s 15-ton-per-day (TPD) electrolytic hydrogen plant in Georgia, the largest in the U.S., marks a significant milestone in the company’s efforts to build a vertically integrated hydrogen ecosystem.

Additionally, Plug operates a 10 TPD plant in Tennessee and plans to open a 15 TPD liquid hydrogen facility in Louisiana by the end of 2024.

Plug Power is also working on future plant developments across the U.S. and collaborating with key strategic suppliers to expand its green hydrogen network.

Earlier this week, Plug Power accomplished a milestone with over 7.5 GW in global Basic Engineering and Design Package (BEDP) contracts.

Plug Power stock lost 74% in the last 12 months. In May, the company reported a first-quarter fiscal 2024 net revenue decline of 42.8% year-over-year to $120.264 million, missing the analyst consensus estimate of $157.58 million, reflecting seasonality in equipment sales.

Price Action: PLUG shares are trading higher by 3.25% to $2.54 premarket at last check Friday.

Yahoo Finance,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/bitcoin-crypto-closing-lame-quarter-154624985.html,2024-06-28,15:46:24 UTC,Bitcoin and Crypto Closing Out Lame Quarter and One Analyst Believes More Pain Could Be in Store,"A powerful start to 2024 had the bulls predicting $100,000 bitcoin {{BTC}} at some point this year, but relentless selling pressure during April and June (interrupted by a May bounce) has the price struggling not to drop below $60,000 as the quarter draws to a close.

Entering the second quarter, bitcoin was trading just shy of the $71,000 level and at press time (about 60 hours before Q2 officially closes) was changing hands at $60,800, a decline of more than 14%. Helped by the tailwind of what now appears to be certain spot ETF approval, ether {{ETH}} outperformed, but was still in the red in the second quarter with about a 5% drop.

Dragged down by even larger declines in many altcoins, the broader CoinDesk Index fell more than 21% during the last three months. Among the movers, Solana {{SOL}} tumbled 30%, Ripple's {{XRP}} dropped 23% and Dogecoin {{DOGE}} plunged 42%. The index's best performer was the above-mentioned ether with its 5% slide.

Positive catalysts vanish

Bitcoin's disappointing second quarter price action, for now, can possibly be thought of as a correction within a larger bull move that saw the token rise nearly five-fold from January 2023 lows to a new all-time record above $73,500 in mid-March of this year.

Anticipation of the spot bitcoin ETF approval, then the approval, and then the massive inflows into the new funds were surely major catalysts for the rise. Also in play were macro factors – namely the anticipation of a sizable series of interest rate cuts in 2024 from the U.S. Federal Reserve. Inflation, however, has failed to cooperate, and to date there has been no easing of monetary policy in the U.S., with more than one member of the central bank now not expecting to cut rates even once this year.

With ETF inflows old news and even on occasion reversing to outflows, and hopes for lower interest rates diminishing daily, buyers appear to have taken to the sidelines until a new catalyst arises.

More pain in store in Q3?

Bitcoin entered a downtrend on June 20, writes Markus Thielen at 10X Research, laying out ten reasons why the price could decline to $55,000 in the near term. Thielen noted that many trend-following funds are looking at the same signals and might be inclined to pile into short positions.

In addition, while some bulls may have been excited that the presidential debate seemed to favor Donald Trump – who has recently come out as notably pro-crypto and pro-bitcoin – Thielen suggested President Biden's poor performance heightened the chance of a replacement Democratic nominee who might end up as a far more formidable opponent in the November election.

Story continues

(Reuters) -A federal judge in Texas on Friday temporarily blocked a Biden administration rule from taking effect that would extend mandatory overtime pay to 4 million salaried U.S. workers.

U.S. District Judge Sean Jordan in Sherman, Texas, said the U.S. Department of Labor rule that is set to go into effect on Monday improperly bases eligibility for overtime pay on workers' wages rather than their job duties.

Jordan, an appointee of Republican former President Donald Trump, blocked the Labor Department from applying the rule to state workers in Texas pending the outcome of a legal challenge by the Republican-led state.

The Labor Department and the office of Republican Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton did not immediately respond to requests for comment.

The department can seek review of the ruling in the New Orleans-based 5th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals, which is widely regarded as the most conservative federal appeals court.

The rule adopted in April would require employers to pay overtime premiums to salaried workers who earn less than $1,128 per week, or about $58,600 per year, when they work more than 40 hours in a week. The current threshold of about $35,500 was set in 2019.

Federal law exempts workers with ""executive, administrative, and professional"" (EAP) duties from receiving overtime pay, and the Labor Department has for decades used salary as one factor in deciding when that applies.

In adopting the rule, the department said that lower-paid salaried workers often do the same jobs as their hourly counterparts, but work more hours for no additional pay.

The rule also establishes automatic increases in the salary threshold every three years to reflect wage growth.

Texas in its lawsuit said the rule violates federal law by conditioning overtime exemptions primarily on workers' pay rather than their duties, and is seeking to strike it down nationwide.

Texas says that subjecting states to the overtime expansion violates their right under the U.S. Constitution to structure the pay of state employees and, in turn, decide how to allocate large portions of their budgets.

Jordan on Friday agreed that the Labor Department had overstepped its authority by effectively rewriting federal law.

""Since the ordinary meaning of the EAP Exemption focuses solely on duties, any rule implementing the EAP Exemption - including the 2024 Rule — must likewise center on duties,"" the judge wrote.

Jordan is also presiding over a challenge to the rule by business groups, and a small marketing firm is suing over the regulation in a different federal court in Texas.

Focus today turns to core PCE inflation

Yen slides, intervention risks rise

French citizens head to the ballots on Sunday

Trump Election Win Bets Support Dollar

The traded slightly lower against most of its major peers on Thursday, extending gains only against the and the . That said, the greenback is on the front foot again today, gaining the most ground versus the and the .

What helped the dollar move higher during the Asian session today may have been the debate between the 2024 presidential candidates Joe Biden and Donald Trump, with the latter seen as putting in a stronger showing than the incumbent President.

The likelihood of Trump returning to the Oval Office could mean lower corporate taxes, tougher trade relations, and consequently more advances on Wall Street and higher Treasury yields. The prospect of more tariffs on China may be the reason why the dollar is gaining the most against the aussie and the kiwi, as China is the main trading partner of both Australia and New Zealand.

PCE Inflation Expected to Cool

Today, dollar traders are likely to turn their attention to the core PCE price index for May, the Fed’s favorite inflation metric. Expectations are for a slowdown to 2.6% y/y from 2.8%, something supported by the slide in the core CPI rate for the month.

Currently, market participants are penciling in around a 70% chance of a first quarter-point reduction by the Fed in September. Thus, a slide in the core PCE rate may encourage them to take that percentage higher and thereby sell some dollars.

Yen Traders Stay on Intervention Watch

The yen continued to bleed, with the dollar/yen briefly breaking above 161 earlier today as traders continued to test the nerves of Japanese authorities, which have lately become vocal again about one-sided declines in their currency.

The acceleration in the Tokyo CPI figures for June passed unnoticed by yen traders, though the probability of another 10bps hike by the BoJ in July remained elevated at around 60%.

What’s even more interesting is that today, the Japanese government replaced the nation’s top currency diplomat Masato Kanda with financial regulation expert Atsushi Mimura. With Finance Minister Suzuki noting that authorities remain “deeply concerned” about the impact of steep yen declines, Kanda’s replacement may have increased the risk for a new intervention episode soon.

In light of this, yen traders may now be keener to cover some of their short positions to minimize potential losses in case of intervention, something that could result in a small setback in the dollar/yen.

French Election, Round One

In Europe, the spotlight is turning to the first round of the French elections. If no candidate gets an absolute majority, which is the most likely case, the top two candidates, and any other that receives more than 12.5% of the registered votes, move to a second round.

Opinion polls suggest that Le Pen’s far-right National Rally is likely to secure the most seats in Parliament, but not a majority. The far-left New Popular Front is seen second and Macron’s Ensemble coalition third.

This first round could shed light on how likely it is for Le Pen to form a coalition with smaller parties after the second round, or whether the nation will be left with a completely hung parliament. Given that no election can take place for another year under the French Constitution after this, a hung parliament may be the worst-case scenario for the as the Eurozone’s second-largest economy will enter a prolonged period of political stalemate.","PCE Inflation Expected to CoolToday, dollar traders are likely to turn their attention to the core PCE price index for May, the Fed’s favorite inflation metric.

The (XAU) price rose by more than 1% on Thursday as the (USD) weakened after weaker-than-expected core durable goods orders and housing data.

Yesterday's US macroeconomic statistics underscored the slowing of the economy. Specifically, yesterday's final Gross Domestic Product data revealed a significant decrease in the US economic growth in Q1. Additionally, business spending on equipment fell in May, while a decline in exports widened the trade deficit in goods. As a result, the probability of two rate cuts from the Federal Reserve (Fed) in 2024 increased, pushing the US dollar down and making gold more attractive for holders of other currencies.

Moreover, investors were anticipating the debate between two US presidential candidates. The market also closely monitored any signs that the Japanese government might step in to support the Japanese yen, which remained near its lowest level in 38 years. This uncertainty boosted the demand for gold, a traditional safe-haven asset during economic and political turmoil.

XAU/USD was falling during the Asian and early European trading session as traders focused on the key US inflation data, which is due later today. The US Bureau of Economic Analysis will release its Personal Consumption Expenditure (PCE) Price Index at 12:30 p.m. UTC. The data is the Fed's preferred measure of inflation, and the report will likely have a major impact on investors' interest rate expectations. If PCE figures are higher than expected, XAU/USD will almost certainly drop, possibly below 2,290. Conversely, lower-than-expected numbers may extend the short-term bullish trend in gold.

""Spot gold may retest support at $2,299 per ounce, as the bounce triggered by this barrier is considered random"", said Reuters analyst Wang Tao.

The Euro Rises on a Weaker US Dollar, but French Elections Produce Uncertainty

The (EUR) gained 0.22% against the US dollar (USD) on Thursday but failed to hold above the important 1.07150 level.

Soft economic data from the US sparked a sell-off in the US dollar yesterday, as investors continue to believe that the Federal Reserve (Fed) will deliver two rate cuts in 2024. Meanwhile, the European Central Bank (ECB) is also expected to provide two 25-basis-point (bps) rate cuts this year, but the market is confident that the ECB should generally remain more dovish than the Fed. Germany reported yesterday that its import prices dropped by 0.4% in May, while the market anticipated only a 0.3% decline. The euro faces additional pressure from political instability as France gears up for a snap election this weekend. France is already subject to E.U. disciplinary measures due to its budget deficit. Now, the fact that far-right nationalist parties are leading the polls has further exacerbated concerns about France's fiscal sustainability.

EUR/USD was falling during the Asian and early European trading session as traders started to reposition ahead of today's US Personal Consumption Expenditure (PCE) Price Index report, due at 12:30 p.m. UTC. It is the Fed's preferred measure of inflation and will likely have a major impact on investors' interest rate expectations. If the figures are higher than expected, EUR/USD will likely drop, possibly below the 1.06600 level. Otherwise, the pair may rise above 1.07200.

Bitcoin Surged on Trump-Biden Debate

(BTC) rose overnight by more than 1% as the market favored Trump in a debate with Biden.

Bitcoin was trading near 61,485 before the debate between two presidential candidates began but quickly surged towards 62,157 as Donald Trump and Joe Biden responded to questions from CNN moderators. Although not directly mentioned in the debate, cryptocurrency has become a significant point of interest in the election confrontation. On 16 June, Trump stated he would end Biden's 'war on crypto' if he is elected. In March, Trump made a post expressing his intention to make the US a global leader in crypto technology and criticized Biden, saying the current President would see crypto 'die a slow and painful death'.

However, President Biden recently vetoed a resolution that would have repealed a Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) accounting guideline preventing banks from holding crypto assets on their balance sheets. Notably, the resolution passed through both the House and the Senate with majority support. Biden explained his decision, saying he refused to pass legislation that would 'jeopardize the well-being of consumers and investors'.

After the debates, slowly returned towards 61,485 in the Asian and early European trading sessions. Today, traders should focus on the release of the US Personal Consumption Expenditures (PCE) Price Index at 12:30 p.m. UTC. In theory, lower-than-expected figures should positively impact BTC/USD, potentially pushing the price above 62,000. However, the bearish trend in the pair may continue if the figures are better than expected.","The US Bureau of Economic Analysis will release its Personal Consumption Expenditure (PCE) Price Index at 12:30 p.m. UTC.

In Europe, the business and consumer survey came in slightly lower than expected, the lost more than 1%, and the fell. The German stocks did better than their European peers as some big names like Siemens and SAP outperformed, while in the UK, the sank below its 50-DMA despite a softer pound and a positive breakout in oil prices.

finally cleared the critical $82pb resistance and returned to the positive trend that was building at the start of the year. The April to June selloff is fully behind us now, trend and momentum indicators remain positive while the market is not yet in the overbought territory meaning that there is room for further gains in the short run.

From a technical perspective, the outlook has improved. From a fundamental point of view, news are supportive as well. Yesterday’s GDP update from the US confirmed that the US economy slowed in Q1 to grow just 1.4%, but the print was slightly better than the 1.3% expected, and down from 3.4% printed a quarter earlier. Sales and consumer spending halved, and inventories rose. Price indications were not enchanting but investors looked past these components as the uptick we saw in first quarter inflation is thought to have slowed past the Q1. All in all data was positive for the reflation trade.

Other than that, the US trade deficit widened to the highest levels in 2 years, pending home sales fell 2% and the jobless claims rose to the highest levels since last summer. Data hinted at further slowdown in the US economy, but the slowdown didn’t look catastrophic. As such, the data-fueled the dovish Fed expectations and boosted appetite for the US treasuries, as well, along with a strong sale of bonds, following good sales of and bonds earlier in the week.

The US 2-year yield tested but remained above the 4.70% level, the yield fluctuated near 4.30%. The and eked out small gains as Federal Reserve (Fed) rate cut hopes rose, with some investors expecting up to two rate cuts from now to the end of the year, and the eased but rebounded in Asia as the presidential debate between Trump and Biden favoured - Trump.

There is one more thing to watch before this weekends: the core PCE data – the Fed’s favourite gauge of inflation that’s expected to show further weakness in both headline and core numbers. If that’s the case, combined with yesterday’s softish growth data, we could see the Fed doves remain in charge of the market. The latter could help broaden the US stock rally to non-tech sectors, and toward the reflation-friendly European markets.

Euro Under Pressure

Some Eurozone countries will reveal their preliminary inflation numbers for June today. Sufficiently soft data is needed to keep the European Central Bank (ECB) doves alive, but for the euro, the upcoming French election this weekend is probably more important than the inflation figures as regardless of the data – unless we see something very much unexpected – many investors will probably chose to go into the French election weekend without a positive exposure to the euro given that Marine Le Pen’s National Rally is seen securing one vote out of three, and that’s not the outcome that the market is happy with.

The spread between the French and German 10-year yield is back above 80bp and could further widen depending on the French election outcome. Higher yield differential means lower appetite for euro. It could be that a blow to Macron has already priced in (and overly priced in) and the euro could rebound in a typical ‘buy the rumour sell the fact’ move on Monday open, but volatility will likely be on the menu and the euro could – regardless of the inflation figures on both sides of the Atlantic – further ease against the greenback before the weekly close. The currently trades below 1.07 mark. We could see the pair fall below the 1.0660 level – which acted as a support since Macron called for the snap election.

Jordan on Friday agreed that the Labor Department had overstepped its authority by effectively rewriting federal law.","['labor', 'pay', 'court', 'rule', 'block', 'wins', 'biden', 'workers', 'federal', 'department', 'duties', 'salaried', 'texas', 'overtime']",https://i-invdn-com.investing.com/news/STOCK-EXCHANGE-RUSSIAN-TRADING-SYSTEMS_800x533_L_1414427815.jpg,True,daniel wiessner reuter a feder judg texa friday temporarili block biden administr rule take effect would extend mandatori overtim pay million salari us worker us district judg sean jordan sherman texa said us depart labor rule set go effect monday improp base elig overtim pay worker wage rather job duti jordan appointe republican former presid donald trump block labor depart appli rule state worker texa pend outcom legal challeng republicanl state labor depart offic republican texa attorney general ken paxton immedi respond request comment depart seek review rule new orleansbas th us circuit court appeal wide regard conserv feder appeal court rule adopt april would requir employ pay overtim premium salari worker earn less per week per year work hour week current threshold set feder law exempt worker execut administr profession eap duti receiv overtim pay labor depart decad use salari one factor decid appli adopt rule depart said lowerpaid salari worker often job hour counterpart work hour addit pay rule also establish automat increas salari threshold everi three year reflect wage growth texa lawsuit said rule violat feder law condit overtim exempt primarili worker pay rather duti seek strike nationwid texa say subject state overtim expans violat right us constitut structur pay state employe and turn decid alloc larg portion budget jordan friday agre labor depart overstep author effect rewrit feder law sinc ordinari mean eap exempt focus sole duti rule implement eap exempt includ rule -- must likewis center duti judg wrote jordan also presid challeng rule busi group small market firm su regul differ feder court texa

(Reuters) -U.S. stocks ended weaker on Friday after an early rally fizzled as investors digested in-line inflation data and weighed political uncertainty after the U.S. presidential debate.

Nike (NYSE: ) had its steepest one-day fall in over two decades after a gloomy forecast.

""I don't think the inflation number changes much because the Federal Reserve has been pretty serious about their 2% target and remains disciplined,"" said Ann Miletti, Allspring's head of active equity.

Data showed U.S. monthly inflation was unchanged in May, an encouraging development after strong price increases earlier this year raised doubts over the effectiveness of the Fed's monetary policy.

The Commerce Department report also showed consumer spending rose marginally last month, fueling optimism that the U.S. central bank could engineer a much-desired ""soft landing"" for the economy.

Bets on a rate cut in September rose to 66% after the personal consumption expenditures price index release, LSEG FedWatch data showed.

Traders have maintained bets on two cuts despite Fed projections of just one this year, as they hope inflation will keep cooling.

The first debate on Thursday between U.S. President Joe Biden and Republican rival Donald Trump also weighed on stocks, said Thomas Martin, senior portfolio manager at Globalt Investments, citing the incumbent's shaky performance.

""People are trying to think about what's going to happen with the presidential election. So instead of uncertainty decreasing after the debate, it's increased,"" he said.

Treasury yields reversed early losses to end higher, adding pressure on some megacap stocks.

San Francisco Fed President Mary Daly acknowledged the cooling inflation, and noted that it is ""good news that policy is working."" Fed Governor Michelle Bowman said the central bank would follow its own path as its inflation goal has yet to be reached.

The energy and real estate were the top performers, up 0.42% and 0.62%, while utilities and communications services fell 1.08% and 1.63%, respectively.

Nike slumped 19.98% after forecasting a surprise drop in fiscal 2025 revenue, weighing on the broader consumer discretionary sector.

The fell 41.12 points, or 0.11%, to 39,122.94. The S&P 500 lost 22.57 points, or 0.41%, at 5,460.30 and the dropped 126.08 points, or 0.71%, to 17,732.60.

Volume surged toward the closing bell when the Russell finalized the reconstitution of its indexes. It was the second biggest daily volume of the year.

The S&P 500 and the Nasdaq indexes registered quarterly gains of 3.9% and 8.3%, respectively. The Dow dropped 1.7%, highlighting the divergence between the more tech-heavy indexes and the rest of the market.

Among individual stocks, optical networking gear maker Infinera (NASDAQ: ) jumped 15.78% after Nokia (HE: ) said it would acquire the company in a $2.3 billion deal.

Advancing issues outnumbered decliners by a 1.29-to-1 ratio on the NYSE, which had 271 new highs and 75 new lows.

LONDON/NEW YORK (Reuters) - The unstoppable march of the mega caps, sloth-like central bank pivots, political palpitations aplenty and M&A is back - the first half of 2024 has been another whirlwind in world markets.

Forecasts for a global interest-rate-cutting frenzy may not have materialized, but Nvidia (NASDAQ: ) and the rest of the Magnificent 7 soared another $3.6 trillion in market value.

MSCI's 47-country world stocks index has clocked up a punchy 11% since January. Good yes, but nowhere near the 30% leap of team tech, or the frankly eye-popping 150% gain of chip champ Nvidia.

""Thirty percent of the S&P's returns this year have come from Nvidia alone,"" the chief investment officer of IBOSS Asset Management Chris Metcalfe said, pointing out it was now the most expensive stock on the most expensive market in the world.

It is not just equity markets where milestones have been set.

Japan's yen has bowed to a 38-year low against the dollar in currency markets. Cocoa had one of its best-ever runs while French bond risk has exploded to its highest level since the euro crisis after French President Emmanuel Macron's drubbing by the far right in EU elections this month drove him to call a snap parliamentary election on Sunday.

Government bonds had been having a tough time anyway. Predictions of a gush of rate cuts have turned out to be just a dribble in a few parts of Europe and emerging markets and certainly not in the United States yet.

As a result, anyone owning a basket of benchmark bonds has lost around 1.5% of their money.

""At the end of last year, the markets expected seven (U.S.) rate cuts and now they are expecting just one or two,"" Nadege Dufosse, the head of multi-asset at Candriam said. ""That has been the big driver and explains the (poor) performance.""

A shaky performance from U.S. President Joe Biden in his latest TV debate against Donald Trump has just ratcheted November's U.S. election uncertainty up substantially.

There's also a general election in Britain on July 4 although there aren't expected to be many market fireworks despite it being almost certainly the first change of government in 14 years.

Polar Capital fund manager Georgina Hamilton explained that was because unlike in France and the U.S., the two main candidates to lead the UK are fairly centrist.

""Having had quite a lot of turmoil in recent years ... you can't underestimate that calmer political backdrop,"" she added.

GOLD SHINES

The big story in commodities has been cocoa sky-rocketing almost 85% due to shortages which is already its second-biggest annual leap of all time, although certainly is not good news for chocoholics.

Gold hit a record high of just shy of $2,450 an ounce last month. Oil is up a respectable 12% while bitcoin broke though $70,000 and set a flurry of new highs after U.S. watchdogs gave bitcoin exchange-traded funds the green light.

The value of global M&A activity is up 5% compared to last year.

That's mainly down to a brace of $35-billion deals that saw credit-card firm Capital One take over Discover Financial and chip designer Synopsys (NASDAQ: ) buy out rival Ansys (NASDAQ: ), although it could have been much more though if BHP's gripping $49-billion pursuit of Anglo American (JO: ) had succeeded.

DISTRESSED TO IMPRESS

Off the beaten track, Ecuador's bonds have made 46% despite lingering debt concerns and Argentina's new chainsaw-wielding President Javier Milei has helped its bonds jump 32%.

Emerging-market veteran Kevin Daly at Aberdeen said there has been a ""distressed to impress"" move, with the bonds of crashed countries like Zambia, Ghana and Sri Lanka all rallying between 16%-23% as their years-long debt restructurings have neared an end.

As always though, there has still been plenty of downs in emerging markets.

Chinese property stocks have fallen for the ninth quarter in a row. Devaluations have shoved Nigeria's and Egypt's currencies down 42% and 36% respectively, while Mexico's peso is down nearly 8% this month after a resounding presidential election result fed worries about its future path.","By Marc Jones and Rodrigo CamposLONDON/NEW YORK (Reuters) - The unstoppable march of the mega caps, sloth-like central bank pivots, political palpitations aplenty and M&A is back - the first half of 2024 has been another whirlwind in world markets.

NEW YORK (Reuters) -The U.S. dollar slipped on Friday after data showed inflation in the world's largest economy subsided last month, cementing expectations the Federal Reserve will start cutting interest rates this year.

The dollar initially fell against the yen, the currency pair most sensitive to U.S. economic data because of a high, positive correlation to Treasury yields. The greenback, however, edged higher to trade flat on the day, with investors still focused on the wide interest rate differential between the United States and Japan.

The dollar was last up slightly against the Japanese unit at 160.815 yen, after earlier hitting a 38-year high of 161.27 yen. Traders remained on high alert for intervention from Japanese authorities to boost its currency.

The U.S. currency has posted monthly and quarterly gains versus the yen of about 1.9% and 5.9%, respectively.

Data showed the U.S. personal consumption expenditures (PCE) price index, the Fed's preferred inflation measure, was unchanged last month, and followed an unrevised 0.3% gain in April, data showed. In the 12 months through May, the PCE price index increased 2.6% after advancing 2.7% in April.

""The PCE report was mostly in line with expectations, which confirms the disinflationary trend as shown by the CPI (consumer price index), PPI (producer price index) numbers earlier this month,"" said Boris Kovacevic, global macro strategist at Convera in Vienna, Austria. ""The macro data continues to point to a softening of the U.S. economy.""

Following the inflation data, fed funds futures slightly raised the chances of easing in September to around 67%, from about 65% late Thursday, according to LSEG calculations. The market is also pricing between one to two rate cuts of 25 bps each this year.

A separate report on Thursday showed business activity in the Midwest came in better than expected, modestly helping the dollar. The Chicago purchasing managers' index (PMI) jumped to 47.4 from 35 in May, and better than the 40 that economists projected.

University of Michigan consumer sentiment, meanwhile, showed a reading of a better-than-expected 68.2 for June, also dollar-supportive. In addition, respondents to the sentiment survey expect near- and long-term inflation expectations to level out at 3%.

Investors will now focus on next week's U.S. nonfarm payrolls report, in which Wall Street economists are forecasting a gain of 195,000 in June, compared with 272,000 in May.

""Next week’s employment report will give us the opportunity to see if the job market is slowing,"" said David Donabedian, chief investment officer of CIBC Private Wealth, in emailed comments.

""This number will have to be a big surprise to the downside to suggest the Fed will act in July to lower rates. We expect the Fed to stay pat unless the job market starts to falter.""

In other currencies, the euro was up 0.1% at $1.0709 .

The euro, down 1.3% against the dollar in June, was on track for its biggest monthly fall since January as political uncertainty weighed in the run-up to France's general elections.

For the second quarter, Europe's single currency fell 0.7%.

Investors fear a new French government could increase fiscal spending, threatening the sustainability of the country's public debt and the financial stability of the bloc.

Against the Swiss franc, the dollar was little changed at 0.8986 francs.

Aside from the economic data, market participants were also focused on U.S. politics.

Republican U.S. presidential candidate Donald Trump unleashed a barrage of at-times false attacks on President Joe Biden in their first campaign debate in Atlanta, with the dollar rising as Biden stumbled over his words a few times in early exchanges.

The debate increased the odds of a Trump presidency and the imposition of import tariffs. Traders bought dollars overall as a Trump administration suggests more aggressive tariffs that could be inflationary and could trigger higher interest rates.
