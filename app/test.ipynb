      "            \"body\": \"Nike shoes and logo are seen at a store in Nice, France on May 28, 2024.\\n\\nShares of Nike plunged on Friday after the retailer cut its full-year guidance and said it expects sales to drop 10% during its current quarter as it warned of soft sales in China and \\\"uneven\\\" consumer trends across the globe.\\n\\nThe expected 10% first-quarter slump is far below the 3.2% drop that analysts had expected, according to LSEG.\\n\\nNike shares plunged nearly 20% in trading Friday.\\n\\nThe sneaker giant, which reported quarterly earnings Thursday, now expects fiscal 2025 sales to be down mid-single digits, compared to analyst estimates of a 0.9% increase. Nike previously expected sales to grow. The company also expects sales in the first half to be down in the high single digits, compared to previous guidance of declines in the low single digits.\\n\\n\\\"A comeback at this scale takes time,\\\" the retailer's finance chief Matthew Friend said on a call with analysts Thursday. \\\"Although the next few quarters will be challenging, we are confident that we are repositioning Nike to be more competitive with a more balanced portfolio to drive sustainable, profitable, long-term growth.\\\"\\n\\nThe company cut its guidance as it contends with slower online sales, planned declines in classic footwear franchises, \\\"increased macro uncertainty\\\" in the Greater China region and \\\"uneven consumer trends\\\" across Nike's markets, Friend said. It also expects sales into wholesalers to be slower as it scales new innovations and pulls back on classic franchises.\\n\\nFor the fiscal fourth quarter, the company handily beat earnings estimates as its cost-cutting efforts continue to bear fruit, but Nike fell short on revenue.\\n\\nHere's how Nike did during the period compared with what Wall Street was anticipating, based on a survey of analysts by LSEG:\\n\\nEarnings per share: $1.01 adjusted vs. 83 cents expected\\n\\n$1.01 adjusted vs. 83 cents expected Revenue: $12.61 billion vs. $12.84 billion expected\\n\\nThe company's reported net income for the three-month period that ended May 31 was $1.5 billion, or 99 cents per share, compared with $1.03 billion, or 66 cents per share, a year earlier.\\n\\nSales dropped to $12.61 billion, down about 2% from $12.83 billion a year earlier.\\n\\nIn fiscal 2024, Nike posted sales of $51.36 billion, which is flat compared to the prior year. It's the slowest pace of annual sales growth the company has seen since 2010, excluding the Covid-19 pandemic.\\n\\nNike executives attributed the sales miss to a range of factors. They said its lifestyle business declined during the quarter and that momentum in its performance business, such as its basketball and running shoes, wasn't enough to offset it.\\n\\nOnline performance was soft because Nike had a higher share of lifestyle products, more promotions and fewer sales of classic franchises, such as its Air Force 1.

      "            \"body\": \"Nike shoes and logo are seen at a store in Nice, France on May 28, 2024.\\n\\nShares of Nike plunged on Friday after the retailer cut its full-year guidance and said it expects sales to drop 10% during its current quarter as it warned of soft sales in China and \\\"uneven\\\" consumer trends across the globe.\\n\\nThe expected 10% first-quarter slump is far below the 3.2% drop that analysts had expected, according to LSEG.\\n\\nNike shares plunged nearly 20% in trading Friday.\\n\\nThe sneaker giant, which reported quarterly earnings Thursday, now expects fiscal 2025 sales to be down mid-single digits, compared to analyst estimates of a 0.9% increase. Nike previously expected sales to grow. The company also expects sales in the first half to be down in the high single digits, compared to previous guidance of declines in the low single digits.\\n\\n\\\"A comeback at this scale takes time,\\\" the retailer's finance chief Matthew Friend said on a call with analysts Thursday. \\\"Although the next few quarters will be challenging, we are confident that we are repositioning Nike to be more competitive with a more balanced portfolio to drive sustainable, profitable, long-term growth.\\\"\\n\\nThe company cut its guidance as it contends with slower online sales, planned declines in classic footwear franchises, \\\"increased macro uncertainty\\\" in the Greater China region and \\\"uneven consumer trends\\\" across Nike's markets, Friend said. It also expects sales into wholesalers to be slower as it scales new innovations and pulls back on classic franchises.\\n\\nFor the fiscal fourth quarter, the company handily beat earnings estimates as its cost-cutting efforts continue to bear fruit, but Nike fell short on revenue.\\n\\nHere's how Nike did during the period compared with what Wall Street was anticipating, based on a survey of analysts by LSEG:\\n\\nEarnings per share: $1.01 adjusted vs. 83 cents expected\\n\\n$1.01 adjusted vs. 83 cents expected Revenue: $12.61 billion vs. $12.84 billion expected\\n\\nThe company's reported net income for the three-month period that ended May 31 was $1.5 billion, or 99 cents per share, compared with $1.03 billion, or 66 cents per share, a year earlier.\\n\\nSales dropped to $12.61 billion, down about 2% from $12.83 billion a year earlier.\\n\\nIn fiscal 2024, Nike posted sales of $51.36 billion, which is flat compared to the prior year. It's the slowest pace of annual sales growth the company has seen since 2010, excluding the Covid-19 pandemic.\\n\\nNike executives attributed the sales miss to a range of factors. They said its lifestyle business declined during the quarter and that momentum in its performance business, such as its basketball and running shoes, wasn't enough to offset it.\\n\\nOnline performance was soft because Nike had a higher share of lifestyle products, more promotions and fewer sales of classic franchises, such as its Air Force 1. It also saw traffic in China decline across all channels beginning in April due to macro conditions in the region.\\n\\nDespite the traffic decline in China, sales in the region exceeded Wall Street expectations, according to StreetAccount, coming in at $1.86 billion, compared with estimates of $1.79 billion.

      "            \"body\": \"Robert Way\\n\\nOn Thursday, Nike (NYSE:NKE) reported fourth-quarter fiscal 2024 earnings results after the market closed that were generally inline with lowered analyst expectations, but the stock sold off sharply after the company disclosed that first quarter revenues are to decline by 10%. What began as modest selling in the stock has snowballed to a 20% decline on Friday. The severity of the decline has upstaged Nike's previous worst day stock performance. I have a small long position in Nike, and I am reviewing it in light of the recent results. Nike is a strong brand and its stock price is headed to the discount rack, while I consider the selling to be overdone, the prospect of a prolonged turnaround leads me to expect that there are better ways for investors to deploy fresh capital at the present time.\\n\\nThe Good, the Bad and the Ugly\\n\\nRevenues and earnings for the fourth quarter that ended May 31st were $12.6 billion, down 2 percent on a reported basis and flat on a currency neutral basis. Net income came in at $1.5 billion, up 45% from the previous year's fourth quarter, with diluted earnings reported at $1.01/share or $0.17/share above analyst estimates.\\n\\nNike Q4 2024 Earnings Release (Nike Investor Relations)\\n\\nA bright spot was that SG&A costs were well contained in an inflationary environment, with gross margins expanding slightly from 43.6% to 44.7%. In addition, the company's buyback significantly reduced diluted shares outstanding from 1,556.3 million in Q4 2023 to 1,516.7 million by Q4 2024, a reduction of 2.54%. The share repurchase cost $4.3 billion over the fiscal year as part of an $18 billion four-year program authorized by the board of directors since June 2022. Shares were repurchased over the previous year at an average cost of approximately $103/share. Thus, a silver lining during the selling is that the remaining 2-year buyback will retire considerably more shares given the lower stock price.\\n\\nMoving on to \\\"the bad,\\\" I would characterize the company's failure to innovate in recent years as befitting this category. A recent piece in the WSJ highlights the waning interest of the running community with Nike products. Despite avid interest in road-running since the pandemic, Nike has been conspicuously absent from road demos. For a company built on the reputation of the legendary American runner Steve Prefontaine, the lack of execution is concerning.\\n\\nFollowing the pandemic, customers have been more engaged online than in brick and mortar stores, thus under performance of NIKE's digital brand was also concerning. On the earnings call, Matthew Friend, Nike's CFO reported that:\\n\\n\\\"NIKE Digital declined 10% in the quarter. Although our digital business has grown at an approximately 26% CAGR since fiscal 2019, we missed our Q4 plan on softer traffic, higher promotions, and lower sales of certain classic footwear franchises. More specifically, these franchises underperformed our overall digital business results in the quarter, especially in April and May, and continuing on into early June.\\\"\\n\\nMatt continued onto the ugly part of the call:\\n\\n\\\"Now turning to our first quarter, we expect first quarter revenue to be down approximately 10%. This reflects more aggressive actions in managing our classic footwear franchises, continuing challenges on NIKE Digital, muted wholesale order books with newness not yet at scale, a softer outlook in greater China, and a number of quarter-specific timing factors. We expect first quarter gross margins to be in line with the full-year guidance.\\\"\\n\\nThe call continued with the CFO identifying three major factors behind the 10% revenue decline:\\n\\nForeign Exchange: The strength of the US dollar on foreign exchange has had a 1% impact versus 90 days prior.\\n\\nThe strength of the US dollar on foreign exchange has had a 1% impact versus 90 days prior. Softening Economy in China: China accounts for $1.74 billion or 13.4% of Nike's revenues. The softening Chinese economy has materially harmed Nike's revenues.\\n\\nChina accounts for $1.74 billion or 13.4% of Nike's revenues. The softening Chinese economy has materially harmed Nike's revenues. Impact on Total Digital: The slowdown in digital was attributed as a major component of the remaining revenue decrease, along with \\\"key franchises across the total marketplace.\\\"\\n\\nIn total, the company expects revenue for the fiscal 2025 year to fall by \\\"mid-single digits,\\\" after earlier guiding for overall sales growth this year. Clearly the business has meaningfully slowed down in the past 90 days and the market was not pleased. The company has a catalyst in the 2024 Paris Olympics this summer; however, the damage has been done and 2024 will certainly be a turnaround year.\\n\\nValuing Nike by Discounted Cash Flow\\n\\nToday, it could be argued based on past growth and projections that Nike is becoming cheap, even with the prospect of an extended turnaround. This analysis depends on several factors, notably:\\n\\nProjected Revenue Growth: The model expects a \\\"single-digit\\\" decline in Nike's revenue from $51.22 billion at its peak in fiscal 2024 to $49.15 billion in the coming year and continuing after this year to $47.94 billion. Coming off an historical 11.0% 3-year revenue growth CAGR, the model projects a rebound to last year's peak revenues two years thereafter. As a margin of safety, I am making the assumption that the forecast revenue decline will not be a blip on the radar and will take an additional year to hit bottom and two years thereafter to return to growth.\\n\\nNet Balance Sheet Impact: Nike has a pristine balance sheet with little long-term debt and an AA- credit rating. The company has held leverage over the past 3 years at around 1.26x EBITDA, a low level evinced by the small 5.9% segment of debt in the overall capital structure.\\n\\nDiscount Rate: Interest rates remain elevated, and Nike's DCF valuation is dependent on the discount rate applied. The model assumes a cost of equity of 8.5%. Growth of 5% is assumed after peak revenue is reached until 2033, after which 3% growth is assumed. Expenses are assumed to scale with revenues (constant profit margins). This leads to a final mid-point valuation of $123.7 billion ($79/share).\\n\\nDCF Analysis of Nike (Excel)\\n\\nIn total, Nike appears to have some margin of safety after the recent share price decline, even with relatively pessimistic growth assumptions. Therefore, on a valuation basis, I am constructive on the stock.\\n\\nHowever, analyst expectations for growth still appear to be considerably above my expectations for the company. While analysts have reduced fiscal 2025 revenue forecasts to $49.15 billion, they are expected to rebound by fiscal 2026, hitting all-time high revenues of $52.32 billion. Revenue growth thereafter is projected to return to the high single digits. My gut tells me that Nike will take more than this length of time to reestablish record revenue.\\n\\nNike Revenue Growth Estimates (Seeking Alpha)\\n\\nGiven the challenges that Nike faces, I am not expecting a robust and immediate turn-around. With analysts still expecting growth just beyond the current fiscal year, buyers of the stock today will still be disappointed until Nike returns to robust growth. If the current analyst forecasts need to be reduced moving forward, it will tend toward pushing the stock price lower.\\n\\nReaders who agree with the analysts' expectations, should consider the stock to be a screaming buy at these prices, however, with the prospect of a prolonged turnaround, I am not planning to add to my small position, but will continue to watch the stock.\\n\\nConclusion\\n\\nSince CEO John Donahoe took the helm of Nike in January 2020, Nike made robust inroads into e-commerce that have stalled in recent quarters. Furthermore, execution in the company's core business has been subpar, with some analysts questioning if management is up to the task of navigating this turnaround.\\n\\nFollowing the disastrous earnings call this week, investors have the opportunity to purchase a wonderful company at a fair price, but I expect there is no hurry to do so as the company is in the midst of a painful turn-around. Buyers of Nike stock at the present time should have a very patient mindset.\\n\\nAs of this writing, the market capitalization of Nike is around $112.6 billion, putting the company at 2.19x sales of $51.36 billion and 19.75x earnings of $5.70 billion. While this is the very low end of valuation that has been available since 2012, it is a rather average valuation for the ten years before. Without growth, this is a fairly average valuation in today's market.\\n\\nTo take on the risk of a turnaround, I prefer very deep value and Nike is presently a hold rather than accumulate, but could become a buy if revenue growth returns at the present price or fundamentals do not become worse, but the stock trades lower into the high-sixty dollar range.\\n\\nNike Price to Sales and P/E since 2000 (Seeking Alpha)\\n\\nNike is a wonderful brand that I am confident will return to growth over time, however, investors and analysts are expecting high single digit revenue growth, while the company is guiding for mid-single digit revenue decline. Until this is resolved, I expect the stock to frustrate bulls for some time.\",\n",

      "            \"body\": \"Boeing to get 'sweetheart deal' - victims' lawyer\\n\\n2 days ago By Jo\\u00e3o da Silva , Business reporter Share\\n\\nGetty Images A lawyer representing families of victims of two fatal Boeing 737 Max crashes says they \\\"strenuously object to this plea deal\\\"\\n\\nA lawyer representing victims of two fatal Boeing 737 Max crashes has told the BBC that the US government is preparing to offer the plane maker a \\\"sweetheart plea deal\\\". Paul Cassell, who says he got the information \\\"directly from the Justice Department\\\", added that the deal includes a small fine, three years of probation and independent safety audits. Boeing did not immediately reply to the BBC's request for comment, while the Justice Department (DoJ) declined to provide a statement. It comes as Boeing announced it had reached a deal to buy the aerospace supplier Spirit AeroSystems - a move it said would improve quality and safety. Spirit made the fuselage that suffered a mid-flight blowout on an Alaska Airlines 737 Max 9 jet in January, sparking widespread concern about standards at Boeing.\\n\\n'Families will object to this deal'\\n\\nLast month, US prosecutors recommended that the DoJ bring criminal charges against the plane maker. That was after the DoJ said Boeing had violated a 2021 settlement related to the crashes which killed 346 people. \\\"The memory of 346 innocents killed by Boeing demands more justice than this,\\\" said Mr Cassell, adding that the \\\"families will strenuously object to this plea deal\\\". The plane crashes - both involving Boeing's 737 Max aircraft - occurred within six months of each other. The crash involving Indonesia's Lion Air occurred in October 2018, followed by an Ethiopian Airlines flight in March 2019. Both crashes were linked to faulty flight control systems. A letter sent last month by Mr Cassell to the DoJ revealed that the families had been seeking prosecutions of Boeing's top executives at the time of the crashes and a fine of $24.8bn (\\u00a319.6bn) for \\\"the deadliest corporate crime in US history\\\". The Justice Department has until 7 July to decide whether to revive a criminal charge of fraud brought against Boeing in 2021. That charge has lain dormant since the company acknowledged in a settlement that it had misled air-safety regulators about aspects of the 737 Max, and promised to create a new compliance system to detect and prevent further fraud. Under the deal reached in 2021, Boeing said it would pay a $2.5bn settlement and prosecutors agreed to ask the court to drop a criminal charge after three years if the company abided by certain stipulations set out in the deferred prosecution agreement. But in May, the DoJ said Boeing was in breach of the deal, stating that it had failed to \\\"design, implement, and enforce a compliance and ethics program to prevent and detect violations of the US fraud laws throughout its operations\\\".\",\n",

      "            \"body\": \"Eli Lilly & Co.\\u2019s Alzheimer\\u2019s treatment was cleared in the US as the second drug to slow progression of the mind-robbing disease that afflicts 6 million Americans.\\n\\nIt\\u2019s a big win for Lilly and its investors, who have been eagerly anticipating the drug since it showed promise in clinical trials more than three years ago. Called Kisunla, the medicine endured a number of regulatory delays on the road to approval. It will compete with Eisai Co.\\u2019s Leqembi, which has been available for sale in the US since early 2023.\\n\\n\\n\\nShares of Indianapolis-based Lilly closed down 0.8% Tuesday in New York. The stock had surged more than 50% so far this year before today amid rapid growth of weight-loss and diabetes sales. Shares of Eisai partner Biogen Inc. fell 1.3%\\n\\n\\n\\nThe Alzheimer\\u2019s drug will cost $32,000 in the first year of treatment, Lilly said. That\\u2019s slightly more than the $26,500 annual price for Leqembi for a person of average size. But doctors can stop the treatment if brain plaques \\u2014 the toxic material that the drug removes \\u2014 fall to minimal levels, which they did in many people in trials after about a year.\\n\\nLower costs\\n\\nThat means that the total out-of-pocket treatment cost of the drug could sometimes be less than other amyloid drugs, Lilly said. In Leqembi\\u2019s main approval trial, patients were treated for a full 18 months.\\n\\nThe Eisai and Lilly products are both infusions that remove toxic amyloid from the brains of Alzheimer\\u2019s patients. They only modestly slow the disease and are approved only for people with early-stage Alzheimer\\u2019s, a minority of the total patient population with the disease. Side effects of both include brain swelling and brain bleeding.\\n\\nBrain swelling or bleeding occurred in 36% of patients on Lilly\\u2019s drug in the company\\u2019s main study, and produced symptoms in 6% of them, according to the drug\\u2019s label. Regular scans are required to monitor for these effects. Lilly\\u2019s drug has a potential convenience advantage since it\\u2019s infused every four weeks, compared with every two for Leqembi.\\n\\nLess frequent dosing and the potential to stop treatment are \\u201ca really big deal,\\u201d Howard Fillit, co-founder of the Alzheimer\\u2019s Drug Discovery Foundation, said in an interview before the approval.\\n\\nSeries of delays\\n\\nLilly faced a series of delays bringing Kisunla to the market. In early 2023, the FDA refused to give the drug accelerated approval based on early trial results, telling the company it wanted to wait for a late-stage trial. When Lilly submitted that data, the FDA needed more time to review it. Then earlier this year, the agency decided late in the review process to convene a day-long hearing to review the drug\\u2019s safety and efficacy.\\n\\nA panel of outside advisers to the FDA voted unanimously in favor of the drug on June 10.\\n\\n\\u201cThere\\u2019s a lot of emotion in the hallways today,\\u201d Anne White, president of Lilly Neuroscience, said in an interview before the approval. \\u201cWe have portraits up on our walls of family members to remind us why we\\u2019re doing what we\\u2019re doing.\\u201d\\n\\n\\n\\nOnce considered integral to Lilly\\u2019s future, Alzheimer\\u2019s has been overshadowed by the company\\u2019s GLP-1 medicines that aid in weight loss, a market expected to reach $130 billion a year by the end of the decade, according to analysts at Goldman Sachs.\\n\\n\\n\\nSales of Alzheimer\\u2019s drugs are also expected to grow significantly.

      "            \"body\": \"Energy prices fall but relief may be temporary\\n\\n2 days ago By Kevin Peachey , Cost of living correspondent Share\\n\\nGetty Images\\n\\nA drop in domestic gas and electricity prices has now taken effect, but costs are expected to rise again in October. Regulator Ofgem's new price cap for England, Wales and Scotland came into force on Monday, meaning a typical household's energy bill will fall by \\u00a3122 a year. That brings down the bill for a household using a typical amount of gas and electricity to \\u00a31,568 a year, the lowest for two years. But forecasters expect it to rise again in the run-up to winter, more than reversing the latest drop.\\n\\nLeading consultancy Cornwall Insight predicts that a typical household's annual bill will be back up to \\u00a31,723 in October, a \\u00a3155, or 10%, increase from now. \\\"Modest falls in summer look set to be wiped out by bigger rises in autumn when people will need to put the heating back on,\\\" said Adam Scorer, chief executive of charity National Energy Action. \\\"The cost of energy remains an unaffordable luxury that many of the poorest simply cannot afford.\\\" Although the price cap is changed every three months, it is illustrated by Ofgem in terms of an annual bill for a household using a typical amount of gas and electricity. People in larger properties will tend to pay more overall owing to higher energy usage, and those in smaller properties will pay less.\\n\\nThat is because the cap, set by Ofgem, limits the maximum price that can be charged for each unit of gas and electricity - not the total bill. It affects the gas and electricity bills of 28 million households, but does not impact customers in Northern Ireland, where the sector is regulated differently but where prices are also falling.\\n\\nEnergy bills are considerably lower than the peak after Russia's invasion of Ukraine, when the government stepped in to limit bill rises. That has fed through to falls in the general rate of rising prices, known as inflation. However, a typical household's energy bill remains about \\u00a3400 higher than three years ago, prompting debate over the issue during the election campaign.\\n\\nIn addition, households have built up a collective debt to suppliers of about \\u00a33bn owing, primarily, to the pressure from high prices. Those on prepayment meters, who tend to top up meters during the colder, darker months and are often under more financial pressure, will see a less immediate impact of a drop in prices in the summer. The vast majority of households pay by direct debit, and their payments are smoothed out over the year. They should have been contacted by their supplier about the latest price changes. Experts say it is a good idea to take a meter reading now, to ensure billpayers are charged at the correct rate. Ofgem is reviewing the way the price cap is calculated, including sifting through a host of responses to a consultation on standing charges.\\n\\nLatest changes in detail\\n\\nThe new prices that took effect for July to the end of September mean: Gas prices are now capped at 5.48p per kilowatt hour (kWh), and electricity at 22.36p per kWh\\n\\nA typical household uses 2,700 kWh of electricity a year, and 11,500 kWh of gas\\n\\nHouseholds on pre-payment meters pay slightly less than those on direct debit, with a typical bill of \\u00a31,522\\n\\nThose who pay their bills every three months by cash or cheque pay more, with a typical bill of \\u00a31,668\\n\\nStanding charges - a fixed daily charge covering the costs of connecting to a supply - are unchanged at 60p a day for electricity and 31p a day for gas, although they vary by region\\n\\nHow to keep energy use - and bills - down\",\n",

      "            \"body\": \"Inflation in the United States is slowing again after higher readings earlier this year, Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell said Tuesday, while adding that more such evidence would be needed before the Fed would cut interest rates.\\n\\nAfter some persistently high inflation reports at the start of 2024, Powell said, the data for April and May \\u201cdo suggest we are getting back on a disinflationary path.\\u201d\\n\\nSpeaking in a panel discussion at the European Central Bank\\u2019s monetary policy conference in Sintra, Portugal, Powell said Fed officials still want to see annual price growth slow further toward their 2% target before they would feel confident of having fully defeated high inflation.\\n\\n\\u201cWe just want to understand that the levels that we\\u2019re seeing are a true reading of underlying inflation,\\u201d he added.\\n\\nPowell also acknowledged that the Fed is treading a fine line as it weighs when to cut its benchmark interest rate, which it raised 11 times from March 2022 through July 2023 to its current level of 5.3%. The rate hikes were intended to curb the worst streak of inflation in four decades by slowing borrowing and spending by consumers and businesses. Inflation did tumble from its peak in 2022 yet still remains elevated.\\n\\nIf the Fed cuts rates too soon, Powell cautioned, inflation could re-accelerate, forcing the policymakers to reverse course and impose punishing rate hikes. But if the Fed waits too long to reduce borrowing costs, it risks weakening the economy so much as to potentially cause a recession.\\n\\n\\u201cGetting the balance on monetary policy right during this critical period \\u2014 that\\u2019s really what I think about in the wee hours,\\u201d Powell said in response to a question about his top worries.\\n\\nOn Friday, the government reported that consumer prices, according to the Fed\\u2019s preferred measure, were unchanged from April to May, the mildest such reading in more than four years. And compared with a year earlier, inflation dropped to just 2.6% in May, from 2.7% in April, the government said.\\n\\nExcluding volatile food and energy costs, \\u201ccore\\u201d prices also barely rose from April to May. On a year-over-year basis, core inflation fell to 2.6% from 2.8% in April. The latest inflation figures were a sharp improvement from early this year.\\n\\nIn his appearance Tuesday, Powell said the U.S. economy and job market remain fundamentally healthy, which means the Fed can take its time in deciding when rate cuts are appropriate. Most economists think the Fed\\u2019s first rate cut will occur in September, with potentially another cut to follow by year\\u2019s end.\\n\\nThe Fed chair also said the job market is \\u201ccooling off appropriately,\\u201d which likely means that it won\\u2019t heighten inflationary pressures through rapid wage gains.\\n\\n\\u201cIt doesn\\u2019t look like it\\u2019s heating up or presenting a big problem for inflation going forward,\\u201d Powell said of the job market. \\u201cIt looks like it\\u2019s doing just what you would want it to do, which is to cool off over time.\\u201d\\n\\nPowell declined to signal any time frame for a rate cut. Investors are betting that there is nearly a 70% chance for a reduction at the Fed\\u2019s meeting in September.\\n\\nFed officials have expressed a range of views on inflation and interest-rate policy since their last meeting a little over two weeks ago.\\n\\nJohn Williams, president of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York and vice chair of the central bank\\u2019s rate-setting committee, said last week, \\u201cI am confident that we at the Fed are on a path to achieving our 2% inflation goal on a sustained basis.\\u201d\\n\\nMary Daly, president of the San Francisco Fed, cautioned last week, though, that it was \\u201chard to know if we are truly on track to sustainable price stability.\\u201d\\n\\nIn his appearance Tuesday in Portugal, Powell spoke at a panel along with Christine Lagarde, president of the European Central Bank, and Roberto Campos Neto, the head of Brazil\\u2019s central bank.\\n\\nThe ECB has already made a quarter-point cut to its key rate this year, with inflation in the 20-nation eurozone having sunk from above 10% to just 2.5%.\\n\\nIn her remarks Tuesday, though, Lagarde reiterated that the ECB is not on any \\u201cpredetermined path\\u201d and that its recent rate cut \\u201cwould be followed by further review of data.\\u201d\\n\\nSuch comments have led many analysts to conclude that the ECB\\u2019s next rate cut won\\u2019t occur until September at the earliest.\",\n",

That makes him the third-biggest Chewy shareholder, according to FactSet. Based on Friday's close, that stake is valued at more than $245 million.\\n\\nThe rally in Chewy shares lost steam Monday as traders reacted to a Securities and Exchange Commission filing that showed meme stock trader \\\"Roaring Kitty\\\" took a stake in the pet food e-commerce retailer.\\n\\nThe SEC filing also included a section that read: \\\"Check the appropriate box to designate whether you are a cat.\\\" There was an \\\"x\\\" next to a response that read: \\\"I am not a cat.\\\" This line was included in Gill's statement in a series of congressional hearings about 2021's GameStop trading mania.\\n\\nThe stock rallied more than 9% on Monday, but it quickly fell into negative territory in morning trading.

GameStop CEO Ryan Cohen was founder and the first CEO of Chewy, who was instrumental in PetSmart's takeover of Chewy in 2017 and its subsequent initial public offering in 2019.\\n\\nCohen joined the GameStop board of directors along with two other Chewy executives in January 2021, partly helping fuel the initial GameStop rally. He later took over as GameStop CEO in 2023, leading a turnaround in the brick-and-mortar video game retailer.\\n\\nIn a recent YouTube livestream, Gill said GameStop is in the second stage of a reinvention, and it has become a bet on Cohen himself, who's also been leading a pivot to e-commerce.\\n\\nThe investor was hit by a new class-action lawsuit filed Friday, alleging he engaged in securities fraud by manipulating GameStop's stock price through his online influence in May and June. The case was voluntarily dismissed on Monday.\\n\\nGill is a former marketer for Massachusetts Mutual Life Insurance.

GameStop CEO Ryan Cohen was the founder and CEO of Chewy, who was instrumental in PetSmart's takeover of Chewy in 2017 and its subsequent initial public offering in 2019.\\n\\nCohen joined the GameStop board of directors along with two other Chewy executives in January 2021, partly helping fuel the initial GameStop rally. He later took over as GameStop CEO in 2023, leading a turnaround in the brick-and-mortar video game retailer.\\n\\nShares in pet retailers such as Chewy and Petco saw big spikes during the pandemic when stuck-at-home consumers adopted cats and dogs in droves. With the adoptions came purchases of needed accessories such as new beds and leashes for their furry family members.\\n\\nBut as the pandemic ended and people began venturing outside again, adoption numbers slowed and consumers had less need for discretionary pet items such as toys and cages, which carry higher profit margins than pet food.\\n\\nOver the past year or so, Chewy and Petco have seen consistently strong pet food sales, but revenue for higher margin categories has fallen.\\n\\nGill is a former marketer for Massachusetts Mutual Life Insurance. He came into the limelight after successfully encouraging retail investors to buy GameStop shares and call options in 2021 to squeeze out short-selling hedge funds. The mania in 2021 led to a series of congressional hearings featuring Gill in brokers' practices and the \\\"gamification\\\" of retail trading.\",\n",

Shares of the all-electric vehicle startup fell by about 2% to 6% for much of the event, eating into some of its 23% gain in shares the day before on news of an up to $5 billion investment by Volkswagen Group . Rivian's stock closed Thursday down 1.8% to $14.47 per share, off by roughly 39% year to date amid investor concerns regarding cash burn and a slowdown in EV sales. Rivian on Thursday reconfirmed its 2024 guidance that included production of 57,000 vehicles and a path to positive gross profit during the fourth quarter, including regulatory credits. It also outlined longer-term growths, such as plans to achieve positive adjusted earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization in 2027. \\\"Everything that you're hearing from us, around our product, around how we're running the business, around how we're driving toward profitability, my hope is that you're seeing really an extreme sense of urgency,\\\" Rivian CEO RJ Scaringe said during the event. \\\"We're very, very fast driving towards the improvements necessary to get to positive free cash flow and, before that, positive margins this year.\\\"\\n\\nStock Chart Icon Stock chart icon Rivian's stock performance\\n\\nRivian also outlined long-term financial targets of a roughly 25% gross margin, 10% free cash flow and adjusted profit margin in the \\\"high teens.\\\" The company did not release a time frame for these targets. Scaringe spent much of his time during the roughly four-hour presentation discussing efficiencies in products and manufacturing, which he said are expected to lead to 20% material cost reductions in its current vehicles, followed by 45% targeted reductions in its upcoming \\\"R2\\\" vehicles, which are projected to begin production in early 2026. The reductions range from physical savings, such as a 54% decrease in design costs of its R2 vehicles compared with current models, to lower costs on more complex systems such as battery packs and electrical hardware. For example, the company is using 10 fewer in-house electronic control units, or ECUs, in its recently redesigned R1 vehicles, allowing it to remove 1.6 miles in wiring harness length and 44 pounds out of the vehicle. Rivian's software expertise is at the center of VW's plans to invest $5 billion in the automaker by 2026, including an anticipated joint venture between the companies to create electrical architecture and software technology. Volkswagen is expected to use Rivian's electrical architecture and software stack for vehicles beginning in the second half of the decade, Scaringe said during the investment announcement. He said the joint venture does not include anything with battery technologies, vehicle propulsion platforms, high voltage systems or autonomy and electrical hardware.\\n\\nA provided image of Oliver Blume, CEO of Volkswagen Group and RJ Scaringe, founder and CEO of Rivian, as the companies announce joint venture plans on June 25, 2024.

The average price of a UK home was \\u00a3266,064 in June, Nationwide said.\\n\\nHouse prices in the UK fell last year as households came under pressure from 14 consecutive interest rate rises from the Bank of England, but they remain at historically high levels relative to earnings. Prices returned to growth earlier this year, but activity has been constrained by persistently higher borrowing costs and prices remaining unaffordable for many households.\\n\\nRobert Gardner, the Nationwide chief economist, said mortgage rates were still well above the record lows of 2021 and that rising costs had outstripped the benefit from stronger levels of average pay growth in recent months.\\n\\n\\u201cAs a result, housing affordability is still stretched. Today, a borrower earning the average UK income buying a typical first-time buyer property with a 20% deposit would have a monthly mortgage payment equivalent to 37% of take-home pay \\u2013 well above the long run average of 30%,\\u201d he said.\\n\\nSeparate figures from the Bank of England revealed a slowdown in housing market activity in May as people borrowed \\u00a31.2bn of mortgage debt, down from \\u00a32.2bn in April. Net mortgage approvals for house purchases also fell slightly from 60,800 in April to 60,000 in May.\\n\\nOfficial figures show average annual wage growth in the three months to April was 6%, above the rate of inflation, which fell back to the Bank\\u2019s target of 2% in May after reaching a peak of 11% in October 2022, the highest level in four decades.\\n\\nskip past newsletter promotion Sign up to Business Today Free daily newsletter Get set for the working day \\u2013 we'll point you to all the business news and analysis you need every morning Enter your email address Sign up Privacy Notice: Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

      "            \"body\": \"High mortgage rates pricing out buyers, says Nationwide\\n\\n2 days ago By Nick Edser , Business reporter, BBC News Share\\n\\nGetty Images\\n\\nHigh mortgage rates mean affordability is still \\\"stretched\\\" for many home buyers, according to the Nationwide. The building society said that while earnings had been rising faster than house prices in recent years, this had not been enough to offset the impact of more expensive mortgages. Its comments came as it said house price growth had been \\\"broadly stable\\\" in June, with prices up 0.2% from the previous month. The average house price is now \\u00a3266,064, the lender said.\\n\\nPrices were up 1.5% from a year earlier, but Nationwide said activity in the housing market had been \\\"broadly flat\\\" over the past 12 months, with transactions down by about 15% compared with 2019. The lender said the market was still being affected by the increase in mortgage rates, which started climbing after the Bank of England began to raise its key interest rate in late 2021. Robert Gardner, Nationwide's chief economist, said that mortgage rates are \\\"still well above the record lows prevailing in 2021 in the wake of the pandemic\\\". \\\"For example, the interest rate on a five-year fixed rate mortgage for a borrower with a 25% deposit was 1.3% in late 2021, but in recent months this has been nearer to 4.7%. \\\"As a result, housing affordability is still stretched.\\\" Nationwide's figures are based on the building society's own mortgage lending, which does not include buyers who purchase homes with cash, or buy-to-let deals. Cash buyers account for about a third of housing sales. The impact of higher borrowing costs can be seen in the fact that transactions involving a mortgage are down by nearly 25% over the past year, Nationwide said. Meanwhile the number of cash transactions for properties is about 5% higher than pre-pandemic levels. Across the UK, Northern Ireland saw the biggest price increases, up 4.1% from a year earlier. Wales and Scotland both saw a 1.4% annual rise. Prices in England climbed by 0.6%, with northern regions seeing bigger increases in general than the south.\\n\\nDespite some major lenders cutting their mortgage rates last week, home loan costs remain far higher than pre-pandemic levels. According to financial information service Moneyfacts, the average rate on a two-year fixed mortgage deal stands at 5.95%, while for a five-year deal the average is 5.53%. The focus is now on the Bank of England's Monetary Policy Committee (MPC), which sets interest rates, to see if it decides to cut at its next meeting on 1 August. June's MPC meeting saw a change in tone from policymakers, with suggestions that the Bank could vote for a rate cut next month. \\\"Buyers may find their mojo again when we get a rate cut from the Bank of England,\\\" said Sarah Coles, head of personal finance at Hargreaves Lansdown. \\\"This could come as early as August, although sticky services inflation and higher wages could mean we need to wait until the autumn. \\\"Either way, we\\u2019re not expecting massive overnight drops in mortgage rates, so the reaction is more likely to be a muted upturn in sentiment than an overwhelming wave of optimism.\\\"\\n\\nLast week, the Bank said that about three million households are set to see their mortgage payments rise in the next two years. These are homeowners who arranged mortgage deals before the Bank started to lift rates in 2021. These deals are now expiring, and the Bank said the majority will finish before the end of 2026. For the typical household looking for a new deal, monthly mortgage repayments are forecast to increase by about \\u00a3180, or about 28%, the Bank said. However, for around 400,000 households, monthly payments could jump by 50% or more. Bank of England figures released on Monday showed a small fall in the number of mortgages approved in May, down to 60,000 from 60,800 in April. However, the data also showed the amount borrowed through mortgages dropped sharply to \\u00a31.2bn in May, from \\u00a32.2bn the month before, although this does not include those remortgaging with the same lender.\\n\\nWays to make your mortgage more affordable\",\n",

Daniel Acker | Bloomberg | Getty Images\\n\\nBoeing said Monday that it will buy back its struggling fuselage maker Spirit AeroSystems in an all-stock deal that the plane maker has said will improve safety and quality control. It said it agreed to pay $37.25 a share in Boeing stock for Spirit, giving the plane supplier an equity value of $4.7 billion. Including Spirit's debt the deal has a transaction value of $8.3 billion Boeing said. Spirit's shares closed Friday at $32.87 a share, a market capitalization of about $3.8 billion. Boeing in March disclosed it was in talks to acquire the Wichita, Kansas-based company, weeks after a fuselage panel blew out midair from a nearly new Boeing 737 Max 9 on an Alaska Airlines flight, sparking a fresh crisis for Boeing. Spirit makes the fuselages for the 737 and other parts, including sections of Boeing's 787 Dreamliners. In 2005, Boeing spun off operations in Kansas and Oklahoma that became the present-day Spirit AeroSystems. Boeing accounted for about 70% of Spirit's revenue last year, while roughly a quarter came from making parts for Boeing's main rival, Airbus, according to a securities filing. Boeing CEO Dave Calhoun, who has said he will step down at the end of the year, on Monday said bringing Spirit in-house will \\\"fully align\\\" the companies' production systems and workforces.\\n\\nwatch now\\n\\n\\\"Among the many actions we're taking as a company, this is one of the most significant in demonstrating our unwavering commitment to strengthen quality and make certain that Boeing is the company the world needs it to be,\\\" Calhoun said in a message to employees. He said he expects the deal to close mid-2025, subject to approval by regulators, Spirit shareholders and the sale of Spirit's operations dedicated to Airbus planes. Spirit's CEO, Pat Shanahan, is considered a possible successor for Calhoun. Airbus, meanwhile, said Monday it has reached an agreement with Spirit so that the European aircraft manufacturer is compensated $559 million by Spirit to acquire its manufacturing lines dedicated to Airbus planes. Those include operations in Belfast, Northern Ireland, where the wings and mid-fuselage of the A220 are produced, A220 pylons in Wichita and A350 fuselage sections in North Carolina. Airbus will pay $1 for the assets.\\n\\nMounting pressure\",\n",

      "            \"body\": \"When Steve Ballmer joined Microsoft he didn\\u2019t get a single company share. But now, his skyrocketing Microsoft holdings have made him richer than the company\\u2019s founder.\\n\\nThe 68-year-old former Microsoft CEO squeaked by his onetime boss Bill Gates to become the sixth richest person in the world on Monday with a net worth of $157 billion. He is now richer than many well-known tech entrepreneurs including Google cofounder Sergey Brin, Oracle founder Larry Ellison, and Dell Technologies CEO Michael Dell.\\n\\nIt\\u2019s also the first time that Ballmer\\u2019s net worth has surpassed that of Gates, and one of the few times in history an employee has come to be richer than a company\\u2019s founder. Ballmer is the only person with a net worth of $100 billion or more who made their money as an employee rather than a founder, as Fortune previously reported.\\n\\nBallmer\\u2019s net worth was boosted by a rally in Microsoft\\u2019s shares, which closed at an all-time high on Tuesday and have surged 22% since January. Shares of the company represent about 90% of his net worth, according to the Bloomberg Billionaires Index, and Microsoft has been one of the biggest beneficiaries of the AI boom fueling markets, thanks to its $10 billion investment in OpenAI.\\n\\nIn 2014, Ballmer left Microsoft with about a 4% stake worth $22.5 billion, according to Forbes. At the time, he said that he was holding on to his shares for the long term, Forbes reported.\\n\\n\\u201cI\\u2019d like to own Microsoft shares until I either give something to charity or I die,\\u201d he told the outlet.\\n\\nMeanwhile, Gates has diversified his portfolio over the years away from the company he founded, with half of his holdings now managed through private investment firm Cascade Investment. He has a $21 billion stake in waste management company Republic Services through Cascade, Bloomberg reported.\\n\\nGiving away money\\n\\nGates\\u2019 major philanthropic donations also factor in. As of 2023, Gates and his ex-wife Melinda French Gates had donated $59.5 billion to the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation, turning it into the one of the world\\u2019s largest charitable foundations. In 2010, Gates also cocreated the Giving Pledge with French Gates and investor Warren Buffett, and has promised to give away most of his wealth during his lifetime.\\n\\nAlthough Steve Ballmer\\u2019s holdings have made him one of the richest men in the world, when he joined as the company\\u2019s 30th employee in 1980, he didn\\u2019t get a single share. After dropping out of Stanford Business School, he served as a quasi\\u2013personal assistant to Bill Gates with the unimpressive title \\u201cbusiness manager,\\u201d Forbes reported.\\n\\nYet, because Microsoft was looking to grow rapidly at the time, Gates and his cofounder, Paul Allen, agreed to give Ballmer 10% of the profit growth he generated on top of his $50,000 yearly salary.\\n\\nThat deal turned out to be key to Ballmer\\u2019s future wealth. Soon, Microsoft was growing so fast that Ballmer\\u2019s 10% cut no longer made sense financially for the company. When Microsoft reorganized as a corporation, Ballmer negotiated an 8% slice for himself in exchange for giving up his profit-sharing deal, while Gates and Allen kept 84% and another 8% was designated for other employees, Forbes reported. Although Allen was opposed to giving Ballmer such a large stake, Gates stepped in and said Ballmer\\u2019s 8% cut could be funded by a drawdown of his own holdings, according to Forbes.\\n\\nWhile at the time Gates put his own money on the line for Ballmer, the two have since drifted apart.\\n\\n\\u201cMicrosoft was kind of the thing that really bound us,\\u201d Ballmer told Bloomberg Television in 2016. \\u201cWe started off as friends, but then really got quite enmeshed around Microsoft. Since I\\u2019ve gone, we really have drifted a little bit.\\u201d\",\n",

The company, through its partnership with OpenAI, has been one of the biggest beneficiaries of the artificial intelligence rally that has powered the US stock market higher.\\n\\nMore than 90% of Ballmer\\u2019s $157.2 billion net worth is in Microsoft shares, according to the Bloomberg Billionaires Index. Gates, meanwhile, has diversified his $156.7 billion fortune: About half his wealth is held through Cascade Investment, which was created with the proceeds of Microsoft stock sales and dividends. He also owns a $21 billion stake in waste-management company Republic Services Inc. through Cascade.\\n\\nGates, 68, has been slowly reducing his fortune through philanthropy. Along with his ex-wife Melinda French Gates and his friend Warren Buffett, Gates has funneled billions of dollars of his personal money to build up the $75 billion Gates Foundation, one of the biggest charitable organizations in the world.\\n\\nSince they started the foundation more than two decades ago, Gates and his former wife have given almost $60 billion from their personal fortunes. French Gates recently stepped down as co-chair of the foundation and received $12.5 billion to use for her own charitable purposes.\\n\\nIn 2010, Gates, French Gates and Buffett also founded the Giving Pledge, an organization that encourages the world\\u2019s richest people to give away the majority of their fortunes in their lifetimes or their wills. Ballmer, 68, who has not signed the Giving Pledge, has his own philanthropic work but nowhere on the scale of Gates.\\n\\nGates founded Microsoft with his friend Paul Allen in 1975 and led it until 2000, when Ballmer \\u2014 one of the company\\u2019s earliest employees \\u2014 replaced him as CEO. Ballmer retired in 2014 and became Microsoft\\u2019s largest shareholder that same year. He bought the NBA\\u2019s Los Angeles Clippers for $2 billion in 2014, an investment that is estimated to be worth $4.6 billion today.\\n\\n--With assistance from Sophie Alexander and Jack Witzig.\\n\\nStory continues\\n\\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek\\n\\n\\u00a92024 Bloomberg L.P.\",\n",
