        "body": "Editor\u2019s Note: Delving into the archives of pop culture history, \u201cRemember When?\u201d is a new series offering a nostalgic look at the celebrity outfits that defined their eras.\n\nCNN \u2014\n\nRemember when Kate Moss wore wellies (that\u2019s rain boots for those outside the UK) to Glastonbury?\n\nAs the historic festival once again returns to Worthy Farm, we look back at one of its most memorable fashion moments. After all, no British summer would be complete without copious amounts of mud.\n\nAnd no one has conquered it quite like Moss.\n\nSome 19 years ago, Britain\u2019s best-known supermodel broke fashion\u2019s proverbial fourth wall and joined the mortals in their muddy squalor. Sure, she\u2019d probably spent the weekend glamping in the festival\u2019s VIP zone. But a filthy field is England\u2019s great leveler \u2013 and during those brief, well-photographed walks through the Glastonbury grounds, cigarette in hand, she was just like us.\n\nUntil, that is, her choice of practical footwear transformed festival fashion and helped save a heritage boot maker from the brink of obsolescence.\n\nIt was the summer of 2005 and Moss was near the height of her powers. Media interest in her festival whereabouts was amplified by a fixation with her then-nascent dalliance with Pete Doherty. But while The Libertines\u2019 frontman certainly looked more at home in the conditions, it was Moss who grabbed the limelight.\n\nPete Doherty and Kate Moss are seen at the Glastonbury Music Festival 2005. MJ Kim/Getty Images\n\nMatching a pair of classic black Hunter rain boots with a waistcoat, short shorts and studded belt (and later a glittering tunic), the model was a picture of understated glamor. Below the knee her look was interchangeable with that of a Somerset pig farmer. But above it, she could just have easily emerged from a Chelsea mansion to a well-placed paparazzi ambush.\n\nThe images quickly went viral (or as viral as they could in the pre-social media age). The bastion of mid-1990s so-called \u201cheroin chic\u201d had become the face of its slightly older, more respectable cousin: mid-2000s festival chic.\n\nIn the process, wellies secured their place in the popular imagination. No longer the preserve of agriculture, they had become a rubbery status symbol best matched with trilby hats, cravats and other questionable noughties accessories. This once-practical boot had morphed into bourgeois badge of honor indicating that the wearer was prepared to \u201crough it\u201d and still look fabulous (the drug-afflicted rockstar boyfriend remained an optional part of the look).\n\nSuddenly, festival wear became its own category of clothing, something far greater than an amalgam of items you didn\u2019t mind ruining. But an even more profound transformation was also taking place \u2013 that of the then-struggling Hunter Boot Limited.\n\nThe Scottish brand\u2019s true heyday may have been during the World Wars, when it produced huge quantities of waterproof boots for the front lines. But never before in the company\u2019s then 149-year history had its sensible footwear been so desirable. While one shouldn\u2019t overstate the power of the Moss effect (her endorsement couldn\u2019t save the boot maker from entering administration in 2006), it helped set in motion a remarkable turnaround in the company\u2019s fortunes.\n\nBy 2007, the firm was under new ownership and reporting an 85% increase in year-on-year sales. It has since become a bona fide festival fixture, producing rainwear, outerwear and boots in all manner of colors and styles.\n\nOnce prized for keeping gangrene at bay in the trenches, Hunter has completed the ultimate 21st-century transformation to become the rainy-day boot de jour for celebrities from Rita Ora to Rihanna, Cara Delevingne to Alexa Chung.\n\nAnd to think that all Kate wanted was a pair of snug, dry feet.",

        "body": "Natasha Craft, a 25-year-old FedEx driver from Mishawaka, Indiana. She has been locked out of her Yotta banking account since May 11. Courtesy: Natasha Craft\n\nWhen Natasha Craft first got a Yotta banking account in 2021, she loved using it so much she told her friends to sign up. The app made saving money fun and easy, and Craft, a now 25-year-old FedEx driver from Mishawaka, Indiana, was busy getting her financial life in order and planning a wedding. Craft had her wages deposited directly into a Yotta account and used the startup's debit card to pay for all her expenses. The app \u2014 which gamifies personal finance with weekly sweepstakes and other flashy features \u2014 even occasionally covered some of her transactions. \"There were times I would go buy something and get that purchase for free,\" Craft told CNBC. Today, her entire life savings \u2014 $7,006 \u2014 is locked up in a complicated dispute playing out in bankruptcy court, online forums like Reddit and regulatory channels. And Yotta, an array of other startups and their banks have been caught in a moment of reckoning for the fintech industry. For customers, fintech promised the best of both worlds: The innovation, ease of use and fun of the newest apps combined with the safety of government-backed accounts held at real banks. The startups prominently displayed protections afforded by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp., lending credibility to their novel offerings. After all, since its 1934 inception, no depositor \"has ever lost a penny of FDIC-insured deposits,\" according to the agency's website. But the widening fallout over the collapse of a fintech middleman called Synapse has revealed that promise of safety as a mirage. Starting May 11, more than 100,000 Americans with $265 million in deposits were locked out of their accounts. Roughly 85,000 of those customers were at Yotta alone, according to the startup's co-founder, Adam Moelis. CNBC reached out to fintech customers whose lives have been upended by the Synapse debacle. They come from all walks and stages of life, from Craft, the Indiana FedEx driver; to the owner of a chain of preschools in Oakland, California; a talent analyst for Disney living in New York City; and a computer engineer in Santa Barbara, California. A high school teacher in Maryland. A parent in Bristol, Connecticut, who opened an account for his daughter. A social worker in Seattle saving up for dental work after Adderall abuse ruined her teeth.\n\n'A reckoning underway'\n\nSince Yotta, like most popular fintech apps, wasn't itself a bank, it relied on partner institutions including Tennessee-based Evolve Bank & Trust to offer checking accounts and debit cards. In between Yotta and Evolve was a crucial middleman, Synapse, keeping track of balances and monitoring fraud. Founded in 2014 by a first-time entrepreneur named Sankaet Pathak, Synapse was a player in the \"banking-as-a-service\" segment alongside companies like Unit and Synctera. Synapse helped customer-facing startups like Yotta quickly access the rails of the regulated banking industry. It had contracts with 100 fintech companies and 10 million end users, according to an April court filing. Until recently, the BaaS model was a growth engine that seemed to benefit everybody. Instead of spending years and millions of dollars trying to acquire or become banks, startups got quick access to essential services they needed to offer. The small banks that catered to them got a source of deposits in a time dominated by giants like JPMorgan Chase . But in May, Synapse, in the throes of bankruptcy, turned off a critical system that Yotta's bank used to process transactions. In doing so, it threw thousands of Americans into financial limbo, and a growing segment of the fintech industry into turmoil. \"There is a reckoning underway that involves questions about the banking-as-a-service model,\" said Michele Alt, a former lawyer for the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency and a current partner at consulting firm Klaros Group. She believes the Synapse failure will prove to be an \"aberration,\" she added. The most popular finance apps in the country, including Block's Cash App, PayPal and Chime, partner with banks instead of owning them. They account for 60% of all new fintech account openings, according to data provider Curinos. Block and PayPal are publicly traded; Chime is expected to launch an IPO next year. Block, PayPal and Chime didn't provide comment for this article.\n\n'Deal directly with a bank'\n\nWhile industry experts say those firms have far more robust ledgering and daily reconciliation abilities than Synapse, they may still be riskier than direct bank relationships, especially for those relying on them as a primary account. \"If it's your spending money, you need to be dealing directly with a bank,\" Scott Sanborn, CEO of LendingClub , told CNBC. \"Otherwise, how do you, as a consumer, know if the conditions are met to get FDIC coverage?\" Sanborn knows both sides of the fintech divide: LendingClub started as a fintech lender that partnered with banks until it bought Boston-based Radius in early 2020 for $185 million, eventually becoming a fully regulated bank.\n\nScott Sanborn, LendingClub CEO Getty Images\n\nSanborn said acquiring Radius Bank opened his eyes to the risks of the \"banking-as-a-service\" space. Regulators focus not on Synapse and other middlemen, but on the banks they partner with, expecting them to monitor risks and prevent fraud and money laundering, he said. But many of the tiny banks running BaaS businesses like Radius simply don't have the personnel or resources to do the job properly, Sanborn said. He shuttered most of the lender's fintech business as soon as he could, he says. \"We are one of those people who said, 'Something bad is going to happen,'\" Sanborn said. A spokeswoman for the Financial Technology Association, a Washington, D.C.-based trade group representing large players including Block, PayPal and Chime, said in a statement that it is \"inaccurate to claim that banks are the only trusted actors in financial services.\" \"Consumers and small businesses trust fintech companies to better meet their needs and provide more accessible, affordable, and secure services than incumbent providers,\" the spokeswoman said. \"Established fintech companies are well-regulated and work with partner banks to build strong compliance programs that protect consumer funds,\" she said. Furthermore, regulators ought to take a \"risk-based approach\" to supervising fintech-bank partnerships, she added. The implications of the Synapse disaster may be far-reaching. Regulators have already been moving to punish the banks that provide services to fintechs, and that will undoubtedly continue. Evolve itself was reprimanded by the Federal Reserve last month for failing to properly manage its fintech partnerships.\n\nIn a post-Synapse update, the FDIC made it clear that the failure of nonbanks won't trigger FDIC insurance, and that even when fintechs partner with banks, customers may not have their deposits covered. The FDIC's exact language about whether fintech customers are eligible for coverage: \"The short answer is: it depends.\"\n\nFDIC safety net\n\nWhile their circumstances all differed vastly, each of the customers CNBC spoke to for this story had one thing in common: They thought the FDIC backing of Evolve meant that their funds were safe. \"For us, it just felt like they were a bank,\" the Oakland preschool owner said of her fintech provider, a tuition processor called Curacubby. \"You'd tell them what to bill, they bill it. They'd communicate with parents, and we get the money.\" The 62-year-old business owner, who asked CNBC to withhold her name because she didn't want to alarm employees and parents of her schools, said she's taken out loans and tapped credit lines after $236,287 in tuition was frozen in May. Now, the prospect of selling her business and retiring in a few years seems much further out. \"I'm assuming I probably won't see that money,\" she said, \"And if I do, how long is it going to take?\" When Rick Davies, a 46-year-old lead engineer for a men's clothing company that owns online brands including Taylor Stitch, signed up for an account with crypto app Juno, he says he \"distinctly remembers\" being comforted by seeing the FDIC logo of Evolve. \"It was front and center on their website,\" Davies said. \"They made it clear that it was Evolve doing the banking, which I knew as a fintech provider. The whole package seemed legit to me.\" He's now had roughly $10,000 frozen for weeks, and says he's become enraged that the FDIC hasn't helped customers yet. For Davies, the situation is even more baffling after regulators swiftly took action to seize Silicon Valley Bank last year, protecting uninsured depositors including tech investors and wealthy families in the process. His employer banked with SVB, which collapsed after clients withdrew deposits en masse, so he saw how fast action by regulators can head off distress. \"The dichotomy between the FDIC stepping in extremely quickly for San Francisco-based tech companies and their impotence in the face of this similar, more consumer-oriented situation is infuriating,\" Davies said. The key difference with SVB is that none of the banks linked with Synapse have failed, and because of that, the regulator hasn't moved to help impacted users. Consumers can be forgiven for not understanding the nuance of FDIC protection, said Alt, the former OCC lawyer. \"What consumers understood was, 'This is as safe as money in the bank,'\" Alt said. \"But the FDIC insurance isn't a pot of money to generally make people whole, it is there to make depositors of a failed bank whole.\"\n\nWaiting for their money",

        "body": "Pictured here is a stone with tungsten ore inside a mine in Germany run by Saxony Minerals and Exploration. Picture Alliance | Picture Alliance | Getty Images\n\nBEIJING \u2014 China dominates the supply chain for many of the world's critical minerals, but so far it's held off on sweeping restrictions on at least one: tungsten. The metal is nearly as hard as diamond and has a high energy density. That's made tungsten an important material in weapons, autos, electric car batteries, semiconductors and industrial cutting machines. Chipmakers such as Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company and Nvidia both use the metal. \"I don't expect any saber-rattling over tungsten,\" said Lewis Black, CEO of Canada-based Almonty Industries, which is spending at least $75 million to reopen a tungsten mine in South Korea later this year. \"If you get too belligerent about diversification, [it becomes a situation that's] biting the hand that feeds you,\" he said, adding that \"tungsten has always been a diplomatic metal.\" While the Biden administration raised tariffs on imports of tungsten in May, China this past weekend did not include the metal in new regulations for boosting its oversight of domestic rare earths production.\n\nBut China might not be too concerned, because the Chinese government ignored the new tariffs... They completely ignored it because the Chinese don't want tensions to rise. Lewis Black CEO of Almonty\n\n\"The tariffs were more of a warning shot, as Biden only put tariffs on three of the 25 strategic metals China exports,\" Black said. \"But China might not be too concerned, because the Chinese government ignored the new tariffs, unlike in the past when they restricted some exports of rare earths. They completely ignored it because the Chinese don't want tensions to rise.\" Asked last month if China would retaliate to the latest U.S. tariffs on tungsten, China's Ministry of Commerce spokesperson He Yadong didn't announce countermeasures. Instead, he called on the U.S. to remove the additional duties. Commodity price reporting and analytics company Fastmarkets pointed out earlier this year that China has reduced national production quotas for its tungsten mines due to environmental restrictions.\n\nDiversifying away from China\n\nStill, Black expects his company to benefit from growing efforts to diversify away from China. Almonty claims the forthcoming mine in South Korea has the potential to produce 50% of the world's ex-China tungsten supply. Demand for non-Chinese tungsten is already on the rise. \"We see in the U.S., in Europe, they ask their suppliers for a China-free supply chain,\" said Michael Dornhofer, founder of metals consulting firm Independent Supply Business Partner.\n\nwatch now\n\nThe U.S. REEShore Act \u2014 or Restoring Essential Energy and Security Holdings Onshore for Rare Earths Act of 2022 \u2014 prohibits the use of Chinese tungsten in military equipment starting in 2026, while the European Commission last year extended tariffs on imported Chinese tungsten carbide for another five years, Almonty Industries pointed out in a report. The House Select Committee on the Strategic Competition between the United States and the Chinese Communist Party last month announced a new working group on the U.S. critical minerals policy.\n\nSoaring tungsten prices\n\nExpectations for higher demand and limited supplies of tungsten have pushed prices to multi-year highs, although they have tapered off in the last several weeks. Dornhofer said in an interview in late May that he was also seeing Chinese buyers increasing their tungsten purchases. \"Since the beginning of this year, they are not only asking for Western concentrate, but they are buying significant volumes, paying even more than Western companies are willing to pay,\" he said. \"Definitely [going to be] a game changer.\"\n\nwatch now\n\nBack in January, U.S.-based research firm Macro Ops said: \"We're approaching an inflection point in tungsten supply. The US will quickly run out of stockpiled tungsten and flip from net seller to buyer over the next 12-18 months.\" The U.S. Bureau of Industry and Security at the Department of Commerce did not immediately respond to a CNBC request for comment on this story. Brandon Beylo, head of investment research at Macro Ops, told CNBC in an email there are only six companies in the U.S. with capacity to produce tungsten. He added that the U.S. hasn't produced tungsten domestically since 2015, meaning future U.S. supply must come from overseas. He said the firm doesn't own tungsten-related stocks, but that he's personally looking for ways to access the physical commodity. There are no futures for trading tungsten.\n\nOther tungsten players going to South Korea\n\nChina dominates over 80% of the tungsten supply chain, although local production costs are rising as the mines age, according to Argus, noting Chinese imports of the metal from North Korea, central Africa and Myanmar. \"This presents an opportunity for projects outside China,\" Mark Seddon, principal, consulting and analytics at Argus, said in a June 28 webinar. Other non-Chinese companies in the tungsten supply chain are going to South Korea. In February, IMC Endmill, an affiliate of Warren Buffett-owned IMC Group, signed an agreement with the Daegu city government for a 130 billion Korean won ($93.6 million) investment in a tungsten powder manufacturing facility, according to a local news report. IMC Group did not immediately respond to CNBC's request for comment.\n\nwatch now",

We want to be more confident that inflation is moving sustainably down toward 2% before we start the process of reducing or loosening policy,\" he added.\n\nPowell spoke at a forum that also included European Central Bank President Christine Lagarde and Brazil central bank Governor Roberto Campos Neto. The forum was presented by the ECB and the discussion was moderated by CNBC's Sara Eisen.\n\nThe comments come with markets closely watching moves from the Fed and its global counterparts as inflation shows signs of easing and some central banks, including the ECB, have slowly started rolling back interest rates.\n\nThe Commerce Department's personal consumption expenditures price index, which the Fed focuses on as its main inflation gauge, rose at a 2.6% 12-month pace in May. That level has come down steadily after being around 4% a year ago, though policymakers do not expect it to reach the Fed's 2% goal until 2026.\n\nWhile Powell said he sees progress on inflation, he's wary of moving too soon and threatening the downward path of price increases, which hit their highest pace since the early 1980s two years ago.\n\n\"We're well aware that if we go too soon, that we can undo the good work we've done,\" he said. \"If we do it too late, we could unnecessarily undermine the recovery and the expansion.\"\n\nRisks of moving too late as opposed to too soon have come into better balance this year as inflation has ebbed and the economy and labor market have stayed strong, Powell added. By contrast, the Fed spent much of the past year worried that cutting rates too soon and allowing inflation to resume its upward trek posed the greater risk.\n\nEarlier this year, markets had expected at least six Fed rate cuts of a quarter percentage point each. Market pricing has since adjusted to anticipate two reductions, one in September and another before the end of the year. However, members of the rate-setting Federal Open Market Committee at their June meeting penciled in just one.\n\nAsked if he thought the Fed might cut in September, Powell responded, \"I'm not going to be landing on any specific dates here today.\"\n\nHe also was asked about whether he was concerned about the political climate and specifically should Donald Trump, a fierce Powell critic, win the November presidential election.\n\n\"I am not focused on that at all, and that's not just a talking point. I really think that we just keep doing our jobs,\" he said.",

        "body": "Anxiety symptoms vary widely from moodiness to lashing out. Carol Yepes | Moment | Getty Images\n\nSlamming doors, throwing tantrums, unexpected crying, and one-sided conversations at the dinner table. If these are common occurrences in your household, you are probably raising a teenager. Teenagers are often perceived as entitled brats with little or no control over their emotions. And although many parents may see this as unnecessary angst or rebellion, these could be signs of the child struggling with anxiety. \"It's so overwhelming and so powerful that you're really just stuck in the storm. The anxiety has taken control over your mind and body,\" said Natasha Riard, lecturer in clinical psychology and psychology clinic manager at James Cook University Singapore. \"The person who is experiencing anxiety wants it to stop, and the parent watching it wants to stop it. But once the panic attack starts, it's like a train that has left the station, and it's only going to stop when it reaches the next one. The journey between those stations is the experience of the attack,\" Riard explained. Parents might not always know how to help their children when they are feeling anxious or are on the brink of an anxiety attack, and methods that worked in the past may no longer be useful as teenagers face new challenges, psychologists said. Here's how parents can better perceive signs of anxiety among their kids \u2014 and tips for them to help their young ones.\n\nThe signs\n\nRegardless of age, people who are feeling anxious will have a fight, flight, freeze or fawn reaction to stressful situations, according to psychologists. They told CNBC that the most common reactions are flight and freeze, where one shows signs of panic and will start crying or shaking, or even freeze up and dissociate from the matter by becoming silent and shutting off. \"When you're having a panic attack, you might really freak out about what is happening to you. You might have a shift in the way that you perceive reality and it can be a very scary experience,\" warned Eli Lebowitz, Co-Director of the Yale Child Study Center Anxiety and Mood Disorders Program. Like adults, adolescents also have a fight response when they feel anxious, which can often be misunderstood as throwing tantrums or acting out. \"Parents need to think about the meaning behind their children slamming doors and shouting. Could they be anxious about something?\" Riard said, emphasizing that this is just another expression of anxiety. Psychologists said they also noticed children having a fawn reaction where they suffer from \"high-functioning\" anxiety and manage to carry on with their daily routine despite being in poor mental health. \"Young people often avoid how they're feeling and do their best to appear that everything is okay by appearing busy in a chaotic situation. What you see on their face or behavior may not be what's going on underneath,\" Lisa Coloca, psychologist and director at Melbourne-based Bloom Psychology Group and Bloom Community highlighted. Yale's Lebowitz said that some of the signs parents should watch out for are shortness of breath, body stiffness and a change in skin tone. Although an anxiety attack may seem scary and uncontrollable, it's not dangerous and parents should not \"freak out,\" he added.\n\nTop tips to help an anxious teen",

        "title": "Trump sentencing date in hush money case postponed more than two months to Sept. 18",
        "body": "Former U.S. President Donald Trump comments as he leaves the courthouse after a jury found him guilty of all 34 felony counts in his criminal trial at New York State Supreme Court on May 30, 2024.\n\nMerchan said he will reach a decision on the matter by Sept. 6. Trump's sentencing will occur Sept. 18 at 10 a.m. ET, \u201cif such is still necessary,\u201d Merchan ruled.\n\nTrump's lawyers now have until July 10 to file a motion to set aside the hush money verdict. Prosecutors, who did not oppose Trump's bid to delay the sentencing date, must file their response by July 24.\n\nThat request came in light of Monday's bombshell Supreme Court ruling that former presidents are entitled to \u201cpresumptive immunity\u201d for all official acts they performed in office.\n\nTrump, the presumptive Republican presidential nominee, was previously set to be sentenced July 11. But Manhattan Supreme Court Judge Juan Merchan in Tuesday's order canceled that date, while granting a request by Trump's attorneys to file a motion seeking to overturn his guilty verdict.\n\nTrump's criminal sentencing, if it still happens, will now take place Sept. 18, about seven weeks before the Nov. 5 presidential election.\n\nA New York judge on Tuesday delayed Donald Trump 's sentencing date in his criminal hush money case by more than two months, following a request by the former president's attorneys to challenge his conviction.\n\nThe Supreme Court's 6-3 decision instantly threatened to undermine some of the numerous active criminal cases against Trump.\n\nThe hush money case, which will likely be the only one against Trump to head to trial before the Nov. 5 presidential election, ended on May 30 with Trump's conviction on 34 counts of falsifying business records.\n\nThe case centered on a $130,000 payment made shortly before the 2016 election to porn star Stormy Daniels, who says she had sex with Trump while he was married years earlier. Trump's former attorney Michael Cohen, who made the payment, was reimbursed by Trump after he became president.\n\nIn a letter to Merchan on Monday, Trump's attorneys asked for a July 10 deadline to submit a legal memo in support of their bid to set aside the guilty verdict.\n\nAnd \u201cbecause of the complexity of the issues presented,\u201d they added, \u201cPresident Trump does not object to an adjournment of the July 11, 2024 sentencing date in order to allow adequate time for full briefing, oral argument, and a decision.\u201d\n\nThe attorneys argued in the letter that, under the Supreme Court's latest ruling, certain evidence prosecutors introduced at trial \u201cshould never have been put before the jury\" because it pertained to official presidential acts. Their letter referenced the then-president's social media posts and public statements.\n\n\u201cThe verdicts in this case violate the presidential immunity doctrine and create grave risks of \u2018an Executive Branch that cannibalizes itself,\u2019\u201d they wrote, quoting the majority opinion from Chief Justice John Roberts.\n\n\u201cAfter further briefing on these issues beginning on July 10, 2024, it will be manifest that the trial result cannot stand,\u201d Trump's lawyers wrote.\n\nProsecutors from the Manhattan District Attorney's office, in their own letter to Merchan on Tuesday, said they believe Trump's arguments are meritless.\n\nBut \u201cwe do not oppose his request for leave to file and his putative request to adjourn sentencing pending determination of his motion,\u201d the prosecutors wrote.\n\nThe Supreme Court's ruling came as part of a separate criminal case charging Trump with illegally conspiring to overturn his loss to President Joe Biden in the 2020 election.\n\nThat case was put on ice for months while Trump and special counsel Jack Smith grappled over whether former presidents are immune from prosecution for their official acts.\n\nJudges in federal district court and the federal appellate circuit in Washington, D.C., had rejected Trump's claim of \u201cabsolute immunity\u201d for all official acts.\n\nBut the Supreme Court's six-member conservative majority vacated those decisions, ruling Monday that ex-presidents have \u201cat least presumptive immunity from prosecution\u201d for those acts.\n\nThat immunity holds \u201cunless the Government can show that applying a criminal prohibition to that act would pose no \u2018dangers of intrusion on the authority and functions of the Executive Branch,\u2019\u201d Roberts wrote.\n\nThe majority also appeared to limit the evidence that can be used in a criminal prosecution of a former president, even if they are only accused of unofficial conduct.\n\nUsing evidence of official conduct in such a prosecution would defeat the intended effect of the president's immunity, Roberts wrote. Doing so \u201cwould thereby heighten the prospect that the President's official decisionmaking will be distorted.\u201d\n\nThe decision drew a vehement response from the court's three liberal justices, including Sonia Sotomayor, who expressed \u201cfear for our democracy\u201d in a scathing dissent.",

The FDA rejected the drug's approval last year due to insufficient data, then surprisingly delayed it again in March. Last month, an advisory panel to the agency recommended the treatment for full approval, saying the benefits outweigh its risks.",

        "body": "We're raising our price targets on the Investing Club's only \"own it, don't trade it\" stocks \u2014 Nvidia and Apple \u2014 two mega-cap tech names that have been winners this year with more room to run. Nvidia We're boosting our Nvidia price target to $150 per share from $120 \u2014 representing an increase of more than 20% from Monday's close. The artificial intelligence giant, which briefly became the most valuable U.S. company a couple of weeks ago, has come off the boil a bit recently. On Tuesday, it was just hanging onto a $3 trillion market cap. For investors with no Nvidia exposure, the stock on Tuesday was near one of three possible buy levels we identified last week . It dipped briefly below intraday Monday. We're considering an upgrade from our wait-for-a-pullback 2 rating given the stock's roughly 12% decline from last month's all-time intraday high of nearly $141 to Monday's close. However, in 2024 alone, the stock is up over 145% \u2014 far and away our best performer this year. But given that run, we're reiterating our wait-for-a-pullback 2 rating for now. NVDA 5Y mountain Nvidia 5 years As strong as Nvidia shares have been since their October 2022 closing low of $11.23 each \u2013 an over 1,000% surge since then \u2013 we continue to see further strength ahead. The catalysts include sustained demand for the company's AI hardware solutions along with the upside potential from its growing services offerings. After soaring on earnings in May and gaining ground since last month's 10-for-1 stock split, the primary concern behind the stock's recent decline has been whether Nvidia's clients might pause hardware spending as the chipmaker transitions from its Hopper suite to the new Blackwell architecture. That worry is misplaced because industry checks continue to indicate that won't be the case. The need for accelerated computing is too great and the vast majority of the world's data centers were not built from the ground up with AI workloads in mind. As a result, we believe companies big and small are in the early stages of a massive investment cycle. Nvidia's services revenue is not yet material to earnings, but we continue to see several avenues for growth. Nvidia has solutions for many key industries including health care and autonomous vehicles. We believe the addressable markets for those verticals are large and only getting larger. Health care revenue at Nvidia has already exceeded a $1 billion run rate. The company is also proving to be a key partner for many of the world's auto industry OEMs (original equipment manufacturers). The expectation is that Nvidia will share in the revenue streams associated with self-driving vehicle subscriptions. Back in 2021, at the Nvidia investor day conference, founder and CEO Jensen Huang provided an example of how big the auto market could be one day. \"There are 100 million cars sold a year and that's the entire opportunity annually for chips, 100 million cars.\" At the time, Jensen said hypothetically if there's $1,000 worth of Nvidia hardware in each car, that's a $100 billion opportunity. \"However, those cars are driven 10 trillion miles,\" he estimated. If Nvidia were to get $1 per mile as part of a services subscription, he projected, \"It's $10 trillion \u2013 and so, that kind of gives you a sense of the economics involved.\" However you want to slice it, when we consider that current revenue estimates are for Nvidia to do $120 billion this fiscal year, with only $1.4 billion coming from automotive, it's clear that this segment alone has the potential to materially impact total revenues over the coming decade. Bottom line : Near-term we expect the yet-to-be-shipped Blackwell chip platform to result in continued growth. However, we see plenty of opportunities for even more growth as we look longer-term to these new services-oriented opportunities. Apple We're also increasing our Apple price target to $240 per share from $220. But we're reiterating our 2 rating with the stock back to all-time highs intraday Tuesday. The stock had a rough start to the year. But it bottomed in mid-April and found its footing. Then better-than-feared earnings in early May catapulted the stock higher. It got another boost in June after the company unveiled its artificial intelligence strategy. Like other tech stocks, Apple dipped recently. But unlike Nvidia, that weakness was short-lived. AAPL 5Y mountain Apple 5 years We like what we saw at Apple's annual Worldwide Developers Conference (WWDC) and continue to believe that the inability to leverage the new Apple Intelligence AI offering on anything less than last year's iPhone 15 Pro provides the setup for one of the strongest refresh cycles we've seen in years. Keep in mind, we haven't even seen what new features the iPhone 16 will have beyond the AI tools. New iPhone launch events are usually in September. In addition to a hardware upgrade cycle, we think the introduction of generative AI and integrating it more deeply with users' personal devices \u2013 in a way only Apple can \u2013 will provide for a new level of service opportunities, resulting in a greater share of revenue coming from this recurring, high-margin segment of the operation. Bottom line : We think the introduction of Apple Intelligence \u2014 as well as the potential for what spatial computing (the mixed reality Vision Pro headset) can become as the form factor of devices (and prices) decrease \u2014represents the beginning of a new generation for Apple.

Jim Clyburn, of South Carolina, both Democrats, said Tuesday it is fair to raise concerns about President Joe Biden's fitness after he stumbled through his first debate with former President Donald Trump on Thursday.\n\n\"I think it's a legitimate question to say, 'Is this an episode or is this a condition?'\" Pelosi said in an MSNBC interview, noting that the question should be asked of both Biden and Trump.\n\nIn a separate MSNBC interview shortly after, Clyburn echoed that it is reasonable to wonder whether Biden's debate performance is a signal of a larger medical issue: \"I'll have to wait on the experts in medicine to give their opinion, because I'm not a doctor, so I have no idea the extent to which all of this may have occurred.\"\n\nClyburn added he has a phone call with Biden scheduled for later Tuesday.\n\nIn response to Pelosi and Clyburn's comments, the White House said questioning the president's cognitive abilities is \"fair\" but that the administration has been transparent enough about his medical records.\n\n\"I get the question. It is a fair question to ask,\" White House Press Secretary Karine Jean-Pierre said at a Tuesday press briefing when asked about Pelosi's comments. \"As it relates to his medical records, we have been transparent, we have released thorough reports from his medical team every year.\"\n\nShe added that Biden's medical team does not find further cognitive testing warranted, despite his poor debate showing.\n\nJean-Pierre also said that Biden's doctor, Kevin O'Connor, did not have any concerns about the president's medical status after the debate: \"Not at all.\"\n\nPelosi's and Clyburn's comments come as Democrats monitor the scale of damage from Biden's difficult debate. Several polls so far have found that the Biden-Trump rematch remains a near dead heat.\n\nA new CNN poll published Tuesday found Trump with a 6-point lead on Biden in a head-to-head matchup, unchanged from the survey's April results. The margin of error for that question was plus or minus 3.7 percentage points.\n\nThe poll surveyed 1,045 registered voters from June 28 to 30, the three days following the debate, which means it represents respondents' immediate reactions.\n\nBoth Democrats reiterated their support for Biden for as long as he stays in the presidential race.\n\n\"I want this ticket to continue to be Biden-Harris, and then we'll see what happens after the next election,\" Clyburn said.",

        "body": "An insurance crisis that has sent premiums skyrocketing and caused carriers to flee coastal states like Florida and California is spreading, and it is fundamentally changing the real estate market in states across the country.\n\n\"Not only is the cost higher than people anticipated, but just the inability to secure insurance at all makes deals fall through before they even happen,\" said Bill Baldwin, owner of Boulevard Realty in Houston.\n\nIncreasingly, Baldwin said, he and other brokers are seeing insurance companies swoop in just as deals are about to close, making nearly impossible demands.\n\n\"A new roof, for roofs that are only seven years old, or 10 years old. They want trees cut down that are within 20 feet of the edge of the house. Oftentimes those trees are on the neighbor's property,\" he said.\n\n\"And when that can't happen, you can't get insurance, which causes the sale to fall through.\"\n\nA similar dynamic is playing out in commercial real estate, said Ross Markowitz, director of insurance risk management at AEW Capital Management, a global real estate investment advisory firm in Boston.\n\n\"We're having to really educate our internal teams,\" he said. \"Don't expect your buyers to be able to get the pricing of insurance that we have, so they'll probably [want] to offer less for the deal.\"\n\nMounting insurance losses\n\nThe new dynamic comes after several years of staggering losses for the insurance industry from natural disasters, including nearly $80 billion in insured losses last year alone, according to the Insurance Information Institute.\n\n\"It's directly related to climate risk,\" said Jeremy Porter, head of climate implications at the nonprofit First Street Foundation, which quantifies climate-related risks. He said that insurance companies are increasingly interested in the organization's data.\n\n\"Insurance companies are responding to the fact that we're seeing more frequent and more severe climate events, and the fact that they're paying out more than they're bringing in,\" he said.\n\nLeash Yu, managing director of personal lines at Higginbotham in Houston, said insurance carriers are scrambling to maintain their financial ratings and, in some cases, just to stay in business.\n\n\"There's three things they can do. They can drastically increase rates, they can get rid of some of their risks, or they can severely limit the type of the new business that comes in,\" he said. \"And some carriers are doing all three.\"\n\nHurricanes, wildfires and extreme premiums\n\nThe crisis showed up first in Florida, which has endured three major hurricanes in two years. Florida policyholders now pay nearly five times the national average, according to Insurify. With multiple carriers either leaving the state or going out of business, the state's insurer of last resort \u2014 Citizens \u2014 has seen its policy count triple in four years, to nearly 1.2 million. Now, Citizens is asking regulators to approve a 14% rate increase.\n\nIn California, where at least eight carriers have left the state or limited their exposure, that state's insurer of last resort \u2014 the California FAIR Plan\u2014 has seen a 14% jump in policyholders this year alone, and a 137% increase since 2019.\n\nIn Louisiana, homeowners are paying roughly three times the national average, according to Insurify.",

        "title": "Peloton staved off the cash crunch that threatened its business. Where does it go now?",
        "body": "In this article PTON Follow your favorite stocks CREATE FREE ACCOUNT\n\nA Peloton Bike inside a showroom in New York, US, on Wednesday, Nov. 1, 2023. Peloton Interactive Inc. is scheduled to release earnings figures on November 2. Michael Nagle | Bloomberg | Getty Images\n\nPeloton no longer faces an imminent liquidity crunch after a massive debt refinancing, but the company still has a long road ahead to fix its business and get back to profitability. In late May, the connected fitness company secured a new $1 billion term loan, raised $350 million in convertible senior notes and received a new $100 million line of credit from JP Morgan and Goldman Sachs. All of those are due in 2029. The refinance reduced Peloton's debt from about $1.75 billion to around $1.55 billion and pushed off looming due dates on loans that it likely wouldn't have had the cash to pay back. Before the refinancing, Peloton would have needed to pay around $800 million toward its debt by November 2025. If it managed to pay that, about another $200 million still would have been due around three months later. The term loan would have been due in May 2027. For Peloton, which hasn't turned a net profit since December 2020 and has seen sales fall for nine straight quarters, the debt pile posed an existential threat and fueled investor concerns about a possible bankruptcy. Now that it has refinanced, Peloton has eased investor concerns about liquidity and has the breathing room it needs to try to turn around its business. The fact that it was able to secure these loans signals investors believe in its ability to rightsize its business and eventually pay them back, restructuring experts told CNBC. \"This refinancing is now putting us in a much better position for sustainable, profitable growth and just a much stronger financial footing than where we were before, and our investors saw that,\" finance chief Liz Coddington told CNBC in an interview. \"I think they believe in the story. They believe in what we're trying to do, as do we, and in the transformation of the business. And so it was just a great vote of confidence for Peloton's future.\"\n\nPeloton faces risks ahead\n\nWhile the refinance may have bought Peloton some time, it's far from a panacea. Under the terms, Peloton will now be spending about $133 million annually in interest, up from around $89 million previously. It will make Peloton's efforts to sustain positive free cash flow more difficult. Coddington acknowledged to CNBC that the higher interest expense is going to \"impact\" free cash flow, but said that's partly why the company started to cut costs in early May. The plan is expected to reduce annual run-rate expenses by more than $200 million. Even with the higher interest payments, Coddington expects the company will be able to sustain positive free cash flow without having the business \"materially grow in the near term.\" \"The cost reduction plan made us much more comfortable with that,\" said Coddington. While Peloton insists that investors bought into its refinance because they believe in its strategy, some could be trying to put themselves in a better position if the company fails. Two of Peloton's largest debt holders, Soros Fund Management and Silver Point Capital, are known to sometimes invest in distressed companies. Since the Peloton loans they invested in are secured, they are near the top of the capital structure. If Peloton can't turn its business around and ends up in a position where it's considering or filing for bankruptcy, its creditors would be in a strong position to take control of the company. \"I would describe this refinancing slash recapitalization as sort of opportunistic,\" said Evan DuFaux, a special situations analyst at CreditSights and an expert in distressed debt. \"I think that's just sort of a smart, opportunistic and kind of tricky move.\" Silver Point declined to comment. Soros didn't return a request for comment.\n\nMore cost cuts to come?\n\nPeloton is in a far better cash position than it was a few months ago, but the company still needs to address the demand issues that have plagued it since the Covid-19 pandemic wound down and figure out what kind of business it will be in the future. \"It really is an exercise in kicking the can down the road because the refinancing itself buys time, but it doesn't actually fix any of the underlying problems at Peloton,\" said Neil Saunders, managing director of GlobalData Retail. \"Those are very different issues to the refinancing.\" Following former CEO Barry McCarthy's departure and with two board members, Karen Boone and Chris Bruzzo, now in charge, Peloton needs to decide: is it a content company, like the Netflix for fitness, or is it a hardware company that needs to develop new strategies to sell its pricey equipment? So far, straddling both has proven to be unsuccessful. \"They're going to have to make some decisions about which parts of the model are survivable, which parts are not, or things that they can do to advance forward without losing the great brand value that they still currently have, especially with the loyal following that they have,\" said Scott Stuart, the CEO of the Turnaround Management Association and an expert in corporate restructurings. \"Money doesn't fix everything, and the issue becomes the more money you take and the more you refinance ... the more problematic it becomes,\" he added. Simeon Siegel, a retail analyst for BMO Capital Markets, said Peloton can start addressing its issues by forgetting about trying to grow the business for now and instead focus on \"bear hugging\" its millions of brand loyalists. He pointed out that the company makes about $1.6 billion in recurring, high-margin subscription revenue and sees more than $1.1 billion in gross profit from that side of the business. \"The problem is, they lose money. How do you lose money if you're generating a billion one of recurring gross profit dollars?\" said Siegel. \"Well, you take all of that gross profit and you spend it to try and chase new growth.\" He said Peloton could generate around $500 million in EBITDA if it cuts research and development, marketing and other corporate expenses. For example, Peloton's marketing budget is around 25% of annual sales, and if the company reduces it to even 10%, it would still be in the \"upper echelon of most brands,\" said Siegel. \"Their debt is scary on a company that's burning cash, their debt's not scary at all on a company that can make half a billion dollars of EBITDA,\" he said. \"They have a business that's generating a tremendous amount of cash. They need to stop spending it.\" In May, Peloton announced it would cut 15% of its corporate workforce, but it may be more reluctant to back off its growth strategy. Peloton founder John Foley set a goal of growing to 100 million members, and McCarthy adopted the target when he took over. As of the end of March, Peloton had about 6.6 million members \u2014 woefully behind that long-term target. Since the company announced its cost cutting plan, McCarthy's departure and another disastrous earnings report in early May, Peloton has been largely mum on its strategy. It said that it's searching for a new permanent CEO, and the person it hires will offer clues about the company's direction. If it hires another \"hyper growth tech CEO\" like McCarthy \u2013 who had done stints at Netflix and Spotify \u2013 then Peloton will likely face the same issues, Siegel said. But if it taps someone different, it could signal a strategy shift.\n\nContent magic",

        "body": "Vehicles are offered for sale at a GM dealership in Lincolnwood, Illinois, on June 20, 2024.\n\nDETROIT \u2014 General Motors reported its best quarterly sales in more than three years, including notable increases in full-size pickup trucks and all-electric vehicles.\n\nThe Detroit automaker on Tuesday reported sales of 696,086 for the second quarter, up 0.6% from a year earlier and its highest quarterly units sold since the fourth quarter of 2020.\n\nIts EV deliveries increased 40% compared to a year earlier to 21,930 units. Still, EVs made up only 3.2% of its total second-quarter sales.\n\nSales of GM's full-size pickup trucks were roughly 229,000 during the second quarter, up about 6% from a year earlier and the best quarterly sales since 2021.\n\nGM's total sales through the first half of the year were down 0.4%, however, compared to a year earlier to roughly 1.3 million vehicles.\n\nGM's second-quarter sales are expected to slightly outpace the overall industry. Auto industry forecasters such as Cox Automotive and Edmunds expect second-quarter sales industrywide, including July 1, to be roughly level from a year earlier amid slowing retail demand.\n\nAn unknown outlier in the second quarter is how much of an effect cyberattacks on dealer software provider CDK Global will have on sales. The June 19 ransomware attack forced CDK, a market leader, to shut down its dealer management system, affecting close to half of all dealerships in North America.\n\n\"The CDK cyberattacks have thrown a monkey wrench into sales during the second half of June, affecting what is arguably one of the most lucrative and busiest times of the month and quarter for dealerships,\" said Jessica Caldwell, Edmunds' head of insights.\n\nGM, in a statement, said its \"dealers who use the CDK platform are working to meet strong customer demand under difficult circumstances. Some deliveries may be delayed until Q3.\"\n\nDealers, including the industry's largest publicly traded ones, were forced to delay sales or figure out workarounds to sell vehicles since the attacks occurred.\n\nAll six of the major publicly traded franchised dealership groups have disclosed their exposure to the CDK issue. Five of the six \u2014 Asbury Automotive Group , AutoNation Inc. , Group 1 Automotive Inc. , Lithia Motors Inc. and Sonic Automotive Inc. \u2014 use CDK as their primary dealership management system provider, according to Automotive News.\n\n\"The good news is \u2014 unlike other black swan events that the industry has contended with in the past \u2014 sales shouldn't be lost or severely deferred, but rather pushed into the third quarter,\" Caldwell said.\n\nSeparately on Tuesday, Toyota reported its second-quarter sales.

        "body": "Former President Donald Trump gives the keynote address at Turning Point Action's \"The People's Convention\" in Detroit, June 15, 2024. Bill Pugliano | Getty Images\n\nAt a June 18 campaign rally in Racine, Wisconsin, former President Donald Trump slammed the Biden administration's efforts to forgive student debt as \"vile\" and \"not even legal.\" \"The students aren't buying it, by the way,\" Trump said to a crowd of a couple of thousand people near Lake Michigan. Trump also brought up the Supreme Court's decision in 2023 to block President Joe Biden's first attempt at broad student loan cancellation: \"He got rebuked, and then he did it again.\" \"It's going to get rebuked again even more,\" Trump said. As president, Trump called for the elimination of the U.S. Department of Education's existing loan relief programs, including the popular Public Service Loan Forgiveness initiative, which benefits public employees such as members of the U.S. Armed Forces, first responders, public defenders, prosecutors and teachers. He also wanted to slash the department's budget, and his administration halted a regulation aimed at providing loan forgiveness to those defrauded by their schools. Now, as he runs for president again, Trump seems poised to make even deeper cuts to financial aid programs for students. He has repeatedly attacked Biden's loan relief policies, and he said in a campaign video in late 2023 that he wants to close the Education Department altogether. Outstanding education debt in the U.S. exceeds $1.6 trillion, according to a 2022 report by the nonpartisan Congressional Research Service. Nearly 43 million people \u2014 or 1 in 6 adult Americans \u2014 carry student loans, the report said.\n\nRepublican presidential candidate former President Donald Trump holds a campaign rally at Crotona Park in the Bronx borough of New York City, May 23, 2024. Brendan McDermid | Reuters\n\nProject 2025, a set of proposals developed by The Heritage Foundation from more than 100 conservative organizations, says that \"student loans and grants should ultimately be restored to the private sector.\" (Some conservatives argue that private companies would do a better job lending to students than the federal government.) The proposal also calls for reducing affordable repayment options for borrowers and ending the loan forgiveness offered under these plans after a certain period. \"Trump will undo President Biden's student loan forgiveness proposals,\" said higher education expert Mark Kantrowitz. \"He will relax rules on for-profit colleges, as part of deregulation efforts, and propose cuts, including possibly defunding the U.S. Department of Education.\"\n\nwatch now\n\nIn an email response, Steven Cheung, a spokesman for the Trump campaign, referred CNBC to resources, including Trump's campaign website and a range of media articles, in which sources frame student loan forgiveness as a boon to high earners and those who attended elite colleges. Less than 1% of federal student borrowers attended Ivy League colleges, according to an estimate by Kantrowitz. Cheung did not answer specific questions from CNBC about what Trump plans to do regarding student debt and education if he is elected president.\n\nEfforts against student loan relief already in play\n\nMembers of Trump's party, meanwhile, have already stymied many of Biden's efforts to deliver student loan relief. Most recently, lawsuits by Republican-led states, including Florida, Arkansas and Missouri, resulted in two federal judges halting implementation of key parts of the president's new repayment plan, which dramatically reduced many borrowers' monthly payments. The preliminary injunctions prevented the Biden administration from forgiving any more debt under the Saving on a Valuable Education, or SAVE, plan, and from further reducing enrolled borrowers' payments in July, as it planned. On Sunday, however, a federal appeals court granted the Education Department's request to stay one of those injunctions, allowing the department to move ahead with lowering loan bills for SAVE enrollees. Cody Gude, a social media consultant in Tampa, Florida, said he expects if Trump wins it will become more difficult and expensive for him to pay back his student loan debt of about $34,000. \"With inflation and student loans restarting, it's become a lot,\" said Gude, 35. Gude said he was upset that Florida joined the lawsuit against the SAVE plan. He said he was looking forward to his student loan bill decreasing in July so he wouldn't have to deliver groceries through Instacart anymore in addition to his regular job. \"It hurts that my home state doesn't want to help its own citizens,\" Gude said. He said he worries that if elected Trump would roll back financial relief options for young people, and that he plans to vote for Biden.\n\nBringing 'free market forces' to student lending\n\nMany voters welcome Trump's stance on student loan relief and question the fairness of forgiving the loans of those who have benefited from a higher education. Just 15% of Republicans find student loan forgiveness important, compared with 58% of Democrats, according to a national poll from mid-May by the University of Chicago Harris School of Public Policy and The Associated Press-NORC Center for Public Affairs Research. The Biden administration's most recent student loan forgiveness proposal garnered a record number of public comments, with more than 148,000 people sharing their opinion. \"I call on the Biden administration to stop imposing an unjust burden on Americans who did not go to college or have paid off their student loan debt,\" one person wrote. Another commented: \"I worked overtime and three part-time jobs when I pursued a graduate degree.\" \"College is a personal choice that comes with many adult decisions,\" the second person said. \"It is not the federal government's responsibility to pass those personal decisions off onto our country's taxpayers.\" Elaine Parker, president of the Job Creators Network Foundation, a conservative advocacy group, said Biden was only forgiving student debt in an effort to buy votes. \"They don't want to solve the problem,\" Parker said. She said the root cause of the student loan crisis was skyrocketing college tuition.\n\nProtesters from We The 45 Million project a message on the outside of the U.S. Department of Education building in Washington asking the department to cancel student debt, March 14, 2022. Paul Morigi | Getty Images Entertainment | Getty Images\n\nParker said Congress needs to hold legislative hearings and bring in campus leaders to justify their tuition hikes, excessive administrative costs and degree programs that lack transparency on career outcomes. She also said the private sector should play a bigger role in financing higher education. \"Why are the banks taken out of this?\" Parker asked. \"We've lost the free market forces in the college lending system.\"\n\nConcerns about Trump's proposals\n\nHigher education experts and consumer advocates expressed concern about the reforms floated by conservatives and Trump. If the U.S. Department of Education were shut down, \"there would be complete chaos,\" Kantrowitz said. Such a move would mean an end to Pell Grants, one of the biggest sources of financial aid available to college students, as well as federal student loans and work study opportunities, he said. \"K-12 education would be in disarray, too,\" Kantrowitz added. Meanwhile, transferring student lending from the government to private companies would only hurt consumers and worsen the crisis, said Aissa Canchola-Banez, political director at Protect Borrowers Action. \"Private lenders put their bottom line ahead of the needs of borrowers and that is a recipe for disaster,\" Canchola-Banez said.",

Terms of the deal were undisclosed.\n\nWith this acquisition, bars, restaurants, casinos and other businesses will be able to stream \"Sunday Ticket\" games. Until recently, they could only do so through a subscription to satellite TV provider DirecTV.\n\nDirecTV will remain as a distributor to bars and restaurants, however. EverPass signed a nonexclusive deal with DirecTV last year to continue to distribute \"Sunday Ticket\" games, giving it the ability to reach deals with other distribution platforms.\n\n\"More content is moving to streaming. Regardless of the streaming economics, it's become pretty clear that live sports is an important piece of that,\" said EverPass CEO Alex Kaplan. \"We're going to think about how to deliver a product and service to our customers that's becoming increasingly more challenging for them to sort of aggregate in a meaningful way. We're still in the early days ... but this is a big step for us.\"\n\nThe new distribution option will be available this coming NFL season.\n\nThe acquisition for EverPass comes as more live sports games are being offered exclusively on streaming services \u2014 a new frontier for business establishments that have long subscribed to traditional pay TV packages to offer live sports.\n\n\"Sunday Ticket\" is an integral sports package for bars and restaurants since it provides all out-of-market NFL games.\n\nIn late 2022, Google' s YouTube TV acquired the residential rights to \"Sunday Ticket\" for roughly $2 billion a year, a deal which runs over seven years. DirecTV had been the owner and exclusive residential and commercial distributor of the games since the package's inception in 1994.\n\nThis followed a deal for Amazon' s Prime Video to become the exclusive home of \"Thursday Night Football\" \u2014 part of the 11-year NFL media rights agreement worth more than $100 billion.\n\nSince then, the media rights owners of NFL games have begun to offer games simultaneously on their streaming services \u2014 and in some cases exclusively. Earlier this year Comcast 's NBCUniversal aired an NFL wild-card game on Peacock, the first time a postseason game was exclusively offered via streaming. Netflix also recently won the rights to air two NFL games on Christmas this year, and at least one on the holiday in the following two years.",

        "body": "You'll need to earn nearly $60,000 annually to live alone in Massachusetts, the most expensive state in the U.S. when it comes to basic costs, according to a recent SmartAsset analysis.\n\nThat figure includes estimates for how much a single-person household needs to cover housing, transportation, health care, taxes and other common expenses, as tracked by the MIT Living Wage calculator.\n\nThese expenses vary widely by state, however, especially housing, taxes and food. The biggest spread in annual cost for a single-person household is $58,009 in Massachusetts compared with $39,386 in West Virginia.\n\nBased on a 40-hour work week, that works out to an hourly wage of about $28 in Massachusetts and about $19 in West Virginia needed to cover basic expenses.\n\nHere's a look at the 15 U.S. states with the highest cost of living, based on how much a single person needs to cover basic costs:\n\nMassachusetts: $58,009 Hawaii: $56,841 California: $56,825 New York: $55,878 Washington: $53,242 Colorado: $51,644 New Jersey: $51,504 Maryland: $51,460 Oregon: $50,553 Rhode Island: $50,418 Connecticut: $50,194 Virginia: $49,973 New Hampshire: $49,045 Arizona: $48,677 Georgia: $48,448\n\nHousing is by far the biggest factor in most people's budgets. At a median of $17,000, housing costs in the 15 most expensive states are nearly double that of the 15 least expensive states.\n\nUnsurprisingly, housing costs are higher in states with large cities, like California and New York. Big cities tend to attract people because of job opportunities, which increases the demand for homes and subsequently drives up prices.\n\nThe difference in cost of living between states is also related to food and tax costs, which vary by as much as $2,000 and $1,500, respectively.\n\nNote that these expense estimates only cover necessities, so they don't include discretionary spending like entertainment or investment contributions.\n\nUnfortunately, minimum wage won't cover basic expenses in any state, even for states that far exceed the federal minimum hourly wage of $7.25. This includes California's newly enacted $20 per hour minimum wage for fast food workers, which doesn't cover the $27.32 needed to pay for a single full-time worker's basic expenses in that state, according to MIT's data.\n\nMIT's Living Wage calculator is based on data from various federal agencies, adjusted for inflation as of December 2023.\n\nWant to be a successful, confident communicator?

        "body": "Taylor Swift performs on stage during The Eras Tour on June 28, 2024 in Dublin, Ireland. Charles Mcquillan/tas24 | Getty Images Entertainment | Getty Images\n\nTaylor Swift's European tour was top of mind for Nikita Rao when planning where to go for her family's annual summer vacation. Rao, her husband and two kids, who live in Bethesda, Maryland, headed overseas this past weekend: They have tickets to the pop star's concert in Amsterdam on Thursday. The family built a weeklong itinerary around The Eras Tour event, spending a few days in London before making their way to the Netherlands for the show. They would have likely visited the two cities at some point in the future, but the Swift concert accelerated their timeline, said Rao, 43, who also saw a performance in Cincinnati last year with her daughter. \"My view on it was, we should do this \u2014 London and Amsterdam \u2014 because she'll be there,\" Rao said. \"If I can get tickets, that'll just make the whole vacation amazing,\" she said of her thought process.\n\nWhy Taylor Swift is unique to 'passion tourism'\n\nTaylor Swift fans gather outside Santiago Bernab\u00e9u Stadium for a concert in Madrid, Spain, on May 29, 2024. David Benito | Getty Images Entertainment | Getty Images\n\nIt's not just the Rao family. Americans are flocking overseas to see Taylor Swift, perhaps the most prominent recent example of so-called \"passion tourism,\" according to travel experts. Passion tourism revolves (unsurprisingly) around people's passions. While place is also generally important, these trips are generally guided by personal interest, hobby or a cultural event, experts said. This isn't a new concept. In fact, there are many recent and upcoming examples: February's annual Carnival festival in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil; April's total solar eclipse in North America; the 2024 Paris Olympics that start this month; and the ongoing UEFA European Football Championship (known as the Euro Cup) in Germany. \"Memorable events are driving travel trends, whether it is for concerts or sporting events,\" Mastercard wrote recently in its annual travel trends report. More from Personal Finance:\n\nFlying is cheaper in 2024. But not for some destinations\n\nVacationers expect to carry summer travel debt\n\n5 ways to maximize your vacation days However, what distinguishes Taylor Swift concerts in the realm of passion tourism is the broad interest and enthusiasm among Americans who want to travel abroad, according to travel agents. \"I've never seen this excitement to travel to go see an artist,\" said Jessica Griscavage, a travel advisor and founder of Runway Travel. The most recent example that might come close is a Spice Girls concert in the 1990s, she said. Griscavage, who put together the Rao family's itinerary, also assembled a separate Swift-centered trip to Paris for a daughter, mother and grandmother. More than half of Americans, 53%, identify as fans of Taylor Swift, according to a poll by Morning Consult. About 16% consider themselves \"avid\" fans.\n\nwatch now\n\n\"Beyonc\u00e9 is big, too, but we don't usually get requests like, 'I have Beyonc\u00e9 tickets for Europe and we want to build a trip around it,'\" said Sofia Markovich, a travel advisor and founder of Sofia's Travel. She assembled trips for two U.S. clients who had tickets for Taylor Swift shows in England and Switzerland, respectively. \"Just as Grateful Dead fans were known to follow the band from city to city to be part of a unique community, Swifties \u2014 often with friends and family in tow \u2014 have made traveling to her concerts part of the experience,\" Joshua Friedlander, vice president of research at the U.S. Travel Association, wrote recently about the so-called \"Swift Lift.\"\n\n'Inevitable' that Swifties will travel to new places\n\nAbout 15.9 million Americans traveled internationally in the first quarter of 2024, an all-time high, according to Mastercard's travel report. Consumers are also spending for travel at record levels globally, it said. Passion tourism generally provides an economic boost to host nations, experts said. For example, spending by tourists at restaurants, bars and grocery stores during the 2024 Carnival in Rio was 156% above normal, Mastercard found. During the solar eclipse, hotel sales within the U.S. path of totality rose 71%, it said.\n\nSpectators looking up at the solar eclipse at the Indianapolis Motor Speedway in Indianapolis, Indiana, on April 8, 2024. Nurphoto | Getty Images\n\nAbout 1.2 million fans will see a Taylor Swift concert this summer across four cities in the United Kingdom (Edinburgh, Liverpool, Cardiff and London), according to a recent Barclays analysis. Each fan will spend an average 848 British pounds (about $1,073) on tickets, travel, accommodation, outfits and other expenses, amounting to a total 997 million British pounds (about $1.3 billion), Barclays estimated. Accommodation accounts for the largest outlay after tickets, followed by travel, according to the Barclays analysis. Searches for Airbnb stays in European cities during Taylor Swift's The Eras Tour dates are up about 70% relative to the same period in 2023, according to a recent analysis.\n\nBeyonc\u00e9 is big, too, but we don't usually get requests like, 'I have Beyonc\u00e9 tickets for Europe and we want to build a trip around it.' Sofia Markovich travel advisor\n\nRome and Paris are traditionally among Americans' top destinations to visit abroad. However, it's \"inevitable\" that Swift fans will end up in a city they may have previously overlooked, like Edinburgh, said Christopher Nulty, global head of corporate communications and public affairs at Airbnb. When tickets went on sale last year for Edinburgh concert dates, searches for lodging in the city by Americans jumped 500%, Nulty said. A concert \"combines the opportunity to travel somewhere incredible with the opportunity to see an artist they love,\" he said.",

        "title": "History suggests bitcoin will likely hit a new all-time high this year, report says",
        "body": "In this photo illustration, a visual representation of the digital Cryptocurrency, Bitcoin is on display in Paris, France, on March 5, 2024.\n\nThat has been centered around an event called the halving , during which the reward for miners is cut in half, reducing the supply of bitcoin onto the market.\n\nThe bitcoin \"cycle\" refers to the period in which the digital currency ascends to a new record high, then falls again to enter a bear market or \"crypto winter.\" These cycles \u2014 of which three have now been completed since the launch of bitcoin \u2014 have tended to follow a similar pattern.\n\nETFs allow investors to buy a product that tracks the price of bitcoin without owning the underlying cryptocurrency. Crypto proponents say this has helped legitimize the asset class and make it easier for larger institutional investors to get involved.\n\nThe journey to the record high in March was largely driven by the approval and launch of the spot bitcoin exchange-traded funds, or ETFs , in the U.S. in January. They have attracted net inflows to date of around $14.41 billion to date, according to CCData.\n\nBitcoin hit an all-time high of above $73,700 in March but has since been trading within a range between roughly $59,000 and $72,000.\n\nBitcoin has not reached the top of its current appreciation cycle and is likely to go past its all-time high this year, according to a research report released by CCData on Tuesday.\n\nTypically, halving often occurs months before bitcoin hits an all-time high for the cycle. This current cycle has been different. Bitcoin rose to its latest record high before halving due to the bullishness around the ETFs in the U.S.\n\nWith bitcoin trading within a range after the all-time high, many have questioned whether the cryptocurrency has reached the top of the current cycle.\n\nCCData's report, which examined historical bitcoin price movements, suggests it can reach a new height. The data and research firm said historical trends have shown that the halving event has always preceded a period of price expansion that can last anywhere from 366 days to 548 days \"before producing a cycle top, with each halving experiencing a longer cycle than the one prior, due to maturation of the asset class and lowered volatility.\"\n\nThe last bitcoin halving took place on April 19 this year, so those historical timeframes have yet to pass.\n\n\"Moreover, we have observed a decline in trading activity on centralised exchanges for nearly two months following the halving event in previous cycles, which seems to have mirrored this cycle. This suggests that the current cycle could expand further into 2025,\" CCData said.\n\nThe analysts acknowledged that the \"influence of institutional participants in the industry\" in the current cycle has \"altered the previous trends,\" adding that low trading activity is likely to take place in the third quarter, which could in turn suggest more sideways price action.\n\n\"However, the data and previous trends are strong enough to suggest that any sideways price action is temporary, and we are likely to breach the previous all-time highs once again before the end of the year,\" CCData said.\n\nThe company's report said that the upcoming launch of an Ethereum ETF in the U.S. and other similar products around the world \"is destined to bring further capital, liquidity and demand to the asset class.\"\n\nCCData highlighted another key historical data point to support its thesis, saying that the price appreciation of bitcoin takes place over a short time. For example, in the 2012 cycle, 91.4% of bitcoin's overall price expansion from halving to the record high happened in the four months before the cycle peak. This share of price increase was 78.8% and 71.5% in the four months before the respective record highs of the 2016 and 2020 cycles.\n\n\"Such parabolic expansion is yet to be made in the current cycle,\" CCData said.\n\nOther commentators have highlighted how historical patterns in bitcoin have played out.\n\n\"Historically, market cycles peak 12 to 18 months after a Bitcoin Halving, which last took place in April of this year. We also haven't seen volatility reach prior peak highs. Lastly, prior market cycle peaks coincided with a rapid succession of all time highs \u2013 upwards of 10 to 20 new highs set in a 30-day window,\" Thomas Perfumo, head of strategy at cryptocurrency exchange Kraken told CNBC by email.\n\n\"We haven't triggered any of these signals yet,\" Perfumo said.",

Ellucian's study found that 44% of the 1,500 students surveyed said they'd switch their top choice school if offered just $5,000 more in aid. \"It's a surprisingly small amount when you look at the total cost,\" Ellucian CEO Laura Ipsen said of the difference that award money made in the decision-making process.\n\nThe FAFSA's impact on decision-making\n\n\"It was not only about the financial aid piece, which is huge, but comparing different offers coming in at different times,\" said Eric Greenberg, president of Greenberg Educational Group, a New York-based consulting firm. \"It did have a big impact on the way people made decisions.\" In previous years, financial aid award letters were sent out at about the same time as admission letters, meaning students had several weeks to compare offers ahead of National College Decision Day, the deadline for most admitted students to decide on a college.\n\nBecause of the extensive delays this year, some students won't get their final financial aid award letter until the end of August, the U.S. Department of Education said in a recent update. That could mean some students will start their fall semester before they get key information about how much that's going to cost. It also marks \"the first admission\" by the Education Department that the FAFSA won't be fully functional until after the start of the 2024-25 award year, which began July 1, according to higher education expert Mark Kantrowitz. \"Time is so critical when students are making decisions,\" Ellucian's Ipsen said. \"The sooner you can get an offer into students' hands, the more likely they are to take it,\" she said. And it's not just about whether they will get to go to their top-choice school, she added, but whether they go to college at all.\n\nThe FAFSA is still an obstacle",

CNBC Daily Open brings investors up to speed on everything they need to know, no matter where they are. Like what you see? You can subscribe here .\n\nTraders work on the floor during morning trading at the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) on March 06, 2024 in New York City.\n\nMore records\n\nThe S&P 500 closed above 5,500 for the first time as Fed Chair Jerome Powell said the central bank had made progress on inflation. The S&P 500 and the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite closed at record highs, with Tesla soaring 10% after sales fell less than expected. The Dow Jones Industrial Average added 162 points. The yield on the 10-year Treasury slipped as Powell indicated that the bank needs more time before cutting rates. U.S. oil prices dropped back from two-month highs.\n\nTesla soars\n\nTesla's shares surged 10.2% after the EV maker beat second-quarter production and delivery expectations. However, total deliveries still fell 4.8% year-over-year, though they rose 14.8% from the first quarter. The decline comes as Tesla faces increased competition, particularly in China, and an aging vehicle lineup. To stimulate sales, Tesla has offered various discounts and incentives, such as zero-interest loans for Model 3 and Model Y purchases in China.\n\nInflation progress\n\nPowell said the central bank had made \"quite a bit of progress\" on inflation over the past year but said he wants to see more before being confident enough to start cutting interest rates. \"The last [inflation] reading and the one before it to a lesser extent, suggest that we are getting back on the disinflationary path,\" Powell said at a central banking forum in Sintra, Portugal. \"We want to be more confident that inflation is moving sustainably down toward 2% before we start the process of reducing or loosening policy.\"\n\nAlzheimer drug approval\n\nThe FDA has approved Eli Lilly's Alzheimer's drug, donanemab, expanding treatment options for the nearly 7 million Americans with the disease. Eli Lilly has faced obstacles in its path to market. The FDA rejected the drug's approval last year due to insufficient data, then surprisingly delayed it again in March. Donanemab will now compete with Biogen and Japanese partner Eisai's Leqembi, which gained approval last year.\n\nParamount bid?\n\nShares of Paramount Global popped 9% in extended trading after news of a potential deal between David Ellison's Skydance and National Amusements, Paramount's controlling shareholder. This preliminary agreement could give Skydance control of Paramount, marking a revival of a previously failed deal. While specific terms remain unclear, the previous deal involved a $2 billion payout to National Amusement's controlling shareholder Shari Redstone, $4.5 billion for Paramount's controlling shares and $1.5 billion cash for Paramount's balance sheet.\n\n[PRO] Conviction list\n\nGoldman Sachs has updated its conviction list for the second half of the year, adding three new stocks to the list of \"most differentiated fundamental Buy ideas.\" The list includes 10 stocks that Goldman Sachs research analysts believe will outperform the market.",

        "title": "What a new Labour government will mean for the UK's foreign policy",
        "body": "British opposition Labour Party leader Keir Starmer attends a campaign event at a farm in Oxfordshire, Britain, July 1, 2024. Phil Noble | Reuters\n\nLONDON \u2014 The incoming U.K. government will confront a complex international landscape after Britons head to the polls on July 4. Labour leader Keir Starmer is widely expected to lead his party to victory, pledging to kick-start a \"decade of national renewal,\" following 14 years of rule under the Conservative Party. But the center-left politician will also be seeking to redefine the U.K.'s international image in the wake of Brexit, a recent spat of domestic political and economic blunders, and a more fractured global landscape. CNBC takes a look at the foreign policy priorities for the incoming government.\n\nNavigating U.S.-China trade tensions\n\nHigh on the new government's agenda will be maneuvering sensitive ties between global superpowers and geopolitical rivals, the U.S. and China. Labour will be eager to maintain Britain's so-called special relationship with its trans-Atlantic ally, presenting a united front in areas of shared strategic interest. But it will also need to adapt to a more protectionist and likely unpredictable U.S., particularly in the event of a change in leadership following the November presidential election stateside. \"You could imagine that the relationship between the incoming personalities of Keir Starmer and Donald Trump would be awkward,\" David Dunn, professor of international politics at the University of Birmingham, told CNBC over the phone. \"But they will work together.\"\n\nBritain is in a remarkably ambiguous position \u2014 as is the EU \u2014 dependent on China but also concerned about territorial acquisition and regional threats. David Dunn professor of international politics at the University of Birmingham\n\nProgress on a U.K.-U.S. free trade deal \u2014 one of the key pledges of the Brexit campaign \u2014 is also likely to be limited, given current interest from both the Republican and Democrat administrations. Britain could instead be expected to focus on certain \"sector agreements\" and to continue partnerships on military and critical technologies, Chatham House directors Bronwen Maddox and Olivia O'Sullivan said in a May note. Faced with a more assertive China, Labour is likely to continue the U.K.'s current position of \"deliberate strategic ambiguity,\" Dunn said, mindful of the country's economic ties to Beijing even amid geopolitical and national security concerns. Labour ministers \u2014 like Tories \u2014 met with Chinese-founded fast-fashion giant Shein ahead of a potential London listing despite disputes over its human rights record. \"Britain is in a remarkably ambiguous position \u2014 as is the EU \u2014 dependent on China, but also concerned about territorial acquisition and regional threats,\" Dunn said.\n\nRepairing EU relations\n\nLabour is also likely to foster a closer working relationship with the European Union. Starmer, who campaigned for the Remain movement not to depart the bloc in the U.K.'s 2016 referendum, has said there is \"no case\" for rejoining the EU, including its single market and customs union. He has nevertheless pledged to improve the \"botched\" U.K.-EU deal, including in areas such as trade, research and security. \"There may be opportunities to revisit the core elements of the trading relationship \u2013 not immediately, but after the two sides have rebuilt trust and the relationship is working more smoothly,\" Mujtaba Rahman, Eurasia Group's managing director for Europe, told CNBC by phone.\n\nProtestors march with large flags during The National Rejoin March. Pro-EU groups demonstrated in central London, UK. Sopa Images | Lightrocket | Getty Images\n\nThe U.K.'s steadfast support for Ukraine amid Russia's full-scale invasion has also helped soothe ties with EU neighbors, establishing its post-Brexit role in bolstering European security. This stance looks set to be upheld under a Labour government. \"This support has strengthened the U.K.'s conversation with EU countries about common risks, in turn opening up the chance for more constructive discussion of post-Brexit relations,\" Chatham House's Maddox and O'Sullivan said.\n\nImproving national security\n\nBoosting the U.K.'s national security will also be a key priority for Labour amid rising global tensions and the ongoing wars in Ukraine and the Middle East. In its election manifesto, Labour mirrored Conservative plans to increase defense spending to 2.5% of gross domestic product, but replaced the 2023 timeline with ambitions to deliver the target \"as soon as we can.\"\n\nThe U.K. should play a consistent role on global issues ... particularly on climate change, international development, arms control. Bronwen Maddox and Olivia O'Sullivan directors at Chatham House\n\nGiven the current geopolitical landscape, however, Chatham House advised this defense expenditure should be raised to a minimum of 3%. Starmer has also said that Labour will \"maintain an unshakeable commitment to NATO and our nuclear deterrent, and put a renewed focus on improving morale in our armed forces.\" However, discussions over the future shape the trans-Atlantic military alliance are likely to continue into the next U.S. administration.\n\nStrengthening international order",

France's benchmark 10-year government bond yield has risen above 3.3%, roughly a 12-month high, since the snap election was called by President Emmanuel Macron in the middle of June.\n\nA first-round vote over the weekend was topped by the far-right National Rally party, but analysts said the split suggested a potential hung parliament in the second round on Sunday. This was viewed as a favorable fiscal result by many investors, who are concerned about the tax and spending proposals of both the far right and the far left.\n\nDe Guindos's messaging echoed that of ECB Chief Economist Philip Lane two weeks ago, when he said June's French bond sell-off had not been \"disorderly.\"\n\n\"I think that this is not about monetary policy, this is about fiscal policy,\" De Guindos told CNBC on Tuesday.\n\n\"The reason why, you know, markets would be upset ... for any government, not only for France, is that fiscal policy does not adapt to the [ECB's] new fiscal framework,\" he continued.\n\n\"So I think that the key factor here is going to be to fully respect the fiscal framework that was agreed at the beginning of this year.\"\n\nThe framework released in March requires EU member states with public debt ratios above 60% of GDP or deficits higher than 3% of GDP to submit a four-year fiscal plan to the European Commission, the EU's executive arm.",

Neither proposal has been accepted by the opposing side, however.\n\nOrban's visit crowns months of frequent opposition to the EU's financial aid packages for Kyiv. In a historic, pre-agreed move, Orban left the room in December so EU leaders could take a unanimous stance on opening accession talks with the war-torn country. The bloc formally started membership discussions with Ukraine and Moldova last week, although a long and strenuous path lies ahead.\n\nA self-proclaimed \"peacemaker,\" Orban and his administration have refused to send weapons to Ukraine and have dissented against deeper NATO support of nonmember Kyiv \u2014 but have also agreed not to block NATO initiatives. Orban absented from last month's Ukraine Peace Summit in Switzerland, where Hungary was instead represented by Foreign Minister Peter Szijjarto.\n\nThe Hungarian prime minister has also been one of the few Western leaders to meet the increasingly isolated Kremlin leader Putin since Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine. In October, he reassured Putin that Hungary \"never wanted to confront Russia,\" The Associated Press reported.\n\nThis week's visit comes a day after Orban's nationalistic government assumed the rotating EU presidency under a \"Make Europe Great Again\" slogan sharply reminiscent of the 2016 campaign strapline of former U.S. President Donald Trump. It also takes place two weeks ahead of a key July 9-11 NATO summit where departing Secretary-General Jens Stoltenberg has signaled he expects allies to agree on further long-term financial and security assistance for Ukraine.",

        "body": "A citizen is seen in front of the candidates posters for the 14th presidential elections on the streets ahead of the early presidential election in Tehran, Iran on June 27, 2024. Anadolu | Anadolu | Getty Images\n\nIran is headed for a runoff election on Friday, July 5, that will see an ultra-right-wing hard-liner compete against a reformist during a time of intense economic, social and geopolitical challenges for the Middle Eastern country. The runoff will allow all 61 million eligible Iranian voters to cast their ballots after no presidential candidate managed to win a majority when the country initially voted on June 28 in a snap election, following the death of former Iranian President Ebrahim Raisi in a helicopter crash in May. Amid record-low voter turnout of around 40% on Friday \u2014 the lowest of any presidential election in the Islamic Republic's 45-year existence \u2014 two dramatically different candidates emerged on top. Reformist candidate Masoud Pezeshkian came out ahead with 10.4 million of 24.5 million votes cast, while hard-line former nuclear negotiator Saeed Jalili was just behind with 9.4 million votes. The two other candidates in Friday's race \u2014 Iranian Parliament Speaker Mohammad Bagher Qalibaf and Shiite cleric Mostafa Pourmohammadi \u2014 received 3.3 million votes and roughly 206,000 votes, respectively. Two additional candidates of the six approved to run by Iran's ultra-conservative Guardian Council had dropped out of the race on Thursday. All the candidates are seen as deeply conservative and anti-Western except for Pezeshkian.\n\nA man gestures as he holds up a small election flag during a campaign rally for reformist candidate Massoud Pezeshkian at Afrasiabi Stadium in Tehran on June 23, 2024 ahead of the upcoming Iranian presidential election. Atta Kenare | Afp | Getty Images\n\nA former nuclear negotiator, Jalili currently serves as a representative for Iran's supreme leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, on the Supreme National Security Council, known to be the most hard-line wing of the regime and its highest security body. Jalili, 58, is one of the furthest right-wing candidates approved to run in the snap election and is a longtime Iranian government insider, but has also had several failed attempts at running for office. Pezeshkian meanwhile, is by far the most moderate of Iran's presidential candidates. He formerly served as minister of health under Iran's last reformist president, Mohammad Khatami, from 1997 to 2005, and Khatami among other reformist politicians have endorsed him. The 69-year-old Pezeshkian has also been a member of parliament since 2008. He is a member of the Islamic Consultative Assembly and the vice speaker of parliament. He wants to loosen social restrictions like Iran's strict hijab law and improve relations with the West, including potentially restarting nuclear talks with world powers.\n\nIranian presidential candidate Saeed Jalili casts his vote for the snap presidential election in Tehran, Iran on June 28, 2024.

        "body": "Phobias come in many forms: Some people fear spiders while others fear flying on a plane.\n\nBut the one thing they all have in common is that they're irrational, according to one phobia specialist.\n\n\"A phobia is an irrational response to a benign substance,\" Christopher Paul Jones, a London-based phobia specialist with a clinic on London's Harley Street, told CNBC Make It in an interview.\n\n\"As human beings, we are primitively hardwired that when we experience danger, our amygdala fires off, and then we do one of several things. Most commonly fight, flight, or freeze. So, either get angry and punch the thing, or we run from the thing, or we hide from the thing,\" he said. The amygdala is a part of the brain that processes emotions like fear or motivation.\n\nThis trigger is handy when we were fighting saber-toothed tigers or if we were in actual danger, Jones said. However, a phobia is when that response is to something that isn't dangerous.\n\nJones' clinic has treated a variety of phobias from a fear of water, heights, germs, needles, and even the fear of failure.\n\nHe explained that phobias develop through a conditioned response like that of Pavlov's dogs experiment. That famous experiment was carried out by Russian neurologist Ivan Pavlov who would ring a bell every time he fed his dogs. The dogs eventually started to salivate when they heard the bell ring because they associated it with food.\n\n\"Human beings do the same thing,\" Jones explained. \"Most commonly with a phobia, at some point in your past, your brain has linked danger to something that has happened ... then whenever you think about that thing again in the future, it fires off that old response.\"\n\nJones' recently published book \"Face Your Fears\" guides readers through exercises to help them overcome their fears. He shared his three top tips to overcome any fear with CNBC Make It.",

It delivered 47,774 cars in June, for a first-half total of 188,981 vehicles. Most of the company's cars come with a fuel tank to extend the battery's driving range.\n\nXpeng remained a laggard, delivering 52,028 cars in total in the first six months of the year, including 10,668 vehicles in June.\n\nThat's slightly more than Nio 's 87,426 deliveries for the first six months of 2024, although Nio continued to recover from sluggish performance earlier in the year with a record 21,209 deliveries in June.\n\nBEIJING \u2014 Chinese electric car company Zeekr said Monday it delivered a record number of vehicles in June, making its deliveries for the first half of the year the largest among U.S.-listed Chinese companies only selling pure electric cars.\n\nShares of Zeekr fell by 3.2% in U.S. trading overnight, while Li Auto and Nio both saw shares rise by more than 6%. Xpeng shares rose by nearly 5.2%.\n\nAlso offering hybrids, Huawei's jointly developed Aito brand with car manufacturer Seres delivered 184,286 vehicles in the first six months of the year.\n\nSmartphone and home appliance company Xiaomi said it has delivered more than 10,000 cars in June, bringing total deliveries to more than 25,000 since the Hong Kong-listed company launched its electric SU7 in late March.\n\nBYD delivered 1.6 million new energy passenger vehicles in the first half of the year, up nearly 29% from a year ago. Plug-in hybrid cars accounted for a slightly greater share than battery electric vehicles, and saw faster growth at 39.5% versus 17.7% for battery-only cars.\n\nThat reflects how much of China's new energy vehicle sales are being driven by hybrid-powered vehicles rather than purely battery-powered ones as range anxiety remains a top concern for consumers in China.\n\nCar companies need to improve the battery charging process, Wan Gang, the man credited with spearheading China's electric car strategy, said at a conference last week.\n\nChina's new energy vehicle sales have risen this year to account for 47% of all passenger cars sold in May, according to China Passenger Car Association data, which provides figures mid-month for the prior month. That's up from 32% penetration at the start of the year.\n\nAs part of efforts to boost consumption, China this year has launched a trade-in policy to incentivize new energy vehicle sales.

Regulators are \"still working on it,\" he added, but so far haven't raised any outstanding concerns with the fintech.\n\nStoronsky noted that Revolut's huge size has meant that it's taken longer for the company to get its banking license approved than would have been the case for smaller companies. Several small financial institutions have been able to win approval for a banking license with few customers, he added.\n\n\"U.K. banking licenses are being approved for smaller companies,\" Storonsky said. \"They usually approve someone twice every year,\" and they typically tend to be smaller institutions. \"Of course, we are very large, so it takes extra time.\"\n\nRevolut is a licensed electronic money institution, or EMI, in the U.K. But it can't yet offer lending products such as credit cards, personal loans, or mortgages. A bank license would enable it to offer loans in the U.K. The firm has faced lengthy delays to its application, which it filed in 2021.\n\nOne key issue the company faced was with its share structure being inconsistent with the rulebook of the Prudential Regulation Authority, which is the regulatory body for the financial services industry that sits under the Bank of England.\n\nRevolut has multiple classes of shares and some of those share classes previously had preferential rights attached. One conditions set by the Bank of England for granting Revolut its U.K. banking license, was to collapse its six classes of shares into ordinary shares.\n\nRevolut has since resolved this, with the company striking a deal with Japanese tech investor SoftBank to transfer its shares in the firm to a unified class, relinquishing preferential rights, according to a person familiar with the matter. News of the resolution with SoftBank was first reported by the Financial Times.",

        "body": "Ken Griffin, founder and CEO of Citadel, said he remains skeptical that artificial intelligence could soon make human jobs obsolete as he sees flaws in machine learning models applied in certain scenarios.\n\n\"We are at what is widely viewed as a real inflection point in the evolution of technology, with the rise of large language models. Some are convinced that within three years almost everything we do as humans will be done in one form or another by LLMs and other AI tools,\" Griffin said Friday during an event for Citadel's new class of interns in New York. \"For a number of reasons, I am not convinced that these models will achieve that type of breakthrough in the near future.\"\n\nThe rapid rise of AI has had the world pondering its far-reaching impact on society, including technology-induced job cuts. Elon Musk, CEO of Tesla, is among many who have repeatedly warned of the threats that AI poses to humanity. He has called AI \"more dangerous\" than nuclear weapons, saying there will come a point where \"no job is needed.\"\n\nGriffin, whose hedge fund and electronic market maker have been at the forefront of automation, said machine-learning tools do have their limits when it comes to adapting to changes.\n\n\"Machine learning models do not do well in a world where regimes shift. Self-driving cars don't work very well in the North due to snow. When the terrain changes, they have no idea what to do,\" Griffin said. \"Machine learning models do much better when there's consistency.\"\n\nStill, the billionaire investor thinks the power of advanced technology can't be dismissed in the long term, and he even sees cancer being eradicated one day because of it.\n\n\"The rise of computing power is allowing us to solve all kinds of problems that were just simply not solvable five, 10, 15 years ago,\" Griffin said. \"This is going to radically transform healthcare. We will end cancer as you know it in your lifetime.\"\n\nCitadel has long placed a great emphasis on hiring, not hesitant about putting responsibility into the hands of young employees and even interns, the CEO said.\n\nThe firm's internship program has become one of the most competitive in the country. More than 85,000 students applied for about 300 positions this year, reflecting an acceptance rate of less than 0.5%, which is lower than that of Harvard University and the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.\n\n\"The people we hire today are going to be the leaders of Citadel not in 30 or 40 years, but in just a few years,\" Griffin said.",

        "body": "In this article META\n\nAMZN\n\nMSFT\n\nTSLA\n\nGOOGL\n\nAAPL\n\nNVDA Follow your favorite stocks CREATE FREE ACCOUNT\n\nJensen Huang, co-founder and chief executive officer of Nvidia Corp., displays the new Blackwell GPU chip during the Nvidia GPU Technology Conference on March 18, 2024. David Paul Morris/Bloomberg via Getty Images\n\nThe U.S. stock market has become dominated by about a handful of companies in recent years. Some experts question whether that \"concentrated\" market puts investors at risk, though others think such fears are likely overblown. Let's look at the S&P 500 , the most popular benchmark for U.S. stocks, as an illustration of the dynamics at play. The top 10 stocks in the S&P 500, the largest by market capitalization, accounted for 27% of the index at the end of 2023, nearly double the 14% share a decade earlier, according to a recent Morgan Stanley analysis.\n\nwatch now\n\nIn other words, for every $100 invested in the index, about $27 was funneled to the stocks of just 10 companies, up from $14 a decade ago. That rate of increase in concentration is the most rapid since 1950, according to Morgan Stanley. It has increased more in 2024: The top 10 stocks accounted for 37% of the index as of June 24, according to FactSet data. The so-called \"Magnificent Seven\" \u2014 Apple , Amazon , Alphabet , Meta , Microsoft , Nvidia and Tesla \u2014 make up about 31% of the index, it said.\n\n'A bit riskier than people realize'\n\nSome experts fear the largest U.S. companies are having an outsized influence on investors' portfolios. For example, the Magnificent Seven stocks accounted for more than half the S&P 500's gain in 2023, according to Morgan Stanley. Just as those stocks helped push up overall returns, a downturn in one or many of them could put a lot of investor money in jeopardy, some said. For example, Nvidia shed more than $500 billion in market value after a recent three-day sell-off in June, dragging down the S&P 500 into a multiday losing streak. (The stock has since recovered a bit.) The S&P 500's concentration \"is a bit riskier than people realize,\" said Charlie Fitzgerald III, a certified financial planner based in Orlando, Florida. \"Nearly a third of [the S&P 500] is sitting in seven stocks,\" he said. \"You're not diversifying when you're concentrating like this.\"\n\nWhy stock concentration may not be a concern\n\nThe S&P 500 tracks stock prices of the 500 largest publicly traded companies. It does so by market capitalization: The larger a firm's stock valuation, the larger its weighting in the index. Tech-stock euphoria has helped drive higher concentration at the top, particularly among the Magnificent Seven. Collectively, Magnificent Seven stocks are up about 57% in the past year, as of market close on June 27 \u2014 more than double the 25% return of the whole S&P 500. Chip maker Nvidia's stock alone has tripled in that time. More from Personal Finance:\n\nAmericans struggle to shake off a 'vibecession'\n\nRetirement 'super savers' have the biggest 401(k) balances\n\nHouseholds have seen their buying power grow Despite the sharp increase in stock concentration, some market experts believe the concern may be overblown. For one, many investors are diversified beyond the U.S. stock market. It's \"rare\" for 401(k) investors to own just a U.S. stock fund, for example, according to a recent analysis by John Rekenthaler, vice president of research at Morningstar. Many invest in target-date funds. A Vanguard TDF for near-retirees has a roughly 8% weighting to the Magnificent Seven, while one for younger investors who aim to retire in about three decades has a 13.5% weighting, Rekenthaler wrote in May.\n\nThere's precedent for this market concentration\n\nAdditionally, the current concentration isn't unprecedented by historical or global standards, according to the Morgan Stanley analysis. Research by finance professors Elroy Dimson, Paul Marsh and Mike Staunton shows that the top 10 stocks made up about 30% of the U.S. stock market in the 1930s and early 1960s, and about 38% in 1900.\n\nThe stock market was as concentrated (or more) around the late 1950s and early '60s, for example, a period when \"stocks did just fine,\" said Rekenthaler, whose research examines markets since 1958. \"We've been here before,\" he said. \"And when we were here before, it wasn't particularly bad news.\" When there were big market crashes, they generally don't appear to have been associated with stock concentration, he added. When compared with the world's dozen largest stock markets, the U.S. market was the fourth-most-diversified at the end of 2023 \u2014 better than that of Switzerland, France, Australia, Germany, South Korea, the United Kingdom, Taiwan and Canada, Morgan Stanley said.\n\n'Sometimes you can be surprised'\n\nBig U.S. companies also generally seem to have the profits to back up their current lofty valuations, unlike during the peak of the dot-com bubble of the late 1990s and early 2000s, experts said. Present-day market leaders \"generally have higher profit margins and returns on equity\" than those in 2000, according to a recent Goldman Sachs Research report. The Magnificent Seven \"are not pie-in-the-sky\" companies: They're generating \"tremendous\" revenue for investors, said Fitzgerald, principal and founding member of Moisand Fitzgerald Tamayo. \"How much more gain can be made is the question,\" he added.\n\nYou're not diversifying when you're concentrating like this.

        "body": "The filing showed Roaring Kitty, whose legal name is Keith Gill, bought just over 9 million shares \u2014 amounting to a 6.6% stake in the company. That makes him the third-biggest Chewy shareholder, according to FactSet. Based on Friday's close, that stake is valued at more than $245 million.\n\nThe rally in Chewy shares lost steam Monday as traders reacted to a Securities and Exchange Commission filing that showed meme stock trader \"Roaring Kitty\" took a stake in the pet food e-commerce retailer.\n\nThe SEC filing also included a section that read: \"Check the appropriate box to designate whether you are a cat.\" There was an \"x\" next to a response that read: \"I am not a cat.\" This line was included in Gill's statement in a series of congressional hearings about 2021's GameStop trading mania.\n\nThe stock rallied more than 9% on Monday, but it quickly fell into negative territory in morning trading. Shares ended the day down 6.6%.\n\nChewy shares took a wild ride last week after Gill posted a picture on social media platform X of a cartoon dog that resembled Chewy's logo. The shares were up as much as 34% on Thursday but ended the day down slightly.\n\nCNBC emailed Chewy's public relations team seeking comment on the new shareholder.\n\nGill is known to be a champion of GameStop and has been stirring up trading in the video game company in the last few months. In mid-June, he disclosed a stake of 9.001 million GameStop shares after exiting his massive call options position. It's unclear if he sold his GameStop bet to fund the purchase of Chewy.\n\nGameStop shares fell more than 5% following the news.\n\n\n\nThere's a big connection between GameStop and Chewy. GameStop CEO Ryan Cohen was founder and the first CEO of Chewy, who was instrumental in PetSmart's takeover of Chewy in 2017 and its subsequent initial public offering in 2019.\n\nCohen joined the GameStop board of directors along with two other Chewy executives in January 2021, partly helping fuel the initial GameStop rally. He later took over as GameStop CEO in 2023, leading a turnaround in the brick-and-mortar video game retailer.\n\nIn a recent YouTube livestream, Gill said GameStop is in the second stage of a reinvention, and it has become a bet on Cohen himself, who's also been leading a pivot to e-commerce.\n\nThe investor was hit by a new class-action lawsuit filed Friday, alleging he engaged in securities fraud by manipulating GameStop's stock price through his online influence in May and June. The case was voluntarily dismissed on Monday.\n\nGill is a former marketer for Massachusetts Mutual Life Insurance. He came into the limelight after successfully encouraging retail investors to buy GameStop shares and call options in 2021 to squeeze out short-selling hedge funds.",

A total of 9.93 million shares went to the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation, with the rest going to the Susan Thompson Buffett Foundation, named for his late first wife, and the three charities led by his children Howard, Susan and Peter Buffett.\n\nThe \"Oracle of Omaha\" has pledged to give away the fortune he built at Berkshire, the Omaha, Nebraska-based conglomerate he started running in 1965. Buffett has been making annual donations to the five charities since 2006.\n\nAfter Friday's donations, Buffett owns 207,963 Berkshire A shares and 2,586 B shares, worth about $130 billion.\n\nNew charitable trust\n\nIn an interview with The Wall Street Journal, Buffett clarified that after his death, the enormous fortune he amassed from building the one-of-a-kind conglomerate will be directed to a new charitable trust overseen by his three children.\n\n\"It should be used to help the people that haven't been as lucky as we have been,\" he told the Journal. \"There's eight billion people in the world, and me and my kids, we've been in the luckiest 100th of 1% or something. There's lots of ways to help people.\"\n\nBuffett has previously said his three children are the executors of his will as well as the named trustees of the charitable trust that will receive 99%-plus of his wealth.\n\nHe told the Journal that the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation will no longer receive donations after his death. Buffett resigned as a trustee at the Gates Foundation in June 2021 in the midst of Bill and Melinda Gates' divorce.\n\nAt Berkshire's annual meeting in May, Buffett spoke candidly to shareholders about a future when he's no longer at the helm, appearing solemn at times as he pondered his advanced age and reflected on his late friend and business partner Charlie Munger.\n\nGreg Abel, vice chairman for noninsurance operations at Berkshire, has been named Buffett's successor and has taken on most of the responsibility at the conglomerate.\n\nBuffett previously said his will will be made public after his death.\n\n\"After my death, the disposition of my assets will be an open book \u2013 no 'imaginative' trusts or foreign entities to avoid public scrutiny but rather a simple will available for inspection at the Douglas County Courthouse,\" Buffett said in November.",

The customer, who did not share his first name due to concerns about speaking with foreign media, said many people in China might prefer to buy a secondhand Vision Pro because of the discounted price that typically comes with purchases from sellers unaffiliated with Apple.\n\nMany of the most popular posts about the device on Chinese social media platform Weibo on Friday focused on the hashtag \"is it worth paying for the China version of Vision Pro,\" according to a CNBC translation.\n\nCNBC has reached out to Apple for comment.\n\nGreater China accounted for about 18% of Apple's revenue in the three months that ended March 30, according to an Apple filing.\n\nOver the past year, Apple has faced growing competition from Huawei devices and other domestic brands, amid greater attention on national security.\n\nChen preordered his Vision Pro and was at a major store in Beijing to pick it up and receive some training on how to use it.\n\nStore salespeople told CNBC that all of Friday's half-hour training sessions for preorders of the Vision Pro were booked up at Apple stores in Beijing \u2014 from 8 a.m. to 10 p.m.\n\nChinese companies such as Tencent, Alibaba and JD.com have launched Vision Pro versions of their apps for shopping, playing games and watching videos.",

        "body": "Honor CEO George Zhao (L) and GSMA CEO John Hoffman on stage at Shanghai Mobile World Congress during an awards ceremony on June 27, 2024. Honor\n\nHANGZHOU, China \u2014 The transforming power of artificial intelligence is of no value unless user data is protected, CEO of Chinese smartphone company Honor, George Zhao, told CNBC in an exclusive interview on Thursday. His comments come as Apple this month announced it will start rolling out personalized AI tools on certain devices in the U.S. this fall. Honor already integrates some AI functions, such as enabling users to open text messages and other notifications just by looking at them, or eliminating copy-paste steps by directly linking Yelp-like apps to navigation or ride-hailing apps. This week at Mobile World Congress in Shanghai, Honor unveiled new AI tools for detecting the use of deepfakes in videos, and for simulating lenses that can decrease myopia during long hours of screen usage. Zhao emphasized that Honor's approach is to keep AI operations involving personal data limited to the smartphone. It's also known as on-device AI, and stands in contrast with AI tools that tap cloud computing to operate.\n\nwatch now\n\n\"Without data security and user privacy protection, AI will become worthless,\" Zhao said in Mandarin, translated by CNBC. \"This has always been one of our value propositions.\" \"We say user data doesn't leave [the device],\" Zhao said. \"This is a principle we adhere to.\" Apple Intelligence, the iPhone company's AI product, claims that it uses on-device processing and draws on \"server-based models\" for more complex requests. Apple said its new \"Private Cloud Compute\" never stores user data. Honor says its on-device AI is self-developed, and the company is working with Baidu and Google Cloud for some other AI features. \"Overall, my view is that AI's development to date has two directions,\" Zhao said. \"Network [cloud] AI has become more and more powerful. But I believe on-device AI, in its capabilities and empowerment of consumers, will become more and more intimate, more and more understanding.\" \"It will give consumers more support and help them interact with the future AI world,\" he added.\n\nZhao pointed out that many generative AI applications, such as from OpenAI's ChatGPT, require large amounts of computing power well beyond the battery capability of a single smartphone. That means they need to use the cloud, which raises questions about the security of data transfer. Balancing AI capabilities with energy usage and data privacy is a \"huge challenge\" for manufacturers, Zhao said. He said a system collecting lots of user data to deliver more personalized features becomes a \"stronger\" object compared to the individual using the system. \"In the future development of smartphones, our goal is that the individual becomes stronger,\" Zhao said. \"When an object becomes stronger, this will reveal the smallness of the individual in its presence. I believe mobile end devices need to empower and enable individuals.\"\n\nThe Honor Magic V2, the latest foldable smartphone from the Chinese manufacturer, is on display at the Mobile World Congress 2024 in Barcelona, Spain.

        "body": "A photo illustration of the Chewy logo is seen on a smartphone and a PC screen.\n\nRoaring Kitty, whose legal name is Keith Gill, has stirred up trading in speculative names such as GameStop by posting cryptic images and memes online. A picture of a cartoon dog appeared on his X feed Thursday afternoon, briefly driving up Chewy shares as much as 34% to $39.10. The stock later fell into negative territory again in Thursday's session, closing the day down 0.3%.\n\nChewy shares rallied dramatically on Thursday after meme stock leader Roaring Kitty posted a picture on social media platform X that resembles the logo of the online pet food retailer, but the gains were quickly erased later in the session.\n\nThere's also a strong connection between meme stock GameStop and Chewy. GameStop CEO Ryan Cohen was the founder and CEO of Chewy, who was instrumental in PetSmart's takeover of Chewy in 2017 and its subsequent initial public offering in 2019.\n\nCohen joined the GameStop board of directors along with two other Chewy executives in January 2021, partly helping fuel the initial GameStop rally. He later took over as GameStop CEO in 2023, leading a turnaround in the brick-and-mortar video game retailer.\n\nShares in pet retailers such as Chewy and Petco saw big spikes during the pandemic when stuck-at-home consumers adopted cats and dogs in droves. With the adoptions came purchases of needed accessories such as new beds and leashes for their furry family members.\n\nBut as the pandemic ended and people began venturing outside again, adoption numbers slowed and consumers had less need for discretionary pet items such as toys and cages, which carry higher profit margins than pet food.\n\nOver the past year or so, Chewy and Petco have seen consistently strong pet food sales, but revenue for higher margin categories has fallen.\n\nGill is a former marketer for Massachusetts Mutual Life Insurance. He came into the limelight after successfully encouraging retail investors to buy GameStop shares and call options in 2021 to squeeze out short-selling hedge funds. The mania in 2021 led to a series of congressional hearings featuring Gill in brokers' practices and the \"gamification\" of retail trading.",

This year's version included giants such as JPMorgan Chase and Goldman Sachs , credit card companies including American Express and regional lenders such as Truist .\n\nWhile no bank appeared to get badly tripped up by this year's exercise, which had roughly the same assumptions as the 2023 test, the group's aggregate capital levels fell 2.8 percentage points, which was worse than last year's decline.\n\nThat is because the industry is holding more consumer credit card loans and more corporate bonds that have been downgraded. Lending margins have also been squeezed compared to last year, according to the Fed.\n\n\"While banks are well-positioned to withstand the specific hypothetical recession we tested them against, the stress test also confirmed that there are some areas to watch,\" Barr said. \"The financial system and its risks are always evolving, and we learned in the Great Recession the cost of failing to acknowledge shifting risks.\"\n\nThe Fed also performed what it called an \"exploratory analysis\" of funding stresses and a trading meltdown that applied to only the eight biggest banks.\n\nIn this exercise, the companies appeared to avoid disaster, despite a sudden surge in the cost of deposits combined with a recession. In a scenario where five large hedge funds implode, the big banks would lose between $70 billion and $85 billion.\n\n\"The results demonstrated that these banks have material exposure to hedge funds but that they can withstand different types of trading book shocks,\" the Fed said.\n\nBanks are expected to begin announcing their latest share repurchase plans on Friday.",

Michael Nagle | Bloomberg | Getty Images\n\nMorgan Stanley is pushing further into its adoption of artificial intelligence with a new assistant that is expected to take over thousands of hours of labor for the bank's financial advisors. The assistant, called Debrief, keeps detailed logs of advisors' meetings and automatically creates draft emails and summaries of the discussions, bank executives told CNBC. Morgan Stanley plans to release the program to the firm's roughly 15,000 advisors by early July, marking one of the most significant steps yet for the use of generative AI at a major Wall Street bank. While the company's earlier efforts involved creating a ChatGPT-like service to help advisors navigate the firm's reams of research, Debrief brings AI into direct contact with advisors' most prized resource: their relationships with rich clients. The program, built using OpenAI's GPT-4, essentially sits in on client Zoom meetings, replacing the note-taking that advisors or junior employees have been doing by hand, according to Jeff McMillan, Morgan Stanley's head of firmwide artificial intelligence. \"What we're finding is that the quality and depth of the notes are just significantly better,\" McMillan told CNBC. \"The truth is, this does a better job of taking notes than the average human.\"\n\nConsent required\n\nImportantly, clients must consent to being recorded each time Debrief is used. Future versions will allow advisors to use the program on corporate devices during in-person meetings, said McMillan. The rollout will serve as a real-world test for the vaunted productivity gains of generative AI, which took Wall Street by storm in recent months and has bolstered the value of chipmakers, tech giants and the broader U.S. stock market. Morgan Stanley's wealth management division hosts about 1 million Zoom calls a year, the bank told CNBC. While estimates vary, one Morgan Stanley advisor involved in the Debrief pilot said the program saves 30 minutes of work per meeting; advisors typically spend time after meetings creating notes and action plans to address client needs.\n\nZoom In Icon Arrows pointing outwards Morgan Stanley\u2019s new Debrief program, a new AI tool for wealth management advisors based on OpenAI\u2019s GPT-4. Courtesy: Morgan Stanley\n\n\"As a financial adviser I'm doing four, five or six meetings a day,\" said Don Whitehead, a Houston-based advisor who's been testing the software. By \"having the note-taking service built in through AI, you can really be invested in the meeting, you're actually a lot more present.\" It remains to be seen what advisors will do with the hours reclaimed from essential grunt work. In a sense, Morgan Stanley's projects in generative AI amount to a \"grand experiment in productivity,\" said McMillan. If, as McMillan and others believe, advisors will spend more time serving clients and prospecting for new ones, the technology should boost Morgan Stanley's growth in assets under management, as well as retention of clients and advisors. Morgan Stanley's wealth management division is one of the world's largest with $5.5 trillion in client assets as of March; the firm wants to reach $10 trillion. It will take at least a year to determine whether the technology is boosting advisor productivity, McMillan said. \"I'm the analytics guy, but the advisors will tell you that they're at their best when they're engaging\" with clients, said McMillan. \"None of them will tell you they love taking notes or looking at research reports, right? That's not why they got into this business.\"\n\nThe broader vision",

        "title": "Your 401(k) is up, and a new report shows increased savings. But Americans need to do more",
        "body": "How's your 401(k) looking? A new report shows Americans are saving more, but probably need to do even more.\n\nVanguard has released its annual report, How America Saves 2024. Vanguard and Fidelity are the two biggest sponsors of 401(k) plans, and this is a snapshot of what nearly five million participants are doing with their money.\n\nThe good news: stock market returns are up and, thanks largely to automatic enrollment plans, investors are saving more than they did in the past.\n\nThe bad news: account balances for the median 401(k) of a person approaching retirement (65+) remains very low.\n\nThe takeaway: Americans are still very reliant on Social Security for a large chunk of their retirement.\n\nHigher returns, participation rates, savings rates\n\nWhy do we care so much about 401(k) plans? Because it's the main private savings vehicle Americans have for retirement. More than 100 million Americans are covered by these \"defined contribution\" plans, with more than $10 trillion in assets.\n\nFirst, 2023 was a good year to be an investor. The average total return rate for participants was 18.1%, the best year since 2019.\n\nBut to be effective vehicles for retirement, these plans need to: 1) have high participation rates, and 2) hold high levels of savings.\n\nOn those fronts, there is good news. John James, managing director of Vanguard's Institutional Investor Group, called it \"a year of progress.\"\n\nPlan participation reached all-time highs. Thanks to a change in the law several years ago, a record-high 59% of plans offered automatic enrollment in 401(k) plans. This is a major improvement: ipreviously, enrollment in 401(k) plans were often short of expectations because investors had to \"opt-in,\" that is they had to choose to participate in the plan. Because of indecision or simple ignorance, many did not. By switching to automatic enrollment, participants were automatically enrolled and had to \"opt-out\" if they did not want to participate.\n\nThe result: enrollment rates have gone up. Plans with automatic enrollment had a 94% participation rate, compared with 67% for voluntary enrollment plans.\n\nParticipant saving rates reached all time highs. The average participant deferred 7.4% of their savings. Including employee and employer contributions, the average total participant contribution rate was 11.7%.\n\nA few other observations about Vanguard's 401(k) plan investors:\n\nThey prefer equities and target date funds. They love equities over bonds or any other investments. The average plan contribution to equities is 74%. A record-high 64% of all 2023 contributions went into target-date funds, which automatically adjust stock and bond allocations as the participant ages.\n\nThey don't trade much. In 2023, only 5% of nonadvised participants traded within their accounts; 95% did no trading at all. \"Over the past 15 years, we have generally observed a decline in participant trading,\" Vanguard said, which it partially attributed to increased adoption of target-date funds.\n\nDespite gains in the market, account balances are still low\n\nIn 2023, the average account balance for Vanguard participants was $134,128, but the median balance (half had more, half had less) was only $35,286.\n\nWhy such a big difference between the average and the median? Because a small group of investors with large balances pull up the averages. Forty percent of participants had less than $20,000 in their retirement accounts.\n\nDistribution of account balances\n\nLess than $20,000 40%\n\n$20,000-$99,999 30%\n\n$100,000-$249,900 15%\n\n$250,000 + 15%\n\nSource: Vanguard\n\nMedian balances for those near retirement are still low\n\nA different way to look at the problem is to ask how much people who are retirement age have saved, because it's an indication of how prepared they are for imminent retirement.\n\nInvestors 65 years or older had an average account balance of $272,588, but a median balance of only $88,488.\n\nA median balance of $88,488 is not much when you consider older participants have higher incomes and higher savings rates. That is not much money for a 65-year old nearing retirement.\n\nOf course, these balances don't necessarily reflect total lifetime savings. Some have more than one retirement plan because they had other plans with previous employers. Most do have other sources of retirement savings, typically Social Security. A shrinking number may also have a pension. Some may have money in checking accounts, or have stocks or bonds outside a retirement account.\n\nRegardless, the math does not look great\n\nSo let's do some retirement math.\n\nA typical annual drawdown for a 401(k) account in retirement is about 4%. Drawing down 4% of $88,488 a year gets you $3,539 every 12 months.\n\nNext, Social Security. As of January 2023, the average Social Security benefit was almost $1,689 per month, or about $20,268 per year.\n\nFinally, even though pensions are a vanishing benefit, let's include them.\n\nAccording to the Pension Rights Center, the median annual pension benefit for a private pension is $9,262 (government employees have higher benefits).\n\nHere's our yearly retirement budget:\n\nPersonal savings $3,539\n\nPension $9,262\n\nSocial Security $20,264\n\nTotal: $33,065\n\nIt's certainly possibly to live on $33,000 a year, but this would likely only work if you own your home, have low expenses and live in a low-cost part of the country.\n\nEven then, it would hardly be a robust retirement.\n\nAnd these are the lucky ones. Only 57% of retirees have a tax-deferred retirement account like a 401(k) or IRA. Only 56% reported receiving income from a pension.\n\nAnd that extra income largely determines whether a retiree feels good or bad about their retirement.\n\nIn 2023, four out five retirees said they were doing at least okay financially, but this varied tremendously depending on whether retirees had sources of income outside of Social Security. Only 52% of retirees who did not have private income said they were doing at least okay financially.\n\nWhat can be done?\n\nTo have a more robust retirement, Americans are just going to have to save more.\n\nOne issue is investors still don't contribute the maximum amount allowed. Only 14% of participants saved the statutory maximum amount of $22,500 per year ($30,000 for those age 50 or older). The likely reason: most felt they couldn't afford to.\n\nHowever, only 53% of even those with income over $150,000 contributed the maximum allowed. Given that the employee match is \"free money,\" one would think participants in that income bracket would rationally choose to max out their contribution. The fact that many still don't suggests that more investor education is needed.\n\nRegardless, it's very dangerous to assume that retirees are going to be bailed out by an ever-rising stock market. Another year anywhere near 2022, when the S&P 500 was down 20%, and investor confidence in their financial future will likely deteriorate.",

        "body": "Prince Constantijn is special envoy to Techleap, a Dutch startup accelerator. Patrick Van Katwijk | Getty Images\n\nAMSTERDAM \u2014 Europe is at risk of falling behind the U.S. and China on artificial intelligence as it focuses on regulating the technology, according to Prince Constantijn of the Netherlands. \"Our ambition seems to be limited to being good regulators,\" Constantijn told CNBC in an interview on the sidelines of the Money 20/20 fintech conference in Amsterdam earlier this month. Prince Constantijn is the third and youngest son of former Dutch Queen Beatrix and the younger brother of reigning Dutch King Willem-Alexander. He is special envoy of the Dutch startup accelerator Techleap, where he works to help local startups grow fast internationally by improving their access to capital, market, talent, and technologies. \"We've seen this in the data space [with GDPR], we've seen this now in the platform space, and now with the AI space,\" Constantijn added. European Union regulators have taken a tough approach to artificial intelligence, with formal regulations limiting how developers and companies can apply the technology in certain scenarios.\n\nThe bloc gave final approval to the EU AI Act, a ground-breaking AI law, last month. Officials are concerned by how quickly the technology is advancing and risks it poses around jobs displacement, privacy, and algorithmic bias. The law takes a risk-based approach to artificial intelligence, meaning that different applications of the tech are treated differently depending on their risk level. For generative AI applications, the EU AI Act sets out clear transparency requirements and copyright rules. All generative AI systems would have to make it possible to prevent illegal output, to disclose if content is produced by AI and to publish summaries of the copyrighted data used for training purposes. But the EU's Ai Act requires even stricter scrutiny for high-impact, general-purpose AI models that could pose \"systemic risk,\" such as OpenAI's GPT-4 \u2014 including thorough evaluations and compulsory reporting of any \"serious incidents.\" Prince Constantijn said he's \"really concerned\" that the Europe's focus has been more on regulating AI than trying to become a leader innovating in the space. \"It's good to have guardrails. We want to bring clarity to the market, predictability and all that,\" he told CNBC earlier this month on the sidelines of Money 20/20. \"But it's very hard to do that in such a fast-moving space.\" \"There are big risks in getting it wrong, and like we've seen in genetically modified organisms, it hasn't stopped the development. It just stopped Europe developing it, and now we are consumers of the product, rather than producers able to influence the market as it develops.\" Between 1994 and 2004, the EU had imposed an effective moratorium on new approvals of genetically modified crops over perceived health risks associated with them.\n\nwatch now\n\nThe bloc subsequently developed strict rules for GMOs, citing a need to protect citizens' health and the environment. The U.S. National Academies of Sciences says that genetically modified crops are safe for both human consumption and the environment. Constantijn added that Europe is making it \"quite hard\" for itself to innovate in AI due to \"big restrictions on data,\" particularly when it comes to sectors like health and medical science. In addition, the U.S. market is \"a much bigger and unified market\" with more free-flowing capital, Constantijn said. On these points he added, \"Europe scores quite poorly.\" \"Where we score well is, I think, on talent,\" he said. \"We score well on technology itself.\" Plus, when it comes to developing applications that use AI, \"Europe is definitely going to be competitive,\" Constantijn noted. He nevertheless added that \"the underlying data infrastructure and IT infrastructure is something we'll keep depending on large platforms to provide.\"",

        "body": "Paramount Global is holding talks with other entertainment companies about merging its Paramount+ streaming service with an existing platform. If it reaches a deal, it may kick off a new wave of streaming partnerships that could put the entire media industry on firmer footing.\n\nParamount Global leadership is having active discussions with other media and tech company executives to determine if a structure makes sense for both parties where Paramount+ can be merged with another streaming entity and potentially co-owned, according to people familiar with the matter, who asked not to be named because the discussions are private.\n\nOne of the companies that has expressed a desire to reach a deal is Warner Bros. Discovery , according to people familiar with the matter. Combining Max and Paramount+ could strengthen both services by allowing them to better compete with Netflix and Disney's suite of platforms (Disney+, Hulu and ESPN) for eyeballs and future content.\n\nWarner Bros. Discovery held preliminary merger talks for a deal for all of Paramount Global earlier this year, but talks didn't escalate.\n\nParamount Global is also considering partnering with a technology platform, the company's co-CEO Chris McCarthy said at an employee town hall on June 25.\n\n\"What they don't have is our scale of content, and together we will make for a very powerful combination to drive more minutes and greater profits,\" McCarthy said of a potential tech partner at the town hall, according to a transcript of the event obtained by CNBC.\n\nA merged streaming service would mitigate churn by giving customers more diverse programming and fewer reasons to cancel each month, and it could take Paramount+ losses off Paramount Global's balance sheet by giving it new ownership.\n\nWhile a structure for a hypothetical joint venture with Warner Bros. Discovery hasn't been discussed in detail, ownership likely wouldn't be a 50-50 split given the existing natures of the streaming assets and their finances, according to people familiar with the discussions.\n\nWarner Bros. Discovery's direct-to-consumer business made $103 million in annual adjusted EBITDA in 2023 after losing $2.1 billion the year before. Paramount Global reported a loss of $1.67 billion in direct-to-consumer operating income before depreciation and amortization in 2023, narrower than its $1.8 billion loss a year prior.\n\nMax has about 100 million global subscribers, with 52.7 million based in the U.S. Paramount+ ended its first quarter with 71 million subscribers.\n\nComcast's NBCUniversal has also expressed interest in a joint venture with Paramount+, as The Wall Street Journal first reported earlier this year. The talks didn't progress and never got particularly far, according to people familiar with the matter.\n\n\"The sheer volume of hit content that we could offer together would be tremendous across TV, film and sports, and would attract millions of viewers,\" McCarthy said during the town hall in reference to a potential partnership with an existing subscription streaming service like Max or Peacock. \"Plus, we would share in all other non-content expenses.\"\n\nSpokespeople for Warner Bros. Discovery, NBCUniversal and Paramount Global declined to comment.",

        "title": "Inside Starbucks' plans to improve stores for customers and baristas",
        "body": "watch now\n\nStarbucks cafes across the country are starting to change how they make drink orders, among other tweaks designed to reduce bottlenecks and long wait times that have dogged the chain. The overhaul comes as the coffee giant prepares for an anticipated swell of orders through its mobile app. At the heart of the plan is Starbucks' \"Siren Craft System,\" a series of processes that are aimed at making baristas' jobs easier and speeding up service times for customers. Starbucks said more than 10% of its 10,000 stores have already implemented the system, which includes changing the production order for hot and cold drinks. It will be in use across North America by the end of July, according to the company. Executives hope the changes will provide a much-needed jolt to Starbucks. In April, the company reported a disappointing second quarter, as U.S. same-store sales fell 3% and traffic dropped 7%. The coffee chain cut its 2024 outlook. Starbucks reported rates of incomplete mobile app orders in the mid-teens and said occasional customers came in less. CEO Laxman Narasimhan mentioned the need to make improvements to stores. Katie Young, senior vice president of store operations at Starbucks, said the most immediate shift that needed to happen in cafes was better handling the unexpected. \"It's the ability to flexibly respond to things we cannot predict,\" she told CNBC in an interview.\n\nStarbucks Coffee shop in Krakow, Poland on February 29, 2024. Beata Zawrzel | Nurphoto | Getty Images\n\nThe store changes will be key this month, as Starbucks on Monday started opening up its app to non-rewards members, which the company believes will increase traffic and orders. Analyst Peter Saleh, managing director at BTIG, said, \"My sense is that they have a lot of demand in certain stores, and the footprint of the kitchen is so small, you have to find ways to be more efficient.\" Losing customers because of slow orders and other store frustrations could cost Starbucks at a particularly vulnerable time. Americans have become cost conscious in the face of ongoing inflation, and in some cases have pulled back on morning or afternoon beverages and snacks. Narasimhan in April said consumers are spending more cautiously. Starbucks has done something uncharacteristic in recent weeks, joining the stream of value offerings with a $5 food and beverage combo option. Communicating value to customers is also part of the plan to drum up business.\n\nThe Siren system\n\nStarbucks has been diagnosing the bottleneck issue for more than a year, since the company's reinvention plan rollout in 2022, said Young. At the time, Howard Schultz was at the helm, having returned during a burgeoning unionization movement and shifts in consumer preferences. The changes underway in cafes were first previewed that fall, to be rolled out in the years to come. Narasimhan took over for Schultz in March 2023. The Siren system processes were developed with worker feedback on which issues stopped them from creating beverages and connecting with customers. Starbucks said it plans to add a role akin to an expediter in a restaurant production line, a \"play caller\" who steps away from production and helps solve logjams in cafes, handling tasks such as restocking cups or helping when an unexpected crowd arrives. The company plans to train existing workers for the role or potentially add new baristas, if needed. \"One of the pain points we saw was [that] our espresso machine was often running all the time, and that was one of the things that kept our partners from being able to check in. And another thing we saw that you didn't necessarily know was which part of the store would get crowded,\" Young said. \"We needed to actually have a partner that was dedicated when things got busy to pulling out of production and just helping.\" Starbucks said it will also change the order in which beverages are made. Previously, cold drinks were prioritized from start to finish, even if a hot beverage order came in first, as pulling espresso shots was the last step. This could create a traffic jam in the drive-thru, for example, if a person ordered one of each beverage, as the cold item would be ready while the hot drink was still in production. Macoy McLaughlin, manager of Seattle's First and Walker Starbucks location, said producing beverages in the order they were placed allows for a faster, streamlined process. \"We actually have proper sequencing between our hot and cold bars, versus cold bars becoming as popular as ever, to really have a consistent experience for the customers. So we're actually making them in the order they're coming in,\" McLaughlin said, adding that the cafe feels busier, but customers in store and in the drive-thru are getting drinks faster. Baristas also will have more control over the company's digital production manager, an iPad system that controls the sequencing of orders in various channels from cafes, mobile orders and the drive-thru, the company said. Workers will have more flexibility over changing order priority.\n\nStarbucks app expands",

Daniel Acker | Bloomberg | Getty Images\n\nBoeing said Monday that it will buy back its struggling fuselage maker Spirit AeroSystems in an all-stock deal that the plane maker has said will improve safety and quality control. It said it agreed to pay $37.25 a share in Boeing stock for Spirit, giving the plane supplier an equity value of $4.7 billion. Including Spirit's debt the deal has a transaction value of $8.3 billion Boeing said. Spirit's shares closed Friday at $32.87 a share, a market capitalization of about $3.8 billion. Boeing in March disclosed it was in talks to acquire the Wichita, Kansas-based company, weeks after a fuselage panel blew out midair from a nearly new Boeing 737 Max 9 on an Alaska Airlines flight, sparking a fresh crisis for Boeing. Spirit makes the fuselages for the 737 and other parts, including sections of Boeing's 787 Dreamliners. In 2005, Boeing spun off operations in Kansas and Oklahoma that became the present-day Spirit AeroSystems. Boeing accounted for about 70% of Spirit's revenue last year, while roughly a quarter came from making parts for Boeing's main rival, Airbus, according to a securities filing. Boeing CEO Dave Calhoun, who has said he will step down at the end of the year, on Monday said bringing Spirit in-house will \"fully align\" the companies' production systems and workforces.\n\nwatch now\n\n\"Among the many actions we're taking as a company, this is one of the most significant in demonstrating our unwavering commitment to strengthen quality and make certain that Boeing is the company the world needs it to be,\" Calhoun said in a message to employees. He said he expects the deal to close mid-2025, subject to approval by regulators, Spirit shareholders and the sale of Spirit's operations dedicated to Airbus planes. Spirit's CEO, Pat Shanahan, is considered a possible successor for Calhoun. Airbus, meanwhile, said Monday it has reached an agreement with Spirit so that the European aircraft manufacturer is compensated $559 million by Spirit to acquire its manufacturing lines dedicated to Airbus planes. Those include operations in Belfast, Northern Ireland, where the wings and mid-fuselage of the A220 are produced, A220 pylons in Wichita and A350 fuselage sections in North Carolina. Airbus will pay $1 for the assets.\n\nMounting pressure",

Under that agreement, Boeing said it would pay $2.5 billion.\n\nThe DOJ revisited the agreement after a door panel blew out of a new 737 Max 9 midair during an Alaska Airlines flight in January, sparking a new safety and quality control crisis for one of the world's two suppliers of large commercial airplanes.

That system was later implicated in the two crashes.\n\nThe plea deal would require Boeing to pay an additional fine of about $247 million and call for the installation of an outside monitor on Boeing, according to Paul Cassell, one of the lawyers.

A once prolifically successful studio, Pixar has suffered at the box office in the wake of the pandemic. Much of its difficulties have come, in part, because Disney opted to debut a handful of animated features directly on streaming service Disney+ during theatrical closures and even once cinemas had reopened.\n\nAs a result, before \"Inside Out 2,\" no Disney animated feature from Pixar or its Walt Disney Animation studio had generated more than $480 million at the global box office since 2019.\n\n\"Inside Out 2\" has also showcased how vital the family audience is to the box office. This underserved crowd accounted for more than 70% of those in attendance during the film's domestic debut, according to data from EntTelligence.\n\nWhile this audience came out in droves for Universal's \"The Super Mario Bros. Movie,\" which generated more than $1.36 billion at the global box office, there was little for them to feast on until the recent releases of Sony's \"The Garfield Movie\" and Paramount's \"IF.\"\n\n\"Inside Out 2\" also drove the coveted teen demographic to cinemas, with 14% of foot traffic coming from those aged 13 to 17. This younger generation has been largely absent from the market in recent years.\n\nAs the future of moviegoing, this group is particularly important to the industry. Getting them back to the big screen has become a top priority for studios and movie theater operators.\n\nNext up for family and teens is Universal and Illumination's \"Despicable Me 4,\" due out in theaters during the July Fourth holiday weekend.\n\nDisclosure: Comcast is the parent company of NBCUniversal and CNBC.",

        "title": "More companies are staying quiet during Pride, but money is still flowing to LGBTQ+ causes",
        "body": "Parade participants are seen marching during the 2024 Kentuckiana Pride Parade on June 15, 2024 in Louisville, Kentucky. Stephen J. Cohen | Getty Images\n\nPride month is winding down \u2014 and this year, the corporate world took a more cautious approach. June tends to bring a wave of rainbow-themed merchandise and affirming ads and social media posts from retailers and consumers brands, coinciding with parades and other events that celebrate the LGBTQ+ community. As the presidential election approaches, however, some companies have grown quieter about diversity, equity and inclusion efforts to avoid stepping into the culture wars or facing the blowback from conservative customers that Target and Bud Light did a year ago. The starkest example of that came late Thursday: Tractor Supply, a retailer that sells animal feed, cowboy boots and lawn supplies in rural parts of the country, said it is ending all spending tied to diversity and environmental causes. That includes no longer sponsoring Pride festivals, the statement said. The move, while an outlier in its magnitude, underscores how some companies that made inclusion commitments in recent years are treading cautiously. It is difficult to track how many companies shared supportive messages, donated to LGBTQ+ causes or sold rainbow-themed merchandise in June compared to previous years. According to Gravity Research, a Washington, D.C.-based reputational research firm, 45% of Fortune 100 companies had at least one social media post on LinkedIn or X explicitly related to Pride as of June 21 this year, compared with 51% last June. Gravity Research President Luke Hartig said the volatility of the presidential election and the two candidates' willingness to call out companies by name has also made companies less likely to go public about their stand. \"There's a little bit of like, 'keep our heads down while we go through this election,'\" he said. Tim Bennett, cofounder of Tribury Productions, a marketing company that specializes in reaching LGBTQ+ Americans, works with Fortune 500 companies, including recent projects with Procter & Gamble. He said more clients have taken \"a wait-and-see\" approach to marketing to LGBTQ+ consumers or decided to scatter efforts throughout the year instead of making a big splash in a single month. \"June this year has not been like the last five or six,\" Bennett said. That may not be a bad thing for LGBTQ+ initiatives and charities. Sarah Kate Ellis, CEO of nonprofit advocacy group GLAAD, said she's seeing more companies get involved with year-round philanthropy and activism in more meaningful ways. She also pointed to a survey by Gravity Research that found that 78% of companies did not plan to change their Pride strategy this year. Thirteen percent were unsure whether they'd make changes and 9% said they planned to revise their strategy. Gravity Research surveyed 45 corporate executives and Fortune 500 leaders across industries in April. \"The visibility of companies putting flags out and having product to celebrate our Pride and to mark a month that's really significant and important for our community is really important, and I don't want to ever devalue that,\" Ellis said. \"I do think, though, those companies must look inside and make sure that they have the policies and the HR practices that match their outward marketing.\" Major companies are still writing checks for LGBTQ+ causes, too. A GLAAD spokesperson said Friday that the group has not seen donations or corporate support decline this Pride month, though it does not yet have a total tally. On Friday, when the Stonewall National Monument Visitor Center officially opened its doors to commemorate the New York City bar that was a catalyst in the LGBTQ+ rights movement, the event had major backing from the business community. Supporters included Google, Amazon, JPMorgan Chase and Booking.com. President Joe Biden also made an appearance and remarks at the monument's opening.\n\nPride Month merchandise is displayed at a Target store on May 31, 2023 in San Francisco, California. Justin Sullivan | Getty Images\n\nThe Bud Light and Target effect\n\nConsumer staples brands were the most likely to say they planned to shift their Pride month strategy this year, according to Gravity Research's survey. That may stem from the conservative boycotts of Target and Bud Light last year. Target has carried a Pride collection for over a decade. Yet last year, the big-box retailer removed some items and moved displays after employees faced threats. Boycotters targeted items for transgender shoppers, such as \"tuck-friendly\" swimsuits, and also criticized separate Pride merchandise for kids. Instead of putting Pride merchandise in all stores this year, Target only carried it in the locations that accounted for 90% of total Pride sales in 2022 and 2023. It also stopped selling any Pride apparel for kids. On the company's website and in those select stores, shoppers can find a wide variety of Pride-themed items. The volume of negative feedback to the Pride collection externally and internally is \"significantly lower\" this year than in 2023, according to a Target spokesperson. In a statement, Target said it is \"committed to supporting the LGBTQIA+ community during Pride Month and year-round\" and would participate in Pride events across the country and support LGBTQ+ groups, in addition to offering Pride products.\n\nA sign disparaging Bud Light beer is seen along a country road on April 21, 2023 in Arco, Idaho. Anheuser-Busch, the brewer of Bud Light has faced backlash after the company sponsored two Instagram posts from a transgender woman. Natalie Behring | Getty Images\n\nAnheuser-Busch InBev and other large beer brands, on the other hand, have backed away from public support of the LGBTQ+ community. Conservatives like singer Kid Rock and Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis called for a boycott of the beer and its parent company, Anheuser-Busch InBev, after Bud Light sent personalized cans of its beer to transgender influencer Dylan Mulvaney. The marketing campaign coincided with the March Madness college basketball tournament. Bud Light sales tumbled around 25%, and the brand lost its spot as the best-selling beer in the U.S., ceding the position it held for more than two decades to Constellation Brands' Modelo. AB InBev distanced itself from Mulvaney and fired Bud Light's vice president of marketing. In October, AB InBev CEO Michel Doukeris said the brand would focus its marketing more on events like sports games and concerts. It also returned as the official sponsor of the UFC. In recent months, some consumers have returned to Bud Light, as RBC Europe analysts estimate that the brand's U.S. volume is down only about 10% these days. For its part, Bud Light hasn't posted in support of Pride month on its Instagram or X pages this year. The boycott was unusually sticky for a few reasons, according to Neil Reid, a geography professor at the University of Toledo who researches the beer industry. Studies have shown that consumers' loyalty to top-selling beers may be more tied to the brand than the taste, Reid said. Right-wing news outlets like Fox News also devoted plenty of airtime to the controversy, stretching its duration and potentially reaching new consumers who missed the initial reaction. Plus, once Bud Light sales fell, retailers gave more shelf space to its rivals. \"You can look at this issue from a moral, ethical perspective or you can also look at it from a pure business perspective. Those two often don't result in the same strategy,\" Reid said.\n\nThe New York Stock Exchange welcomes e.l.f.

        "title": "Fathom, the company behind classic films at your local theater, is making major gains in moviegoing",
        "body": "At a time when the box office is starved for content and audiences seem pickier than ever, Fathom Events is posting record revenue gains.\n\nFor 20 years, the joint venture between AMC , Regal and Cinemark has been best known for bringing alternative content to the big screen in the form of classic Hollywood titles, live telecasts of theater and opera productions, concerts and even television series.\n\nMost recently, it ventured into the specialty distribution space to deliver \"The Blind,\" \"The Chosen,\" \"Jesus Thirsts: The Miracle of the Eucharist\" and \"Waitress: the Musical\" to audiences. Still to come is \"Andrea Bocelli 30: The Celebration.\"\n\nIn 2023, Fathom generated $100 million at the box office, a 116% increase over 2019 levels and its highest-grossing year ever. And that momentum has continued into 2024, as the company tallied $43 million in the first quarter, up nearly 140% compared to the $18 million it tallied in the year-earlier period.\n\nFathom's relationships with Hollywood's biggest studios and its cinematic reach \u2014 as the partnership of the industry's three biggest theater chains \u2014 has made it a formidable force at the box office. Its value proposition is twofold: It breathes new life into older films, and into theaters.\n\n\"Falling mostly under the event film banner, anniversary titles have truly come into vogue seemingly more so now than in years past with a particular emphasis given to these beloved older films,\" said Paul Dergarabedian, senior media analyst at Comscore. \"These anniversary re-releases are a win-win, providing joy to movie fans and notably additional revenues to movie theaters often decades after initial theatrical run.\"\n\nIn post-pandemic times, Fathom has acted as a crutch for many smaller cinema operators, providing much-needed content for the big screen amid a drought caused by pandemic and strike-related production shutdowns.\n\nSeason 4 of \"The Chosen,\" a faith-based television show about the life of Jesus, generated $32 million at the box office for Fathom, around 75% of its first-quarter haul.\n\n\"'The Chosen' was through [Fathom], and it was huge for us,\" said Brock Bagby, president and chief content, programming and development officer at B&B Theatres. \"It gave us a lot of extra revenue in February and the beginning of March that we wouldn't have had.\"\n\nFathom has also benefited from its anniversary titles and classic cinema showings. Each year, the company brings films back to theaters to celebrate milestone years alongside fan-favorite titles.\n\n\"We've seen that there's a growing segment in the box office, people that are interested in seeing older films on the big screen,\" said Jordan Hohman, vice president of project development at Phoenix Theatres. \"These audiences are getting to enjoy classic films, either for the first time or for the first time, in a new way. I think that that's valuable.\"\n\nThis year, the company celebrated the 85th anniversaries of \"The Wizard of Oz\" and \"Gone with the Wind\" as well as the 35th anniversary of \"Steel Magnolias.\" Still on the calendar is the 50th anniversary of \"Blazing Saddles,\" the 70th anniversary of Alfred Hitchcock's \"Rear Window,\" the 40th anniversary of \"Neverending Story\" and the 20th anniversary of \"Mean Girls.\"\n\nIt also has a film series called Studio Ghibli Fest, which features 14 films from the studio in their original Japanese and English dubbed versions. This year, the lineup boasts the 20th anniversary of \"Howl's Moving Castle,\" the 35th anniversary of \"Kiki's Delivery Service\" and the 30th anniversary of \"Pom Poko.\"\n\nAnd these titles can generate big box-office hauls even decades after they were first released.\n\nFathom's three-weekend run of the original Lord of the Rings trilogy resulted in $8.2 million at the box office.\n\n\"Lord of the Rings was wildly successful nationwide, and for us,\" Bagby said. \"We just did 4DX Lord of the Rings this weekend in our new Dallas theater, and we sold out every single show.\"\n\n4DX is a screen format that utilizes motion seats, practical effects and sensory elements to immerse viewers in a movie experience.\n\nAudiences are already buying tickets for showings in August celebrating the 15th anniversary of \"Coraline,\" which will be shown widely in 3D for the first time since its original release.\n\nFathom re-released \"Coraline\" twice before with great success. In 2022, the film showed in 800 theaters for one day and tallied $1.2 million in ticket sales. Last year, the film extended its release to five days and snared $7.1 million, making it the highest-grossing classic film release in Fathom history.\n\nThat $7.1 million figure is about 10% of the initial domestic run for \"Coraline\" in 2009 and 42% of its opening weekend, according to data from Comscore.\n\nWhat's more, 53% of the audience who attended screenings of the film last year were 34 years old or younger.\n\n\"New audiences are seeing it for the first time although the film is 15 years old,\" said Ray Nutt, CEO of Fathom Events.\n\nFathom reports presales for this year's screenings of \"Coraline\" are selling seven times as many tickets per location as were sold during the same period last year, with two-thirds of those ticket sales for the 3D version of the film.\n\nBecause Fathom has a wide footprint through its parent companies and nationwide marketing, it does the heavy lifting for smaller theater chains.\n\n\"[Fathom has] built a lot of relationships,\" Phoenix Theatre's Hohman said. \"They worked out the licensing and they created the marketing behind re-releasing these classic films that, you know, we just can't do ourselves. It's a national campaign. So, I think that they just offer a lot of value.\"",

        "body": "In this article F\n\nGM\n\nSTLA Follow your favorite stocks CREATE FREE ACCOUNT\n\nGM launched 'EV Live,' a free online platform that connects electric vehicle owners or consumers who have questions about zero-emissions cars and trucks with an expert who can answer them. Courtesy: GM\n\nDETROIT \u2014 Purchasing a vehicle has never been that easy. But shoppers entering traditional dealer showrooms for the foreseeable future may have a new challenge: An alphabet soup of \"electrified\" vehicle offerings. As all-electric vehicle adoption crawls along in the U.S., automakers are increasingly releasing various hybrid vehicles as alternative options to EVs and traditional gas-powered engines. A variety of models means more customer choice, but also more complexity for automakers and consumers, many of whom are returning to the new vehicle market for the first time in years following unprecedented supply chain shortages and record used vehicle prices. \"More choice in the marketplace is good for consumers, but only if they understand the differences,\" said Paul Waatti, director of industry analysis at AutoPacific. \"There needs to be more clarity on what the terms and acronyms actually mean, and what the potential benefits and drawbacks are.\" A car shopper today has their pick of traditional internal combustion engine (ICE) vehicles; mild-hybrid electric vehicles (MHEVs); hybrid electric vehicles (HEVs); plug-in hybrid electric vehicles (PHEVs); fuel cell electric vehicles (FCEVs) and battery-electric vehicles (BEVs), also commonly known as EVs. Also coming later this year from Stellantis : range-extended electric vehicles (REEVs) that are similar to plug-in hybrid vehicles but can exclusively function as an EV, with its electric motors powered by a gas engine. Each type of vehicle may be better for a different kind of customer. All except EVs and fuel-cell vehicles continue to offer a traditional internal combustion engine combined with \"electrified\" technologies such as a battery or motor to assist in performance or fuel economy. Heather Seymour, of St. Johns, Florida, said she did quite a bit of research prior to purchasing a 2022 Jeep Wrangler Rubicon plug-in hybrid electric vehicle, known as a 4xe model. \"I knew I wanted to kind of dip my toe in the water of the hybrids. I wasn't ready to go full electric, so the plug-in was definitely of interest to me,\" said Seymour, who said she typically uses the all-electric range of the SUV, except on longer trips. \"The more we learned about it, the more we figured out what we wanted.\"\n\nEV naming\n\nWhile consumers may not need to know every acronym or technology to find their right model, automakers aren't exactly helping the situation with their consumer-facing naming. For example, Hyundai's Genesis brand calls its all-electric vehicles \"electrified,\" while many others reserve that term for hybrids. Chrysler's Pacifica minivan is a plug-in hybrid labeled as a regular \"hybrid,\" and Toyota markets some of its traditional hybrids as \"hybrid EVs.\" Stellantis says its REEV vehicles are not PHEVs, despite operating similarly. \"Every automaker is using different terms. There's no standardization, and that causes some confusion on the consumer side,\" Waatti said.\n\nGM's 2024 Chevrolet Equinox EV (right) next to a gas-powered Chevy Equinox on May 16, 2024 in Detroit. Michael Wayland / CNBC\n\nSome automakers such as General Motors also use traditional nameplates such as the Chevrolet Blazer and Equinox for new EVs that share little to nothing with their gas-powered counterparts other than the name. Stellantis' Jeep also uses the \"Wagoneer\" moniker for two large gas-powered SUVs as well as a smaller, all-electric Wagoneer \"S\" SUV. Jeep CEO Antonio Filosa has said he isn't worried about any confusion, as the brand has a strong naming heritage and customers can decide which vehicle is best for their needs. \"I believe that we need education, but after education we have a lot of choices for the consumer,\" he said during a recent interview. \"It's all for the benefit of the consumer. They will have a lot of flexibility.\"\n\nEducation is key\n\nOne thing automotive executives from Japan and South Korea to Detroit and Germany can agree on is the need for consumer education. Whether vehicles are electrified or all-electric, they're critical for automakers to meet tightening emissions and fuel economy targets as well as to build production scale, reduce prices and increase profits. \"We don't want to force a customer to do something they're not ready for,\" Kia America VP of Marketing Russell Wager told CNBC earlier this year. \"We're trying our best to educate them.\"\n\n2024 Jeep Wagoneer S EV Jeep\n\nKia and its dealers have put out myth-busting pages online to answer concerns or frequently asked questions about EVs and hybrids. They range from technical questions about batteries to practical questions like whether you can go through a car wash in an EV (you can). GM has taken it a step further. The Detroit automaker launched \"EV Live\" in 2022. It's an online video platform, now known as \"GM Energy Live,\" that allows participants to interact one-on-one with EV specialists and learn about electric vehicles and charging. Ford Motor recently launched its own video-based training program, geared toward its more than 3,000 U.S. franchised dealers to improve customer service, better engage employees and provide dealers and the company with more data to help in selling the vehicles. Auto executives say it's up to the companies as well as their dealers to be trained and educated about the benefits of the vehicles, whatever they may be. \"Each customer, in the end, is very different,\" said J\u00e9r\u00e9mie Papin, chair of Nissan Americas, earlier this year. \"I think it's what the vehicle can do for them,\" not necessarily how the technology works, he said.\n\nAutomotive alphabet soup The automotive industry has more powertrain and \"propulsion\" options than ever before. Here's a breakdown: Internal combustion engine (ICE): A \"traditional\" vehicle with an engine that's fueled with gasoline or diesel.\n\nA \"traditional\" vehicle with an engine that's fueled with gasoline or diesel.

Plug-in hybrid electric vehicle (PHEV) : These vehicles feature an internal combustion engine combined with a hybrid system, including a larger battery than traditional hybrid vehicles as well as a plug to recharge the vehicle's battery. They typically allow drivers to travel a certain number of miles using the battery before the engine is needed to power the car or truck.\n\n: These vehicles feature an internal combustion engine combined with a hybrid system, including a larger battery than traditional hybrid vehicles as well as a plug to recharge the vehicle's battery.

Range-extended electric vehicles (REEV): These are an emerging technology that largely function as a PHEV, however after the battery runs out of energy to power the vehicle, an engine works as a generator to exclusively power electric motors. The vehicle still drives like an EV instead of having the engine directly power the vehicle's motion.\n\nConsumer adoption",

        "body": "The budding trends in food sound like a return to the diet of cavemen: Fish is the hottest protein, honey is the flavor du jour and game meat is an upgrade to charcuterie boards. That's according to the hundreds of items on display at the Summer Fancy Food Show, a trade show hosted by the Specialty Food Association that has gained a reputation as a place to spot the next big flavors, foods and drinks that will dominate menus and grocery store shelves. The annual show returned to the Jacob K. Javits Convention Center in New York this week, running Sunday through Tuesday. More than 2,400 companies exhibited their foods and drinks for attendees, which include restaurant operators, specialty food retailers and trendspotters. Past show trends that are making their way to mainstream consumers' palettes include yuzu, mushrooms and sophisticated alcohol substitutes. Previous shows have also been a springboard for small brands seeking a wider audience. Honest Tea, Ben & Jerry's and Tate's Bake Shop are among the companies that attended the show in their early days on their way to becoming well-known consumer brands now owned by the industry's biggest players. Here are some highlights from this year's Summer Fancy Food Show:\n\nHoney \u2014 as a flavor\n\nOwl Creek Organics & Natural Products' lineup of honey spreads at the Summer Fancy Foods Show Amelia Lucas | CNBC\n\nHumans have been eating honey for thousands of years, but it's taking center stage as a flavor with some food and beverage makers. In the SFA's preliminary report on the show, its trendspotters called out honey, noting its health benefits. Honey was the star in both foods and drinks across the show. Green Bee showed off its honey soda, which includes a Honeycomb Cider flavor. Owl Creek Organics & Natural Flavors displayed honey spreads, with flavors ranging from caffe mocha to lemon poppyseed. And Dutch company Klepper & Klepper used honey as a flavor for their licorice.\n\nTinned fish\n\nKrill Arctic Foods' tinned krill meat Amelia Lucas | CNBC\n\nIn years past, tinned fish was relegated primarily to booths in the Spanish and Portuguese pavilions. But this year, exhibitors showed off their tinned fish products across the show floor. TikTok helped fuel the tinned fish trend last year, boosting sales of canned sardines. Now specialty food companies are responding. This isn't the canned tuna of yore. There are more flavors, different seafood varieties and trendier packaging. Wildfish Cannery, an Alaska-based company that was founded in 1987, showed off a new retro design for its sockeye salmon, giving it a more upscale feel. Krill Arctic Foods exhibited its canned krill meat, which may lack the same curb appeal on its packaging but boasts about the food's nutritional profile.\n\nFish to go\n\nAcme Smoked Fish's Lox in a Box kits on display at the company's booth Amelia Lucas | CNBC\n\nExhibitors also showed off new ways to eat fish on the go, hoping to capitalize on consumers' desire for convenience and more protein in their diets. The association named \"satisfying snacks\" as one of the trends that it's been watching. Acme Smoked Fish highlighted its new Lox in a Box snack kits, available with cream cheese or avocado. Legend of Master International, an Asian food supplier, sampled its Kani fish cake sticks, made to eat like string cheese or for cooking.\n\nUpgraded charcuterie\n\nFossil Farms' array of salami flavors, including lamb and bison Amelia Lucas | CNBC\n\nLike tinned fish, the popularity of charcuterie boards owes a lot to social media, where users can dazzle their followers with elaborate displays of preserved meats, cheeses and fruit. Companies at the Summer Fancy Food Show showed off some new options to level up the charcuterie \u2014 especially the salami. Tempesta Artisan Salumi offered up black truffle-flavored salami, while Salt & Twine's selection included a mezcal and salted lime flavor. But exhibitors weren't just having fun with the flavors. Some are looking beyond pork to make the cured meat. Driftless Provisions' salami uses elk, venison and bison alongside pork. Fossil Farms' salami lineup included lamb and wagyu beef.\n\nPairing snacks\n\nWine Chips' Sel Gris-flavored chips are meant to be paired with sparkling wines Amelia Lucas | CNBC",

Instead, Bandit Running offers Olympic hopefuls the all-black kits and warmups \u2014 along with short-term endorsement deals.\n\nBandit co-founder Tim West said the company is giving out at least 35 two-week deals for unsponsored runners at the trials, a U.S. Olympian's gateway into the four-year games. The deals consist of unbranded apparel, a platform and cash to cover expenses. Last year, Bandit partnered with nine athletes.\n\n\"We're really hoping for a new sponsorship model where brands take a healthy piece of their budget and apply it to the kind of amateur, sub-elite athlete to help grow the sport. I think when you lift up, sort of the bottom, everything pushes up,\" West told CNBC.\n\nBandit's deals have a built-in release clause, West said, allowing an easy out for athletes who get a traditional sponsorship offer during the trials.\n\nGiven the high prices associated with competing, West said unsponsored athletes are \"investing in themselves,\" posing an opportunity for brands to step in and help out.\n\nAnd, the all-black, logo-free kits help call attention to which athletes may be available to strike a longer-term deal.\n\nAmong them is Courtney Okolo, a 400-meter runner.\n\nAfter winning a gold medal in the 2016 Rio Olympics and being sponsored by Nike for four years, Okolo, 30, is embracing the Unsponsored Project.

        "body": "In this article PFE Follow your favorite stocks CREATE FREE ACCOUNT\n\nKena Betancur | Corbis News | Getty Images\n\nPfizer had a \"phenomenal\" first quarter \u2014 and Wall Street took notice, CEO Albert Bourla told thousands of employees during a companywide town hall on May 2, according to a recording heard by CNBC. A day earlier, the pharmaceutical giant's stock had closed 6% higher after its quarterly results topped analyst estimates and it hiked its full-year outlook. It was a far cry from the year prior, when Pfizer's shares plunged more than 40%, making it one of the worst-performing large pharmaceutical stocks of 2023. Its market cap of about $157 billion is now less than half of its 2021 peak of nearly $350 billion. Few companies benefited from the pandemic as much as Pfizer did. The drugmaker's profits boomed, fueled by its Covid vaccine and antiviral pill Paxlovid. After Pfizer and German company BioNTech rapidly developed and deployed a lifesaving shot that helped the world emerge from the pandemic, Pfizer drew widespread praise. Pfizer's success contributed to its equally jarring fall from grace. When the virus receded in 2023, its Covid products revenue plummeted. The world, which hailed Pfizer as a pandemic hero a few years earlier, no longer needed the company in the same way. Pfizer may be on its way toward stabilizing its business and winning back Wall Street's favor after the strong first quarter. But the company is struggling to balance that with the fears of its employees, some of whom said they feel uncertain about their future and unmotivated after the sudden reversal of fortune. In October Pfizer launched a multibillion-dollar cost-cutting program, slashing research and development spending and laying off hundreds of employees \u2014 including in the once-lauded Covid vaccine unit. In May the company said it's on track to deliver $4 billion in savings by the end of the year.\n\nStock Chart Icon Stock chart icon Pfizer's stock surged after it rolled out its Covid vaccine and antiviral treatment, then plunged when the company's Covid revenue started to drop.\n\nNow, as Pfizer appears poised to turn a corner, the company is trying to boost employee morale to match Wall Street's optimism. CNBC spoke with 11 current and former Pfizer employees \u2014 all of whom asked to remain anonymous for fear of retaliation \u2014 about Pfizer's dizzying climb, rapid decline and turnaround strategy. The company's seesawing fortunes have fueled uncertainty within Pfizer's workforce. Most of the current and former employees CNBC spoke with called Pfizer a good place to work, and some current employees said they feel optimistic about the direction of the company after the first quarter. But other current employees are dissatisfied with where the strategy shift has left them. Some cited higher workloads after teams were stretched thin by budget cuts, a return-to-office policy they said has forced out some remote workers, and doubts about how the business will perform moving forward. The company's separate multiyear cost-cutting program announced in May is also stoking fears about the potential for new U.S. layoffs, according to some current workers. Some employees working in certain manufacturing and supply chain divisions, which they believe are likely to be affected by the cuts, described having low morale and motivation to work. Meanwhile, several former Pfizer employees, most of whom were laid off over the last six months or left voluntarily, said they're unhappy with how the company handled cost cuts in 2023. Some alleged that Pfizer management provided little transparency around the layoffs and seemed more focused on the company's stock performance than its staff throughout the process. During the latest town hall, Bourla told employees that layoffs in the U.S. have been completed but that more are occurring internationally. He called the job cuts \"very, very painful\" and said it was \"killing\" him to let employees go. But he also acknowledged that Wall Street likes the cuts. \"And, of course, I'm very concerned with everyone that could be affected and impacted by that, but it works,\" Bourla said, according to the recording. \"And we saw it, how the Street will respond.\" A Pfizer spokesperson said reducing costs will \"put us on strong footing towards margin expansion and improved financial returns moving forward.\" The spokesperson added that cutting expenses is one of Pfizer's five priorities for the year, along with maximizing the performance of new products, innovating its drug pipeline, growing its oncology business with its acquisition of cancer drugmaker Seagen, and allocating capital to increase its dividend, reduce outstanding debt and reinvest in the business. To cut costs, apart from layoffs the company is trimming its drug portfolio and direct marketing spending, shrinking its real estate footprint and reducing its investment in Covid, among other efforts, said the spokesperson. The spokesperson said Pfizer does not take the layoffs \"lightly\" and that the company is \"focused on providing our impacted colleagues with the resources and compassion they deserve.\"\n\nWhat went wrong in 2023\n\nPfizer entered 2023 on a high. The company had just capped a record-breaking 2022 with $100 billion in sales, more than half of which came from its Covid vaccines and Paxlovid. Employee morale at Pfizer was relatively high at the time, some current and former workers told CNBC. The company had gone on a hiring spree and piled money into different projects, they said. The success came with trade-offs. Two former employees involved in developing the Covid vaccine manufacturing process said they were experiencing burnout at the start of 2023. In January 2023, Pfizer forecast a steep drop in annual revenue, to between $67 billion and $71 billion. That outlook included $13.5 billion and $8 billion in sales of Covid vaccines and Paxlovid, respectively. But it could not predict at the time just how much revenue would dry up.\n\nPfizer's Covid vaccine Comirnaty, seen at a CVS Pharmacy in Eagle Rock, California, Sept. 14, 2023. Irfan Khan | Los Angeles Times | Getty Images\n\nDuring an earnings call that same month, Pfizer executives said they expected roughly 24% of the U.S. population to get an annual Covid booster in 2023. But by December, only around 17% of U.S. adults had received the new Covid shots from Pfizer and Moderna, according to data from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Many Americans who got previous Covid shots felt they did not need more protection because the threat of the virus had diminished, according to recent surveys. Meanwhile, use of Paxlovid in the U.S. was dented by reductions in Covid testing and infection rates, and by doctors' concerns about interactions with common medications, among other factors. As demand plummeted, the federal government returned millions of the antiviral treatment courses to Pfizer. In January this year, however, Pfizer said fewer courses were returned by the end of 2023 than it had expected. The company soon acknowledged the challenges its Covid business faced towards the end of 2023. In October, Pfizer said it slashed both ends of its 2023 sales guidance by around $9 billion \"solely due to its Covid products.\" At the same time, Pfizer started to cut costs. The company still hasn't said how many employees it laid off, though it reduced staff around the world. Pfizer's 2023 revenue ultimately came in at $58.5 billion, including $11.22 billion from its Covid vaccine and $1.28 billion from Paxlovid. The end of the year brought other challenges for Pfizer: The company scrapped the twice-daily version of its experimental weight loss drug, danuglipron, and saw slower uptake for a newly launched RSV vaccine in the U.S. than competitor GSK saw with its own version. After the string of difficulties, investors showed relief when Pfizer announced the cost cuts. But for many employees, the shift in post-pandemic strategy was a nightmare, they told CNBC. During a conference in January, Bourla acknowledged that 2023 was a rough year for the company and its stock price. But he said Pfizer took steps to start 2024 with a \"clean slate.\" Those included renegotiating multibillion-dollar Covid contracts with the EU and other governments, transitioning its Covid products to the commercial market in several countries and writing off unused stock of its vaccine and Paxlovid. \"So it's not simple, how many people will use the vaccine. There were a lot of things we had to remove\" he said. Bourla also touted Pfizer's portfolio of new products that it said will boost sales, including nine new product approvals in the U.S. last year and a pipeline of drugs that could bring in more future revenue. Pfizer has also repeatedly said that the Seagen deal brings a proven antibody-drug conjugate platform that enhances its commercial structure and could help the company become a \"world-class oncology leader.\" Pfizer has said Seagen could contribute more than $10 billion in risk-adjusted sales by 2030 with its targeted cancer therapies. Those revenue streams would help Pfizer prepare for upcoming patent expirations for blockbuster drugs, including its breast cancer treatment Ibrance, and Eliquis, a blood thinner it shares with Bristol Myers Squibb .\n\nA 'slap in the face'\n\nSome current and former employees said they knew early in 2023 that wide-scale layoffs were possible. Those people alleged that Pfizer has long had a culture of hiring too many people and later laying many employees off \u2014 a cycle seen at many other large companies. Pfizer wasn't the only Covid-boom company whose business declined. Biotech company Moderna 's revenue from its Covid shot also plunged in 2023. Companies outside the pharmaceutical industry that flourished in 2020, including fitness firm Peloton and digital meeting platform Zoom , also struggled to adjust as people returned to their pre-pandemic lives. Other drugmakers big and small are still downsizing and restructuring their workforces. Big pharmaceutical companies, such as Bristol Myers Squibb, are trying to conserve cash as they could lose revenue from upcoming drug patent expirations and Medicare drug price negotiations, among other threats. Biotech companies are also working to stay afloat after a rough 2023 marked by rising interest rates, a poor deal market and a lack of fundraising. At Pfizer, there were other warnings of trouble ahead, according to current and former employees: a small round of layoffs during the first quarter of 2023 and budget restrictions that limited travel, team lunch outings and purchases of new lab and manufacturing equipment. Pfizer's announcement in March 2023 that it would acquire Seagen for a whopping $43 billion was another sign, according to some current and former employees. While most of the 11 workers acknowledged that the deal made sense for Pfizer's growth, they said the hefty price tag at a time when Covid sales had already started to decline left them uneasy. Still, a few former employees said they felt blindsided by the company's decision to let go of staff, saying they were relatively optimistic about the business before the October cost-cut announcement. One former employee who worked at a site focused on gene therapies in Durham, North Carolina, said they were repeatedly told their job would be safe \u2014 even as Pfizer divested much of its early stage portfolio for those treatments at the start of 2023. The company confirmed with news outlets in October that it would close that site and lay off an undisclosed number of staff. Notably, Pfizer's layoffs also affected some workers involved in the research, development and manufacturing of the company's Covid vaccine, according to some current and former employees. They said those workers, whom Pfizer celebrated as pandemic heroes just a year earlier, felt especially betrayed by the cuts. \"It felt like we were tossed out the door when they no longer needed us,\" said one former employee who worked on the vaccine.\n\nPfizer CEO Albert Bourla speaks during a press conference after a visit to oversee the production of the Pfizer-BioNtech Covid-19 vaccine at the Pfizer factory in Puurs, Belgium, April 23, 2021. John Thys | Reuters\n\nAll the current and former employees who spoke with CNBC said they believed the company handled the layoffs and the months leading up to them poorly. Some workers said they were disappointed with what they called higher management's lack of transparency around the layoffs. Some also questioned why Pfizer did not set more realistic expectations for its Covid business earlier, especially as cases and public concern about the virus diminished in the U.S. On Oct. 17, just a few days after Pfizer publicly announced its cost-cutting program to investors, executives held a companywide town hall with Pfizer's more than 80,000-person workforce that one worker described as \"disastrous\" and another called a \"slap in the face.\" On the town hall, Bourla and Pfizer Chief Human Experience Officer Payal Sahni Becher acknowledged the company's Covid business was struggling but said it was positioning for growth with the cost cuts, according to some current and former employees. Those people said the executives addressed the looming layoffs during the town hall but provided scant details on how many workers, teams or sites they would affect, when they would occur or how the company decided who would lose their jobs. Many workers also alleged that Bourla and Becher were too casual during the town hall, cracking light jokes and chuckling at some of the questions asked by staff, such as one about employee bonuses.\n\nReturn-to-office policies\n\nOn top of layoffs, return-to-office policies launched in 2023 forced out some workers in fully remote roles, some current and former employees said. Those people said some fully remote employees had their virtual work status revoked and were asked to start working in person at their site starting on a certain date under the new mandates. While some workers were asked to come in only two or three days a week, even that was impossible for staff members who lived too far from their sites, according to the employees. Some remote workers who did not comply over time were let go, the current and former employees said. A Pfizer spokesperson did not confirm or provide any details about its recent return-to-office policies. \"The return to office has been possibly the worst managed factor in all of this,\" one current employee said.\n\nPeople pass by the Pfizer headquarters building in New York City, Jan. 29, 2023. Kena Betancur | View Press | Corbis News | Getty Images\n\nThose policies also applied to workers who were relocated from recently closed facilities, according to some employees. For example, Pfizer in October said it would shut down its office in Peapack, New Jersey in 2024, which affected nearly 800 workers. The company first announced those plans in 2021. Pfizer told news outlets that the majority of employees would be relocated to its headquarters in New York City. For one employee, a 15-minute commute to work became closer to an hour-and-a-half trip. During another town hall, on Oct. 26, Pfizer Chief Global Supply Officer Mike McDermott said the decision to close the Peapack site \"wasn't made lightly.\" But he said having Peapack employees work in person at the company's headquarters was \"right for Pfizer's culture,\" according to a recording heard by CNBC. He said the company isn't taking away remote work as an option. Pfizer leadership has been vocal about asking employees to work in person again. \"Teleconferencing is simply no substitute for the personal interaction that makes it possible to share ideas, build connection, or even agree to disagree,\" Bourla said during the APEC CEO Summit in November. Pfizer is just one of several companies across different industries to push for in-person work again after the pandemic. Tech giants such as Google similarly reversed course on remote work in 2023 after offering flexibility to employees throughout Covid, reportedly frustrating workers.\n\nEmployee morale\n\nEmployee morale plummeted in the months after the October layoff announcement, according to current and former employees. Some of those people said they were unmotivated to work with their job security in question, while one worker described \"walking on eggshells\" for weeks out of fear that they would lose their job. Other employees said they were stretched thin due to understaffing and a lack of other resources. A few workers said they struggled to keep up with abrupt internal changes, such as being assigned to new managers or being moved onto different teams. Some current employees said Pfizer has held several so-called transparency meetings, which allow workers to anonymously ask questions and provide feedback to senior leadership. Faith in executive leadership also plunged among some workers, according to most of the current and former employees who spoke with CNBC. Some employees acknowledged that executives have a duty to care about their company's stock price but said that Bourla and other officials appeared to be hyper-focused on Pfizer shares even as people lost their jobs. Some current workers said that hasn't appeared to change after the town hall on May 2. Others said Bourla's remarks were encouraging and sounded far more genuine.\n\nPeople pass by the Pfizer headquarters building on January 29, 2023 in New York City.

        "summary": "But other current employees are dissatisfied with where the strategy shift has left them.\nIn January 2023, Pfizer forecast a steep drop in annual revenue, to between $67 billion and $71 billion.\nPfizer's 2023 revenue ultimately came in at $58.5 billion, including $11.22 billion from its Covid vaccine and $1.28 billion from Paxlovid.\nFaith in executive leadership also plunged among some workers, according to most of the current and former employees who spoke with CNBC.\nSome current workers said that hasn't appeared to change after the town hall on May 2.",

        "body": "In this article NKE Follow your favorite stocks CREATE FREE ACCOUNT\n\nJohn Donahoe, attends the first day of the annual Allen & Company Sun Valley Conference, in Sun Valley, Idaho. Drew Angerer | Getty Images\n\nNike CEO John Donahoe appears to be on thin ice. The former top executive of eBay , who has been at the helm of Nike since January 2020, is starting to lose Wall Street's confidence after the company capped off a lackluster fiscal year with more bad news. On Thursday, Nike warned that sales in its current quarter were expected to decline by a staggering 10% \u2013 far worse than the 3.2% drop LSEG had projected \u2013 after it posted its slowest annual sales gain in 14 years, excluding the Covid-19 pandemic. The company also said it expects fiscal 2025 sales to be down mid-single digits when it previously expected them to grow. The warning signs led shares to close 20% lower on Friday -- making it the worst trading day in the company's history since its IPO in Dec. 1980. The plunge wiped about $28 billion off of Nike's market cap, bringing it to just under $114 billion from $142 billion a day earlier. As Wall Street digested the dismal outlook from the world's largest sportswear company, at least six investment banks downgraded Nike's stock. Analysts at Morgan Stanley and Stifel took it a step further, specifically calling the company's management into question. \"The FY25 guide (the 5th downward consensus revision in 6 quarters), pushes prospects for growth inflection further into 2025 (perhaps FY4Q or spring '25 at the earliest) asking investors to both underwrite success of not yet proven styles and look across an uncertain consumer discretionary backdrop into 2HCY24 until momentum could build again into 2HCY25,\" wrote Stifel analyst Jim Duffy. \"Management credibility is severely challenged and potential for C-level regime change adds further uncertainty.\"\n\nStock Chart Icon Stock chart icon Nike stock has underperformed the S&P 500 during CEO John Donahoe's tenure.\n\nSince Donahoe took over as Nike's top executive, its stock is down more than 25% as of Friday's close, significantly underperforming both the S&P 500 and the XRT \u2013 the retail-focused ETF \u2013 which saw gains of around 67% and 66% in that time period, respectively. Nike finance chief Matt Friend on Thursday attributed the guidance cut to a host of factors. Some, like softness in China and challenging foreign exchange headwinds, are outside of Nike's control, but others are problems it squarely created under Donahoe's leadership. The company is expecting wholesale orders to be slow as it scales new styles, pulls back on classic franchises and works to repair its relationships with key retail partners after spending the last few years cutting them off in favor of a direct-selling strategy. At the same time, loyal customers who shop on Nike's website are no longer springing for new pairs of Air Force 1s, Air Jordan 1s or Dunks, the company's core franchises. Critics say the sneaker lines have dominated the retailer's offerings for too long and turned customers away as they sought fresh styles and innovative designs from a slew of upstart competitors. That's left Nike to win back some of its most essential customers \u2013 runners. As the retailer focused on its direct-selling strategy at the expense of innovation, scrappy competitors like On Running and Hoka snatched up market share.",

Boeing's crew flight test represents the first time Starliner is carrying people, flying NASA astronauts Butch Wilmore and Suni Williams.\n\nOfficials say the Starliner team is starting a test campaign of the spacecraft's thruster technology at White Sands, New Mexico \u2014 testing that will be completed before Starliner returns to Earth.\n\n\"We think the testing could take a couple of weeks.

        "body": "An electric Ford truck is displayed during the Electrify Expo D.C. in Washington, D.C., on July 23, 2023.\n\nFord Motor expects to introduce a $30,000 all-electric vehicle that will be profitable in roughly two and a half years, CEO Jim Farley said Friday during the Aspen Ideas Festival.\n\nFarley did not release many other details about the vehicle, which is being developed by a Ford \"skunkworks\" team, but said its main competitors are expected to be Chinese automakers such as BYD and an anticipated entry-level car from U.S. EV leader Tesla .\n\nFarley said Ford is first focusing on smaller EVs instead of larger all-electric trucks and SUVs, which have historically been gas-powered profit engines for the company, because such vehicles are \"never going to make money.\"\n\n\"You have to make a radical change as an [automaker] to get to a profitable EV. The first thing we have to do is really put all of our capital toward smaller, more affordable EVs,\" Farley said during an interview with CNBC's Julia Boorstin. \"That's the duty cycle that we've now found that really matches. These big, huge, enormous EVs, they're never going to make money. The battery is $50,000. \u2026 The batteries will never be affordable.\"\n\nA Ford spokesman later clarified Farley was referring to large vehicles such as the company's Super Duty models or vehicles that require massive battery packs to achieve significant EV ranges of 500 miles. He was not referring to ones such as Ford's current all-electric F-150 Lightning pickup or next-generation EVs.\n\nFord earlier this year said it was postponing production of a large three-row SUV at a plant in Canada to 2027 from its initial plan of 2025. It also postponed a next-generation pickup, codenamed \"T3,\" from late 2025 to 2026.\n\nFarley on Friday reiterated Ford's next-generation vehicles would be profitable.\n\nHe also said Americans need to \"get back in love\" with small cars instead of larger ones, a surprising statement given a majority or Ford's profits come from trucks and considering American carmakers have historically had trouble making money on small models.\n\n\"We have to start to get back in love with smaller vehicles. It's super important for our society and for EV adoption,\" Farley said Friday. \"We are just in love with these monster vehicles, and I love them too, but it's a major issue with weight.\"\n\nFord's EV unit lost $1.32 billion during the first quarter of this year on 10,000 vehicles wholesaled. While the unit also includes EV-related business such as software, those losses equate to a loss of $132,000 per vehicle the unit sells.\n\nFarley said it is crucial for Ford to make profitable EVs in the next five years as Chinese automakers continue to expand globally.\n\n\"If we cannot make money on EVs, we have competitors who have the largest market in the world, who already dominate globally, already setting up their supply chain around the world,\" he said. \"And if we don't make profitable EVs in the next five years, what is the future? We will just shrink into North America.\"",

        "body": "Shoppers are seen at the parking lot of a Tractor Supply Co. store near Bloomsburg.\n\nTractor Supply, a retail chain that sells home improvement equipment, livestock and agricultural supplies for farmers and pet owners, is eliminating diversity, equity and inclusion roles; withdrawing carbon emission goals; and walking back support for the LGBTQ community as part of sweeping changes to environmental, social and governance initiatives, the company announced this week.\n\nThe retailer said in a Thursday release that it will no longer submit data to the Human Rights Campaign, an LGBTQ advocacy group. The company will also stop sponsoring Pride festivals and voting campaigns, the release said. The company previously earned a perfect score on the Human Rights Campaign Foundation's 2022 Best Places to Work Corporate Equality Index.\n\nThe announcement comes in the final days of Pride Month.\n\nTractor Supply is also retiring initiatives aimed at reducing environmental impact and improving employee diversity. The company had set goals to achieve net zero carbon emissions in operations by 2040 and to reduce its water usage by 2025. Its DEI targets included boosting the number of employees of color at the manager level and above by 50% by 2026.\n\nTractor Supply said it's making the changes to better represent the values of the communities and customers it serves. The retailer caters to largely rural communities, with 50,000 employees across 2,250 stores in 49 states, according to company data.\n\n\"Rural communities are the backbone of our nation and what make America great,\" Tractor Supply said in the news release. \"We have heard from customers that we have disappointed them. We have taken this feedback to heart.\"\n\nTractor Supply said it has invested millions of dollars in veteran causes, state fairs, animal shelters, rodeos and farmers markets and that it invests in the future of rural America by being the largest supporter of FFA, a nonprofit that promotes agricultural education for middle and high schoolers.\n\nThe retailer was previously included on Newsweek's list of America's Greatest Workplaces for Diversity in 2023 and was named to Bloomberg's Gender Equality Index for 2022 and 2023.\n\nThe publicly traded company has a market valuation of about $29 billion. CNBC contacted Tractor Supply for more details about the changes, and the company declined to comment beyond the release.\n\nThe changes come amid a growing wave of anti-DEI sentiment in the wake of a U.S. Supreme Court decision in 2023 to strike down affirmative action in colleges. Experts at the time predicted the ruling could have implications for corporate hiring or recruiting.\n\nCompanies, including Starbucks , Disney and Target , have faced legal challenges over DEI initiatives for LGBTQ customers and employees. In February 2023, pharmaceutical giant Pfizer dropped race-based eligibility requirements for a fellowship program designed for college students of Black, Latino and Native American descent, the Associated Press reported.",

        "title": "Nike shares plunge after retailer says quarterly sales will fall 10%, warns on China weakness",
        "body": "Nike shoes and logo are seen at a store in Nice, France on May 28, 2024.\n\nShares of Nike plunged on Friday after the retailer cut its full-year guidance and said it expects sales to drop 10% during its current quarter as it warned of soft sales in China and \"uneven\" consumer trends across the globe.\n\nThe expected 10% first-quarter slump is far below the 3.2% drop that analysts had expected, according to LSEG.\n\nNike shares plunged nearly 20% in trading Friday.\n\nThe sneaker giant, which reported quarterly earnings Thursday, now expects fiscal 2025 sales to be down mid-single digits, compared to analyst estimates of a 0.9% increase. Nike previously expected sales to grow. The company also expects sales in the first half to be down in the high single digits, compared to previous guidance of declines in the low single digits.\n\n\"A comeback at this scale takes time,\" the retailer's finance chief Matthew Friend said on a call with analysts Thursday. \"Although the next few quarters will be challenging, we are confident that we are repositioning Nike to be more competitive with a more balanced portfolio to drive sustainable, profitable, long-term growth.\"\n\nThe company cut its guidance as it contends with slower online sales, planned declines in classic footwear franchises, \"increased macro uncertainty\" in the Greater China region and \"uneven consumer trends\" across Nike's markets, Friend said. It also expects sales into wholesalers to be slower as it scales new innovations and pulls back on classic franchises.\n\nFor the fiscal fourth quarter, the company handily beat earnings estimates as its cost-cutting efforts continue to bear fruit, but Nike fell short on revenue.\n\nHere's how Nike did during the period compared with what Wall Street was anticipating, based on a survey of analysts by LSEG:\n\nEarnings per share: $1.01 adjusted vs. 83 cents expected\n\n$1.01 adjusted vs. 83 cents expected Revenue: $12.61 billion vs. $12.84 billion expected\n\nThe company's reported net income for the three-month period that ended May 31 was $1.5 billion, or 99 cents per share, compared with $1.03 billion, or 66 cents per share, a year earlier.\n\nSales dropped to $12.61 billion, down about 2% from $12.83 billion a year earlier.\n\nIn fiscal 2024, Nike posted sales of $51.36 billion, which is flat compared to the prior year. It's the slowest pace of annual sales growth the company has seen since 2010, excluding the Covid-19 pandemic.\n\nNike executives attributed the sales miss to a range of factors. They said its lifestyle business declined during the quarter and that momentum in its performance business, such as its basketball and running shoes, wasn't enough to offset it.\n\nOnline performance was soft because Nike had a higher share of lifestyle products, more promotions and fewer sales of classic franchises, such as its Air Force 1. It also saw traffic in China decline across all channels beginning in April due to macro conditions in the region.\n\nDespite the traffic decline in China, sales in the region exceeded Wall Street expectations, according to StreetAccount, coming in at $1.86 billion, compared with estimates of $1.79 billion. It was the only geographical segment to top estimates for the period.\n\nSales in North America, its largest market, came in at $5.28 billion, below StreetAccount expectations of $5.45 billion.\n\nIn Europe, Middle East and Africa, Nike posted revenue of $3.29 billion, compared to estimates of $3.32 billion. In Asia Pacific and Latin America, Nike saw $1.71 billion in sales, compared to estimates of $1.77 billion.\n\nStill, Friend later warned of the \"softer outlook\" in China and said had it not been for Chinese marketplace Tmall's early start to the region's 618 shopping holiday, sales in the country would've fallen short of Nike's internal expectations.\n\n\"The China marketplace remains highly promotional, and we continue to manage both Nike and partners' inventory carefully,\" said Friend. \"While our outlook for the near term has softened, we remain confident in Nike's competitive position in China in the long term.\"\n\nNike's Converse brand was once again a significant underperformer in the overall results. The division saw revenue plunge 18% to $480 million, largely due to declines in North America and Western Europe.",

        "body": "Stuck at home during the Covid pandemic, Megan Crozier needed a way to keep her two young children entertained. She bought an inflatable pool from Sam's Club.\n\nThe pool began leaking air after just a few uses.\n\nFor Crozier, chief merchant of the Walmart -owned membership club, that trashed pool \u2014 and the disappointment that came with it \u2014 helped kickstart a years-long effort to catch up with chief rival Costco and the popularity of its private brand, Kirkland Signature.\n\nAs Sam's Club opens more locations, it is trying to raise the bar for its own brand, Member's Mark. The label's makeover has become critical for Sam's Club as it aims to close the gap with Costco, which has roughly the same number of U.S. clubs but about twice as much annual revenue. Net sales for Sam's Club totaled $86.2 billion in its most recent fiscal year, compared with $176.63 billion for Costco's U.S. clubs.\n\nSam's Club CEO Chris Nicholas told CNBC the brand's revamp was inspired, in part, by the retailer's chief rival.\n\n\"The club model survives because you have brilliant merchants focusing on creating or buying exceptional items,\" he said in an interview. \"Costco did such a great job of that over the years with Kirkland and we saw that be successful.\"\n\nThe success of Member's Mark will help determine how Sam's Club fares as its expands, with plans to open more than 30 stores over the next four years. At least some stores will be in regions where potential customers belong to a competing club like Costco or B.J.'s Wholesale , or in areas where customers may need convincing to pay an annual membership to be able to shop.\n\nOvertaking Costco and its beloved private label won't be easy for Sam's Club, said Michael Baker, a retail analyst for D.A. Davidson.\n\n\"Never say never,\" he said. \"Who knows? But I think it's going to take a long time.\"\n\nBut he added Costco's success with Kirkland Signature created a formula that Sam's Club can follow.\n\nThe popularity of Kirkland's brand, which includes a diverse range of items like vodka, batteries and dress shirts, has helped to drive membership sign-ups and renewals. It is one of the features that Costco highlights when the retailer's pitch to members.",

        "body": "The cost of prescription medications in the U.S. has increased 37% since 2014, far surpassing the rate of inflation, according to data from drug savings company GoodRx .\n\nThough the price increases have slowed this year in comparison to the past decade, the higher costs are raising out-of-pocket expenses for consumers. The average American spends $16.26 out of pocket per prescription, according to the data.\n\n\"When things increase \u2026 inevitably, they do trickle down to consumers, especially those who are in a high deductible plan or who don't have insurance or find themselves paying substantially out of pocket,\" said GoodRx director of research Tori Marsh.\n\nGoodRx said the patients' share of the cost continues to grow due to rising copays, coinsurances and deductibles. The company found that over the past 10 years, the average person's deductible nearly doubled, and copays are rising as the majority of plans are adding another tier of drugs with higher copays.\n\nIt is a dynamic GoodRx deems \"the big pinch.\" High medication costs are coupled with reduced insurance coverage. Analyzing coverage for more than 3,700 Medicare Part D plans between 2010 and 2024, GoodRx found that the portion of medications covered dropped 19% during that period.\n\n\"The impact is really kind of threefold,\" Marsh said. \"Rising costs or rising prices are a big part of it, but it's really that with the combination of increased friction. \u2026 It's hard for people to, in some ways, access their medication or access a pharmacy. And then on top of that, insurance is not what it used to be. It's not covering as much as it used to.\"\n\nOn average, Americans pay two to three times more for prescription drugs than consumers in other developed countries, according to the White House.\n\nDrug costs have become a focus for President Joe Biden, particularly as he approaches the 2024 election. The Biden administration has taken several measures to lower out-of-pocket drug expenses.\n\nOn Wednesday, the White House announced it would lower prices on 64 prescription drugs for some Medicare beneficiaries as a result of inflation penalties on drugmakers.\n\nThe lower costs, effective during the third quarter, will benefit roughly 750,000 people who use the drugs annually, some of whom could save up to $4,593 per day, according to the release.\n\n\"Despite efforts by policymakers and industry leaders to break down affordability and accessibility barriers, a patient's actual out-of-pocket cost continues to increase and is often a huge surprise to them,\" said GoodRx interim CEO Scott Wagner in a news release.\n\n\u2014 CNBC's Annika Kim Constantino contributed to this report.",

        "body": "A dog looks out the window from a Tesla electric vehicle charging at a Tesla Supercharger location in Santa Monica, California on May 15, 2024.\n\nTesla is losing its lead over legacy automakers in the quality of its new all-electric vehicles, according to an annual influential study conducted by J.D. Power.\n\nThe 2024 U.S. Initial Quality Study found the quality of Tesla's battery-electric vehicles, or BEVs, and those of traditional carmakers were the same, at 266 problems reported per 100 newly sold or leased vehicles.\n\nPreviously, Tesla models had outperformed the electric vehicles of legacy automakers in the annual survey. Last year, the Tesla received a rank of 257 problems per 100 vehicles, compared with 265 problems per 100 vehicles on average for EVs from traditional automakers.\n\nThe study attributes Tesla's growing problems to a negative response from customers after the company removed traditional feature controls, such as turn signals and wiper stalks.\n\nAcross the broader industry, not just BEVs, Tesla has consistently ranked toward the bottom in initial quality since J.D. Power began including Tesla in the study in 2022.\n\nOverall, the study, which included repair visits data of franchised dealers for the first time, found electric vehicles such as BEVs and plug-in hybrid electric vehicles (PHEVs), are plagued with more problems than traditional gas- and diesel-powered vehicles with internal combustion engines.\n\n\"Owners of cutting edge, tech-filled BEVs and PHEVs are experiencing problems that are of a severity level high enough for them to take their new vehicle into the dealership at a rate three times higher than that of gas-powered vehicle owners,\" J.D. Power's senior director of auto benchmarking, Frank Hanley, said in a news release.\n\nThe study found that plug-in vehicles require more repairs than gas-powered vehicles across all repair categories.\n\nBEVs averaged 266 problems per 100 vehicles, 86 points higher than gas- and diesel-powered vehicles, which averaged 180 problems per 100 vehicles, according to the study. A lower score indicates higher vehicle quality.\n\nTop concerns included features, controls and displays as well as wireless smartphone integration, as customers reported frequent difficulties with Apple CarPlay and Android Auto.\n\nThe study also reported frustration over false warnings, unnecessary traffic alerts and automatic braking features. Specifically, rear seat reminders contribute 1.7 problems per 100 vehicles across the industry, as owners report receiving signals even when no one is in the rear seat.\n\n\"It is not surprising that the introduction of new technology has challenged manufacturers to maintain vehicle quality,\" Hanley said.\n\n\u2014 CNBC's Michael Wayland contributed to this report.",

        "body": "In this article RIVN Follow your favorite stocks CREATE FREE ACCOUNT\n\n2025 Rivian R1S Rivian\n\nA Thursday investor event for Rivian Automotive that focused on cost-cutting efforts, efficiency gains and in-house technologies and software wasn't enough to build on the company's significant share growth this week. Shares of the all-electric vehicle startup fell by about 2% to 6% for much of the event, eating into some of its 23% gain in shares the day before on news of an up to $5 billion investment by Volkswagen Group . Rivian's stock closed Thursday down 1.8% to $14.47 per share, off by roughly 39% year to date amid investor concerns regarding cash burn and a slowdown in EV sales. Rivian on Thursday reconfirmed its 2024 guidance that included production of 57,000 vehicles and a path to positive gross profit during the fourth quarter, including regulatory credits. It also outlined longer-term growths, such as plans to achieve positive adjusted earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization in 2027. \"Everything that you're hearing from us, around our product, around how we're running the business, around how we're driving toward profitability, my hope is that you're seeing really an extreme sense of urgency,\" Rivian CEO RJ Scaringe said during the event. \"We're very, very fast driving towards the improvements necessary to get to positive free cash flow and, before that, positive margins this year.\"\n\nStock Chart Icon Stock chart icon Rivian's stock performance\n\nRivian also outlined long-term financial targets of a roughly 25% gross margin, 10% free cash flow and adjusted profit margin in the \"high teens.\" The company did not release a time frame for these targets. Scaringe spent much of his time during the roughly four-hour presentation discussing efficiencies in products and manufacturing, which he said are expected to lead to 20% material cost reductions in its current vehicles, followed by 45% targeted reductions in its upcoming \"R2\" vehicles, which are projected to begin production in early 2026. The reductions range from physical savings, such as a 54% decrease in design costs of its R2 vehicles compared with current models, to lower costs on more complex systems such as battery packs and electrical hardware. For example, the company is using 10 fewer in-house electronic control units, or ECUs, in its recently redesigned R1 vehicles, allowing it to remove 1.6 miles in wiring harness length and 44 pounds out of the vehicle. Rivian's software expertise is at the center of VW's plans to invest $5 billion in the automaker by 2026, including an anticipated joint venture between the companies to create electrical architecture and software technology. Volkswagen is expected to use Rivian's electrical architecture and software stack for vehicles beginning in the second half of the decade, Scaringe said during the investment announcement. He said the joint venture does not include anything with battery technologies, vehicle propulsion platforms, high voltage systems or autonomy and electrical hardware.\n\nA provided image of Oliver Blume, CEO of Volkswagen Group and RJ Scaringe, founder and CEO of Rivian, as the companies announce joint venture plans on June 25, 2024.

That compares with the company's previous outlook of between $3.20 and $3.35 per share.\n\n\"'We assumed ... in the second half that the consumer would get somewhat stronger\" but \"that is not the case,\" Walgreens CEO Tim Wentworth told CNBC.\n\nHe added that \"the consumer is absolutely stunned by the absolute prices of things, and the fact that some of them may not be inflating doesn't actually change their resistance to the current pricing. So we've had to get really keen, particularly in discretionary things.\"\n\nStill, Walgreens topped revenue estimates for the quarter on strong performance in its health-care segment. The company views that business division as critical to its ongoing push to transform from a major drugstore chain into a large health-care company.\n\nThe results come as Walgreens works to slash costs after a rocky last year marked by low pharmacy reimbursement rates, weakening demand for Covid products and a challenging macroeconomic environment.\n\nThe company on Friday said it is simplifying its U.S. health-care portfolio and finalizing plans to close underperforming U.S. stores over multiple years, among other ongoing cost-cutting efforts.\n\n\"Seventy-five percent of our stores drive 100% of our profitability today,\" Wentworth said. \"What that means is the others we take a hard look at, we are going to finalize a number that we will close.\"\n\nHere's what Walgreens reported for the three-month period ended May 31 compared with what Wall Street was expecting, based on a survey of analysts by LSEG:\n\nEarnings per share: 63 cents adjusted vs. 68 cents expected\n\n63 cents adjusted vs. 68 cents expected Revenue: $36.4 billion vs. $35.94 billion expected\n\nWalgreens booked sales of $36.4 billion for the quarter, up 2.6% from the same period a year ago.\n\nThe company reported net income of $344 million, or 40 cents per share, for the quarter. That compares with net income of $118 million, or 14 cents per share, for the same period a year ago.\n\nExcluding certain items, adjusted earnings were 63 cents per share for the quarter.\n\nWalgreens did not provide a new revenue forecast for the fiscal year. The company has not offered that guidance since October, when it said it expected $141 billion to $145 billion in sales.",

        "title": "Levi's shares drop 15% as jeans maker's sales disappoint despite denim craze",
        "body": "Denim is having a moment with consumers, but it hasn't led to a major sales boost at Levi Strauss .\n\nThe jeans creator on Wednesday posted fiscal second-quarter revenue that fell just short of Wall Street's expectations at a time when shoppers are stocking their wardrobes with denim dresses, skirts and ultra low-rise baggy pants.\n\nLevi's posted better-than-expected earnings as its direct sales to consumers and cost cutting continue to bear fruit. The company raised its dividend by 8% to 13 cents per share, its first increase in six quarters.\n\nStill, shares fell about 15% in extended trading.\n\nHere's how Levi's performed during the quarter compared with what Wall Street was anticipating, based on a survey of analysts by LSEG:\n\nEarnings per share: 16 cents adjusted vs. 11 cents expected\n\n16 cents adjusted vs. 11 cents expected Revenue: $1.44 billion vs. $1.45 billion expected\n\nThe company's reported net income for the three-month period that ended May 26 was $18 million, or 4 cents per share, compared with a loss of $1.6 million, or zero cents a share, a year earlier. Excluding one-time items, Levi's posted earnings of $66 million, or 16 cents per share.\n\nSales rose to $1.44 billion, up about 8% from $1.34 billion a year earlier. However, the sales jump was coming off of an easier comparison.\n\nIn the year-ago period, sales were down 9% after Levi's shifted its wholesale shipments from its fiscal second quarter into its fiscal first quarter. The shift reduced sales last year by about $100 million, the company said previously. Excluding the shift, as well as the exit of Levi's Denizen business, sales would have been up by only about 1% in its most recent quarter compared to the year-ago period.\n\nFinance chief Harmit Singh attributed the sales miss to unfavorable foreign exchange conditions and weak sales at Docker's. During the quarter, the khaki and chinos brand saw $82.4 million in sales, up 8.6% from $75.8 million in the year ago period. It's not clear how sales at Docker's were affected by the timing of Levi's wholesale orders.\n\n\"People are generally cautious,\" Singh told CNBC in an interview. \"It's not necessarily an environment where people are buying a lot, people are cautious.\"\n\nWhile Levi's posted a strong earnings beat, it only reaffirmed its full-year guidance, which was in line with estimates. The company continues to expect full-year earnings per share to be between $1.17 and $1.27, which now includes a 5-cent hit coming from the company's new distribution and logistics strategy.\n\nLevi's said it is transitioning from a primarily owned-and-operated distribution and logistics network in the U.S. and Europe to one that relies more on third parties.\n\n\"In the near term, these changes require the parallel operation of new and old facilities for the rest of 2024, resulting in a transitory increase in distribution costs,\" the company said.\n\nThe change allows Levi's to shift the responsibility of final mile delivery to third parties. The denim maker noted that it has new terms with its supplier that result in Levi's taking ownership of inventory closer to the point of shipment rather than its eventual destination. Levi's distribution network was built for a business that primarily sold to wholesalers, and now it needs to change into one that's more focused on selling directly to consumers.\n\nThe changes are necessary because nearly half of Levi's sales these days are coming from its own website and stores.\n\nDirect-to-consumer sales jumped 8% during the quarter, representing 47% of overall sales. Online sales increased 19%.\n\n\"Our transformational pivot to operating as a DTC-first company is yielding positive results around the world, giving me great confidence that we will achieve accelerated, profitable growth for the rest of the year and beyond,\" CEO Michelle Gass said in a statement.\n\nDuring the quarter, wholesale revenue grew 7%, but excluding the shift in timing of wholesale orders, sales in the channel decreased 4%. Singh noted that wholesale revenue improved on a sequential basis, but the company has a \"conservative\" view of the channel's growth moving forward.\n\nBy building out its own direct channels, Levi's enjoys higher profits, better data on its consumers and less reliance on shaky wholesalers like Macy's and Kohl's, which are continuing to shrink and fall out of favor with consumers.\n\nHowever, selling directly can also be more expensive, and can come with unexpected hiccups that can impact sales and drain profits. For example, when someone buys a pair of Levi's from Macy's and wants to return them, Macy's typically bears that cost. Under a direct model, that responsibility, including the cost and logistics, would fall on Levi's.\n\nNike has come to be known as a cautionary tale for retailers long reliant on wholesalers that try to expand direct sales.\n\nFor a while, Nike's focus on direct sales boosted revenue and profits, but some critics said the strategy shift led to a slowdown in innovation, and ultimately, market share losses.\n\nRecently, the company acknowledged that it erred when it cut off so many of its wholesale partners and said it has since \"corrected\" that.\n\nRead the full earnings release here.",

Jeff Greenberg | Universal Images Group | Getty Images\n\nIn a lyric on her latest album, Beyonc\u00e9 sings \"denim on denim, on denim, on denim.\" Levi Strauss shoppers are taking that advice to heart. Levi Strauss executives are ecstatic. Western wear is booming as consumers opt for top-to-bottom denim looks, the iconic, 171-year-old clothing maker said on Wednesday. As the style wins cultural favor, its popularity is juicing denim niches \u2014 like shirts, skirts and dresses \u2014 that fall outside Levi's widely-known blue jean offerings. \"The growing popularity of Western wear is at an all-time high,\" CEO Michelle Gass told analysts Wednesday night after the California-based retailer's latest earnings report for the quarter ended in May. A Western renaissance has been gaining traction over the past several months, sending stylish shoppers searching for pieces like jeans, boots and cowboy hats. Levi's scored a huge hit when its jean brand was referenced in Beyonc\u00e9's song \"Levii's Jeans,\" released earlier this year. Beyond Beyonc\u00e9's chart-topping \"Cowboy Carter\" album, the increased ubiquity of Western style has also been tied to a fashion line unveiled by Louis Vuitton earlier this year and Taylor Swift's ongoing Eras Tour.\n\nGass, who took over as Levi Strauss CEO earlier this year after previously serving as the CEO at Kohl's , has touted that denim is having a moment in the popular imagination, with Western wear trending more broadly throughout the culture. More specific data shared on the company's earnings call Wednesday showed how Levi Strauss is taking advantage of demand for denim beyond its popular \"501\" jeans. Sales of denim skirts, jumpsuits and dresses all at least doubled in the latest quarter, Gass said. Western shirts sales are also up significantly, she said, especially on the women's side. Levi is find success in what the 55-year-old chief executive described as a new strategy of trying to dress customers denim \u2014 from head-to-toe. \"Our new focus is, yes, continuing to own jeans, but taking that denim top to bottom,\" Gass said on CNBC's \"Mad Money\" late Wednesday. While noting that the denim skirt and dress categories haven't been historically large for the company, now \"they're exploding,\" she said.\n\nwatch now\n\nDenim rage sets a high bar on Wall Street\n\nTo be sure, the well-documented denim craze alone isn't necessarily impressing Wall Street. Levi Strauss tumbled more than 15% on Thursday in response to its latest numbers, its second worst day since going public in early 2019. Levi Strauss posted $1.44 billion in revenue in the fiscal second quarter, slightly missing the $1.45 billion consensus forecast of analysts polled by LSEG despite the denim boom. The company's finance chief told CNBC that the sales miss was driven by unfavorable foreign exchange rates and weakness in the Dockers brand. On the other hand, Levi Strauss earned 16 cents per share, excluding items, ahead of the 11-cent average estimate by analysts. In the year through Wednesday, shares had run up amid the buzz around the cotton-based fabric and the resurgence of Western clothing. Following Thursday's drop, the stock is still up more than 18% on the year. For comparison, shares of Kontoor Brands , the parent of denim brands Wrangler and Lee, have risen 5% year to date.\n\nStock Chart Icon Stock chart icon Levi Strauss, year to date",

        "body": "Including food and energy, headline inflation was flat on the month and also up 2.6% on an annual basis. Those readings also were in line with expectations.\n\nBoth numbers were in line with the Dow Jones estimates. May marked the lowest annual rate since March 2021, which was the first time in this economic cycle that inflation topped the Fed's 2% target.\n\nThe core personal consumption expenditures price index increased just a seasonally adjusted 0.1% for the month and was up 2.6% from a year ago, the latter number down 0.2 percentage point from the April level, according to a Commerce Department report .\n\nAn important economic measure for the Federal Reserve showed Friday that inflation during May slowed to its lowest annual rate in more than three years.\n\n\"It is just additional news that monetary policy is working, inflation is gradually cooling,\" San Francisco Fed President Mary Daly told CNBC's Andrew Ross Sorkin during a \"Squawk Box\" interview. \"That's a relief for businesses and households who've been struggling with persistently high inflation. It's good news for how policy is working.\"\n\nThe Fed focuses on the PCE inflation reading as opposed to the more widely followed consumer price index from the Labor Department's Bureau of Labor Statistics. PCE is a broader inflation measure and accounts for changes in consumer behavior, such as substituting their purchases when prices rise.\n\nWhile the central bank officially follows headline PCE, officials generally stress the core reading as a better gauge of longer-term inflation trends.\n\nOutside of the inflation numbers, the Bureau of Economic Analysis report showed that personal income rose 0.5% on the month, stronger than the 0.4% estimate. Consumer spending, however, increased 0.2%, weaker than the 0.3% forecast.\n\nPrices were held in check during the month by a 0.4% decline for goods and a 2.1% slide in energy, which offset a 0.2% increase in services and a 0.1% gain for food.\n\nHowever, housing prices continued to rise, up 0.4% on the month for the fourth straight time. Shelter-related costs have proven stickier than Federal Reserve officials have anticipated and have helped keep the central bank from reducing interest rates as expected this year.\n\nStock market futures were modestly positive following the report while Treasury yields were negative on the session.\n\nInvestors have been trying to handicap the Fed's intentions on rates this year and have had to scale back expectations. Whereas traders earlier in 2024 had been expecting at least six rate cuts this year they are now pricing in just two, starting in September. Fed officials at their June meeting penciled in just one reduction this year.\n\n\"The lack of surprise in today's PCE number is a relief and will be welcomed by the Fed,\" said Seema Shah, chief global strategist at Principal Asset Management. \"However, the policy path is not yet certain. A further deceleration in inflation, ideally coupled with additional evidence of labor market softening, will be necessary to pave the way for a first rate cut in September.\"\n\nThe Fed targets 2% inflation and began raising interest rates in March 2022 after a year of dismissing rising prices as transitory effects from the Covid pandemic that likely would fade. The central bank last raised rates in July 2023 after taking its benchmark overnight borrowing level to a range of 5.25%-5.50%, the highest in some 23 years.\n\nRecent economic data has painted a picture of an economy that has withstood the Fed's aggressive monetary tightening. Gross domestic product rose at a 1.4% annualized rate in the first quarter and is on pace to increase 2.2% in the second quarter, according to the Atlanta Fed.\n\nThere have been some slight cracks in the labor market lately, with continuing jobless claims hitting their highest level since November 2021. However, the unemployment rate is still 4%, low by historical means though also rising at a slow pace.",

        "body": "People purchase beverages in a store on a sweltering afternoon in Brooklyn, New York, on the first day of summer on June 21, 2024.\n\nThe official Dow Jones forecasts for Friday's numbers are for the headline, or all-item, PCE price reading to come in flat on the month, while core is projected to rise 0.1%. That would compare to respective increases of 0.3% and 0.2% in April . Both headline and core are forecast at 2.6% on a year-over-year basis.\n\nIf that date rings a bell, it's when core PCE first passed the Fed's coveted 2% inflation target during this cycle. Despite a series of aggressive interest rate increases since then, the central bank has yet to wrest the pace of price increases back into its target range.\n\nBut even more importantly, when stripping out volatile food and energy prices, the core PCE price index, which draws even closer scrutiny from Fed policymakers, is set to indicate its lowest annual reading since March 2021.\n\nThe personal consumption expenditures price index, an inflation measure the Federal Reserve watches closely, is expected to show little, if any, monthly increase for May, the first time that would be the case since November 2023.\n\nThere could be some pretty good inflation news on the way from the Commerce Department when it releases a key economic report Friday.\n\nShould the core PCE price forecasts transpire, it will serve as a milestone of sorts.\n\n\"We are in line with [the forecast] that the PCE core pricing data will come in soft,\" said Beth Ann Bovino, chief economist at U.S. Bank. \"That's good news for the Fed. It's also good for people's pocketbooks, although I don't know if people feel it just yet.\"\n\nIndeed, while the rate of inflation has receded precipitously from its mid-2022 peak, prices have not. Since that March 2021 benchmark, core PCE is up 14%.\n\nThat steep climb and its pernicious effect is why Fed officials are not ready to declare victory yet, despite the obvious progress made since the rate hikes began in March 2022.\n\n\"Returning inflation sustainably to our 2% target is an ongoing process and not a fait accompli,\" Fed Governor Lisa Cook said earlier this week.\n\nCook and her colleagues have been circumspect about the timing and pace of rate cuts, though most agree that easing is likely at some point this year as long as the data stays in line. Futures markets are currently pricing in a good likelihood that the Fed will enact its first quarter-percentage-point cut in September, with another to follow by the end of the year. Policymakers at their meeting earlier this month penciled in just one cut.\n\n\"We do expect softening in the real economy \u2014 not falling off a cliff, just softening \u2014 that suggests that inflation will be softer as well later on. That gives us reason to expect the Fed will be able to likely have their first cut in September,\" Bovino said.\n\n\"Now we all know it depends on the data and the Fed is still watching,\" she added. \"Could they wait? Could it just be a one and done this year? I can't rule it out. But it does look like the numbers might give the Fed cover to cut rates two times this year.\"\n\nIn addition to the inflation numbers, the Commerce Department at 8:30 a.m. ET will release figures on personal income and consumer spending, with estimates at a rise of 0.4% and 0.3%, respectively.",

        "body": "A sign is posted in front of an Olive Garden restaurant on June 20, 2024 in Rohnert Park, California.\n\nDividend-paying stocks can help investors bolster their portfolios and boost returns.\n\nInvestors searching for these names will need to find companies that have a track record of making steady payments, backed by robust financials.\n\nHere are three attractive dividend stocks, according to Wall Street's top pros on TipRanks, a platform that ranks analysts based on their past performance.\n\nDarden Restaurants\n\nThe first dividend stock is Darden Restaurants (DRI), which operates several popular brands in full-service dining, including Olive Garden, LongHorn Steakhouse and Yard House. The company recently announced mixed results for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2024. While Darden exceeded analysts' earnings expectations, its sales slightly missed the Street's consensus amid increased discounting by rivals.\n\nDarden issued $628 million in dividends and committed $454 million to share repurchases in fiscal 2024. Moreover, the company announced a dividend hike of nearly 7%, bringing the quarterly dividend to $1.40 per share. The stock has a dividend yield of 3.5%.\n\nFollowing the results, BTIG analyst Peter Saleh reiterated a buy rating on DRI stock with a price target of $175. The analyst highlighted that at the mid-point, Darden's earnings per share outlook of $9.40 to $9.60 indicates double-digit total shareholder return, which is in line with the company's long-term targets.\n\nSaleh thinks that the company can achieve its targeted return metrics, supported by several factors, including a modest rise in pricing, advertising initiatives and easing inflation.\n\n\"We view Darden Restaurants as one of the strongest operators in the industry with historical sales and restaurant margin performance that has consistently exceeded peers,\" said Saleh.\n\nSaleh ranks No. 360 among more than 8,900 analysts tracked by TipRanks. His ratings have been successful 61% of the time, with each delivering an average return of 11.7%. (See Darden's Financial Statements on TipRanks)\n\nInternational Seaways\n\nNext up is International Seaways (INSW), a tanker company that offers energy transportation services for crude oil and petroleum products. On June 26, the company paid a combined dividend of $1.75 per share. The company's combined dividend represented 60% of its first-quarter adjusted net income.\n\nIn its first-quarter results, INSW highlighted that its combined dividend payments of $5.74 per share over the last twelve months reflected a dividend yield of more than 13%.\n\nFollowing meetings with INSW's management, Stifel analyst Benjamin Nolan reaffirmed a buy rating on the stock and increased the price target to $68 from $66. The analyst noted that the tanker market remains cyclically strong due to a continued increase in global oil consumption, the limited supply of new ships and the longer average voyage lengths caused by the ongoing geopolitical troubles.\n\nAccordingly, Nolan increased his rate assumptions for 2024 and 2025. The analyst expects International Seaways to continue to deliver higher cash flows, fueled by a favorable backdrop for the tanker market.\n\nNolan expects INSW to sustain high supplemental dividends, given the estimated $200 million to $300 million of excess cash flow after capital expenditure (assuming there is no new debt associated with tanker acquisitions). \"We are modeling $5.51/share in 2024 dividends, although there is room to be a little higher,\" said the analyst.\n\nNolan ranks No. 68 among more than 8,900 analysts tracked by TipRanks. His ratings have been successful 67% of the time, with each delivering an average return of 19.5%. (See International Seaways' Stock Charts on TipRanks)\n\nCitigroup\n\nFinally, let's discuss this week's third dividend stock, banking giant Citigroup (C). At a quarterly dividend of 53 cents per share, Citigroup offers a yield of 3.3%.\n\nThe bank held its Services Investor Day on June 18. Management expressed confidence about achieving the 2024 guidance, driven by revenue growth across all the core businesses despite macro uncertainty and the possibility of lower interest rates.\n\nFollowing the event, Goldman Sachs analyst Richard Ramsden reiterated a buy rating on Citigroup stock and slightly raised his price target to $72 from $71. The higher price target reflects an increase in the analyst's EPS estimates for 2024, 2025 and 2026 based on management's commentary, which indicated that the bank's strategic transformation plan is gaining momentum.\n\nRamsden noted that Citi is highly focused on its transformation efforts, with the bank making steady progress on risk control and data quality. Coming to the Services business, the analyst noted that management established strategic priorities for this vital component of the company's financial targets. The analyst estimates that the Services business will account for 25% of the group revenue growth through 2026.\n\n\"The Services business is well positioned to maintain their market leading positions with potential to continue share gains across businesses,\" said Ramsden. The analyst's optimism is based on Citi's extensive global network in 95 countries, well-established long-term client relationships, and market share gains that are expected to be driven by investments in technology and innovative offerings.\n\nRamsden ranks No. 969 among more than 8,900 analysts tracked by TipRanks. His ratings have been successful 65% of the time, with each delivering an average return of 11.9%. (See Citigroup Technical Analysis on TipRanks)",

        "title": "Activist Jana has a stake in Rapid7. There are two paths to bolster value at the cybersecurity company",
        "body": "Business: Rapid7 is a global cybersecurity software and services provider. Its products span across information security, cloud operations, development and information technology teams, enabling them to understand attackers and leverage that information to take control of their fragmented attack surface. Rapid7 Managed Threat Complete is the company's flagship offering, and it includes the Rapid7 Managed Detection and Response program. Rapid7 also provides risk and threat coverage through InsightIDR and Insight VM services, making them available in a single package. Its security solutions help more than 11,000 global customers unite cloud risk management and threat detection.\n\nActivist Commentary: Jana is a very experienced activist investor founded in 2001 by Barry Rosenstein. The firm made its name taking deeply researched activist positions with well-conceived plans for long term value. Rosenstein called his activist strategy \"V cubed.\" The three \"Vs\" were\" (i) Value: buying at the right price; (ii) Votes: knowing whether you have the votes before commencing a proxy fight; and (iii) Variety of ways to win: having more than one strategy to enhance value and exit an investment. Since 2008, the firm has gradually shifted that strategy to one which we characterize as the three \"Ss\" (i) Stock price: buying at the right price; (ii) Strategic activism: sale of company or spinoff of a business; and (iii) Star advisors/nominees: aligning with top industry executives to advise them and take board seats if necessary.\n\nRapid7 is a cybersecurity company that expands the expertise of its clients' security operations. Its Managed Threat Complete flagship offering combines end-to-end 24/7 managed detection and response with vulnerability management offerings. Historically, the company has focused on on-site cybersecurity operations, but it has begun to expand into the explosive growth area of cloud security. Rapid7 operates in a highly attractive industry and is the beneficiary of some meaningful tailwinds. In a time where software budgets are being cut or reallocated toward AI, the threat of cyberattacks looms large and presents a great enough risk that spend is either flat or increasing for these types of services. In addition, cybersecurity analysts and internal security staff are limited, so there is a tremendous need for outsourcing. With more complex operations and numerous applications both on-site and in the cloud, Rapid7 is well-positioned to continue growing and aims to be a high-quality provider for subject matter experts who may not be able to retain the services of their largest and most expensive competitors.\n\nDespite its favorable position, the company has delivered negative returns on a one-, three-, and five-year basis. Rapid7 is one of three main players in vulnerability management, yet it's assigned a much smaller revenue multiple (3x) compared to peers Tenable (5.5x) and Qualys (8x). One factor in this is that Rapid7 offers a combination of low- and high-growth cybersecurity offerings, which is difficult to value, but more important are the multiple slip-ups by management, exacerbated by a lack of oversight by the board. First, the company has undergone changes to its sales model, including a shift to selling packaged products from selling offerings individually. It's also moved to a channel model from direct. Next, the company has encountered challenges in bringing its cloud product to market. In addition, to shift from pure growth to a profitable software company, Rapid7 has focused on meeting targets for $160 million in free cash flow and improved margins. In August 2023, likely in pursuit of these goals, the company abruptly announced plans to reduce its staff by 18%. Rapid7 has had further retention problems in key executive roles, including the departure of its chief innovation officer and its critically important chief operating officer and president. Finally, the company has not been able to properly make forecasts, leading to tremendous investor uncertainty and questions of board oversight. In February 2024, the company announced its 2024 guidance, which it stated it was highly confident in, only to cut it in May when the company delivered its Q1 results. That led to a 17% stock price decline on May 8. This is a company operating in a highly complex and dynamic space \u2013 it is doing everything all at once and has seemingly failed to deliver.\n\nWith a company like this, there are generally two paths to shareholder value creation: (i) a long-term plan involving board reconstitution, management overhaul and review of strategic and operational plans and (ii) a shorter-term plan to sell the company to an interested buyer who can make those changes. With respect to the long-term plan, Jana generally works with industry executives and consultants in performing due diligence and implementing its activist plans, and we do not expect this situation to be different. The firm will often bring these individuals to the table to serve as director nominees, if deemed necessary. Jana is experienced in getting these experts on company boards, where they often serve as assets in getting the company to correct its issues, from operational to governance to capital allocation. But Jana also has extensive experience in strategic activism and getting portfolio companies sold. We expect that Jana will advocate for the strategy it expects will maximize shareholder value on a risk- and time-adjusted basis. Given the problems the company has been experiencing and the lack of CEO focus (Aside from being chairman and CEO of Rapid7, Corey Thomas is on the National Security Telecommunications Advisory Committee, chair of the Federal Reserve Bank of Boston and a member of the Council on Foreign Relations. He also serves on the boards of the Blue Cross Blue Shield of Massachusetts, LPL Financial and Vanderbilt University.), a sale looks like it could be the easier and more certain path if there is a suitor at the right price.\n\nGiven industry tailwinds, there may be several strategic and financial buyers interested in this company. Recent transactions in the cybersecurity sector include Cisco's $28 billion takeover of Splunk and Francisco Partners' $1.7 billion acquisition of Sumo Logic. If Jana does advocate for a sale of Rapid7, it will ask the board to do it through a full sales process that attains the highest value for shareholders. In addition, Jana has a strategic partnership with Cannae Holdings, which could be helpful in providing the equity in a strategic transaction with a private equity firm. Consider that in 2019, Cannae joined with private-equity firms to buy Dun & Bradstreet. It is important to note that even if Jana thinks a sale of the company is the best way to optimize shareholder value, the firm will still have to get the board to agree. This does not look like a board and management team that will just go quietly. In such a case, Jana's remedy would be to launch a proxy fight, but that could take some time. The 2024 annual meeting just passed on June 13 and the director nomination window does not open until Feb.13, 2025.\n\nKen Squire is the founder and president of 13D Monitor, an institutional research service on shareholder activism, and the founder and portfolio manager of the 13D Activist Fund, a mutual fund that invests in a portfolio of activist 13D investments.",

        "body": "ANALYSIS\n\nGen Z is maturing within an unprecedented culture of media saturation. The entire world, via the internet, is available to them at all times on their smartphones.\n\nAnd it\u2019s not always a happy place, nor is it one that\u2019s particularly easy to make sense of. As such, their relationship with media, with themselves \u2014 and with other people \u2014 is complicated in a number of ways we are still realizing.\n\nBut what if I told you they, just like us, crave and seek out the advice and consolation of trusted people in their real lives when they\u2019re struggling? What if I told you that most prefer to connect face-to-face rather than through technology?\n\nYou might be surprised. After all, the mainstream depiction of Gen Z is often a teen endlessly scrolling on their phone, beset by depression and anxiety, falling slowly away from family and faith.\n\nBut that\u2019s not what they\u2019re like at all. According to recent data in The RELATE Project, the majority of Gen Z wants to talk to trusted parents, mentors, and friends when they\u2019re struggling. Gen Z is seeking connection and intentional relationships. They are surprisingly grounded, community-oriented, prayerful, and intentional as a demographic.\n\nThankfully, breaking down the walls between Gen Z and older generations seems to be something anyone and everyone can do, if they choose. The adolescents interviewed for The RELATE Project were quick to express a desire for authentic, no-fuss dinner-table conversations, recognizing that such an environment lends itself towards engaging in meaningful discussions about life and what\u2019s on their minds. Sharing life and authentic conversations\u2014where both sides listen\u2014also promotes relationship.\n\nThat means that any one of us can make a difference in the lives of Gen Z. Any one of us can open our homes to them, welcome them into our families, and invite them to share their lives, struggles, and joys at our side.\n\nSo invite them for dinner. Ask them to stay awhile. If we want them to flourish, we must unabashedly fling open the doors of our homes to the younger people in our midst, allowing them access to our dinner table, yes, but most importantly to our experiences, our lived wisdom, our relationship with God, our kindness, our time, and even our challenges.\n\nWhy? Because face-to-face interactions in an intimate, authentic setting can be the catalyst for a meaningful, long-term relationship of trust and respect. These relationships provide emerging adults with the tools \u2013 and the relationships \u2013 they need to thrive now and later on.\n\nOf course, feeding them isn\u2019t the only thing you need to do when they sit down at your table. The most important thing is to listen to them without judgment. They may not always want or even need our advice, but they do need us to actively listen \u2013 so be engaged and attentive. A simple \u201cTell me more,\u201d \u201cGo on,\u201d or \u201cWhat else?\u201d shows that you are listening and creating space for those at your table to share with ease. Just as Kelly Corrigan advocates in her show Tell Me More, asking thoughtful questions leads to better connections and conversations.\n\nMy family made a practice of intentionally sharing our daily highs and lows at dinner. We found that, in doing so, we laid the groundwork for more complicated, personal, probing conversations \u2014 conversations that involved community concerns, faith, friendships, sorrows, and the future. These conversations were a tremendous gift to all of us, and I cherish the intimacy and authenticity we shared over those meals.\n\nThe kitchen table became a place to share the funny stories of our days, the struggles, and how we saw God showing up in our lives. I think our adult kids still feel safe to come to us now thanks in part to relationships built around the dinner table when they were young.\n\nBut this sense of safety, belonging, and trust shouldn\u2019t be limited to our own children or immediate family. It can be extended to every person whose lives we touch, though it may look very different from home to home or from person to person.\n\nYou can, for instance, become the available parent or grandparent, the house where all the kids hang out after school, and create a space of hospitality \u2013 where all are welcome. Because it\u2019s in those moments of carpooling, dishing out snacks, and opening your home after baseball or dance practice that opportunities arise to express that they are welcome, valued, and cared about \u2014 and that they belong.\n\nCarving out time to build authentic relationships with Gen Z matters. They\u2019ve told us they need us. They\u2019ve told us how they need us. So let\u2019s listen.\n\nDr. Kimberly Nollan is the director of research and evaluation at Young Life.",
        "summary": "According to recent data in The RELATE Project, the majority of Gen Z wants to talk to trusted parents, mentors, and friends when they\u2019re struggling.\nThankfully, breaking down the walls between Gen Z and older generations seems to be something anyone and everyone can do, if they choose.\nThat means that any one of us can make a difference in the lives of Gen Z.\nWe found that, in doing so, we laid the groundwork for more complicated, personal, probing conversations \u2014 conversations that involved community concerns, faith, friendships, sorrows, and the future.\nCarving out time to build authentic relationships with Gen Z matters.",

        "title": "The Faith of Our Fathers: God and the American Revolution",
        "body": "CBN.com - Many people are unaware of America's Judeo-Christian heritage. The following are short profiles of some of America's founding fathers, sharing their thoughts on how God's hand could be seen in the establishment of this nation.\n\nJohn Adams\n\nIn June of 1776, John Adams was in Philadelphia, deep in the flurry of political activity. The Continental Congress appointed him, along with Thomas Jefferson and three others, to draft a \"Declaration of Independence\" from England. Although Adams was later to become the second president of the United States, he is best remembered for being one of the great minds and statesmen of the American Revolution. His prolific diaries, letters, and books provide an invaluable insight into the politics of the time and to what liberty meant to the founding fathers.\n\nFreedom, Adams believed, did not rest solely on man. Instead, he wrote, \"It is religion and morality alone, which can establish the principles upon which freedom can securely stand ... the only foundation for a free constitution is pure virtues, and if this cannot be inspired into our people, in a greater measure, than they have it now, they may change their rulers, and the forms of government, but they will not obtain a lasting liberty\" (letter to cousin Zabdiel Adams, June 21, 1776).\n\nJohn Adams would face another difficult situation as the second president of the United States in 1798. He had a hard act to follow -- the popular George Washington. Although he tried to avoid the trap of partisan politics, Adams soon found himself caught in its web. And if trouble at home wasn't bad enough, diplomatic relations with France were rapidly sinking. Adams prepared the American army and navy for defensive measures against France.\n\nIt was during this time that Adams spoke to the first brigade of the militia of Massachusetts, and re-affirmed the foundations for the American government:\n\n\"We have no government armed with power capable of contending with human passions unbridled by morality and religion,\" Adams said. \"Avarice, ambition, revenge, or gallantry would break the strongest cords of our constitution as a whale goes through a net. Our constitution was made only for a moral and religious people. It is wholly inadequate to the government of any other.\"\n\nThomas Jefferson\n\nThomas Jefferson was just 33 years old when he was given the task of writing the Declaration of Independence. His knowledge of political philosophy, his eloquence as a writer, and his belief in natural rights made him a leader among the patriots.\n\nBut he was not without his political problems. Jefferson's opponents often portrayed him as an infidel and an atheist. But in reality, he was a staunch supporter of the freedom of religion and considered it a very personal matter -- one he often pondered in his writings. The man who gave us the immortal words \"when in the course of human events\" also gave us these reflections on God and his role in freedom. Etched in the marble of the Jefferson Memorial in his honor are these words:\n\n\"...God who gave us life gave us liberty. Can the liberties of a nation be thought secure when we have removed a conviction that these liberties are the gift of God? Indeed I tremble for my country when I reflect God is just, that his justice cannot sleep forever\" (from notes on the state of Virginia).\n\nIn the early 1780s, Jefferson was drafting a plan for future territories of the United States. Much of this plan became incorporated into the Northwest Ordinance of 1787, which established guidelines for territories applying for statehood. Under this law, any new states added to the nation would be recognized as equals with the original 13 states and not as colonies. The ordinance's provisions for the states included self-government, religious tolerance and the prohibition of slavery.\n\nJefferson's belief in the unquestionable relationship between good government and religious freedom is reflected in article three of the Northwest Ordinance, where he writes:\n\n\"Religion, morality and knowledge being necessary to good government and the happiness of mankind, schools and the means of education shall forever be encouraged.\"\n\nNoah Webster\n\nNoah Webster's dictionaries, spellers, and grammars shaped the education of America in the 18th century and his legacy still lives on today. As the author of the first American dictionary and a son of the American Revolution, Webster sought to give the new country a different kind of freedom -- a culture of its own. Webster considered his most important project his revision of the King James Bible. He wanted to make it accessible to every American. He believed God played an important part in the education of the people and in the preservation of the American experiment.\n\nHere is his advice on how to choose the nation's leaders:\n\n\"When you become entitled to exercise the right of voting for public officers, let it be impressed on your mind that God commands you to choose for rulers, just men who will rule in the fear of God. The preservation of a republican government depends on the faithful discharge of this duty; if the citizens neglect their duty, and place unprincipled men in office, the government will soon be corrupted\" (\"Advice to the Young\" from Value of the Bible and Excellence of the Christian Religion, 1834).\n\nBenjamin Franklin\n\nBenjamin Franklin's role in drafting the Declaration of Independence was far from his first invention. This founding father contributed to America both in politics and in science. From almanacs and kite flying to serving as ambassador and statesman, Benjamin Franklin was truly one of the most versatile of America's founding fathers. Franklin's scientific mind also led to many intellectual and philosophical discussions.\n\nAlthough he was not a regular church-goer in his adult life, he expressed the importance of implementing God's moral values in all aspects of life. His writings demonstrate an acknowledgment of God that transcended the scientific mysteries Franklin longed to answer. In 1731 he articulated a creed to live by, both personally and in public life:\n\n\"That there is one God, Father of the universe. That He is infinitely good, powerful, and wise. That He is omnipresent. That He ought to be worshipped, by adoration prayer and thanksgiving both in public and private.\"\n\nIn the summer of 1787, delegates to the Constitutional Convention in Philadelphia had been in bitter debate for ten long weeks. Tempers flared over heated issues between the northern and southern states. As tensions rose, some delegates threatened to pull out of the convention altogether, leaving the fledgling nation without a strong constitution.\n\nWhen it looked like no one would ever be able to agree, the elder statesman of the group took charge. The 81-year-old Franklin stood to his feet. And although he was not known to be devoutly religious, he gave this contentious gathering a stirring call for prayer.\n\n\"I have lived, sir, a long time, and the longer I live, the more convincing proofs I see of this truth, that God governs in the affairs of men. And if a sparrow cannot fall to the ground without His notice, is it probable that an empire can rise without His aid? ... I also believe that without His concurring aid we shall succeed in this political building no better, than the builders of Babel \u2026 Therefore, I beg leave to move that henceforth prayers imploring the assistance of heaven, and its blessings on our deliberations be held in this assembly every morning...\"\n\nBenjamin Rush\n\nBenjamin Rush's impact on America did not stop with his signature on the Declaration of Independence. Although he was a member of the Continental Congress, Rush was also one of the most influential physicians in early America. He served as the Continental Army's Surgeon General during the American Revolution.\n\nUnder President John Adams, Rush was Treasurer of the United States Mint. More notably, the statesman encouraged support for building more African churches in Philadelphia. Rush was convinced this would reduce high black prison populations since many of the convicted served time for stealing food and clothing.\n\nBenjamin Rush's advocacy reflected earlier writings of his beliefs in a strong religious and moral foundation for all people. In 1806 he wrote:\n\n\"The only foundation for a useful education in a republic is to be laid in religion. Without this, there can be no virtue, and without virtue, there can be no liberty, and liberty is the object and life of all republican governments.\"\n\nWilliam Penn\n\nLittle did William Penn know that his vision of establishing a society that was godly, virtuous and exemplary for all would one day birth the freedoms of a nation. After establishing Pennsylvania with land granted by King Charles the second, Penn set out to plan a city called Philadelphia. Years later William Penn's historic city would become the first capital of the United States and out of it the nation's foundational structure would be laid.\n\nAlthough Penn is best remembered for his vision of a democratic government and peaceful co-existence with the native Indians, in 1682, William Penn's beliefs of government fundamentals echo those of biblical principles:\n\n\"It is impossible, Penn wrote, that any people of government should ever prosper, where men render not unto God, that which is God's, as well as to Caesar, that which is Caesar's.\"\n\nJames Wilson\n\nOne of the lesser-known patriots and founding fathers of our nation was Scottish-born James Wilson. The young lawyer's writings on the British Parliament's authority impressed members of the Continental Congress so much they elected him to the body in 1775. The following year, Wilson signed the Declaration of Independence and later the United States Constitution.\n\nServing as a United States Supreme Court Justice until his death, James Wilson realized there was a much higher law than man's to consider. When questioning what the ultimate cause of moral obligation is, Wilson determined, \"I give it this answer, the will of God. This is the supreme law. His just and full right of imposing laws, and our duty in obeying them, are the sources of our moral obligations.\"\n\nGeorge Washington\n\nIn May of 1776, fighting was well underway in the American Revolution. For General George Washington it was a stressful time. Under his command in New York, he had about 7 thousand men. The rag-tag army was poorly trained. They were about to face some thirty thousand soldiers from the most highly trained and successful military force in the world. The Americans were outnumbered and outgunned. As they waited in New York for the onslaught of British military power, Washington issued orders for his troops to pray for the campaign ahead.\n\nOn May 17, 1776, he wrote that that day was, \"...to be observed as a day of fasting humiliation and prayer, humbly to supplicate the mercy of almighty God, that it would please Him to pardon all our manifold sins and transgressions, and to prosper the arms of the united colonies, and finally establish the peace and freedom of America upon a solid and lasting foundation.\"\n\nAfter the Revolution, Washington was elected America's first president. Years later, as he prepared to leave office and return to his beloved Mount Vernon, foremost in his mind was the need for the young nation to stay neutral on foreign issues until it grew stronger. George Washington chose to send this message to the nation in a farewell address -- not in a speech, but in the September 1796 Philadelphia newspapers. In it, the president advised Americans to value the newly formed republic and its constitution. But Washington cautioned that the country's success depended not only on national strength but also on two essential factors:\n\n\"Of all the dispositions and habits which lead to political prosperity, religion, and morality are indispensable supports.\"\n\n*This history-based article was first published before 2012",

        "title": "'We're the Frontline': CBN News Joins Border Sheriff to Show You the Threat to America",
        "body": "SOUTHERN ARIZONA - In the scorching desert of Arizona, one local sheriff is waging war against cartels, human smugglers, and the drugs all crossing the border. CBN News visited the area with him to witness the crisis firsthand.\n\nIt might be 70 miles north of the Mexico-Arizona border, but Pinal County feels like the front lines of the fentanyl crisis. For years, cartels have used this route to smuggle illicit cargo north across the Tohono O'odham Indian Reservation. Since 2017, Pinal County Sheriff Mark Lamb has worked to stop it.\n\nSheriff Lamb told us, \"The reservation starts and then that reservation goes all the way into Mexico. It crosses over the border. So on both sides, you have Mexico and the United States. But the reservation is on both sides. And so they'll push through the reservation. And a lot of times members of that reservation will drive them up to the county line and drop them off.\"\n\n\"And then what they do is they hike up to the I-8 or just on the other side to a place like where I'm going to show you now and then they'll load out their vehicle and take off.\"\n\n\"And these are what you would call the 'Gotaways' or the people that get into the country undetected,\" he said.\n\nCBN News rode along with Sheriff Lamb to see the scale of the problem.\n\n\"So mind you, I could probably show you 100 of these spots,\" he explained.\n\n\"And you see all the residue from the people here, the water jugs, the clothes, the blankets, the camouflage,\" he said. \"That orange twine is the remnants of marijuana. They use the burlap straps to put them to make a backpack. And then they'll use the twine to tie these two packs together.\"\n\nThis vast desert poses a major challenge for Lamb and his deputies to police it all.\n\n\"This is a unique area. We actually have rip crews that will come in these areas and the rip crews are other drug dealers, other criminals that will come and steal the product from these loads whether it's marijuana, the fentanyl, the pills. But lately what they've been stealing and which has more value is humans. So if they're trafficking a load of ten people that are trying to come to America, the rip crews can come and steal them and then go up and extort them for money, put them into the sex trade, make them work for them, do all that,\" he explained.\n\nWATCH OUR EXCLUSIVE REPORT from Arizona BELOW:\n\nThe result is measured in human suffering.\n\n\"These poor people, when we find them, they're darn near dead, just from exhaustion, from what the cartels put them through,\" Sheriff Lamb said.\n\nCBN News traveled to the edge of the Indian reservation, the Tohono O'odham Reservation that goes all the way down across the U.S.-Mexican border. There were piles of clothing everywhere at a drop-off point we observed. But these are not migrants. These are not people who are coming across looking for asylum.\n\nWe know this because the pile includes shoes made of carpet which masks footprints and the sound of walking. We discovered camouflage hats and jackets out here too. These are uniforms with the same hats, obviously purchased at the same place. It's the same kind of camouflage.\n\n***Please sign up for CBN Newsletters and download the CBN News app to ensure you keep receiving the latest news from a distinctly Christian perspective.***\n\nThere were several of these camouflage backpacks also out here. This is what you would expect from a military invasion when people are wearing uniforms that are standardized. These are obviously being funded by the cartels. And instead of carrying weapons, what they're carrying into America is poison.\n\nLamb said, \"We're the frontline. And frankly, they're far more equipped if they decided to actually come over with guns and all their equipment. ...How much military weaponry can you buy with $13 billion a year? They are amassing armies, well, well-equipped armies in Mexico that are going to be very difficult to deal with.\"\n\nSheriff Lamb believes the problem is as much the fault of the U.S. government as it is of the cartels. That's why this sheriff has decided to run for U.S. Senate in 2024.\n\nLamb said, \"This fight, the only way to get rid of these people is to vote them out or to impeach him. And so there is hope. The hope is that every two years we have elections. And this next election is a crucial election because if you don't like this stuff if you don't want these people flowing into America, we've got to get somebody back in there that believes in border security that's actually going to do it, and protect our communities and frankly, protect these people that are being taken advantage of by the cartels.\"",

        "body": "With the 2024 election heating up, attention is turning to official party positions and platforms.\n\nOn Tuesday, a coalition of groups announced the launch of the Platform Integrity Project, an effort to ensure the Republican Party Platform maintains its conservative ideals.\n\nListen to the latest episode of \u201cQuick Start\u201d\n\nA press release from Family Research Council Action (FRC Action), a group that seeks to influence politicians on behalf of faith and family issues, notes the new effort aims to protect the \u201cpro-life, pro-family, and pro-Israel\u201d elements of the Republican Party platform.\n\nFRC Action chairman Tony Perkins, an elected member of the Republican National Committee (RNC) Platform Committee, is at the helm of the Platform Integrity Project.\n\nHe exclusively explained the scope of the effort in a statement shared with CBN News.\n\n\u201cThis coalition seeks to work with the RNC and the Trump campaign for an open process that will help ensure the preservation of the GOP\u2019s solidly conservative platform that contains longstanding pro-life, pro-family, and pro-Israel planks,\u201d the statement read. \u201cThis effort will, for the first time, score individual votes of platform delegates.\u201d\n\nWATCH: Tony Perkins Announces Major Effort to 'Protect' New GOP Platform\n\nThe announcement comes amid concerns moderate Republicans could try to dilute the more conservative planks of the platform.\n\nPerkins said party platforms are incredibly important as they highlight a party\u2019s priorities and principles, with past data suggesting lawmakers tend to stick closely to the ideals in their associated platforms.\n\nHe added that FRC Action is teaming up with other groups like WallBuilders, Faith Wins, Family Policy Alliance, and Palmetto Family Council, among others, to launch the Platform Integrity Project and ensure clear and concise ideals are communicated about \u201clife, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness.\u201d\n\n\u201cAmerica is an unprecedented place of moral and cultural confusion and is in dire need of leadership and moral clarity,\u201d Perkins said. \u201cVoters need to see a contrast between the two parties on their policy priorities. Voters want and need a choice.\u201d\n\nHe continued, \u201cThe message to Platform Committee delegates is clear: preserve life and family values in the Republican Party platform so that social conservatives can continue to find a home in the GOP.\u201d\n\nThe Platform Integrity Project comes amid fears the Republican Party and Trump campaign could end up watering down or removing some of the more conservative ideals in the GOP platform.\n\nThis is particularly pronounced in the wake of the Dobbs decision, which overturned Roe v. Wade and returned abortion laws to the states. This will be the first party platform that must contend with the new realities surrounding the Supreme Court\u2019s monumental move.\n\nPerkins\u2019 campaign is imploring people to sign up and encourage delegates and officials who will be meeting July 8-9 to draft the new GOP Party Platform to stand by traditional party values.\n\n\u201cMay God give them wisdom and discernment as they meet, evaluate important ideas, and vote on policies,\u201d text on the Platform Integrity Project website reads. \u201cMay they have great understanding and clarity as they address the critical and sometimes complex issues facing our nation.\u201d\n\nFind out more about the Platform Integrity Project.\n\n***As the number of voices facing big-tech censorship continues to grow, please sign up for Faithwire\u2019s daily newsletter and download the CBN News app, to stay up-to-date with the latest news from a distinctly Christian perspective.***",

He had also texted his pastor that he had been surrounded by Muslims.\n\nThe group\u2019s anger might have been sparked by the evangelist\u2019s success in the Butebo District, where he preached door-to-door, to convert Muslims to Christianity.\n\nThe pastor he texted detailed some of this to Morning Star News.\n\n\u201cThe evening of June 17, I received a short message from Malinga of being surrounded by the Muslims,\u201d the preacher said. \u201cI wrote back to him several times, but there was no response.\u201d\n\nThe local resident who found Malinga\u2019s body reportedly found his phone and called the pastor, who then informed the police about the murder.\n\nAuthorities are reportedly investigating the killing as friends and loved ones mourn.\n\n\u201cWe as a church are very saddened for losing our active, devoted, and committed evangelist who won many people, including Muslims, to Christianity,\u201d the preacher said.\n\nAccording to Voice of the Martyrs, Uganda is a majority Christian nation, but Islamic extremism is still at work within its borders. This has led to discrimination, persecution, and other chaos. These issues are particularly problematic for Muslims who convert to Christianity.\n\n\u201cRadical Islam\u2019s influence has grown steadily, and many Christians within the majority Muslim border regions are facing severe persecution, especially those who convert from Islam,\u201d the persecution watchdog notes. \u201cDespite the risks, many churches in Uganda have responded by reaching out to their neighbors; many churches are training leaders how to share the Gospel with Muslims and care for those who are persecuted after they become Christians.\u201d\n\nAs CBN News previously reported, Twaha Namwoyo, 38, and Nadiimu Katooko, 27, were a husband and wife and the parents of four children in the Ugandan village of Bulalaka. They were killed earlier this year just two months after converting to Christianity.

        "body": "Reactions to the U.S. Supreme Court's ruling granting limited immunity to occupants of the Oval Office came swift and strong.\n\nPresident Biden condemned it as a \"dangerous precedent.\"\n\nFormer President Trump called it a \"big win for the Constitution.\"\n\nIn addition to its historical impact, the ruling also affects an election interference case against Trump.\n\nFor the first time in its 235-year history, the court clarified the issue of presidential immunity, ruling 6-3 that presidents have absolute immunity for official acts and presumptive immunity for official actions taken outside the parameter of the explicit duties of the office.\n\nPresident Trump brought the case to the high court, contending he had absolute immunity from criminal charges based on his official acts as president on January 6, 2021.\n\n\"You're not going to do anything (as president) if you don't have immunity because otherwise, you're going to be prosecuted after you leave office,\" he said.\n\nA majority of the justices agreed.\n\nChief Justice John Roberts delivered the court's opinion: \"The nature of presidential power entitles a former president to absolute immunity from criminal prosecution for actions within his conclusive and preclusive constitutional authority. And he is entitled to at least presumptive immunity from prosecution for all his official acts. There is no immunity for unofficial acts.\"\n\n\"The court, in a rather complicated way, carved out various levels of immunity that a president might enjoy,\" said Claire Wofford, Associate Professor of Political Science at the College of Charleston.\n\nImmediately after the ruling was announced, Trump posted on Truth Social: \"Big win for our Constitution and democracy. Proud to be an American!\"\n\nIn an address to the nation on Monday night, President Biden claimed the ruling means there are no limits on what a president can do.\n\n\"This is a fundamentally new principle and it's a dangerous precedent,\" he said. \"Because the power of the office will no longer be constrained by the law, even by the Supreme Court of the United States. The only limits will be self-imposed by the president alone.\"\n\nThe ruling kicks the January 6th case down to the U.S. federal District Court and it puts the burden on Special Prosecutor Jack Smith to prove the former president acted unofficially and with criminal motivation as a candidate for president.\n\nThat will be hard to prove because the Supreme Court said his contacts with the Department of Justice and Vice President Pence to overturn the election took place as official acts within the president's authority.\n\n***Please sign up for CBN Newsletters and download the CBN News app to ensure you keep receiving the latest news from a distinctly Christian perspective.***\n\nWhen Trump's lawyers presented arguments before the court last April, Justice Sonya Sotomayor asked if there should be any limits on presidential actions. \"If the president decides his rival is a corrupt person and he orders the military or orders someone else to assassinate him, is that within his official acts for which he can get immunity?\"\n\nJustices Kagan and Jackson agreed with Sotomayor voting against the majority's decision.\n\nIn the dissent, Sotomayor wrote: \"Today's decision to grant former presidents criminal immunity reshapes the institution of the presidency. It makes a mockery of the principle, foundational to our Constitution and system of government, that no man is above the law...the court gives former President Trump all the immunity he asked for and more.\"\n\nLegal experts agree this unprecedented, historic ruling will have far-reaching implications not only for Donald Trump but for future presidents as well.\n\n\n\nIt also means Jack Smith's January 6th case against the former president will likely be delayed until after the November election.\n\nAnd President Trump is now citing the ruling in an attempt to overturn his conviction in New York last month, despite those acts being committed before he was president.\n\nWATCH Our LIVE Analysis: Supreme Court Decision on Presidential Immunity",

        "body": "JERUSALEM, Israel \u2013 Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu argues that the Israeli Defense Forces are destroying Hamas' ability to strike as an army. But many of the terrorists have escaped, and he acknowledges the IDF will have to keep chasing them down all over Gaza.\n\nAs Netanyahu puts it, \u201cWe are nearing the end of the elimination phase of Hamas\u2019s terrorist army. There will be a continuation of hitting its remnants.\u201d\n\nNetanyahu added he expects to achieve the war's goals, \u201cTo return our hostages, to eliminate the military and governmental capabilities of Hamas, to ensure that Gaza does not pose a threat, and even more than that to return our residents both in the south and in the north safely to their homes.\u201d\n\nHad to Evacuate Six Times\n\nThe IDF has destroyed much of Khan Younis, a huge suburb of Rafah, in earlier pitched battles to wipe Hamas out there. But many of the surviving terrorists have recently fled from Rafah to Khan Younis. So the IDF is having to order the civilians there -- many who are already evacuees from other areas \u2013 to evacuate once again so they don't get mowed down in the renewed fighting.\n\nOne bedraggled and angry woman said as she fled with her family, \"Here we are going to look for a place to evacuate to. I've been displaced six times from Rafah.\"\n\nIt appears the Biden administration continues to demand how the Israelis should conduct this war. With so much of Gaza bombed and in ruins, it's thought many Palestinians living there might well be better off moving elsewhere. But the U.S. is telling Israel it must eventually let all Gazans settle back permanently in Gaza.\n\n\n\nAs State Department spokesperson Vedant Patel stated, \"There can be no permanent displacement of Gazans.\"\n\nWhat the Biden Administration Finds Unacceptable\n\nAnd the Biden administration is saying the Israelis must make sure after the war there is an Arab-led civilian government set up in Gaza. Some in the Jewish nation think it can't really be safe from Gaza unless there's some form of Israeli occupation to make sure terrorists can't rise to power again there.\n\nBut U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken insists anything less than Arabs back in charge is one of three things unacceptable to the Biden administration.\n\nHe states, \"We know that there are three things that are unacceptable for Gaza's future. An Israeli occupation, Hamas perpetuating its leadership, or chaos, anarchy, lawlessness - which is what we're seeing in big parts of Gaza today.\"\n\n\n\nAt the same time Blinken is dictating to Israel what is or is not acceptable, he also has harsh words for Hamas leader Yahya Sinwar and his refusal to say \"yes\" to a ceasefire that could bring hostages home and end the violent war.\n\nBlinken explained, \"Right now, in not saying yes, Mr. Sinwar is not only holding on to the Israeli, American and other hostages, he's continuing to make a hostage of Palestinian children, women, and men, who are caught in a horrific crossfire of Hamas' making.\"\n\nWar Between Israel and Hezbollah\n\nBlinken also addressed the possibility of war between Israel and Hezbollah saying, \u201cOn the one hand, no one wants a war. On the other hand, you have forces, momentum that may be leading in that direction, in which we are determined to try to arrest.\n\nBlinken noted about the thousands of Israeli evacuees, \"You have 60,000 or so Israelis out of their homes in northern Israel. Israel has essentially lost sovereignty in that part of the country because people don\u2019t feel safe going to their homes.\u201d\n\nSuing Iran, Syria & North Korea for $4,000,000,000\n\nVictims who survived Hamas' brutal assault on Israel on October 7th are suing Iran, Syria, and North Korea for four billion dollars. They accuse those countries of giving Hamas the money, weapons, and other assistance that made the deadly October 7th attack possible.\n\nAnti-Defamation League Director Jonathan Greenblatt announced the legal action, \u201cThis lawsuit on behalf of more than a hundred Americans who are affected by this attack will indeed ensure that there are consequences to be brought for the bloodiest day experienced by the Jewish people since the Holocaust.\u201d\n\nOn another front, Prime Minister Netanyahu has publicly rejected the Palestinian Authority having a role in ruling Gaza after the war. Many Israelis feel the PA \u2013 just like Hamas \u2013 wants to see the Jewish nation destroyed and is fomenting that in Judea and Samaria, the so-called West Bank. But it appears Netanyahu may be softening a bit and ready to let lower-level PA workers take part in governing Gaza. Yet that would be only as long as they've been thoroughly vetted by Israel first.\n\nRescued Daughter at Mother's Side\n\nIn sad news, Liora Argamani, the mother of Noa Argamani, passed away. Liora suffered from terminal brain cancer and had hoped to see her daughter Noa before she died. Hamas terrorists kidnapped Noa from the Nova Music Festival, and she spent eight months in captivity before being rescued by IDF special forces in a daring raid last month. The rescue allowed Noa to be with her mother during Liora's last days.",
        "summary": "JERUSALEM, Israel \u2013 Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu argues that the Israeli Defense Forces are destroying Hamas' ability to strike as an army.\nBut many of the terrorists have escaped, and he acknowledges the IDF will have to keep chasing them down all over Gaza.\nAs Netanyahu puts it, \u201cWe are nearing the end of the elimination phase of Hamas\u2019s terrorist army.\nWar Between Israel and HezbollahBlinken also addressed the possibility of war between Israel and Hezbollah saying, \u201cOn the one hand, no one wants a war.\nHamas terrorists kidnapped Noa from the Nova Music Festival, and she spent eight months in captivity before being rescued by IDF special forces in a daring raid last month.",

        "title": "Ray Comfort's Surprising Reaction to ACLU's Ten Commandments Lawsuit",
        "body": "Preacher Ray Comfort is praising an unlikely party: the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU).\n\nComfort, known for his viral videos and engaging Gospel-sharing, recently sent a gift basket to the civil rights group after the organization sued Lousiana over its decision to become the first U.S. state to mandate the Ten Commandments be displayed in public school classrooms.\n\nListen to the latest episode of \u201cQuick Start\u201d\n\nRather than deride the ACLU, Comfort offered a \u201cthank you\u201d for giving massive and renewed cultural attention to the famed biblical commandments.\n\n\u201cThe ACLU, in wanting to sue the state of Louisiana, have done us a great favor,\u201d he told CBN News. \u201cTheir lawsuit was big news in the secular media, and so the Ten Commandments have featured from Newsweek to Time magazine, USA Today, to The New York Times, CNN, MSNBC, NBC, ABC, Fox, on huge podcasts, \u2018The View,\u2019 all throughout social media, and comedian Jimmy Kimmel even quoted all of the Ten Commandments to his massive viewing audience. You can\u2019t buy that sort of publicity!\u201d\n\nConsidering this inadvertent \u201cgift,\u201d Comfort decided to send the ACLU a large basket filled with chocolate and a thank-you card.\n\nThat card included a message that read, \u201cThank you for publicizing The Ten Commandments. America needs to be reminded of God\u2019s Law, and you\u2019ve certainly done that. Very grateful.\u201d\n\nThe ACLU reportedly hasn\u2019t responded to the gesture and note, but Comfort said he doesn\u2019t expect the organization to do so. Comfort has long advocated for Christians \u2014 and humans more generally \u2014 to pay attention to the Ten Commandments and implement these moral truths into their lives.\n\nHe told CBN News that Americans today can learn a great deal by studying biblical Israel and understanding its timeless parallels to our current situation.\n\n\u201cAmerica is no different than Israel in the Old Testament who forgot the Ten Commandments, and consequently gave themselves to sin,\u201d Comfort said. \u201cAnd the reason they did so was because of the sin of \u2018idolatry.'\u201d\n\nHe continued, \u201cWhen we forsake the Law that forbids making up false gods and committing adultery, we tend to make up our own congenial image of God and run headlong into sexual sin. And that\u2019s what\u2019s happened to the United States.\u201d\n\nComfort believes the only catalyst for awakening Americans to their national sin is a \u201cfresh look at the Ten Commandments.\u201d In fact, Comfort\u2019s ministry, Living Waters, has spent four decades teaching Christians about the importance of the Ten Commandments and equipping them to share the Gospel.\n\nComfort said he would love to see every school in the U.S. display the Ten Commandments, but noted he believes too many people are \u201cbrainwashed into believing in the fallacy of \u2018separation of church and state.'\u201d\n\nAs CBN News previously reported, the ACLU is suing after Louisiana Republican Gov. Jeff Landry signed H.B. 71 into law, meaning every classroom from kindergarten to the university level, which receives state funding, would be required to display the commandments \u201con a poster or framed document that is at least 11 inches by 14 inches.\u201d\n\nThe effort, slated to be privately funded, will require a poster-sized display accompanied by a four-paragraph explanation offering context. The text will note that the Ten Commandments \u201cwere a prominent part of American public education for almost three centuries.\u201d\n\nThese classroom posters are due to be posted by the start of 2025.\n\nThe ACLU, its Lousiana branch, the atheist-led Freedom From Religion Foundation, Americans United for Separation of Church and State, and nine Lousiana families joined forces to challenge the law. CBN News will continue to cover the case as it unfolds.\n\nMost recently, Living Waters released the \u201cTrump/Biden Million Dollar Bill,\u201d a free tract leading up to the U.S. election in November. It can be ordered here.\n\n***As the number of voices facing big-tech censorship continues to grow, please sign up for Faithwire\u2019s daily newsletter and download the CBN News app, to stay up-to-date with the latest news from a distinctly Christian perspective.***",

        "body": "Is This a Climate Emergency? These Horrific Weather Events from Long Ago Tell the True Story\n\nThe phrase \"extreme heat\" is being used over and over in news coverage as if to signal that a climate emergency has arrived.\n\nWe're told 2023 is on track to be the hottest year on record, while two-thirds of Americans in a PBS/Marist Poll now say climate change is affecting the weather.\n\nDenver resident Mike Barela said, \"People are starting to realize that there is an effect.\" Miami resident Stephen Escudero said, \"This definitely feels like we're in that point of no return that people have talked about for a long time.\"\n\nSome have called on President Biden to declare a 'climate emergency' amid searing summer temperatures. And UN Secretary-General Ant\u00f3nio Guterres has called for immediate action on climate change, saying, \"The era of global warming has ended; the era of global boiling has arrived.\"\n\nWeather history, however, tells a different story \u2013 that the worst weather events, including the hottest years, have all been in the past.\n\n\n\nThe worst hurricane in history? The Great Hurricane of 1780, which killed over 20,000 people in the Caribbean.\n\n\n\nThe worst wildfire in U.S. history? The Peshtigo Fire in Wisconsin in 1871 killed at least 1,500 people and burned over a million acres.\n\nThe worst flood in world history was in 1931 \u2013 the Yangtze River Flood in China, which killed almost 4 million people.\n\nThe worst flood in U.S. history was in 1889, in Johnston, Pennsylvania.\n\n\n\nThe deadliest tornado in recorded U.S. history was in 1925. The Tri-State Tornado, which struck Missouri, Illinois, and Indiana, killing some 700 people.\n\nAnd the hottest year was not 2023, but 1936. In 1936, 21 states had their all-time temperature records.\n\n\n\nSteve Milloy of Junkscience.com said, \"We know in the United States that the 1930s were extremely hot \u2013 1936 is the hottest year on record in the United States and probably throughout the northern Hemisphere.\"\n\nSome northern cities saw temperatures between 115 and 120 degrees that year. Many thousands died across the country and the resulting Dust Bowl forced the migration of 3 and half million climate refugees out of the Great Plains and Midwest.\n\nThere is no dispute that the Earth has been warming incrementally since an extremely cold period known as Little Ice Age ended in 1850.\n\n\n\nBut Weatherbell Chief Forecaster Joe Bastardi blames this summer's sweltering temperatures on a huge amount of water vapor created by an immense underwater volcanic eruption in Tonga last year that was 1,000 times more powerful than the nuclear bomb dropped on Hiroshima, and by warming oceans.\n\nBastardi told us, \"There's been an increase in what we call geothermal spreading since the early 1990s. And what it does is it develops a cumulative buildup of heat in the oceans, which then has to be released through the El Ninos, which then puts all sort of water vapor in the air, which then leads to the warming that you're seeing. It's all water vapor.\"\n\n\n\nThere have also been record-breaking cold temperatures this summer, but that weather news is ignored.\n\nFlorida Governor Ron DeSantis reminded reporters Sunday that while Hurricane Idalia was very damaging, it paled in comparison to the Category 5 Labor Day storm of 1935, which had peak winds of 200 miles per hour and killed more than 400 people.\n\n\u201cThere were people that got caught up in the storm that their clothes got ripped off their bodies, that the wind was so strong. So I think that the notion that somehow, hurricanes are something new that's just false and, and we've got to stop politicizing the weather and stop politicizing natural disasters,\" DeSantis said at a post-hurricane press conference.\n\nMilloy says, \"It's a very complicated issue that the alarmists just like want to boil down to 'fossil fuel use is destroying the planet.' The whole climate is a lot more complicated.\n\nSummers in the U.S. are supposed to be hot, something even the Babylon Bee noticed: Global Warming Mysteriously Spikes Every Year Between June And August, Experts Say\n\n* The video in this story first aired in 2023",

A U.S. district court has ruled that CEF Bible clubs must be provided equal opportunity as other clubs throughout the island state.\n\nLiberty Counsel filed the case against the Hawaii State Department of Education after the continual rejection of Good News Club over a span of three years.\n\nVICTORY! We received a preliminary injunction on behalf of Child Evangelism Fellowship of Hawaii and its Good News Clubs for after school Bible clubs to be given equal access as similarly situated clubs on public school campuses across Hawaii. See morehttps://t.co/pGXN8hhXK8 \u2014 Liberty Counsel (@libertycounsel) June 28, 2024\n\nCBN News reported previously that CEF Hawaii had submitted applications to host Good News Clubs in several schools, including Nu'uanu Elementary, Lincoln Elementary, Waimea Elementary, Kalihi Waena Elementary, Kohala Elementary School, and Pearl City Elementary. All submissions were continually denied by the state's Department of Education (DOE).\n\n\n\nWhile the Hawaii DOE argued that the prohibition of these clubs was based on \"misappropriation of school policies,\" CEF argued that their decision reflected \"blatant religious discrimination.\"\n\n\n\nIn a reply brief filed back in April, the legal organization explained that the department chose \"silence\" over correcting \"unequal and unconstitutional treatment\" by its own officials.\n\n\n\nThe awarded preliminary injunction serves as a big win for religious freedom within schools in Hawaii.\n\nLiberty Counsel Founder and Chairman Mat Staver said, \"This is a great victory for Child Evangelism Fellowship, parents, and the students in Hawaii public schools. The U.S. Supreme Court has ruled that public schools cannot discriminate against Christian viewpoints regarding use of school facilities. Child Evangelism Fellowship gives children a safe space that offers moral and character development from a Christian viewpoint. Good News Clubs should be in every public elementary school.\"\n\nGood News Clubs, which meet weekly, are led by community volunteers. These clubs encourage learning, service, and spiritual growth while also existing to help develop a child's social skills, leadership skills, emotional well-being and character.\n\n***Please sign up for CBN Newsletters and download the CBN News app to ensure you keep receiving the latest news from a distinctly Christian perspective.***",

        "title": "Beryl Makes Landfall as Category 4 Hurricane on Caribbean Island",
        "body": "SAN JUAN, Puerto Rico (AP) - A dangerous and extremely powerful Hurricane Beryl made landfall Monday on the Caribbean island of Carriacou after becoming the earliest storm of Category 4 strength to form in the Atlantic, fueled by record warm waters.\n\nWinds up to 150 mph (240 kph), just shy of a Category 5 storm, blew off roofs, uprooted trees and caused other damage on Carriacou, one of the islands of Grenada, and elsewhere in the southeast Caribbean.\n\n\u201cThis is an extremely dangerous and life-threatening situation,\u201d the National Hurricane Center said.\n\nHurricane warnings were in effect for Barbados, Grenada, Tobago and St. Vincent and the Grenadines as thousands of people hunkered down in homes and shelters. The last strong hurricane to hit the southeast Caribbean was Hurricane Ivan 20 years ago, which killed dozens of people in Grenada.\n\nNBC Radio in St. Vincent and the Grenadines said it received reports of roofs being torn off churches and schools as communications began collapsing across the southeast Caribbean.\n\nIn nearby Grenada, officials received \u201creports of devastation\u201d from Carriacou and surrounding islands, said Terence Walters, Grenada\u2019s national disaster coordinator. Prime Minister Dickon Mitchell said he would travel to Carriacou as soon as it\u2019s safe, noting that there\u2019s been an \u201cextensive\u201d storm surge.\n\nGrenada officials had to evacuate patients to a lower floor after hospital roof was damaged, he said.\n\n\u201cThere is the likelihood of even greater damage,\u201d he told reporters. \u201cWe have no choice but to continue to pray.\u201d\n\nLater on Monday morning, Beryl was about 30 miles (50 kilometers) north of the island of Grenada, moving west-northwest at 20 mph (31 kph).\n\nIn Barbados, officials received more than a dozen reports of roof damage, fallen trees and downed electric posts across the island, said Kerry Hinds, emergency management director. Wilfred Abrahams, minister of home affairs and information, said drones - which are faster than crews fanning across the island - would assess damage once Beryl passes.\n\nA tropical storm warning was in effect for St. Lucia, Martinique and Trinidad. A tropical storm watch was issued for Haiti\u2019s entire southern coast, and from Punta Palenque in the Dominican Republic west to the border with Haiti. A hurricane watch was issued for Jamaica.\n\nForecasters warned of a life-threatening storm surge of up to 9 feet (3 meters) in areas where Beryl made landfall, with 3 to 6 inches (7.6 to 15 centimeters) of rain for Barbados and nearby islands and possibly 10 inches in some areas (25 centimeters), especially in Grenada and the Grenadines.\n\nThe storm was expected to weaken slightly over the Caribbean Sea on a path that would take it just south of Jamaica and later toward Mexico\u2019s Yucatan Peninsula as a Category 1.\n\n\u201cBeryl is forecast to remain a significant hurricane during its entire trek across the Caribbean region,\u201d the National Hurricane Center said.\n\nOfficials in some southeast Caribbean islands announced controlled power outages and warned of water cuts ahead of the storm, as well as landslides and flash floods. Schools, airports and government offices shuttered.\n\nBeryl strengthened from a tropical depression to a major hurricane in just 42 hours - a feat accomplished only six other times in Atlantic hurricane history, and with Sept. 1 as the earliest date, according to hurricane expert Sam Lillo.\n\nIt also was the earliest Category 4 Atlantic hurricane on record, besting Hurricane Dennis, which became a Category 4 storm on July 8, 2005.\n\n\u201cThis is a dangerous hurricane for the Windward Islands,\" said hurricane specialist and storm surge expert Michael Lowry. Beryl amassed its strength from record warm waters that are hotter now than they would be at the peak of hurricane season in September, he said.\n\nBeryl is the second named storm in the Atlantic hurricane season, which runs from June 1 to Nov. 30. Earlier this month, Tropical Storm Alberto made landfall in northeast Mexico and killed four people.\n\nThe National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration predicts the 2024 hurricane season is likely to be well above average, with between 17 and 25 named storms. The forecast calls for as many as 13 hurricanes and four major hurricanes.\n\nAn average Atlantic hurricane season produces 14 named storms, seven of them hurricanes and three major hurricanes.\n\nCopyright 2024 The Associated Press.

        "body": "The U.S. Supreme Court has released its decision regarding presidential immunity in the case involving President Trump's actions on January 6, 2021.\n\nWhile the court did issue some major rulings about immunity, the justices chose not to rule directly in Trump's specific case, kicking it back down to the lower courts. That move will delay special counsel Jack Smith's criminal case against Trump, likely pushing it until after the November election.\n\nIn its Trump v. United States ruling, the high court said the lower courts simply hadn't finished the job yet.\n\nChief Justice John Roberts explained, \"The lower courts rendered their decisions on a highly expedited basis\" and \"did not analyze the conduct alleged in the indictment to decide which of it should be categorized as official and which unofficial,\" according to SCOTUSblog.\n\nHistoric Ruling on Presidential Immunity\n\nThe Supreme Court did make several statements about immunity that those lower courts will need to apply to Trump\u2019s case.\n\nIn a historic ruling, the justices declared that former presidents have absolute immunity from prosecution for their official acts based on core constitutional powers. But they also declared, \"There is no immunity for unofficial acts.\"\n\nTrump has claimed that he acted in his official duties as president when he challenged the certification of the 2020 election on January 6 and should be immune from prosecution.\n\nIt's not entirely clear how the ruling will affect the Jack Smith case, but the decision has been widely labeled as a victory for Trump in the broader sense.\n\nMORE: What Will Supreme Court's Presidential Immunity Decision Mean for Trump Case?\n\n\"It's a very big win for former President Trump. Recognizing for the first time this sort of immunity of ex-presidents from criminal prosecution,\" said Prof. Kate Shaw of the University of Pennsylvania Carey Law School.\n\nWATCH LIVE CBN News ANALYSIS: Supreme Court Rules on Presidential Immunity\n\nBefore the ruling, Bradley Jacob, Associate Dean at Regent University Law School, predicted Donald Trump's criminal trials likely will not be dismissed.\n\n\"Maybe a few of the allegations, a few of the indictments will be thrown out. But by and large, I think you're going to see continued movement towards the trials of President Trump, but probably not fast enough to reach any conclusions before the election,\" Jacob said.\n\n***Please sign up for CBN Newsletters and download the CBN News app to ensure you keep receiving the latest news from a distinctly Christian perspective.***",

Rather, they said, it was a \u201ctargeted\u201d assault.

        "title": "Feeling Blue? Instead of Reaching for Junk Food, Try Something Healthier",
        "body": "Feeling Blue? Instead of Reaching for Junk Food, Try Something Healthier\n\nWhen we feel stressed out, depressed, or otherwise unhappy, many of us tend to reach for comfort foods like ice cream, macaroni and cheese, or fried chicken, to feel better. Doctors say while these dishes stimulate the pleasure center in our brains giving us instant satisfaction, in the long run, they can actually harm our mental health.\n\nSugar is the Enemy\n\nPsychiatrist Daniel Amen, author of Change Your Brain Every Day, told CBN News our diet plays a major role in how well our brain functions. The types of foods and drinks we consume directly contribute to the way we think and feel through a complex system of neurotransmitters, hormones, and more.\n\n\"Sugar is the enemy of brain health,\" Dr. Amen said. \"Sugar is pro-inflammatory, and inflammation is clearly associated with depression.\"\n\nDr. Amen says good mental health begins with minimizing the consumption of junk foods like sugary, processed foods and drinks that are loaded with chemical additives and lack fiber and other nutrients.\n\n\"We reach for things that help us feel better now, but not later,\" he said.\n\nDr. Amen said a brain-healthy diet consists of 70% fruits and vegetables and 30% good protein, like pasture-raised chicken and healthy fats like salmon and olive oil.\n\n\"Brain and mental health, just like spiritual health, is a daily practice,\" he said.\n\nThe Gut-Brain Connection\n\nPsychiatrist UmaNaidoo, author of This is Your Brain on Food: An Indispensable Guide to the Surprising Foods that Fight Depression, PTSD, ADHD, Anxiety, OCD, and More, told CBN News the brain and the intestines are linked by the vagus nerve.\n\n\"These two organ systems start from the exact same cells in the human embryo. And so they are inextricably connected throughout our lives,\" she said.\n\nDr. Naidoo says research shows mental health can be improved by increasing the good bacteria in the gut and minimizing the bad bacteria. She said for better or worse, these tiny organisms play a major role in the way we think and feel.\n\n\"The way that we eat is not just about our weight or our waistline,\" said Dr. Naidoo, \"it's also about our mental well-being.\"\n\nDr. Naidoo points out that a gut-healthy diet is high in fruits and vegetables, whole grains, and healthy fats and contains very few processed foods and sugar.\n\nDr. Naidoo says a healthy diet is not usually meant to replace prescription medication for people suffering from mental health disorders but can often offer additional benefits beyond drugs.\n\n\"I would never suggest eliminating or removing one form of treatment, because as a psychiatrist I've seen those can be very valuable, in fact, life-saving to some individuals,\" she said. \"So this is really meant to be an additional tool in your toolkit.\"\n\nHowever, she said many patients who were struggling with mental health issues like depression and anxiety but not taking medication saw their conditions improve just with diet alone.\n\n\"I see it all the time. I will get calls and emails coming back at me saying, 'I'm feeling calmer, I'm sleeping better,'\" she said. \"People notice the difference.\"\n\nTailor-Made Diets\n\nDr. Naidoo said while a generally healthy diet can help people with just about every type of mental health problem, there are specific recommendations for certain diagnoses.\n\nFor example, Dr. Naidoo said people with ADD, ADHD, or people who experience difficulty focusing should eat a healthy breakfast every day. She said while intermittent fasting can be helpful for some, people with difficulty focusing should avoid fasting in the morning and instead consume a meal rich in polyphenols, such as those found in green tea, coffee, berries, cherries, kale, and chia seeds.\n\nShe said people with OCD or anxiety issues should consider avoiding too many glutamates, which are often found in seemingly healthy foods like tomato sauce, fish sauce, and miso. Glutamates are amino acids that act as neurotransmitters that are deeply intertwined with OCD symptoms.\n\n***BRAIN HEALTHY RECIPES***\n\nBaked Salmon with Walnut Kale Pesto\n\nServings: 1 (8 servings of pesto)\n\nPrep Time: 5 minutes\n\nCooking Time: 15 minutes\n\nFor the fish:\n\n1 (4-6 ounce) salmon fillet, boneless and skinless\n\n2 Tablespoons olive oil\n\n1/2 teaspoon kosher salt\n\n1/4 teaspoon black pepper\n\nFor the pesto:\n\n1/4 cup olive oil\n\n1/4 cup grated Parmesan cheese\n\n1 clove garlic, peeled and microwaved for 30 seconds\n\n2 cups baby kale, washed and chopped\n\n1/4 cup walnuts\n\n1 teaspoon lemon juice\n\n1/2 teaspoon salt\n\nPrepare the fish:\n\nPreheat the oven to 350 degrees F and line a baking sheet with parchment paper.

Add the hot sauce and serve over brown rice.\n\nOven-Roasted Miso-Glazed Sweet Potatoes\n\nServings: 8\n\nPrep Time: 20 minutes\n\nCooking Time: 25 minutes\n\n1/2 cup white miso paste\n\n1/4 cup olive oil\n\n1/4 Tablespoon kosher salt\n\n1/4 teaspoon black pepper\n\n4 medium sweet potatoes, unpeeled, sliced into discs\n\nPreheat the oven to 425 degrees F and line a sheet pan with parchment paper.\n\nMix the miso paste, olive oil, salt, and pepper in a large bowl. Toss in the sweet potatoes and combine. Place the sweet potatoes on a sheet pan, making sure they are arranged in a single layer.

It's a bad night,\" Pelosi said.\n\nBut a new CBS/YouGov poll shows 72% of voters believe Biden does not have the mental and cognitive health to serve as president.\n\nEven the former White House photographer weighed in, posting on Instagram \"It's time for Joe to go\" and telling Axios, \"The debate was not the first bad day, and it's not gonna be the last.\"\n\nDemocratic strategists admit there is no way to change the party's nominee unless Biden himself steps aside.\n\nThe Biden campaign says that would lead to chaos.\n\nTrump supporters offered their opinions to CBN News at a rally in Virginia on Friday.\n\nLauren Euhus said, \"I think at this point it's kind of a lost cause.\"\n\nRie Sadler said, \"I think we started to see really how badly Joe's in decline and it's just sad.\"\n\nToday, the Trump campaign is expecting a Supreme Court ruling on his claim to presidential immunity, which could shield him from criminal prosecution.",

        "body": "Israel, Other Allies Concerned About US Projection of Weakness from Biden Debate Performance\n\nJERUSALEM, Israel \u2013 After President Joe Biden's shocking debate performance Thursday, Israelis are alarmed, as are many other allies. They worry evil actors on the world stage might take advantage of the world's greatest superpower being led by a frail, weak, commander-in-chief.\n\nIf America's Leader is Frail & Weak, Will Israel's Enemies Choose Now to Strike Harder?\n\nAs columnist Amnon Lord put it in Israel Hayom, \u201cIn a world rife with aggressive forces, the unflattering image of an American president \u2013 the leader of the free world \u2013 appearing weak and incoherent encourages them to exploit opportunities.\u201d\n\nIsraeli columnist Nadav Eyal added in Yediot Ahronot, \"Weakness is not a trait that an American president can convey, by any means.\"\n\nSen. John Barrasso (R-WY) expressed similar worries on Fox News this weekend, saying, \"It's what foreign leaders \u2013 our enemies \u2013 saw in that debate, in China, Russia, Iran, North Korea. Right now are they thinking, 'This is our moment of opportunity?'\"\n\nBiden Administration Accused of Still Withholding 7 Weapons Systems from Israel\n\nIsraeli Defense Minister Yoav Gallant told Israel Defense Forces in northern Israel this weekend it's their military might that may intimidate Hezbollah enough that it will halt its daily attacks in the region and negotiate a peace deal.\n\nGallant declared the nation is readying either for war or for peace, noting Israel is \"preparing the military force, defense, attack, and this can happen quickly. On the other hand, the political alternative is being prepared. It is always preferable. We are not looking for war, but we are ready for it.\"\n\nHe added, \"The thing that gives us the flexibility to be able to discuss political solutions is that we have military solutions.\"\n\nBut as Israel may soon face war with Hezbollah and its more than 150,000 missiles, one highly-placed U.S. lawmaker says the Biden administration is still withholding seven weapons systems from the Jewish Nation.\n\nOn Fox News Sunday, Rep. Michael McCaul (R-TX), who chairs the powerful House Foreign Affairs Committee revealed, \u201cThis is what is most disturbing to me, is that we\u2019re withholding weapon systems that I have signed off on and Congress has appropriated with the intent of sending those weapons to Israel.\u201d\n\n'Hamas Is the Only Obstacle'\n\nNoa Argamani, one of those four Israeli hostages rescued in Gaza recently, is speaking out. She's reminding the nation that so many hostages remain in captivity.\n\nIn a video, she implored, \"We can't forget about the hostages who are still in Hamas captivity, and we must do everything possible to bring them back home.\"\n\nIsraeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu is pointing out that no hostage deal can currently be worked out because Hamas refuses to deal.\n\nAs he put it, \u201cAnd today everyone knows a simple truth: Hamas is the only obstacle to the release of our hostages.\"\n\nHamas claims the problem is that Israel won't agree to end the war and remove all its troops from Gaza. \"Without this being achieved, all that is presented is just a waste of time,\" said senior Hamas official Osama Hamdan.\n\nNetanyahu, though, contends that there is no way to end the war until Hamas is completely defeated by Israeli forces.\n\n\"Every day they (the IDF) eliminate dozens of terrorists,\" Netanyahu stated. \"It is a difficult struggle that is waged above ground, sometimes in face-to-face battles, and it is also waged underground.\"\n\n***Please sign up for CBN Newsletters and download the CBN News app to ensure you keep receiving the latest news from a distinctly Christian perspective.***",

        "body": "Evangelist Nick Hall is in the midst of yet another monumental, year-long evangelism campaign \u2014 and he believes hearts and souls are being transformed.\n\n\u201cAnthem of Grace\u201d kicked off with a massive global broadcast on Good Friday, hitting tens of millions of people with the Gospel. Translated into 60 languages, millions more are still consuming the content in nations across the world months after the event was first aired.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s been amazing to see what God is doing,\u201d Hall, founder of the Pulse Movement, told CBN News. \u201cAnd I think we all know this, but \u2026 there\u2019s a revival spreading. There\u2019s joy, there\u2019s hope.\u201d\n\nThe evangelist said the Anthem of Grace campaign centers, in part, on \u201cAmazing Grace,\u201d the \u201cmost sung and most translated hymn ever.\u201d Beyond that, he said the campaign seeks to focus on the power of the Gospel to change hearts and minds.\n\n\u201c[It also focuses on the] story of every believer whose life has been changed by this and trying to tell the story of God\u2019s grace in our lives, and welcoming people into that anthem of grace,\u201d Hall said.\n\nThe faith leader said the mission of highlighting the change God has made in people\u2019s lives and helping others discover the same transformation in their own journeys is the pinnacle of the campaign.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s just incredible to see the hunger, and we\u2019re really just trying to see a global movement of just pointing back to the grace of God,\u201d Hall said. \u201cAnd, hopefully, equipping as many believers as possible to share that story of how God\u2019s changed them.\u201d\n\nHall said he is humbled to see how God has used his ministry to reach so many hearts.\n\nListen to the latest episode of \u201cQuick Start\u201d\n\n\u201cThis is amazing. \u2026 I\u2019ve got three kids, I\u2019m in a ministry now 20 plus years,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd I\u2019m just incredibly humbled and incredibly thankful to still be following Jesus. I\u2019m thankful to be more in love with Jesus than I\u2019ve ever been.\u201d\n\nAt the end of the year, Hall said he hopes \u201cAnthem of Grace\u201d helps light a fire in the hearts of people who have not yet encountered the Lord.\n\n\u201cIn my heart and talking to so many believers \u2026 I just believe Jesus is coming soon \u2026 I just go to, you know, \u2018How do we see as many people as possible hear the Gospel and know the Gospel?'\u201d\n\nHall continued, \u201cBecause we know that \u2026 the Word promises things, right? The Word\u2019s going to go to the ends of the Earth and then Christ is going to return.\u201d\n\nThe preacher offered a reminder of what the Bible says about the end of days, noting how Jesus proclaims there will be \u201cwars, and rumors and wars\u201d and other happenings. Every generation since Christ has awaited His return, but Hall said world conditions right now make it feel more impending.\n\n\u201cIt does seem like there\u2019s a quickening around the world,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd I think what we\u2019re seeing is that the dark is getting darker and the evil is getting greater. And, with that, the light is seeing brighter.\u201d\n\nHall wants every person who claims to know Jesus to \u201ctestify to the goodness of God\u201d \u2014 something he believes would immediately transform global circumstances.\n\n\u201cIt would change the world overnight \u2026 just the testimony of the saints,\u201d Hall said. \u201cEven in Revelation, it says, \u2018We\u2019re going to overcome by the blood of the lamb and the word of their testimony.'\u201d\n\nThus, he hopes people\u2019s testimonies make a massive difference by proving the Gospel\u2019s power and sway to a watching world.",

        "body": "Five converts to Christianity have been sentenced by the Iranian judiciary to a collective of more than 25 years in prison, according to a report from Iran International.\n\nHengaw, an organization reporting on human rights violations against Kurds in Iran, stated there has been no reason given for the charges against the five Christians.\n\nListen to the latest episode of \u201cQuick Start\u201d\n\nHamid Afzali was sentenced to 10 years behind bars, followed by Nasrollah Mousavi, Bijan Gholizadeh, and Iman Salehi, each of whom were sentenced to five years, and Zohrab Shahbazi, who received a nine-month jail sentence, The Jerusalem Post reported.\n\nIn a statement to CBN News, Todd Nettleton, vice president of message for the Voice of the Martyrs, said, \u201cThe growth of the church in Iran is wonderful news for Christians around the world, and a great reminder of God\u2019s ability to grow His church in spite of anything that any government might do to stop it.\u201d\n\n\u201cBut the high price our Iranian brothers and sisters are paying to follow Christ is a different kind of reminder: to pray often for them as they willingly suffer for the name of Christ,\u201d he added.\n\nThe report from Hengaw noted that, while Christians are \u201cacknowledged as a religious minority in Iran, authorities impose severe penalties, especially on those who convert from Islam to Christianity.\u201d\n\nIran\u2019s decision to imprison the five Christian converts violates article 18 of the United Nations\u2019 International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, which states, \u201cEveryone shall have the right to freedom of thought, conscience and religion. This right shall include freedom to have or to adopt a religion or belief of his choice, and freedom, either individually or in community with others and in public or private, to manifest his religion or belief in worship, observance, practice, and teaching.\u201d\n\nIn addition to these five Christian arrests, Hengaw noted that another recent Christian convert in Iran, Yasin Mousavi, has been sentenced to 15 years in prison for charges including \u201cmembership in groups or associations aimed at disrupting security\u201d and \u201cpropaganda against the government through promoting Christianity.\u201d\n\nOpenDoors.org, which tracks Christian persecution around the globe, has placed Iran at No. 9 on its World Watch List and rates the persecution Christians face in the Muslim-ruled country as \u201cextreme.\u201d\n\n\u201cFor Christians who convert from Islam, not even the veneer of tolerance is present. Conversion from Islam to Christianity is illegal in Iran, and anyone caught as a convert can be arrested and imprisoned,\u201d the organization explained in part. \u201cThe government views conversion as an attempt by the West to undermine Islam and the Islamic government of Iran. This means that anyone who is discovered to be a member of a house church can be charged with a crime against national security, which can lead to long prison sentences.\u201d\n\nPlease be in prayer for our brothers and sisters in Christ facing persecution in Iran.",

        "body": "HYDERABAD, India \u2013 Calvary Temple is India's largest church with more than 300,000 members. Now, it's on a mission to build 40 more megachurches in the next 10 years.\n\nMost roads in Hyderabad on Sundays lead to Calvary Temple. Shortly after 4 a.m., side streets around the church here are already jammed.\n\nAs church volunteers coordinate traffic, shuttle buses, auto rickshaws, and motorcycles ferry thousands of people, all trying to get here two hours ahead of Calvary's first of five services that begin at 6 a.m.\n\nBy sunrise, the faithful have taken their seats.\n\nThe main sanctuary holds 18,000 people supported by adjacent Bethlehem Hall with 15,000 and a third structure accommodating more than 3,000 more.\n\nHundreds more watch on television screens scattered around the sprawling Calvary campus.\n\nPastor Satish Kumar preaches all five services with the last one ending at 8 p.m.\n\n\"I've been given the grace to pastor this church which is beyond my dream and imagination,\" Pastor Kumar told CBN News.\n\nCalvary Temple started in 2005 with about two dozen people. Today, it boasts more than 300,000 members making it one of the largest churches in the world.\n\nThey have 11 satellite churches with plans for more nationwide expansion.\n\n\"God put a burden in my heart to establish 40 mega churches just like what you see here during the next 10 years,\" said Kumar.\n\nPastor Kumar says the church adds some 3,000 new believers each month in a sign that the Lord is moving mightily across the country.\n\n\"God's hand is upon India, it's a time for India to reach the lost, not only within the country but across the globe,\" Kumar said.\n\nIn addition, the church produces over 650 TV programs each month in 17 of the country's major languages for broadcast on national television.\n\n\"It's not only within the nation, but also in Bangladesh, Nepal, Sri Lanka, Afghanistan, Pakistan and Gulf countries,\" said Kumar.\n\nMillions more follow on social media. The reason for the church's success?\n\n\"Preaching the pure Word of God is what attracts people, and practicing the Word of God is what keeps people within the church,\" said Kumar.\n\n**Please sign up for CBN Newsletters and download the CBN News app to ensure you keep receiving the latest news from a distinctly Christian perspective.**\n\nThat practical demonstration is on full display here each Sunday.\n\nNarayana Podhili works as a civil engineer during the week. On Sunday, he leads an army of 150 church volunteers who spend hours chopping, slicing, peeling, and stirring \u2013 all to prepare free breakfast, lunch, and dinner meals for 50,000 people.\n\n\"We are committed to come here every Sunday at 3:30 a.m., 4 a.m., and we keep working till evening,\" Podhili told CBN News as he marshaled his forces.\n\nNagavalli Mendem has served in the Calvary kitchen for seven years after making a promise to God that if He healed her cancerous tumor, she would serve the church in this capacity.\n\n\"Because I made that promise, God healed me completely without surgery,\" Mendem said. \"God cleared the tumor in my chest and healed me. As a thanksgiving to Him, I serve here at the Lord's house.\"\n\nShe and volunteers feed more than 200,000 people each month.\n\n\"In India, we say, 'service to mankind is service to God' so that is what we try to practice,\" Kumar said. \"We try to show God's love in action in every possible way that we find.\"\n\nCalvary also has an on-campus hospital where members get free medical treatment on Sundays and medicines at reduced cost.\n\n\"The majority of the people who come here are poor and cannot afford treatment,\" said Dr. Vinod Kumar of Calvary Hospital.\n\nMembers also have access to church facilities to hold marriages. And when a church member passes away, Calvary handles all funeral, burial, and meal arrangements \u2013 again, all for free.\n\nIn 2007, Calvary Temple created an access card system, the first of its kind, to follow up with members and their families.\n\n\"I have thousands of people. How do I know who hasn't shown up on a Sunday? As I was praying God put access card into my mind,\" Kumar said.\n\nEach member must swipe their card when attending any one of the five Sunday services.\n\n\"Without fail, if we don't show up to church, we get a call,\" said Chandraiah, a Calvary Temple member. \"They'll ask me why I didn't come to church and after they find out they will pray for me. I'm happy when I receive that call. Not only that, but the fact also that they care for us is special, and because of that we will surely come to the next service.\"\n\nPastor Kumar says prayer has always been an integral part of their success. The church has held 40 days of prayer and fasting regularly since 2005 drawing tens of thousands of young participants to stadiums around the country.\n\n\"During this 40 days of fasting and prayer, I teach from Genesis to Revelation,\" Kumar told CBN News. \"Every book I try to explain. Hundreds of thousands of young kids end up reading the whole Bible.\"\n\nEach month, the church, along with its satellite campuses, holds a \"Night with God\" as members pray for revival.\n\n\"About 25,000 to 30,000 people join. That has been the biggest, largest all-night prayer services in our nation,\" Kumar said.\n\nIn recent years, however, India has witnessed an unprecedented uptick in violence against Christians.\n\n\"The more the persecution, the more the church grows and that's what's happening in India,\" Kumar said.\n\nMost attacks are carried out by Hindu extremist groups who accuse Christians of forcibly converting people to Christianity.\n\nPastor Kumar, a Hindu convert to Christianity himself, says resistance produces power.\n\n\"No persecution has ever succeeded in stopping the preaching of the Word of God, it always promoted the Word of God and spread the Word of God across the countries,\" said Kumar. \"It's my passion, my burden that before I die, I want to see every Indian will hear the gospel and know the Savior.\"\n\n**Please sign up for CBN Newsletters and download the CBN News app to ensure you keep receiving the latest news from a distinctly Christian perspective.***",

        "body": "Comedian and famed political commentator Bill Maher predicted recently it\u2019s \u201cvery likely\u201d former President Donald Trump will win the November election.\n\nHe went on to condemn the modern political left as \u201caggressively anti-common sense\u201d during an interview with English journalist Tina Brown at the Aspen Ideas Festival in Colorado.\n\n\u201cPart of it the left has to own,\u201d he told Brown. \u201cThey are aggressively anti-common sense. The Democrats keep running on this one idea, saying to the American people, \u2018You can\u2019t possibly think you can do worse than Donald Trump.\u2019 And they keep saying, \u2018Yes, we can. Yes, we can.'\u201d\n\nMaher went on to explain he has Democratic friends who have leftist children, many of whom, the comedian suggested, accuse their parents of \u201cold thinking\u201d and not understanding their progressive points of view.\n\n\u201cTear down statues of Lincoln?

If you\u2019re for Hamas, just live in Gaza for a day \u2026 [even] before the war.\u201d\n\nUltimately, he said the best way to stop Israel from retaliating is to \u201cstop attacking Israel.\u201d\n\n***As the number of voices facing big-tech censorship continues to grow, please sign up for Faithwire\u2019s daily newsletter and download the CBN News app, to stay up-to-date with the latest news from a distinctly Christian perspective.***",

        "body": "The Supreme Court issued two separate rulings on Friday that take direct aim at the power of the federal government.\n\nIn what's widely known as the Chevron case, the court took a step to curb the ability of the ballooning federal bureaucracy to bypass Congress with backdoor regulations.\n\nIn the other case, the high court issued a ruling about obstruction that could have a big impact on the future of President Trump and Capitol riot defendants.\n\nThe Chevron Case & the 'Deep State'\n\n\n\nIn a far-reaching decision, the Supreme Court upended the 40-year-old Chevron precedent that made it easier for federal government agencies to create their own rules on issues like the environment, public health, and business regulations.\n\nThe original Chevron decision allowed federal agencies to unilaterally fill in the details whenever government officials claimed the laws passed by Congress were too ambiguous.\n\nCritics have argued for decades that only Congress has been given the power to legislate, so allowing bureaucrats broad power to invent thousands of regulations violates the U.S. Constitution. It's one of the reasons those critics have referred to the massive size of the federal government as the \"nanny state\" or even the \"deep state\" because unelected bureaucrats often seized that opportunity to operate autonomously from the legislative or judicial branches.\n\nTHE CHEVRON CASE David v Goliath: Small Businesses Fight Federal Bureaucracy at US Supreme Court\n\nBREAKING: In a major blow to the unelected administrative state, the Supreme Court has overruled the Chevron doctrine, which required courts to defer to the legal interpretations of unelected bureaucrats.\n\n\n\n\u201cChevron is overruled.\u201d pic.twitter.com/tqC5EYaUBl \u2014 Sean Davis (@seanmdav) June 28, 2024\n\nChief Justice John Roberts wrote the court's opinion stating, \"Perhaps most fundamentally, Chevron's presumption is misguided because agencies have no special competence in resolving statutory ambiguities. Courts do.\"\n\nTyler O'Neil, managing editor of the Daily Signal, wrote on X, \"This is a huge step forward for holding the administrative state\u2014and the deep state\u2014accountable.\"\n\nThe Capitol Riot and Obstruction\n\nIn the other major case, the Supreme Court made it harder to charge Capitol riot defendants with obstruction, a charge that also has been brought against former President Donald Trump.\n\nIn a 6-3 ruling, the court ruled that charging someone with obstructing an official proceeding must include proof that defendants tried to tamper with or destroy documents. Only some of the people who breached the Capitol on Jan. 6, 2021, fall into that category, so many of those cases are expected to be affected by reduced sentencing.\n\nLiberty Counsel Founder and Chairman Mat Staver said, \"This new narrow interpretation will make it difficult for these indictments to stand.\"\n\nChief Justice John Roberts wrote Friday's decision, joined by Justices Samuel Alito, Neil Gorsuch, Brett Kavanaugh, and Clarence Thomas, and by Biden nominee Justice Ketanji Brown Jackson.\n\nIt's unclear how the court's decision might affect the obstruction case by Special Counsel Jack Smith against Trump in Washington. But the high court is expected to release a separate decision Monday regarding presidential immunity, and that ruling will directly impact Smith's case.\n\n**Please sign up for CBN Newsletters and download the CBN News app to ensure you keep receiving the latest news.**",

        "body": "A last-minute peace deal could still possibly avert a full-on war between Israel and Hezbollah. But the amount of firepower being assembled on Israel's northern border suggests that war could start any day now.\n\nBy the tens of thousands, Israeli troops continue gathering and preparing on that border with Lebanon. Their purpose is to stop Hezbollah terrorists who've been attacking northern Israel from Lebanon almost daily for months.\n\nThat's forced some 80,000 Israelis to flee their homes and empty out whole communities near the border. As Kiryat Shmona resident Yarden Haziza puts it, \"Living right now in Kiryat Shmona is very sad. The city is empty most of the time.\"\n\nHezbollah hit the north with some 40 rockets on just Thursday alone. The terrorists say it was to avenge a number of recent Israeli air strikes on Hezbollah infrastructure and personnel.\n\n'On the March to Conquer the Middle East'\n\nAs the war against Hamas grinds on in Gaza and tensions mount in the north, Israel's prime minister keeps trying to get the world to focus on the threat from Iran, the massive power behind both Hezbollah and Hamas. Benjamin Netanyahu insists Iran's jihadists have an evil goal.\n\nHe's warning Iran and its proxies are, as he put it, \"On the march to conquer the Middle East.\"\n\nVisiting the north this week, Israel's president complained the international community is doing little to stave off war. So Isaac Herzog said it shouldn't be surprised if, as he said, \"The situation spirals out of control.\"\n\nExuberant Defiance of Terrorism\n\nEven as Israel braces for what could be another massive and painful war, the Tribe of Nova came together in Tel Aviv Thursday in exuberant defiance of terrorism. They held their first mass concert since Hamas attacked their festival near Gaza on October 7th.\n\nNimrod Arnin's sister was among the more than 360 festival-goers killed there.\n\nHe told the concert crowd, \u201cOn that Saturday at the beginning of October, our light was put to the test - a test which in our worst nightmares we didn\u2019t imagine we would have to pass. The ultimate darkness challenged the big light of the Tribe of Nova.\"\n\nThe Thursday concert featured dozens of dancers on stage re-enacting the horror of that morning. And the crowd of tens of thousands all stood quiet in a long moment of silence commemorating all who were lost.\n\n'We Will Dance Again!'\n\nBut the main message of the day wasn't at all somber. It was that Israelis will not let the terrorists steal away their lust for life, or their joy, or their dance.\n\nAs concert attendee Maxim Mileyev put it, \"Nothing can stop us from living our lives here in Israel. And nothing can stop us from keeping on dancing and living.\u201d\n\nNimrod Arnin summed up what so many in the Tribe of Nova have come to know. He told the concert crowd, \"In a moment of enlightenment we realized what is going to be the essence of our life from now and on. We will dance again!\"\n\nThe crowd cheered him...and danced for hours. They wanted to show that while Hamas worships death, Israelis embrace life...and life to the fullest.\n\n***Please sign up for CBN Newsletters and download the CBN News app to ensure you keep receiving the latest news from a distinctly Christian perspective.***",

        "title": "UK general election 2024: everything you need to know",
        "body": "Print this page\n\nThe UK general election is days away and, as the nation prepares to vote, pollsters are predicting a landslide victory for the Labour party. Prime Minister Rishi Sunak, whose campaign has been plagued by mishaps, has urged voters to support the Conservatives to avoid a sweeping Labour majority, while Reform UK, Green and Liberal Democrat leaders are seeking to win over voters disillusioned with the two main parties.\n\nHere is a guide to the people and pledges that will shape the vote on Thursday.\n\nLabour party\n\nSince becoming Labour leader in 2020, Sir Keir Starmer has worked to convince business leaders and voters that his party can be trusted with the nation\u2019s purse strings. It has pledged to boost economic growth and ruled out increasing the rate of several taxes, but a lack of concrete revenue-raising proposals has led to accusations that the Labour manifesto is based on \u201cvibes\u201d.\n\nStarmer has stated that wealth creation is Labour\u2019s \u201cnumber one priority\u201d. However, fiscal experts have warned that any party that wins the election will need to raise taxes or cut spending significantly as the UK grapples with poor public finances.\n\nOverview IN NUMBERS 206 Seats in parliament before dissolution 326 Total seats needed to form a majority What\u2019s at stake: If Labour wins the July 4 general election, as polls predict, the challenge for the party will be to deliver on its promises of economic stability and improved public services.\n\nLabour\u2019s key policies\n\nConservatives\n\nThe Conservatives\u2019 14 years in power have been marked by turmoil and a series of stark contrasts. Rising employment levels and the pensions \u201ctriple lock\u201d sit alongside a decline in real wages, a deterioration of public services, and the costs and complications of Brexit. Since the 2016 referendum, the party has struggled to contain infighting, having produced five prime ministers in nine years. Prime Minister Rishi Sunak\u2019s promise to cut inflation has been kept, but pledges to reduce NHS waiting lists and \u201cstop the boats\u201d that bring in migrants have failed.\n\nOverview IN NUMBERS 345 Seats in parliament before dissolution 65 MPs not standing for re-election What\u2019s at stake: The Conservatives\u2019 biggest challenge this election is regaining the trust of ordinary voters to avoid an electoral wipeout. Several Tory \u201csafe seats\u201d are predicted to turn red or yellow as the nation grapples with a cost of living crisis, the longest NHS waiting list in memory and an economy described as the \u201csick man of Europe\u201d.\n\nKey policies\n\nLiberal Democrats\n\nTraditionally the UK\u2019s third major party, the Liberal Democrats have not been in power for more than a century, except as a coalition partner with the Tories from 2010 to 2015. Leader Sir Ed Davey\u2019s manifesto pledge to secure a favourable trade deal with the EU has set the party apart in a political landscape largely devoid of any debate on Brexit. Earlier this year, Davey told the FT that the party expected to win votes from \u201cTheresa May Conservative[s]\u201d in Tory strongholds.\n\nOverview IN NUMBERS 15 Seats in parliament before dissolution What\u2019s at stake: Ahead of the election, the Lib Dems \u201chave a simple task \u2014 tell voters that they exist, persuade those voters that the Lib Dems should win, that the Conservatives can be beaten, and equally importantly that Labour cannot beat them\u201d.\n\nReform UK\n\nFounded by Nigel Farage as the Brexit party, the since-rebranded Reform UK aims to tap into discontent with the major parties over issues including immigration. The party chose not to stand against the Conservatives in 2019, but is now fielding candidates in almost every seat. Described by its leadership as an \u201centrepreneurial political start-up\u201d, Reform has been a growing force in the election, overtaking the Tories in some polls.\n\nThough not expected to win many constituencies, Reform is likely to take support from the Tories that may cost the incumbent party a significant number of seats.\n\nOverview IN NUMBERS 1 Seat in parliament before dissolution What\u2019s at stake: A strong Reform turnout is likely to be detrimental to Conservative hopes, but the party's future beyond being a rightwing protest vote remains unclear.\n\nSNP\n\nThe current largest party in Scotland, the Scottish National party dominates areas that were traditionally held by Labour. However, the party has struggled to raise campaign funds following a police investigation into alleged embezzlement of SNP coffers and the forced resignation of two leaders in as many years.\n\nOverview IN NUMBERS 43 Seats in parliament before dissolution What\u2019s at stake: The SNP faces the challenge of repelling Labour in its traditional heartlands. The party is forecast to win 21 seats in Scotland, down from 48 in 2019. Independence, rejected by the Scottish people in a 2014 referendum, remains a long-term goal.\n\nGreen party\n\nThe Green party has moved beyond its traditional environmental focus to position itself as the pre-eminent leftwing Labour alternative, in the hopes of stealing voters disillusioned by Starmer\u2019s policies on Gaza, taxation and public investment.\n\nOverview IN NUMBERS 1 Seat in parliament before dissolution What\u2019s at stake: The Green party\u2019s primary goal in the July 4 election is to increase its representation in parliament and influence policy on environmental issues as public concern over climate change grows.\n\nPlaid Cymru\n\nPlaid Cymru\u2019s campaign has focused on advocating for the interests of Wales in Westminster. The party has emphasised the need for greater investment in the Welsh economy and healthcare system and has pledged \u00a34bn in funds from HS2 to improve public transport in the country.",

        "body": "In May, the parent companies of two leading British tea brands reported record sales: Kallo Foods, which owns Clipper Teas, jumped 8% to \u00a3121.7 million ($155.5 million) in 2023, while Bettys and Taylors, which owns domestic market leader Yorkshire Tea, grew turnover 14% to \u00a3295.7 million ($375.5 million).\n\nShortly afterwards, Twinings\u2014another top brand, owned by Associated British Foods\u2014reported its highest ever after-tax earnings of \u00a377 million ($97.8 million).\n\nSo far, you might say, so unsurprising. Everyone knows the Brits love their tea, which George Orwell once described as \u201cone the mainstays of civilization\u201d in the country.\n\nGeorge Orwell once described tea as \u201cone the mainstays of civilization\u201d in the country. ullstein bild/Getty Images\n\nBut take a closer look, and you\u2019ll see this isn\u2019t quite service as usual.\n\nTea is indeed popular\u2014the U.K. quaffs about 36 billion cups in a year, with half the population partaking daily\u2014but consumption has fallen precipitously, particularly for black tea, volumes of which have been dropping 2-3% annually for decades, as the bitter aroma of barista-style coffee wafts increasingly though Britain\u2019s high streets.\n\nSo does the recent spate of bumper sales mean the time for tea has come again?\n\nThe coffee shop conundrum\n\nIf \u2018builder\u2019s tea\u2019\u2014black, dispensed in tea bags, usually served with milk, often with sugar\u2014is making a comeback, it\u2019s not showing in the data.\n\nAccording to Kiti Soininen, Category Director, UK Food & Drink Research at market research firm Mintel, \u201cthe ordinary tea bag segment has resumed its long-term volume decline\u201d after a brief hiatus during the pandemic.\n\nA box of Yorkshire Tea. John Keeble\u2014Getty Images\n\nThis shouldn\u2019t be a surprise, if you consider where the market started.\n\n\u201cIf you go back to the 1970s, pretty much the only hot drink we had was tea. We had the odd instant coffee, but we were a tea-drinking nation,\u201d says Ben Newbury, head of brand marketing for Yorkshire Tea at Betty\u2019s and Taylor\u2019s. As the variety and quality of alternative beverages increased, led by but not limited to coffee, the only way was down.\n\nBut Newbury believes that this inevitable incumbency effect has been compounded by a sense of apathy and defeatism in the sector. \u201cA lot of other manufacturers and brands just stopped talking about tea and its benefits,\u201d he says.\n\nYorkshire Tea is certainly unusual in having enjoyed recent growth in both value (revenue) and volume (the number of tea bags sold) terms of 21% and 12%, respectively, in 2023.\n\nIt did this by growing market share in black tea, which Newbury attributes to its premium positioning within the mass market. In a cost of living crisis, it turns out, Brits found cutting back on \u00a35 ($6.35) skinny lattes more palatable than skimping a few pennies on a tea bag.\n\nMost others reporting strong results did so despite dwindling volumes, with sales growing directly on higher prices due to cost inflation.\n\nYorkshire isn\u2019t the only brand to have realized the advantages of being premium, says Soininen, pointing to Tata-owned Tetley launching its Golden Brew, and Lipton\u2014the world\u2019s largest tea company, spun out from Unilever in 2022 with over 30 brands\u2014relaunching its mass market U.K. brand PG Tips last year with a higher emphasis on quality.\n\n\u201cTea has been a bit unloved in the U.K., because of a lack of category leadership,\u201d says Gareth Mead, Lipton\u2019s chief corporate communications and sustainability officer. He points out that PG Tips\u2019 new advertising campaign\u2014featuring British rapper and actor Ashley Walters, and directed by Sir Steve McQueen, of 12 Years A Slave fame\u2014was its first new campaign in nearly eight years.\n\n\u201cIf you want consumers to drink more tea, let\u2019s give a reason to buy the product\u2026 our approach has been to reinvest in PG Tips,\u201d says Mead, who adds that first quarter volumes rose for the first time in years. \u201cThere is a huge opportunity to revitalize Britain\u2019s love for tea.\u201d\n\nGiven the long-term decline in everyday tea drinking, that\u2019s a bold statement. But Lipton, like Yorkshire and the wider industry, sees potential for new markets in perhaps surprising places.\n\nTea time for Gen Z\n\nLondon\u2019s never had a caf\u00e9 culture, not in the manner of Paris or Vienna. Traditional silver service tea rooms have long since given way to cookie-cutter coffee shops on the city\u2019s streets, surviving only as afternoon tea, which typically takes place out of sight in plush hotels.\n\nBubble tea is now estimated to be a $2.6 billion global market, growing at over 7% annually. Getty Images\n\nBut over the last decade, a Taiwanese import has brought public tea culture back to life\u2014though it\u2019s doubtful Orwell would have recognized it as such.\n\nIf you stroll along Shaftesbury Avenue in London\u2019s West End, from Piccadilly Circus to New Oxford Street, you\u2019ll pass by my count at least 10 bubble tea stores, selling cold tea shaken over ice in plastic cups, often startlingly colored, with assorted jellies, popping bobas and tapioca pearls. Popular flavors include lychee, taro and winter melon; Darjeeling and Lady Grey, not so much.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s fascinating, the younger generation coming into tea. It feels very similar to coffee shop culture. It\u2019s really about theater and a personalized treat, similar to having a frappe or flavored coffee,\u201d says Ben Newbury. Westend61\u2014Getty Images\n\nThe clientele, often queuing outside onto Soho backstreets, is overwhelmingly in their teens and 20s, and they can\u2019t get enough of it.\n\nNewbury is under no illusions that younger Britons will ever adopt the tea habits of their parents or grandparents\u2014a YouGov poll found a quarter of over 60s drink more than 20 cups a week, compared with only 6% of 16-24 year olds\u2014but he does see bubble tea as emblematic of the way Gen Z can be drawn into new tea drinking experiences.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s fascinating, the younger generation coming into tea. It feels very similar to coffee shop culture. It\u2019s really about theater and a personalized treat, similar to having a frappe or flavored coffee,\u201d he says.\n\nNeither Yorkshire nor Lipton engage directly with bubble, or boba, tea\u2014now estimated to be a $2.6 billion global market, growing at over 7% annually\u2014but both have embraced ways of drinking tea that would have been unimaginable only a few decades ago.\n\nMead points to Lipton Cold Infuse (tea designed to be brewed cold as opposed to iced tea: Lipton Ice Tea is an entirely separate entity, remaining a joint venture between Unilever and Pepsico) and the tea concentrates of its Tazo brand, which have seen particular growth in France and the United States respectively.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s been an image problem. If you try googling Gen Z and tea, you\u2019ll struggle. You\u2019ll see relatively old people looking wistfully into the distance. It\u2019s a personal moment of pleasure, which is great, but very different from the hard-hitting, front-of-mind energy of coffee,\u201d Mead explains.\n\nBeyond variety, vibe and novelty, he adds, the opportunity for tea among Gen Z comes from its alignment with two megatrends: health (tea has many proven health benefits, including high levels of polyphenol and flavonoids, which benefit the heart) and sustainability (tea involves very little processing and is very light, so has a relatively small environmental footprint).\n\n\u201cGen Z aren\u2019t regular tea drinkers yet, but they care about those things more than any other generation,\u201d he says. \u201cIt\u2019s something we should be very excited about as an industry. It\u2019s our job as the world\u2019s largest tea company to help people rediscover tea, in whatever form suits their needs. There\u2019s no reason it can\u2019t be cooler than coffee.\u201d\n\nDiversification and internationalization\n\nTeas marketed for their health benefits have been the standout performers in the category in recent years, according to Mintel\u2019s Soininen, with 19% of new launches in the U.K. having some kind of \u2018functional\u2019 claim, many related to reducing stress or improving sleep.\n\n\u201cTea is the ultimate elixir. It can get you out of bed. It can be there to have a conversation over. Or for some people it\u2019s what they have before they go to sleep.\u201d Ben Newbury\n\nLipton\u2019s Pukka brand, which specializes in herbal teas, has spread from the U.K. around the world, while Yorkshire has recently launched a herb-infused decaf, and even a Yorkshire Tea Kombucha.\n\nBeyond reaching Gen Z, it\u2019s part of a wider trend towards product diversification, as businesses develop tea products or brands to meet divergent niches\u2014whether for different groups, needs or even times of day.\n\n\u201cTea is the ultimate elixir. It can get you out of bed. It can be there to have a conversation over. Or for some people it\u2019s what they have before they go to sleep,\u201d says Newbury.\n\nReflecting this need to hit multiple bases, Yorkshire is part of a group that includes premium specialty tea business Taylors of Harrogate, as well as Taylor\u2019s coffee and Betty\u2019s tea rooms. Lipton\u2019s portfolio, on the other hand, includes its eponymous brand (the bestseller in 150 countries) as well as PG Tips, Pukka, Tazo\u2019s fruity and spicy teas, and T2\u2019s blend of premium tea with fine tea-ware, aimed at the luxury gifting market.\n\nAnother strategy is to diversify outside of Britain. After all, unlike in the U.K. the global at-home tea market\u2014worth $127 billion in 2024, according to Statista\u2014is growing, at a compound annual growth rate of 6%.\n\nLipton did this long ago. Now based in the Netherlands, its Glasgow-founded flagship brand is no longer for sale in the U.K. But family-owned Yorkshire is also actively targeting sales in growth markets abroad. \u201cThey\u2019re making lattes with Yorkshire Gold in some parts of China,\u201d Newbury remarks.\n\nBritish tea culture still has a cachet around the world, and still means something at home. Will it be what it was, the daytime drink, and a mainstay of a civilization? Unlikely. Orwell\u2019s time has passed, for better or worse.\n\nBut can it survive and start to grow again? Yes. Like anything else, it is evolving, and it is the businesses that recognize this and evolve with it that will ultimately succeed.",
        "summary": "A box of Yorkshire Tea.\nYorkshire Tea is certainly unusual in having enjoyed recent growth in both value (revenue) and volume (the number of tea bags sold) terms of 21% and 12%, respectively, in 2023.\nIt did this by growing market share in black tea, which Newbury attributes to its premium positioning within the mass market.\nIf you try googling Gen Z and tea, you\u2019ll struggle.\n\u201cGen Z aren\u2019t regular tea drinkers yet, but they care about those things more than any other generation,\u201d he says.",

        "body": "Japan issued newly designed banknotes for the first time since 2004 in a move that may provide a small boost to the economy while potentially nudging some cash hoarders to invest money instead of stashing it under the mattress.\n\nThe Bank of Japan shipped the first bundle of newly designed notes on Wednesday. The new \u00a510,000 bills ($62) feature a portrait of Eiichi Shibusawa, seen as the father of Japanese capitalism.\n\nWhile the move aimed at keeping counterfeiters and tax dodgers on the back foot appears at odds with the growing popularity of cash-free transactions by consumers and businesses, central bank and finance ministry officials continue to flag the enduring importance of paper money.\n\n\u201cDespite the trend toward cashless payment, cash is a secure means of payment that can be used by anyone, anywhere, and at any time, and it will continue to play a significant role,\u201d Bank of Japan Governor Kazuo Ueda said Wednesday morning, echoing comments by Finance Minister Shunichi Suzuki the previous day.\n\nPrime Minister Fumio Kishida reiterated that point and the improved security of the new notes at a press conference Wednesday to commemorate the launch of the new banknotes.\n\n\u201cI hope they will be liked by Japanese people while adding a spark to the economy,\u201d Kishida said at the BOJ.\n\nAfter a slow start, cashless transactions accounted for 39% of all transactions in Japan in 2023, steadily increasing over the past decade, according to the economy ministry. That means Japan is catching up with other countries\u2019 adoption of cash-free payments, though it still lags behind South Korea and China, where more than 80% of payments were already conducted cashlessly in 2020, according to the ministry.\n\nThe introduction of the banknotes is expected to have an impact of more than \u00a51.5 trillion on the nation\u2019s economy, pushing up gross domestic product by around a quarter percentage point, according to Takahide Kiuchi, executive economist at Nomura Research Institute and an ex-Bank of Japan board member.\n\nThe boost stems from the investment needed to update various systems from ticket dispensers to automated teller machines. At the same time, the updating of the equipment will also put a strain on some small businesses given the lack of government subsidies to help them.\n\nSuzuki said that nearly 80-90% of electronic cash registers and station ticketing machines are expected to be compatible with the new bills from the get-go, while only about 30% of vending machines would be ready.\n\nSome analysts also point to the potential for some savers of cash to change their behavior.\n\nDecades of deflation and rock-bottom interest rates at banks have encouraged Japanese households to keep relatively large amounts of their savings in cash.\n\nFamilies held an estimated \u00a560 trillion in savings in notes as of the end of last year, according to Hideo Kumano, executive economist at Dai-Ichi Life Research Institute.\n\nWhen new notes have been introduced previously, many cash hoarders have opted to replace old notes with new ones. This time around they may be encouraged to start investing the money instead, since the emergence of the strongest inflation in decades means money stuffed under the mattress will simply lose value going forward.\n\n\u201cI think this will spark positive moves such as increased investment, bank deposits or consumer spending,\u201d said Eiji Kinouchi, chief technical analyst at Daiwa Securities. \u201cThe key is whether real interest rates remain low.\u201d",

        "body": "Eli Lilly & Co.\u2019s Alzheimer\u2019s treatment was cleared in the US as the second drug to slow progression of the mind-robbing disease that afflicts 6 million Americans.\n\nIt\u2019s a big win for Lilly and its investors, who have been eagerly anticipating the drug since it showed promise in clinical trials more than three years ago. Called Kisunla, the medicine endured a number of regulatory delays on the road to approval. It will compete with Eisai Co.\u2019s Leqembi, which has been available for sale in the US since early 2023.\n\n\n\nShares of Indianapolis-based Lilly closed down 0.8% Tuesday in New York. The stock had surged more than 50% so far this year before today amid rapid growth of weight-loss and diabetes sales. Shares of Eisai partner Biogen Inc. fell 1.3%\n\n\n\nThe Alzheimer\u2019s drug will cost $32,000 in the first year of treatment, Lilly said. That\u2019s slightly more than the $26,500 annual price for Leqembi for a person of average size. But doctors can stop the treatment if brain plaques \u2014 the toxic material that the drug removes \u2014 fall to minimal levels, which they did in many people in trials after about a year.\n\nLower costs\n\nThat means that the total out-of-pocket treatment cost of the drug could sometimes be less than other amyloid drugs, Lilly said. In Leqembi\u2019s main approval trial, patients were treated for a full 18 months.\n\nThe Eisai and Lilly products are both infusions that remove toxic amyloid from the brains of Alzheimer\u2019s patients. They only modestly slow the disease and are approved only for people with early-stage Alzheimer\u2019s, a minority of the total patient population with the disease. Side effects of both include brain swelling and brain bleeding.\n\nBrain swelling or bleeding occurred in 36% of patients on Lilly\u2019s drug in the company\u2019s main study, and produced symptoms in 6% of them, according to the drug\u2019s label. Regular scans are required to monitor for these effects. Lilly\u2019s drug has a potential convenience advantage since it\u2019s infused every four weeks, compared with every two for Leqembi.\n\nLess frequent dosing and the potential to stop treatment are \u201ca really big deal,\u201d Howard Fillit, co-founder of the Alzheimer\u2019s Drug Discovery Foundation, said in an interview before the approval.\n\nSeries of delays\n\nLilly faced a series of delays bringing Kisunla to the market. In early 2023, the FDA refused to give the drug accelerated approval based on early trial results, telling the company it wanted to wait for a late-stage trial. When Lilly submitted that data, the FDA needed more time to review it. Then earlier this year, the agency decided late in the review process to convene a day-long hearing to review the drug\u2019s safety and efficacy.\n\nA panel of outside advisers to the FDA voted unanimously in favor of the drug on June 10.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s a lot of emotion in the hallways today,\u201d Anne White, president of Lilly Neuroscience, said in an interview before the approval. \u201cWe have portraits up on our walls of family members to remind us why we\u2019re doing what we\u2019re doing.\u201d\n\n\n\nOnce considered integral to Lilly\u2019s future, Alzheimer\u2019s has been overshadowed by the company\u2019s GLP-1 medicines that aid in weight loss, a market expected to reach $130 billion a year by the end of the decade, according to analysts at Goldman Sachs.\n\n\n\nSales of Alzheimer\u2019s drugs are also expected to grow significantly. Bloomberg Intelligence analysts see sales surging to $13 billion by 2030 from about $250 million this year.\n\n\u201cHaving multiple treatment options is the kind of advancement we\u2019ve all been waiting for \u2014 all of us who have been touched, even blindsided, by this difficult and devastating disease,\u201d said Joanne Pike, CEO of the Alzheimer\u2019s Association, in a statement. The nonprofit has pushed hard for approval and broad insurance coverage for amyloid-lowering drugs.\n\n\n\nLeqembi\u2019s rollout by Eisai and partner Biogen Inc. has been slowed by logistical issues, reimbursement uncertainties and complicated safety testing requirements. Medicare, the US health program for the elderly, didn\u2019t routinely cover the treatments until recently, and hospital neurology programs weren\u2019t set up to perform the monitoring required to use the drugs.",

        "title": "Steve Daines holds up Washington Commanders stadium to pressure team to revive former logo called racist",
        "body": "After a half century of activism, many Native Americans thought a bitter debate over the capital\u2019s football mascot was over two years ago when the team became the Washington Commanders.\n\nThe organization left behind the racist slur \u201credskins\u201d as its name and retired the logo that was closely tied to that name: the profile of a Native man with long hair and two feathers.\n\nNow, a white Republican U.S. senator from Montana is reviving the debate by blocking a bill funding the revitalization of the decrepit RFK Stadium for the Commanders, who have been playing miles away in Maryland. Sen. Steve Daines says he will block the legislation until the NFL and the Commanders honor the former logo in some form.\n\nDaines declined Associated Press requests to explain his stance or respond to criticism from Indigenous people who say such efforts are rooted in racism.\n\nLogo\u2019s complicated history\n\nThe original logo was designed by a member of the Blackfeet Nation in the state of Montana. Some tribal members take pride in it and the legacy of the man who helped design it in the early \u201970s \u2014 Walter \u201cBlackie\u201d Wetzel, a former Blackfeet Nation tribal chairman and former president of the National Congress of the American Indian, the country\u2019s oldest Native American and Alaska Native advocacy organization.\n\nWetzel\u2019s family says Daines and Wetzel\u2019s son Don, who died last year at 74, formed a friendship that may be fueling the senator\u2019s fight for the logo.\n\nIndian Country is typically a bipartisan topic in Congress.\n\nDaines sits on the Senate Committee for Indian Affairs and has worked with Democratic colleagues on clean-water access for tribal communities. He has supported the passage of a truth-and-healing commission to investigate the history of Indian boarding schools, a bill carried by Sen. Elizabeth Warren, a Democrat from Massachusetts.\n\nDaines has also used the policy area to take jabs at the Biden administration and was one of the fiercest opponents to the nomination of Deb Haaland, the first Native American to run the Department of the Interior.\n\nHe accused her of being hostile to the energy and natural-resource extraction industries and said she would use the appointment to \u201cnegatively impact the Montana way of life.\u201d In May, he blocked the nomination of the woman who wanted to be the first Native American federal district court judge in Montana. Daines said the Biden administration did not consult with his office about the nomination, a claim the White House disputes.\n\nPainful symbolism?\n\nDaines said in a prepared statement that he would hold up the stadium legislation until representatives of the Washington Commanders and the NFL show that they\u2019re working with the Wetzel family and leaders of the Blackfeet Nation to find a way to \u201chonor the history of the logo and heritage of our tribal nations and to rededicate the organization as an advocate for Indian Country.\u201d\n\nFor many Indigenous peoples, the team\u2019s original name and logo represent an ugly history of racial discrimination and violence, as well as modern-day battles over ethical representation of Native Americans in popular culture. The National Congress of the American Indian, the organization that Walter Wetzel once led, has fought since 1968 to remove mascots like that one. Numerous psychological studies have shown the harmful impacts that Native American mascots have on children.\n\nA divided family\n\nFounded in Boston in 1932, the football team had a Native American man as its mascot, but after moving to Washington D.C. in 1937, the logo was changed to a spear, later an \u201cR\u201d adorned with two feathers.\n\nWalter Wetzel had been working for the Department of Labor to address housing and employment disparities in Indian Country and worked closely with President John F. Kennedy, and was friends with him and Robert Kennedy. Wetzel worked with the football team to redesign its logo. He felt that, if the team was going to have a Native American-themed mascot, it should at least be a representative image, said his grandson Ryan Wetzel.\n\nWalter Wetzel suggested a profile of a former Blackfeet chief, John Two Guns White Calf. A likeness of that image would be used from the 1972 season until it was retired in 2020.\n\n\u201cI understand the controversy of the name, I get it,\u201d Ryan Wetzel said. \u201cI come from a family that is divided with the name. But the logo, how can we still keep that and use that moving forward?\u201d\n\nRyan Wetzel said that in his final years his father Don had an amputated leg but still showed up regularly on Capitol Hill to find support for preserving the logo, and Daines took ahold of that cause. Daines reached out to Ryan Wetzel after his father died last year to see if he could help revive the effort to restore the logo in some way.\n\nA \u201cdog-whistle\u201d?\n\nA spokesperson for Daines said talks with the Washington Commanders on a way to honor the Wetzel family are ongoing and productive. In his statements during a May committee hearing on the RFK stadium bill, Daines suggested that the logo could be revitalized to sell merchandise, and a portion of the profits could go toward issues like the epidemic of missing and murdered Indigenous women.\n\nBut Native American advocates and researchers say use of the old logo is an inappropriate and harmful path to achieving justice and equity for Indigenous peoples. No matter how the image was chosen, it cannot be separated from the racial slur it once promoted, said Crystal Echo Hawk, a member of the Pawnee Nation and the founder and CEO of IllumiNative, a nonprofit that works to increase the visibility of Native Americans. She called the former logo a \u201cdog-whistle\u201d to the team\u2019s former name.\n\n\u201cThe science underscores the detrimental impact these images have on Indigenous peoples,\u201d said Dr. Stephanie Fryberg, a professor of psychology at the University of Michigan and one of the country\u2019s leading experts on the topic.\n\nFryberg, who is a member of the Tulalip Tribe in Washington State, said the use of these mascots leads to heightened rates of depression, self-harm, substance abuse, and suicidal ideation, particularly among children.\n\n\u201cThe continued use of these racist images prevents Native Americans from existing and being honored within contemporary social contexts,\u201d she said.\n\nWhat did the Blackfeet Nation get?\n\nIn Montana, some Blackfeet Nation council members wonder why so little of the millions of dollars the football team generated off the image of White Calf and designed by a former Blackfeet Nation chairman never made it back to the Blackfeet people.\n\nDecades ago, the football team donated a couple of vans to help transport Blackfeet elders to a nearby VA facility, said Blackfeet Nation Councilman Everett Armstrong, but he was unaware of any other resources or revenues that had been shared with the tribe. A spokesperson for the Washington Commanders was unable to provide any other examples but said the team is in talks with the Wetzel family.\n\nThere are strong feelings about the logo and its legacy on the reservation, said Armstrong. But one group feels left out of the discussion entirely: the descendants of White Calf.\n\nThey were not consulted in the 1970\u2019s about the use of his image and have never been asked about it since, said Armstrong, a descendant of White Calf himself.\n\n\u201cThey\u2019d like a seat at the table,\u201d he said.",

        "body": "CEOs\u2019 cups runneth over, largely because they\u2019re serving themselves. And the billionaire CEO of Salesforce, Marc Benioff, is no exception. But it seems as if Benioff\u2019s spree is slowing down ever so slightly, as his shareholders just pumped the brakes on his latest hefty compensation package.\n\nAlongside the suggested pay plans of other Salesforce executives, Benioff\u2019s proposed compensation was rejected by 404.8 million votes (versus 339.3 million in favor), according to a Securities and Exchange Commission filing published on Monday.\n\nLike many bigwigs, Benioff\u2019s real worth comes from his stock options. His base salary stayed at $1.55 million, but he raked in $39.6 million in the 2024 fiscal year. The prior year, Benioff made $29.9 million, and his worth ballooned as Salesforce offered him yet more stock grants, including a $20 million equity opportunity in the plan shareholders just rejected, according to a Salesforce proxy statement.\n\nWhile the board encouraged shareholders to accept said proposal, two shareholder advisory companies, Glass Lewis and Institutional Shareholder Services, suggested otherwise, according to CNBC. The shareholders\u2019 vote, however, is not binding, meaning Benioff could still get his million-dollar bonus.\n\nSalesforce did not immediately respond to Fortune\u2019s request for comment.\n\nBoth executives and shareholders have made out quite nicely in the shadow of the pandemic. Shareholder payouts and CEO pay have \u201crisen to record levels,\u201d according to nonprofit Oxfam\u2019s report analyzing more than 200 of the largest U.S. corporations. CEO pay has jumped by 31% from 2018 to 2022, per said study.\n\n\u201cThe rules are being rigged, and the companies are helping to rig them,\u201d Irit Tamir, senior director of Oxfam America\u2019s private sector department, told Fortune in March, adding that \u201cwe are essentially in a new Gilded Age.\u201d\n\nLook no further than Elon Musk\u2019s recent victory to see how the game is played. Earlier this year, a judge in Delaware ruled that Musk\u2019s proposed pay package for Tesla, worth a record $55 billion, wasn\u2019t justified and called it an \u201cunfathomable sum.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe process leading to the approval of Musk\u2019s compensation plan was deeply flawed,\u201d Chancellor Kathaleen McCormick wrote, adding that the CEO \u201chad extensive ties with the persons tasked with negotiating on Tesla\u2019s behalf.\u201d\n\nEven so, the board pushed back against this decision and asked shareholders again to vote on the package. They overwhelmingly sided with Musk, granting back a pay plan now valued at $44.9 billion, per the Associated Press. That\u2019s even though Musk has been criticized for splitting his attention among too many projects, even being called an \u201cabsent CEO\u201d by Gerber Kawasaki CEO Ross Gerber.\n\nGerber, a shareholder himself, excoriated the Tesla board ahead of its second vote. \u201cNot only is the board not independent, they basically work for Elon,\u201d he told Fox Business. \u201cAt some point, you\u2019ve just got to say, this board needs to be replaced.\u201d\n\nEven so, Musk\u2019s absence appears to be worth billions in the pandemic era of the CEO. The same can\u2019t be said for Benioff as of yet\u2014but that could change.",

        "title": "Steve Ballmer, who was once Bill Gates\u2019 assistant, is now richer than his onetime mentor",
        "body": "When Steve Ballmer joined Microsoft he didn\u2019t get a single company share. But now, his skyrocketing Microsoft holdings have made him richer than the company\u2019s founder.\n\nThe 68-year-old former Microsoft CEO squeaked by his onetime boss Bill Gates to become the sixth richest person in the world on Monday with a net worth of $157 billion. He is now richer than many well-known tech entrepreneurs including Google cofounder Sergey Brin, Oracle founder Larry Ellison, and Dell Technologies CEO Michael Dell.\n\nIt\u2019s also the first time that Ballmer\u2019s net worth has surpassed that of Gates, and one of the few times in history an employee has come to be richer than a company\u2019s founder. Ballmer is the only person with a net worth of $100 billion or more who made their money as an employee rather than a founder, as Fortune previously reported.\n\nBallmer\u2019s net worth was boosted by a rally in Microsoft\u2019s shares, which closed at an all-time high on Tuesday and have surged 22% since January. Shares of the company represent about 90% of his net worth, according to the Bloomberg Billionaires Index, and Microsoft has been one of the biggest beneficiaries of the AI boom fueling markets, thanks to its $10 billion investment in OpenAI.\n\nIn 2014, Ballmer left Microsoft with about a 4% stake worth $22.5 billion, according to Forbes. At the time, he said that he was holding on to his shares for the long term, Forbes reported.\n\n\u201cI\u2019d like to own Microsoft shares until I either give something to charity or I die,\u201d he told the outlet.\n\nMeanwhile, Gates has diversified his portfolio over the years away from the company he founded, with half of his holdings now managed through private investment firm Cascade Investment. He has a $21 billion stake in waste management company Republic Services through Cascade, Bloomberg reported.\n\nGiving away money\n\nGates\u2019 major philanthropic donations also factor in. As of 2023, Gates and his ex-wife Melinda French Gates had donated $59.5 billion to the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation, turning it into the one of the world\u2019s largest charitable foundations. In 2010, Gates also cocreated the Giving Pledge with French Gates and investor Warren Buffett, and has promised to give away most of his wealth during his lifetime.\n\nAlthough Steve Ballmer\u2019s holdings have made him one of the richest men in the world, when he joined as the company\u2019s 30th employee in 1980, he didn\u2019t get a single share. After dropping out of Stanford Business School, he served as a quasi\u2013personal assistant to Bill Gates with the unimpressive title \u201cbusiness manager,\u201d Forbes reported.\n\nYet, because Microsoft was looking to grow rapidly at the time, Gates and his cofounder, Paul Allen, agreed to give Ballmer 10% of the profit growth he generated on top of his $50,000 yearly salary.\n\nThat deal turned out to be key to Ballmer\u2019s future wealth. Soon, Microsoft was growing so fast that Ballmer\u2019s 10% cut no longer made sense financially for the company. When Microsoft reorganized as a corporation, Ballmer negotiated an 8% slice for himself in exchange for giving up his profit-sharing deal, while Gates and Allen kept 84% and another 8% was designated for other employees, Forbes reported. Although Allen was opposed to giving Ballmer such a large stake, Gates stepped in and said Ballmer\u2019s 8% cut could be funded by a drawdown of his own holdings, according to Forbes.\n\nWhile at the time Gates put his own money on the line for Ballmer, the two have since drifted apart.\n\n\u201cMicrosoft was kind of the thing that really bound us,\u201d Ballmer told Bloomberg Television in 2016. \u201cWe started off as friends, but then really got quite enmeshed around Microsoft. Since I\u2019ve gone, we really have drifted a little bit.\u201d",

        "title": "Ovarian cancer and Chris Evert: Why early detection doesn't help",
        "body": "A New York Times story this week about tennis legend Chris Evert\u2019s battle\u2014twice\u2014with ovarian cancer painted a simple and powerful picture: Fearing for her own risk after her sister died of the disease, Evert got tested, caught it early, as stage 1, and treated it successfully in 2022. And though it returned\u2014stage 1 again, meaning it had not spread\u2014she was able to catch that, too, and treat it again. Now the 69-year-old has been declared cancer-free a second time.\n\n\u201cAs with her original diagnosis,\u201d the story notes, \u201cearly testing was critical\u2014a message Ms. Evert shares zealously.\u201d\n\nExcept for just one problem: When it comes to ovarian cancer, there is no such thing as early testing.\n\n\u201cThere is no approved screening. There is no method of early detection,\u201d Sarah DeFeo, chief program officer at the Ovarian Cancer Research Alliance (OCRA), tells Fortune. \u201cIt\u2019s a rare disease,\u201d with a one-in-87 over-lifetime risk, \u201cso it\u2019s not something that happens as part of a well-woman checkup, whether with a gynecologist or regular internal medicine.\u201d\n\nThat\u2019s because, says Dr. Gillian Hanley, a member of OCRA\u2019s scientific advisory committee and an associate professor of obstetrics and gynecology at the University of British Columbia, \u201call of the screening methods that have been tried have failed to decrease mortality rates to date, which is how we determine whether or not a screening method is effective.\u201d\n\nWhile there are some standard ways of surveilling for ovarian cancer if it is suspected\u2014including a CA-125 blood test that could possibly indicate tumor markers and a transvaginal ultrasound that could help identify masses\u2014they are imprecise. Plus, they are not indicated or available to women in the absence of either symptoms\u2014which tend to only reveal themselves once the cancer has progressed significantly\u2014or a high-risk factor, meaning the patient has already tested positive for carrying genetic markers that significantly raise the possibility of getting ovarian cancer.\n\n\u201cIf you\u2019re just a regular, average-risk person walking around in the world, a doctor may be like, \u2018[a routine scan is] not medically indicated. There\u2019s no need for that\u2026 There\u2019s no evidence to suggest that ultrasounds are effective,'\u201d says DeFeo. \u201cSo that\u2019s not something that is recommended. It\u2019s not neutral\u2014 it\u2019s like, \u2018No, don\u2019t do it.\u2019\u201d\n\nInstead, what women should consider, she says, is getting tested for genetic markers. It\u2019s something Evert has talked about previously\u2014having tested positive for the BRCA-1 gene after her sister\u2019s death, then undergoing a preventative hysterectomy with removal of her ovaries and fallopian tubes. It was only then, through the pathology report, that she learned she had stage 1 ovarian cancer (which returned, even after the surgery, due to the fact that microscopic cancer cells can sometimes remain in the abdomen).\n\nNone of those details were mentioned in the most recent New York Times article\u2014but they are actually the most vital, says DeFeo.\n\n\u201cShe has talked a lot about getting tested early, but to me, the real story is about the importance of knowing your risk and about risk management,\u201d she says. \u201cI think that that\u2019s the important takeaway from her story.\u201d\n\nWhy there\u2019s no reliable way to test for ovarian cancer\u2014and what\u2019s recommended instead\n\nMuch of the current wisdom around screening comes out of the disappointing 2021 results of a U.K.-based clinical trial that followed 200,000 women for more than 20 years, concluding that screening and symptom awareness do not save lives.\n\nThe trial, which was the largest of its kind in the world, randomized patients into three groups: 1) no screening, 2) annual screening with ultrasound, and 3) annual screening with ultrasound and CA-125 blood test. It found no evidence of lives saved in the groups that were tested. \u201cWe therefore cannot recommend ovarian cancer screening for the general population using these methods,\u201d lead investigator Dr. Usha Menon noted at the time.\n\n\u201cThis is what\u2019s tricky and devastating about ovarian cancer, that it needs to be caught so much earlier, we think, in order for it to impact mortality,\u201d says DeFeo. \u201cIt\u2019s not about catching it three months earlier\u2026 We need to find a way to catch this disease years earlier.\u201d\n\nBut as of now, that\u2019s not possible. \u201cThe technology doesn\u2019t exist,\u201d she says. Plus, adds Hanley, most cases of ovarian cancer appear to originate in the fallopian tubes\u2014which are not easily reached or biopsied.\n\nIt\u2019s why OCRA\u2019s recommendation officially switched last year from symptom awareness and early detection to something else entirely: the preventative removal of one\u2019s fallopian tubes, called a salpingectomy. It\u2019s an approach that has been endorsed by the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists (ACOG) since 2015.\n\nThe recommendation applies not only to those who test positive for high genetic risk, such as with BRCA-1 or BRCA-2 gene mutations, but also for all women planning to undergo another pelvic surgery (such as with a hysterectomy, endometriosis, or removal of cysts) if they are finished or not planning on having kids. (For women with the higher risk, an oophorectomy, or prophylactic removal of ovaries, is also recommended.)\n\n\u201cSo again, we\u2019re not saying that your regular woman on the street needs to go in and have this elective surgery,\u201d says DeFeo. \u201cBut we know that hundreds of thousands of women are having surgery every year anyway, for a different reason, where they could take the opportunity to take out their tubes at the same time, potentially. It\u2019s something that they should talk to their doctor about, and it\u2019s something that doctors should be thinking about.\u201d\n\nHow to approach genetic testing\n\nBesides salpingectomy, the other most powerful tool in ovarian cancer prevention is genetic testing, which you can begin by looking at your family history. \u201cI know that in many families that can be hard,\u201d says DeFeo. \u201cBut to the extent that you can look at your family history, and if you have a family history of cancer, especially breast and ovarian cancers, and especially at a young age\u2026those are red flags.\u201d\n\nHanley adds that it is important to look at both sides of your family. \u201cThere is a misconception that family history is only relevant on your mother\u2019s side, but you can inherit a BRCA mutation from your father as well,\u201d she says. \u201cSo on either side of your family, if there is a history of breast or ovarian cancer, potentially even prostate or pancreatic cancers, then getting a BRCA test is a very good idea.\u201d\n\nThen, talk to your doctor about getting it started.\n\nDeFeo notes that genetic testing is more accessible than ever. \u201cA lot of insurance covers it. It really depends on each person\u2019s situation, but the cost of testing has come down dramatically over the course of the years,\u201d she says. \u201cSo it is increasingly accessible. And OCRA, for example, offers a free genetic testing program.\u201d\n\nFrom there, if you are positive, prophylactic surgeries would be recommended, as was the case with Evert.\n\n\u201cShe would never have been symptomatic,\u201d says Hanley. \u201cThere\u2019s no screening method that would have picked that up. The only reason that cancer was diagnosed is because her fallopian tubes were removed and then they were very, very carefully analyzed by a pathologist\u2026and that doesn\u2019t occur outside of the case of a BRCA mutation.\u201d\n\nBut Hanley, like others in the field, is counting on that to change. \u201cWe\u2019re all hopeful that with technology and better understanding, we may still one day be able to develop a screening method that works,\u201d she says. \u201cBut we\u2019re a long way away from that.\u201d\n\nMore on cancer:",

        "body": "Talk of the office and its pandemic-powered apocalypse might have died down, but the sector\u2019s troubles haven\u2019t. If anything, four years after the pandemic\u2019s onset, office vacancies are growing.\n\nIn the second quarter of this year, \u201cthe office sector set a record vacancy rate at 20.1%, breaking the 20% barrier for the first time in history,\u201d a Moody\u2019s analysis published today read. \u201cThe slow bleed occurring in the office sector has led to a steady rise in the vacancy rate as permanent shifts in working behavior have outlasted the initial wave of the pandemic four years ago.\u201d\n\nIn the prior quarter, as Fortune previously reported, the office vacancy rate had already reached 19.8%, which was 50 basis points above recessionary peaks recorded in 1986 and 1991, according to Moody\u2019s.\n\n\u201cThe two historic peaks came as a result of underlying macroeconomic conditions,\u201d Nick Luettke, coauthor of the previous analysis and associate economist, told Fortune at the time. \u201cThe 1986 vacancy rise came as the result of surging supply with high construction levels, while 1991 came as a result of the previous decade of construction fusing with greater economic uncertainty at the time.\u201d\n\n\u2018A lasting shift\u2019 in work habits\n\nThis time around, as we know, demand plummeted thanks to remote work, but interest rates were an issue too\u2014the Federal Reserve raised rates multiple times to tame surging inflation that reached a four-decade high in 2022. All commercial real estate is sensitive to interest rates, and after a decade of cheap money, higher rates were especially painful. Still, while interest rates will eventually come down, the issue of demeaning demand, it seems, will remain prevalent.\n\n\u201cThe current turbulence in the office sector has a different root cause than previous peaks,\u201d Moody\u2019s said today. \u201cRather than macroeconomic uncertainty, a lasting shift is occurring in the sector as we near equilibrium of working models four years after inflection point of the pandemic.\u201d\n\nNot to mention, Ross Perot Jr., chairman of the Perot Group and Hillwood, once told Fortune that \u201cit\u2019ll be years before we really understand the damage the pandemic did to the world.\u201d For one, he said, \u201cit broke the habit patterns of millions of people that used to go to work every day in a real office.\u201d\n\nThat lack of demand translates to falling rents. In the second quarter of the year, effective rents fell 0.1%, and 0.5% in the last year. Rent growth was positive in 2021 and 2022, but that changed, and rents have been negative or flat for four consecutive quarters, according to the analysis. Meanwhile, net absorption (which essentially refers to the total amount of space that\u2019s been leased, minus the amount of space that\u2019s been vacated for a certain period) was at -13.6 million square feet in the second quarter, the worst it\u2019s been in almost three years.\n\n\u201cThe office sector\u2019s rising vacancy rate highlights the sector\u2019s current struggles, and there\u2019s natural concern over how high the rate will continue to climb,\u201d the analysis read. At this moment, the economy is doing fine on paper, which could be beneficial for offices. Still, \u201cthe future direction and speed of the vacancy rate will hinge on the Federal Reserve\u2019s navigation of the soft landing.\u201d\n\nSo far, the Fed seems set to cut interest rates a single time this year following hotter-than-expected inflation reports. It\u2019s not clear how much one rate cut would help the office sector, but it faces a much bigger problem of fading necessity\u2014and on that measure, the office world hasn\u2019t fared too well. For its part, Capital Economics predicted office values will fall more than 40% from peak to trough by the end of next year, with no recovery even by 2040 (a more haunting revision from the firm\u2019s prior call). Still, Moody\u2019s head of commercial real estate analysis, Kevin Fagan, once told Fortune he expected vacancies to begin to fall after next year.",

        "body": "Say what you will about Tom Brady, there\u2019s no undercutting his singularity\u2014or the endless fascination with how he \u201cgets it done.\u201d\n\nDuring his momentous football career, the longtime New England Patriots quarterback won seven Super Bowl rings\u2014the most of any player, ever\u2014and garnered a reputation for being fastidious and disciplined. (TB12, anyone?)\n\nIn his second act, Brady has pivoted toward everything from NFTs to FTX to sports commentating to, most recently, partnering with Delta Air Lines as an advisor. He appeared opposite CEO Ed Bastian on Delta\u2019s Gaining Altitude podcast this week to discuss his virtues and values and reflect on what\u2019s put him ahead of the pack.\n\n\u201cOne of the key fundamentals to my personal success\u2014and our team\u2019s success, over a long period of time\u2014is that nobody was afraid of constructive criticism,\u201d Brady, 49, told Bastian. Criticism \u201creally means you cared about the other person. I always felt like the people that I cared about the most, I was going to have those tough conversations about what I thought they needed to do to improve.\u201d\n\nWhether that meant Brady noticed shoddy preparation for a game, or hot-and-cold emotional approaches, he said he almost thought it would be a disservice not to call his teammates out. And the team superstar wasn\u2019t immune. \u201cI wanted everyone to have that with me, too; I had to be open to their constructive criticism. I got that from the owner, from the head coach, and from my position coach; I never wanted to feel like they couldn\u2019t coach me.\u201d\n\nIndeed, it was critical for both Brady\u2019s bosses and peers to \u201cfeel like they were in a position of authority\u201d to tell him he needed to up his game. Granted, he may not have needed much coaching, particularly in his highest-performing, record-breaking years.\n\n\u201cThe easy thing for me was to be like, \u2018Don\u2019t you understand? I\u2019m Tom Brady. I won this before. I\u2019ve been MVP,\u2019\u201d he remarked. \u201cBut that\u2019d be the worst thing to do.\u201d Fearing an echo chamber, where all that his peers and coaches did was indulge him, Brady told Bastian he made a point to ensure everyone in his midst knew he was open to criticism.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m always one of the teammates. I needed to relate to all the guys,\u201d Brady said. \u201cMaybe I did develop a higher standard of performance over a period of time, but I was lucky, because I had a lot of experience.\u201d\n\nThat divide led Brady to his main ethos, to which he credited his ongoing success: never getting jaded. \u201cSome of these guys were brand-new, but I wanted them to treat me like it was my first day on the job, too,\u201d he said.\n\nPart and parcel of a first-day-on-the-job mentality is maintaining balance, he added. \u201dIt\u2019s always about regulating the inputs and outputs; when I really need to put out a lot of energy and emotion, I had to make sure I had it left in the tank,\u201d he said. \u201cI really had to make sure I was conscious about what I was doing the day before the game and what I was doing after the game.\u201d\n\nAs the undisputed star, Brady said his teams\u2014and fans\u2014needed him consistently at 100% in focus, determination, concentration, and energy. That calls for the right food, the right hydration, the right bodywork, and critically, \u201cthe right people around me.\u201d Ideally, people who can call him out when he\u2019s slacking.",

        "title": "Fed Chair Jerome Powell says inflation is on the downswing\u2014but don\u2019t expect rate cuts yet",
        "body": "Inflation in the United States is slowing again after higher readings earlier this year, Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell said Tuesday, while adding that more such evidence would be needed before the Fed would cut interest rates.\n\nAfter some persistently high inflation reports at the start of 2024, Powell said, the data for April and May \u201cdo suggest we are getting back on a disinflationary path.\u201d\n\nSpeaking in a panel discussion at the European Central Bank\u2019s monetary policy conference in Sintra, Portugal, Powell said Fed officials still want to see annual price growth slow further toward their 2% target before they would feel confident of having fully defeated high inflation.\n\n\u201cWe just want to understand that the levels that we\u2019re seeing are a true reading of underlying inflation,\u201d he added.\n\nPowell also acknowledged that the Fed is treading a fine line as it weighs when to cut its benchmark interest rate, which it raised 11 times from March 2022 through July 2023 to its current level of 5.3%. The rate hikes were intended to curb the worst streak of inflation in four decades by slowing borrowing and spending by consumers and businesses. Inflation did tumble from its peak in 2022 yet still remains elevated.\n\nIf the Fed cuts rates too soon, Powell cautioned, inflation could re-accelerate, forcing the policymakers to reverse course and impose punishing rate hikes. But if the Fed waits too long to reduce borrowing costs, it risks weakening the economy so much as to potentially cause a recession.\n\n\u201cGetting the balance on monetary policy right during this critical period \u2014 that\u2019s really what I think about in the wee hours,\u201d Powell said in response to a question about his top worries.\n\nOn Friday, the government reported that consumer prices, according to the Fed\u2019s preferred measure, were unchanged from April to May, the mildest such reading in more than four years. And compared with a year earlier, inflation dropped to just 2.6% in May, from 2.7% in April, the government said.\n\nExcluding volatile food and energy costs, \u201ccore\u201d prices also barely rose from April to May. On a year-over-year basis, core inflation fell to 2.6% from 2.8% in April. The latest inflation figures were a sharp improvement from early this year.\n\nIn his appearance Tuesday, Powell said the U.S. economy and job market remain fundamentally healthy, which means the Fed can take its time in deciding when rate cuts are appropriate. Most economists think the Fed\u2019s first rate cut will occur in September, with potentially another cut to follow by year\u2019s end.\n\nThe Fed chair also said the job market is \u201ccooling off appropriately,\u201d which likely means that it won\u2019t heighten inflationary pressures through rapid wage gains.\n\n\u201cIt doesn\u2019t look like it\u2019s heating up or presenting a big problem for inflation going forward,\u201d Powell said of the job market. \u201cIt looks like it\u2019s doing just what you would want it to do, which is to cool off over time.\u201d\n\nPowell declined to signal any time frame for a rate cut. Investors are betting that there is nearly a 70% chance for a reduction at the Fed\u2019s meeting in September.\n\nFed officials have expressed a range of views on inflation and interest-rate policy since their last meeting a little over two weeks ago.\n\nJohn Williams, president of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York and vice chair of the central bank\u2019s rate-setting committee, said last week, \u201cI am confident that we at the Fed are on a path to achieving our 2% inflation goal on a sustained basis.\u201d\n\nMary Daly, president of the San Francisco Fed, cautioned last week, though, that it was \u201chard to know if we are truly on track to sustainable price stability.\u201d\n\nIn his appearance Tuesday in Portugal, Powell spoke at a panel along with Christine Lagarde, president of the European Central Bank, and Roberto Campos Neto, the head of Brazil\u2019s central bank.\n\nThe ECB has already made a quarter-point cut to its key rate this year, with inflation in the 20-nation eurozone having sunk from above 10% to just 2.5%.\n\nIn her remarks Tuesday, though, Lagarde reiterated that the ECB is not on any \u201cpredetermined path\u201d and that its recent rate cut \u201cwould be followed by further review of data.\u201d\n\nSuch comments have led many analysts to conclude that the ECB\u2019s next rate cut won\u2019t occur until September at the earliest.",

        "title": "Nicotine use: Stringent policies drive mushrooming black market",
        "body": "Nicotine use can be traced back to 12,300 years ago. Global tobacco trends show a decline, with 1.25 billion people still smoking.\n\nAccording to the World Health Organisation (WHO), 19 million stopped smoking two years ago which is a positive step. However, the demand for nicotine is persistent and unlikely to dissipate.\n\nNicotine consumption regulation should balance harm reduction, consumer protection, and realistic expectations about human behaviour while facilitating informed consumer choice. Basic safety standards are non-negotiable, and products must not contain harmful substances.\n\nRegulation should provide consumers with accurate information and ensure transparent and trustworthy manufacturing and marketing without stifling innovation. Regulating harm-reduction products is simpler than perceived.\n\nAttempts to curb nicotine use through prohibition or aggressive regulation have not only failed but often exacerbated the problem.\n\nFor instance, Australia\u2019s stringent anti-nicotine policies have not eradicated nicotine use; instead, they have driven it underground, creating a black market fraught with unregulated and potentially hazardous products. The same has been observed in India.\n\nRegulation must be justified on its merits. Over-regulation can limit consumer choice and drive people towards unregulated, potentially dangerous products. Therefore, regulatory measures should be carefully evaluated for their effectiveness and unintended consequences.\n\nUnderstanding consumer behaviour is the key to effective regulation.\n\nConsumers make choices based on a variety of factors, including convenience, social influences, and product satisfaction\u2014not solely on health risks. Regulation should, therefore, address information deficits, providing consumers with clear, truthful information about the relative risks and benefits of different nicotine products.\n\nInformed choice is not merely about access to information but also about ensuring the information is understandable and actionable. Consumers are not experts in aerosol chemistry or toxicology; they rely on regulators to set standards that ensure the safety and quality of the products they use. The regulation of nicotine products, therefore, requires a balanced approach that acknowledges the persistent demand for nicotine and the complex motivations behind its use.\n\nIt is crucial to prioritize harm reduction and guide smokers toward safer alternatives. The WHO acknowledges harm reduction as a principle but often favours prohibition over harm reduction, which can lead to adverse consequences. Banning flavours and e-cigarettes may result in black markets. Regulations should enable informed choices and ensure product safety without driving consumers to unregulated markets.\n\nThe fear that children are taking up smoking new nicotine products due to the use of different flavours in the product still does not justify prohibition. As argued earlier, harm reduction products are much easier to regulate than invisible products which are sold underground. Unregulated products in a black market are much more dangerous to consume and will still get into the hands of children if parental oversight is present.\n\nThe debate over tobacco harm reduction and e-cigarettes is complicated by conflicting scientific evidence, which can influence public opinion and policy decisions. E-cigarettes present risks, especially for young people and non-smokers, but also offer a harm reduction tool for adult smokers. Misunderstandings about nicotine and the misuse of data further complicate the issue. Transparent research funding and rigorous peer review are essential to restoring trust in the scientific process.\n\nMoreover, the influence of vested interests cannot be overlooked. Industry-funded studies and biased reporting have historically skewed perceptions, reinforcing the need for independent replication and rigorous peer review. Transparency in research funding and disclosure of conflicts of interest are essential to restoring credibility and trust in the scientific process.\n\nPolicy implications loom large in this arena. Flawed science can lead to regulations that harm public health. Balancing youth protection with harm reduction for adult smokers requires evidence-based policymaking grounded in comprehensive data.\n\nMoving forward, we must champion a culture of skepticism and rigorous inquiry. Embracing post-publication peer review and promoting interdisciplinary collaboration can fortify the integrity of research in tobacco harm reduction. Empowering consumers with accurate information and encouraging open dialogue between stakeholders will foster a more nuanced public discourse, free from the distortions of bad science.\n\nEffective tobacco harm reduction policy demands a commitment to evidence, ethics, and empathy. By prioritising public health and scientific integrity, we can navigate the complexities of vaping with clarity and compassion, forging a future where informed choices lead to healthier communities.",

        "body": "The Treasury faces pressure to raise at least an extra Sh1.07 billion annually to finance a new salary deal for Cabinet secretaries, governors, MPs, MCAs and other top State officers that falls due this month, computations show, amid financial strain.\n\nA new schedule of salaries and benefits for State officers fell due on July 1 in line with an August 9,2023 gazette notice by the Salaries and Remuneration Commission (SRC).\n\n\u201cMonthly remuneration structure for State officers in the Executive of the national government to be implemented in the financial year 2024/2025, with effect from July 1, 2024,\u201d said the SRC in the notice.\n\nComputations showed that the Treasury will require at least Sh10.92 billion annually to handle the new salaries and allowances\u2014piling pressure on the Exchequer already hard hit by economic turmoil. Currently, the Treasury spends at least Sh9.85 billion annually on salaries and allowances of the top officers.\n\nThe gazette notice by the SRC said the salaries of Prime Cabinet Secretary Musalia Mudavadi, the 22 Cabinet secretaries, Attorney General Justin Muturi, Head of Public Service Felix Koskei and Secretary to the Cabinet Mercy Wanjau will hit Sh990,000 each up from Sh957,000.\n\nMPs and Senators, whose salary is Sh725,502 will have their pay increased to Sh739,600 monthly.\n\nA governor\u2018s pay has been adjusted from Sh957,000 to Sh990,000 while that of an MCA\u2019s will increase from Sh154,481 to Sh164,588 monthly.\n\nGoing by these new bands, it will require at least Sh744.83million to pay monthly salaries alone, exclusive of allowances that vary based on circumstances such as travel and engagements.\n\nCompared to the current compensation terms, it means that the Treasury will need a minimum extra Sh30 million monthly or Sh360 million annually to meet the salaries.\n\nSRC chairperson Lyn Mengich, however, said the implementation of the proposed salary raises is subject to \u201cavailability of funds and fiscal sustainability\u201d.\n\nThe new salary increases come at a time when President William Ruto is facing public protests to cut wasteful spending and reduce the taxation burden on ordinary citizens.\n\nDr Ruto, whose administration has come under pressure for wasteful spending since the anti-tax protests started, directed for implementation of austerity measures that would involve expenditure cuts affecting all levels of government.\n\nIn an address to the nation following the deadly protests spearheaded by the Generation Z directed budget cuts on non-essential expenditures in his office, including travel, hospitality, and the purchase of motor vehicles to curb wastage of funds and plug a Sh346 billion hole occasioned by the now abandoned controversial Finance Bill 2024.\n\nUnder the new salary structure, the pay for the Speaker of the National Assembly and the Senate who currently earn Sh1,185,327 will rise to Sh1,208,362 while that of the Deputy Speakers of both Houses will hit Sh966,690, up from Sh948,261.\n\nThe Leader of the Majority and Minority Parties in both Houses will take home Sh800,019 while a Member of the National Assembly/Senate will earn Sh739,600 monthly.

        "title": "Explainer: The Appropriation Bill and why it matters",
        "body": "This is a proposed law that reveals how revenues raised from taxes and fines are spent in a fiscal year by ministries and other agencies and details expenditure area such as wages and salaries, travel, hospitality, renovations and purchase of goods and services.\n\nThe Appropriation Bill, once approved by Parliament and the President, forms the basis for withdrawal of funds from the government\u2019s main accounts or the Consolidated Fund for State operations.\n\nThe Appropriation Bill, which is now 2024 Appropriation Act after President William Ruto assented to the proposed law, will guide spending for the financial year that started on Monday or July 1 to June 30, 2025.\n\nWhy does the bill matter?\n\nWithout the Appropriation Bill, the government would not be able to spend a significant share of the previous year\u2019s spending plan because the proposed law required withdrawing funds from the government\u2019s main account. For instance, the government would only spend up to 50 percent of its previously approved budget in the absence of a new Appropriation Act.\n\nWhat is the relationship between Appropriation Bill and Finance Bill?\n\nThe Appropriation Bill details areas of spending or the budget while the Finance Bill highlights new tax/revenue raising measures for each near fiscal year. While different, the two bills are tied at the hip as they are expected to be tabled together in Parliament and form the critical part of the annual budget statement presented by the National Treasury Cabinet Secretary every June.\n\nBoth bills also earned a new similarity this year as Kenyans protested new taxes while at the same time demanding a recalibration of spending to eliminate wasteful expenditures.\n\nWhy did President sign the Appropriation Bill into law amid public concerns over State spending?\n\nLast week, President William Ruto assented to the Appropriation Bill, allowing the drawing of funds from government accounts for use in accordance to the approved spending plans by the National Assembly. He has, however, attempted to appease public concerns by authorising Treasury to work on spending cuts equivalent to Sh346 billion to cover the hole created by the expected withdrawal of the Finance Bill which contained new revenue raising measures.\n\nPresident Ruto says cuts will cover his office including a slash on travel, hospitality and renovation budgets while the Treasury is expected to work with Parliament, the Judiciary and devolved units to cut discretionary spending to achieve deep budget cuts.\n\nWhat would have happened if President Ruto refused to sign the Appropriation Bill?\n\nJust like he refused to sign the 2024 Finance Bill following deadly protests, President Ruto would have equally rejected the Appropriation bill by writing to Parliament and instructing MPs to delete all clauses to the legislation as has been the case with proposed tax/revenue raising measures.\n\nUnlike the Finance Bill where the State can rely on existing tax measures, the absence of a new Appropriation Act would have seen the government resort to a backup measure to access funding to support about 50 percent of the most recent approved spending plan.\n\nThe government would then reconstitute a new Appropriation Bill capturing changes to its spending plan to unlock full access to State accounts.\n\nHow does withdrawal of Financing Bill and signing of Appropriations Bill into law affect counties?\n\nThe Appropriation Bill is closely tied to the Division of Revenue Bill (Dora) which splits spending between the national and county governments. President William Ruto has proposed changes to the bill to capture expected spending cuts as the State rationalised spending across both levels of government.\n\nReverting Dora to Parliament means Counties are likely to face delays in receiving the first disbursements from the national government covering the 2024/25 financial year.\n\nLike the Appropriation Bill, Dora holds the key to releasing funds to the 47 devolved units.\n\nWhat happens to the Appropriation Act after the withdrawal of Finance Bill 2024?\n\nThe Treasury is expected to work with three arms of government to identify areas of discretionary spending which will either be withdrawn completely or trimmed with the goal of delivering at least Sh346 billion in lower expenditures for the 2024/25 financial year.\n\nThe proposed cuts will then be presented to Parliament and passed as the first supplementary budget estimates and will result in the Appropriation (Amendment) Bill no.1 of 2024 to be assented to by the President.\n\nBefore that, Parliament upon the resumption of regular sittings on July 26 will consider the proposed changes to the Division of Revenue Act which will in effect lower the counties equitable share from Sh401 billion at present.",

        "title": "Want to lay off staff? Here's why it might be bad for your business",
        "body": "Earlier this year, an old story about former Nintendo CEO Satoru Iwata went viral, posthumously praising him for taking a 50 percent salary cut rather than laying off staff.\n\nWhy would a story from 2013 suddenly make headlines? Likely because it provided such a stark contrast to current trends in North America, where employee layoffs are reaching levels not seen since the dot-com crash of the early 2000s.\n\nThe tech sector is being hit particularly hard. According to NPR, 2023 was \"a bloodbath for the tech industry, with more than 260,000 jobs vanishing.\"\n\nThe cuts were blamed on a post-pandemic hiring binge and high inflation, which lowered consumer demand. Yet, the layoff trend continues into 2024. According to NPR, tech companies collectively laid off approximately 25,000 employees during the first four weeks of this year.\n\nWhile some layoffs are inevitable due to basic economic cycles of recession and growth, they seem increasingly to be a method for CEOs to please shareholders by providing small, short-term bumps to a company's bottom line.\n\nI think it's a short-sighted approach that reduces workers to data points and budget line items while ignoring the value of retaining employees over the long term, even when economic times are tough.\n\nAs Iwata said shortly after announcing his personal salary cut, \"If we reduce the number of employees for better short-term financial results, employee morale will decrease. I sincerely doubt employees who fear that they may be laid off will be able to develop software titles that could impress people around the world.\"\n\nThe reflexive instinct among many CEOs today seems to be a throwback to the Jack Welch brand of management of the 1980s. Welch, the CEO of General Electric from 1981 to 2001, was known for being relentless in his pursuit of profit and his preferred method for achieving it: firing employees. According to a profile in the New Yorker, \"no single corporate executive in history has fired as many people as Jack Welch did.\"\n\nHe pioneered the \"ranking and yanking\" method, in which he developed a grading scale for employees and fired the bottom 10 percent every year. His ruthless style was revered at the time. But his legacy is mixed, with much of his success attributed to financial chicanery.\n\nWhile his management style eventually lost favour in the 2000s and 2010s, CEOs' desire to prune workforces for short-term relief seems to be gaining new momentum.\n\nBut does it improve a company's bottom line in the long run? Even small cuts can quickly change a company's culture, causing employees to go into self-preservation mode and stifling innovation and creativity.\n\nI know all too well how costly it can be to lose long-term, loyal staff due to extreme circumstances. Like countless other companies and not-for-profits, my charitable organisation had no choice but to lay off staff in response to the Covid-19 pandemic. It was one of the most difficult decisions I have ever made because I know the value employees at all levels can bring to an organization and the impact it would have on those employees' lives.\n\nAnd it's a decision that rarely pays off in the long run. According to a report in Time, layoffs can often harm a company's financial performance over time. They don't consistently boost profits and can lead to lower employee engagement and customer service quality.\n\nConversely, while it doesn't always show up on a balance sheet, there are so many benefits to fostering an environment where employees feel safe and valued and want to stay with a company in the long term.\n\nThe majority of my team has been with our organisation for over ten years, with many in the 15- \u2014to 20-year range, and I see the benefits of that dynamic every day. Employees who feel emotionally safe in their jobs provide a challenging function that is critical to decision-making and are loyal to their organisation, something that can only be earned through mutual trust.\n\nEmpowered employees work harder because they are invested in long-term outcomes. They know that they will be around long enough to see their contributions come to fruition and are not just on a one or two-year stop before looking for their next job.\n\nThey are also comfortable taking risks and driving innovation. Too often, companies achieve a level of success and become complacent and risk-averse, which ultimately leads them on a path to failure. That's why loyal and dedicated employees are so critical. They have the security to challenge leadership to continue innovating and driving impact or speak up when they see their leaders making potentially bad decisions.\n\nA stable workforce also fosters better relationships with clients and suppliers, creating continuity and consumer confidence. A company constantly cutting and adding jobs cannot effectively maintain these relationships or conduct effective, long-term business planning.\n\nRetaining an engaged workforce is particularly important in the era of \"quiet quitting,\" in which disengaged employees do the bare minimum level of work to keep themselves employed. This trend is not surprising given that so many employees are worried they could be cut at any moment. That insecurity can also fuel the tendency of employees to take on a side gig that will give them a softer landing if they are cut.",

        "title": "Communication: What fueled Gen Z riots",
        "body": "Kenya is witnessing a wave of national outrage and riots, a clear indication that, among other things, the government's communication strategy has faltered on multiple fronts.\n\nFirst, A notable failure that preceded the national outrage has been the government's lack of engagement with the voices of the people. When citizens feel unheard, their frustration grows, leading to a heightened sense of alienation and anger.\n\nThis lack of listening contributed significantly to the fever-pitch outrage observed across the country. Effective communication is a two-way street. It is not enough for leaders to simply broadcast their messages; they must also listen to the needs, interests, concerns, and expectations of their audience.\n\nSecondly, the information disseminated to the public has consistently lacked the necessary depth and clarity to address the concerns of the people. When citizens feel that their needs and questions are not being met with transparent and substantial responses, it fuels uncertainty and fear, contributing to unrest and anger.\n\nIn times of crisis, citizens look to their leaders for clear, consistent, and resonant information. Yet, most of the messages by the government have not reflected the mood and desires of the people, possibly pointing to a situation where message drafters did not incorporate insights from strategic listening, if they had listened at all. The absence of insights-driven messaging has led to confusion and mistrust.\n\nThirdly, the Kenyan public has continually observed discrepancies between what is communicated and what is done. Inconsistency between messages and actions undermines the credibility of leadership, as people struggle to reconcile the differences between words and deeds.\n\nSuch contradictions not only erode trust but also provide fertile ground for rumors and misinformation, which can rapidly escalate into widespread dissent and protests.\n\nThe need for seasoned communication experts within government cannot be overstated. They facilitate strategic listening to the public by establishing channels of genuine engagement, allowing citizens to voice their concerns and feel heard. Strategic listening fosters a sense of inclusion and significantly reduce feelings of alienation and anger. When Kenyans believe their voices matter, they will be less likely to resort to protests.\n\nIt takes experienced communication professionals to craft messages that are clear, consistent, and resonate with the public. They understand the importance of strategic messaging that incorporates the needs, interests, concerns, and expectations of the people. They therefore, ensure that the information disseminated is coherent and trustworthy. This then reduces confusion and builds a foundation of trust between the government and its citizens.\n\nWhat's more, one of the most critical aspects of effective communication is ensuring that actions align with words. Seasoned communication experts understand that for messages to be credible, they must be backed by concrete actions. They can advise government leaders on how to implement policies and initiatives that reflect their statements, ensuring consistency between what is said and what is done. This alignment is essential for building and maintaining trust.\n\nWhen citizens see that their government not only listens to them but also acts on their feedback and concerns, they will likely be pacified. Moreover, an openness to acknowledge mistakes and correct them transparently can further enhance trust and cooperation, ultimately leading to a more stable and harmonious society.\n\nIn times of crisis, communication experts are crucial in managing the narrative and mitigating panic. They can anticipate public reactions and prepare strategic responses that address concerns before they escalate.\n\nThe recent riots underscore the devastating impact of poor communication. There is need for a regulatory framework governing the practice of public relations in Kenya. By instituting a law that mandates the engagement of seasoned communication professionals and sets standards for strategic listening, message crafting, and aligning actions with words, the Kenya government will ensure more reliable and effective communication.\n\nA PR law will not only professionalise communication efforts but also protect public interest by fostering transparency, trust, and accountability.",

        "body": "The US has warned that Kenya\u2019s rising debt burden is undermining its ability to provide quality medical care and education to its services, shining the spotlight on expensive debt procured in the last decade partly from China.\n\nWashington said elevated debt servicing costs are taking up a larger chunk of taxes, leaving little for development projects in social services and spurring the creation of decent jobs for the rising number of skilled youthful population.\n\n\u201cKenya\u2019s ability to adequately fund its social services [which include education, healthcare, and housing] and poverty reduction programmes is increasingly constrained by the cost of servicing its debt, partly due to the continued weakening of the local currency,\u201d Office of the United States Trade Representative said in a newly published biennial report on the implementation of the African Growth and Opportunity Act.\n\n\u201cAs a result, Kenya continues to allocate more money for debt repayment than it does for development expenditures.\u201d\n\nThe ballooning debt servicing expenses have in recent years overtaken expenditures on salaries and wages, administration, operation, and maintenance of public offices for the national government. This underlines the impact of commercial and semi-concessional loans that Kenya has contracted in the last decade to put up much-needed roads, bridges, power plants, and a modern railway line.\n\nLatest disclosures from the Treasury, for instance, show debt repayment costs gobbled up an equivalent of three-quarters (75.47 percent) of taxes collected in 11 months of the just-ended financial year.\n\nThis is after the Treasury spent nearly Sh1.46 trillion on repaying interest and principal sums of Kenya\u2019s domestic and foreign debt in a period when taxes amounted to Sh1.93 trillion.\n\nThe expenditure on debts was Sh342.98 billion more than Sh1.11 trillion, which went into paying salaries and allowances as well as administration, operation, and maintenance of offices for the government.\n\nThe increased expenditure on debt repayments has hit the hardest development projects, which received Sh261.15 billion directly, an equivalent of 10.04 percent of the total Sh2.6 trillion expenditure in the 11 months ended June 2024.\n\nThe concerns by Washington have come on the back of the US and her Western allies increasing scrutiny on secretive clauses in loans that China has offered African countries.\n\nA study by AidData, a research laboratory at the College of William & Mary in the US, found that the terms of Beijing\u2019s loan deals with developing countries were usually secretive and required borrowing nations such as Kenya to prioritise repayment to Chinese state-owned lenders ahead of other creditors.\n\nThe dataset, based on an analysis of loan agreements between 2000 and 2019, suggested the Chinese deals have clauses for \u201cmore elaborate repayment safeguards\u201d than its \u201cpeers in the official credit market\u201d.\n\nThe terms further \u201cgive Chinese lenders an advantage over other creditors\u201d, the findings of the study suggested.\n\nKenya paid China Sh152.69 billion for interest and principal sums falling due in the financial year ended June 2024, 42.14 percent more than Sh107.42 billion in the year that ended June 2023.\n\nThe US says increasing debt obligations, corruption, and the lingering effects of the pandemic on household and company earnings have nearly paralysed Kenya\u2019s march towards an \u201cindustrialising, middle-income country that provides a high standard of living to all its citizens by 2030, in a clean and secure environment\u201d.",

        "body": "The Nairobi Securities Exchange (NSE) posted the highest returns among African bourses in dollar terms in the first half of the year, buoyed by a stronger shilling and higher blue chip share prices that saw investor wealth at the market rise by Sh291 billion in the period.\n\nThe appreciation of the shilling by 21.74 percent against the dollar this year has handed foreign investors extra returns on top of the capital gains enjoyed on blue chip stocks at the NSE, helping them beat other markets where currencies have not performed as well against the greenback.\n\nThe Kenyan market had a return of 50.4 percent according to the Morgan Stanley Capital International (MSCI) Index for the six months to June, beating Zimbabwe (34.4 percent), Mauritius (8.0 percent) and Morocco (6.8 percent) which were the other top African performers in the frontier and emerging markets indices.\n\nSouth Africa, C\u00f4te d'Ivoire, Senegal and Tunisia had returns of between 2.9 and 5.9 percent, while Egypt and Nigeria\u2019s six-month dollar returns were in the negative at -33 percent and -73 percent respectively.\n\nThe MSCI index is a key source of investment information for foreign investors, tracking the top stocks in selected countries based on their market capitalisation, liquidity and financial performance.\n\nIn Kenya, the MSCI tracks four blue chips\u2014Safaricom, Equity Group, EABL and KCB Group\u2014 which together account for 62 percent of the NSE\u2019s total market capitalisation of Sh1.71 trillion.\n\nIn the six months to June 2024, Safaricom\u2019s stock price gained 24.5 percent to Sh17.30, while Equity\u2019s was up by 25.6 percent to Sh42.25. EABL\u2019s stock was up by 28.7 percent to Sh146.75, and KCB\u2019s share gained 42.7 percent to Sh31.25.\n\nThese gains on the NSE\u2019s four largest stocks helped it record a Sh271.62 billion increase in investor wealth in the period. The benchmark NSE 20 Share Index was up 10.3 percent to 1,656.50 points, while the all-inclusive NSE All Share Index gained 18.9 percent to 109.49 points.\n\nIn the comparative period in 2023, the NSE had shed Sh319.8 billion in market capitalisation, while the NSE 20 Share Index and the All Share Index were down by six percent and 16.1 percent respectively.\n\nForeign investors have meanwhile recorded net inflows of Sh749 million in the six-months to June 2024, compared with net outflows of Sh15.41 billion in the first half of 2023.\n\nThe sentiment around the market has however improved this year, mirroring the wider economy where investor jitters over the shilling and the country\u2019s foreign debt sustainability have eased following the successful refinancing of the $2 billion 2014 Eurobond that matured last month.\n\nInflation has also eased since the beginning of the year, falling to 4.6 percent in June 2024 from 6.63 percent in December 2023.\n\nFor foreign investors, the weakening of the shilling and lack of access to dollars were the biggest concerns going into 2024, negatively affecting their participation and inflows into the market.\n\nThese fears eased from the second quarter of the year after the refinancing of the Eurobond and Central Bank of Kenya (CBK) led reforms to the forex interbank market.\n\nThe resolution of the dollar supply hitches resulted in the removal in April and May of restrictions placed on the Kenya stock market in 2022 by the MSCI and fellow global index provider Financial Times Stock Exchange (FTSE) Russell Index.\n\nThe two index providers had put the NSE under watch after investors reported difficulties accessing dollars from the local forex market to repatriate dividends and proceeds of share sales.\n\nThese cautions to foreign investors discouraged inward foreign flows into the Kenyan market, while those already holding shares refrained from trading to avoid the hassle of seeking dollars in a difficult forex market.\n\nThe weakening of the shilling between 2022 and 2023 also discouraged trading, as investors sought to avoid exchange losses upon exit.\n\nForeign investors usually exchange their dollars for shillings when entering the market, and buy dollars when exiting for repatriation abroad.\n\nIf the shilling strengthens against the dollar between the period of entry and exit, they end up with an exchange rate gain since they would get more dollars for their shillings when buying hard currency for repatriation of gains abroad. On the other hand, a weakening shilling hands them an exchange loss on their investment.\n\nA foreign investor entering the Kenyan market at the beginning of 2024 with an investment of $100,000 would have Sh15.65 million in shilling equivalent going by the exchange rate of Sh156.64 to the dollar at the beginning of January.",

        "body": "Earnings from tourism hit a record high of Sh352.54 billion last year driven by a jump in visitor numbers, significantly lifting one of Kenya\u2019s biggest foreign exchange income drivers.\n\nThis was a growth of Sh84.45 billion or 32 per cent jump from the earnings of Sh268.08 billion made a year earlier as the sector continued year-on-year recovery from the slump posted four years ago.\n\nOfficial data from the Tourism Research Institute (TRI) shows that 2.08 million tourists visited the country last year up from 1.54 million in 2022.\n\nLast year\u2019s momentum is, however, likely to be hit by the ongoing countrywide youth-led demonstrations against proposed taxation measures among other grievances.\n\nThe demos, for instance, have led to cancellation of the annual Lewa Safari Marathon which was set to be held last weekend.Last year\u2019s earnings are the highest since the country started tracking and making public annual tourism earnings, with the sector recovering from the impact of the Coronavirus pandemic four years ago.\n\nTourism is one of Kenya\u2019s biggest foreign exchange earners, besides being a key employer with millions of direct and indirect jobs across the hospitality value chain.\n\nData shows that the period between July and September accounted for about 30 percent of the earnings made last year or Sh104.66 billion.\n\nJuly to September has traditionally been the peak season for the tourism sector with millions of tourists drawn to the annual spectacle of the wildebeest migration at the famous Maasai Mara game reserve.\n\nBut despite the record high revenues, the shilling\u2019s woes against major global currencies last year led to a reduction in expenditure as expressed in dollar terms.\n\nThe local unit closed the year at an official exchange rate of 155.47 units to the greenback compared to 123.52 units at the start of last year.\n\n\u201cAverage per capita expenditure in US dollars decreased significantly. This suggests that although more people visited in 2023 compared to 2023, they spent less on average during their visits,\u201d TRI says.\n\n\u201cThis is partly attributed to the sustained depreciation of the shilling against the major currencies during the year.\u201d\n\nLast year\u2019s growth also highlights the impact of a jump in the number of high-level global and continental meetings that the country hosted.\n\nSome of the major global events that Kenya hosted last year included the second session of the United Nations Habitat Assembly held in Nairobi in June and the inaugural Africa Climate Summit in September.\n\nTourism was Kenya\u2019s hardest-hit economic sector four years ago in the wake of the restrictions that were imposed to curb spread of the Coronavirus pandemic.\n\nThe curbs including domestic and international travel, cut annual earnings from the sector to Sh88.56 billion in 2020 which was a 70 per cent drop from Sh296.2 billion made the previous year.",

        "body": "Equity Group CEO James Mwangi has rejected his bonus in a rare move for an industry that rewards its leaders handsomely in the wake of profit growth.\n\nThe banking mogul qualified for a bonus running into the tens of millions but failed to take up the additional pay after some of the lender\u2019s subsidiaries failed to meet their key performance indicators, meaning that their employees did not qualify for a bonus.\n\nThis emerges in a period when banks have posted a surge in profits, triggering huge bonus payouts to their executives.\n\nThe banking industry has remained profitable in recent years and posted a profit before tax of Sh226.3 billion last year, albeit a slowdown from Sh244.1 billion in 2022.\n\nFor instance, the Kenyan subsidiary of the Equity saw its net profit contribution to the group drop to Sh26.7 billion from Sh33.4 billion previously with the unit being bogged down by high non-performing loans.\n\nThe group nevertheless saw a rise in the profit contribution from subsidiaries such as Rwanda and the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC).\n\n\u201cI declined my bonus in sympathy with our subsidiaries which didn\u2019t qualify and I felt I owed them a duty to have helped them to also qualify for the bonus,\u201d Mr Mwangi told shareholders last Wednesday.\n\nIn 2022, he pocketed Sh53 million in bonuses on his way to a total payout of Sh213.6 million in the period.\n\nLast year, Mr Mwangi pocketed Sh158.8 million in total earnings, including a Sh106 million salary, Sh31.8 million in gratuity and Sh4.7 million in non-cash benefits. He is set to earn a further Sh511.2 million from the bank\u2019s dividend distribution off his stake or 127.8 million shares in the lender.\n\nMary Wamae, who recently retired as the executive director, earned a bonus of Sh5.5 million on her way to Sh69 million in total earnings in 2023.\n\nOther members of Equity\u2019s board who serve in a non-executive capacity do not earn salaries or bonuses and are instead compensated through fees and sitting allowances. Equity Group chairman Isaac Macharia said Mr Mwangi\u2019s bonus is usually premised on the performance of the entire group while that of management and staff in subsidiaries is calculated from the performance of each unit.\n\n\u201cThe executive at the group level is compensated on the basis of the group performance and the subsidiaries on the basis of the subsidiary performance. In view of this background, the group reviewed the performance of the Group CEO and he had met the criteria for the bonus,\u201d he noted.\n\n\u201cThe Group CEO felt that one of the major subsidiaries had not met the budget that he had promised the board and he felt that, if employees in this subsidiary were not going to get rewards, it was not in line with his principles to accept a bonus payment.\u201d\n\nMr Mwangi\u2019s remuneration package comprises core fixed elements, including a base salary, pension and other benefits. He is also eligible to participate in the group\u2019s bonus scheme, which is anchored on the achievement of key performance indicators (KPIs) but he does not qualify to earn fees or sitting allowances.\n\nEquity\u2019s board developed a compensation and rewards policy based on a model of \u2018shared prosperity\u2019 which it leverages to attract, develop and retain talent. The first of such rewards was paid out in 2022.\n\nThe rewards are either long or short term, with the former relating to salaries, benefits and bonuses. The long-term rewards include pension and the employee share ownership plan (Esop). Last year Mr Mwangi helped Equity post a Sh41.98 billion net profit, albeit the performance being a 6.4 percent slowdown from 2022 and its provisioning for bad loans more than doubled to Sh35.2 billion.",

        "body": "The Nairobi Securities Exchange (NSE) has shed Sh63.1 billion in investor wealth over the past two weeks, signalling investors\u2019 concern over the impact of anti-government protests on the economy.\n\nThe shilling has also seen slight volatility over the past week on uncertainty over the government\u2019s spending plans following the withdrawal of the Finance Bill 2024, and the prospects of higher borrowing which is likely to keep interest rates elevated in the near term.\n\nPresident William Ruto has failed to appease a spontaneous youth protest movement despite having abandoned plans for tax hikes that triggered the unrest two weeks ago.\n\nNSE data shows that market capitalisation\u2014the measure of investor wealth\u2014 fell to Sh1.706 trillion at close of trading yesterday, from Sh1.769 billion on June 18, the first day of the tax protests.\n\nIn the period, the NSE 20 Share Index has declined by 4.8 percent to 1649.15 points, and the NSE All Share index is down by 3.5 percent to 109.25 points.\n\nThe bourse\u2019s major stocks, including Safaricom (-4.9 percent), Equity Group (-4.6 percent), EABL (-0.9 percent) and KCB Group (-8.8 percent), have all shed value over the past fortnight.\n\nThese stocks are highly exposed to institutional and foreign investors who dominate trading at the NSE, meaning their share price movements tend to closely reflect the prevailing sentiments at the market.\n\n\u201cThe market is correlated with the political temperature in the country as we have seen before, for instance, in March last year when protests caused a slowdown in trading and prices. We are starting to see a similar trend now as the protests continue,\u201d said Ronnie Chokaa, an analyst at AIB AXYS Africa, a city-based investment bank.\n\n\u201cOn the foreign desk, which has had net inflows over the past three months, there is a slowdown in market participation, going down to a low of 12.5 percent on Monday.\u201d\n\nThe souring sentiments in the past two weeks have come in the middle of an otherwise positive period for a bourse that has made double-digit gains in the year-to-date.\n\nSince the turn of the year, market capitalisation has gone up by Sh268 billion or 18.7 percent, while foreign investors turned net buyers in the first half of the year with net inflows of Sh749 million, compared with net outflows of Sh15.41 billion in the first half of 2023.\n\nPresident Ruto has since dropped the proposed tax increases - but the demonstrations have morphed into a nationwide movement against corruption, police brutality and misgovernance.\n\nThe scale of demonstrations were yesterday smaller than last week\u2019s, but chaotic scenes were witnessed in the cities like Nairobi, Nakuru and Mombasa.\n\nDr Ruto has directed the Treasury to come up with ways to cut spending to fill a budget gap left by the withdrawal of the tax plans, and also said more borrowing would be required.\n\nMany businesses remained closed in the Nairobi city centre yesterday, while flow of transport to western Kenya was disrupted after protesters barricaded the Nairobi-Nakuru highway at Kangemi.\n\nThe markets are also reacted to uncertainty over the government\u2019s fiscal plans going forward, especially over the size of the budget deficit.\n\nWhen signing the Appropriations Bill, the President instructed the Treasury to prepare a supplementary budget to cut expenditure by Sh346 billion, to cover for the expected loss of revenue following his withdrawal of the Finance Bill.\n\nIdeally, this would help the government keep its earlier projected budget deficit of Sh597 billion\u2014to be filled by borrowing\u2014 unchanged.\n\nIn a live TV interview on Sunday, Dr Ruto said that the government will borrow Sh1 trillion in the current fiscal year, raising questions over the size of the expected budget cut, if any.\n\n\u201cFor the shilling, uncertainty around the government\u2019s funding gap now that the Finance Bill has been withdrawn is a concern. There\u2019s also a question of whether the country will access the remainder of IMF funding, which is conditional on meeting the revenue measures that were being driven by the Bill,\u201d said Wesley Manambo, an analyst at Standard Investment Bank.\n\n\u201cThe shilling might see volatility until we get clarity on the borrowing plan.\u201d\n\nThe official exchange rate of the Central Bank of Kenya (CBK) shows that last week the shilling was on the back foot against the dollar, depreciating by 0.7 percent to exchange at Sh129.52 to the US currency on Friday from Sh128.55 at the start of the week.\n\nIt regained some ground on the dollar on Monday, appreciating to Sh128.89, before gaining further to trade at Sh128.57 yesterday afternoon.",

        "body": "Since 1895 La Biennale di Venezia (the Venice Biennale) has been the world\u2019s foremost art exhibition and Agnes Waruguru is the only Kenya at this year's show.\n\nHeld every two years in Venice, Italy, the 60th edition of the Biennale runs from April to November. Over 800,000 people visited the exhibition in 2022.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s incredible to be part of such a huge history, where everyone is looking to see what is happening in the contemporary art world,\u201d said Waruguru.\n\nWorks of over 300 international artists are featured in the main Arsenale and Giardini exhibit areas, and more are on display in pavilions around the island.\n\nSixteen African countries are present, with Tanzania, Ethiopia and Senegal participating for the first time.\n\nKenya does not have a national pavilion this year.\n\n\u201cBeing chosen for such a long and important event is really humbling,\u201d said 30-year-old Waruguru.\n\nThe exhibition\u2019s curator, she believes, was making a statement that one does not need a massive career or a great deal of resources to feature at the Biennale. \u201cIt shows that what is most important is dedication to practice.\u201d\n\nThe invitation happened rather quickly for Waruguru. Adriano Pedrosa, the curator of the 2024 Venice Biennale, had been travelling around the world in 2023 conducting studio visits and meeting artists whose practice interested him.\n\nHowever, when he visited Kenya in 2023 Waruguru was at a two-year arts residency at the Rijksakademie van Beeldende Kunsten (National Academy of Fine Arts) in the Netherlands. Fortunately, they met later in the year in Sao Paulo city, Brazil, Pedrosa\u2019s home country and where she was showcasing her textiles at the Videobrazil Biennale.\n\nKenyan artist Agnes Waruguru stands next to her Incomprehensible Weather in the Head installation during the 2024 Biennale exhibition in Vienna in April.

However, she managed to conceptualise and prepare new art pieces in time for the opening.\n\nWaruguru has previously visited the Venice Biennale, but attending the inaugural week in April 2024 as a participating artist was an extraordinary and exciting experience, she said, especially after focusing for months on making the work and how the installation would happen.\n\n\u201cIt is incredible how many people care [about art] and want to participate in these events,\u201d said Waruguru.\n\nWaruguru is known for minimalist paintings on textiles, especially everyday fabrics like cotton. \u201cI want to create a closeness to my work instead of it being intimidating or bravado,\u201d she explained.\n\nHer practice explores ideas of home, time and weaving through places, often drawn from her experiences of living abroad which invoked a sense of displacement and being out of touch with her roots.\n\n\u201cI was interested in how to communicate ordinary life and family, and textiles were an immediate way to talk about this,\u201d she said.\n\nTypically, she uses old bedsheets, kangas, sheer curtains and other household fabrics directly related to Kenya. As part of building rituals around her practice, Waruguru employs organic paints made from hibiscus tea, turmeric, saffron and other natural materials. Her art medium draws from common kitchen ingredients and \u2018memoryscapes\u2019 of childhood such as her mother treating colds with a ginger-turmeric mix.\n\nWaruguru\u2019s installation at the Arsenale venue is called Incomprehensible Weather in the Head. Eight panels of white cloth, between four to eight feet long, hang from the ceiling and occasionally sway in a gentle, calming movement. They are painted with abstract splashes of colour, florals and squiggles, with embroidery, beads and netting.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m happy to put work out there using local materials and beadwork made by local women artisans,\u201d said Waruguru. Behind the art-making, she says, is pride in the material culture of Kenya, its history, its origins \u201cand what\u2019s going on with it.\u201d\n\nHer art explores a particular space and geography but from different perspectives, \u201cknowing that it will be different with each person who interacts with my work.\u201d\n\nA recent inspiration was the book Vagabonds by Nigerian author, Eloghosa Osunde, short stories about different vagrants in Lagos and which inspired the title of her Venice Biennale artwork. Waruguru was struck by how the novel\u2019s characters negotiate the same city through different perceptions and merge spirituality into everyday life.\n\nIncomprehensible Weather in the Head refers to \u201cnavigating many spaces all at once, through many motions, and not quite being able to grasp everything,\u201d she said. The overall theme of the 60th Biennale, Foreigners Everywhere, was particularly meaningful to her, having lived in different countries and traversed through many new spaces.\n\nBorn and raised in Kenya, Waruguru was interested in art as a child but it was not taught as a subject in primary school. Fortunately, an interior designer and friend of her mother noticed her love of drawing.\n\n\u201cShe gave me some art classes and from there I was obsessed with it,\u201d she said, adding that art has saved her life in many ways. \u201cIt keeps me curious, keeps me learning and gives me purpose in a much bigger way than I can express in words.\u201d\n\nHer advice to young people interested in pursuing an art career is, \u201cIf it\u2019s something you really care deeply about, keep at it. Today there are more options for creative careers than there has ever been.\u201d",

        "body": "Dolly Sagwe, a financial wellness coach and the co-founder of Prosper Path runs the numbers. If you are 30 years old now, and want to retire at 40, and you live to 90 years, you still have to finance 50 years of your life.\n\nThe numbers don\u2019t lie, and being a financial accountant, she is right on the money.\n\n\u201cRetirement has moved from what the government says is the retirement age, to what you can comfortably afford at a certain age,\u201d she says.\n\nShe speaks the money language in absolutes\u2014at once an indigenous speaker, but also a translator.\n\nWe are at the Wine and Bar in Nairobi's Loresho, and here she recalls how her mother, a retired banker now 77 years old, bought cryptocurrency at 70.\n\n\u201cShe taught me all I know,\u201d she says.\n\nShe talks about the old and the young, the best preparation for your 70s is in your 20s. Retirement, she seems to say, is wasted on the old the same way youth is wasted on the young.\n\nWhat is one key lesson you\u2019ve learned about money?\n\nIt\u2019s all a mindset game. There are conversations and training you need to acquire a certain mindset that enables you to continue to earn value from your product [in this case, your money]. Without the right mindset, you can easily lose it, even if it is your inheritance.\n\nI have also learned that you need to track how much money you make passively versus actively. Ask yourself: Can I use plant active income somewhere to generate passive income? If you started working at the age of 24, by 34 it should give me different options. Your success should be measured by how much you earn passively.\n\nWhat is the right mindset?\n\nUnderstanding of who you are. The first investment is yourself\u2014what is your value system? And what value do you have? Is the value you give out increasing, or is it stagnant? Essentially, a growth mindset. But also understanding the elements of growth\u2014the relationships and\n\nconversations you have, and the content you consume.\n\nWhat conversations are people currently having on money?\n\nHow to run my second career. Getting into a second career, where one retires from, say, accounting, and goes back to school to study, say, psychology, calls for big expenditure. I invest in the transition because it is what the next 10 years require.\n\nAnd it is not just the older employees. Young people, especially in the gig economy, are working day and night, switching careers to get pay raises, and retiring at 30, so they can live off passive income. The government says the retirement age is 60, but they say no, I will work to earn a certain amount of money, invest it, and do what I want to.\n\nResearch shows that because of advancements in medicine and technology those in their 20s are likely to live until 100. That means if the government puts the retirement age at 60, you still have to finance 40 years of your life. I usually ask young people, \u2018At what age do you want to stop actively working?\u2019 Then I ask them, \u2018How old is your oldest relative?\u2019 If this person died at 103, and you want to retire at 40, what is your plan for 60 years?\n\nFinancial wellness Coach and Co-Founder of Prosper Path Ltd Dolly Sagwe during an interview on May 9, 2024 at the Wine Shop in Loresho, Nairobi. Photo credit: Billy Ogada | Nation Media Group\n\nWhat are the pitfalls you need to avoid in retirement?\n\nMaking large purchases when your income is fixed and low. Some would say, 'I am now retired; let me get the car I have always wanted.' This will eat into your money. The other mistake is getting into businesses you don\u2019t know much about, just because you\u2019ve seen others do it. And lastly, not to stay active and healthy. Before retirement, one is very active; but after retirement, activities reduce, and therefore you have to be intentional about your health.\n\n\n\n\n\nHow does the relationship with money change when one is employed vis-\u00e0-vis when one is retired?\n\nThe assumption is that we retire and things are thick, but some retirees have passive income higher than what they were earning in employment. Those who planned for their retirement have either equal to or greater income than they used to earn, and what they spend on is different. Their expenditure is based on health, wealth, and time. For instance, spending around social engagements and building social capital because retirement is quite lonely.\n\nHow do you remain financially sane in retirement?\n\nDon\u2019t go into ventures you do not understand well. Someone recounted how her mother bought a matatu after retirement, an investment in an industry that she [the mother] knows little about. When you receive a lump sum, don\u2019t start spending or adding expenses to your lifestyle. Save and invest it, and then spend the interest from it.\n\nIs there a popular industry where most retirees invest?\n\nReal estate. It is easy for people that age to translate, \u201cI will build a house, and rent will come.\u201d Besides real estate, women also prefer cash items like mutual funds, where they earn interest. A popular investment vehicle is government bonds.\n\n\n\n\n\nFor men, retirement is a time to sit and relax. For women, it is their time to travel and experience the world. How do the two disparate genders ensure financial harmony in retirement?\n\nThese needs start way before retirement. The hope is that throughout the journey, you start having conversations about money that allow you to build together and do what makes you happy. What does your particular picture of retirement look like? Align the needs that require both of you to grow together, and then allow each of you to live a full life.\n\nWhat do the two different sexes splurge on?\n\nThe Covid pandemic was a hint of retirement. For women, especially in the initial years, expenditure is around the home because guests will start coming\u2014getting the home ready for guests. The sofas, dishes you\u2019ve always wanted, et al. Later, it is travel. They want to go out with their children, husbands, and friends. To see the world.\n\nThe popular imagination is that retirement is about going home, to the village. But the modern retiree has spent most of his/her days in the city. What happens then?\n\nThe key question is what is home vis-\u00e0-vis where you come from? When you have worked in a town for 30 years, where is home? Is it not where you understand and have built networks? This is different from where you come from.\n\nMy mom is 77 and she retired almost 30 years ago, but she is still in the city because, by the time she retired, she had spent more time in the capital city than upcountry. Don\u2019t start a business you know nothing about, similarly, don\u2019t move to a place you know nothing about.\n\nBut if you cannot afford to live in the city, return to where you come from and make it work. Assess your situation.\n\nFinancial wellness Coach and Co-Founder of Prosper Path Ltd Dolly Sagwe during an interview on May 9, 2024 at the Wine Shop in Loresho, Nairobi. Photo credit: Billy Ogada | Nation Media Group\n\nHow has watching your mom's retirement influenced your journey?\n\nShe taught me everything I know about money. She was a banker for over 30 years. In her career, she saw people taking a loan at 10 percent and putting it into government bonds, which gave out 60 percent in interest, making a 50 percent return on investment. She understood early how to play that, and I realised that what you need to work on is the passive income. When bitcoin was new and at $1,700, my mother bought it. She was 70 then. It is all about mindset.\n\nWhat about loneliness in retirement and how does it impact financial decisions since men die almost seven years earlier?\n\nIt is about your social capital. Have people around you. Women are everywhere: in church groups, saccos, chamas, former colleagues meeting for tea, and alumni\u2019s meetings. The lonely ones are easily taken advantage of, especially in relationships. It also boils down to how you were raised. Are they responsible? And the mindset too. You can have plenty of money and you become frustrated.\n\nDependency is rife in retirement, especially when it comes to reverse black tax\u2014where children depend on their parents. How does one safeguard their pension and assets?\n\nIt's unfortunate when it gets there. Train a child as they should grow, and be clear on the child being able to earn and produce. Even if they do take the land after you die, they will still get to a point where they are stuck. It\u2019s about the mindset.\n\nWhat\u2019s the one thing that keeps coming up in retirement?\n\nWhere do I invest? It\u2019s a good question to keep asking experts. The answer to that question depends on the stage of life you are in\u2014are you in real estate, maybe you have enough money to build? You ask the question, but whoever answers should ask, what\u2019s your season? Your season should determine your investments.\n\nHow do you handle succession in old age?\n\nI believe in leaving everything in a trust\u2014the proceeds from the assets to be divided among your successors. It becomes a property in trust, and thus for them, it is to figure out the best way to get as much as possible from said property.\n\nHow does that work?\n\nGo to an expert. Say, 'I have assets, that I want to protect from different people, not necessarily my children'. Then train your children how to produce from said assets and leave instructions on how it shall be distributed.\n\nIf retirement were a currency, what would you attribute to it?",

        "body": "Mwananchi Credit has failed in its bid to lift a court order blocking the microlender from selling two lorries belonging to two traders, which were seized over a disputed loan.\n\nHigh Court judge Kizito Magare upheld the injunction issued by a Milimani magistrate blocking the microlender from selling the two lorries -- a Mercedes truck and a Scania lorry, which were attached in March 2021.\n\nThe court was informed that Peter Kamau Githua and Elizabeth Wanjiku borrowed a loan of Sh2.5 million and charged the lorries as security. The traders said they had repaid Sh3 million but the lender was still demanding more money.\n\nJustice Magare noted that the traders had pleaded and demonstrated that it was likely that the entire debt had been paid.\n\nSecondly, the judge said, Mwananchi Credit is not a mortgagor as the chattel mortgage (the loan used to purchase the vehicles and which served as security of the loan) was not registered, making the attachment void and the amount claimed fictitious.\n\n\u201cThere is also a contention that a sum of Sh9,254,767 is outstanding as per the records held by the appellant (Mwananchi). I am not a student in sorcery and magic, but I am unable to fathom the labyrinth or mathematical permutations and flagrant distortion of figures that caused a sum of Sh2,500,000 to become Sh9,254,767.24 despite payment of three million shillings,\u201d the judge said.\n\nThe court was informed that the repossession of one of the lorries was made in a gangster-like move.\n\n\u201cIf we are to let our microfinance fall into the same school as the shylocks, the court will be missing its duty,\u201d said the judge.\n\nThe microlender moved to the High Court after the lower court blocked the sale arguing that there was a valid claim and that it had been registered.\n\nBut the traders maintained that they had paid all amounts due.\n\nMs Wanjiku said in an affidavit that one of the lorries was involved in an accident but they continued paying the loans.\n\nIn March 2021, the lender attached one of the vehicles and threw out the driver on the transit claiming a balance of Sh9.2 million.",

        "body": "Packaging solutions provider, Shri Krishana Overseas Ltd (Skol), has applied for listing on the Growth Enterprise Market Segment (Gems) of the Nairobi Securities Exchange (NSE), official documents revealed.\n\nGems is a segment for small and medium-sized companies that enables them to raise capital and accelerate their growth within a regulatory environment. The segment offers companies flexible listing requirements in recognition of the company\u2019s growth phase.\n\nFillings show that Nairobi-based Skol targets to enter the market via listing by introduction but subject to approval by the Capital Markets Authority (CMA).\n\nListing by introduction happens when a company takes its existing shares and lists them on an exchange to raise capital at a later date when required.\n\nThe planned listing by Skol is earmarked for August this year in an arrangement where Synesis Capital is the lead transaction advisor while MWC Legal is serving as the legal advisor.\n\nAside from the constraint of not being able to raise capital, listing by introduction is often perceived to have the advantage of providing a company with a much broader base of shareholders, improved liquidity as well as enhanced profiling given the visibility provided by the exchange. Companies that go to market via introduction are, however, able to raise capital further down the road.\n\nOther entities that went to market via introduction include Homeboyz Entertainment, which listed 63.2 million shares in December 2020 and Flame Tree Group which listed in November 2014.\n\nThe application by Skol comes at a time when the government has been at pains to end the listings drought at the NSE.\n\nKenya\u2019s last initial public offering (IPO) was in 2015 when property investment fund ILAM Fahari I-Reit was listed on the NSE after raising Sh3.6 billion.\n\nThe CMA recently published revised rules that would allow more companies to list on the bourse to encourage additional IPOs and reverse a six-year drought in transactions.\n\nAs part of the radical changes, the regulator has struck out an earlier rule that restricted IPO listings to public companies limited by shares and registered under the Companies Act. A public company limited by shares is a legal entity that is separate and distinct from its members and directors or management.\n\nThe regulator also relaxed a rule on the profitability of firms seeking to go public in the main investment market segment. Currently, the law provides that an issuer must have declared profits after tax attributable to shareholders in at least three of the last five completed accounting periods to the date of the offer.",

        "title": "Mystery of 564 tonnes of Russian fertiliser cargo that didn\u2019t reach Kenya",
        "body": "A consignment of 564 tonnes of fertiliser donated to Kenya by Russia last year disappeared in the high seas, new details show, pointing to a possible theft of the agricultural input.\n\nThe missing consignment was part of the 34,400 tonnes of raw fertiliser material Kenya received from Russia during its charm offensive to win the backing of African countries in its deadly battle against Ukraine.\n\nThe raw fertiliser material was expected to be used in tripling the production of ready-to-use product for distribution to farmers across the country, notes Auditor-General Nancy Gathungu in her latest report.\n\nThe public auditor says the missing consignment did not arrive at the port of Mombasa, suggesting it left Russia, but never arrived in Kenya.\n\n\u201cNCPB (National Cereals and Produce Board) received 33,835.9 metric tonnes hence a short landing of 564.1 metric tonnes from the 34,400 metric tonnes of fertiliser raw materials donated from Russia. The cause of the short landing was not explained,\u201d notes Ms Gathungu in an audit on NCPB.\n\nThe 564 tonnes of the missing raw fertiliser would have produced 1,643 tonnes of ready-to-use fertiliser, valued at Sh197 million at the market price of Sh6,000 for a 50kg bag.\n\nThe Russian Embassy in Kenya in August last year noted that the 34,400 tonnes that Moscow donated to Nairobi would produce 100,200 tonnes of the finished product after reformulation.\n\n\u201cMore than 34,000 tonnes of fertiliser donated to Kenya by the Russian Uralchem-Uralkali Group are now being reformulated to produce 100,200 tonnes of fertiliser. This will help Kenya a lot to get a good harvest this year,\u201d the Embassy stated on August 3, following the landing of the input in the country.\n\nUpon reformulation, the fertiliser (34,400 tonnes) would have a Sh12 billion market value. Russia\u2019s donation came amid increasing prices of the input globally.\n\nThe price of fertiliser soared in the wake of Moscow\u2019s full-scale invasion of Ukraine in February 2022, as sanctions imposed on Russia limited availability of natural gas, a main input for nitrogen fertilisers such as ammonia and urea.\n\nThis hit farmers financially while some, especially in Africa, stopped using fertiliser altogether, hampering yields and deepening a food crisis.\n\nSince then fertiliser prices have eased as natural gas prices have come down, but Europe\u2019s fertiliser industry is still struggling as Russian imports take a bigger share of the market.\n\nThe price of a tonne of fertiliser shot to peak at Sh87,510 in 2022 when the Russia-Ukraine war broke, but eased at Sh68,849 last year. Producing 51.9 million tonnes annually, Russia ranks as the third largest fertiliser producer globally, trailing the US which produces above 54 million tonnes, and India with an annual production of 52.6 million tonnes. It is not clear at what point the 564 tonnes of fertiliser donated to Kenya by Russia went missing.\n\nThe fertiliser disappeared in the middle of claims that NCPB distributed fake fertiliser through a subsidy programme. Eighty percent of legislators present in Parliament voted in favour of removal of Agriculture Cabinet Secretary Mithika Linturi for allegedly flouting constitutional provisions on integrity and the prudent use of public resources, according to the motion in the National Assembly.\n\nThe minister is alleged to have approved the \u201cprocurement and distribution of fake fertiliser.\u201d He escaped the impeachment.\n\nYesterday, Mr Linturi did not respond to requests for comment on the whereabouts of the missing fertiliser, which could be applied on between 15,000 and 30,000 acres of land, at the rate of 50kg/acre to 100kg/acre.\n\nThe Auditor-General also notes that the NCPB has not produced a breakdown of costs associated with the raw material of fertiliser, including shipping cost, transportation cost from the port to the granulator and handling costs. The costs would shed light on how much the NCPB spent to have a 50kg bag of the finished product.\n\n\u201cIn the circumstances, the accuracy and completeness of the fertiliser granulation costs and the quantities of the various fertilisers granulated could not be confirmed,\u201d Ms Gathungu says.\n\nThe government continues to maintain the importance of the fertiliser subsidy programme, committing about a fifth of the budget to the agriculture sector to the programme.",

        "body": "The Kenyan government has delayed lowering Nairobi Expressway toll charges despite the falling inflation and strengthening of the shilling against the dollar, boosting the earnings of the Chinese firm that owns the road.\n\nThe Business Daily has established that the Ministry of Roads and Transport is sitting on an advisory from the Kenya National Highways Authority (Kenha) to lower the toll charges that were reviewed upwards on January 1.\n\nThe highways authority, which regulates the expressway operations, reckons that the strengthening of shilling and lower inflation should trigger a drop in the toll charges.\n\n\u201cWe had mentioned the need to reduce toll fees to the PS,\u201d said a top official at Kenha, who sought anonymity given the sensitivity of the matter.\n\n\u201cThe adjustment could be at the CS\u2019s whims and they (the contractor) have no control. It is the CS who can gazette.\u201d\n\nThe current toll charges were based on inflation at 6.85 percent and the shilling at Sh143.75 against the dollar.\n\nThe shilling has since February extended gains against the dollar as Kenya\u2019s settlement of the Eurobond that matured in June calmed investors, pushing the local currency to Sh129.50 from Sh157.32 at the start of the year.\n\nInflation also dropped to a 44-month low of 4.6 percent in June compared to 6.6 percent in December, bringing the cost of living measure to within the State\u2019s target range of 2.5 percent to 7.5 percent.\n\nAfter the adjustment of toll fees in January, motorists driving saloon cars from Mlolongo to Nairobi Westlands saw their user fees increase by 38.9 percent to Sh500 from the rate of Sh360 that had been set earlier in April 2022.\n\nDriving the same vehicle from Westlands to Jomo Kenyatta International Airport (JKIA) costs Sh410, an increase of more than a third from Sh300. The toll for the distance between Museum Hill and the JKIA.\n\nMotorists had hoped for lower rates to be announced from July 1 in line with macro-economic changes.\n\nThe law gives the Cabinet Secretary for Transport the powers to adjust the toll rates downwards if inflation falls and the shilling strengthens as part of the public private partnership (PPP) that the country inked with the Chinese contractor \u2014 Moja Expressway, a subsidiary of China Road and Bridge Construction (CRBC).\n\nOn December 19, Transport Cabinet Secretary Kipchumba Murkomen issued a Kenya Gazette notice announcing the higher charges that took effect on January 1.\n\nThe reluctance to reduce the toll rates has parallels with the rocket-and-feather pricing where upstream changes are adjusted upwards at rocket-speeds while the lower prices come down at the pace of a feather.\n\nMonday, Mr Murkomen did not respond to requests for comments via calls and text messages.\n\nThe State opened a window allowing the Chinese company to adjust the Nairobi Expressway toll charges annually based on inflation in fees that will be paid in dollars. The inaugural toll charges were based on the dollar trading at Sh103.79 and reviewed based on inflation and the rate of the shilling to the dollar. This technically means that the toll charges are dollar-based and will cushion the Chinese operator from exchange rate losses. It has since reviewed the rates upwards twice.\n\nThe Chinese firm is expected to earn an estimated Sh106.8 billion profit for the 27 years it will own the double-decker road.\n\nThe expressway involves a four-lane and six-lane dual carriageway within the existing median of Mombasa Road/Uhuru Highway/Waiyaki Way and 11 interchanges or exits and entry routes that act as toll ramps.\n\nThe toll charges are forecast to generate Sh302.5 billion revenues, which will offer the Chinese firm an annual profit of Sh3.9 billion.\n\nAt Sh3.9 billion, CRBC\u2019s forecast annual earnings from the double-decker road dwarfs the profits of the majority of firms listed on the Nairobi Securities Exchange (NSE) \u2014 underlining the outsized cash the expressway will generate over the 27 years.\n\nToll fees were introduced in the late 1980s but were scrapped in the mid-90s in favour of the roads maintenance levy currently charged at Sh18 per litre of petrol and diesel.\n\nThe return of toll fees is the result of using private investments in State infrastructure to build roads, energy plants and housing, with investors recouping their cash from charging user fees.\n\nKenya is seeking to maintain the pace of spending on new infrastructure with funding from private backers while reducing borrowings and the budget deficit.\n\nThe government is planning for more highways to be constructed through the PPP arrangement, depending on the success of the two.",

        "title": "Ruto\u2019s austerity doublespeak: More debts or spending cuts?",
        "body": "Despite earlier directing the Treasury to cut Kenya\u2019s total spending for the current financial year by Sh346 billion, President William Ruto on Sunday claimed borrowing by the State would increase by Sh1 trillion following the withdrawal of the Finance Bill 2024.\n\n\u201cWe have dropped the Finance Bill. What does that mean? It means we have gone back almost two years. It means that this year, we are going to borrow Sh1 trillion to be able to run our government,\u201d said Dr Ruto.\n\nInterestingly, even after saying that borrowing would increase, from the initial target of Sh597 billion to Sh1 trillion, the President still claimed that the rejected Finance Bill would have huge consequences on certain expenditures the government had lined up.\n\n\u201cIt means we will not confirm the JSS (Junior Secondary School) teachers, 46,000 of them; it means we cannot support the farmers with Sh2 billion for us to make sure that farmers get a fair return of Sh50 per kilo per milk; it means cannot sort out the coffee debt; it means we cannot support the cherry,\u201d said the President.\n\nOther victims of the decision by the government to shelve the finance billion from widespread protests include sugar cane farmers in Mumias, said the head of state. He added that Kenya will continue importing potatoes, to the chagrin of local producers.\n\nAdditionally, in the same interview, President Ruto agreed with the push to scrap the controversial offices of the First Lady as well as those of the spouses of Deputy President Rigathi Gachagua and Prime Cabinet Secretary Musalia Mudavadi.\n\nBut with the conflicting statements, the President has only added more confusion on the budget for the fiscal year starting this month.\n\nThe budget is a balancing act. The expenditure and revenue sides have to balance. On the expenditure side, is the spending by the national government (Executive, Parliament, and Judiciary) and the 47 counties. And on the revenue side, there are taxes, non-tax revenues, grants, and loans.\n\nIf the President increased the borrowing target to Sh1 trillion, the country\u2019s total spending would remain at Sh3.997 trillion. Increasing the borrowing by Sh403 billion to Sh1 trillion would mean a Sh57 billion increase in the size of the budget.\n\nBut on June 28, when President Ruto passed the Appropriations Bill, which he said would \u201cguarantee continuity of government operations, especially in providing critical services,\u201d he had a different perspective. He did not talk of the government increasing borrowing, but he talked of reducing expenditure including by his office.\n\n\u201cI have therefore assented to the Appropriations Bill 2024 and instructed the National Treasury to immediately prepare supplementary estimates to reduce expenditure by the amount of revenue that was expected to be generated by the rejected Finance Bill,\u201d said Ruto in a statement.\n\n\u201cThe reduction in expenditure, amounting to Sh346 billion, will be borne eaquitable by both levels of government: the national and county governments. With respect to the national government, the reduction will be borne by the Executive, the Legislature, the Judiciary, and our constitutional commissions,\u201d added the head of State.\n\nIn his speech, while rejecting the Finance Bill on Wednesday last week, President Ruto had called for expenditure cuts to cover the expected shortfalls in revenues, including allocations to the Executive.\n\nDr Ruto, whose administration has come under pressure for wasteful spending since the anti-tax protests started, directed for implementation of austerity measures that would involve expenditure cuts affecting all levels of government.\n\n\u201cI direct that operational expenditure in the Presidency be reduced to remove allocations for the confidential vote, reduce travel budget, hospitality and purchase of motor vehicles, renovations, and other expenditures,\u201d he said.\n\nThe Finance Bill 2024, which has since been withdrawn following widespread protests that left scores dead, had intended to raise an additional Sh346 billion through various tax measures including the introduction of a 2.5 percent motor vehicle tax, the raising of excise duty on airtime and mobile money transfer fees.\n\nOther tax measures in the condemned Finance Bill include the introduction of value-added tax (VAT) on bread, and increased excise duty on alcoholic beverages, cigarettes, and gambling. There was also a new eco levy that was to be applied on finished imported goods that were deemed harmful to the environment.",

The shift to SHI has since been postponed to October 1, 2024, amid challenges with the digital platform designed to support contributions and registration into the scheme.\n\n\u201cPatients in need of dialysis in various hospitals have been forced to wait since there are a lot of claims that have not been approved because of the slow system. This is also causing a lot of confusion for both the healthcare providers and the patients,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cThe challenges NHIF has created, the small transition time window, and the job security threat faced by employees makes this transition from NHIF to Social Health Authority (SHA) an even more precarious one,\u201d Dr Wala added, noting that stand-alone dialysis centres are particularly affected by the issue as they have no other source of income apart from NHIF reimbursement. The stand-alone centres exclusively deal with renal ailment.\n\nNHIF members are entitled to two dialysis sessions per week, each costing Sh9,500, bringing the total annual payment to an average of Sh960,000.\n\nHealthcare providers have also reported technical problems with the main NHIF service portal, making it difficult to serve patients who now forced to pay cash for healthcare services.

The pre-tax profits earned in the three months to March represent a 12.9 percent increase on the Sh65.1 billion the banks realised over the same period last year.\n\nThe higher sector\u2019s profit also indicates the industry\u2019s resilience and agility to grow income amidst high interest rates and loan defaults.\n\n\u201cQuarterly profit before tax increased by Sh25 billion from Sh48.5 billion in the quarter ended December 2022 to Sh73.5 billion in the quarter ended March 2024. The increase in profitability was mainly attributable to an increase in quarterly income by Sh9.1 billion and a decrease in quarterly expenses by Sh15.9 billion,\u201d CBK indicated.\n\nThe continued rise in profitability has been delivered against the backdrop of a faster drop in total operating expenses as the lenders\u2019 incomes grow at a slower pace.\n\nThe overall drop in banks\u2019 operating expenses has been despite rising costs to secure customer deposits and the requirement for higher provisions from rising loan defaults.\n\nTop banks have nevertheless struggled to cut their overall expenses, pressured by high-interest expenses on customers from their huge deposit holdings and higher loan defaults.\n\nEquity Group for instance saw its first quarter total operating expenses rise to Sh29.6 billion from Sh23.1 billion, as the bank nearly doubled its loan-loss provisions to Sh6 billion from Sh3.4 billion.\n\nThe lender however grew its net profit for the period by 25 percent as its first-quarter income climbed to Sh15.3 billion from Sh12.3 billion previously.\n\nIts peer KCB also struggled with higher expenses in the opening quarter as interest costs hit Sh18 billion from Sh11.5 billion while loan-loss provisions were higher at Sh6.3 billion from Sh4.1 billion.\n\nKCB however posted a quarterly profit of Sh16 billion from Sh9.5 billion previously on higher income.\n\nStanbic Bank Kenya was among the few outliers in the tier I category having trimmed its non-interest related expenses in the quarter to Sh4.7 billion from Sh5.6 billion on lower other expenses.\n\nThe lender however contended with higher interest expenses at Sh5.6 billion from Sh2.4 billion previously.\n\nThe bank posted a 2.7 percent rise in net profit in the quarter to Sh3.9 billion, a marginal change from a Sh3.8 billion net income in March 2023.\n\nThe banking industry's total assets declined by 2.7 percent in the three months to Sh7.5 trillion from Sh7.7 trillion in December, on the decrease of gross loans and advances to customers which fell to Sh4 trillion from Sh4.1 trillion at the end of 2023.\n\n\u201cThe decrease in gross loans was largely witnessed in the manufacturing, personal and household, trade and real estate sectors. The decrease was mainly due to the foreign exchange rate decline. Foreign currency loans dropped from Sh1.2 trillion in December 2023 to Sh990.2 billion in March 2024,\u201d CBK added.\n\nTotal deposits were, however, higher in March at Sh5.8 trillion from Sh5.5 trillion at the end of December even as foreign currency deposits dropped from Sh1.9 trillion to Sh1.6 trillion in the same period.\n\nThe industry\u2019s asset quality meanwhile deteriorated further on rising defaults with the rate of non-performing loans spiking to 15.7 percent, from 14.8 percent at the end of the prior quarter.\n\nBanks' capital and liquidity ratios however remain strong at 18.6 percent and 53.6 percent against a statutory requirement of 14.5 and 20 percent respectively.",

        "body": "A landslide victory for Keir Starmer in the general election on Thursday could hand Britain a stability premium in global markets, boosting the pound, shares and investment in the UK at a time of mounting political turmoil elsewhere, City investors have said.\n\nIn sharp contrast with Conservative party warnings over the dangers of a large Labour majority, analysts in the City of London said the prospect of a resounding mandate for Starmer\u2019s party could secure Britain\u2019s \u201csafe haven\u201d status among investors in an increasingly volatile world.\n\nAfter failing to close the gap in opinion polls during the election campaign, Rishi Sunak made a last-ditch warning that a Starmer \u201csupermajority\u201d would \u201cbankrupt people in every generation\u201d.\n\nHowever, City analysts said a Labour landslide could pave the way for global investment in Britain after years of political and economic uncertainty since the 2016 Brexit referendum under the Tories, which had clouded the prospects for international investors.\n\nHighlighting mounting political instability on both sides of the Atlantic and the meltdown in financial markets triggered by Liz Truss\u2019s mini-budget \u2013 when investors spoke of a \u201cmoron premium\u201d for Britain \u2013 City experts said a clear outcome on Thursday could return Britain to a steadier footing.\n\nNuwan Goonetilleke, the head of shareholder assets at Phoenix Group, which manages more than \u00a3280bn in investments, said money was already pouring into London-listed assets in anticipation of a Labour victory.\n\n\u201cThe UK is really being seen not just as a safe haven, but the safest of havens \u2013 especially in Europe,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cGiven the previous gyrations seen in the markets, whether that\u2019s Liz Truss or the leftwing policies from Jeremy Corbyn\u2019s Labour in 2019, we\u2019re not really seeing any of those wild swings now. That tells you how far the UK has come from Brexit when there were huge unknowns priced-in for the UK.\n\n\u201cWith a Labour majority, it continues to really double down on that promise of economic stability, growth and wealth creation.\u201d\n\nThe pound has rallied against the euro on global currency markets since Emmanuel Macron called snap elections in France in early June, in a development opening the door to a possible far-right victory or hung parliament in one of the EU\u2019s most powerful economies.\n\nJoshua Mahony, chief market analyst at Scope Markets, said: \u201cGiven the political shockwaves being felt around Europe, the prospect of a stable political environment could yet help place the UK economy as a haven for years to come.\u201d\n\nWhile UK government bond yields have remained stable in recent weeks, French borrowing costs have risen sharply. Investors said uncertainty over the outcome of the US presidential election in November had also bolstered UK assets.\n\nAny other result than a clear Labour victory would come as a shock in City dealing rooms after failure by Sunak to close a 20-point gap in opinion polls, which show the Conservatives on track for the party\u2019s worst defeat since at least 1906.\n\nskip past newsletter promotion Sign up to Business Today Free daily newsletter Get set for the working day \u2013 we'll point you to all the business news and analysis you need every morning Enter your email address Sign up Privacy Notice: Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

However, some party insiders believe ditching Corbyn-era policies is important for wooing swing voters and tackling accusations of fiscal incompetence that have clung to the party since the 2008 financial crisis.\n\nThe Labour leader and his chancellor, Rachel Reeves, also argue that restoring political stability after years of Tory infighting \u2013 leading the party to its fourth prime minister since 2016 \u2013 could reinvigorate private investment in Britain, helping to meet his growth ambitions without the need for large tax rises or additional government borrowing.\n\nWhile Sunak has argued \u201cdifficult decisions\u201d taken under his premiership have helped the economy to \u201cturn a corner,\u201d which could enable interest rate cuts from the Bank of England, opinion polls suggest many voters are refusing to give him much credit after 14 years of Tory rule.\n\nMichael Browne, chief investment officer at the asset manager Martin Currie, said Britain\u2019s economy and financial markets could benefit from a period of stability under a Labour government that was \u201cmore moderate and international in tone\u201d.\n\nHe said the situation was comparable to 1997 when UK government bonds and sterling rallied in anticipation of Tony Blair\u2019s landslide victory. \u201cTo quote a well-known campaign slogan from 1997: \u2018Things can only get better.\u2019 With the current backdrop we would like to think so for the UK\u2019s equity assets.\u201d",

The figure for London was \u00a32,652 a month \u2013 almost three times the \u00a3894 asked for in north-east England.\n\nRightmove said the average advertised rent outside London in May was an inflation-busting 7% higher than a year earlier.\n\nIn the capital, meanwhile, an improvement in the balance between supply and demand meant annual rent growth has slowed from its peak of 18% in 2022 to 4% in May this year, still higher than the 2% official consumer prices index (CPI) inflation figure for May.\n\nRightmove called on the next government \u201cto accelerate housebuilding and incentivise landlords to invest in more homes for tenants\u201d to help tackle the supply and demand imbalances and stabilise rental growth.\n\nIt said its analysis showed about 120,000 more rental properties were needed to return rent growth to \u201cmore normal levels\u201d of about 2% a year, based on current demand.\n\nRent rises have been blamed largely on demand greatly outstripping supply, exacerbated by landlords with buy-to-let mortgages trying to pass on sizeable increases in their costs caused by higher interest rates.\n\nIn many areas there were \u201cnowhere near enough homes to satisfy the number of tenants looking to move\u201d, Rightmove said.\n\nScotland was the hardest hit by supply and demand imbalances, the property company said. By contrast, the situation had improved in London owing to fewer tenants looking to move and an increase in available properties to rent.\n\nTim Bannister, Rightmove\u2019s property expert, said: \u201cIt\u2019s easy to forget there was a time before the pandemic where rental price growth was more stable. [Annual] price growth at 7% suggests we are still out of balance.\u201d\n\nHe added: \u201cThe next government should be prioritising an improvement to the planning process, an acceleration of housebuilding, and encouraging more supply into the rental market.\u201d\n\nSeparate figures from Propertymark, a professional body for estate and letting agents, showed there were about nine new applicants registered for each available UK property in May.\n\nIt said that though most of its members reported that rents were continuing to increase or were static, there was some good news for prospective tenants with 18% of firms reporting rents falling against 12% in April.",

        "title": "\u2018We\u2019re in limbo\u2019: Boeing takeover leaves longtime Belfast factory under threat",
        "body": "Much has changed in Belfast since the 1930s. Yet through the second world war, decades of Troubles and the steep decline of heavy industry, the Short Brothers factory has continued to make planes and parts.\n\nYet now a takeover by US planemaker Boeing of the factory\u2019s owner, Spirit AeroSystems, has raised questions over its future. Workers and politicians fear a new ownership structure could lead to steep job cuts at one of Northern Ireland\u2019s main manufacturers, which has about 3,500 employees.\n\nBoeing announced the $4.7bn takeover of Spirit on Monday, as it tries to regain control of parts of its supply chain after safety failures. However, Spirit is also a key supplier to its bitter rival Airbus as it makes wings and fuselage for the small A220 passenger jet. There was little prospect of Boeing supplying its European competitor, so Spirit will hand Airbus its factories in Belfast, France, Morocco and in Kansas and North Carolina in the US.\n\nAlan Perry, senior organiser at the GMB union, which represents workers at the plant, says about 40% of the factory\u2019s revenue comes from making parts for Airbus. (The remainder is from companies such as Bombardier, Rolls-Royce and Honda Aircraft.)\n\n\u201cThe genuine fear is over the other 60%,\u201d he says. \u201cWe\u2019re very much still in limbo. Even if Airbus remains on site, we\u2019re looking at the break-up of the factory.\u201d\n\nBelfast\u2019s industrial icons are in a tough place. The Short Brothers factory\u2019s next-door neighbour, the Harland & Wolff shipyard, was forced to suspend its shares on Monday after failing to file audited accounts on time.\n\nThe Airbus deal gives a strong sign that the Spirit assets it has taken over are not financially attractive: Spirit will pay Airbus $559m (\u00a3442m) to take the operations off its hands before the Boeing merger. Just four years ago, Spirit took over Bombardier\u2019s operations in Northern Ireland, Morocco and Dallas in the US in a \u00a3211m deal.\n\nThe Belfast operation, which still trades under the historical Short Brothers name, has not reported a profit since 2016. In the last decade of published financial results, it has reported cumulative losses of more than $1bn (\u00a3789m) \u2013 including $500m (\u00a3395m) in 2020 when the coronavirus pandemic ravaged the aircraft industry.\n\nIt is a difficult situation for a company that is the world\u2019s oldest aircraft manufacturer. The business traces its history to 1897, when Eustace Short started a company with his brother Oswald to make balloons. Manufacturing first started in Hove, then London, before they switched to aircraft construction after hearing of the Wright brothers\u2019 successful demonstrations of their aircraft. The Shorts obtained the British rights to build copies of the Wright design, setting up the world\u2019s first aeroplane factory on the Isle of Sheppey, Kent, in 1909.\n\nThe move to Belfast came in the 1930s, as the government realised that factories in south-east England would be vulnerable in the imminent war. Since then it has produced aircraft or parts constantly, under government ownership between 1943 and 1989, and then as part of Canada\u2019s Bombardier until Spirit bought it in 2020.\n\nView image in fullscreen English Electric Canberras under construction in the Queen\u2019s Island factory of Short Brothers, Belfast.

Photograph: Chronicle/Alamy\n\nThat long history \u2013 even through the Troubles that roiled the country for decades and stymied the development of the economy in the north of Ireland \u2013 has made it a key source of well-paid employment in a region that lags behind the rest of the UK.\n\nskip past newsletter promotion Sign up to Business Today Free daily newsletter Get set for the working day \u2013 we'll point you to all the business news and analysis you need every morning Enter your email address Sign up Privacy Notice: Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

It is understood that he has been briefed on the situation.\n\nLocal politicians are concerned. Northern Irish economy minister Conor Murphy has said he wanted \u201cto ensure that the future status of the highly skilled workforce is protected\u201d, while Ulster Unionist party finance spokesperson Steve Aiken said the government must make sure work is not moved elsewhere.\n\nFor the workforce, the takeover could mean weeks of uncertainty, with the potential for knock-on economic effects.\n\n\u201cIt is a major employer, not only within the local east Belfast area, but outside that as well,\u201d says Perry. Job losses will have \u201cconsequences not only in the supply chain but in the wider economy\u201d.",

Then, in March 2021, the high court ruled it was the role of regulators and not the courts to address problems caused by sewage dumping.\n\nThe Environmental Law Foundation, supported by the Good Law Project, challenged this decision, arguing that there should be legal options for people directly affected by sewage pollution. But the court of appeal found against them and said the only option for recourse in issues caused by pollution was through the regulator, and that the law did not allow people or companies directly affected to bring private claims against the water companies.\n\nThe case then went to the supreme court, which overturned the previous rulings and found that United Utilities can be held to account for damage caused by discharges.\n\nThe court said the 1991 Water Industry Act does not prevent the company from bringing a claim for nuisance or trespass when a canal is polluted by sewage discharges from United Utilities\u2019 sewers, even if there has been no deliberate misconduct or negligence.\n\nLord Reed and Lord Hodge said: \u201cThe supreme court unanimously allows the canal company\u2019s appeal. It holds that the 1991 act does not prevent the canal company from bringing a claim in nuisance or trespass when the canal is polluted by discharges of foul water from United Utilities\u2019 outfalls, even if there has been no negligence or deliberate misconduct.\u201d\n\nThe Good Law Project\u2019s interim head of legal, Jennine Walker, said: \u201cThis is a sensational victory. It gives us stronger legal tools to turn the tide on the sewage scandal and hold water companies to account, after repeated failures from our toothless and underfunded regulators.\u201d\n\nskip past newsletter promotion Sign up to Down to Earth Free weekly newsletter The planet's most important stories.

We understand and share people\u2019s concerns about the need for change and we have already made an early start on an ambitious proposed \u00a33bn programme to improve over 400 storm overflows across the north-west which would cut spills by 60% over the decade to 2030.

        "title": "M&S increases stocks of smaller womenswear sizes due to higher demand",

It has also enlisted younger names than it has traditionally used in advertising campaigns, such as Sophie Ellis-Bextor and Zawe Ashton.\n\nTie-ups with celebrities such as Sienna Miller, the 42-year-old actor known for her style, have also been important. M&S said 10 was the most popular size in Miller\u2019s range and 32% of items in its spring and summer campaign were in size six to 10.\n\nOn the M&S website, six of the 19 clothing items available in Miller\u2019s collection are sold out in sizes six to 10\n\nPippa Stephens, senior apparel analyst at GlobalData, said M&S\u2019s decision to start stocking outside brands such as Nobody\u2019s Child and Sweaty Betty on its website had helped boost its appeal with younger shoppers while the design of its own-label gear now had \u201cmore fashionable shapes and prints\u201d.\n\nBut she said that it may also be that a larger number of older shoppers were now more trim and \u201cmore aware of exercise and healthy eating\u201d.\n\nMachin has also rejigged M&S\u2019s food stores so that they have greater appeal to young families, with the Essential range of cheaper basics, larger packs and enough items to make it possible to do a full weekly shop.\n\nskip past newsletter promotion Sign up to Business Today Free daily newsletter Get set for the working day \u2013 we'll point you to all the business news and analysis you need every morning Enter your email address Sign up Privacy Notice: Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

        "body": "Britain\u2019s next government has been urged to set up a taskforce to explore the future for the state-owned Post Office including mutualisation \u2013 once victims of the Horizon IT scandal have been financially compensated.\n\nThe Post Office Horizon IT scandal has been described by MPs as one of the biggest miscarriages of justice in recent years and was highlighted by the recent ITV drama Mr Bates vs the Post Office.\n\nThe UK government faces the prospect of paying out multimillion-pound sums to compensate hundreds of post office operators who were wrongly prosecuted by the Post Office and lost money because the Horizon IT system wrongly showed financial shortfalls at their branches. A judge-led public inquiry is now trying to find out what went wrong.\n\nHowever, there are growing questions about the longer-term future of the government-owned Post Office with its 11,500 branches across the UK which reported a \u00a376m loss for the year ended March 2023, down from \u00a3130m in the previous year. It has 5,200 post offices in rural areas that provide vital services such as banking to communities where banks have closed their branches.\n\nNigel Railton, the Post Office chair, recently launched a strategic review looking at the sustainability of the business and its future. \u201cAs part of this work we\u2019re seeking the views of serving postmasters and other stakeholders with an interest in Post Office\u2019s role in communities across the country,\u201d the Post Office said.\n\nEarlier this year, Voice of the Postmaster, which represents about 900 operators, the Communication Workers Union (CWU), which represents Post Office employees, and Co-operatives UK met Kevin Hollinrake, the then Post Office minister, to talk about mutualisation which would lead to the ownership transferring from the state to staff.\n\nRose Marley, the chief executive of Co-operatives UK, the trade body for the UK\u2019s 7,000 independent co-operative businesses, believes the next government should seriously explore the practicalities of mutual options for the Post Office \u2013 once victims have received financial compensation.\n\nShe said: \u201cWe understand that the Post Office network is complex, but if postmasters had enjoyed a genuine stake and a say in how the Post Office operates, it\u2019s pretty clear we wouldn\u2019t be in this mess.\n\n\u201cEvidence also shows that worker and employee-owned businesses are more productive, while community-based co-operatives are more resilient and sustainable as well, so it has to be looked at.\u201d\n\nView image in fullscreen The Post Office has 5,200 branches in rural areas that provide vital services such as banking to local communities. Photograph: Joe Doylem/Alamy\n\nRichard Trinder, the chair of Voice of the Postmaster, said a proposed taskforce could look at the critical challenges faced by Post Office and expand the scope of mutualisation to include not only post office operators and the communities they serve, but also examine issues such as long-term financial liabilities, IT legacy and a revised business model.\n\nTrinder said: \u201cThere has to be a process for redressing victims of the scandal and we have to get the government to contribute and then leave the Post Office clear for a huge restructuring.\u201d\n\nAndy Furey, the assistant secretary of the CWU, said: \u201cWe support the concept of mutualisation as we have in the past. However, before any mutualisation can start then we need a new operating model and all key stakeholders need to play a significant part in running the company. The current management cannot remain in place and there needs to be significant investment.\u201d\n\nskip past newsletter promotion Sign up to Business Today Free daily newsletter Get set for the working day \u2013 we'll point you to all the business news and analysis you need every morning Enter your email address Sign up Privacy Notice: Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

This is why the NFSP is proposing an oversight committee to work with the government as the shareholder, PO as the operator and postmasters as investors in the network. As the PO has a social purpose, this oversight committee should include consumer champions.\u201d\n\nIn 2012, the then coalition government pledged to examine whether the Post Office could become a multi-stakeholder mutual that gave membership to post office operators and their customers, but no further action was taken.\n\nLabour\u2019s election manifesto has pledged to \u201cexplore ways to strengthen the Post Office network\u201d, in consultation with post office operators, trade unions and customers, and support the development of new business models, such as banking hubs, that will help reinvigorate the high street.\n\nThe Liberal Democrats say they would encourage post offices to become community banking and government hubs. The Conservatives say in their manifesto that the Post Office should remain a \u201cvaluable social and economic asset\u201d and delivering that goal \u201crequires a change of culture at the top\u201d. All the main parties have promised to ensure compensation for the victims of the scandal.\n\nRose Marley, the boss of Co-operatives UK, said: \u201cThe compensation is an absolute No 1 priority and rightly so and I think whatever political party gets in power \u2026 doing right by those postmasters is something the public want to see.\u201d\n\n\n\n",

        "body": "Sajid Javid, the former Conservative chancellor of the exchequer, is to become a partner at a London investment firm founded by a trio of his former colleagues at Deutsche Bank.\n\nThe former banker, who held seven ministerial positions in a 15-year political career, confirmed on Tuesday that he was joining Centricus, a private equity and asset manager based in Mayfair. He will start the role on 8 July.\n\nJavid has already earned about \u00a3450,000 as a consultant for the company, which has $42bn (\u00a333bn) of assets under management and invests in everything from football to luxury hotels and 3D printing.\n\nThe company began paying him \u00a325,000 for up to 10 hours of work a month in March 2023, rising to \u00a350,000 a month after he doubled his hours in April this year, according to the register of members\u2019 interests.\n\nHe will join Centricus as a partner after the general election, in a full-time role that will reunite him with the company\u2019s two other partners and co-founders, Nizar Al-Bassam and Dalinc Ariburnu.\n\nJavid worked alongside both men at Deutsche Bank in the years leading up to \u2013 and during \u2013 the global banking crash, before he left to enter politics in 2009.\n\n\u201cThe founders of the firm I know very well, because I used to work with them. Having left parliament and politics I was looking to go back into business and finance and Centricus is a firm I am very pleased to be joining,\u201d said Javid.\n\n\u201cI will in my own time also be carving out time to support good causes. The motivations I had to get into politics to help others have never gone.\u201d\n\nJavid served in the cabinet under three prime ministers as the minister for business, health and culture, as well as home secretary. He resigned as chancellor in February 2020 after Boris Johnson asked him to sack his advisers, and was replaced by Rishi Sunak.\n\nHe rejoined Johnson\u2019s cabinet in June 2021 as health secretary but sensationally quit in July 2022, amid a wave of resignations that ultimately brought down Johnson as prime minister.\n\nCentricus says it focuses its investments in four areas, financial services, technology, infrastructure and media, consumer and entertainment.\n\nThe company is perhaps best known for its work advising the $100bn Vision Fund, a partnership between Japan\u2019s SoftBank and the Saudi Arabian sovereign wealth fund.\n\nCentricus, whose co-founder Al-Bassam holds British and Saudi citizenship according to Companies House filings, reportedly played a big role in securing investment from Riyadh.\n\nThe company\u2019s third co-founder, Michele Faissola, reportedly left the firm after his connections with the Qatari government created tension with the Saudis, amid diplomatic tension between the two Gulf states.\n\nCentricus also worked with European football\u2019s governing body, Uefa, on an alternative proposal to a plan by several large football clubs to create a new Super League to rival the Champions League.\n\nskip past newsletter promotion Sign up to Business Today Free daily newsletter Get set for the working day \u2013 we'll point you to all the business news and analysis you need every morning Enter your email address Sign up Privacy Notice: Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

        "title": "Port infrastructure delays threaten UK\u2019s transition to net zero, industry says",
        "body": "The UK\u2019s transition to net zero is under threat as delays in approving new infrastructure put billions of pounds of investment in offshore wind schemes and other vital upgrades at risk, big ports have said.\n\nThe British Ports Association (BPA) has written to the government and Labour calling for action to clear the backlog of harbour orders, the legislation needed for ports to make infrastructure changes to support offshore wind projects.\n\nThe shadow energy security secretary, Ed Miliband, this week promised Labour will take lead on global efforts to tackle the climate crisis if it wins Thursday\u2019s election.\n\nPort authorities hope to take advantage of the growth of the offshore wind industry \u2013 seen as vital to hitting the UK\u2019s legal commitment to net zero carbon emissions by 2050 \u2013 by upgrading their infrastructure to allow the assembly and maintenance of turbines on site.\n\nSome ports, however, have been waiting for nearly four years for orders to be signed off, more than four times longer than expected, while other schemes have failed to get off the ground over fears the delays will make them unviable.\n\nThe BPA, whose members own and operate 350 ports and facilities, has estimated that it could take nearly nine years to clear all existing orders, while saying that applications are likely to increase in number in the coming years to meet growing demand for offshore wind schemes.\n\nHarbour orders are legislative consents given to ports to construct new infrastructure by the Marine Management Organisation (MMO), a public body.\n\nPorts also require harbour orders to give them new legal powers, enabling them to borrow funds or enter joint ventures, which are essential for the planning of facilities such as upgrades to allow work on turbines or cruise terminals.\n\nThe BPA director of policy and external affairs, Mark Simmonds, said significant port development was needed in the coming years to meet the growing demand for offshore wind, as well as growth in cargo and cruises.\n\n\u201cIt is extremely regrettable that a single point of failure in processing relatively simple consents at a regulator can threaten billions of pounds of port investment and ultimately put our net zero ambitions at risk,\u201d he said.\n\nThe BPA has told Labour that its \u00a31.8bn manifesto pledge to upgrade UK ports could be held back unless immediate action is taken to speed up consents.\n\nThe number of approvals has dropped off significantly, with only four harbour orders receiving the green light in the past two years, compared with nine in 2021.\n\nFalmouth Harbour, which has been waiting almost two years to secure a new order, said the delays were preventing it from progressing plans to tap into floating offshore wind projects in the Celtic Sea.\n\nThe harbour\u2019s chief executive, Miles Carden, said: \u201cThe significant time delays are a massive distraction.\u201d\n\nThe Port of Southampton submitted its application for new powers in June 2020 but has still yet to secure an order, and the Port of Plymouth has been waiting three years for MMO approval. Industry experts believe the body\u2019s lack of legal resources is behind the delays.\n\nAssociated British Ports, the country\u2019s biggest port operator, said the delays were unacceptable and holding up a number of its important operational improvement projects.\n\nskip past newsletter promotion Sign up to Business Today Free daily newsletter Get set for the working day \u2013 we'll point you to all the business news and analysis you need every morning Enter your email address Sign up Privacy Notice: Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

You can\u2019t say to a prospective customer, \u2018yes, we are really interested but we can\u2019t start for another four years because we are waiting for the consent\u2019,\u201d she said.\n\nA spokesperson for the MMO said the application process typically takes about three years.\n\n\u201cThe present volume of applications and the resulting perceived delays were created by the large volume of applications submitted ahead of two price increases to harbour order fees in 2022 and 2023,\u201d the spokesperson said.\n\n\u201cThe processing of these applications is complex and time consuming and the MMO is presently not fully cost recovering for work undertaken for this function.\u201d\n\nThe Department for Transport said it was working with the body and ports to improve the process.",

        "body": "The Labour donor Dale Vince has employed a new legal approach to sue the political blog Guido Fawkes for libel, despite the website being hosted overseas.\n\nVince, who has given millions of pounds to Labour in the run-up to the general election, says the Westminster-focused blog falsely suggested that he supports Hamas, a proscribed terrorist group.\n\nThe green energy entrepreneur is now personally suing the site\u2019s Ireland-based owner Paul Staines. The editor has previously declared that his Irish nationality and his blog being hosted in the US meant that \u201cI don\u2019t have to pay attention to what a British judge orders me to do\u201d.\n\nVince said: \u201cHe believes his \u2018offshore\u2019 structure protects him from being accountable, that he can flout our laws and disregard basic principles \u2026 With this legal action we hope to change that.\u201d\n\nThe green energy businessman has been given permission by an English judge to serve libel papers on Staines via email and post to his home in Ireland. Staines declined to comment.\n\nVince is also seeking a website blocking order, which means that a London-based court could order British internet service providers to block access to specific blogposts. The approach is more commonly used in copyright cases, such as the blocking of illegal Premier League football streams.\n\nThe case hinges on a Guido Fawkes post from March entitled \u201cMulti-million pound donor to Labour party says Hamas are \u2018freedom fighters\u2019\u201d. It consists of an edited clip from a Times Radio interview where Vince is asked: \u201cIs a terrorist attack from Hamas Palestine defending itself?\u201d\n\nVince replies: \u201cI think one man\u2019s terrorist is another man\u2019s freedom fighter, right? That\u2019s how it works.\u201d\n\nThe businessman claims the clip was used to imply that he supported the terrorist acts of Hamas, including \u201cthe mass murder, kidnapping and rape which took place on 7 October\u201d.\n\nThe Daily Mail and GB News have already apologised and paid damages to Vince over similar stories.\n\nVince said in a statement: \u201cSome weeks ago, the Guido Fawkes website published false claims about me which spread quickly amongst rightwing channels and commentators, probably in part due to the imminent election. The intention was clear, to damage my credibility as a person and as a Labour supporter.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve secured numerous retractions with costs and damages already, such as from the Daily Mail and GB News, and for me this is the most important piece of the puzzle, the source. I\u2019m pleased we\u2019ve now been given permission to take action against the editor, Paul Staines.\u201d\n\nThe Guido Fawkes site has previously said it asked Vince \u201cto put on the record unambiguously that he does not think Hamas are freedom fighters\u201d, in which case they \u201cwill be happy to withdraw and/or amend our previous reports accordingly\u201d.\n\nIt added: \u201cThey stated he had previously condemned terrorism on the record. We accept and never claimed otherwise that Mr Vince has previously condemned terrorism, including saying of the specific acts of Hamas terrorism on the weekend of October 7, 2023: \u2018I don\u2019t support what they did.\u2019 We remain baffled therefore why he won\u2019t even through his lawyers confirm that he does not think Hamas are, in the words he used, \u2018freedom fighters\u2019.\u201d\n\nGuido Fawkes has links to the Tory party, having recently appointed the Conservative peer Ross Kempsell as a contributing editor. A former head of Boris Johnson\u2019s Downing Street policy unit, he was given a peerage in Johnson\u2019s resignation honours list.",

        "body": "Keir Starmer has called on a government minister to meet the postal service over concerns that hundreds of people could miss out on casting their vote on polling day after their ballots failed to arrive.\n\nThe Labour leader said the Post Office minister, Kevin Hollinrake, should \u201cget on with the job\u201d of sorting out the problem that is believed to have hit Scotland, where the school holidays have already started, particularly badly.\n\nHollinrake was said to be \u201curgently\u201d investigating a failure to get ballot packs to people in some constituencies in time for polling day. However, Royal Mail sources said on Tuesday that he had not yet raised his concerns.\n\nEarlier, he had suggested Royal Mail should have anticipated extra demand for postal votes during the summer holidays amid fears that some could be left disfranchised because they are already overseas.\n\nRoyal Mail has hit back at criticism, insisting there was \u201cno backlog\u201d before the general election, as experts warned any delay could hit the Conservatives hardest.\n\nHowever, Starmer told reporters on the campaign trail in Derbyshire: \u201cI think [ministers] should actually get on with the job of sorting this out. It\u2019s rather indicative, if it\u2019s true, of the way the government has been run.\n\n\u201cIf you\u2019re in government, and they are in government, at least for the time being, they need to sort it out and get on with sorting it out. We can\u2019t have these people who are entitled to a vote not being able to exercise it.\n\n\u201cSo get on with the job, I\u2019d say, and if the Post Office minister hasn\u2019t met them, do it now in the next hour or two. Seriously, though, I mean, we\u2019re running out of time. It\u2019s not something you can do tomorrow.\u201d\n\nScotland\u2019s first minister, John Swinney, has pushed for a review of the timetable for general elections as a result of the issues with Scottish voters receiving postal ballots.\n\nThe election falls in the first full week of the school summer holidays in most parts of Scotland, with delays in receiving postal votes resulting in some Scots being left without a vote owing to already-planned holidays abroad.\n\nIn a letter to Rishi Sunak, Swinney said the issues had been caused by a combination of the prime minister\u2019s decision to hold the vote on an \u201cunsuitable date\u201d, and the timetable for elections leaving \u201clittle room in it to address issues\u201d which might arise.\n\nA Royal Mail spokesperson said: \u201cWe have no backlog of postal service and, whilst we are not complacent, we remain confident that postal votes handed to us on time will be delivered prior to polling day.\n\nskip past newsletter promotion Sign up to Election Edition Free daily newsletter Make sense of the UK election campaign with Archie Bland's daily briefing, direct to your inbox at 5pm (BST).

        "body": "Tesla\u2019s global sales fell for the second straight quarter despite price cuts and low-interest financing offers, another sign of weakening demand for the company\u2019s products and electric vehicles overall.\n\nThe Austin, Texas, company said on Tuesday that it sold 436,956 vehicles from April through June, down 4.8% from 466,140 sold the same period a year ago. The sales were better than the 436,000 figure that analysts had expected.\n\nDemand for EVs worldwide is slowing, but they\u2019re still growing for most automakers. Tesla, with an aging model lineup and relatively high average selling prices, has struggled more than other manufacturers.\n\nStill, it retained the title of the world\u2019s top-selling electric vehicle maker. For the first half of the year, Tesla sold more than 910,000 vehicles worldwide, handily beating China\u2019s BYD, which sold 726,153.\n\nTesla also sold over 33,000 more vehicles during the second quarter than it produced, which should reduce the company\u2019s inventory on hand at its stores.\n\nTesla gave no explanation for the sales decline. The company will post second-quarter earnings on 23 July. The electric automaker\u2019s sales decline comes as competition is increasing from legacy and startup automakers, which are trying to nibble away at the company\u2019s market share. Most other automakers will report US sales figures later on Tuesday.\n\nNearly all of Tesla\u2019s sales came from the smaller and less-expensive Models 3 and Y, with the company selling only 21,551 of its more expensive models that include the X and S, as well as the new Cybertruck.\n\nThe sales decline came despite Tesla knocking $2,000 off the prices of three of its five models in the US in April. The company cut the prices of the Model Y, Tesla\u2019s most popular model and the top-selling electric vehicle in the US, and also of the Models X and S. Also during the quarter, Tesla knocked roughly a third off the price of its \u201cFull Self Driving\u201d system \u2013 which can\u2019t drive itself and so drivers must remain alert and be ready to intervene.\n\nJessica Caldwell, head of insights for Edmunds.com, said Tesla is having trouble in a market where most early adopters already have EVs, and mainstream buyers are more skeptical that electric cars can meet their needs.\n\nTesla also has a set of unique problems, mainly a model lineup that doesn\u2019t look much different than it did years ago, Caldwell said. With Tesla\u2019s price cuts, used vehicle prices tumbled. Anyone wanting a Tesla can get a far better deal buying a used one, Caldwell said. \u201cIf you\u2019re looking at monthly payments, it\u2019s hard to compete against,\u201d she said.\n\nCaldwell doesn\u2019t see any big catalyst this year that would boost Tesla sales unless gasoline prices spike. The new Cybertruck is being sold only in small numbers, and the rest of the lineup is old. \u201cMost people would be hard pressed to figure out which one is the newer one and which one is the older one,\u201d she said.\n\nWedbush analyst Dan Ives wrote in a note to investors on Tuesday that second-quarter sales were a \u201chuge comeback performance\u201d for Tesla. \u201cIn a nutshell, the worst is in the rearview mirror for Tesla,\u201d he wrote. The company, he wrote, cut 10% to 15% of its workforce to reduce costs and preserve profitability. \u201cIt appears better days are now ahead as the growth story returns,\u201d Ives wrote.\n\nIn its letter to investors in January, Tesla predicted \u201cnotably lower\u201d sales growth this year. Tesla shares had been down more than 40% earlier in the year.",

        "title": "M&S gets it right (finally) on annual meetings. Others should make an effort | Nils Pratley",
        "body": "Archie Norman\u2019s first attempt, a year ago, to reinvent the annual shareholder meeting for the digital age suffered from an enormous error. In designing the event as digital-only \u2013 in other words, in telling shareholders not to turn up in person and to tune in online instead \u2013 the chair of Marks & Spencer abused the well-established principle that even small investors in a listed company must have the right, once a year, to buttonhole the bosses in the flesh. Directors cannot expect to live virtually; the pandemic is over.\n\nHis second effort on Tuesday was vastly improved because it was a genuine hybrid event. Shareholders were free to ignore M&S\u2019s odd advice that they would get \u201cthe best experience\u201d by joining online, and 100-plus individuals were in the room at the company\u2019s headquarters in Paddington, west London. The point, let\u2019s hope, has been made: leave it up to the punters to decide how they wish to participate, which is how M&S behaves in its day job as an \u201comnichannel\u201d retailer.\n\nYet Norman\u2019s push for greater digital access is correct at its core. To catch the attention of private shareholders \u2013 folk who everybody says are vital to the task of reviving interest in public markets \u2013 there must be a video component in the age of Zoom and Teams. Not everybody lives in London, where most meetings happen. M&S\u2019s online audience was many times greater than the one in the building.\n\nOne cannot say the investors were treated to scintillating content, of course. The main mini-revelation in the Q&A was that the company had an astonishing 50,000 ex-employees with discount cards entitling them to 20%-off for life before the chief executive, Stuart Machin, decided the policy was absurdly generous and moved the qualifying employment period from 10 years to 25.\n\nBut shareholders did get to press Norman on his cautious approach to dividends, which seemed to be their main grumble. And he and Machin were obliged to explain why M&S won\u2019t guarantee to pay its contractors, as opposed to its staff, the real living wage. That is worth doing in a public forum.\n\nBroadly speaking, the hybrid format worked. It is possible to quibble with the use of a \u201cshareholder advocate\u201d, in the form of broadcaster Anita Anand, to select the online questions, but a managed process does allow more ground to be covered. And an outsider is arguably better placed than the chair to cut off verbose questioners or the offensive variety (recall the appalling misogynistic comments at Aviva\u2019s meeting a couple of years ago).\n\nOther companies should take note. Attendances at annual company meetings have been in decline for years. Most boardrooms give the impression they wish the events didn\u2019t exist, whether out of fear of protesters or because they regard small investors as irrelevant. Norman is at least trying to stir interest and \u201cstand up for the small shareholder\u201d, which should be applauded.\n\nskip past newsletter promotion Sign up to Business Today Free daily newsletter Get set for the working day \u2013 we'll point you to all the business news and analysis you need every morning Enter your email address Sign up Privacy Notice: Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

        "title": "Labour is putting its plans for Britain in the hands of private finance. It could end badly | Daniela Gabor",
        "body": "The Labour party has a plan for returning to power: it will get BlackRock to rebuild Britain. Its reasoning is straightforward. A cash-strapped government that wants to avoid tax increases or austerity has no choice but to partner with big finance, attracting private investment to rebuild the infrastructure that is crumbling after years of Tory underinvestment. Labour has already done the arithmetic: to mobilise \u00a33 of private capital from institutional investors, you need to offer them \u00a31 in public subsidies. But every time you hear Labour announce such an infrastructure partnership, think of the hidden politics. BlackRock will privatise Britain \u2013 our housing, education, health, nature and green energy \u2013 with our taxpayer money as sweetener.\n\nBlackRock has long peddled the idea of public-private partnerships for infrastructure, climate and development. Yet its political momentum has recently accelerated. When its chair, Larry Fink, the world\u2019s most powerful financier, sat with world leaders at the G7 summit last month, he promised the following: rich countries need growth, infrastructure investment can deliver that growth, but public debt is too high for the state alone to invest the estimated $75tn (\u00a359tn) necessary by 2040. Trillions, however, are available to asset managers who look after our pensions and insurance contributions (BlackRock, the largest of these firms, manages about $10tn, as a shrinking welfare state pushes us \u2013 future pensioners \u2013 into its arms).\n\nIf governments work with big finance, Fink explained, they can unlock these trillions. But to do so, they will need to mint public infrastructure into investable assets that can generate steady returns for investors. Why does BlackRock need the state? Why can\u2019t it deploy trillions without the government\u2019s helping hand? The British public remembers all too well PFIs, the private finance initiatives through which the state ended up paying extortionate amounts to private contractors that designed, built, financed or operated public services such as prisons, schools and hospitals before handing them back to the state, often in poor condition.\n\nBut for big finance, there is more now at stake. In this golden age of infrastructure, financiers plan to own our infrastructure outright and transform it into a source of steady revenue. Since buying Global Infrastructure Partners in January 2024, BlackRock holds about $150bn in infrastructure assets, including US renewable energy companies, wastewater services in France and airports in England and Australia. It plans to expand aggressively, just like other private infrastructure funds. Direct ownership is the main game, but not the only one. Big finance can also invest in infrastructure indirectly, by lending to private infrastructure companies. The key is returns. For this, BlackRock wants the state to \u201cderisk\u201d investments. This financial jargon was included in the 2024 Labour manifesto, and it in essence involves the state stepping in to improve the returns on infrastructure assets.\n\nThe choice here is not merely between public and private financing of public goods, but whether British citizens should tolerate the government handing out public subsidies for privatised infrastructure. Housing is only one example of the areas where these investors can already be glimpsed. Institutional landlords \u2013 the most prominent being Blackstone, the private equity fund \u2013 can acquire residential housing by participating in the privatisation of public housing. After the global financial crisis, the firm also bought up nonperforming mortgages, and since then it has gone on a global shopping spree, snapping up homes across the US and Europe. In the past year, Blackstone bought new rental homes in Britain worth about \u00a31.4bn from the housebuilding company Vistry.\n\nLook behind Blackstone\u2019s returns \u2013 which come from rents and rising house prices \u2013 and you will find the state\u2019s footprint. The government has helped to guarantee and derisk these returns through regulations that favour asset owners over renters, through economic policies that support house price inflation and through the provision of income support \u2013 such as housing benefit \u2013 that allows renters to continue paying their institutional landlords. Although we\u2019re told that partnering with these investors is a means of solving the housing crisis, it often delivers the opposite: higher rents, the displacement of lower-income tenants who are often from minority groups, and less affordable housing. This explains the backlash against institutional landlords, from Copenhagen to Berlin, Dublin and Madrid. Yet such public pressure will only be effective once the state returns to building public housing.\n\nLabour\u2019s strategy raises a bigger set of questions about the type of state we want. Starmer\u2019s vision for government-by-BlackRock reduces the question of state capacity to \u201chow do I get BlackRock to invest in infrastructure assets?\u201d This model involves the state in effect subsidising the privatisation of everyday life. This doesn\u2019t only make it harder to bring public goods back into public ownership; it also allows big finance to tighten the grip on the social contract with citizens, and to become the ultimate arbiter of climate, energy and welfare politics, which will have profound distributional, structural and political consequences.\n\nAlready, BlackRock is betting on becoming a key provider of green energy infrastructure \u2013 though its actual commitment to tackling the climate crisis only extends so far. The firm has lobbied heavily against European proposals to regulate its lending to fossil fuel interests with penalties, and has instead called for voluntary climate commitments. It is aiming to rapidly grow its green energy profits by tapping the government subsidies that will probably be provided through Starmer\u2019s GB Energy, and through the US Inflation Reduction Act.\n\nBut the profits BlackRock will hope to generate through investing in green energy are likely to come at a huge cost. In Britain, we know that the public ownership of green energy is more effective at lowering consumer bills, accelerating the green transition and creating good jobs. The risk is not only that our climate future will be vastly more expensive if actors such as BlackRock are driving it, but that this future will also produce a more unequal society, where citizens equate green measures with unaffordable public services. This may well provide the kindling for authoritarian, far-right fossil-fuel politics that reject the green transition and frame it as an assault on people\u2019s living standards.\n\nInstead, we should plan creatively for a future where extreme climate events necessitate permanent state intervention, from price controls to buffer stocks and public ownership. What\u2019s needed is a big green state. For this, we first need to repair a serious failure of macroeconomic policy imagination that regards the public purse as too small to fund transformative public infrastructure. To do so will require a radical transformation of the state. The state that Rachel Reeves, the likely future chancellor, promises us must break down the neoliberal walls between monetary, fiscal and industrial policy, and scrap low-tax regimes for multinational corporations and individuals with high net worths. It must shrink the power of big finance. This would be a gigantic undertaking, but it is the only realistic one we have.\n\nDaniela Gabor is professor of economics and macrofinance at UWE Bristol",

        "body": "As the traders pack up under the striped awnings of the market stalls in the centre of Alford, east Lincolnshire, Matthew Warner is loading balls of wool from his family shop into the back of his car.\n\nWarner, a father of two, is feeling a serious strain on the family finances from fuel prices and childcare, and his wife cannot work full-time hours as a nurse because of the costs. A longtime Tory voter, the 33-year-old is still undecided on who he will vote for on Thursday, but he says he is now attracted by Nigel Farage\u2019s Reform party, who are making significant inroads in seats like this.\n\nAlford is in the heart of one of the safest Tory constituencies, Louth and Horncastle, but the race is a near-perfect encapsulation of the battle for the soul of the Conservative party.\n\nIts MP is Victoria Atkins, the health secretary, a key figure in the party\u2019s moderate wing and a champion of Rishi Sunak. Her Reform opponent, Sean Matthews, is a retired police officer and was previously a local Tory branch chair who quit the party in protest over its removal of Liz Truss and installation of Sunak.\n\nLike many voters in the market towns of this constituency, Warner says he believes it is time for a change after 14 years, having voted Tory at every election. \u201cNigel is standing out to us more than any other,\u201d he said, though he is dismissive of all the other main parties. However, he says ultimately that he does not trust Reform \u2013 or any other party \u2013 to make a difference to the struggles of ordinary people.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve voted Tory all my life, but they\u2019ve dug their own pit,\u201d said Mick, 60, chatting to a customer in the market square. Reform, he said, \u201care daring to say the things people are thinking\u201d and he calls Starmer\u2019s Labour \u201cdespicable\u201d.\n\nBut Janet Spridgen, 81, sitting in the sunshine outside the hardware store with her dog Nimo, said she would vote Conservative and had a quiet faith there was still a lot of local support for the Tories. \u201cIt has always been Tory here,\u201d she said. \u201cYou only have to look at the houses \u2013 it\u2019s well-to-do, posh houses. They will always vote Tory.\u201d\n\nLouth and Horncastle is a long shot for Reform, although at least one poll has predicted that it will be among a clutch of seats that go to Farage\u2019s party. It is one of England\u2019s largest constituencies, with limited transport connections between its small towns and villages.\n\nAmong Tory candidates in rural, Brexit-leaning seats like this, there are fevered whispers that Reform is considerably exceeding expectations. \u201cIt\u2019s real,\u201d said one Tory strategist. \u201cThere are a lot more seats than we thought that are very close.\u201d\n\nView image in fullscreen Janet Spridgen, 81, with her dog Nimo, believes there is still a lot of support for the Tories. Photograph: Fabio De Paola/The Guardian\n\nSpeaking to the Guardian, Atkins was prepared to take on the argument over Reform\u2019s values and the significant controversy generated by the party \u2013 including anundercover Channel 4 documentary which showed activists using racist and homophobic language.\n\nAtkins said some of the views of Reform party activists \u201cwill horrify local residents \u2026 these views are not the views of my constituents, and they\u2019re not certainly Conservative views. I find what I\u2019ve read of some of the reports in the papers utterly abhorrent, and I don\u2019t think [it] should have any place in our democracy.\n\n\u201cBut what I\u2019m trying to do is focus on what I\u2019ve provided for the constituency in the last nine years, and just the pleasure of working with local residents, securing our schools, our healthcare and protecting our rural way of life.\u201d\n\nAtkins has long been talked about in Tory circles as a future leader from the one-nation wing of the party. Although boundaries have shifted, the seat has been Conservative since 1924 and Atkins has a huge 28,868 majority, taking over 72% of the vote.\n\nWith her profile as health secretary, she is a well-known figure in the constituency, twice stopped by residents in the market town of Louth to wish her luck. She proudly points out a new hipster coffee shop and gelateria, a previously empty shopfront that the owner has restored.\n\nBut her national profile has also meant some voters feel left behind. Louise Davies, 54, a businesswoman and magistrate, said she would not vote for the Conservatives for the first time since 1997 \u2013 she had voted once for Tony Blair\u2019s Labour. Like many residents, she says the area is deprived of critical NHS services. \u201cI waited four months for an appointment, drove 50 minutes to Lincoln and the clinic was closed,\u201d she said.\n\nShe is also concerned about the local high street. \u201cWe have a lot of tourism round here and we ought to be capitalising on what people want \u2013 restaurants, country pubs.\u201d Davies prefers the independent candidate Paul Hugill.\n\nMatthews, exiting the hustings on his way to another event with farmers, said he had decided to join Reform on the day Sunak became PM. \u201cHe was foisted on the party \u2013 and he\u2019s been foisted on the country.\u201d\n\nView image in fullscreen Opposition to pylons is strong in Alford. Photograph: Fabio De Paola/The Guardian\n\nLike many Reform candidates, Matthews has found his social media activity under the spotlight, including climate sceptic posts on X, saying \u201cman-made CO 2 \u201d had \u201cnothing\u201d to do with the climate crisis.\n\nMatthews said that voters were not dissuaded by exposures of controversial posts by him and other candidates. \u201cThey see [the attack] for what it is: a tactic,\u201d he said. \u201cCome Friday night we are going to be celebrating with a lot of seats.\u201d\n\nA key part of Matthews\u2019 campaign is the other major battleground in the constituency and one that will seem obscure in the Westminster bubble \u2013 the installation of new pylons across the Lincolnshire countryside which has sparked mass uproar, a common theme in rural Tory constituencies across the nation.\n\nIn the centre of Louth, Dawn Wrigley, 35, is frustrated with opportunities for younger people and the lack of transport infrastructure. But like many others, she is concerned about the pylons and says it is something that is deeply troubling for her dad, who is likely to vote Reform.\n\n\u201cThere are so many Facebook pages telling us about it \u2013 places where it\u2019s polluting the landscape,\u201d she says. She says she has no plans to vote at all. \u201cThey don\u2019t listen. They lie.\u201d\n\nAtkins\u2019 social media feed is also awash with responses on pylons \u2013 a promised review is in the Tory manifesto \u2013 and has she said she would fight their introduction locally, as well as blocking solar farms. Even the Labour candidate, Jonathan Slater, has pledged he will fight the new pylons. \u201cOur message here is it cannot be done without community consent,\u201d he said.\n\nSlater says the party has been fighting a door-to-door campaign. Though central party efforts are focused on regaining nearby Lincoln and Grimsby, a poll on Tuesday suggested that Labour could be on course to win the seat.\n\n\u201cOn Friday there could be a really significant Labour presence from rural Britain \u2013 we can be a powerful lobby within the PLP \u2013 and that can have huge impact on the government,\u201d Slater said. \u201cMy message to voters has been that Labour will be in power \u2013 I\u2019m the MP who would get things done, whether it\u2019s talking to Wes Streeting about healthcare or Rachel Reeves on investment.\u201d\n\nIn a sidestreet off Louth\u2019s Cornmarket, Janina, 73, says she will vote Labour, but says most people she has spoken to are worried about Labour\u2019s tax plans. \u201cI\u2019m telling them, you\u2019re worried about tax when you can\u2019t get a dentist?\u201d, she adds.",

        "title": "Can AI boom drive Nvidia to a $4tn valuation despite investor doubt?",
        "body": "When Jensen Huang spoke at the Nvidia annual general meeting last week, he made no mention of a share price slide.\n\nThe US chipmaker, buoyed up by its key role in the artificial intelligence boom, had briefly become the world\u2019s most valuable company on 18 June but the crown slipped quickly. Nvidia shed about $550bn (\u00a3434bn) from the $3.4tn (\u00a32.68tn) peak market value it had reached that week, as tech investors, combining profit-taking with doubts about the sustainability of its rocketing growth, applied the brakes.\n\nHuang, however, spoke like the CEO of a business that took 30 days this year to go from a valuation of $2tn to $3tn \u2013 and sees $4tn coming into view.\n\nHe described a forthcoming group of powerful new chips, called Blackwell, as potentially \u201cthe most successful product in our history\u201d and perhaps in the entire history of the computer. He added that the new wave for AI would be automating $50tn of heavy industry, and described what sounded like an endless loop of robotic factories orchestrating robots that \u201cbuild products that are robotic\u201d.\n\nWrapping up, he said: \u201cWe\u2019ve reinvented Nvidia, the computer industry and very likely the world.\u201d\n\nThese are the kinds of words on which a $4tn valuation, and the AI hype cycle, are built. Nvidia shares are inching back, returning above $3tn this week, because it remains the best way to buy shares in the AI boom. Is that enough to propel it to $4tn despite the emergence of investor doubt?\n\nView image in fullscreen \u2018We\u2019ve reinvented Nvidia, the computer industry and very likely the world,\u2019 Jensen Huang has said. Photograph: Chiang Ying-ying/AP\n\nAlvin Nguyen, a senior analyst at the research company Forrester, said \u201conly a collapse of the genAI market\u201d would prevent Nvidia from reaching $4tn at some point \u2013 but whether it got there first ahead of tech rivals was another matter. Currently, Microsoft \u2013 another big player in AI \u2013 and Apple are first and second respectively in terms of market size, with Nvidia third.\n\nIf OpenAI\u2019s next big AI model, GPT-5, and other new models were astonishing, the share price would stay buoyant and could get to $4tn by the end of 2025, said Nguyen. But if they underwhelmed, then the share price could be affected, given its status as a flag-carrier for the technology. A technological breakthrough could result in less computing power being needed to train models, he added, or interest from businesses and consumers in generative AI tools could be less robust than hoped.\n\n\u201cThere is a lot that is unknown and out of Nvidia\u2019s control that could impact their path to $4tn,\u201d said Nguyen. \u201cSuch as disappointment with new models that come out, model improvements that reduce the computational needs, and weaker than expected demand from enterprises and consumers for genAI products.\u201d\n\nPrivate AI research labs such as OpenAI and Anthropic \u2013 the entities behind the ChatGPT and Claude chatbots \u2013 aren\u2019t traded on public markets, leaving vast sums of money floating around in investor accounts with no way to access some of the big hitters in the generative AI frenzy.\n\nBuying shares in multinationals such as Microsoft or Google is already expensive, and only a fraction of an investment is related to the hot new thing. There could be a vast AI boom but if, for example, Google\u2019s search ads business faltered as a result, then the company wouldn\u2019t necessarily be a net winner.\n\nNvidia, by contrast, is selling spades in a gold rush. Despite years of investment in capacity, it continues to sell its top-end chips faster than it can make them. Huge proportions of the investments in frontier AI research flow straight out of the labs and into Nvidia\u2019s coffers, with companies such as Meta committing billions of dollars of spend to secure hundreds of thousands of Nvidia\u2019s GPUs (graphics processing units).\n\nThat type of chip, the company\u2019s specialty, was once sold to enable gamers to experience crisp and smooth graphics in 3D games \u2013 and through a monumental stroke of good luck, turned out to be exactly what cutting-edge researchers needed to build massive AI systems such as GPT-4 or Claude 3.5.\n\nGPUs are able to carry out, at great volume and speed, the complicated calculations that underpin the training and operation of AI tools such as chatbots. So any company wanting to build or operate a generative AI product, such as ChatGPT or Google\u2019s Gemini, needs GPUs. The same goes for deployment of freely available AI models such as Meta\u2019s Llama, which also requires vast amounts of chips as part of its training phase. In the case of systems known as large language models (LLMs), training involves crunching through huge blocks of data. This teaches the LLM to recognise patterns in language and gauge what should be the next word or sentence in response to a chatbot query.\n\nNvidia has never quite cornered the AI chip market, though. Google has always relied on its own chips, which it calls TPUs (for \u201ctensor\u201d, a feature of an AI model), and others want to join it. Meta has developed its Meta Training and Inference Accelerator, Amazon offers its Trainium2 chips to companies using AWS (Amazon Web Services), and Intel has produced the Gaudi 3.\n\nNone of the big rivals compete with Nvidia \u2013 yet \u2013 at the absolute top end. But that\u2019s not the only place where competition is happening. A report from the Information, a tech news site, highlighted the rise of \u201cbatch processing\u201d, offering businesses cheaper access to AI models if they\u2019re OK with waiting for their queries to be run at periods of low demand. That, in turn, allows providers such as OpenAI to buy cheaper, more efficient chips for their datacentres rather than focus all their spending on the fastest possible hardware.\n\nskip past newsletter promotion Sign up to TechScape Free weekly newsletter Alex Hern's weekly dive in to how technology is shaping our lives Enter your email address Sign up Privacy Notice: Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Groq (not to be confused with Elon Musk\u2019s similarly named Grok AI, the launch of which sparked an ongoing trademark dispute) makes chips which can\u2019t be used to train AI at all \u2013 but which run the resulting models blazingly fast. Not to be outdone, the startup Etched, which has just raised $120m, is building a chip that only runs one type of AI model: a \u201ctransformer\u201d, the T in GPT (generative pre-trained transformer).\n\nView image in fullscreen Jensen Huang, the CEO of Nvidia, said the company was \u2018automating $50tn of heavy industry\u2019. Photograph: Justin Sullivan/Getty Images\n\nNvidia doesn\u2019t just need to hold its own in the face of competition, big and small. To hit the next milestone, it needs to thrive. Market fundamentals are out of fashion, but if the company were valued like a traditional, low-growth enterprise, even a $3tn market cap would require it to sell a trillion of its top-end GPUs a year, at a 30% profit margin, forever, one expert noted.\n\nEven if the AI industry grows enough to justify that, Nvidia\u2019s own profit margin may be harder to defend. The company has the chip designs to hold the lead, but the real bottlenecks in its supply chain are the same as for much of the rest of the industry: at the advanced semiconductor foundries, of the sort operated by Taiwan\u2019s TSMC, America\u2019s Intel, China\u2019s SMIC and precious few others around the world. Notably not on that list is Nvidia itself, which is a customer of TSMC. No matter how advanced Nvidia\u2019s chipsets are, if it needs to eat into the rest of TSMC\u2019s order book to match demand, then the profit will inevitably flow that way too.\n\nNeil Wilson, the chief analyst at the brokerage firm Finalto, said the bear case against Nvidia \u2013 market jargon for a sustained fall in share price \u2013 rested on the argument that once the company worked through its order book, it would go back to less frenetic levels of demand.\n\n\u201cAll their customers have been rushing to order the GPUs but they won\u2019t be doing that forever,\u201d said Wilson. \u201cCustomers over-order and then start cancelling. It\u2019s a sweet spot now but it cannot be sustained.\u201d He could see Nvidia getting to $4tn and beyond, but \u201cmaybe not at the current pace\u201d.\n\nJim Reid, Deutsche Bank\u2019s head of global economics and thematic research, published a note this week asking if Nvidia was \u201cthe fastest growing large company of all time?\u201d Pointing out that Nvidia went from $2tn to $3tn in 30 days, Reid said conversely, it had taken Warren Buffett 60 years to get Berkshire Hathaway close to $1tn.\n\nNonetheless, in a world of low productivity \u2013 a measure of economic efficiency \u2013 and declining working age populations and rising government debts, the economic promise of AI was welcome, said Reid.\n\n\u201cIf AI is the catalyst for a fourth Industrial Revolution, that would be very good news,\u201d he wrote. \u201cIf not then markets will ultimately have a big problem.\u201d\n\nMore is at stake than winning a race to $4tn.",
        "summary": "Nvidia shares are inching back, returning above $3tn this week, because it remains the best way to buy shares in the AI boom.\nIs that enough to propel it to $4tn despite the emergence of investor doubt?\nView image in fullscreen \u2018We\u2019ve reinvented Nvidia, the computer industry and very likely the world,\u2019 Jensen Huang has said.\nCurrently, Microsoft \u2013 another big player in AI \u2013 and Apple are first and second respectively in terms of market size, with Nvidia third.\nEven if the AI industry grows enough to justify that, Nvidia\u2019s own profit margin may be harder to defend.",

        "title": "\u2018I totally understand why people are sceptical\u2019: the co-founder of collapsed energy giant Bulb on his new venture",
        "body": "Britain\u2019s fast-changing energy industry may be just the place for reinvention. In the wake of the unprecedented collapse of Bulb Energy, its co-founder, Amit Gudka, is trying to make the best of his next chapter: by plugging into the global battery boom.\n\nSitting in a central London coffee shop, not far from the offices of his new venture, Field Energy, Gudka explains how he has swapped home energy customers for battery projects and why he believes he should be given a second chance.\n\nIt has been almost three years since Bulb Energy became Britain\u2019s biggest gas and electricity supplier to go bust amid a string of more than 20 company collapses \u2013 leaving taxpayers holding what looked to be a \u00a36.5bn bill \u2013 and one year since Gudka successfully raised \u00a3100m for his new battery storage startup.\n\nGudka, 40, says he understands that there may be former Bulb customers who wonder whether he should be running another energy company. Some energy insiders share that scepticism after Bulb\u2019s incredible rise (courting the likes of Boris Johnson on the way) and costly collapse left a deep stain on the energy supply industry.\n\n\u201cI can completely understand that scepticism,\u201d he says. \u201cWhen you set up a second business, you\u2019ve already learned a hell of a lot from the first time around. There are also a lot of learnings to take away from what happened at Bulb to take into a new business as well.\u201d\n\nFor anyone who has built a business and then seen it fail \u2013 there\u2019s a lot of emotional attachment\n\nThe energy entrepreneur left Bulb months before the company\u2019s stratospheric rise came to an abrupt end in the autumn of 2021 as energy market prices soared to record highs, pushing the company into special government administration.\n\nBulb had been the brainchild of co-founders Gudka and Hayden Wood. Gudka \u2013 a gas and electricity trader at Barclays and a DJ who ran the Man Make Music record label and club night \u2013 teamed up with Wood to launch Bulb in 2015 in the wake of a shake-up of the market by energy regulator Ofgem that was designed to encourage competition. Wood courted the limelight, evangelising about how Bulb would disrupt the lumbering energy supply market with slick tech and renewable energy, while Gudka was less public. The pair cashed out \u00a34m each in shares in 2018.\n\nThe collapse sent shockwaves through the industry, casting Bulb\u2019s 1.6 million customers and its 650 staff into uncertainty and threatening to saddle the government with more than \u00a34bn in costs \u2013 a figure that had risen to \u00a36.5bn by November 2022 as wholesale prices soared further amid Russia\u2019s invasion of Ukraine.\n\nAs energy market prices have come down, the cost of the collapse has fallen. It is now expected to be \u201cfiscally neutral\u201d for the government after Octopus Energy was allowed to buy its erstwhile rival with the promise that it would pay the government back almost \u00a33bn of state support.\n\nFor Gudka, the collapse of the company is still a sore point. \u201cIt was hard. It was pretty devastating,\u201d he says, weighing each word carefully. He pauses. \u201cI think anyone who has built a business and then seen it fail \u2013 whether you\u2019re in it, or out of it \u2013 there\u2019s a lot of emotional attachment. It was very sad. And even harder for the employees who were still there.\u201d\n\nGudka had left the company nine months before its coffers ran dry, but he was still on the board of Bulb Energy\u2019s parent company at the time of the administration and was involved in the process of winding the business down. The process is expected to complete this September.\n\n\u201cIn the end, I think it was a good outcome for Bulb\u2019s employees. It was a really great team and I was still in touch with a lot of them after I left,\u201d he says.\n\nThere are no warm words for co-founder Wood. The pair, who built what was once Britain\u2019s fastest growing startup and a darling of senior government figures, have had scant contact beyond Gudka\u2019s attendance at quarterly board meetings.\n\n\u201cThat was the extent of our contact. I see him at industry events and stuff,\u201d he adds. The apparent coolness between the pair has fuelled industry rumour that Gudka\u2019s departure followed a falling-out.\n\nGudka swiftly moved on, alighting on a different corner of the energy market that he saw as ripe for disruption: the growing market for storing renewable energy.\n\nToday, Field, which is registered as Virmati Energy, operates a 20 megawatt-hour (MWh) battery site in Oldham, Greater Manchester, that can provide enough electricity to power more than two-thirds of the town\u2019s households for one hour if called on to do so. It has another 20MWh battery project in Gerrards Cross, south Buckinghamshire, which began operation in April 2024, and a construction pipeline of projects totalling 390MWh. The business is also looking at opportunities in Spain, Italy and Germany.\n\nGudka characterises the move into the booming market for batteries as a return to his longstanding interests in the mechanics of Britain\u2019s energy market.\n\nThe Cambridge University graduate was a keen observer of Britain\u2019s energy generation capacity in his trading job at Barclays for almost seven years before he left to establish Bulb Energy.\n\n\u201cThis brings together a lot of my energy market experience,\u201d he says. \u201cIt had been in my mind for quite a while and by 2020 we had a glimpse at how important it is to scale up this technology.\u201d\n\nskip past newsletter promotion Sign up to Observed Free weekly newsletter Analysis and opinion on the week's news and culture brought to you by the best Observer writers Enter your email address Sign up Privacy Notice: Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

For energy markets, the lockdown restrictions caused a sudden slump in energy demand and meant that the UK\u2019s green electricity supplies threatened to overload the grid. That provided a temporary preview of a grid system run mostly on renewables and the importance of battery technology to store wind and solar power.\n\nGudka says his departure was discussed with Bulb\u2019s board and agreed in October 2020. It was announced the following February, only a few months before a sharp rally in market prices drove its costs well beyond what it could sustain.\n\n\u201cThe intention was to leave with everything on a stable footing,\u201d he says. \u201cThe audit has just been signed off, there was a rolling hedging policy in place, a sizeable team and the fundraising process had been kicked off. There is always risk in business but at this point things felt pretty stable.\u201d\n\nGudka believes that Bulb would have survived the energy crisis \u2013 which also wiped scores of other, smaller suppliers from the market \u2013 if the timing of its final fundraising process had been sooner.\n\n\u201cIf it had started three months earlier, it probably would have been closed by the time the markets really started moving. At that point credit lines were pulled and it was the lack of credit in the end which ultimately led to this outcome,\u201d he says.\n\nTellingly, the top lessons that Gudka says he has taken into his latest company are both financial: strong financial management and very healthy capital headroom.\n\nHe says his first move in setting up his new business, in which he holds a minority stake, was to hire a chief financial officer. He has also raised \u00a3235m in equity and \u00a340m in debt, which he says is more than enough to carry out its plans.\n\nField was first backed by London-based Giant Ventures in 2021. It then raised a \u00a377m round in 2022 \u2013 \u00a330m in equity and \u00a347m in debt. Its equity backers included Plural and LocalGlobe, while the debt facility came from Triple Point Energy Efficiency Infrastructure. Last year, it raised a further \u00a3200m from DIF Capital Partners.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re staying ahead of the curve in terms of capital-raising,\u201d he says.\n\nGudka believes investing in batteries puts him ahead of the curve on Britain\u2019s electricity system overhaul too \u2013 and perhaps even on the road to his own reinvention.\n\nCV\n\nAge 40\n\nFamily Married with children.\n\nEducation Undergraduate in maths at Cambridge University.\n\nPay Undisclosed.\n\nLast holiday Japan.\n\nBiggest regret \u201cYou always wish that you\u2019d started things sooner.\u201d\n\nBest advice he\u2019s been given \u201cSomeone told me to try the 21-day no-complaint challenge. It\u2019s made me much more positive in my daily interactions since.\u201d\n\nPhrase he overuses \u201cIt is what it is.\u201d\n\nHow he relaxes Playing and watching cricket.",

        "body": "Britain\u2019s next government is poised to benefit from easing pressure on household finances after a slowdown in inflation in stores and a fall in fuel prices, but costs remain \u201ctoo expensive\u201d for many families.\n\nFigures from the British Retail Consortium (BRC) show that annual UK shop price inflation cooled last month to 0.2%, down from 0.6% in May \u2013 the slowest pace since October 2021 \u2013 as retailers cut the prices of many of their key products, including butter and coffee.\n\nComing before Thursday\u2019s general election, separate figures from the RAC show that petrol and diesel prices fell for a second straight month in June to ease pressure on families affected by the cost of living crisis. The organisation said, however, that filling up on the forecourt was still \u201ctoo expensive\u201d in England, Wales and Scotland.\n\nAccording to the RAC\u2019s monthly fuel watch, the average price of petrol in the UK at the end of June was just under 145p a litre, down from 148p at the start of the month. Diesel dropped from nearly 154p to about 150p.\n\n\u201cFuel prices are still nowhere near where they should be despite falling for the second consecutive month,\u201d the RAC said. It highlighted the lower cost of filling up in Northern Ireland, where petrol is 4.5p a litre cheaper on average and diesel 8p cheaper than in the rest of the UK.\n\nThe RAC\u2019s head of policy, Simon Williams, said: \u201cWhile it\u2019s good news prices at the pumps have fallen for the second month in a row, this also leaves a bad taste in the mouth because we know drivers in Great Britain are continuing to get a raw deal as both petrol and diesel are still much more expensive than in Northern Ireland.\u201d\n\nHe said prices at forecourts owned and run by Shell and BP were the most expensive, highlighting Competition and Markets Authority data showing that Shell-owned sites were the most expensive in the UK.\n\n\u201cWe remain baffled how the very same fuel can be sold for such vastly different prices by the biggest retailers, whether they\u2019re run by supermarkets or the world\u2019s largest oil companies,\u201d he said.\n\nRishi Sunak has made lower inflation the cornerstone of the Conservatives\u2019 general election campaign after a return in the official headline rate to the Bank of England\u2019s target of 2% in May, down from a peak of 11.1% in October 2022.\n\nThe shadow chancellor, Rachel Reeves, however, has said pressure on household finances remains \u201cacute\u201d as average prices remain significantly higher than before the cost of living crisis took hold.\n\nskip past newsletter promotion Sign up to Business Today Free daily newsletter Get set for the working day \u2013 we'll point you to all the business news and analysis you need every morning Enter your email address Sign up Privacy Notice: Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

The figures suggest average prices in UK shops are continuing to rise, albeit at a slower pace than in previous months.\n\nThe chief executive of the BRC, Helen Dickinson, said retailers had, however, cut the prices of some key products including butter and coffee. Non-food prices were also in deflation \u2013 meaning average prices are falling compared with a year earlier \u2013 as shops tried to boost their sales by discounting products.\n\n\u201cThis was particularly true for TVs with great deals to capitalise on the Euros fever,\u201d she said. \u201cWhoever wins Thursday\u2019s election will benefit from the work of retailers to cut their costs and prices, easing the cost of living for millions of households.\u201d",

        "body": "House prices in the UK remain unaffordable for many households despite wages rising above inflation for the typical earner, Nationwide has said.\n\nBritain\u2019s largest building society said prices had risen slightly in June amid the impact of higher mortgage costs, with a 0.2% month-on-month increase.\n\nOn an annual basis house price growth accelerated from 1.3% in May to 1.5% in June, leaving prices about 3% below the record high set in summer 2022. The average price of a UK home was \u00a3266,064 in June, Nationwide said.\n\nHouse prices in the UK fell last year as households came under pressure from 14 consecutive interest rate rises from the Bank of England, but they remain at historically high levels relative to earnings. Prices returned to growth earlier this year, but activity has been constrained by persistently higher borrowing costs and prices remaining unaffordable for many households.\n\nRobert Gardner, the Nationwide chief economist, said mortgage rates were still well above the record lows of 2021 and that rising costs had outstripped the benefit from stronger levels of average pay growth in recent months.\n\n\u201cAs a result, housing affordability is still stretched. Today, a borrower earning the average UK income buying a typical first-time buyer property with a 20% deposit would have a monthly mortgage payment equivalent to 37% of take-home pay \u2013 well above the long run average of 30%,\u201d he said.\n\nSeparate figures from the Bank of England revealed a slowdown in housing market activity in May as people borrowed \u00a31.2bn of mortgage debt, down from \u00a32.2bn in April. Net mortgage approvals for house purchases also fell slightly from 60,800 in April to 60,000 in May.\n\nOfficial figures show average annual wage growth in the three months to April was 6%, above the rate of inflation, which fell back to the Bank\u2019s target of 2% in May after reaching a peak of 11% in October 2022, the highest level in four decades.\n\nskip past newsletter promotion Sign up to Business Today Free daily newsletter Get set for the working day \u2013 we'll point you to all the business news and analysis you need every morning Enter your email address Sign up Privacy Notice: Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

        "title": "The no-deposit mortgage that lets tenants buy the home they live in \u2026 with a gift from the landlord",
        "body": "A growing number of people are taking out a little-known type of mortgage that allows them to buy a property without having to put down a deposit.\n\nSeveral lenders offer \u201cconcessionary purchase\u201d mortgages, meaning that a tenant can buy the property they are living in from their landlord at a marked-down price.\n\nThere has been a rise in take-up as tax changes on buy-to-lets and much higher mortgage costs prompt more landlords to sell. Now TSB, one of the lenders that offers these deals, reports significant demand.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s gone from a product we never really spoke about to something that regularly comes up. We\u2019re doing a steady number \u2026 there\u2019s a demand for it,\u201d says Roland McCormack, TSB\u2019s mortgage distribution director.\n\nFor tenants given the chance to buy this way, it may be the best financial deal they are ever offered. And while it involves a landlord agreeing to take a lower price than they could potentially get on the open market, it also means a quicker, smoother sale \u2013 and no estate agent fees.\n\nHow do they work, and who can get them?\n\nQuite a few banks and building societies offer mortgages that allow someone to buy a family member\u2019s property for less than its market value \u2013 for example, when a parent wants to help their child on to the property ladder, so agrees to sell at a discounted price.\n\nHowever, some lenders also accept mortgage applications from sitting tenants wanting to buy from their landlord, and from employees wanting to buy from their employer.\n\nThese are basically standard mortgages, but with one or two key differences.\n\nCrucially, the seller typically has to agree to sell for at least 10% below its market value. Many landlords might find that hard to swallow. However, the seller will enjoy cost savings that, it is claimed, could offset about half of that loss.\n\nIn many, but not all, cases, the tenant does not need to put down a penny of their own cash as a deposit \u2013 in mortgage-speak, the landlord is giving the tenant \u201ca gift of equity\u201d, which is taken by the lender as a deposit. Assuming a 10% discount, the buyer would then take out a 90% loan-to-value (LTV) mortgage.\n\nHowever, the buyer may wish to put in some of their own money to boost the deposit and bring down the LTV, which hopefully will give them access to a better rate.\n\nThe discount has to be a gift, not a loan, with no conditions attached.\n\nThese deals are something of a niche product but are clearly enjoying a bit of a moment.\n\nView image in fullscreen Landlords who sell via a concessionary purchase do lose out on price, but benefit from a smooth, quick sale without estate agents\u2019 fees or the costs of having an empty property for months. Photograph: Andy Rain/EPA\n\nWhich banks or lenders offer these deals?\n\nIn addition to TSB, there\u2019s the likes of Halifax, Nationwide, Barclays and NatWest.\n\nTerms can vary. For example, TSB and Nationwide are among those that explicitly state they do not require the tenant to put down any deposit. However, both Barclays and NatWest say buyers need to contribute their own deposit on top \u2013 a minimum of 5%.\n\nTypically, this is going to be an arrangement between a private landlord and tenant, though TSB and Halifax say the landlord can also be a local authority, indicating this could be an option for a council tenant where the right to buy is not available.\n\nWhy would a landlord agree to do this?\n\nA combination of a less favourable tax regime for buy-to-let properties, and a string of mortgage-rate rises over the last two years, has led to many landlords baling out of the rented sector or evaluating their options. So there will definitely be some who are keen to sell.\n\nBy selling to their tenant, they avoid paying the costs normally associated with a house sale \u2013 notably estate agent fees, which can vary from less than 1% to as much as 3.5%. It also means they will not be paying perhaps several months of mortgage interest while the property is empty and on the market.\n\nMcCormack reckons those two savings will in effect cut the amount the landlord is giving away from 10% to more like 5%. \u201cThey are still out of pocket, but it\u2019s a much smoother transaction for them,\u201d he adds. \u201cThey don\u2019t have to have a tenant move out of the property, do it all up and then wait several months \u2013 all while not receiving rent.\u201d\n\nOn top of that, the landlord does not have to bother finding a buyer and dealing with lots of inquiries about the property.\n\nOne of the key benefits for a landlord would be the speed of a sale, \u201cand, potentially, they don\u2019t want to do a disservice to a tenant who has perhaps been living there for a long time\u201d, says David Hollingworth of broker L&C Mortgages. If the landlord has made a decent amount from the property and has a good relationship with the tenant, they may like the idea of helping them become a homeowner.\n\nIs this as good as it seems for the buyer?\n\nYes: they typically don\u2019t need a deposit and are saving at least 10% on the market value.\n\nAlso, they know the property and the area, says McCormack. \u201cThey know the heating works, they know the neighbourhood, they know the glitches and they know the neighbours.\u201d\n\nA landlord\u2019s \u00a331,000 \u2018gift\u2019\n\nFirst-time buyers Graham and Lisa received a huge financial helping hand to get on the housing ladder in the form of a \u00a331,000 equity \u201cgift\u201d from their landlord to buy the home they had been living in for over three years.\n\nThey started renting the two-bedroom bungalow near Cheltenham in late 2019, and then, early last year, the landlord said he was looking to sell.\n\nThe couple, who had been thinking of trying to buy the property, spoke to a mortgage adviser who suggested a TSB concessionary purchase mortgage.\n\nThe couple made sure the terms were OK with the landlord \u2013 in particular, the 10% discount. He agreed, and they went ahead.\n\nThe house had a market value of \u00a3310,000. Once the \u00a331,000 discount was applied, they required a \u00a3279,000 loan.\n\n\u201cWe put in another \u00a320K, so the deposit was \u00a351,000,\u201d says Graham, 32. That meant they were able to take out a mortgage (a five-year fix) for \u00a3259,000.\n\n\u201cThis is probably the easiest way we could have got on the ladder,\u201d says Graham, a production engineer working in aerospace. The couple did not need to move or compete with other buyers or \u201cdeal with any of the really difficult parts of housebuying\u201d.\n\nThey are paying more monthly than they were when they were renting. \u201cHowever, it\u2019s into a mortgage, and the property is ours. Of course, we\u2019ve got \u00a330K of equity we did not pay for,\u201d says Graham.",

        "body": "Last July, I paid AXS \u00a32,649 for four tickets for the Taylor Swift concert in Liverpool this month as a treat for my daughters. When they arrived, they found their view of the stage completely blocked by a tent and large items of technical equipment shrouded in black plastic.\n\nThey asked to be moved and were put in the very back corner next to fans who had paid a fraction of what I had.\n\nAXS appears to be ignoring my email suggesting they sold tickets that were not as described.\n\nST, Gloucester\n\nThe premium package you purchased promised \u201cunforgettable seats\u201d along with branded merchandise. A restricted view was not mentioned, either, on the sales page or the confirmation. \u201cUnforgettable\u201d, at least, was an accurate description. Your daughters say they will never forget the disappointment.\n\nAE of Faversham, Kent fears her Taylor Swift tickets in August will be similarly memorable, for she too has booked VIP seats, paying over \u00a31,320 for two.\n\nFeedback and photos from friends and social media suggest that she has also invested in a view of a large tent and bulky sound equipment.\n\n\u201cFrom the row we\u2019ve been allocated, it looks as though we\u2019ll just about be able to see the screen but nothing else,\u201d she writes. \u201cI\u2019ve asked AXS for the VIP tickets we were sold \u2013 with a view of the stage \u2013 but have had no response and neither have friends who have already attended the concert and found they could see nothing.\u201d\n\nOther furious fans have reported on social media that their premium seats were barricaded behind stage equipment. The tent that blocks the view, ironically, is to lodge celebrity guests who probably get their tickets gratis.\n\nSeats with a restricted view are supposed to be advertised as such, and priced accordingly. The venues are vast, and the stage viewed from the seated areas is always going to be in the far distance. But it\u2019s an outrage fans have seemingly been misled into paying for a first-class experience when the stage configuration prevents them seeing it at all.\n\nNeither AXS nor its sister \u00adcompany AEG Presents, the organiser of the tour, responded to my request for comment. They don\u2019t need to. Performances are a sellout, with fans prepared to pay any money to get a seat.\n\nST\u2019s next option is to make a claim for breach of contract and statutory rights via the small claims court, now Money Claim Online. The Consumer Rights Act states that purchases must be as described and fit for purpose, and ST can claim the difference between the price she paid, and the price of the seats her daughters ended up in. According to consumer lawyer Gary Rycroft, she can also try claiming for damages.\n\nAE\u2019s situation is less clear-cut, he says, since she has not yet attended the concert. \u201cIf the retailer offers a full refund, the logic is she will either have to agree, or not,\u201d he says. \u201cA cynical retailer may take a view that Swifty is in such demand they can easily sell on a refunded ticket at a similar price with full disclosure of the restricted view.\u201d\n\nOn the night, you could demand to be moved, citing the Consumer Rights Act, and take photos of the blocked view to support any claim.\n\nEmail your.problems@observer.co.uk.

It expects bills to remain at a similar level into the first months of 2025.\n\nAnalysts at the Energy and Climate Intelligence Unit (ECIU), a thinktank, have warned that energy prices are likely to remain significantly higher than they were before the Russian invasion for the rest of the decade.\n\nThe conflict has ended Europe\u2019s gas pipeline imports from Russia, which was once its largest source of gas. This has left European markets more exposed to global energy price fluctuations as it relies more on imports from the US and the Middle East.\n\nEurope\u2019s gas market prices were lower in the early months of the year after a relatively mild winter, allowing energy bills to fall this summer. But markets have started to climb again, in part due to stronger gas demand from Asian economies, which will spell higher bills again this winter.\n\nSimon Cran-McGreehin, the head of analysis at the ECIU, said: \u201cThe UK\u2019s high dependence on gas for electricity generation and heating has cost bill payers \u00a32,000 so far during the gas crisis, and the economy as a whole tens of billions of pounds.\u201d\n\nskip past newsletter promotion Sign up to Business Today Free daily newsletter Get set for the working day \u2013 we'll point you to all the business news and analysis you need every morning Enter your email address Sign up Privacy Notice: Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

        "body": "People who look after family members free of charge are taking a huge hit to their finances which could continue into their retirement as they find themselves unable to balance paid work with their caring commitments.\n\nRecent analysis of official figures by the financial firm Just Retirement found seven in 10 people who were receiving carer\u2019s allowance were not in paid work, and missing out on earnings and private pension contributions.\n\nAndresearch last year by the charity Carers UK found that 40% of those providing high levels of care for an ill, elderly or disabled relative or friend had left their employment, while 22% had reduced their working hours.\n\n\u201cToo often for unpaid carers in work, the immense stresses and challenges of the role with little support can mean having to reduce working hours or come out of the workplace altogether,\u201d says Helen Walker, the chief executive of Carers UK. \u201cThis can have a significant impact on household finances, exacerbated by the current cost of living crisis.\u201d\n\nView image in fullscreen An earnings limit means you do not qualify for carer\u2019s allowance if you earn more than \u00a3151 a week. Photograph: Rosemary Roberts/Alamy\n\nWith just days to go until the election, the party that looks most likely to take power has said very little about what it would do to help the UK\u2019s army of unpaid carers. The Labour manifesto does not include a single mention of the word \u201ccarer\u201d. The Conservative manifesto does include a few brief mentions. Only the Liberal Democrats have put forward substantial proposals for better support.\n\nCarer\u2019s allowance is now worth \u00a381.90 a week and is available to people who provide at least 35 hours a week of care to a disabled person.\n\nCarers UK has been conducting an annual survey for several years, each time asking people about the impact of their role on their finances. Last year, it found 75% of those receiving carer\u2019s allowance were struggling with cost-of-living pressures, with almost half cutting back on essentials including food and heating. The proportion saying that they were struggling to make ends meet had risen to 45%, from 39% in 2022.\n\nThe survey found that 72% were worried about the financial hit from expenses linked to caring, such as petrol for hospital visits, heating and specific dietary requirements.\n\nThose who were employed worked in low-paid jobs as a result of the strict rules around carer\u2019s allowance. An earnings limit means you do not qualify if you earn more than \u00a3151 a week \u2013 after that, you lose the entire benefit. The Guardian has revealed that carers who have inadvertently earned more have been taken to court by the Department for Work and Pensions.\n\nCarers UK and Just Retirement say that these rules make it hard for people to stay in paid work.\n\nView image in fullscreen A recent survey found 75% of those receiving carer\u2019s allowance were struggling with the cost of living. Photograph: Westend61/Getty Images\n\n\u201cRemoving unnecessary pressures and ensuring those who can, and want to, remain in paid work is essential,\u201d Walker says.\n\nShe says the low level of the payments doesn\u2019t recognise what carers do, \u201cand there are clear problems in the way that it\u2019s delivered, making even small amounts of work challenging. Raising the earnings limit is something that would help more carers to stay in paid work and help avoid some devastating overpayments.\u201d\n\nStephen Lowe from Just Retirement says carer\u2019s allowance was never intended to be a \u201cwage\u201d or payment for caring services. \u201cHowever, if the rules are stopping or limiting people from taking up employment and earnings opportunities that are available to them, then we have to question whether it is fit for purpose.\u201d\n\nHe warns that if people restrict their work or give it up entirely to provide care, \u201cthat loss of income and other work benefits such as employer pension contributions is likely to have an impact on their lives for decades to come, as well as on the businesses who lose key staff.\u201d\n\nAmong proposals in the party manifestos for next week\u2019s general election are a pledge by the Lib Dems to increase carer\u2019s allowance by \u00a320 a week and to introduce a new earnings taper of \u00a3183, after which carers would start to lose some of their allowance. Labour has previously said it would review the system but included no details in its election pledges.\n\nWalker says that without better support for working carers, the problems they face will show no sign of abating.\n\n\u201cThe last decade has seen a significant rise in the number of hours of unpaid care being provided and a reduction in social care available,\u201d she says. \u201cOur recent YouGov research revealed that 62% of UK adults \u2013 the equivalent of 10 million current or former unpaid carers \u2013 said they have had no choice about taking on an unpaid caring role.\u201d",

This could be when their course officially ends, or the day after they abandon it or get dismissed from their studies.\n\n\u201cFor example, if a student\u2019s final term ends on 10 June, they will become liable for council tax from 11 June,\u201d she says.\n\nShe adds: \u201cThis only applies to final-year students; students don\u2019t have to pay council tax during the summer holidays between years of study.\u201d\n\nManchester city council has already sent out letters billing graduating students for days since term ended. Other councils are less proactive.\n\nA spokesperson for Council Tax Advisors said: \u201cIt\u2019s advisable for students to check with their local council for precise details, as there can be variations in how councils handle the end of term exemptions and the start of council tax liability.\u201d\n\nCouncil tax bills are based on a property\u2019s value so how much students could become liable for depends on the property they are renting.\n\nAccording to Gov.uk, from 2024 to 2025, the average bill for a band D property (priced between \u00a368,001 and \u00a388,000 in value on 1 April 1991) will be \u00a32,171 a year. This is about \u00a3181 a month \u2013 a lot when a third of students live off less than \u00a350.\n\nStudents who receive a letter or due payment notice should take action so it does not result in a debt.\n\nThere can be serious consequences for council tax arrears, including legal action or a visit from a bailiff.\n\nStudents who can prove they are no longer living in the property may be able to get an exemption at their council\u2019s discretion.\n\nHowever, for the most part, those in this position will need to pay.\n\nIt is important for students to continue checking post, especially as their housemates begin to move out of their rented accommodation.",

        "body": "Inflation across the eurozone slowed to 2.5% in June despite lingering pressure on households from price increases in the service sector, leaving the European Central Bank on track to keep interest rates on hold this month.\n\nAnnual inflation in consumer prices across the 20-country bloc eased from 2.6% in May, according to a flash estimate from the EU statistical agency Eurostat, matching financial market expectations.\n\nHowever, core inflation \u2013 which strips out food, energy, alcohol and tobacco \u2013 remained unchanged at 2.9%, marginally higher than predicted by economists in a reflection of stubborn inflationary pressures.\n\nAnalysts said the figures were unlikely to encourage the ECB to cut interest rates again at its next policy meeting on 18 July, after it became the first big global central bank to reduce official borrowing costs, in June.\n\n\u201cNothing in these figures would make the ECB cut again in July, and we think it\u2019ll be eagerly awaiting data over the summer before seriously debating a next rate cut in September,\u201d said Bert Colijn, the senior eurozone economist at the Dutch bank ING.\n\n\u201cThe summer is set to be relatively boring [for the ECB]. It can afford not to carry out another rate cut based on the too-high core inflation reading and labour market strength, and will likely just await incoming data on wages, inflation and growth. It can also see how market turmoil around the French elections plays out.\u201d\n\nIn its flash estimate for June, Eurostat figures showed services had the highest annual inflation rate at 4.1%, a stable rate compared with May. Annual price growth for food, alcohol and tobacco slowed from 2.6% in May to 2.5%.\n\nRiccardo Marcelli Fabiani, a senior economist at the consultancy Oxford Economics, said: \u201cInflation resumed its descent after it had been temporarily interrupted in May, and it will continue to fall as inflationary pressures wane thanks to easing wage growth, lower energy prices and normalised price expectations. But core inflation remaining stable reminds us that the disinflationary process will be bumpy.\u201d\n\nThe ECB cut its main deposit rate last month to 3.75% from a record high of 4%, putting it ahead of the US Federal Reserve and the Bank of England, which have yet to cut interest rates. It was the first time that the main eurozone interest rate had been reduced in almost five years.\n\nHowever, the central bank\u2019s president, Christine Lagarde, said on Monday that benign economic developments suggest that further interest rate cuts are not urgent, with a robust labour market and resilient wage growth.\n\nskip past newsletter promotion Sign up to Business Today Free daily newsletter Get set for the working day \u2013 we'll point you to all the business news and analysis you need every morning Enter your email address Sign up Privacy Notice: Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

        "summary": "Inflation across the eurozone slowed to 2.5% in June despite lingering pressure on households from price increases in the service sector, leaving the European Central Bank on track to keep interest rates on hold this month.\nAnalysts said the figures were unlikely to encourage the ECB to cut interest rates again at its next policy meeting on 18 July, after it became the first big global central bank to reduce official borrowing costs, in June.\nIt can afford not to carry out another rate cut based on the too-high core inflation reading and labour market strength, and will likely just await incoming data on wages, inflation and growth.\nIt was the first time that the main eurozone interest rate had been reduced in almost five years.\nA second rate cut \u201cfeels ambitious\u201d, he said.",

        "body": "Economic growth will bring prosperity to all. This is the mantra that guides the decision-making of the vast majority of politicians, economists and even human rights bodies.\n\nYet the reality \u2013 as detailed in a report to the United Nations Human Rights Council this month \u2013 shows that while poverty eradication has historically been promised through the \u201ctrickling down\u201d or \u201credistribution\u201d of wealth, economic growth largely \u201cgushes up\u201d to a privileged few.\n\nIn the past four years alone the world\u2019s five richest men have more than doubled their fortunes, while nearly 5 billion people have been made poorer. If current trends continue, 575 million people will still be trapped in extreme poverty in 2030 \u2013 the deadline set by the world\u2019s governments to eradicate it. Currently, more than 4 billion people have no access whatsoever to social protection.\n\nHundreds of millions of people are struggling to survive in a world that has never been wealthier; many are driven to exhaustion in poorly paid, often dangerous jobs to satisfy the needs of the elite and to boost corporate profits. In low-income countries, where significant investment is still required, growth can still serve a useful role. In practice, however, it is often extractive, relying on the exploitation of a cheap workforce and the plundering of natural resources.\n\nConcrete steps can be taken now, starting with choosing measures of progress other than gross domestic product\n\nThe endless quest for growth at all costs, and the escalating use of the natural resources it demands, is pushing our planet way beyond its limits. Six of the nine \u201cplanetary boundaries\u201d \u2013 Earth\u2019s life-support systems \u2013 have already been crossed. For too long, the health of our planet has been sacrificed for inequitable material gain.\n\nOur economies are failing us. We urgently need to look beyond profit, beyond the short term and beyond the interests of the few.\n\nA \u201chuman rights economy\u201d can deliver for people and the planet because it shifts our focus from growth to humanity \u2013 grounding the purpose of the economy in fundamental, universal human values. It offers human rights as a guardrail to keep the economy on track \u2013 meeting the challenges of the climate crisis, addressing inequalities and eradicating poverty.\n\nThis proposition is not some fairytale. Concrete steps can be taken now, starting with choosing measures of progress other than gross domestic product (GDP) \u2013 which tells us nothing about the ecological or social fallout of economic activity.\n\nAnd we need to start valuing what really counts. GDP has no way of accounting for the estimated 16.4bn hours spent every day worldwide on unpaid work, largely carried out by women, that underpins the global economy: caring for children, people with disabilities and older citizens.\n\nUnpaid domestic and care work should be remunerated through paid parental and carers\u2019 leave, included in pension calculations, and supported through access to safe water, sanitation, affordable childcare facilities and other essential services.\n\nFinancing these services while reducing our dependence on GDP growth is achievable through progressive tax policies such as inheritance and wealth taxes, preventing illegal financial flows and tax evasion, and tackling corruption. More effective international cooperation on tax, debt and social protection is also needed.\n\nskip past newsletter promotion Sign up to Global Dispatch Free newsletter Get a different world view with a roundup of the best news, features and pictures, curated by our global development team Enter your email address Sign up Privacy Notice: Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

The barriers are real: most people have been led to believe that economic growth equals human progress. Yet a growing movement is rallying against our growth-driven economic model: climate activists, workers and trade unions, scientists and academics, young people, environmental and human rights defenders, Indigenous peoples, progressive economists, and activists fighting inequality, gender disparities and colonialism are speaking out.\n\nAs world leaders prepare to gather for the Summit of the Future in September \u2013 a UN initiative that aims to forge a global consensus around what our future should look like \u2013 this groundswell of support for an alternative vision of progress must be embraced. Without a roadmap for a global economy that protects human rights, including the right to a clean, healthy and sustainable environment, the final document leaders agree in New York will continue to lead us down the path to extinction.",

        "title": "Greece introduces \u2018growth-oriented\u2019 six-day working week",
        "body": "Companies in countries worldwide may be toying with the idea of implementing shorter working weeks, but in Greece employees have been told that, henceforth, they can put in a sixth day of labour in an unorthodox step aimed at turbocharging productivity.\n\nAfter outpacing other Europeans in terms of economic growth, the nation once at the heart of the continent\u2019s worst financial crisis has bucked the trend again, introducing a 48-hour working week. The measure, decried as \u201cbarbaric\u201d by unions, takes effect from Monday.\n\n\u201cIt makes no sense whatsoever,\u201d said Akis Sotiropoulos an executive committee member of the civil servants\u2019 union Adedy. \u201cWhen almost every other civilised country is enacting a four-day week, Greece decides to go the other way.\u201d\n\nThe pro-business government of the prime minister, Kyriakos Mitsotakis, says the initiative was made necessary by the twin perils of a shrinking population and shortage of skilled workers. Prior to announcing the legislation \u2013 part of a broader set of labour laws passed last year \u2013 Mitsotakis described the projected demographic shift as a \u201cticking timebomb\u201d. In an unprecedented exodus, about 500,000 mostly young educated Greeks are estimated to have emigrated since the near decade-long debt crisis erupted in late 2009.\n\nThe six-day scheme, officials say, will only apply to private businesses providing round-the-clock services. Under the extended working week, staff in select industries and manufacturing facilities will have the option of working an additional two hours a day or an extra eight-hour shift, rewarded with a top-up fee of 40% added to the daily wage.\n\nEither choice, the centre right government claims, will redress the issue of employees not being paid for overtime while also tackling the pervasive problem of undeclared work.\n\n\u201cThe nucleus of this legislation is worker-friendly, it is deeply growth-oriented,\u201d Mitsotakis said before the Greek parliament endorsed the law. \u201cAnd it brings Greece in line with the rest of Europe.\u201d\n\nBut the backlash has been fierce. In a country with almost no tradition of inspections in the workplace, critics contend the reform ultimately sounds the death knell of the five-day working week, not least because it enables employers to dictate whether a sixth day of labour is required.\n\nFor opponents, who have already taken to the streets in protest, the reform erodes legal protections and rolls back long-established workers\u2019 rights in the name of flexibility.\n\n\u201cIn reality this has been passed by a government ideologically committed to generating ever bigger profits for capital,\u201d said Sotiropoulos. \u201cBetter productivity comes with better work conditions, a better quality of life [for employees] and that, we now know, is about less hours not more.\u201d\n\nThe measure, he said, had been made possible partly because trade unions had also seen their power wane as a result of debt-stricken Athens enacting austerity measures in return for rescue funds during the country\u2019s financial crisis. Unions have long argued that overtime enables employers to hold back on hiring more staff.\n\nTrialled four-day week programmes have repeatedly shown increased levels of productivity with researchers attributing the outcome to improved levels of focus. Belgium in 2022 legislated to give employees the legal right to spread their working week over four days instead of five, and pilot schemes have been carried out in countries including the UK, Germany, Japan, South Africa and Canada.\n\nGreeks already work the longest hours in Europe, putting in an average 41 hours a week according to the EU\u2019s statistics agency, Eurostat, although surveys have also proved they get paid much less. The left-wing opposition has frequently decried \u201cBulgarian salaries in a country of British prices\u201d, claiming the phenomenon has only exacerbated the brain drain.\n\nPeople on pensions, who have also been encouraged to work under the legislation, have weighed into the debate.\n\n\u201cWhat the government is essentially saying is \u2018go and work longer, we\u2019ll turn a blind eye even if you\u2019re a pensioner,\u2019\u201d said Grigoris Kalomoiris who heads the union of retired teachers (Pesek).\n\n\u201cIt knows that the majority of Greeks, on an average monthly salary of \u20ac900, can only survive until the 20th of the month. This latest barbaric measure is not going to solve the fundamental problem of labour shortages and a lot of us feel it is very unfair to unemployed young Greeks who may never have a job.\u201d",

        "title": "Nick Hartley obituary",
        "body": "Nick Hartley, who has died aged 80, was a respected economist and in the 1990s served as head of energy, economics and statistics at the Department of Trade and Industry.\n\nHis reputation was made as chief economist at Oftel (the Office of Telecommunications) for six years from 1984. He was then chief economist at the Department of the Environment (1990-94), before becoming head of energy, economics and statistics at the DTI, a post, he liked to point out, once held by Harold Wilson. In 1996, Nick joined the economic consultancy Oxera, from where he was seconded to the Cabinet Office to head up a report on energy policy.\n\nBorn in London, the only child of Nancy (nee Fulton), a dressmaker, and Edward Hartley, a publican, Nick went to St Clement Danes grammar school, Hammersmith, where he and I met in 1955. Sitting side by side in assembly for the headteacher\u2019s address to the new boys, he introduced himself: \u201cHello, I\u2019m Hartley, like the jam.\u201d\n\nIn the sixth form we were told by our economics teacher, Jack Harvey, to apply to St Catharine\u2019s College, Cambridge, to study economics. We arrived in 1962 during a winter so cold that the River Granta froze, and Nick and I would walk on it to Grantchester.\n\nAfter graduating, Nick passed the civil service exam and became assistant principal at the Department for Education, where he worked for JAR Pimlott setting up polytechnics (1965-69). From there, he moved to the Treasury as an economic adviser (1969-84). He was seconded from the Treasury twice, in 1970-71 to do an MPhil at York University, and in 1974-77, to the Royal Commission on the Press.\n\nLatterly he was a companion of the Guild of St George, a charity for arts and crafts founded by John Ruskin who, Nick said, \u201cwas asking all the right questions about the way work and society should be organised\u201d.

        "body": "Paul Krugman (How the \u2018unforced error\u2019 of austerity wrecked Britain, 28 June) hits the nail on the head when he says that there was no economic case for the austerity that the coalition government foisted on us in 2010, the effects of which are still with us. It was a political choice on the part of George Osborne and David Cameron to advance their class interest, cleverly camouflaged by stories of Labour profligacy when the economic crisis to which it was the alleged response was caused by a surfeit of financial deregulation advocated by Osborne and Cameron and supinely accepted by Labour.\n\nThe American political economist Clara E Mattei, in her 2022 book, The Capital Order: How Economists Invented Austerity and Paved the Way to Fascism, showed how similar policies were applied in Britain and Italy after the first world war, essentially to keep workers in their place, and how in Italy they led to the rise of Mussolini and fascism. Let us be warned.\n\nProf Roger Brown\n\nSouthampton\n\nPaul Krugman is right about the impact of austerity on the UK economy \u2013 here are a couple of reasons why. First, those who advocate the shrinking of the state fail to appreciate how the economy is interdependent. Most public authorities require tendering for services. Generally, the private or voluntary sectors get the tender. So if the public sector is starved of finance and catches a cold, the private and voluntary sectors start to sneeze too.\n\nSecond, the assumption is that if the public sector is smaller, the private sector will take up the slack. This ignores the fact that the private sector\u2019s bottom line is its profitability and ability to satisfy its shareholders, not the public interest. In practice, this means that the private sector will cherry-pick the easy and profitable tasks, as with the failed privatisation of the probation service, while leaving anything difficult or unprofitable to the public sector.\n\nAlternatively, as with the failed privatisation of the railways, the private sector demands subsidies out of our taxes so that it can pay a dividend to its shareholders, thereby taking money out of the system that could otherwise be used to improve the infrastructure, reduce fares, or both.\n\nAusterity was an ideological choice by the coalition government. While I would have expected little better from the Conservatives, I would have hoped that their Liberal Democrat coalition partners would have drawn enough red lines to prevent the government from following through on its economic illiteracy and choking off the first signs of recovery from the 2007-08 crash. As it is, we\u2019ve suffered from the consequences ever since.\n\nDave Pollard\n\nLeicester\n\nPaul Krugman does an excellent job of exposing the disastrous consequences of 14 years of austerity for both society and the economy. But in solely blaming the Tories, he neglects to acknowledge the role of the Liberal Democrats in both enabling austerity and even co-authoring the genesis of the policy through the key role played by the then chief secretary to the Treasury David Laws.\n\nAlthough in post for only a short time, his role was pivotal in developing the first drastic cuts in public expenditure. We now live with the consequences of 14 years of monetarist dogma ruthlessly, pitilessly and unfairly applied.\n\nAlan Beynon\n\nBarmby Moor, East Yorkshire",

        "body": "2d ago 15.26 CEST Northern Irish politicians have raised concerns over the future of as many as 1,400 workers at the Spirit Aerosystems factory in Belfast, after its takeover by planemaker Airbus. Boeing has announced the takeover of Spirit Aerosystems as it tries to retake control of its supply chain following a series of production issues. As part of that deal Airbus will take over Spirit operations serving it, including in Belfast which makes wings and fuselages for the small A220 jet. However, the Unite union has said that 40% of the 3,600 workforce is employed on parts that are not related to Airbus projects, including work for Bombardier and Rolls-Royce. Airbus did not say whether it plans to continue that work. Local politicians are concerned that job losses may result at an historic factory that traces its history back to Short Brothers, the first company to make production aircraft. First minister Michelle O\u2019Neill and deputy first minister Emma Little-Pengelly released statements in which they said the government was working with the company to preserve the Belfast operations. Economy minister Conor Murphy said: \u201cI have been engaging with the company and union on the acquisition and will work with all key stakeholders to ensure that the future status of the highly skilled workforce is protected.\u201d Reuters reported: The leader of Northern Ireland\u2019s largest unionist party, the Democratic Unionist Party\u2019s (DUP) Gavin Robinson, said the sale represented only \u201ca partial solution\u201d. Steve Aiken, a member of the smaller Ulster Unionist Party, said it was an outcome \u201cneither management, workforce or the unions desired\u201d, calling on Northern Ireland\u2019s economy minister to intervene to ensure the entire business is retained. \u201cThe minister also needs to emphasis to Airbus the considerable investment the Northern Irish and UK governments have made in wing and aerostructure manufacturing in Belfast and that we will not be allowing our aircraft industry to be asset stripped and manufacturing moved elsewhere,\u201d Aiken added. Share\n\n2d ago 14.45 CEST German inflation drops as European Central Bank mulls further rate cuts German inflation has dropped slightly more than expected to 2.2% year-on-year in June, as the European Central Bank (ECB) considers whether to cut interest rates again. It dropped from 2.4% in May, and was slightly lower than the 2.3% forecast. The ECB has a 2% inflation target, but it has cut borrowing costs because it believes that inflationary pressure is easing. A further reduction in inflation could support that view. Carsten Brzeski, global head of macro at ING, a Dutch investment bank, said the reading keeps the door open to further ECB rate cuts, but added that inflation \u201cremains sticky above 2%. He wrote: Looking ahead, the stickiness of inflation at slightly too high a level looks set to continue as favourable energy base effects are petering out while, at the same time, wages are increasing. With recent new wage demands, it is hard to see German wage growth coming down in the second half of the year. Claus Vistesen, chief eurozone economist at Pantheon Macroeconomics, a consultancy, a September cut is likely. He said: said: Looking further ahead for Germany, we see scope for a further decline in headline inflation to below 2% by August, helping to get a 25 basis point rate cut over the line in September, before a rebound to just under 2.5% by the end of the year.

Photograph: Kirill Kudryavtsev/AFP/Getty Images Mark Zuckerberg\u2019s Meta has breached the EU\u2019s new digital laws with an advertising model that charges users for ad-free versions of Facebook and Instagram, according to the European Commission. Meta launched a \u201cpay or consent\u201d model last year in an effort to comply with the bloc\u2019s data privacy rules, where users pay a monthly fee for an ad-free version of Facebook or Instagram that does not use their personal data for advertising purposes, writes the Guardian\u2019s Dan Milmo. Users who do not pay have, as part of the signing up process for the platforms, consented to their data being used to tailor personalised adverts that appear in their social media feeds. The European Commission, the EU\u2019s executive body, said the model does not comply with the Digital Markets Act, which is designed to rein in big tech companies. The commission issued preliminary findings from an investigation into \u201cpay or consent\u201d on Monday and found the model \u201cforces users to consent\u201d to their data being collected from multiple platforms. It also does not allow users to choose a service that uses less of their data but is broadly similar to the \u201cwith adverts\u201d versions of Facebook and Instagram, the commission said.

Other unions have complained that there has been no progress in the last six weeks, but Unite suggested that Tata had changed stance. Tata has stuck to its position that the two blast furnaces must close this year. However, a plan backed by counterpart unions Community and GMB suggested keeping one furnace open for longer while readying a large investment in greener technology (such as a direct reduced iron plant) to convert iron ore to iron, which could then be fed into an electric arc furnace. That plan would preserve jobs on the blast furnaces for several years, and would then require more workers to run in the longer term \u2013 although nowhere near the 2,800 employees who could be out of work by the autumn. View image in fullscreen Unite union general secretary Sharon Graham. Photograph: Jacob King/PA Sharon Graham, Unite\u2019s general secretary, said: This is a significant development in the battle to protect jobs and the long-term future of steel making in South Wales. Investment from Labour secured by Unite will be key to the future of the site. This breakthrough would not have come about without the courage of our members at Port Talbot who were prepared to stand up and fight for their jobs. Workers were simply not prepared to stand idly by while steel making ended and their communities were laid to waste. It is essential that these talks progress swiftly and in good faith with the focus on fresh investment and ensuring the long-term continuation of steel making in South Wales. Share\n\n2d ago 12.59 CEST Tata Steel had written to the three main unions representing steelworkers at Port Talbot offering more talks over its plans to cut 2,800 jobs as it closes the blast furnaces if the strike threat were removed. Owner of Port Talbot steelworks offers fresh talks as last furnace faces closure Read more The unions are hopeful that a Labour government would persuade Tata Steel to delay the closure of at least one blast furnace, preserving thousands of jobs for several years. Unite had threatened strike action from 8 July \u2013 after the planned closure of the first blast furnace. The other unions were hanging on for a Labour government after 4 July. Shadow business secretary Jonathan Reynolds has already been in talks with the unions and the company in an effort to avert the closures. Alun Davies, national officer for Community, which represents most of the affected steelworkers, said: With thousands of jobs at stake, we welcome Unite\u2019s decision to withdraw their strike action and get back around the table with their sister steel unions. Tata confirmed that if the strike was called off they are ready to resume discussions on a potential [memorandum of understanding], through the multi-union steel committee which is chaired by Community. The truth is Tata never walked away from those discussions, and at our last meeting on 22 May all unions agreed to conclude the negotiations and put the outcome to our members. Community will welcome resuming those discussions, but we regret that zero progress has been made since 22 May.

Photograph: Ben Birchall/PA A union representing some workers at Tata Steel\u2019s works in Port Talbot, south Wales, has suspended strikes after talks with the company. Unite union is understood to have suspended the strike threat after high-level talks between union officials and the company. Tata plans to close two blast furnaces at the site and shift towards much cleaner electric arc furnaces. However, unions want them to delay the closure \u2013 the first of which is due this week \u2013 to await a Labour government.

The UK\u2019s purchasing managers\u2019 index (PMI) from S&P Global suggests it is doing better than Europe. The PMI reading came in at 50.9 in June, still well into expansionary territory, in contrast to the two-year contraction in Europe. The reading was worse than the initial flash estimate of 51.4, and down slightly from May\u2019s 22-month high of 51.2. View image in fullscreen Output from the UK manufacturing sector has picked up in recent months. Photograph: S&P Global Rob Dobson, director at S&P Global Market Intelligence, said: The UK manufacturing sector is enjoying its strongest spell of growth for over two years, with June seeing output and new order growth sustained at robust rates similar to May\u2019s recent highs. The performance of the domestic market remains a real positive, providing a ripe source of new contract wins. In contrast, the ongoing weak export performance is concerning, with manufacturers reporting difficulties in securing new business in several key markets including the US, China and mainland Europe. However, that did not stop companies from making job and spending cuts and trying to run down inventories of unsold products, Dobson said. Inflation may be partly behind that: This is coming from a backdrop of renewed cost inflation pressure, with manufacturers\u2019 input prices now rising at the quickest pace since the start of 2023. This renewed upward lurch in manufacturing prices will likely add to concerns over the potential stubbornness of underlying inflationary pressures among hawkish rate setters at the Bank of England.

        "title": "London investment bankers to rake in bigger bonuses after two-year slump",
        "body": "London\u2019s investment bankers are expected to rake in bigger bonuses this financial year, as the City begins to recover from a two-year slump in deals caused by surging interest rates.\n\nDemand for investment banking services \u2013 such as facilitating mergers and acquisitions, advising companies and governments on fundraising, and underwriting new stock and bonds \u2013 was hit by a sharp increase in borrowing rates after the pandemic, as central banks acted to tame runaway inflation. Jobs and pay were cut as investment banks sought to reduce costs.\n\nBut the rate hike cycle has ended, with the UK and US expected to begin reducing the cost of borrowing before Christmas. Forecasters say the recent increase in dealmaking is likely to be felt during the spring bonus season.\n\n\u201cThe outlook for 2024 is brightening after a promising first quarter and there are signs of capital markets activity thawing after a two-year freeze,\u201d Dartmouth Partners, a recruiter for banks, consulting firms and startups, said in its annual compensation survey covering London investment bankers.\n\nThat is likely to mean bigger bonuses for investment bankers at the London offices of \u201cbulge bracket\u201d firms including JP Morgan, Goldman Sachs, and Deutsche Bank, rewarding those who managed to keep their jobs and wait out nearly two years of falling payouts.\n\n\u201cIt feels like there\u2019s more of a an upswing happening,\u201d the Dartmouth Partners founder, Logan Naidu, told the Guardian. \u201cEven if the revenue is not quite there, the activity is and I would suspect that compensation would go up on last year. Will it be back up to where it was in 2021-22? I doubt it is going to be that good. But I think it will be better than than last year.\u201d\n\nNaidu said the UK\u2019s decision to scrap the banker bonus cap, which previously limited bonuses to 100% of salaries, would probably mean that salary rises could be replaced with larger bonuses over the long term. \u201cWhat might happen is base pay starts to get a bit more suppressed, and variable comp starts to become a larger part of the narrative again, which is probably good news for the banks in terms of how they manage their cost base.\u201d\n\nThere is still time for most investment bankers to build their bonus pots. While junior analysts will be paid out at the end of the summer, bonus decisions for higher-level staff will be made at the end of the year.\n\nDartmouth Partners released data showing average pay tumbled last year across most investment banking positions at eight of the major investment banks, ranging from junior-level analysts to more senior associates and vice-president roles.\n\nWhile lower-paid analysts took home bonuses worth an average of \u00a344,267 in 2023 \u2013 marking a near 50% increase compared with a year earlier \u2013 mid-tier associates\u2019 bonus payouts fell by nearly a fifth to \u00a380,065 on average, sending their total pay down 8.3% to \u00a3213,940.\n\nMeanwhile, some vice-presidents had their bonuses slashed by 22% to \u00a3135,183, reducing total average pay by 11.8% to \u00a3303,204.\n\nThe survey, which interviewed more than 250 London-based bankers \u2013 working at Goldman Sachs, JP Morgan, UBS, Barclays, Morgan Stanley, Citi, Deutsche Bank and Bank of America \u2013 found that a number of bankers working at European firms were hoping to jump ship to their American rivals, which tend to offer higher overall compensation.\n\nBut even Goldman Sachs cut pay for its vice-presidents by 7.6% on average, while its associates were hit by an 8.3% drop. JP Morgan vice-presidents experienced a 7% cut and associate pay fell by 4.6%.\n\nskip past newsletter promotion Sign up to Business Today Free daily newsletter Get set for the working day \u2013 we'll point you to all the business news and analysis you need every morning Enter your email address Sign up Privacy Notice: Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Macron\u2019s government had promised to cut the budget deficit from 5.5% of gross domestic product last year to a European Union ceiling of 3% by 2027 \u2013 an objective that may be unattainable after the vote, which concludes with a second round on 7 July.\n\nIf it forms a government, Marine Le Pen\u2019s National Rally (RN) wants to cut value-added tax (VAT) on energy, which it says would cost \u20ac7bn (\u00a35.9bn) for the rest of this year and \u20ac12bn in a full year. The RN would also scrap a 2023 increase in the retirement age to 64 from 62, and says its spending plans would be paid for by cutting contributions to the EU budget.\n\nThe left-wing New Popular Front alliance, now polling second, says its first moves would include a 10% civil servant pay hike, providing free school lunches, supplies and transport while raising housing subsidies by 10%.\n\nThe turmoil has sent the cost to the French government of servicing its debt on the international markets rocketing, with the risk premium, or spread, demanded by holders of French debt over Germany\u2019s rising to its highest level since 2012.\n\nskip past newsletter promotion Sign up to Business Today Free daily newsletter Get set for the working day \u2013 we'll point you to all the business news and analysis you need every morning Enter your email address Sign up Privacy Notice: Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

The big three \u2013 Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 G\u00e9n\u00e9rale, BNP Paribas and Cr\u00e9dit Agricole \u2013 are down 10%-14% since Macron\u2019s announcement.\n\nFrench banks have a large amount of debt and are expected to suffer if credit costs increase sharply.\n\nThe positive for Carstens was that central banks have successfully reined in inflation, which had hit decades-long highs after the Covid-19 pandemic, and then Russia\u2019s 2022 invasion of Ukraine, which riled commodity markets.\n\n\u201cCompared to last year, I have to say we are in a much better place,\u201d the former Mexican central bank governor said.\n\nAlthough Carstens said central banks deserved praise for navigating a difficult path that could have resulted in a wave of recessions, he added that they needed to persevere, likening the inflation fight to a course of antibiotics to tackle an illness.\n\nHe described an \u201cextreme\u201d scenario where inflation raced up again and central banks needed to raise rates further.

Here are a few that I\u2019ve seen.\n\nUniform patches\n\nOne known economic indicator is jobs and for that we tend to rely on unemployment numbers from the Bureau of Labor Statistics. But maybe there\u2019s something better. Like the number of uniform patches sold each year. Uniform patches? Yes, those are the emblems that go on the uniforms worn by millions of workers, from fast food cashiers to drywall contractors. The financial data of one of the world\u2019s largest makers of emblems and patches \u2013 privately held World Emblem \u2013 can\u2019t be easily obtained. But the company\u2019s owner recently told USA Today that sales are up 19% from the same period last year. A recession? \u201cWe\u2019re not seeing it,\u201d says Randy Carr, CEO of the Fort Lauderdale, Florida-based company. \u201cIt\u2019s hard to believe there would be.\u201d\n\nMen\u2019s underwear\n\nAsk any guy about underwear, and they\u2019ll usually admit the same thing. When times are good, we\u2019re buying the good material. When money\u2019s tight, we\u2019re wearing those things until they literally fall off. So do men\u2019s underwear sales mirror the economy overall? Some \u2013 including former Federal Reserve chief Alan Greenspan \u2013 think so. If you want to check out how the men\u2019s underwear business is doing you can look at Hanesbrands or PVH Corp (which owns several leading brands, including Calvin Klein and Tommy Hilfiger) or Ralph Lauren Corporation. \u201cBottom\u201d line: men\u2019s underwear sales have been mostly flat over the past 12 months.\n\nLipstick\n\nFor the most part, lipstick is a relatively inexpensive accessory, with a typical tube costing anywhere from $5 to $20. History has shown that women will cut back on more expensive beauty goods like makeup and perfume when times are tight. But lipstick? Don\u2019t even go there. When lipstick sales increase as luxury beauty item accessories decrease, that\u2019s another potential sign of economic headwinds. Where to research lipstick sales? Try the big cosmetics companies like L\u2019Oreal, Estee Lauder and Ulta Beauty. All three companies have shown strong revenue gains over the past year.\n\nOverseas freight\n\nWorld shipping has a significant impact on our economy and instead of tracking units and cargo activity, some economists instead track the price of freight. Why? Because in a supply and demand world, the greater the demand for shipping, the more freight should cost. To track this phenomena, look no further than the Baltic Dry Index. This is a well-watched measure of freight costs for shipping items across the Baltic Sea, one of the world\u2019s busiest shipping lanes. So how are freight costs doing? They\u2019re up more than 55% over the past year and even slightly higher than pre-Covid times.\n\nskip past newsletter promotion Sign up to Business Today Free daily newsletter Get set for the working day \u2013 we'll point you to all the business news and analysis you need every morning Enter your email address Sign up Privacy Notice: Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

It\u2019s fun and a great way to explore our national parks. Some economists think that RV sales are an economic indicator because RVs \u2013 a luxury item - are not only expensive to buy, but they come with high maintenance costs and tend to calculate gas usage by gallons per mile. So how\u2019s the RV industry doing? Judging by one of America\u2019s largest makers of these vehicles \u2013 Winnebago \u2013 not so great. Sales have been declining for the past few years and the company\u2019s stock price has fallen 35% in the past year.\n\nI\u2019m only scratching the surface on unusual economic indicators. Besides RVs you can follow the sales of champagne. Instead of men\u2019s underwear you can also track women\u2019s hemlines (which are believed to rise and fall along with the stock market). You can dig into the buttered popcorn index (which some say increases during times of recession as a small bit of a luxury in an otherwise cruel world). You can even keep track of hairstyles in Japan, where some say that women wear their hair longer when times are good and shorter when times are tough. Good luck finding this data, let alone making any sense of it.\n\nGoofy economic metrics like these are fun to talk about with your friends and colleagues. But they shouldn\u2019t be taken seriously. I run a business, and my go-to economic indicator is my clients. I\u2019ve learned that the best way to insulate my business from the economy is to diversify: have as many clients in as many industries and geographic locations as possible. The US is a big country, and even when one client is cutting back on his underwear purchases in Illinois, I\u2019ll likely have another buying uniform emblems in Texas. Focus on this instead of lipstick.",

        "body": "Down the years the Conservative party has taken some heavy election beatings but the one in prospect this week could be of a different order of magnitude.\n\nAssuming the polls are right \u2013 and they have been consistent since the start of the campaign \u2013 the Tories will do worse even than in 1906, their previous nadir. Back then, the Conservatives and their Liberal Unionist allies won just 156 seats, a repeat of which on Thursday would now be considered a good result.\n\nBut in 1906, Arthur Balfour\u2019s outgoing government secured more than 43% of the vote, while Rishi Sunak is polling at about half that level. And Balfour\u2019s defeat could at least be attributed to a policy issue \u2013 free trade versus protectionism. Today, voters just seem sick of the Tories.\n\nNews on the economy since the election was called has had little or no impact on the polls. In part, that\u2019s because the signals have been mixed: inflation fell back to its 2% target and growth in the first quarter of 2024 has been revised up, but the economy stagnated in April and unemployment has increased.\n\nLiving standards are certainly improving. The Resolution Foundation thinktank calculates that real per capita household disposable income \u2013 a guide to whether people are getting better off after inflation is taken into account \u2013 rose by 2.4% over the past year.\n\nThat\u2019s the good news. The bad news is that over the 2019-24 parliament as a whole, living standards fell by 0.6% and one of the unwritten rules of political economy is that governments don\u2019t remain popular when voters are getting poorer.\n\nOnly twice in the past century have living standards been lower at the end of a parliament than when it commenced: in 1918-22, when the UK suffered from a post-first world war boom-bust, and in the short parliament of 1950-51, when inflation rose sharply as a result of the rearmament programme for the Korean war.\n\nIn the inevitable postmortem examination that will follow the election, attention will focus on whether the Tories might have done better had Sunak delayed the election so that in time more voters would have come to think an economic corner genuinely had been turned. Another quarter or two of rising living standards would not have saved the Conservatives from defeat but it would probably have limited the scale of it.\n\nAs it is, Rachel Reeves will be the beneficiary. Analysts have been revising up their growth estimates for 2024 and 2025 on the basis that consumers will start to run down the precautionary savings they accumulated during the cost of living crisis.\n\nOther recent developments \u2013 especially those overseas \u2013 are not so welcome. Joe Biden\u2019s poor performance in his head to head debate with Donald Trump has made it more likely that the latter will win the US presidential election. Tariffs will be raised and taxes will be cut if that happens, threatening higher inflation and rising debt.\n\nMeanwhile, the first round of voting in France\u2019s parliamentary election looks set to show sizeable gains for Marine Le Pen\u2019s rightwing National Rally party and a defeat for Emmanuel Macron\u2019s centrist government.\n\nEvents in both the US and France highlight how things have changed in the near decade and a half since Labour was last in power.\n\nskip past newsletter promotion Sign up to Business Today Free daily newsletter Get set for the working day \u2013 we'll point you to all the business news and analysis you need every morning Enter your email address Sign up Privacy Notice: Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

The war between Ukraine and Russia is now well into its third year and has shattered the notion that permanent peace can be guaranteed for western developed nations. There are always demands for Labour governments to spend more on the NHS and on the welfare state. This time there will also be pressure to raise defence spending.\n\nGlobalisation has gone into retreat. Weak growth since the financial crisis of 2008-09 has seen a marked increase in protectionist measures \u2013 not just on goods but on people too. In Europe, North America and Australasia alike there have been demands for governments to restrict the number of foreign nationals entering the country.\n\nWhat\u2019s more, multilateral bodies are for the most part weaker than they were in 2010. The increasingly fractious relationship between the US and China means the G20 group of leading developed and developing nations cannot agree on much. The World Trade Organization is a much-diminished institution, unable to fulfil either of its core functions: to negotiate multilateral trade deals and be the final arbiter in trade disputes. The EU is having to contend with rising nationalist sentiment, a function of feeble economic performance and a reaction against rule by unelected technocrats.\n\nThe developing world has been even harder hit by Covid and the cost of living crisis than the rich west, increasing the incentive for migrants to look for a better life elsewhere. Yet aid budgets have been cut and promises to help poor countries cope with the impact of climate change have not been fulfilled. The world is getting hotter and the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank urgently need more money to meet demands for their assistance.\n\nSo those are the sort of challenges that Labour will face when it takes office later this week. Not the world of 1997, when Russia was seen as an ally rather than a strategic threat. Not the middle of the Great Moderation \u2013 the period between the fall of communism and the global financial crisis \u2013 when the west enjoyed year after year of growth and low inflation, but rather a world still trying to claw its way out of the Great Stagnation of the past 15 years.\n\nAnd an angrier world where voters can quickly turn on their governments. Labour should enjoy its honeymoon period. It might not last long.",

        "body": "Having children has become an unaffordable luxury for many of her generation, says Vanessa, a 35-year-old project manager living in Brighton.\n\n\u201cMy friends who managed to start a family, without exception, all received large sums of money from their parents to get on the property ladder. For those of us not fortunate enough, we are trapped in the rental market, largely with insecure, poorly paid employment.\u201d\n\nVanessa\u2019s outlook is also clouded by concerns about the climate crisis, crumbling public services and the \u201cplummeting mental health of young people\u201d, she says. \u201cPut these into the mix and you have a perfect storm for declining birthrates.\u201d\n\nHer decision is replicated worldwide. The number of women of child-bearing age is in long-term decline across Europe, parts of Asia, South America and the US, a situation made worse by the steep drop in the number of women, and their partners, who either want or are able to have children.\n\nThese factors have led to a sharp fall in fertility rates \u2013 the number of children born to each woman.\n\nWhile the issues facing governments from rapidly ageing populations are relatively familiar, a decline in fertility rates that was once limited to Japan has spread across the world. Today, almost every continent has a growing age-dependency ratio as average birthrates fall and people live longer. If the global population hits 10.4 billion in the 2080s as predicted, it will only be because sub-Saharan Africa has continued on its current trend, pushing the population across the African continent from about 1.5 billion to as many as 2.5 billion.\n\nHere we look at the trends, and the implications for future governments, of a demographic revolution.\n\nHow the UK is affected\n\nThe total fertility rate across England and Wales fell to 1.49 children per woman in 2022, from 1.55 in 2021, according to the Office for National Statistics (ONS).\n\nAs a benchmark, the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) says that to maintain a population, the \u201creplacement rate\u201d, often known as the \u201cR-rate\u201d, needs to be at least 2.1 children per woman.\n\nIt has been well documented that the pandemic, rather than spark a baby boom, had the reverse effect. Yet the recent drop in fertility has shocked demographers. The rate was already declining, starting in 2010: then came Covid-19, the Russian invasion of Ukraine and a deepening of the climate crisis, which all appeared to add a further downward shift, taking the fertility rate to the lowest since comparative data began being kept in the 1930s.\n\nAnn Berrington, a professor of demography and social statistics at Southampton University, says: \u201cThe Human Fertility Database covering England and Wales documents the 1960s baby boom, 1970s baby bust, the fluctuations of the 1980s and 1990s that kept things fairly stable, increases through 2000s to 2010, and then a decline to the historical low levels seen today.\u201d\n\nThe trend in Scotland follows the same pattern, but on a lower trajectory during each period over the last 60 years. Northern Ireland follows the same pattern on a slightly elevated path. ONS figures tracking live births tell the same story of decline. They show 605,479 in England and Wales in 2022, a 3.1% fall from 2021 and the lowest number since 2002.\n\nThis figure is not an all-time low because the UK\u2019s population has been expanding since 2003, when the UK embraced the free movement of people from countries that had recently joined the EU. Opening its doors to workers from eastern Europe resulted in an increase in total births, and maintained fertility rates, which were about the same for UK-born and foreign-born women at the time.\n\nBut when record numbers of women are reaching the age of 30 child-free, the effect has clearly waned.\n\nAccording to the latest data, half of women born in 1990 were childless by their 30th birthday \u2013 the first generation for which that is true.\n\nIt\u2019s the economy \u2026\n\nWhen the Observer asked readers, including Vanessa, to say why they had not had children, or had restricted the size of their family, most replied that financial constraints were the main reason.\n\nHannah, a 35-year-old marketing executive living in London, says she had been unable to have the two children she wanted with her partner of 10 years, despite moving to a cheaper area to secure a bigger home.\n\nChildcare costs were prohibitively high, along with other costs of living, she says. \u201cThe family we want to have is financially out of reach. We have only ever had one holiday together since our relationship began. We are cutting down on food bills and looking for extra work to make having a child happen.\u201d She and her partner are considering moving abroad.\n\nIn the early 00s, Britain and France were outliers in Europe. Both countries had generous family benefits and governments with a stated aim of supporting children. The scale of generosity, from tax credits for low earners to an expansion of early years centres and childcare subsidies, meant both countries \u2013 under Labour in the UK and the Gaullist centre-right in France \u2013 arrested declines over previous decades.\n\nIn the UK and France, these subsidies were scaled back after the recessions of 2008-09. Austerity across all public services was the message from Nicolas Sarkozy, France\u2019s president from 2007 to 2012, and from the UK \u2019s coalition government from 2010 to 2015.\n\nFor all the impact of welfare and public service cuts, a study by Fathom Consulting indicates those interested in creating a family look further ahead. In the aftermath of the financial crash of 2008, it was clear the future for many households looked bleak, with incomes flat and costs, especially housing, on a steady incline. Without the optimism of previous generations, couples decided not to have children, according to the initial findings from a study of Japan that links declines in fertility with periods when the future outlook for the economy was uncertain.\n\n\u201cIt turns out that there is a good relationship between forecasts of 15-year forward growth in Japan at any point in time and the fertility rate in Japan at the same point in time,\u201d says the report.\n\n\u201cIn other words, people have kids when they feel optimistic that, when their kids join the workforce, the standard of living they will enjoy will be better than it is now.\u201d\n\nTo measure growth, the report used national income per capita, which has improved in Japan while the overall economy has stagnated. Japan\u2019s fertility rate is 1.3, just ahead of Italy\u2019s 1.2 and South Korea\u2019s 0.8.\n\nView image in fullscreen Fiona Powley, a trainer and facilitator who runs Bristol Childfree Women.\n\nThe consultancy\u2019s director, Erik Britton, says the research is ongoing and the conclusions only tentative, but the initial findings reveal that government support, while a necessary element, might not be the most important factor. A nation confidently growing its economy is the comfort people need before starting a family, he says.\n\n\u2026 but also other factors\n\nRecent data from the UK Generations and Gender Survey tells us that the ideal family size remains relatively high, with an average of about two children. There remains evidence of a two-child family ideal.\n\nBerrington says that when her team asked childless people whether they intend to have children, there was \u201ca lot of uncertainty in the answers\u201d. Higher proportions of young adults said they probably or definitely would not have children, as compared with the proportions reported by millennials at a similar age.\n\nFiona Powley, 49, a life coach, knew she did not want children by the age of 12, and knows many contemporaries who also prefer to be child-free; she runs the group Bristol Childfree Women. As an indication of the problem faced by any government seeking to boost fertility, she says that when she asks people as they join her community what they enjoy most about being child-free, \u201cthey talk about time and freedom: finances don\u2019t usually feature\u201d.\n\nShe adds: \u201cA common judgment from others asks \u2018who will look after you when you\u2019re old?\u2019, to which most members might say they\u2019ve made good financial provision for older-age care and pensions as they\u2019ve not have the financial strain of children.\u201d\n\nSarah Harper, a professor of gerontology at Oxford University, says one of the main issues is equality, meaning equal treatment by the state and within a relationship.\n\nskip past newsletter promotion Sign up to Observed Free weekly newsletter Analysis and opinion on the week's news and culture brought to you by the best Observer writers Enter your email address Sign up Privacy Notice: Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

However, it might explain why traditional South Korea\u2019s fertility rate is so low.\n\n\u201cThese days women say they have no obligation to reproduce and \u2018I\u2019m not going to have a baby who turns my life upside down\u2019,\u201d says Harper, who advised the David Cameron\u2019s government on the implications of an ageing society.\n\nPublic services\n\nThe Treasury\u2019s independent forecaster, the Office for Budget Responsibility (OBR), says falling birthrates are going to have a negative effect on tax receipts. That is a situation that is not necessarily solved by higher immigration.\n\nIn a recent report, it said that while every additional migrant generally boosts the level of output in the economy, \u201cthe size of this impact and the effect on per-person living standards is highly uncertain.\n\n\u201cThe age, education, skill level, and participation rate of migrants, alongside the investment response of businesses, are all factors that determine the impact of migration on per-person output,\u201d it said.\n\nAt the moment, the UK population is increasing \u2013 by an estimated 6.6 million to 73.7 million over the next 15 years \u2013 but the economy is on course to grow at a slower pace, meaning there is less of the financial pie to go around.\n\nWithout a healthy rise in tax receipts, governments will struggle to pay for vital services.\n\nSchools are in the frontline of cuts as pupil numbers decline, according to the Resolution Foundation. In England, they could lose up to \u00a31bn in funding by 2030, with exceptional falls in pupil numbers prompting closures as some establishments cease to be financially viable. Councils across the country have begun to consult local residents about mergers and closures to make the system viable.\n\nAccording to the Education Policy Institute (EPI), a thinktank, the north-east is projected to see the greatest decline in primary pupil numbers, down 13% by 2028-29.\n\nPrimary school teachers could face redundancy, such is the dramatic loss of young children, says Lindsey Macmillan, an education policy expert at University College London. She says secondary schools that are now suffering teacher shortages will see the gap close as classes are cut and schools merged.\n\nPupil numbers had grown because of a fertility surge in the 00s, but that cohort has moved through primary and on to secondaries, leaving empty seats in their wake.\n\nLooking ahead, even with real terms increases in per-pupil funding over the remainder of the decade, the EPI predicts that many schools will suffer funding cuts due to fewer pupils causing income to fall, though costs will remain high.\n\nWhat about ageing?\n\nPlenty of questions arise over the fact that the birthrate is falling while medical improvements are helping older people live longer. Will robots be able to look after elderly people? Could a new social contract between young and old give millennials and gen Z the security and encouragement they need to have more children? And can the UK import all the missing labour it needs, such as from sub-Saharan Africa, where births are expected to be higher?\n\nNik Lomax, a professor of population geography at Leeds University, says one problem faced by the next government will be how different regions are affected.\n\n\u201cOne way of thinking about the implications of this is to assess the old-age dependency ratio \u2013 the number of people of retirement age for every 1,000 people of working age,\u201d he says. \u201cThis reveals striking differences by geography, and will get larger over time as the number of old people relative to working age people increases.\u201d\n\nJust as fertility rates are falling fastest in the north-east, Wales, the south-west and parts of the Midlands, the dependency ratio is increasing in these regions too.\n\nHarper says a clear trend shows fewer people entering the workforce and older people living longer, and not necessarily in good health.\n\n\u201cMen in areas that rank in the lowest third by average incomes will live until they are 80, but spend their 70s in ill health,\u201d she says. \u201cMen who live in the top third of affluent areas will live until their late 80s and won\u2019t be ill or have a disability, on average, until they are 80.\u201d\n\nHarper says the Cameron government put ageing into its industrial strategy and considered many of the implications of falling birthrates and rising levels of ill health among a growing number of over-65s. But the industrial strategy and policy initiatives were later jettisoned.\n\nGiven that we are not going to change the dynamics of fertility rates and have women go back to producing three to four children, we need to extend people\u2019s lives in a healthy way, Harper says.\n\nBerrington says the implications for policymaking are \u201cvery significant \u2013 for example, the short-term decline in demand for childcare, maternity services and other parts of the economy that depend on people buying goods and services for children. \u201cPolicy responses to low fertility have tended to focus on ways to increase fertility,\u201d she says. \u201cHowever, many pronatalist policies do not work, especially cash benefits, as they tend to just bring forward in time births that would happen anyway, and not increase the overall number of births.\u201d\n\nPronatalist policies \u2013 those that attempt to boost the birthrate \u2013 are also often problematic in terms of entrenching gender inequality and reducing reproductive freedom.\n\nA report by the Social Market Foundation thinktank in 2021 said the tens of billions of pounds it would take to support an expansion of family welfare could be better spent. \u201cWe do not recommend that the government pursues a distinct \u2018population strategy\u2019 to increase the birthrate. However, the government should convene a cross-departmental working group to examine how different policies affect the birthrate,\u201d it said.\n\nBerrington says healthy ageing is crucial to the prospects for the economy, providing more workers and helping fill the state\u2019s coffers.\n\n\u201cAnd governments will need to look to other policy solutions, such as increasing employment among groups which for different reasons \u2013 poor mental wellbeing, or because they have young children \u2013 have relatively high inactivity rates.\u201d",
        "summary": "These factors have led to a sharp fall in fertility rates \u2013 the number of children born to each woman.\nWhile the issues facing governments from rapidly ageing populations are relatively familiar, a decline in fertility rates that was once limited to Japan has spread across the world.\nJapan\u2019s fertility rate is 1.3, just ahead of Italy\u2019s 1.2 and South Korea\u2019s 0.8.\nHowever, it might explain why traditional South Korea\u2019s fertility rate is so low.\nPlenty of questions arise over the fact that the birthrate is falling while medical improvements are helping older people live longer.",

        "title": "Labour needs billions to fund its plans \u2013 and I know where it can be found | Will Hutton",
        "body": "Since its foundation in 1900, the Labour party has had a Janus-headed attitude to capitalism. It needs capitalism to be successful, dynamic and job creating, even while it instinctively distrusts capitalism, with its capacity to generate extreme inequality, invest too little, cut corners and treat workers exploitatively. But its past efforts at improving things \u2013 nationalisation, top-down planning, championing strong trade unions or simply (as New Labour did) largely giving capitalism its head \u2013 have not been notably successful. It has been a standoff that the Conservative party has ruthlessly exploited.\n\nThe seismic importance of 4 July is that Conservatism\u2019s approach to wealth generation \u2013 trying to shrink the state whose size and excess taxes supposedly \u201ccrowds out\u201d suppressed investment and enterprise \u2013 is exposed as a dead end of stagnant living standards and eviscerated public services. Keir Starmer, boxed in by this dreadful legacy, has declared that Labour will become the party of growth and wealth generation. Only thus can sustained tax revenues be generated to repair the ravages of the past 14 years. My bet is that he has a better than even chance of pulling it off \u2013 and transforming Labour into Britain\u2019s natural party of government.\n\nHis first advantage is that the economic evidence is unambiguous: the state does not \u201ccrowd out\u201d investment, and low taxes do little to stimulate enterprise. What capitalism needs from the state is well-designed and stable policy that proactively manages the business cycle while \u201ccrowding in\u201d innovation, infrastructure and abundant fit-for-purpose training, and shapes the savings system to deliver buoyant company share prices \u2013 the necessary if insufficient precondition for raising capital to enable higher investment and a startup and scale-up boom.\n\nThis is becoming the new common sense in business, finance and the financial markets. It is why investors are buying shares anticipating a Labour government, and why Dame Amanda Blanc, CEO of Aviva, suggested last week that there could be as much as \u00a3100bn from UK insurers ready to flow into business investment if chancellor Rachel Reeves can deliver her promises on stability. That alone would go some way to lift British public and private investment by \u00a3100bn every year \u2013 the scale of the gap between us and our major competitors \u2013 while not risking another Liz Truss-style fiasco.\n\nOne important avenue to growth, cited in the Labour manifesto, is the prospect of unleashing some of the \u00a31.4tn funds fossilised in Britain\u2019s 5,100 defined benefit pension fund schemes. Linked to a generous fraction of workers\u2019 final year\u2019s pay, they have become a financial burden. To wind them up, companies have closed them to new members, creating a \u00a31.4tn universe of wholly risk-averse zombie funds. They need to be consolidated into bigger funds that can take risks \u2013 and the money made to work to accelerate Britain\u2019s investment recovery.\n\nThere is the tool to hand. One of the most startling policy successes of the past 20 years has been New Labour\u2019s Pension Protection Fund (PPF), established in 2005, which takes over the management of distressed defined benefit pension funds, guaranteeing the future pensions. Managed with great professionalism, the PPF has already consolidated more than 1,100 pension funds and is currently worth \u00a333bn with a \u00a312bn investment surplus \u2013 one of the most successful funds of its type globally in securing high investment performance. Industry insiders believe that there is another \u00a3600bn locked up in small, high-cost zombie funds that could be liberated for productive investment.\n\nThe first staging post would be to scale up the current PPF to at least \u00a3100bn. Conservative objections that this would leave the pension funds with no fiscal backstop can be easily overcome; backed by the state, the PPF will become the new backstop via a guarantee that does not score as public borrowing. Nor, because the PPF is so rich, would the state ever be at risk. Reeves will be on her way.\n\nskip past newsletter promotion Sign up to Observed Free weekly newsletter Analysis and opinion on the week's news and culture brought to you by the best Observer writers Enter your email address Sign up Privacy Notice: Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Reeves should lift the facility to \u00a350bn. A similar guarantee would enable the British Business Bank (BBB) to offer venture debt to startups and scale-ups, and seek out promising companies to back: there is an estimated annual shortage of up to \u00a310bn of venture lending that needs to be closed. My understanding is that a scaled-up PPF would support both the UKIB and BBB; at a stroke, Britain would have equipped itself with an investment trio of financial institutions dedicated to serious multibillion-pound economic development and resultant growth \u2013 without additional direct government borrowing. It\u2019s a fiscal get-out-of-jail-free card.\n\nAgainst this background, Reeves can use her proposed rewriting of the fiscal rules to supplement public investment directly. The Financial Times recently reported that asset managers would buy an extra \u00a320bn-\u00a330bn of government debt if it were earmarked for investment projects and R&D. Altogether, the UK\u2019s growth rate could accelerate to above 2.5% by the end of the parliament, with even the dropped \u00a328bn target for green spending met. Growth would be higher again the more Britain regained access to lost EU markets.\n\nIn the near future, before growth kicks in, Starmer and Reeves may have to increase the current yields from capital gains, inheritance and council tax by up to another 1% of GDP. But overall there will be the funds to resuscitate education, the NHS, local government, defence, the criminal justice system, the arts and welfare. Do I dream? Some commitments are in the manifesto, others set out in Reeves\u2019 Mais lecture in March, others have not been excluded during the election campaign, and the ambitious teams in the investment trio are all standing by for the call.\n\nSome in the Treasury will oppose. And never underestimate the conservatism and parochialism of the pension fund world. Geopolitics may kill all hopes. But Britain under Labour could at last fulfil its economic promise and build a high-investment, inclusive, high-wage capitalism that treats its workers fairly. This time, no mistakes.",

        "body": "To the stirring strains of the Marseillaise, a monochrome Angela Rayner reels off her plans for workers\u2019 rights, as a red beret and a Gallic moustache jiggle around her head. \u201cAngela Rayner\u2019s Britain?\u201d demands the title, alongside a tiny tricolour.\n\nTory messaging has become ever more bizarre as this gaffe-strewn campaign lurches towards a close, but Thursday\u2019s example, warning that Labour may make the UK\u2019s labour market un peu French, hit new heights of weirdness.\n\nFor one thing, the mention of France seems more likely to evoke pleasant holidays than picket lines. More importantly, polling suggests the policies Rayner set out in the clip \u2013 employment rights from day one of a job, banning fire and rehire, binning bogus self-employment \u2013 are popular with the public.\n\nRecent TUC polling found that two-thirds of people supported employees having the right to unfair dismissal from day one \u2013 including 61% of 2019 Tory voters. Similarly, two-thirds were in favour of a ban on fire and rehire.\n\nTwo things probably underlie the groundswell of opinion that tougher rules are needed in the labour market. One is the plain fact that too many people have found themselves working hard and still un\u00adable to make ends meet. Real wage growth has been all but stagnant for the best part of 15 years, with average earnings a pathetic \u00a316 a week higher than in 2010 \u2013 despite significant increases in the minimum wage (rebranded as the \u201cnational living wage\u201d) under successive Conservative governments.\n\nAgainst that backdrop, it is hardly surprising some feel the balance has tipped too far from workers to employers \u2013 a sentiment that perhaps also partly explains the \u00adsupport for public sector strikes last year.\n\nIt is more than that, however: there is a sense not just of a lack of bargaining power, but of unfairness, injustice even, in the way the labour market works for those trapped at the bottom.\n\nFrom \u201cself-employed\u201d gig economy workers summarily laid off via an app to social care staff exploited by rogue employers and shift workers unable to plan childcare because of last-minute changes, there is an infuriating impotence about so many people\u2019s interactions with the labour market. That is only likely to increase as new technologies are used to monitor and even manage workers as they go about their jobs.\n\nIn theory, Labour\u2019s new deal for working people should help to turn the tide, particularly when combined with the tougher approach to enforcement Rayner has promised.\n\nSocial care is set to be the testing ground for a new approach of \u201cfair pay agreements\u201d under which employers and unions will have to hammer out terms and conditions that ministers will then apply across the sector.\n\nUnions will be given the right to enter workplaces and make the case for membership \u2013 something the GMB has only just won at Amazon\u2019s Coventry warehouse under strict conditions as part of a statutory ballot. And a new Labour government would consult about establishing a single employment status, abolishing the halfway house of \u201cworker\u201d, which comes with more obligations than rights.\n\nAs with so many areas of Labour\u2019s agenda, however, the details will be critical \u2013 as will timing. Fair pay agreements were introduced in New Zealand in 2022, but implementation took so long that not a single one had come into force before the government changed and the plan was scrapped.\n\nskip past newsletter promotion Sign up to Observed Free weekly newsletter Analysis and opinion on the week's news and culture brought to you by the best Observer writers Enter your email address Sign up Privacy Notice: Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

It is worth stressing how far away the UK is from that at present: Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development data suggests that 26% of workers here are covered by collective bargaining, for example, compared with 100% in Italy, 98% in France and 54% in Germany.\n\nRegulation of the labour market has the potential to change millions of people\u2019s lives for the better\n\nBut Soames\u2019s concerns will find an echo among some in Labour. Furious unions confronted the party earlier this year over what they saw as an effort to undermine the new deal for workers \u2013 with union insiders claiming the shadow chancellor, Rachel Reeves, was keen to burnish her business credentials by being seen to push back against the plans. A fragile peace broke out after a face-to-face meeting between union general secretaries and shadow cabinet members, including Keir Starmer, but much about the fine details will only become clear the other side of the election.\n\nThe necessity to regain business backing has been a key part of Labour\u2019s plan to win Thursday\u2019s vote. If it succeeds, as polls suggest, the question facing the party on Friday will be a very different one: how to wield that power?\n\nRegulation of the labour market is knotty, unglamorous and the subject of intense lobbying, but it has the potential to change millions of people\u2019s lives for the better. Rayner should embrace the beret, face down the doubters and be bold.",

The revision suggests that real GDP growth in 2024 as a whole may be more likely to come in a bit above our existing forecast of 1.0%.\n\nDales adds:\n\nIt now looks as though real household disposable income will grow by more than our forecast of 2.0% this year and we are expecting a solid 3.5% gain next year too.

        "body": "The UK economy grew at a faster rate than previously thought in the first quarter of 2024, handing the next prime minister an improved economic backdrop.\n\nGross domestic product (GDP) rose by 0.7% in the first three months of 2024, revised upwards by the Office for National Statistics from a first estimate of 0.6%.\n\nThe first-quarter figures were lifted by growth in the services sector, up by 0.8%, as well as the production sector, which expanded by 0.6%, although that was revised down from 0.8% in the initial estimate. Other areas of the economy fared less well, with bad weather hampering the construction sector, where output fell by 0.6%.\n\nThe data confirmed that the UK was the fastest-growing economy in the G7 during the first quarter after a short recession in the second half of last year.\n\nReal household disposable income \u2013 how much each home is left with after tax, adjusted for inflation \u2013 is estimated to have increased by 0.7% in the first quarter of this year, matching the growth in the final quarter of 2023, according to the ONS.\n\nThe strength of the economy has been a big issue in the general election campaign after voters suffered a squeeze from higher inflation and increased mortgage rates over the past three years.\n\nRishi Sunak has insisted that the UK economy has turned a corner but the latest encouraging data comes less than a week before polling day.\n\nThe Resolution Foundation thinktank said living standards \u2013 as measured by real household disposable income per head \u2013 were up by 2.4% as a result of pay rising faster than prices.\n\nDespite the improvement as cost of living pressures have eased, living standards over the 2019-24 parliament as a whole fell by 0.6%, leaving the average person \u00a3120 a year worse off than they were at the time of the last election.\n\nAdam Corlett, the thinktank\u2019s principal economist, said it was only the third time since the first world war that living standards had been lower at the end of a parliament than at the start.\n\nThe UK economy showed no growth in April, with an increase in the services sector offset by falls in production and construction after heavy rain hampered building work and deterred shoppers from spending on the high street.\n\nHowever, more recent figures show consumer confidence is returning \u2013 bolstered by falling inflation and stronger retail sales. UK inflation fell to 2% in May returning to the official target rate for the first time in nearly three years. Figures released last week showed retail sales bounced back with 2.9% growth in May after a weather-affected drop of 1.8% the previous month.\n\nskip past newsletter promotion Sign up to Business Today Free daily newsletter Get set for the working day \u2013 we'll point you to all the business news and analysis you need every morning Enter your email address Sign up Privacy Notice: Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

        "body": "View image in fullscreen Composite: Guardian Design Team/Getty\n\nUnless the polls are wildly inaccurate, the Conservative party is heading towards a catastrophic defeat in the coming election.\n\nAll across the rich world, voters are angry at their governments \u2013 they blame politicians for a burst of inflation that happened almost everywhere and is now subsiding almost everywhere, including in the UK. But the Conservatives deserve defeat more than most: they took power 14 years ago promising to deliver responsible policies and economic success. Instead they have presided over economic stagnation and a collapse in public services.\n\nWhy has Conservative governance gone so badly? It is natural to blame Brexit, which did indeed increase trade frictions and therefore surely had a negative effect on British real income. However, Brexit has not had the disastrous effects some predicted, and has somewhat perversely led to a rise rather than a fall in immigration, especially of the highly skilled.\n\nIn fact, the roots of Britain\u2019s poor economic performance are older and deeper than Brexit. Though many bad decisions undoubtedly contributed, one central cause was the way David Cameron and George Osborne gratuitously embraced fiscal austerity when they came to power after the global financial crisis.\n\nAt the time, this looked like an obvious macroeconomic error; more than a decade later, it has become a social and political catastrophe.\n\nLet us recall the circumstances when the Conservatives took power. The financial crisis had produced a severe global recession; by 2010 the world economy was growing again, but all major economies, Britain included, were still operating far below capacity and had high unemployment.\n\nTextbook economics tells us that when unemployment is high and inflation is low, governments should try to stimulate demand with reduced interest rates and fiscal deficits. Interest cuts were not an option because rates were already close to zero, so the indicated policy was fiscal stimulus.\n\nYet the Cameron government chose to do the opposite, pulling back fiscal support from an economy that still needed it badly. Britain was not the only nation turning to fiscal austerity in the face of high unemployment \u2013 Greece engaged in savage austerity, while Portugal, Spain, Italy and Ireland made large cuts, and fiscal policy in the US also turned contractionary.\n\nWhat made the British case unique was that it was almost entirely an unforced error. Southern European austerity was a response to pressure from the bond markets: Greece was in effect cut off from private markets, while other nations faced sharply increased borrowing costs, becoming dependent on official lenders who insisted on budget cuts as a condition for loans. Bond buyers never lost faith in the US, but after 2010 Barack Obama faced a deeply hostile Congress, which in effect blackmailed him into spending cuts by threatening to provoke a government default.\n\nWhile Britain had low borrowing costs like the US, its government was not divided. The Cameron executive could have chosen to maintain spending. Why did it turn to austerity?\n\nPart of the answer is that policymakers were genuinely spooked by the sudden emergence of the crisis in Greece. Until Greece hit the wall, debt crises were generally thought of as a problem that happened only in poorer nations. It is understandable that many observers, at least initially, wondered if the Greek crisis was the leading edge of a broader attack by bond vigilantes.\n\nBut UK debt was clearly far smaller relative to the economy than Greece\u2019s \u2013 and it became obvious early on that contagion from the Greek debt crisis was restricted to eurozone nations. So there was no reason to continue believing that the UK risked \u201cbecoming Greece\u201d, as many politicians recklessly claimed at the time.\n\nIn fact, it soon became clear that even the eurozone crisis was more a matter of market panic than one of fundamentally unsustainable levels of debt. As the economist Paul De Grauwe has said, nations with debts in another country\u2019s currency can suffer something similar to a bank run: panicked investors seeking to pull out their funds can cause a government to run out of cash, forcing it into default. Nations that borrow in their own currency are not vulnerable to such a self-fulfilling crisis, because they can in effect print money in a crunch.\n\nThis analysis was validated in 2012 when Mario Draghi, the president of the European Central Bank (ECB), said three words: \u201cWhatever it takes.\u201d This was taken to mean that the ECB would, if necessary, supply cash to governments facing a market panic. And suddenly the euro \u201cdebt\u201d crisis faded away, with investors demanding much lower interest rates on the debt of Italy, Spain and so on.\n\nSince Britain has not adopted the euro and had debts in its own currency, it was not vulnerable to this kind of cash crisis.\n\nThe bottom line is that there was no pressing economic need to slash spending in the face of high unemployment. I would argue that the best way to explain Britain\u2019s austerity is not economic but sociological.\n\nSociology? I used to talk about the push for austerity being led by Very Serious People (a term I borrowed from the blogger Duncan Black). This was not really a joke: if you spend any time consorting with members of the global policy elite, you realise that many of them are driven primarily by the desire to appear \u201cserious\u201d. In economic terms, this usually means pushing policies that will cause significant hardship \u2013 to other people, of course.\n\nThe obsession with perceived seriousness reflects peer pressure, but in some ways also reflects personal careerism. Officials in democratic nations cannot expect to remain in office for more than a few years. What do they do next? If they have lobbied for \u201cserious\u201d policies, they can have a bright future giving speeches at Davos about the importance of making \u201ctough choices\u201d. Or they might even end up employed by the financial industry to lobby their former colleagues \u2013 where a reputation for \u201cseriousness\u201d is a prerequisite, no matter how much damage those policies have caused. (Indeed, Osborne has done both.)\n\nSociology partly explains the Conservative embrace of austerity. But there was also political calculation. Denunciations of debt and deficits often go hand in hand with demands for smaller government, in particular a shrunken welfare state. In effect, politicians whose real goal is to move policy to the right exploit fear of deficits to push an agenda that would be deeply unpopular if stated openly. The Oxford economist Simon Wren-Lewis calls this the \u201cdeficit deceit\u201d hypothesis. The deceit aspect is especially obvious in the US, where Republican leaders routinely denounce deficits while pushing for budget-busting tax cuts. But there is every reason to believe that the same kind of cynicism played an important role in UK austerity.\n\nIt turns out, however, that exploiting debt fears to engineer cuts in public spending tends not to work out quite the way that small-government advocates hope.\n\nWhat serious conservatives \u2013 they do exist \u2013 want is a less generous social safety net, with fewer income transfers to households, while governments concentrate on those functions that only government can perform. I do not share that desire, but never mind. What is important is that voters do not share that desire: cutting direct financial aid is deeply unpopular.\n\nWhat does this have to do with deficit deceit? Even when a government manages to build support for spending cuts by scaring the public about debt and deficits, it generally finds itself shying away from spending cuts that will directly affect families\u2019 incomes. Instead, it tries to save money by shortchanging public investment and public services, a strategy that seems preferable because the consequences of these spending cuts may not be all that visible in the short run.\n\nBut the effects of inadequate public investment cumulate over time, so that a fiscal strategy advertised as an exercise in responsibility ends up being deeply irresponsible, leading to crumbling infrastructure and deteriorating public services. This is how Cameron and Osborne\u2019s error has compounded over the past decade.\n\nConsider the NHS. I am clearly not an expert on the system, and I am sure that the NHS\u2019s problems have multiple causes. But it is obvious to an outsider that direct public provision of healthcare, while it has major advantages, creates a special form of political vulnerability.\n\nCompare the NHS with single-payer systems \u2013 including Medicare, which serves older Americans \u2013 in which the government pays the bills but does not employ the doctors or operate the hospitals. An attempt to save money by underfunding Medicare would provoke an immediate public outcry \u2013 in fact, false rumours of such a move created an outcry in 2010. But a government can underfund the NHS for years before the consequences become obvious to voters, and by that time the crisis can be very hard to fix.\n\nTo sum up: a decade ago, the main critique of austerity was macroeconomic \u2013 it was holding back recovery from the severe recession that followed the global financial crisis. And it did. But that was not the end of the story. Austerity also gradually undermined public services, including healthcare.\n\nWhat will a Labour government do to reverse this damage? There are two reasons to worry it will fall short.\n\nFirst, the era of Conservative austerity coincided with an era of low interest rates and substantial excess capacity, exactly the conditions under which Britain should have been investing in its future. The current environment is much less favourable.\n\nSecond, Labour\u2019s stated plans lack any ambition to reverse austerity. In the US, the Biden administration came in with bold plans and managed to accomplish a significant fraction of them despite having only a razor-thin congressional majority. I am not hearing anything comparable from Labour, even though Keir Starmer seems on course to have political capital beyond the wildest dreams of US progressives.\n\nI hope to be proved wrong. But right now it looks as though the shadow of austerity policies adopted in error 14 years ago will continue to darken Britain\u2019s prospects for many years to come.",

The National Rally exceeded expectations and may yet pick up the second-round votes for a relative or even absolute majority.\n\n\u201cIntense horse trading until Tuesday evening will likely see deals cut between the left and centre parties to try to derail this.\u201d\n\nOn Friday, the gap between the interest rate (yield) on French and German bonds had widened to its highest since the eurozone debt crisis in 2012, but the spread narrowed slightly from 0.85 percentage points to 0.75 points after the results came in. The gap was less than 0.5 points before the snap election was called.\n\nKrishna Guha, an analyst at the US investment bank Evercore, said: \u201cThe vote is far from definitive but leans in favour of the less bad scenario of a hung parliament, political paralysis in Paris and chronic dysfunction at the EU level rather than the worse scenarios of an outright win for the far right or far left that might directly lead to a new European sovereign crisis.\u201d\n\nskip past newsletter promotion Sign up to Business Today Free daily newsletter Get set for the working day \u2013 we'll point you to all the business news and analysis you need every morning Enter your email address Sign up Privacy Notice: Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

        "body": "A human rights group has urged Britain\u2019s financial regulator to block the Chinese fast-fashion retailer Shein\u2019s planned blockbuster flotation on the London Stock Exchange.\n\nStop Uyghur Genocide, a UK-based human rights charity that alleges minority Uyghur people are being used as forced labour at some of Shein\u2019s cotton suppliers in China\u2019s north-western Xinjiang region, has begun a legal campaign against the planned stock market listing.\n\nRepresented by the law firm Leigh Day, the campaign group has written to the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) to argue that \u201cany attempt by Shein to list on the LSE should be refused\u201d.\n\nThe China-founded company, which was valued at $66bn (\u00a352bn) in a fundraising round last year, began to explore a listing on the LSE early this year, and is expected to file a prospectus with the UK regulator soon. Shein abandoned its original plan to list in New York after opposition from US politicians.\n\nOn Tuesday, Amnesty International UK said Shein\u2019s potential London listing would be a \u201cbadge of shame\u201d for the London market because of the fast-fashion firm\u2019s \u201cquestionable\u201d labour and human rights standards.\n\nThe fast-fashion retailer said on Wednesday: \u201cShein has a zero-tolerance policy for forced labour and we are committed to respecting human rights. We take visibility across our entire supply chain seriously and we require our contract manufacturers to only source cotton from approved regions.\u201d\n\nStop Uyghur Genocide said it had reminded the FCA that its US counterpart, the Securities and Exchange Commission, has already refused to recommend the listing of Shein for trading on the US stock exchange because of concerns around labour practices in the company\u2019s supply chains.\n\nThe group said the London listing should not be allowed to go ahead because the UK has signed up to International Labour Organization conventions, which set out minimum standards for engaging workers. Any concerns about companies engaging workers in their supply chains that may breach those minimum standards are inconsistent with the UK\u2019s convention obligations, it said.\n\n\u201cThe FCA has a statutory duty of integrity and to protect its investors,\u201d the group added.\n\nThe Leigh Day solicitor Ricardo Gama, who represents Stop Uyghur Genocide, said: \u201cStop Uyghur Genocide expects UK financial institutions to uphold the high ethical standards that they pay lip service to, and to make clear that London isn\u2019t the place to come for a \u2018no questions asked\u2019 approach to capital. At the very minimum regulators must make sure that laws in place to root out modern slavery are complied with.\u201d\n\nStop Uyghur Genocide said it was concerned about the London Stock Exchange\u2019s ability to detect and respond to any alleged forced labour in Shein\u2019s supply chains.\n\nStop Uyghur Genocide is preparing a detailed submission to the regulator to support its letter.\n\nIn the meantime, the campaign group\u2019s lawyers have asked the FCA to obtain more information from Shein about the \u201caccuracy of its published modern slavery statement\u201d.\n\n\n\nUnder the Modern Slavery Act, large businesses have to publish a statement every year that sets out the measures they have taken to ensure slavery and trafficking do not occur in their own operations and their supply chains.\n\nskip past newsletter promotion Sign up to Business Today Free daily newsletter Get set for the working day \u2013 we'll point you to all the business news and analysis you need every morning Enter your email address Sign up Privacy Notice: Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

It noted that it has no investigation or enforcement powers relating to alleged breaches of legislation not within its remit, such as the Modern Slavery Act or tax legislation.\n\nBefore a company\u2019s shares can be admitted to the LSE, the firm must apply to the FCA for admission to listing and to approve its prospectus. The watchdog said it was the company\u2019s responsibility to ensure the information in its prospectus is accurate, and not the FCA\u2019s role to independently verify the accurate of information.\n\nMichael Polak, barrister and chair of Lawyers for Uyghur Rights, said: \u201cA firm alleged to have involvement in goods directly produced by slave labour in the Uyghur region creates a risk that those vital principles will be violated. We will ask the FCA to consider the expert evidence that we will provide to them before deciding on a public listing in the UK.\u201d",

        "body": "From 7d ago 10.52 CEST LGIM's ESG funds to divest from Glencore on concern over thermal coal plans Investment management giant Legal & General\u2019s ESG (environmental, social and governance) funds, and some of its pension funds, are to divest from Glencore due to concerns over its coal production. LGIM warns this morning that it believes companies need to do more to play their part in efforts to mitigate climate change risks. UPDATE: It will divest Glencore shares held in its Future World fund range, LGIM\u2019s ESG fund ranges, and all defined contribution (DC) auto-enrolment default funds in L&G Workplace Pensions and the L&G Mastertrust. The decision applies to funds covering around \u00a3176bn in assets under management. Glencore, which is the world\u2019s biggest coal shipper, is \u201cphasing down\u201d its coal portfolio, as part of a plan to only achieve net zero emissions by the middle of the century. That means some existing coalmines would run until 2050, despite concerns about the pollution caused by thermal coal. \u2018Largest ever\u2019 NSW coalmine plan will put pressure on state\u2019s net zero target, watchdog says Read more Legal & General says: \u201cLGIM remains concerned that Glencore has not disclosed plans for thermal coal production that are aligned with a net zero pathway.\u201d LGIM are the 22nd largest Glencore investor overall, according to data from LSEG, with 0.44% of the company\u2019s shares. Share Updated at 13.01 CEST\n\n7d ago 16.42 CEST Back in the UK, the Czech billionaire hoping to buy Royal Mail has confirmed he is considering offering employees a stake in the business, as his company asked shareholders to back its \u00a33.6 billion takeover bid. As flagged this morning, Daniel Kretinsky\u2019s EP Group set out its plans for the future of Royal Mail\u2019s owner, International Distribution Services (IDS), in a letter sent to shareholders. In the offer letter, EP Group said it is \u201cexploring, following completion of the acquisition, potentially offering a form of employee participation model in the business\u201d which could include \u201cprofit-sharing\u201d among all members of staff. Unions representing postal workers have previously called for staff to be given a stake in the company via a shake-up of its structure. Share\n\n7d ago 16.25 CEST US new home sales fell in May Sales of new US single-family homes dropped to a six-month low last month,new data from the Commerce Department shows. New home sales declined 11.3% to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 619,000 units last month, the lowest level since November. This indicates that high mortgage rates are hurting demand, weakening the housing market.

Volkswagen will initially invest $1bn as part of a partnership with Rivian to form a new, equally controlled joint venture to share electric vehicle architecture and software, the companies said on Tuesday. The deal is a significant win for Rivian, which is grappling with steep losses as it attempts to ramp up production of its electric trucks and sport utility vehicles. While EV startups have been dealing with a slowdown in demand amid high interest rates and dwindling cash, traditional automakers have struggled to build battery-powered vehicles and advanced software. Shares in Rivian\u2019s stock have jumped by 30% in early New York trading, from $11.96 to $15.47, following yesterday\u2019s announcement.

Today\u2019s report says: The eurozone has exited the recent manufacturing recession, putting it cyclically ahead of the U.S. Meanwhile, the labor market continues to slow although the unemployment rate remains near all-time lows. Southern Europe (Spain and Italy) continues to outperform Northern Europe (Germany) not only due to a prevalence of services, but also a rise in productivity in the case of Spain. Recent slower growth at the eurozone level reflects in part a faster passthrough of monetary policy, which has led to weaker inflation pressures. Share\n\n7d ago 14.56 CEST S&P Global have raised their forecast for the UK economy this year. They now expect UK GDP to rise by 0.6% this year, up from a previous forecast of 0.3%. Chief economist Paul Gruenwald says \u201cthe recovery in services in the first quarter has been stronger than expected\u201d in the UK. However, the UK growth forecast in 2025 has been trimmed to 1.2%, from 1.4%. Spain\u2019s growth forecast has also been revised up, to 2.2% in 2024 from 1.8%. This is to reflect \u201crobust household balance sheets and rapid disinflation\u201d, Gruenwald explains. Share\n\n7d ago 14.35 CEST S&P Global: soft-landing narrative remains valid The global economy remain on track for a soft landing, as central banks start to lower interest rates followin recent falls in inflation. So says credit rating agency S&P Global, in its latest global economic update. S&P Global is still optimistic that policymakers will pull off a \u2018soft landing\u2019 \u2013 bringing down inflation without triggering a recession. It explains: GDP growth has moderated in most economies (the U.S. remains an outlier) and recessions have been avoided. Demand pressures have come down, bringing inflation back toward target. Services demand and employment remain robust, moderating the speed of decline, and bolstering the probability of a soft landing. S&P Global argues that central banks have reached \u201cthe beginning of the end-game\u201d, as some \u2013 such as the Bank of Canada, the Swiss National Bank and the European Central Bank \u2013 have recently started cutting interest rates in response to falling inflation. Although inflation has been stickier than hoped, S&P Global argues this is \u201cjust the flipside\u201d of resilient spending and strong jobs markets, and compatible with a soft landing. They say: A recession with a sharp drop in employment and labor demand would likely produce a faster decline in inflation, but is that what we really want?

Yeterday, a judge found that Dominic Chappell had sought to \u201cplunder\u201d the UK department store chain, which collapsed in 2016. Mr Justice Leech said Chappell had agreed to purchase BHS without \u201cany prospect\u201d of obtaining working capital to meet its day-to-day financial needs. He then took the \u201copportunity to plunder the BHS Group as and when he could\u201d, the judge explained. The Financial Times has more details: At a hearing on Tuesday, the judge said Chappell \u201cshould make the payments\u201d set out in a draft order. A copy of the order, seen by the Financial Times, shows the sums include \u00a321.5m for a wrongful trading claim, \u00a317.5m for breach of fiduciary duty, plus costs and interest, totalling at least \u00a350m.

The CBI\u2019s latest healthcheck on UK retailers, just released, found that retail sales volumes fell in the year to June, following a modest recovery in May. The CBI\u2019s retail sales volume gauge fell to -24% this month, from +8% in May, showing that a majority of retailers reported a drop in volumes compared to the previous year.

Sales volumes are expected to remain below seasonal norms in July, albeit to a lesser extent (-29%).\n\nOrders placed upon suppliers fell moderately in the year to June at a broadly similar pace to last month (-14% from -11% in May). Retailers expect the cutback in orders to continue next month (-16%). Alpesh Paleja, CBI interim deputy chief economist, says: \u201cLast month\u2019s nascent recovery in sales proved to be short-lived, with retailers reporting a faster-than-anticipated decline this month. Unseasonably cold weather in June may have played a role, but it\u2019s notable that internet retail sales fell sharply in our survey, too. Consumer fundamentals are improving, with inflation now at the Bank of England\u2019s 2% target and real incomes rising. But it\u2019s clear that households are still struggling with the legacies of the cost-of-living crisis, with the level of prices still historically high in some areas. With consumer demand still on shaky ground, an incoming government can help business by ensuring that the UK is the most attractive place to start, grow and run a business. This will require bold action such as delivering a holistic cross-economy solution to the UK\u2019s overly complex business rates system, which is a particular burden for retailers. This would help to alleviate the burden of higher costs.\u201d Share\n\n7d ago 11.34 CEST LGIM will also divest from TJX Legal & General Investment Management has also decided to divest its stake in US retail chain TJX, the parent company of UK chain TK Maxx. LGIM says TJX, like Glencore, failed to sufficiently address concerns raised in recent years about its environmental impact. LGIM says it concerned over TJX\u2019s lack of a zero-deforestation policy and insufficient disclosure of \u201cmaterial Scope 3 emissions\u201d that fail to account for its material value chains\u2019 emissions. Today\u2019s decisions will raise the number of divestments through LGIM\u2019s Climate Impact Pledge to 16. LGIM says this \u201cstewardship\u201d of its investments is a critical lever in the global push to reach net zero. Stephen Beer, senior manager sustainability and responsible investment at Legal & General Investment Management, adds: We find that as time progresses, our conversations with companies can become harder-edged; not necessarily more difficult, but more focused. We use tools such as voting and divestment to encourage companies to meet our expectations on net-zero, while also sending a clear signal to the wider market. While divestment is one of the many stewardship tools we use as a mechanism for driving change, we see it as a last resort and by no means the last stage of engagement. Our engagement will continue, and where companies make sufficient progress, they will be reinstated. Ultimately, whilst we are focused on a net-zero objective, there is no one size fits all approach; our engagement approach is nuanced, it is about listening to companies and understanding the challenges they face, as well as the potential opportunities ahead, in accelerating the pace of the transition at a global scale.\u201d Share",

        "title": "The critical cog in Putin's machine and how British firms help to keep Russian gas flowing into Europe",
        "body": "This is the story of how an obscure company based in an office block on a quiet street in Glasgow became an accessory in Vladimir Putin's war on Ukraine. It is the story of how Europe and Russia remain locked in a tense relationship of economic dependence, even as they supposedly cut their ties. It is the story of the uncomfortable truth behind why the cost of living crisis came to an end.\n\nBut before all of that, it is the story of a ship - a very unusual ship indeed.\n\nIf you ever spot the Yakov Gakkel as it sails through the English Channel or the Irish Sea (I first set eyes on it in the Channel but at the time of writing it was sailing northwards, about 20 miles off the coast of Anglesey) you might not find it all that remarkable.\n\nAt first glance it looks like many of the other large, nondescript tankers and cargo vessels passing these shores. Its profile is dominated by an enormous blue prow which reaches high out of the water and ends, 50 metres further back, at its unexpectedly angular stern.\n\nYet the ship's slightly odd shape - all hull and barely any deck - is the first clue about what makes the Yakov Gakkel so special. Because this is one of the world's most advanced liquefied natural gas (LNG) tankers, with an unusual trick up its sleeve.\n\nImage: The Yakov Gakkel tanker\n\nLNG tankers are extraordinary ships, with insides so cleverly engineered they are capable of holding vast amounts of natural gas at temperatures of approximately \u2212163C.\n\nFor all that the world is embracing renewable energy, natural gas remains one of the most important energy sources, essential for much of Europe's heating and power, not to mention its industries. For the time being, there is no cheap way of making many industrial products, from glass and paper to critical chemicals and fertilisers, without gas.\n\nOnce upon a time, moving natural gas from one part of the world to another necessitated sending it down long, expensive, vulnerable pipelines, meaning only countries with a physical connection to gas producers could receive this vital fuel. But LNG tankers like the Yakov Gakkel are part of the answer to this problem, since they allow gas producers to send it by sea to anywhere with a terminal capable of turning their supercooled methane back into the gas we use to heat our homes and power our grids.\n\nImage: Politicians in Europe promised to end the continent's reliance on Russian gas\n\nBut the Yakov Gakkel can also do something most other LNG tankers cannot, for that enormous blue double hull allows it to carve through ice, enabling it to travel up into the Arctic Circle and back even in the depths of winter.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAnd that is precisely what this ship does, more or less constantly: travelling back and forth between Siberia and Europe, through winter and summer, bringing copious volumes of gas from Russia to Europe. It is part of the explanation for how Europe never ran out of gas, even after the Russian invasion of Ukraine.\n\nThis is not, it's worth saying, the conventional wisdom. Back when Russia invaded Ukraine, European policymakers declared they planned to eliminate the continent's reliance on Russian gas - which accounted for roughly a third of their supplies before 2022.\n\nAnd many assumed that had already happened - especially after the Nord Stream pipeline, the single biggest source of European gas imports, was sabotaged in late 2022. But while volumes of Russian pipeline gas into Europe have dropped dramatically, the amount of Russian LNG coming into Europe has risen to record levels.\n\nImage: LNG tankers sail between Siberia and various ports in Europe, including Zeebrugge\n\nRussia helps Europe replenish gas stores\n\nToday, Europe still depends on Russia for around 15% of its gas, an ever-growing proportion of which now comes in via the sealanes, on tankers like the Yakov Gakkel. And while the US has stepped in to make up some of the volumes lost when those pipelines stopped, only last month Russia overtook the US to become the second biggest provider of gas to the continent. It's further evidence that those LNG volumes carried on ships through the North Sea, the Irish Sea and the English Channel, are increasing, rather than falling.\n\nThis Russian gas has helped Europe replenish its gas stores, it has helped keep the continent's heavy industry going throughout the Ukraine war. And this dependence has not come cheap: the total amount Europe has paid Russia for LNG since 2022 comes to around \u20ac10bn.\n\nSpreaker Spreaker , which may be using cookies and other technologies.

Back then, many in the market were pricing in a complete end of Russian gas supply to Europe - something that would have had disastrous consequences. But it never actually happened.\n\nPerhaps this explains why the continent's politicians have, so far, stopped short of banning imports of Russian gas: they are aware that their economy would struggle to withstand another sharp spike in inflation - which would almost certainly eventuate if it stopped taking Russian gas altogether.\n\nImage: Russian gas has helped keep Europe's heavy industry going throughout the Ukraine war\n\nThis week, European leaders agreed to stop allowing Russia to use its ports to \"trans-ship\" its LNG - essentially acting as a stop-off point towards other destinations. However, those transshipments account for only a fraction - at most a quarter - of the Russian gas coming in on tankers to Europe. The vast majority ends up in Belgium, France and Spain, heating European homes, fuelling power stations and powering machinery in factories.\n\nWhile European leaders have imposed wide-ranging sanctions and price caps on shipments of oil, no such controls exist for liquefied natural gas. So the Yakov Gakkel and a fleet of LNG tankers carry on sailing between Siberia and various ports in Europe - Zeebrugge, Dunkirk, Montoir and Bilbao - keeping the continent supplied with the Russian hydrocarbons it still cannot live without.\n\nBritish firm's role in lucrative trade\n\nBut there is another reason why this ship is particularly unique, for the Yakov Gakkel - this critical cog in the financial machine that helps finance the Russian regime - is actually part-owned and operated by a British company.\n\nThat brings us back to a street overlooking the Clyde in Glasgow, where, in a glass-fronted office block, you will find the operational headquarters of a company called Seapeak. The chances are you haven't heard of Seapeak before, but this business owns and operates a fleet of LNG tankers all across the world.\n\nThat fleet includes the Yakov Gakkel and four other LNG icebreakers that ply this Siberian trade. That a British company might be facilitating this lucrative trade for Russia might come as a surprise, but there is nothing illegal about this: the sanctions regime on Russia just turns out to be significantly more porous than you might have thought.\n\nWe tried repeatedly to speak to Seapeak - to ask them about the Yakov Gakkel and whether they felt it was appropriate - given the UK has forsworn LNG imports - that a British company and British workers are helping administer this Russian trade. We sent emails with questions. However, they did not respond to our calls or our emails.\n\nWhen, after weeks of efforts to get a response, I visited their offices in Glasgow, I was met by a security guard who told me Seapeak would not see me without an appointment (which they were refusing to give me). Eventually I was told that if I would not leave they would call the police.\n\nImage: A security guard at Seapeak's offices in Glasgow said no one was available to speak to Sky News\n\nSeapeak is not the only British company helping keep Russian gas flowing. While British insurers are banned from protecting oil tankers carrying Russian crude, there's no equivalent sanction on Russian LNG ships, with the upshot that many of these tankers are insured by British companies operating out of the Square Mile.\n\nWe spent some time tracking another icebreaking tanker, the Vladimir Rusanov, as it approached Zeebrugge. It is insured by the UK P&I Club, which also insures a number of other LNG carriers.\n\nIn a statement, it said: \"The UK Club takes great care to observe all applicable sanctions regulations in relation to Russian energy cargoes, but the direct carriage of LNG from Yamal to Zeebrugge, and provision of insurance services for such carriage, is not presently sanctioned. If the EU and G7 nations were to change their policy\u2026 the Club would of course comply by adjusting or withdrawing its services, as necessary.\"\n\nImage: The Vladimir Rusanov off the coast of Zeebrugge\n\nThe transport of Russian gas into Europe - its dependence on British operators and insurers - is only one small example of the loopholes and omissions in the UK sanctions regime. But while government ministers have expressed concern about the effectiveness of the broader sanctions regime, there is still scant evidence they intend to tighten up this corner of it.\n\nBefore the election was called the Treasury Select Committee was in the middle of collecting evidence for its own inquiry into the regime, which was expected to focus on insurers of vessels taking Russian goods. However, the inquiry was wound up prematurely when the election was called in May.\n\nRead more on Sky News:\n\nEU sanctions target Russian gas for first time\n\nRussian oil still seeping into the UK\n\nBe the first to get Breaking News Install the Sky News app for free\n\nIn the meantime, ships like the Yakov Gakkel carry on taking billions of cubic metres of gas from the gas fields of Yamal in Siberia down to Europe, in exchange for billions of euros. And those and other hydrocarbon revenues are one of the main explanations for how Russia is able to produce more missiles and weapons than the Ukrainians.\n\nSo Europe carries on fuelling its industry and its power and heating grids with molecules of gas coming from Siberian gasfields, while assuring itself it's doing everything it can to fight Vladimir Putin.\n\nIt is, in short, a discomforting situation. But given the alternative is to induce another cost of living crisis, there is little appetite in Europe to change things.",
        "summary": "Because this is one of the world's most advanced liquefied natural gas (LNG) tankers, with an unusual trick up its sleeve.\nBut while volumes of Russian pipeline gas into Europe have dropped dramatically, the amount of Russian LNG coming into Europe has risen to record levels.\nThis Russian gas has helped Europe replenish its gas stores, it has helped keep the continent's heavy industry going throughout the Ukraine war.\nPerhaps this explains why the continent's politicians have, so far, stopped short of banning imports of Russian gas: they are aware that their economy would struggle to withstand another sharp spike in inflation - which would almost certainly eventuate if it stopped taking Russian gas altogether.\nHowever, those transshipments account for only a fraction - at most a quarter - of the Russian gas coming in on tankers to Europe.",

        "body": "Drivers are being warned fuel prices are on the rise again amid rising oil costs and suggestions motorists are still getting a raw deal.\n\nThe AA declared on Tuesday that a 10-week run of falling pump prices had come to an end.\n\nThe motoring group said while average costs were still locked at levels seen last week, a growing number of forecourts were imposing hikes to pump costs due to higher oil and wholesale charges.\n\nIts rival, the RAC, said in a separate study that prices for both petrol and diesel remained \"too expensive\", accusing retailers in England, Scotland and Wales of giving their customers a \"raw deal\" based on wholesale trends.\n\nElection latest:\n\nStarmer incredulous over latest Tory attack line\n\nPetrol should be an average 4.5p a litre lower across the three nations, its report stated, while diesel should be 8p less.\n\nIndependent retailers have long denied the RAC's claims of profiteering, claiming its criticism takes no account of the industry's increased costs for things such as wages and electricity.\n\nThere is currently a voluntary fuel price transparency scheme in place operated by the Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) after it found drivers were overcharged by supermarkets in 2022 to the tune of \u00a3900m.\n\nA statutory Pumpwatch scheme is expected to replace it later this year, forcing forecourts to divulge their costs.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe initiative, which is modelled on an existing price comparison service used in Northern Ireland and credited with bolstering competition, could also result in the regulator being given powers to fine rip-off fuel providers.\n\nThe final make-up will be determined by whoever forms the next government after Thursday's general election.\n\nPlease use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player 1:23 March: Fuel duty freeze extended for 12 months\n\nThe CMA's transparency scheme showed average petrol costs at 144.5p and diesel at 149.6p on Monday.\n\nAA fuel price spokesman Luke Bosdet said: \"The question is whether, after a significant fall in the UK's average petrol price in June, the price will repeat last year's sharp rise going further into the summer.\n\n\"It would be a blow for the impending summer getaway if the cost of road travel took off again.\n\n\"For now, filling up sooner rather later will take advantage of current lower prices. Statutory fuel price transparency coming into force later this year will therefore be a big boost for drivers facing this type of market movement in the future.\n\n\"At present, the scheme has revealed some upheaval in old patterns of fuel retailing, such as Asda offering supermarket pump prices at some non-supermarket forecourts where it has a retail presence and the independent chain Motor Fuel Group providing cheap fuel on former Morrison supermarket forecourts.\"\n\nSupermarkets had historically been the market leaders in fuel price costs, often offering discounts on top to lure shoppers to their stores.\n\nThis ended during the cost of living crisis as chains invested instead in dropping prices for household essentials.\n\nPlease use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player 6:30 Life in the cost of living crisis\n\nThe RAC report claimed that UK wholesale fuel costs did not justify the average prices still being charged outside Northern Ireland.\n\nIt said that there were vast differences between average costs at supermarket pumps and that Shell and BP-branded sites tended to charge the most.\n\nRAC head of policy Simon Williams said: \"We will continue to highlight this disparity, along with the massive differences between major retailers' high and low prices, to the new government and the Competition and Markets Authority with a view to them being addressed by the new Pumpwatch scheme when it is up and running.\"\n\nLSEG data on Tuesday showed Brent crude oil, the international benchmark, trading above $87 a barrel - levels last seen at the end of April.\n\nGlobal oil costs have been rising steadily since early June.\n\nRead more from Sky News\n\nHow British firms help to keep Russian gas flowing into Europe\n\nNew free streaming service launched in the UK\n\nFollow Sky News on WhatsApp Keep up with all the latest news from the UK and around the world by following Sky News Tap here\n\nBe the first to get Breaking News Install the Sky News app for free\n\nSome of the increases can be attributed to rolling production cuts by major oil-producing nations in the OPEC+ cartel, which includes Saudi Arabia and Russia.\n\nThe conflict in the Middle East, disruption to shipping in the Red Sea and forecasts of rising demand in China have also weighed.\n\nExpectations of a 5% lift in drivers using America's roads during the peak summer holiday season were helping drive the price higher on Tuesday, according to market analysts.\n\nHani Abuagla, senior market analyst at XTB MENA, added: \"Furthermore, Hurricane Beryl impacted sentiment, posing a threat to oil production if it shifts toward the Gulf of Mexico.\n\n\"These uncertainties led to further market volatility.\"",

        "body": "Just 18% of companies in the UK are led by women, and while data suggests female entrepreneurs are on the rise, men still receive more funding and are entrusted with higher average loans to get them started.\n\nIn an eight-part series for Sky News' Money blog, our reporter Jess Sharp speaks to women who are bossing it in their respective fields - hearing their stories, struggles and advice for those who want to follow in their footsteps.\n\nThis week, she has spoken to Kelly McCabe, the co-founder of the UK's first virtual cancer care clinic Perci Health...\n\nWhen Kelly and her co-founder Morgan Fitzsimons set up their business, they made an unusual decision - they sat down and planned when they'd both have children.\n\nIt's a topic many men will never feel the need to discuss with their business partners, but as two women, it was something they realistically needed to think about.\n\n\"We had a long conversation and made a decision that we would have children at different times so that one person would stay in the business to allow the other to take the time out they needed,\" Kelly said.\n\n\"Of course, you can't plan this thing perfectly, but we were fortunate enough that it kind of happened that way.\"\n\nMorgan was the first to have her baby and returned to work after a couple of months off, and Kelly gave birth six months later.\n\nA month after having her now nearly two-year-old son, Kelly returned to work and Perci Health has continued to grow ever since.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n'Whether it was NHS or private care - I saw the same problem'\n\nDespite Perci Health being a virtual care clinic, Kelly's career background had nothing to do with app development - she started out in the NHS.\n\nOne of the roles she had was helping people with cancer eat and drink while receiving treatment.\n\nWorking mostly with people with head and neck cancer, she supported them with tube feeding and their rehabilitation back to solid foods.\n\nAfter working in a similar area in private healthcare, she realised all cancer patients were experiencing the same problem.\n\nMoney blog - get the latest finance and consumer news\n\nImage: Kelly and Morgan from Perci Health\n\n\"There was a universal experience at the end of treatment where you would have your final review with your cancer nurse or oncologist, and they would say 'see you again in six months or 12 months time',\" Kelly said.\n\n\"Patients would come back into our follow-up clinics with all sorts of problems they had been living with for six months or 12 months and no one was really managing them.\n\n\"They had to just be grinning and bearing it, thinking it was just par for the course after having cancer.\"\n\nShe decided to come up with an idea that would connect people living with cancer with professionals who could provide long-term support and optimise their wellbeing.\n\nMale investors in a male-bias sector\n\nWith a plan in mind, she reached out to her friend Morgan, who had a background in digital marketing, and the pair got started working weekends and evenings to build their company.\n\nWhen COVID hit, they made the decision to \"just go for it\", quit their jobs and put all their focus on the business.\n\nTheir first round of funding came from family and friends, raising \u00a3500,000, which gave them enough to pay themselves a reduced salary and hire a small team.\n\nBut more funding was needed, and they started reaching out to investors.\n\nWith Kelly's clinical experience, the issue she was trying to solve in the health care sector seemed \"obvious\", but the first hurdle she faced was convincing others that it was \"important enough to solve\".\n\n\"The challenges seemed very obvious to us, but they might not necessarily be obvious to investors, and I think that is particularly true if you're solving a problem that affects women,\" she said.\n\n\"I'm really sad to say that it's kind of the old-fashioned things you think of, like a lot of them sell on the golf course or over lunch or going shooting, and we don't get invited to golf or to shoot.\n\n\"You don't get many female-owned technology businesses, so that was a barrier.\"\n\nRead more from this series:\n\nHow accident in cafe and \u00a3400 turned into a genius business idea that's about to go global\n\n'How I went from mum with no qualifications to owner of big law firm'\n\nMeet the woman behind the UK's first net zero whisky distillery\n\nPregnant, pitching and spotting red flags\n\nWhile meeting potential investors, Kelly was heavily pregnant and was \"nervous\" to explain her situation out of fear it would put them off investing.\n\n\"When I had my first conversation with our now lead investor, I was 38 weeks pregnant, so we just did all the conversations on Zoom,\" she said.\n\n\"She called and said 'we'd like to invite you in to meet the team and do a formal pitch. Can you do it next week?' and obviously I had to tell her I was heavily pregnant.\n\n\"She could tell I was nervous about telling her... but she said she was sorry that I had to explain myself, and we could just delay the pitch.\n\n\"We pushed it back about six weeks, but not all investors are that understanding, which is why I was so nervous to explain it.\"\n\nUnfortunately, Kelly said she was \"definitely asked\" in the early fundraising rounds if she was planning to have children.\n\n\"The feedback from male investments clubs was that women don't know how they feel and may not return to work after having a baby or their motivation to run a business may change,\" she said.\n\n\"Early on, we were just looking for investment and we would have taken any partner, but now these are the red flags that we look for.\n\n\"There is some definite progress to be made.\"\n\nIn total, Kelly has raised \u00a35m and still owns 40% of Perci Health.\n\nImage: Kelly, Chantal Cox, who led a funding round for Perci Health, and Morgan\n\nAll the challenges\n\nAway from the challenge of fundraising, Kelly also had to deal with life as a new mum, which brought its own challenges as a business owner.\n\nShe explained how having children early in the company's life meant it was still \"relatively fragile\" and there wasn't the chance to take maternity leave knowing her job would be safe when she returned.\n\n\"There was a bit of a juggle with that and needing to go back to work very quickly after the baby was born, and then the other challenge is childcare,\" she said.\n\n\"You don't want to be taking too much money out of your business and you're rewarded with equity rather than a salary - but of course, equity doesn't pay for childcare.\"\n\nKelly also found there was an \"underestimation\" of her abilities from male investors, and it was something she noticed in the choice of language used to describe her.\n\n\"I believe women business owners are underestimated and that is evidenced by the fact that less investment goes to us, but there's research that shows women-owned companies are more profitable,\" she said.\n\n\"The language they use is interesting. For example, I'm often described as a conservative CEO within the portfolio because I'm focused on financial preservation... but would my male counterpart be seen as such or would he be seen as having optimal control?\"\n\nKelly's advice\n\nKelly's top tip is to find a business partner, possibly even two, that can help your business grow.\n\n\"Building a business alone would be significantly harder,\" she said.\n\n\"Co-founders just help ease the burden when one of you needs to take time out, so find yourself a good business partner.\"\n\nShe also recommended taking \"a lot of time\" to build a \"strong network\", which she said would help \"protect you as your business grows\".\n\n\"There are a lot of female entrepreneurs or female business networks that are great. Morgan and I are members of lots of them,\" she added.\n\n\"It's amazing how the amount of advice and support that we have been given for free from other women just wanting to help.\"\n\nShe said it was important to have a \"really thick skin and to be very persistent\".\n\n\"Even in the very best businesses, you get those 100 no's before you get that one yes,\" she added.",

        "body": "Hulme Grammar School in Oldham doesn't feel like a bastion of privilege, but the children whose parents pay around \u00a315,000 a year for them to attend are nevertheless among an elite minority.\n\nA selective fee-paying school, Hulme is one of around 2,500 independent schools that educate 7% of the school population, a minority that is the target of one of Labour's few unapologetically tax-raising policies.\n\nIf elected, Labour says it will end the VAT exemption on fees, making them subject to 20% tax, raising an estimated \u00a31.6bn the party says will be used to hire 6,500 teachers in the state sector that educates 93% of children.\n\nPrivate school parents fear the increase will be passed on directly, pricing some children out, while industry bodies claim some schools will close.\n\nOldham is one of the poorest towns in England and Hulme is one of the country's more affordable independent schools, its fees around the national average and well short of the \u00a350,000 charged by Eton and the prime minister's alma mater Winchester College.\n\nHeadteacher Tony Oulton, state educated and with experience working on both sides of Britain's educational divide, says Labour's policy misrepresents the majority of private schools and punishes parents.\n\n\"The sector is not Eton or Harrow or Winchester, the big posh boarding schools largely based in the south of England.\n\n\"The majority is made up of schools like mine where parents are making real sacrifices to pay the school fees because that's how they are choosing to prioritise their spending.\"\n\n'They are prioritising education the way some prioritise holidays'\n\nAdvertisement\n\nEven without the Labour policy, fees at Hulme will rise 5.5% next year, a figure Mr Oulton says reflects the wider costs pressures, primarily wages for teachers. He says he cannot absorb the VAT rise without sacrificing the 24-child class size limit he believes parents are paying for.\n\n\"I lament the political debate, the loss of nuance and insight into the impact on children.\n\n\"The idea they are buying privilege and separation would not resonate with parents here. They don't recognise the rhetoric that sits around this, that they are part of some privileged elite. They are prioritising education the way some prioritise holidays.\"\n\nPlease use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player 2:48 Private schools 'will adapt' to VAT tax\n\nPrivately educated children do nevertheless enjoy advantages. At \u00a315,000 the average fee is double the \u00a37,500-per-head funding in the state sector, and selection allows independent schools to choose who they want to educate.\n\nAnalysis by the Institute for Fiscal Studies meanwhile shows that private school attendance is concentrated among the wealthiest households, with three quarters of pupils drawn from the 30% of highest earners, and most from the top 10%.\n\nThis perhaps explains why Labour has felt able to concentrate one of its few openly tax-raising policies on the sector.\n\nIt argues that the needs of the state system, relied on by 93% of parents, make it popular while unspoken is the possibility that complaints of those who can afford fees in the first place will elicit little sympathy.\n\nThey are relaxed too about warnings that increasing fees will lead to an exodus of pupils that will put state schools under pressure.\n\nPrivate school rolls have remained constant despite average fees increasing almost 50% in the last decade, and state secondary registers are forecast to fall 7% in the next decade as a population bulge passes through the system.\n\nFollow Sky News on WhatsApp Keep up with all the latest news from the UK and around the world by following Sky News Tap here\n\nState education is facing undeniable challenges, including recruitment and retention, with one in four teachers leaving after three years in classrooms.\n\nThe growth in demand for special educational needs provision is also putting schools and local authorities under pressure. Some 576,000 children had an active education and health plan in January, almost as many as the total private school roll of around 615,000.\n\nHeadlands School in Bridlington faces typical challenges, all while working to clear a \u00a31m deficit from its budget.\n\nAssistant head teacher Adam Woolley said the issues for state education go beyond the school gate.\n\n\"It is not just about school funding but funding all the services around young people. A million people are in child poverty so there is only so much schools can do if children come in hungry, cold and without that stable foundation,\" he says.\n\n\"I take the argument from private schools and parents that it is a squeeze on people being aspirational for their children, but all parents are aspirational. State schools can and absolutely should be a place where you can send your child and aspire to great things, but that needs funding.\"",

        "title": "How to split housework fairly - and the things you shouldn't say",
        "body": "Splitting up household jobs, whether that be cleaning, washing or life admin, is an issue that affects a lot of couples.\n\nStarling Bank found women do a total of 36 hours of household tasks and admin per week - equivalent to a full-time job.\n\nThis is nine hours more than men - and yet men believe they do the majority in their household. The average man estimates they do 52% of work overall.\n\nRead all the latest Money news here\n\nIt's the discrepancy between perception and reality (and, of course, this can work both ways) that leads to arguments.\n\nCouples who don't divide the housework equally have roughly five arguments about housework each month - rising to eight for couples who rely on just one person for the work.\n\nWe spoke to relationship expert Hayley Quinn about the best ways to split household work - and how to deal with arguments should they arise with your partner.\n\nShe explained that it's necessary to be \"transparent\" when deciding how to split the workload - but also to be flexible in order to find a solution that suits all involved.\n\nWhile a 50/50 split might be your idea of perfection, Ms Quinn said it was \"almost inevitable that one partner may take on slightly more of the load\" at different periods of time.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\"Striving for perfect 50/50 fairness at all times is a really nice idea, but it just may not be that practical for modern life,\" she said.\n\nShe said some jobs may be more visible than others, like cleaning, sorting out the washing and taking the bins out.\n\nOther jobs can take up just as much time and resource but will fly under the radar. She gave examples of sorting out travel insurance or changing over internet provider.\n\nImage: Hayley Quinn\n\nHow should you approach a conversation with your partner about splitting the work?\n\nTo start off, Ms Quinn said you should enter the conversation with a positive mindset - think how you are both contributing to the relationship in different ways.\n\n\"When you're having these conversations, it's not that many people are sitting around feeling like they're not contributing,\" she said.\n\n\"In fact, I think if there's a discrepancy in how people contribute, it's just due to a lack of awareness as to what the other partner does, and some chores are just more obviously visible than others.\"\n\nTry to avoid starting the chat with the perspective that you are working a lot harder than your partner and they're not pulling their weight.\n\n\"That way, you start from a place of we're all on the same team,\" she said.\n\n\"When you're doing that as well, it's really important not to make statements which assume what the other partner is thinking, feeling, or contributing.\"\n\nRead more:\n\nYour rights when a new car keeps breaking down\n\nThe mortgage chokehold facing old-age Britons\n\nThe most common holiday booking scams\n\nMs Quinn added: \"So, for instance, saying something like 'I'm always the one that's picking the kids up from school and you never do anything', becomes easily very accusational, and this is when arguments start.\n\n\"Instead, most partners will be much more receptive if you simply ask for more help and assistance.\"\n\nWhen asking for help, Ms Quinn said it's important to ask in a way that's verbal and clear - don't assume your partner is going to intuitively know what share of household chores to take on if you just complain.\n\n\"In a nice way, explicitly ask for what you want. It could be something like saying, 'Look, I know that we're both working a long week, but I feel like there's so much to do. It would be really helpful if... I'd really appreciate it if you take over lunch,'\" she explained.\n\n\"Again, start from a place of appreciation. Acknowledge what your partner contributes already, and be explicitly clear as to what you would like them to do. Phrase it as a request for their help.\"\n\nShe also said some people can feel protective of how jobs are completed, and learning to relinquish that control can be helpful.\n\n\"If you want it to feel more equitable, you have to let your partner do things in their own way,\" she said.\n\nImage: Pic: iStock\n\nWhat happens if that doesn't work?\n\nIf you find the conversations aren't helping, you can always try organising a rota, Ms Quinn said.\n\nShe recommended using Starling Bank's Share the Load tool to work out your chore split.\n\nHowever, she said if you feel there are constant conversations and nothing is changing then the issue is becoming more about communication than sharing the workload.\n\n\"It's actually about someone not hearing what you're trying to communicate to them, so it's more of a relationship-wide issue,\" she said.\n\nShe advised sitting down and trying to have another transparent verbal conversation, making it clear that you have spoken about this before and how it's making you feel in a factual way, without placing blame.\n\nUsing phrases like \"I've noticed\" or \"I've observed\" can help, she said.\n\nIf after all that, the situation still isn't getting better, she said it's time to consider confiding in friends or family for support, or seeing a relationship counsellor.",

        "title": "McEwen Mining Stock: Shares Oversold, Now More Attractive With Better Prospects (NYSE:MUX)",
        "body": "Ravitaliy\n\nA \u201cBuy\u201d Rating for McEwen Mining\n\nThis analysis suggests a \u201cBuy\u201d recommendation for shares of McEwen Mining (NYSE:MUX) (TSX:MUX:CA) as, thanks to improved precious metals assets performance in Nevada and good prospects for the mineral projects in Ontario and Argentina, this stock is considered to be well-anchored in the expected uptrend in the gold and silver price cycle amid friendly conditions for the metals with robust demand for hedging strategies and bets on the rate cut by the Federal Reserve (or \u201cFed\u201d).\n\nPresident Javier Milei's legislative package, recently approved by Parliament, has created a much more proactive framework for corporate activities in Argentina. The package aims to reduce bureaucracy in the Argentine economy and give significantly more space to private initiatives, especially the mining industry, one of the pillars of the country's economy.\n\nRegarding \u201cThe Outlook for Gold and Silver,\u201d an entire section is devoted to this topic later in this analysis.\n\nFrom the Previous Buy Rating: What Happened\n\nThis article maintains the same rating of \u201cBuy\u201d as the previous article when McEwen shares were expected to reach significantly higher prices. Although not better positioned than its direct competitors in terms of production and costs, the strong bullish sentiment towards gold and silver was seen as an effective upward driver for share prices of McEwen.\n\nSince the last buy recommendation on March 11, 2024, the market price of McEwen shares has increased by 11.01%, while the US stock market benchmarked by the S&P 500 stock index has increased by 7.10%.\n\nWhile prior to the subsequent rally the stock did not offer a temporary \u201chealthy\u201d pullback for a bigger return given how tied to the metal's upside its share price was, investors were still very pleased with the stock flying to record highs between late April and late May 2024 despite starting from an overbought level the recent analysis showed with prices above MA Ribbon and RSI at 70.\n\nShares in McEwen were helped sharply to the top by the \u201cmetal's third straight monthly gain\u201d in late April, overshadowed after a few weeks by a \u201cnew record high\u201d among investors looking for gold (and silver) as a portfolio hedge and rising interest rate cut hopes following encouraging US inflation numbers.\n\nIn the wake of the sharp tailwind from precious metals prices, Q1 2024 operating and financial results may have added some extra positivity to McEwen Mining stock's momentum due to the following:\n\n100% interest in the gold/silver open pit \u201cGold Bar Mine\u201d in Nevada (46 km northwest of Eureka) and 49% interest in the gold/silver underground San Jose mine (48 km east of Perito Moreo, Argentina) performed well.\n\nMcEwen Mining Inc. indirectly owns San Jos\u00e9 through Minera Santa Cruz S.A., a joint venture that directly owns 100% of San Jos\u00e9, and the mine's operator is the majority shareholder of the joint venture, Hochschild Mining plc (OTCQX:HCHDF), which owns the remaining 51% of the joint venture.\n\nIn addition, President Milei's liberal political leadership in Argentina makes it easier to be optimistic about the prospects for San Jose and the success of the 47.7% indirect interest in the Los Azules project for future copper/gold/silver production 164 km northwest of San Juan, Argentina.\n\nMcEwen Copper Inc. owns a 100% direct interest in the Los Azules copper project and currently has approximately 30.94 million shares outstanding. Excluding the impact of the raising of US$70 million through a private placement of up to ~2.33 million shares for subsidiary McEwen Copper to advance the Los Azules Copper Project, with respect to beneficial ownership of Los Azules, McEwen Mining owns 47.7% of McEwen Copper, Stellantis N.V. (STLA) 19.4%, Nuton 14.5%, Rob McEwen (Chairman and majority owner of McEwen Mining) 12.9%, Victor Smogon Group 3.2% and other shareholders 2.3%.\n\nDownward Long-Term Trend Disrupted by Bullish Precious Metal\n\nBy outperforming its direct rivals on the stock market, McEwen stock has now reversed a trend that had underperformed the VanEck Junior Gold Miners ETF (GDXJ) or its industry\u2019s benchmark index over the long term, reinforcing the thesis of previous analysis that this stock is suitable for capitalize on strong short-term movements in the gold price.\n\nDespite the positive correlation with the Gold Spot Price or XAUUSD:CUR and Silver Spot Price or XAGUSD:CUR, McEwen Mining shares on the NYSE under the symbol MUX and on the Toronto Stock Exchange under the symbol MUX:CA over the past 5 years have shown a significant decrease in value while GDXJ increased 21.15%. The positive correlation, which means that McEwen stocks and gold or silver tend to move in the same direction on average, is graphically represented by dark yellow and light blue area curves that have consistently traded above zero for the past 5 years. The positive correlation means that when stocks are bullish, gold or silver is most likely also bullish, and when stocks are bearish, the metal is most likely also bearish, regardless of returns, which can even be vastly different between the assets.\n\nSource: Seeking Alpha\n\nBut now the last 5-year trend has been shocked:\n\nWhile driven by the sustained rise in the gold price (up 13.25% YTD) or silver price (up 24.45% YTD) coupled with the good results and rosy growth prospects outlined in the Q1-2024 report, McEwen stocks continued to perform significantly better than GDXJ industry as anticipated in the last analysis on March 11, 2024. Although the Ontario mine underperformed, higher consolidated production combined with rising metal prices resulted in a 36.4% year-over-year increase in gross profit to $6 million and a 117% increase in adjusted EBITDA to $6.3 million. Also, a lower consolidated net loss of $20.4 million in the first quarter, primarily due to the investment in McEwen Copper, compared to a net loss of $43.1 million in the first quarter of 2023. The market was pleased with the Q1-2024 profit results from McEwen Mining, and the earnings are acting as a driving force behind share prices in the markets.\n\nSource: Seeking Alpha\n\nMcEwen Mining in Q1-2024 and the Boost to its Growth Plans\n\nAs for the assets already producing the metals: in addition to 100% in the \u201cGold Bar Mine\u201d in Nevada and 49% in the underground \u201cSan Jose mine\u201d in Argentina, with geolocation better detailed earlier, McEwen Mining has 100% ownership of the gold and silver underground Fox Complex located 65 km east of Timmins, Ontario, Canada.\n\nFor the first three months of 2024, these mines produced 32,725 gold equivalent ounces (or \u201cGEOs\u201d) on a consolidated basis, representing 8% year-over-year growth, but on a quarterly basis, it was below the full-year 2024 midpoint guidance range of 130,000 to 145,000 GEOs.\n\nSource: McEwen Mining Operating and Financial Reports\n\nContinuing the Q1-2024 trend, Gold Bar Mine is on track to surpass last year when it produced 43,700 GEOs at an AISC of $1,891/oz and also its own guidance of 40,000 to 43,000 GEOs at $1,650 -1,750 AISC/GEO for the whole year of 2024. Gold Bar produced 11,716 GEOs, a more than 80% increase over the previous year quarter. However, production was affected by severe flooding the year before and AISC/oz of $1,201 in Q1-2024 could rise in the second half of 2024 as the company announced operations to move to mining areas with higher strip conditions.\n\nThe Fox Complex was impacted by lower-than-expected mining and stockpile grades, resulting in production of 7,486 GEOs in Q1-2024, below plan and more than 40% lower than the prior year quarter. AISC per GEO of $1,928 was also impacted, increasing 47% year-on-year.\n\nThe start of 2024 has not been particularly promising for McEwen Mining's operations in Ontario, but the issues that led to a deterioration in performance in the first quarter of 2024 are turning positive again. The break of a positive trend makes the company very optimistic about Fox Complex's prospects despite a very weak first quarter of 2024. The full year 2024 production and cost guidance of 40,000 to 42,000 GEOs at $1,450-1,550 AISC/oz is confirmed as the company is confident it can meet the target, which at this point implies growth from the first quarter of 2024 by calculating the quarterly figures on an annual basis. Thus, the company has priced a 2-tranche public financing as it intends to collect the estimated net proceedings of $20.9 million and set aside for drilling and underground infrastructure development will unlock the production growth that should be standard equipment at the Fox Complex.\n\nIn San Jos\u00e9, production of 12,950 GEOs increased 15% year-over-year in the first quarter of 2024 due to an improvement in the average grade of the mining material processed, causing AISC/GEO to decline 13% year-over-year to $1,947. In line with higher, continued improvement in metal grades as production approaches the midpoint of the full-year 2024 guidance range of 50,000 to 60,000 GEOs, AISC/GEO will probably be lower and in the $1,500 to $1,700 range.\n\nThe new environmental outlook for Argentine mining and exploration under President Milei's administration and his plans to ease exchange controls and enact regulatory reforms, should benefit the Los Azules and San Jos\u00e9 joint venture mine going forward.\n\nThe Los Azules project is a porphyry copper deposit that remains largely undeveloped. Over the past three years, McEwen Copper has reported investing over $230 million in exploration. Preliminary results from 227,000 feet (69,200 meters) of drilling completed so far during the 2023-2024 drilling campaign provide results consistent with the June 2023 Preliminary Economic Assessment (or June 2023 PEA), while metallurgical testing supports an average recovery of 76% using conventional technology, opening up the possibility of a project that could be even more valuable. Based on copper indicated resources of 10.9 billion pounds grading 0.40% Cu and additional copper inferred resources of 26.7 billion pounds grading 0.31% Cu as of PEA June 2023, the Los Azules project has a $2.7 billion after tax NPV8% but the metallurgical tests could raise it further by approx. US$262 million.\n\nThe resources are indicated and require further studies to upgrade to a higher mineral reserve category. Only this resource category allows a reliable assessment of the economic viability of the project. The above-mentioned $70 million non-brokered private placement financing from McEwen Mining will be used to accelerate the completion of a feasibility study for the Los Azules Copper Project. This should be available in early 2025 and since interest rates will have fallen by then, it should be much easier for the Los Azules copper project to raise the necessary funds, giving the entire project a boost.\n\nSan Jose aims to continue producing metals beyond 2028: Underground exploration near the San Jose mine now offers great potential to expand a mineralized area from the current 80 meters to a target of over 700 meters. Exploration activities indicate that there is potential for further exploitation of this deposit, not only downslope, but also in shallower areas where high mineral concentrations are expected.\n\nThe Outlook for Gold and Silver Prices\n\nIn times of heightened risk perception for economic growth and increasing global uncertainty, gold and, to a lesser extent, silver investments are used to hedge portfolios against potential negative value impacts. The fact that the Federal Reserve is keeping interest rates high between 5.25 and 5.50 percent on federal funds signals distrust in lending to the economy, as consumers and producers are not seen to provide sufficient solvency guarantees if they are now given hope of recovery. But investors have started to focus more on precious metals than US Treasuries as the latter's fixed-income asset class, with the prospect of lower returns, tends to cool in attractiveness, leaving more room for zero-income paying gold and silver. Because after 11 rate hikes from March 2022 to July 2023 to combat galloping inflation and no rate cut since then, market participants expect the Fed to reverse rates as inflation fell sharply from 9.1% in June 2022 to the current 3.3%. So, when hopes for the start of Fed rate cuts grow stronger, a rise in per-ounce prices usually follows.\n\nThe uncertainty scenario is also currently driving the demand for gold and silver in portfolio hedges as investors fear the impact on their assets of possible disruptions in the economy due to the geopolitical tensions with conflicts in Ukraine and issues in the Middle East at the center of global attention. While the jumps caused by expectations of an eventual rate cut heating up have short-term favorable effects on gold and silver prices, robust demand as a hedge against risk and uncertainty is more geared to strengthen the uptrend in the long term, creating a solid support structure below the prices. A little later they were identified with China's and other overseas bankers, but central bank buying is an activity that has been going on since early 2024, providing much support for the uptrend in the long run. Rather than inflation falling dramatically as described earlier, the potential recession from the Fed's hawkish rate policy led China to finance gold purchases through the sale of US dollar reserves to the extent that US investors also picked up the signal to hedge through the yellow metal against threats to the value of their economy. The previously negative sentiment in the West towards the yellow metal began to improve when Robert Crayfourd and Keith Watson, co-managers of the CQS Natural Resources Growth & Income Fund, signaled at the end of May that the significant increase in the use of the ETF as an indicator of investments in physical metals would give prices another boost.\n\nAt the end of May 2024, the analysts' team at UBS Group AG (UBS) Wealth Management welcomed the central bankers' purchases as \u201cstrategies that generate returns in gold\u201d - as a countermeasure against the risk of an economic slowdown burdened by inflation and expensive consumer and investment loans, as well as \u201chealthy\u201d hedging demand against the geopolitical risk factor. Driven by a vision of good momentum for such gold demand, the UBS team of analysts led by Solita Marcelli had raised their year-end gold price forecast to $2,600/oz, according to Marketwatch.\n\nRecently, other major US banks have been busy predicting the gold price in the upcoming period, with Citigroup Inc. (C), targeting $3,000/oz in the next 6 to 18 months, while a more limited but still generous rise to $2,700/oz by the end of the year The Goldman Sachs Group, Inc. (GS) has issued at the end of last month.\n\nCurrently, the Gold Spot Price (XAUUSD:CUR) is trading at $2,330.32/oz.\n\nAs for the Silver Spot Price (XAGUSD:CUR), gold's less shiny cousin, which is trading at $29.36/oz as of this writing, Michale DiRienzo, president and CEO of The Silver Institute, which regularly publishes statistics on the demand, supply and prices of the gray metal, last month pointed out that silver prices are poised to follow gold in its ample room to move forward.\n\nIn addition to hedging strategies, silver also has \u201csome very practical properties\u201d that are far less present in gold. These will help ensure that the grey metal does not lose touch if the gold price continues to rise. Silver is also used in industrial processes, such as in the manufacture of solar cells. Plus, an ounce of silver is relatively cheaper than gold, which acts as a buying incentive. Based on current market prices, it takes about 79 ounces of silver to buy one ounce of gold, compared to the \u201c20-year average of about 68.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe second-biggest market deficit in more than 20 years,\u201d expected this year by The Silver Institute, as a bright future for silver in the \u201cgreen energy transition\u201d envisioned by President Michale DiRienzo will exacerbate the problem of lower ore grades globally yielding insufficient supply of ounces will provide a robust upward pressure on the price of the gray metal.\n\nAnalyst Michael Widmer of fellow US banking major Bank of America Corporation (BAC) said last month that his view now remains bullish for the second half of 2024 and into 2025, expecting silver to average $35/oz in 2026.\n\nThe Share Price: The Stock Is a Buy, but a Lower Price Is Possible Under Current Conditions\n\nThe growth prospects for the metals are positive, the Nevada deposit is performing well, the Ontario deposit is benefiting from improving grades and the Argentina deposit is also on track to deliver more ounces at lower costs, this analysis suggests buying McEwen shares.\n\nShares were trading at $8.97 apiece for a market cap of $ 457.23 million under the MUX symbol on the NYSE market. Shares were trading around the middle point of the 52 Week Range of $5.92 to $12.50, and almost completely underneath any line of the MA Ribbon. So, these indicators suggest that the share price is currently low compared to recent trends, while the outlook remains very promising also due to the very favorable mining policies that can now reasonably be expected given the new economic climate under President Milei in Argentina.\n\nSource: Seeking Alpha\n\nThe 14-day Relative Strength Indicator of 27.80 suggests that the shares are now back at oversold levels as the last month has not been particularly exciting for the price of the precious metal as we have been spoiled by very significant gains in the previous months. This is most likely due to comments from Federal Reserve policymakers who recently showed reluctance to cut interest rates in September and are now predicting not even two but only one rate cut before the end of the year \u2013 and perhaps not even this year. If we add that there are even voices that do not rule out a further interest rate hike, then these views have put pressure on the price of precious metals. Not only do these - unlike US Treasuries - offer no income, but they also suffer from the fact that the strengthening of the US dollar due to Fed chiefs repeated \u201chigher for longer\u201d prophecies has made buying gold significantly less favorable for investors in non-US dollar currencies economies. A slowdown in investment demand for gold (but also silver, which is said to be \u201cpoor man's gold\u201d) has had depressing effects on McEwen shares through moderating precious metal prices.\n\nEssentially, it's down to the robust labor market, and last week there was another sign of that: the U.S. jobless claims of 233,000 in the period ending June 22 fell for the second week in a row. This forces the Fed to hold back from convincing itself that it is time to cut interest rates. The still very tight conditions in the labor market are blamed for the basis of sticky inflation, which is very reluctant to return to the medium-term target of interest rate of 2%. And then it could be that after this summer vacation, when people tend to spend more, households could complicate the plan of the Fed, which is trying to look as clearly as possible at the inflation issue before it rewinds the monetary policy coil. And so precious metals may still face headwinds, and the impact will still have ramifications for McEwen stock on the NYSE market.\n\nThe rating is Buy, but perhaps investors will wait and see how the sentiment around the Fed\u2019s first rate cut, now still expected in September, will be when we get there.\n\nThe same reasoning applies to shares of McEwen Mining on the Toronto Stock Exchange under the symbol MUX:CA: At the time of writing, these shares were trading at CA$12.41 a share, with a market capitalization of CA$628.20 million.\n\nSource: Seeking Alpha\n\nShares are trading nearly below almost each line of the MA Ribbon and near the midpoint of the 52-week range of CA$8.05 to CA$17.08 per share. The 14-day RSI of 28.35 suggests oversold levels but does not rule out lower valuations as further headwinds could lie ahead.\n\nLow Liquid Stock in Toronto Stock Exchange\n\nInvestors are certainly aware of the disadvantages usually associated with the low daily trading volumes, as McEwen Mining shares on the Toronto Stock Exchange seem to be characterized: over the past 3 months, an average of 42,207 shares have been traded on the TSX (scroll down to the Trading Data section on this Seeking Alpha page).\n\nOf the total 50.97 million shares outstanding, 41.32 million shares are in the free float, freely tradable on the open market of the Canadian exchange, and institutions own 31.08% of the free float.\n\nInvestors must therefore remember that it can be very difficult to bring an oversized position up to the desired volume if circumstances suddenly demand it.\n\nConclusion\n\nThis analysis suggests a \u201cBuy\u201d recommendation for McEwen shares as their price should be driven by positive forces, which essentially consist of continued optimistic precious metal prices and improved business prospects.\n\nSilver and gold will benefit as investors turn to hedge properties amid risky economic scenarios and an uncertain global outlook. The company's production and costs have performed well in Nevada, and now they should also be accompanied by improvements in Ontario and Argentina, where McEwen Mining's growth projects welcome President Javier Milei's new political economy to deregulate and give more space to private initiatives also to foreign investors.\n\nSince inflation, until it convinces in its downward adjustment, may still influence Fed policymakers holding back from implementing the first rate cut, a sustained \u201chigher-for-longer\u201d stance on interest rates could result in US Treasuries paying income in the form of a predetermined interest rate being preferred to zero-income yielding gold and silver. Catching shares of McEwen on this short-term dip in bullish sentiment in the gold and silver spot markets could make buying this stock a bigger opportunity than today given the bright outlook.",
        "summary": "From the Previous Buy Rating: What HappenedThis article maintains the same rating of \u201cBuy\u201d as the previous article when McEwen shares were expected to reach significantly higher prices.\nThe market was pleased with the Q1-2024 profit results from McEwen Mining, and the earnings are acting as a driving force behind share prices in the markets.\nThe above-mentioned $70 million non-brokered private placement financing from McEwen Mining will be used to accelerate the completion of a feasibility study for the Los Azules Copper Project.\nThese will help ensure that the grey metal does not lose touch if the gold price continues to rise.\nAnd so precious metals may still face headwinds, and the impact will still have ramifications for McEwen stock on the NYSE market.",

However gross margins have declined sharply and hampered overall profitability. Despite management's guidance calling for a deceleration in revenue growth for the remaining quarters, future growth should remain strong due to the company's solid backlog and recent contract wins. I believe shares are fairly valued at 35 times EV to adjusted EBITDA. Although the growth prospects are attractive, the risks from dilution and weak margins lead me to assign a neutral rating.\n\nQ1 earnings snapshot\n\nQ1 earnings presentation\n\nThe company reported a 52% increase in Q1 revenue versus the prior year period, as shown above. This was driven by the 19% growth in its contracted backlog that the company achieved during 2023, which included large long-lead purchases that were fulfilled during Q1. Despite the strong revenue growth, adjusted EBITDA was only in-line with Q1 2023. The main reason behind this was the decline in gross margins to 16.8% versus 24.6% in Q1 2023. Management pointed out that gross profit was impacted by Estimate at Completion (EAC) adjustments which amounted to $3.9 million. Backing out this impact, gross margins would have ended up at 21.2%. When questioned during the Q1 earnings call about the future impact of EACs on gross margins, the company's CFO stated:\n\nAs far as the gross margins are concerned. On the EACs, we are driving towards low volatility, right? We don't want to see this level of EAC on an absolute basis, but it's really looked at on an LTM basis, not on a quarterly basis. You could see a movement up, but we are really trying to drive towards what great program management looks like, which is zero EACs.\n\nThough he doesn't seem to expect the volatility in EACs to completely go away, he does emphasize that its impact will be reduced when viewing gross margins over a period of four quarters. Nonetheless looking ahead, management's guidance points to 23% growth expected in 2024 versus 2023. Following 52% growth in Q1, the guidance implies a significant deceleration in revenue growth for the remaining quarters.\n\nSolid backlog and significant recent contract wins\n\nThe company carried solid momentum into this year following the signing of a $142 million order for its Roll Out Solar Arrays (ROSA) at the end of last year. This year the company was chosen to deploy the ROSA product for Thales Alenia Space\u2019s satellites. Furthermore, the European Space Agency awarded the company a contract for building a robotic arm prototype for the agency\u2019s Argonaut Lunar Lander. Last month the company was awarded a contract from the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) for a project that involved Redwire's SabreSat VLEO platform.\n\nQ1 earnings presentation\n\nThe company's contracted backlog was 10.9% higher in Q1 than in the prior year period even before the recent contract wins mentioned above. As shown in the image above, the contracts for which the company has submitted bids was 177% higher than at the same time last year. The reasons behind this sharp increase was highlighted by its CEO when he said:\n\nIn terms of the bidding, you can see that bidding is accelerating and that's a function of two dynamics. One is more aggressively going to market, but two, as part of the growth principles is bidding those higher-level production contracts for higher quantities as well as some larger contracts for -- we're the full systems integrator, right? So that's really the takeaway from, I think the key takeaway from the increase in the number of bids.\n\nManagement also highlighted the recent success of its proprietary in-space pharmaceutical manufacturing platform PIL-BOX. After seeing promising results from its recent mission, management expects 16 additional PIL-BOX missions this year. Though revenue contribution from this business segment is expected to be insignificant for the next few years, Redwire's CEO highlighted the optionality that this presented saying:\n\nRecent venture funding for related industry players has revealed a significant valuation premium for pharmaceutical microgravity development, validating that the venture optionality associated with this subset of Redwire's business has real value.\n\nRisks to consider\n\nDilutive impact from convertible preferred stock\n\nQ1 10-Q report\n\nIn November 2022, the company raised $80 million through the issuance of convertible preferred stock. The annual dividend yield on these shares amounted to 13% if paid in cash, and 15% if paid using the company's shares. According to the company's latest Form 10-Q, the total number of convertible preferred shares outstanding was 93.89 million, with a conversion price of $3.05 per share. Upon conversion, the number of ordinary outstanding shares in the company is expected to increase by approximately 31 million. Thereby shares outstanding would increase from 65.6 million to 96.6 million, implying a potential dilution of around 47%.\n\nIn addition to the potential dilution that shareholders face, there is a possibility that the holders of the convertible preferred shares may chose to sell their shares once they are converted, as the ordinary shares do not pay a dividend. This could create an overhang on the company's stock price.\n\nWeak profitability\n\nAdjusted EBITDA was only $4.3 million in Q1, even though it is expected to be the highest revenue quarter for the year. Moreover FCF remained weak at just $0.4 million. Stock based compensation remains high at close to $10 million annually, which makes me believe that achieving profitability on a GAAP basis is more likely to be beyond 2025. Despite SG&A expenses reducing to 19.8% of revenue in Q1, from 27.8% of revenue in the same period last year, volatility in gross margins makes it hard for me to see a clear path to the company achieving solid double-digit margins on the bottom line.\n\nCustomer concentration\n\nThe company derives a significant portion of its revenue from large customers. According to its 2023 Annual report, two of its largest customers accounted for 30% of its total revenue last year. If these customers were to reduce their spending, the company could see a severe impact. However in Redwire's case this risk is somewhat mitigated by the fact that these customers are mostly government organizations.\n\nValuation\n\nSince the company is expected to be unprofitable on a GAAP basis, I believe valuing the company based on EV to adjusted EBITDA and EV to Sales (EV/S) is more appropriate. Adjusted EBITDA can be considered a close proxy for FCF, when adjusting for capex and interest expenses which are running at roughly $12 million and $7 million annually, respectively. Management's guidance for this year calls for revenue of $300 million, which is believed to be a conservative number. In line with the trend in recent quarters, I assume that the company is able to achieve an adjusted EBITDA margin of 7% for the full year, which would result in an adjusted EBITDA of $21 million.\n\nWith a net debt of $60 million, and assuming its Convertible Preferred shares are fully converted, shares are valued at an EV to adjusted EBITDA multiple of 35, based on the current share price of $7. Correspondingly its EV/S multiple is 2.5. A much larger and vertically integrated peer Rocket Lab (RKLB), is also unprofitable but growing significantly faster and trades at an EV/S multiple close to 5. According to me, shares appear fairly priced when balancing the company's lack of profitability with its strong pipeline and backlog that supports high double-digit growth in the mid-term.\n\nConclusion\n\nShares appear to be fairly valued based on my current estimates. The company's solid order backlog coupled with its recent contract wins could potentially help it exceed management's current guidance, and carry this momentum into the next year. On the other hand, the significant risks that I've highlighted above make me stay with a Neutral rating.",

        "body": "Marvin Samuel Tolentino Pineda\n\nInvestment Thesis\n\nAmong the myriad of user preferences and consumer behaviors that have rapidly changed in the last few years, user consumption of TV content and online media has been at the forefront, with inflation being one of the primary factors forcing this rapid shift in media consumption behavior. Expeditious price hikes by many online streaming platforms have given way to the rise of free ad-supported streaming platforms like Roku\u2019s Roku Channel (NASDAQ:ROKU) or TubiTV by Fox (NASDAQ:FOX).\n\nRoku has not had it easy so far in 2024, after its horrible Q4 FY23 earnings report that could not build on the success of the preceding Q3 FY23 earnings report. Since the start of the year, Roku is now down 35% for the year, as seen in Exhibit A below.\n\nExhibit A: Roku is down 35% for the year as compared to the S&P 500 index (SA)\n\nI believe most of the fears have been priced in, and the company appears to have made some headway in gaining market share based on my analysis of NielsenIQ data, which puts Roku in a relatively favorable position in terms of risk/reward.\n\nFor now, I rate Roku as a Buy.\n\nRoku gains market share in TV Usage\n\nSince the torrid Q4 2023 report earlier this year, I see some positive signs emerging which swing in favor of Roku\u2019s business.\n\nFirst, Roku\u2019s namesake channel, the Roku Channel appears to have penetrated the market in terms of TV usage as seen in Exhibit B below. Per Nielsen\u2019s audience viewing behavior data, the Roku Channel has gained its market share in all time at 1.5% of TV usage in terms of minutes across all TV platforms.\n\nExhibit B: Roku\u2019s TV Channel gains all time high market share in TV usage in terms of minutes streamed (Nielsen Streaming Data)\n\nIn addition to that, other TV channels that offer free ad-supported content, such as Tubi, have also gained share, which points to users spending more minutes watching and browsing through Free Ad-Supported TV content or FAST content viewed on Roku\u2019s own channel and Tubi.\n\nThis also corresponds to the increase in Streaming Households on Roku\u2019s TV platforms across devices that are spending more Streaming Hours watching content on Roku\u2019s platform, as illustrated in Exhibit B below.\n\nExhibit C: Roku\u2019s business operational metrics (Q1 FY24 Investor Shareholder)\n\nAs seen in Exhibit C above, Streaming Hours have been rising steadily over the past few quarters and recorded a 23% bump in the most recent Q1 quarter. While ARPU did surprise markets with a 4.2% drop to $39.9 per user, that looks to have normalized to some extent in Q1 FY24. The rise of Streaming Hours along with the initial normalization of ARPU, allows Roku to sell ad inventory to advertisers at prices favorable to the platform, in my opinion.\n\nOpening Roku\u2019s ad platform will benefit the company\n\nSecond, Roku has also made some strong advances in furthering their ad business, which could benefit the platform in addition to the usage tailwinds that Roku has already witnessed in the last few months.\n\nMost recently, Roku launched their own ad exchange, allowing advertisers to buy and bid for ad inventory directly on Roku\u2019s platform. The availability of audience-based ad decision-making and programmatic ad buying features should make it more appealing for advertisers to spend on Roku\u2019s platform.\n\nIn addition, Roku also recently partnered with a leading DSP, Trade Desk (TTD), which opens up Roku\u2019s ad inventory to Trade Desk\u2019s large network of advertisers on the demand side. Most of these product announcements were made after Roku\u2019s Q1 earnings call, where management revealed their strategic efforts to open up Roku\u2019s platform to more advertisers rather than remaining a walled garden:\n\nThis strategic pivot has been paying real dividends. In the first quarter, we continued to see increase in programmatic ad spend as a percentage of total video investment on our platform, and that underscores for me the strength and appeal of our offering. Our strategy isn't just about expanding the platforms we operate on, it's also about deepening these relationships. So we're making it easier for advertisers to execute campaigns programmatically with us and easier for them to use Roku inventory.\n\nThese comments and subsequent initiatives by Roku tie into the high-level strategy that Roku\u2019s CEO articulated on the same call itself, where the company will be focusing on driving higher platform growth by driving higher ad demand as one of the priorities.\n\nAs can be seen in Exhibit D below, platform revenue growth has been key for Roku, which grew 74% CAGR between FY19 and FY21 but increased in the mid-teens on a CAGR basis between FY21 and now.\n\nExhibit D: Roku\u2019s platform revenue growth accounts for 86% of Roku\u2019s total revenue and has slowed significantly since during the pandemic. (Company sources)\n\nI believe Roku would be on the right track to open up their ad system to more advertisers and DSPs, and the added benefit of increasing usage on Roku\u2019s platform by users would incentivize advertisers to spend more on the platform moving forward.\n\nValuation appears to have priced in the worst\n\nThe company appears to be profitable on an adjusted basis, but I will value the company using sales forecasts via traditional metrics such as price/sales or EV/sales.\n\nI believe the company could achieve sales growth of ~10% over the next two years through FY25, as the expansion of Roku\u2019s ad platform products could increase ad spend on the platform, supported by sustained market share of the company\u2019s channel and platform. Unfortunately, investors appear to be extremely pessimistic about Roku when I observe the company trading at 2.3x forward sales on a price/sales basis or 1.7x forward sales on an EV/sales basis.\n\nExhibit E: Roku\u2019s forward sales estimates indicated depressed investor sentiment (yCharts)\n\nCompared to Roku, the S&P500\u2019s long-term expected growth rate is usually ~4.8% and trades at a forward sales multiple of 2.2x. On a relative basis, this points to significant upside in Roku as the company enters H2 of 2024.\n\nI believe there is room for Roku\u2019s valuation multiples to expand to at least 4-5x based on the sales growth I am forecasting for Roku this year.\n\nRisks & other factors to consider\n\nCompetition will be key to watch as we move into H2 not only in the devices space, where different streaming devices and TV OEMs, especially low-cost OEMs, compete directly with Roku\u2019s streaming device products, but also in the ad space, where Roku may not be able to get a share of the ad budgets that it vies for via its recent slate of ad products. For now, most of the competition on the device side is priced in, but I will be closely watching the performance and commentary on the reception Roku\u2019s ad products are receiving from advertisers.\n\nIt is also important for Roku to demonstrate higher ARPU moving forward. On the Q4 FY23 earnings call, management mentioned that ARPU had taken a hit due to a surge in streaming users from international geographies, especially in regions like Mexico and Brazil. While the company does not break out ARPU by region, management revealed that ARPU of North American users was flat, but the company will need to do more to provide just anecdotes of ARPU moving forward, especially because the company has thin adjusted EBITDA margins of under 5%.\n\nTakeaway\n\nWhile risks do persist in Roku\u2019s path to transitioning into an H2 winner, I am encouraged by the progress the company has demonstrated in penetrating TV usage minutes as well as deploying more ad products that should make it more appealing for advertisers to increase spending on the platform.\n\nThis positions Roku as a winner in the second half of FY24 and I recommend buying Roku.",

        "title": "Calix: A Disruptor In A Mature Industry (NYSE:CALX)",
        "body": "Huber & Starke\n\nInvestment overview\n\nI give a buy rating to Calix, Inc. (NYSE:CALX). CALX next-generation products enable its customers to compete effectively against incumbents and also at a lower cost structure. Demand for the CALX product is evident through its historical growth rates, customer operating metrics improvements, and adoption by Verizon (a large tier-1 customer). I don\u2019t think the recent slowdown is representative of CALX growth, as it is being dragged down by temporal headwinds. As CALX moves past this weak period, growth should inflect back upward.\n\nBusiness description\n\nCalix provides broadband service providers (BSPs) with hardware, cloud, and software platforms, systems, and services that gather, analyze, and return data from their respective subscriber bases that can offer direction for the BSPs to best improve their customer experiences and help reduce operating expenses. Breaking down revenue by geography, CALX is primarily focused on the US markets, where it derives more than 90% of revenue as of FY23. In terms of customer base, CALX core customers are the small BSPs (81% of total revenue) that have less than 250 thousand underlying subscribers.\n\nCALX is a disruptor to a mature industry\n\nThe broadband service provider industry is a mature industry that is arguably commoditized in terms of service offerings, and it really boils down to who can service the customer better. In the past, BSPs were able to differentiate themselves by bundling on-demand video and live sports, and this advantage is mostly available to large players as they have more financial resources and a larger subscriber base to amortize the fixed cost. Fast forward to today, and the arrival of over-the-top players like Netflix, Disney+, and direct live sports streaming (ESPN Live, NBA League Pass, etc.) has basically crippled BSPs ability to differentiate to a large extent.\n\nCALX\n\nI believe CALX next-generation products are major disruptors in that they provide BSPs with a way to differentiate themselves and compete more effectively. CALX does this by simplifying the hardware platform (i.e., the underlying infrastructure), wherein CALX focuses on delivering a platform that can deliver the required capabilities while at the same time reducing the reliance on hardware.\n\nEssentially, the next-generation products include AXOS, EXOS, and Calix Cloud. AXOS and EXOS are operating systems based on software-defined networking that sit on top of the network and simplify network operations. In simpler terms, AXOS and EXOS use software modules to virtualize various hardware functions. This is huge for BSPs because:\n\nReduces churn by achieving greater network reliability: hardware goes through wear and tear, and they eventually break down, which is a hassle because it disrupts operations. From the customer perspective, they don\u2019t care about the underlying reason for network disruption. Any disruption will be blamed on the network brand, which leads to a bad reputation and an increase in customer churn. This is especially hurtful for smaller BSPs that need to rely on a lot of customer service to differentiate themselves (they don\u2019t really have other ways to compete since the products they offer are commoditized). Faster upgrades with no disruption: BSPs are able to conduct upgrades without having to take hardware offline, which is a huge positive, as they don\u2019t need to risk subscribers' dissatisfaction. Also, it is a lot easier and cheaper to just update software (with a couple of clicks) rather than deploying hundreds of man-hours to upgrade each piece of hardware. Lastly, because CALX platforms are hardware-agnostic, it allows BSPs to swap out hardware from a different vendor anytime they want. This relieves them of any price increase from incumbent hardware providers (assuming there is a cheaper alternative).\n\nThrough all of these, CALX allows BSPs to achieve significant cost savings (lower subscriber churn, smoother network operations, and less labor needed). Another benefit is that this gives BSPs more room to compete on price.\n\nCALX\n\nThe adoption of CALX platform enables BSPs to take advantage of Calix Cloud (the other next-gen product mentioned above). Calix Cloud is an analytics platform that has two main products: the marketing cloud and the support cloud. The key thing here is the network and subscriber behavior data that CALX is able to capture and provide BSPs. This opens up a lot of revenue growth opportunities for BSPs, where they can now identify which subscribers are most likely open to upgrades or new services.\n\nAdditionally, BSPs are able to step up on customer service now that they have better visibility into subscribers\u2019 behavior. Through the Support Cloud module, BSPs support team can quickly identify issues with the network or equipment. It even has automation capabilities that fix many common issues without manual intervention. This eventually drives down the overall operating cost of BSPs as they do not need to deploy manpower to fix the issue on-site, and it also reduces customer churn as subscribers remain satisfied.\n\nCALX\n\nGiven that this is a disruptive model, the question is whether there is strong demand for it and if the products do work. The most solid evidence for strong demand can be seen from CALX Financials, where revenue from its small customer base saw exceptional growth post-launch of these next-gen products (revenue grew from $294 million in FY19 to $764 million in FY23). In terms of whether the product works, I believe the improvements in operating metrics for CALX customers (as shown above) are a great proof of that. Finally, the fact that Verizon, a large tier-1 BSP, decided to deploy AXOS is a very big statement. Moreover, CALX is the sole supplier for Verizon, which lends further credence to CALX's product quality and value proposition.\n\nWhy did growth slow recently?\n\nThe market clearly recognizes CALX's ability to disrupt the market, as the stock surged from sub-$10 to $80 between 2020 and late 2021. However, the stock took a beating afterwards as growth plummeted from -9% in 1Q24 to ~30% in FY20/21/22. This is an interesting set-up for investors because there is no structural change to the CALX products or long-term growth potential. What caused the slowdown was the weak macro environment\u2014basically, high interest rates\u2014that drove up the cost of capital for many BSPs (causing them to delay deployment). Remember that CALX main customer cohorts are small BSPs, and as such, increases in rates have a huge impact on them vs. tier-1 BSPs. On top of that, the difficult process with the BEAD program is another reason I believe is causing delay in purchasing decisions as customers are still evaluating how to leverage this program.\n\nThe way I see it, this situation is more of a temporal slowdown. It should get better when the macro situation recovers and when there is more progress with the BEAD program (so far, four states have completed all steps). What investors should note to take their eyes off is that Calx continues to win customers despite this soft environment. In 1Q24, they added 10 new BSPs and managed to secure its largest ever cloud deal.\n\n1Q24 results and my expectation for 2Q24\n\nIn CALX latest quarter (1Q24), the business reported revenue of $226 million which was in-line with consensus of $228 million, and management\u2019s guided range of $225 to $231 million. Meanwhile, gross margin was to 54.9%, beating consensus modestly by 50bps but in-line with the guided range of 53.5% to 55.5%, driven by better product mix. At the EBIT line, CALX reported a margin of 7%, beating consensus estimate of 6.7%, and this drove an EPS result of $0.21. Overall, 1Q24 was another slow quarter that did not show any major progress that customers were stepping up in deployment. Balance sheet wise, the good thing is that CALX is in a net cash position of $64 million. Given that CALX is also profitable, despite the poor demand today, there should be no risk of capital raise in the foreseeable future.\n\nAs for 2Q24 (set to be released in a couple of weeks), I am not expecting any major turnaround in demand as well, given how the economic situation is, and that management has already guided for further slowdown.\n\nValuation\n\nCALX\n\nMay Investing Ideas\n\nMay Investing Ideas\n\nBased on my research and analysis, my expected target price for CALX is $64 (CALX traded at ~$60 levels in early 2023).\n\nAs I view the slowdown in growth as a temporary one, I am modeling revenue to inflect back to management medium-term guidance post FY24. As for FY24, I am expecting the rest of the year to see poor performance, as it is unlikely for the macro situation to recover. Assuming 2Q24 guidance for $200 stays flat for the rest of the year, I got to $826 million in revenue for FY24.\n\nCALX should see poor EBITDA performance in FY24 as well, given the major slowdown in growth. The guidance provided in 2Q24 implies ~1.3% EBIT margin, which is about 3% EBITDA margin using historical EBITDA to EBIT delta. Assuming 2H24 has the average EBITDA margin of 1H24, I got to around 6.2% EBITDA margin for FY24. That said, once we get past this weak period, I expect EBITDA margins to inflect back to the mid-teens range where they used to trade.\n\nI don\u2019t see any upside to multiples from here, as CALX is already trading at its average multiple (it seems to me that the market is already pricing in some sort of recovery). The upside for the stock will largely stem from EBITDA growth.\n\nRisk\n\nThe risk is industry consolidation. Given that CALX customers are mainly in the lower-tier cohort, when tier 1 customers acquire them, it is likely that they will stop using CALX as they integrate with their own operating systems. While I expect growth to recover in FY25, the current turmoil could take a lot longer than expected to resolve, and that would delay the timeline to recovery, potentially causing the stock to get hit again as the market resets expectations.\n\nConclusion\n\nI give a buy rating for CALX. I see CALX as a disruptor in the mature BSP industry with its next-generation products. These products enable BSPs to compete more effectively through improved customer service, and also increase monetization opportunities. These lead to reduced churn, streamlined operations, and lower operating costs. While the recent slowdown is concerning, I believe it is temporary due to the weak macro environment and the BEAD program uncertainties.",

Analysts expected Tesla deliveries to hit 439,000 in the three months ending June 30, according to a consensus of estimates compiled by FactSet Street Account. The total number of deliveries in the second quarter was down 4.8% from 466,140 a year earlier.\n\nTroy Teslike, an independent researcher widely followed by Tesla fans, predicted deliveries of 423,000 for the quarter.\n\nDeliveries are the closest approximation of sales disclosed by the electric vehicle maker. Tesla groups deliveries into two categories \u2014 Model 3 and Model Y vehicles, and all other vehicles \u2014 but doesn\u2019t report numbers for individual models or specific regions.\n\nTesla\u2019s current lineup includes its popular Model Y crossover utility vehicles, Model 3 sedans and the new Cybertruck pickups, as well as the Model X SUV and flagship Model S sedan.\n\nIn April, Tesla reported a drop of 8.5% in first-quarter deliveries to 386,810, the first annual decline since 2020. Weeks later the company reported 13% decline in year-over-year revenue for the quarter, \u201cprimarily due to lower average selling price.\u201d\n\nSluggish sales were in part the result of temporary factory shut downs initiated in response to an alleged arson attack at Tesla\u2019s factory in Germany, as well as shipping delays following Red Sea conflicts, Tesla said.\n\nBut the sales drop also correlated with Tesla\u2019s aging lineup of vehicles, increased competition from other EV makers especially in China, and brand erosion that one recent survey attributed partly to CEO Elon Musk\u2019s \u201cantics\u201d and \u201cpolitical rants.\u201d\n\nTesla shares are down 16% in 2024 even after rallying 6% on Monday.\n\nTesla has offered a range of discounts and other incentives this year to try spur sales.\n\nIn China, Tesla is currently offering a zero-interest loan as an incentive to get customers to buy a Model 3 or Model Y by July 31. According to its 2023 annual filing, Tesla generated about $21.75 billion of its overall revenue from China, representing 22.5% of total sales.\n\nColin Langan, an analyst at Wells Fargo, issued a report on Monday, saying the firm sees \u201cdeclining delivery growth driven by lower demand & diminished return on price cuts.\u201d He recommends selling Tesla shares.\n\nWells Fargo expects automotive gross margins at Tesla, not including environmental credits, to fall given the \u201clikelihood of more price cuts & lower volumes\u201d as the year continues.\n\nInvestor focus will now shift to Tesla\u2019s second-quarter earnings report later this month, and a separate marketing event planned for August, when the company intends to reveal its design for a dedicated robotaxi or \u201cCyberCab.\u201d\n\nSource: https://www.cnbc.com/2024/07/02/tesla-tsla-q2-2024-vehicle-delivery-and-production-numbers.html",

Still, EVs made up only 3.2% of its total second-quarter sales.\n\nSales of GM\u2019s full-size pickup trucks were roughly 229,000 during the second quarter, up about 6% from a year earlier and the best quarterly sales since 2021.\n\nGM\u2019s total sales through the first half of the year were down 0.4%, however, compared to a year earlier to roughly 1.3 million vehicles.\n\nGM\u2019s second-quarter sales are expected to slightly outpace the overall industry. Auto industry forecasters such as Cox Automotive and Edmunds expect second-quarter sales industrywide, including July 1, to be roughly level from a year earlier amid slowing retail demand.\n\nAn unknown outlier in the second quarter is how much of an effect cyberattacks on dealer software provider CDK Global will have on sales. The June 19 ransomware attack forced CDK, a market leader, to shut down its dealer management system, affecting close to half of all dealerships in North America.\n\n\u201cThe CDK cyberattacks have thrown a monkey wrench into sales during the second half of June, affecting what is arguably one of the most lucrative and busiest times of the month and quarter for dealerships,\u201d said Jessica Caldwell, Edmunds\u2019 head of insights.\n\nGM, in a statement, said its \u201cdealers who use the CDK platform are working to meet strong customer demand under difficult circumstances. Some deliveries may be delayed until Q3.\u201d\n\nDealers, including the industry\u2019s largest publicly traded ones, were forced to delay sales or figure out workarounds to sell vehicles since the attacks occurred.\n\nAll six of the major publicly traded franchised dealership groups have disclosed their exposure to the CDK issue. Five of the six \u2014 Asbury Automotive Group, AutoNation Inc., Group 1 Automotive Inc., Lithia Motors Inc. and Sonic Automotive Inc. \u2014 use CDK as their primary dealership management system provider, according to Automotive News.\n\n\u201cThe good news is \u2014 unlike other black swan events that the industry has contended with in the past \u2014 sales shouldn\u2019t be lost or severely deferred, but rather pushed into the third quarter,\u201d Caldwell said.\n\nSeparately on Tuesday, Toyota reported its second-quarter sales. The company\u2019s U.S. sales totaled 621,549 vehicles during the period, up 9.2% compared to a year earlier.\n\nThe Hyundai brand sold 214,719 vehicles during the second quarter, up 2.2% compared to a year earlier.\n\nKia, which reports sales on a monthly basis, reported a 6.5% decrease in its June sales. Its sales for the first half of the year were down about 2% to 386,460 vehicles sold.\n\nSource: https://www.cnbc.com/2024/07/02/gm-q2-2024-auto-sales.html",

        "body": "Salesforce investors voted against the company\u2019s compensation plan for top executives, after shareholder advisory groups raised concerns about equity awards granted to CEO Marc Benioff.\n\nAccording to a regulatory filing on Monday, the resolution to approve the compensation received 339.3 million votes in favor and 404.8 million against at the annual meeting held on Thursday.\n\nThe board had urged shareholders to vote in favor of the resolution. But two shareholder advisory firms, Glass Lewis and Institutional Shareholder Services, both recommended that investors vote down the measure.\n\nFor the 2024 fiscal year, Benioff received $39.6 million in total pay, up from $29.9 million in the prior year. While Benioff\u2019s salary was flat at $1.55 million, he received additional stock and option awards and nonequity incentive plan compensation, according to the proxy statement. The most recent sum also included security fees that had not previously been invoiced to the company.\n\nIn January, the board\u2019s compensation committee gave Benioff a second long-term equity award worth $20 million, in recognition of the company\u2019s \u201csuccessful transformation actions and strong financial performance in the fiscal year,\u201d among other factors.\n\nGlass Lewis wrote in its recommendation that \u201cshareholders may reasonably be wary of the substantial discretionary equity grants\u201d issued to Benioff in January, adding that there was a \u201clack of a fully convincing rationale\u201d behind the grants.\n\nBenioff was already among the largest holders of Salesforce, with a stake of over 2% valued at close to $6 billion. Glass Lewis said in its proxy paper that the additional performance-based restricted stock units and stock options were \u201cunwarranted\u201d because his interests were already aligned with that of shareholders.\n\nThe vote from the annual meeting is nonbinding.\n\n\u201cOur Compensation Committee, which is responsible for designing and administering our executive compensation program, values the opinions expressed by our stockholders and will consider the outcome of this vote when making future executive compensation decisions,\u201d Salesforce\u2019s board said in the company\u2019s proxy statement.\n\nThe company declined to comment.\n\nSalesforce shares rose 67% in the 2024 fiscal year ended Jan. 31, the strongest performance since 2011.\n\nNet income jumped to $4.1 billion in the fiscal year from $208 million a year earlier, while revenue increased 11% to $34.9 billion from $31.4 billion. In January 2023, Salesforce announced plans to lay off 10% of employees, after activist investors began buying up stakes and demanding a better mix of profit and growth. Salesforce said in February it would begin paying a dividend to shareholders.\n\nSalesforce shares are off 2.6% year to date.\n\nSource: https://www.cnbc.com/2024/07/01/salesforce-shareholders-vote-against-compensation-for-top-executives.html",

I just realized something I never really thought of before, because I was not a huge seller so far. My performance would have been much better without taking tax hits from selling stocks.\n\nI am from Europe, tax hit is about 26% on all gains above 1000\u20ac(annually) when selling. I mean, I knew it before, but I just realized it this year, as my tax hits are 4 figures now. I do understand more and more why Warren B. says \u201cIf you aren't thinking about owning a stock for ten years, don't even think about owning it for ten minutes.\u201d The most important part is really to not interrupt compounding.\n\nTake for example AAPL. \u20ac10k invested in AAPL in January would be +17% \u20ac11.7k. You would have beaten the market when holding. If you sell: \u20ac1.7k gains 26% taxed left about \u20ac11.25k left. You would be up only up about 11% and been beaten by the index after selling. Index-funds have the big advantage, that they get taxed only at the very end, that way you don't interrupt compounding. I mean this is no rocket science and I am dumb to realize this only now, but the recent tax hits really opened my eyes.\n\nTo end this post with something useful: How is your portfolio doing? Have you beaten the S&P? What's your % YTD?\n\nTLDR: Tax on my investments is destroys my gains. Never interrupt compounding, unless it's absolutely necessary.",

At that time, Tesla will issue a brief advisory containing a link to the Q2 2024 update, which will be available on Tesla\u2019s Investor Relations website.

The total number of deliveries in the second quarter fell 4.8% from 466,140 a year earlier but rose 14.8% from the first quarter.\n\nThe stock rose more than 9% Tuesday in midday trading.

The educated estimates should be ranging from 415K to 420K, implying at least 9% YoY decline.\n\nRecall in January 2024's investor call that Mr. CEO was saying TSLA is between two major growth waves while no further guidance was provided (very tricky to be honest), does it mean \"low growth\" or actually \"no growth\"?\n\nMore information will be followed post the release of 2024Q2 numbers ...\n\nTesla deliveries set to fall for second straight quarter\n\nhttps://www.reuters.com/business/autos-transportation/tesla-deliveries-set-fall-second-straight-quarter-2024-07-01\n\nTesla's June-quarter deliveries likely fell 6%, the first time the top EV maker is set to post two straight quarters of decline, as it deals with stiff competition in China and slow demand due to a lack of affordable new models.\n\nThe company is expected to deliver 438,019 vehicles for the April to June period, according to an average estimate based on forecasts from 12 analysts polled by LSEG, seven of whom slashed their expectations in the past three months. The EV maker is expected to announce the results on Tuesday.\n\nTesla has hit a speed bump after years of rapid growth that helped make it the world's most valuable automaker.

        "body": "Paramount Global is holding talks with other entertainment companies about merging its Paramount+ streaming service with an existing platform. If it reaches a deal, it may kick off a new wave of streaming partnerships that could put the entire media industry on firmer footing.\n\nParamount Global leadership is having active discussions with other media and tech company executives to determine if a structure makes sense for both parties where Paramount+ can be merged with another streaming entity and potentially co-owned, according to people familiar with the matter, who asked not to be named because the discussions are private.\n\nOne of the companies that has expressed a desire to reach a deal is Warner Bros. Discovery, according to people familiar with the matter. Combining Max and Paramount+ could strengthen both services by allowing them to better compete with Netflix and Disney\u2019s suite of platforms (Disney+, Hulu and ESPN) for eyeballs and future content.\n\nWarner Bros. Discovery held preliminary merger talks for a deal for all of Paramount Global earlier this year, but talks didn\u2019t escalate.\n\nParamount Global is also considering partnering with a technology platform, the company\u2019s co-CEO Chris McCarthy said at an employee town hall on June 25.\n\n\u201cWhat they don\u2019t have is our scale of content, and together we will make for a very powerful combination to drive more minutes and greater profits,\u201d McCarthy said of a potential tech partner at the town hall, according to a transcript of the event obtained by CNBC.\n\nA merged streaming service would mitigate churn by giving customers more diverse programming and fewer reasons to cancel each month, and it could take Paramount+ losses off Paramount Global\u2019s balance sheet by giving it new ownership.\n\nWhile a structure for a hypothetical joint venture with Warner Bros. Discovery hasn\u2019t been discussed in detail, ownership likely wouldn\u2019t be a 50-50 split given the existing natures of the streaming assets and their finances, according to people familiar with the discussions.\n\nWarner Bros. Discovery\u2019s direct-to-consumer business made $103 million in annual adjusted EBITDA in 2023 after losing $2.1 billion the year before. Paramount Global reported a loss of $1.67 billion in direct-to-consumer operating income before depreciation and amortization in 2023, narrower than its $1.8 billion loss a year prior.\n\nMax has about 100 million global subscribers, with 52.7 million based in the U.S. Paramount+ ended its first quarter with 71 million subscribers.\n\nComcast\u2019s NBCUniversal has also expressed interest in a joint venture with Paramount+, as The Wall Street Journal first reported earlier this year. The talks didn\u2019t progress and never got particularly far, according to people familiar with the matter.\n\n\u201cThe sheer volume of hit content that we could offer together would be tremendous across TV, film and sports, and would attract millions of viewers,\u201d McCarthy said during the town hall in reference to a potential partnership with an existing subscription streaming service like Max or Peacock. \u201cPlus, we would share in all other non-content expenses.\u201d\n\nSpokespeople for Warner Bros. Discovery, NBCUniversal and Paramount Global declined to comment.\n\nStreaming 2.0\n\nSince late 2019, traditional media companies including Paramount Global, Disney, NBCUniversal and Warner Bros. Discovery have all launched streaming services that have hemorrhaged billions of dollars in losses.\n\nThere\u2019s long been consensus in the industry that there are too many streaming services relative to the number of total paying customers. Many executives have speculated that just four or five global services can likely survive and flourish. The others would need to be consolidated or folded into existing platforms.\n\n\u201cThere may be some combination of Paramount, Peacock and Max,\u201d said Peter Chernin, former CEO and chairman of Fox Group, in an interview with CNBC last year.\n\nIf Paramount reaches an agreement on a joint venture with either Max or Peacock, there would be added pressure on whichever service is left out to do a deal of its own.\n\nMedia companies are now focused on better monetizing streaming content through bundles and partnerships. Disney and Warner Bros. Discovery have recently become more willing to license some of their content to rival streaming services, such as Netflix, to better monetize shows that aren\u2019t adding a lot of new subscribers to their streaming services.\n\nComcast recently introduced a bundle of Peacock, Netflix and Apple TV+ for its cable, broadband and mobile customers for $15 a month.\n\nDisney and Warner Bros. Discovery announced they plan to bundle their streaming services beginning in the summer. While the companies haven\u2019t yet announced a price for the package, which will include Disney+, Hulu and Max, the discount will be \u201csignificant,\u201d according to one of the people familiar with the matter.\n\nBetter windowing\n\nAnother hot topic of current discussions revolve around windowing movies and TV series through different streaming services at different price points.\n\nThis idea was something considered by Skydance Media, which nearly acquired Paramount Global before talks broke down last month.\n\nSkydance\u2019s plan for Paramount included merging Paramount+ with another streamer to create new streaming services which would better rationalize the assets, according to people familiar with the matter.\n\nFor example, Paramount\u2019s Showtime library could be combined with another company\u2019s prestige dramas to create a stand-alone ad-free service.\n\nA different ad-supported service could then contain live sports and windowed prestige originals, which could appear on the second service after a certain amount of time. The services could be bundled together, such as how Disney bundles Disney+, Hulu and ESPN+.\n\nA representative for Skydance declined to comment.\n\nOne app experience\n\nThere\u2019s a widespread shared sentiment among traditional media leadership that better packaging of existing content can be more lucrative for the entire industry.\n\nThe downside to more bundling or windowing of content is customer confusion. Increased mix-and-match offers between streaming services can easily lead to customer frustration rather than satisfaction.\n\nSeveral media executives said privately they expect Peacock, Paramount+, Max and Disney could ultimately team up their programming within one application to alleviate confusion and compete with Netflix, which dominates the subscription streaming industry with about 270 million global subscribers.\n\nTwo executives said Disney would be the most likely company to own the application, given its relative dominant position in the entertainment streaming industry. Any media company who contributed content to the streaming application could share in the revenue, similar to how cable economics work today, they added.\n\nStill, company rivalries and tensions may make such a product difficult to put together. While Max and Disney have struck a bundling deal, Comcast and Disney have long had a strained relationship. The two parties are currently trying to unwind a joint venture \u2014 Hulu \u2014 to give Disney full control over the service that was initially co-owned by NBCUniversal, Fox and Disney.\n\nSource: https://www.cnbc.com/2024/07/01/paramount-streaming-merger-talks.html",

        "body": "Boeing said Monday that it will buy back its struggling fuselage maker Spirit AeroSystems in an all-stock deal that the planemaker has said will improve safety and quality control.\n\nIt said it agreed to pay $37.25 a share in Boeing stock for Spirit, giving the aerospace company an equity value of $4.7 billion. Including Spirit\u2019s debt the deal has a transaction value of $8.3 billion Boeing said. Spirit\u2019s shares closed Friday at $32.87 a share, giving it a market capitalization of about $3.8 billion.\n\nBoeing in March disclosed that it was in talks to acquire the Wichita, Kansas-based company, weeks after a fuselage panel blew out midair from a nearly new Boeing 737 Max 9 on an Alaska Airlines flight, sparking a fresh crisis for Boeing. Spirit makes the fuselages for the 737 and other parts, including sections of Boeing\u2019s 787 Dreamliners.\n\nIn 2005, Boeing spun off operations in Kansas and Oklahoma that became the present-day Spirit AeroSystems. Boeing accounted for about 70% of Spirit\u2019s revenue last year, while roughly a quarter came from making parts for Boeing\u2019s main rival, Airbus, according to a securities filing.\n\nCEO Dave Calhoun, who has said he will step down at the end of the year, on Monday said bringing Spirit in-house will \u201cfully align\u201d the companies\u2019 production systems and workforces.\n\n\u201cAmong the many actions we\u2019re taking as a company, this is one of the most significant in demonstrating our unwavering commitment to strengthen quality and make certain that Boeing is the company the world needs it to be,\u201d Dave Calhoun said in a message to employees.\n\nHe said he expects the deal to close mid-2025, subject to approval by regulators, Spirit shareholders and the sale of Spirit\u2019s operators dedicated to Airbus planes.\n\nSpirit\u2019s CEO Pat Shanahan is considered a possible replacement for Calhoun.\n\nAirbus, meanwhile, said Monday it has reached an agreement with Spirit so that the European aircraft manufacturer is compensated $559 million by Spirit to acquire its manufacturing lines dedicated to Airbus planes. Those include operations in Belfast, Northern Ireland, where the wings and mid-fuselage of the A220 is produced, A220 pylons in Wichita, Kansas, and A350 fuselage sections in North Carolina.\n\nMounting pressure\n\nA preliminary report from the National Transportation Safety Board into the Jan. 5 accident said it appeared the bolts that hold the door plug in place weren\u2019t attached to the Max 9 when it left Boeing\u2019s factory and was handed over to Alaska Airlines months before the accident.\n\nThat was the most serious of a host of production problems on Boeing planes, which also included Spirit-made fuselages that had misdrilled holes and misconnected fuselage panels.\n\nThe crisis stemming from the door-plug blowout on the Alaska flight has slowed Boeing\u2019s deliveries of new planes to airlines, and has driven financial hits for both Spirit and Boeing. Boeing\u2019s CFO in May said the company would burn, rather than generate cash this year\u2014about $8 billion in the first half of 2024. Boeing\u2019s shares are down more than 30% this year.\n\nOne way Boeing has tried to improve quality is to accept only fuselages without defects so that repairs or additional manufacturing steps won\u2019t have to be made out of sequence, reducing the changes of errors.\n\nThe Federal Aviation Administration has said it won\u2019t let Boeing expand production until it is satisfied with its production lines.\n\nCalhoun was skewered by lawmakers in a June Senate hearing over the company\u2019s safety record and what some Senators lamented was a lack of improvement in the wake of two deadly Max crashes.\n\nSource: https://www.cnbc.com/2024/07/01/boeing-to-buy-spirit-aerosystems.html",

For everyone who said it wasn\u2019t his tweet that made the stock spike from 28 ->39 or that CHWY spiked before DFV posted.\n\nGME- Fell likely due to DFV\u2019s reveal of his stake in CHWY. (WOOF as well)\n\nSPR- BA agrees to buy SPR in $4.7B deal, SPR makes fuselages (the main body) for planes.\n\nNKE- Earnings last Thursday, cut full-year guidance and said it expects sales to drop 10% during current quarter. I\u2019m watching to see if we bounce at the open.

        "body": "See what I did there? ;)\n\nI\u2019d be lying if I didn\u2019t say I was a little butthurt by Cramer calling this software stock \u201ca falling knife\u2026\u201d\n\nC\u2019mon, Cramer! You\u2019re supposed to be my guy!\n\nIf you\u2019ve been long with Unity Software ($U) for a while now, I\u2019m sorry about the hit its taken on your portfolio YTD.\n\nHowever, I come to give the trading community of Reddit some reassurance as to why there\u2019s still upside to be had with these guys - and this is the most ideal time to buy.\n\nUnity Software Inc. is most-known for their software products that provide real-time 3D content to video game developers.\n\nTheir technology, the Unity Engine, is spread across various product/subscription options offered by the company, and is responsible for the development of popular games such as Among Us, Subnautica, Rust, Cuphead, and free or cheap-to-play games.\n\nTheir most notable products are known as Unity Pro (for professional game developers), Unity Plus (for indie games), Unity Ads (for monetization of your web service) and more. These products span further than the video-game industry, garnering their artificial intelligence development within the automotive, film, and engineering industries as well.\n\nWhat\u2019s unique is Unity Software\u2019s business model - the business is split into Operate Solutions, which is responsible for their ad revenue, in-app purchases and other tools, Create Solutions (where revenue is driven from the Unity Engine), and Strategic Partnerships.\n\nOver the last two years, the Create Solutions segment has been the largest source of income to the revenue figure. However, the growth rate of that revenue figure is crashing\u2026\n\n25.23% growth from 2021 to 2022, 15.11% from 2022 to 2023, and a 32% decrease from their year-open share price of $38.79/share are all terrible nods from the fundamental section.\n\nFurthermore, Unity\u2019s EBITDA and free cash flow have seen significant increases over the course of 2024 as well.\n\nBut a popular AI/Software stock researcher and I still speculate this is a \u201cbuy the dip\u201d opportunity.\n\nA primary speculative reason for the fall of $U is the raised subscription service cost. Developers who use Unity Software to develop and distribute their games have to pay a subscription fee for the distribution and development.\n\nTowards the end of 2023, interim CEO Jim Whitehurst raised the subscription fee on the developers using their engine to make gains, ultimately driving a short spurt to the revenue figure.\n\nAlthough it did give a boost to the total, this added charge pissed off a LOT of developers, causing $U to fall all the way down to where we are today - a mere $16/share, after Unity reported an EPS of -$1.83 for their shareholders in 2023.\n\nAll of that said, the bad man is now gone everybody\u2026\n\nTomorrow, 7/3, Matt Bromberg will take the reins of Unity Software Inc. as the newly appointed president and CEO.\n\nBromberg brings over 20 years of service in the gaming industry as he is formerly the COO of Zynga, and had other leadership positions before this with Electronic Arts.\n\nBefore both of these ventures, Bromberg served as the President and CEO of Major League Gaming, where he played a monster role in the esports revolution.\n\nWhile running the show at Unity, Bromberg will continue to hold his positions at Monzo, Blast, and Fitbit, which are all tech companies spanning across various market sectors.\n\nBromberg has a heart for the gamer, not to mention, their developers - and its alleged his plan is to lower the fee on their subscription service to open the gates to the next \u201cAmong Us\u201d developer.\n\nI personally think \u201cthe falling knife\u201d was caused by lack of customer appreciation from leadership; a change in leadership could be the spark $U needs to light a fire on the bottom wick of the stick ;)\n\nAnalysts are projecting a $0.13 EPS for their Q2 earnings call - a decrease from the previous years projection of $0.17. Unity Software hasn\u2019t missed projections on this front for some time, and have even turned in an average 56% surprise factor since Q2 of last year.\n\nAlthough analysts are projecting a +20% growth in their revenue year-over-year, what will be most interesting to see is if Unity will be able to turn around their plummeting profit margins by the end of the year.\n\nI added shares to my position with $U today, with the change in leadership set to go tomorrow, this might be the last time to \u201cbuy the dip,\u201d and when the next hit mobile game comes out, I\u2019m hoping to have a little \u201ctold-you-so\u201d moment in the back pocket.\n\nIt\u2019s speculation, but it's optimistic.\n\nLet me know if you guys have a position, long or short, with $U 2! (See what I did there again \u263a\ufe0f)\n\nHope you got something valuable here ~ always NFA\n\nSources:\n\n1 2",

If you are on old reddit, click \u201cshow images\u201d at the top to see all the charts quickly.\n\nI usually make these watchlists premarket, but can be delayed if I am trading the open. These are not mean to be taken as gospel or any recommendation to buy/sell.\n\nMany stocks I post are <$500M market cap. These are potentially good candidates to day trade; I have no opinion on them as investments. PLEASE ask specific ones. Questions like \u201cThoughts on _____?\u201d will be ignored unless you add detail to the question. \u201cIs ___ a good investment?\u201d will be ignored.

Obviously I might just be doing coinflips but interested in what my opinions match up with market performance day to day.)\n\nI\u2019ll likely not be posting on Wednesday because the market closes early, and those days are typically pretty slow. Happy early fourth of July everyone!\n\nTSLA- Released Q2 TSLA delivery numbers: 15% growth compared to last quarter, 5% year over year. We broke the 220 level premarket after I wrote this so will see where this goes at the open.\n\nCHWY- SEC filing reveals 6.6% stake by DFV (yesterday\u2019s news). We saw this sell off at the open, I\u2019m watching the $25 level but selling could return.\n\nPARA- Up from news of potential streaming merger talks, potentially with Max.\n\nNVO- Supposedly cut prices on Ozempic/Wegovy medications\n\nNKE- Earnings last Thursday, cut full-year guidance and said it expects sales to drop 10% during current quarter. We never bounced at the open yesterday but I have a small position in this, likely going to hold this for a swing trade.\n\nAMZN- I know I said I\u2019d take this off the list yesterday but we\u2019re STILL near that $200 level.

If you are on old reddit, click \u201cshow images\u201d at the top to see all the charts quickly.\n\nI usually make these watchlists premarket, but can be delayed if I am trading the open. These are not mean to be taken as gospel or any recommendation to buy/sell.\n\nMany stocks I post are <$500M market cap. These are potentially good candidates to day trade; I have no opinion on them as investments. PLEASE ask specific ones. Questions like \u201cThoughts on _____?\u201d will be ignored unless you add detail to the question. \u201cIs ___ a good investment?\u201d will be ignored. I will block you if you are a troll.\n\nNews: Biden Allies Dismiss Calls to Quit in Frenetic Weekend Blitz\n\nI\u2019ll likely not be posting on Wednesday because the market closes early, and those days are typically pretty slow. Happy early fourth of July everyone!\n\nCHWY- SEC filing reveals 6.6% stake by DFV. Watching this closely at open, and at $30/$35/$40 levels. For everyone who said it wasn\u2019t his tweet that made the stock spike from 28 ->39\n\nGME- Fell likely due to DFV\u2019s reveal of his stake in CHWY. (WOOF as well)\n\nSPR- BA agrees to buy SPR in $4.7B deal, SPR makes fuselages (the main body) for planes.\n\nNKE- Earnings last Thursday, cut full-year guidance and said it expects sales to drop 10% during current quarter. I\u2019m watching to see if we bounce at the open. Have a small position long but nothing huge in this.\n\nAMZN- We nearly hit that $200 level yesterday and the day before, will continue to watch this but will remove from list (or keep as a footnote) tomorrow.",

        "body": "Sometimes, I see the name on Reddit\u2026\n\n...sometimes, the ticker pops up on StockTwits\u2026\n\n\u2026sometimes, my friends and coworkers tell me about the gains they make from this ticker\u2026\n\nBut after 3 weekend articles by Motley Fool surrounding Palantir Technologies, and while I look for my next long-term buy and hold going into Monday, as well as the inevitable rise of artificial intelligence over the next few years, I figured it was time\u2026\n\n\u2026time for THE ULTIMATE DUE DILLIGENCE REPORT ON $PLTR - get your minds right and lock it in, because this is about to be some no-joke fucking research.\n\nFor a cute elevator-intro, Palantir Technologies ($PLTR ~ NYSE) was founded in 2003 by Peter Thiel, Alex Karp, and Stephen Cohen, with the mission to transform commercialized data analytics through the power of artificial intelligence.\n\nThe company develops software products for large institutions and government agencies that allows enormous data sets to be analyzed in just seconds.\n\nImagine blinking and you have a Pivot Table on Excel, except the data set is made up of a statewide census \ud83e\udd2f.\n\nLooking at some basic financial valuations on the fundamental side, Palantir market cap is listed as $45 billion, while reeling in $2.21 billion in revenue in 2023 for a net income of $341 million. EPS in 2023 capped at $0.18.For profitability, the company reported an 81% gross margin in 2023, plus a net margin of 10%.\n\n^I know, that is boring shit but it matters for a buy-and-hodl deal {;)}.\n\nAfter at all that mumbo-jumbo, the big names in Wall Street research think that $PLTR is a \u2018buy-and-hold\u2019 for years to come - like I said, Motley Fool, Yahoo Finance, even Zacks.com, although they gave them a Zacks rating of #3 for the short-term, which means that they\u2019re likely to move in the same direction as the market.\n\nNow, with the SPX falling off a cliff in the back half of the trading day on Friday 6/28, I don\u2019t know if a 2.69 5Y Beta stock is the best place to move position into, but July historically is a month for the Bulls - maybe $PLTR is MJ.\n\nMoving right along, $PLTR closed the trading day 6/28 at $25.33 a share, after a 6.25% rise on the week, compared to $SPX\u2019s stagnancy in the same period.\n\n$PLTR has been up for inclusion on the S&P 500 since 2023, but has yet to make the cut - yet it seems to have a lot of attention.\n\nPalantir Tech barely missed earnings projections by 1.59% just a short year ago, but since then has hit the market on all the analyst\u2019s projections - their YOY earnings for the last missed projection is set to release in 36 days - this will be detrimental to the future of their shareholders.\n\nLet\u2019s size-up against the comp.\n\nBeing in big-tech and big-data puts you up against some big names. IBM is running the sector for data and AI innovation and Snowflake is on a popularity rise bigger than Palantir.\n\nNonetheless, $PLTR, has established secure government contracts like those of their competitors, but the business is heavily reliant on those contracts as it stands.\n\nHowever, when your business model is centered around AI, I find it hard to believe that there won\u2019t be further innovation from the company that can propel itself past the Titans o\u2019 Tech, but the Bears have faked us out with the candlesticks before.\n\nThe Bear argument is centered around the dependency on government contracts and skepticism around the security of these lump-sums of data Palantir has at their disposal.\n\nBut the way a subreddit can be protected by AI Mod bots, I\u2019m taking AI in 4 games against any hacker lol.\n\nArtificial Intelligence is an immediate advantage in today's day and age, but more and more PTOs are taking advantage of the emerging flame - the team at Palantir will have their work cut out for them, but their advanced solutions and strong government relationships give me security for a long-term hold.\n\nThe Set Up\n\nPlain and simple - we\u2019re looking for a confirmed break over $27.45, buy, and forget my friends.\n\n$PLTR 1D w/ TradingView + StocksBuddy\n\nLet\u2019s see what we get out of this squad in Denver. Hope you guys enjoyed the read and found something valuable here. Per usual, NFA.\n\nSources\n\n1 2 3",

Yeah, I've read enough to know that you're either a pumper or basher, and I'm neither. But I have a few questions if any of you can manage to be kind enough to answer.\n\nAlmost every post here (and on other message boards) complain about dark pools, naked shorting, stock price manipulation and many other illegal behaviors done by the so-called \"Big Money\" to steal money from you \"little people\". It's happening daily, constantly...for years? Maybe decades? I don't know. But isn't that criminal, and if so, why hasn't the SEC done anything about it? Why isn't this top World News? If those few things are indeed happening, then I can see why the smart people will never buy stocks. Personally, I think of investing as something you do for a POSITIVE return. But based on many your posts, you are all just trying to break even all the time! Lol, you are in a persistent losing mode. That's not investing. That's freely donating money to strangers and then asking them to kick you in the balls while they take it. Do you consider yourself an investor or a gambler? Correct me if I'm wrong, but if a company is doing well, meaning...the CEO and Board are making money quarter after quarter, year after year, why is it okay with you that your ownership is devalued? As part owner, does it not make sense to you that you should share in the revenues?\n\nMy intention is not to insult anyone, but as one who is forced to see a little of stock market stuff whenever I am casually watching TV, I just wonder why you do it. The homeless guy pandering on the highway corner is probably making more money than the average trader. Just sayin'\n\nEDIT: 21 responses, downvoted (oh how shocking!) and I can see that only RaspingHaddock wants to discuss truths...why are the rest of you avoiding it? Does it make you angry or distressed or worried when people who notice things speak out? Is this stockmarket sub about discussing the stock market, or is it about hyping it? Is it about covering the truth by keeping everyone in the dark...distracted...entertained? I'd wager that most of you are trying to make money off those who are too stupid to know better...because that, my friends, makes the most sense considering how unwilling you are to get into the details that make up this so-called \"Fraud Market\". I am making the allegation...now it's incumbent upon you all who credit it so much to make your rebuttals. Explain why those three observations I made above are incorrect. If you can't do it, that means it's true.",

        "body": "In March 2018, a day after announcing sweeping tariffs on metals imported from America\u2019s allies and adversaries alike, President Donald J. Trump took to social media to share one of his central economic philosophies: \u201cTrade wars are good, and easy to win.\u201d\n\nAs president, Mr. Trump presided over the biggest increase in U.S. tariffs since the Great Depression, hitting China, Canada, the European Union, Mexico, India and other governments with stiff levies. They hit back, imposing tariffs on American soybeans, whiskey, orange juice and motorcycles. U.S. agricultural exports plummeted, prompting Mr. Trump to send $23 billion to farmers to help offset losses.\n\nNow, as he runs for president again, Mr. Trump is promising to ratchet up his trade war to a much greater degree. He has proposed \u201cuniversal baseline tariffs on most foreign products,\u201d including higher levies on certain countries that devalue their currency. In interviews, he has floated plans for a 10 percent tariff on most imports and a tariff of 60 percent or more on Chinese goods. He has also posited cutting the federal income tax and relying on tariffs for revenue instead.\n\nMr. Trump, who once proclaimed himself \u201cTariff Man,\u201d has long argued that tariffs would boost American factories, end the gap between what America imported and what it exported and increase American jobs.",

The hubs are meant to accelerate the growth of advanced industries in the United States, such as biomanufacturing, clean energy, artificial intelligence and personalized medicine.\n\nThe program reflects a federal effort to expand America\u2019s science and technology funding beyond Silicon Valley and a few coastal regions, an initiative that Biden administration officials say will help revitalize areas that have traditionally received less government investment. Proponents say the projects will help create \u201cgood-paying\u201d jobs and tap into underutilized pools of workers and resources across the country.\n\nThe $10 billion program was authorized by the CHIPS and Science Act, which Congress passed in 2022 to ramp up the domestic manufacturing of semiconductors and increase funding for scientific research. The idea of spreading technology funding beyond Silicon Valley helped the legislation win broader support from lawmakers representing parts of the country that were eager to benefit.",

Voting happens in two rounds, and candidates who reached certain thresholds will move on to the next round on Sunday.\n\nA two-year streak of high inflation has left low- and middle-income French families grappling to pay for basics like energy, gas and food, while wages, in some cases, have failed to keep pace. Polls show that worries over \u201cpurchasing power\u201d were a top concern of voters, alongside immigration and security.

That program, which has about eight million enrollees, ties borrowers\u2019 monthly payment amounts to their income and household size.\n\nTwo judges, one in Kansas and another in Missouri, last Monday issued separate preliminary injunctions, which are tied to lawsuits that were filed in the spring by two groups of Republican-led states that seek to upend the SAVE program.\n\nThe Kansas order suspended parts of the program that were not yet in place, including a big decrease in monthly payments for people with undergraduate debt \u2014 to 5 percent of their discretionary income from 10 percent \u2014 which was to take effect on July 1.

During the school year, she rushed home after class to feed the chickens on her family\u2019s corn and soybean farm. Neither of her parents went to college, but they encouraged their daughter when she decided to go to Carleton, a liberal arts school a two-hour drive from their farm in Minnesota.\n\nDespite being physically close to home, Ms. Lunz Trujillo was surprised by how foreign her upbringing seemed at the college. She was dismayed when she checked out the farm club and learned that its members wanted to brew kombucha, not milk cows. When an art history teacher asked students which famous paintings they\u2019d seen in person, Ms. Lunz Trujillo stayed quiet, because she had never been to an art museum. This sense of cultural alienation molded her research when she became a political scientist: What is rural identity? How does it shape a person\u2019s politics?\n\nThis year, Ms. Lunz Trujillo, now an assistant professor at the University of South Carolina, was reading a new, best-selling book that cited her research to explore those same questions.

        "title": "'If You Don't Have At Least $10 Million, Don't Retire Early' \u2014 Suze Orman Warns It'll Be The 'Biggest Mistake Of Your Lifetime'",
        "body": "Suze Orman, a bestselling author and renowned financial advisor, has voiced strong opposition to the Financial Independence, Retire Early (FIRE) movement. This group advocates for aggressive saving and investing to retire early and gain financial freedom. However, Orman believes the movement underestimates life\u2019s financial challenges and unpredictability.\n\nDon't Miss:\n\nOrman's extensive experience in financial planning informs her skepticism. She emphasizes that the pursuit of early retirement is precarious without substantial financial backing due to life\u2019s uncertainties and potential economic changes. \"I hate it. Really, I hate it,\" Orman said, addressing the FIRE movement\u2019s fundamental premise. She argues that the necessary funds for a sustainable post-retirement life are often underestimated, particularly when considering health emergencies, accidents, or market downturns.\n\nOrman challenges the FIRE advocates to consider the absence of a safety net provided by ongoing employment income. \"If you only have a few hundred thousand dollars, a million, or $2 million, I'm here to tell you ... if a catastrophe happens, what are you going to do? You are going to burn up alive,\" She asserted. Orman believes the sums many associate with financial sufficiency are grossly inadequate. She said, \"If you have 20, 30, 50, or 100 million dollars ... be like me, OK.\" She argues that her substantial wealth allows her to face the future without monetary stress, unlike those aiming for early retirement with significantly less.\n\nShe highlighted the potential pitfalls of underestimating retirement living costs, market fluctuations, reduced dividends, rising living expenses, and health care costs. \"Two million is nothing. It's nothing. It's pennies in today's world, to tell you the truth,\" Orman stated, emphasizing the rapid depletion of what might seem like an ample nest egg.\n\nTrending: Warren Buffett once said, \"If you don't find a way to make money while you sleep, you will work until you die.\" These high-yield real estate notes that pay 7.5% \u2013 9% make earning passive income easier than ever.\n\nThe issue with the FIRE movement, according to Suze Orman, is that people tend not to think about the costs they will face as they age and their loved ones age. Orman described a scenario where you might need to support a disabled family member. She explained that the ordinary cost of care is around $100,000 per year, but full-time care can cost up to $250,000. She elaborated, \"This means you'll need $350,000 per year after taxes to cover your costs, which is $500,000 per year before taxes, which at a five percent withdrawal rate means that you'd need a portfolio of $10 million.\"\n\nStory continues\n\nOrman summed it up by saying, \"If you don't have at least $5 million or $10 million, don't retire early.\"\n\nShe also pointed out broader economic trends, such as the rise of artificial intelligence and automation, which could lead to significant unemployment and strain on Social Security and tax systems. \"Do not be surprised if by the year 2030, there is a 25% unemployment rate,\" she warned, suggesting that these developments could further challenge the sustainability of early retirement.\n\nWhile some may think Orman is out of touch and she receives tons of backlash for these bold comments and criticisms of FIRE, she may not be so far off. Orman raises concerns about the underestimated costs of caring for disabled family members. Experts echo her apprehensions.

        "title": "Ex-Billionaire Gets 7 1/2-Year Sentence for Defrauding Investors Goldman, Google",
        "body": "(Bloomberg) -- A former jet-setting Chicago billionaire was sentenced to seven and a half years in prison for a $1 billion fraud at an advertising startup that included investors such as Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Google parent Alphabet Inc. and Illinois Governor JB Pritzker\u2019s venture capital firm.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg\n\nRishi Shah, 38, the co-founder of Outcome Health, which provided ads on TVs in doctors\u2019 offices, was convicted of more than a dozen fraud and money laundering charges by a federal jury last year. He and two other Outcome executives were sentenced last week in Chicago by US District Judge Thomas Durkin, the US Attorney\u2019s Office said in a statement Monday.\n\nProsecutors had sought a 15-year sentence, describing Shah as the \u201cdriving force behind a dizzying array of lies to clients, lenders, investors and an audit firm.\u201d He and the other executives were accused of lying to pharmaceutical company clients and taking money for ads that were never placed, and then misrepresenting the health of the company to investors.\n\nBefore the fraud was revealed in a 2017 Wall Street Journal article, Shah was a budding star in Democratic circles. Shah got the idea for Outcome \u2014 then known as Context Media Health \u2014 in 2006 while he was a student at Northwestern University just north of Chicago, and the company\u2019s rapid rise over the next decade boosted his public profile. Then-Mayor Rahm Emanuel declared at a company press conference, \u201cas Outcome goes, so goes Chicago.\u201d\n\nOversold Ads\n\nBut Outcome\u2019s claims of exponential revenue growth were driven by fraud, as the company sold more ads than it could broadcast and lied to clients like pharmaceutical giant Novo Nordisk A/S about the size of its network of TVs in doctors\u2019 offices, according to prosecutors and securities regulators.\n\nThe company\u2019s surge in cash from ad sales and financings allowed Shah to extract hundreds of millions of dollars from Outcome to live a lavish lifestyle, with weekend trips on private yachts and jets as well as a $10 million home, the government said. After raising more money from lenders and investors based on bogus financial statements in 2016, Shah\u2019s net worth was reported at more than $4 billion, prosecutors said.\n\n\u201cOutcome\u2019s former executives deceived their clients, their auditor, their lenders, and their investors for years,\u201d Principal Deputy Assistant Attorney General Nicole M. Argentieri, head of the Justice Department\u2019s Criminal Division, said in the statement. \u201cTheir sentences should serve as yet another reminder that \u2018faking it until you make it\u2019 is not an acceptable practice for any business.\u201d\n\nStory continues\n\nShah told the judge last week in a prepared statement that he was \u201cashamed and embarrassed\u201d by his failure to properly manage the company\u2019s aggressive push for growth, which led to \u201ca number of fatal mistakes\u201d that included not tracking the delivery of ads paid for by clients.\n\n\u201cThe culture I created permissioned people on my team to think it was okay to create false data in response to client questions,\u201d he said in the statement, which was filed with the court.\n\nShah was convicted in April 2023 along with Outcome President and co-founder Shradha Agarwal and Chief Financial Officer Brad Purdy. Prosecutors had sought 10-year sentences for Agarwal, 38, and Purdy, 35. But Durkin sentenced Agarwal to three years in a half-way house and Purdy got two years and three months in prison.\n\nA group of funds, including those owned by Goldman, Alphabet and Pritzker, were among the investors that sued Outcome in 2017, claiming fraud tied to a $487.5 million fundraising that year that led to a $225 million dividend pocketed by Shah and Agarwal.\n\nIn addition, the US Securities and Exchange Commission sued Shah, Agarwal, Purdy and former chief growth officer Ashik Desai, claiming they used false financial statements to raise cash. Desai and two other Outcome employees pleaded guilty to charges before the criminal trial against the company\u2019s top executives.\n\nThe criminal case is US v. Shah, 19-cr-00864, US District Court, Northern District of Illinois (Chicago).\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek\n\n\u00a92024 Bloomberg L.P.",

The shares retraced some gains and recently traded at 23 cents.\n\nEach share pays out $1 (in USDC, a stablecoin, or cryptocurrency pegged to the U.S. dollar) if the prediction comes true, and zero if not.\n\nOfficially, President Joe Biden is still the presumptive Democratic nominee. But many supporters are calling on him to step aside, and some of them want Harris to step up following her boss's doddering performance at last week's debate with former commander-in-chief and almost-certain Republican standard-bearer Donald J. Trump.\n\n\"We should do everything we can to bolster her, whether it\u2019s in second place or the top of the ticket,\" Rep. James Clyburn, D-S.C, said on television Tuesday.\n\nA Newsweek op-ed by former Congressman Tim Ryan, the first presidential candidate to endorse Biden in 2020, was more blunt: \"Kamala Harris Should Be the Democratic Nominee for President in 2024.\" An analysis by The Wall Street Journal called Harris \"Biden\u2019s Likeliest Replacement.\"\n\nThe trend was similar Tuesday on PredictIt, a more traditional prediction market platform where bets are settled in dollars rather than crypto. \"Yes\" shares for Harris there more than doubled to 35 cents. PredictIt's volume on the question of who will win the Democratic nomination totals $31 million, dwarfed by Polymarket at $75 million.\n\nUnder a settlement with the Commodity Futures Trading Commission, Polymarket is barred from doing business in the U.S., whereas PredictIt is allowed to operate in the country under a regulatory exemption.\n\nTuesday was Polymarket's fifth-largest volume day in its four-year history, with $5.7 million in trading, according to Dune Analytics data. June was the first month Polymarket saw more than $100 million in volume.\n\nIts largest contract by far, with $211 million in bets, asks who will win the U.S. presidency in November. Trump remains the favorite, with a 66% chance of victory.\n\nMeanwhile, KAMA, a meme coin named after the vice president, rallied Tuesday, more than doubling in price over 24 hours to $0.007815.\n\nStory continues\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",

        "body": "Bill Gates Was The 'World's Richest Man' For A Record 18 Years. His Secret To Success? 'Saving Like A Pessimist, Investing Like An Optimist'\n\nBill Gates, co-founder of Microsoft and one of the most influential figures in the tech industry, is renowned for his business acumen and unique approach to financial management. After dropping out of college at 19, Gates cofounded Microsoft with Paul Allen, transforming it from a small startup into a global tech giant.\n\nDon't Miss:\n\nGates dominated the Forbes list of the world\u2019s wealthiest individuals from 1995 to 2017, holding the top spot for 18 out of 23 years. This unprecedented run showcases his ability to accumulate wealth and maintain and grow it over an extended period despite market fluctuations and economic challenges.\n\nAt the heart of Gates\u2019 financial philosophy lies a seemingly contradictory lesson which author and psychologist Morgan Housel observed in a 2021 CNBC article: \"Save like a pessimist, invest like an optimist.\" This maxim encapsulates his balanced approach to money management, a cornerstone of his success.\n\nThe Pessimist\u2019s Safety Net\n\nGates\u2019 pessimistic approach to saving is exemplified by a practice he implemented in Microsoft\u2019s early days. He insisted on always having enough cash in the bank to keep the company running for 12 months, even if revenue dropped to zero. This conservative strategy ensured Microsoft\u2019s survival during potential downturns and provided a solid foundation for growth.\n\nIn an interview with Charlie Rose, Gates reportedly expressed his concerns and the reasons for maintaining a consistent cash reserve. He stated, \"I was always worried because people who worked for me were older than me and had kids, and I always thought, \u2018What if we don\u2019t get paid? Will I be able to meet the payroll?\u2019\"\n\nTrending: Want to invest in homes? $10 is enough on this platform that lets you cash out whenever you want.\n\nThe Optimist\u2019s Growth Mindset\n\nWhile maintaining a pessimistic approach to saving, Gates advocated for optimism in investments. He believed in the long-term potential of markets and technology, making bold bets that ultimately paid off. This optimistic outlook drove Microsoft\u2019s innovation and expansion, contributing significantly to its dominant position in the tech industry.\n\nStory continues\n\nHousel noted Gates\u2019 approach is rooted in a deep understanding of market dynamics. He believes that long-term progress is the general trend while short-term setbacks are inevitable. By preparing for immediate challenges (the pessimist\u2019s view) while remaining confident in future growth (the optimist\u2019s perspective), Gates created a stellar strategy for sustained success.\n\nAnyone can apply this mindset to personal financial management:\n\nBuild an emergency fund (save like a pessimist): Aim to have 3-6 months of living expenses saved, preparing for unexpected challenges. Invest for the long term (invest like an optimist): Despite market fluctuations, maintain faith in the long-term growth potential of diversified investments. Balance risk and security: While taking calculated risks for growth, ensure a safety net to weather short-term storms. Continuous learning: Stay informed about financial markets and emerging opportunities, adapting your strategy as needed. Plan for the worst, hope for the best: Create contingency plans while working towards ambitious financial goals.\n\nBill Gates\u2019 financial philosophy offers a valuable lesson in balancing caution and ambition. This balanced strategy, proven successful by one of the world\u2019s most prominent business leaders, provides a road map for achieving lasting financial stability and growth.\n\nRead Next:\n\n\"ACTIVE INVESTORS' SECRET WEAPON\" Supercharge Your Stock Market Game with the #1 \"news & everything else\" trading tool: Benzinga Pro - Click here to start Your 14-Day Trial Now!\n\nGet the latest stock analysis from Benzinga?\n\nThis article Bill Gates Was The 'World's Richest Man' For A Record 18 Years.

He also owns a $21 billion stake in waste-management company Republic Services Inc. through Cascade.\n\nGates, 68, has been slowly reducing his fortune through philanthropy. Along with his ex-wife Melinda French Gates and his friend Warren Buffett, Gates has funneled billions of dollars of his personal money to build up the $75 billion Gates Foundation, one of the biggest charitable organizations in the world.\n\nSince they started the foundation more than two decades ago, Gates and his former wife have given almost $60 billion from their personal fortunes. French Gates recently stepped down as co-chair of the foundation and received $12.5 billion to use for her own charitable purposes.\n\nIn 2010, Gates, French Gates and Buffett also founded the Giving Pledge, an organization that encourages the world\u2019s richest people to give away the majority of their fortunes in their lifetimes or their wills. Ballmer, 68, who has not signed the Giving Pledge, has his own philanthropic work but nowhere on the scale of Gates.\n\nGates founded Microsoft with his friend Paul Allen in 1975 and led it until 2000, when Ballmer \u2014 one of the company\u2019s earliest employees \u2014 replaced him as CEO.

        "title": "2 Stocks Down 74% and 57.5% to Buy Right Now",
        "body": "In the stock market, it's often true that winners tend to keep winning. Powerful sales and earnings momentum typically translates into strong returns for shareholders.\n\nOn the other hand, it's also possible to score big wins by backing high-quality businesses that are being underestimated due to near-term headwinds that can be overcome with time.\n\nWith that in mind, read on to see why two Motley Fool contributors think that investing in these two industry-leading companies would be a smart move while they still trade at massive discounts.\n\nA true bargain for risk-tolerant investors\n\nJennifer Saibil: The stock of Carnival (NYSE: CCL) doubled last year and is on the rise this year, but believe it or not, it's still 74% below its previous high.That might be surprising because its business has rebounded and is surpassing pre-pandemic levels. Carnival is reporting record revenue, high demand, and improving profitability.\n\nIn the 2024 fiscal second quarter (ended May 31), revenue was a record $5.8 billion. Operating income was $560 million, up almost 400% from last year, and it posted a net profit of $92 million, or $0.07 per share.\n\nDemand continues to be elevated, and there were record customer deposits and booking levels again. Trends of a longer booked-out curve at higher pricing continued, and the total booked position for the rest of 2024 is its best ever, while there are record bookings for 2025.\n\nSo what's the catch? There are still quite a few metrics falling short of pre-pandemic performance, and that's putting off investors.\n\nNet income was positive in the quarter, but that's still inconsistent. More pressing, though, is the debt. Carnival is paying off the massive debt it took on to stay running when it had no revenue, but it's still at $29 billion.\n\nIt has $5.7 billion of maturities over the next three years, and it needs to bring in enough cash to pay those off. It had $2 billion in cash from operations in the second quarter and $1.3 billion in free cash flow, and if it can keep up those kinds of numbers, it should be OK.\n\nBut it has to keep it up for a long time to be able to pay off the total extra debt and still have enough cash to run its business. That comes with a good dose of risk for shareholders right now.\n\nThat's why the market is still pricing it at a low valuation of just 1 time trailing 12-month sales. At this price, and with its excellent performance and potential, it looks like a real bargain for risk-tolerant investors.\n\nBuy Nike stock on its recent pullback\n\nKeith Noonan: Even before the publication of Nike's (NYSE: NKE) most recent earnings report, the footwear and apparel leader's stock had started 2024 on the wrong foot.\n\nStory continues\n\nInflation and other economic factors have made shoppers more price sensitive, and softer demand in key international markets was also weighing on the stock. Signs that the business could take longer than previously expected to return to delivering solid growth have only strengthened bearish sentiment.\n\nNike stock plummeted roughly 20% in the day of trading after the release of its earnings report for the fourth quarter of its last fiscal year, which ended May 31. The business actually posted a significant earnings beat in the quarter, with adjusted per-share earnings of $1.01 coming in far better than the average analyst estimate's call for a per-share profit of $0.84 in the quarter.\n\nOn the other hand, revenue of $12.61 billion came up roughly $250 million short of the average target on Wall Street.\n\nRevenue fell 2% year over year on a currency adjusted basis in the period. Adding to bearish pressures for the stock, management's guidance for a roughly 10% sales decline in the first quarter came in significantly worse than Wall Street's forecast. Expectations that the business will continue to face macroeconomic pressures in the U.S. and relatively soft demand in China point to an uninspiring outlook for the remainder of the year.\n\nShares are now down roughly 31% year to date and 57.5% from their lifetime high. While it's clear that the business is facing some headwinds, the recent pullback likely presents a worthwhile buying opportunity.\n\nOver the last five years, Nike's share price has been below its current level only briefly in 2020, a period marked by a massive marketwide sell-off due to the pandemic. With the stock valued at roughly 20 times trailing-12-month profits, Nike hasn't traded at a lower trailing earnings multiple at any point in the last half-decade.\n\nThe dramatic sell-off has also pushed the company's dividend yield up to 1.9%, its highest ever. The weaker outlook suggests that dividend growth could proceed at a slower pace in the near term, but Nike has still raised its dividend roughly 68% over the last five years and 208% over the last decade.\n\nNike is in turnaround mode and will likely face sales pressures this year, but the company still has powerful infrastructure and distribution advantages and one of the strongest brands in the world. For investors seeking dividend-growth stocks and attractively valued comeback plays, shares look like a smart buy right now.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Carnival Corp. right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Carnival Corp., consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Carnival Corp. wasn\u2019t one of them. The 10 stocks that made the cut could produce monster returns in the coming years.\n\nConsider when Nvidia made this list on April 15, 2005... if you invested $1,000 at the time of our recommendation, you\u2019d have $761,658!*\n\nStock Advisor provides investors with an easy-to-follow blueprint for success, including guidance on building a portfolio, regular updates from analysts, and two new stock picks each month.

        "title": "Cathie Wood Says Software Is the Next Big AI Opportunity -- 2 Supercharged Stocks You'll Regret Not Buying if She's Right",
        "body": "Last year, Ark Investment Management CEO Cathie Wood said software companies will be the next big opportunity in artificial intelligence (AI), predicting they will eventually generate $8 in revenue for every $1 spent on chips from leading suppliers like Nvidia.\n\nArk operates several funds (both private and exchange-traded) that reflect that stance. Using the Ark Venture Fund, Wood has piled into private AI software companies like OpenAI, Anthropic, and Elon Musk's xAI. Plus, Tesla is the largest holding in the flagship Ark Innovation ETF, which Wood says is the largest AI opportunity in the world thanks to its autonomous self-driving software.\n\nIf Wood is right about AI software, there could be a long list of winners in the coming years. Here's why CrowdStrike (NASDAQ: CRWD) and Meta Platforms (NASDAQ: META) might be two of the biggest.\n\n1. CrowdStrike: A leader in AI-powered cybersecurity\n\nCrowdStrike is one of the world's best cybersecurity companies. In fact, its stock only needs to rise another 14% to eclipse the $104 billion valuation of the current industry leader, Palo Alto Networks. CrowdStrike's success stems from its unique lightweight security architecture and its reliance on AI to autonomously thwart attacks.\n\nCrowdStrike's AI models make over 180 million indicator-of-attack decisions every second -- in other words, they are constantly analyzing the motive and intent of attackers to determine the type of threat they pose. Those models are trained on more than 2 trillion security events each day, and that number climbs as more customers join CrowdStrike, which extends the company's AI advantage over its competitors.\n\nAll of that happens in the cloud. By using CrowdStrike, companies don't have to install bulky programs on every single device in their organization. Instead, they install a lightweight sensor that is connected to the cloud, which occupies minimal processing power compared to traditional cybersecurity software.\n\nCrowdStrike has taken a platform approach to cybersecurity since the day it was founded, which is in contrast to industry norms where different providers specialize in specific segments like cloud security, identity protection, and endpoint security. CrowdStrike covers all bases through its 28 modules, and while not every business needs the entire suite, 65% of customers were using five or more modules as of the recent fiscal 2025 first quarter (ended April 30).\n\nAccording to a CrowdStrike-sponsored study by International Data Corporation, businesses can save $6 for every $1 they invest in consolidating their cybersecurity needs onto the one platform. Therefore, not only do they get best-in-class protection, but switching to CrowdStrike is a no-brainer financially.\n\nStory continues\n\nCrowdStrike ended Q1 with a record $3.6 billion in annual recurring revenue, but management believes that figure will surge 177% to $10 billion within the next five to seven years. That estimate might even be conservative considering how quickly AI is advancing, which will not only improve CrowdStrike's protective capabilities, but will create new threats that will drive more cybersecurity spending in the corporate sector.\n\n2. Meta Platforms: A social media giant turned AI developer\n\nMeta Platforms is home to leading social networks like Facebook, Instagram, and WhatsApp, which serve 3.2 billion people every day. The company is already using AI to curate the content feeds for each user on Facebook and Instagram to ensure they are seeing posts that are most relevant to them. Last year, this drove an increase in engagement across both platforms, which provided Meta with more opportunities to generate advertising revenue.\n\nBut the company might have an even greater AI opportunity in its large language model (LLM) called Llama. It's the world's largest open-source model, so developers can use it for free to build their own AI applications, which allows Meta to crowdsource its testing to make improvements more quickly. That's important because Llama is the key to creating new AI features for Meta's existing platforms.\n\nFor example, the company launched a chatbot called Meta AI last year that users can access through Facebook, Instagram, Messenger, and WhatsApp. It can answer complex questions and generate images like most chatbots, but it can also be added to group chats to make restaurant and travel recommendations, or even offer gift ideas. Meta AI is currently powered by Llama 3, but the company is already training its next-generation model, which should offer even better capabilities.\n\nEventually, every business using Meta's apps could have its own personalized Meta AI-style chatbot that can handle incoming customer queries, and potentially even process sales. That should create new opportunities for Meta to generate revenue.\n\nHere's the best part about Meta stock: It's cheap. Based on the company's $17.41 in trailing-12-month earnings per share, it trades at a price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio of 28.9. That's a 9.4% discount to the 31.9 P/E ratio of the Nasdaq-100 index.\n\nIn 2025, Wall Street thinks Meta will generate $21.59 in earnings, which places its forward P/E ratio at just 23.3. That implies Meta stock will have to rise 36.9% by the end of next year just to trade in line with the broader tech sector.\n\nIf Cathie Wood is right about AI software, Meta stock might be an even bigger bargain today than the above numbers suggest, because there could be entirely new AI monetization opportunities to come as this story unfolds.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in CrowdStrike right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in CrowdStrike, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and CrowdStrike wasn\u2019t one of them.

        "title": "3 Stocks That Could Create Lasting Generational Wealth",
        "body": "If you're trying to build generational wealth, you shouldn't think about getting rich quick. It's all about creating a portfolio of companies that are built to last. On that score, you should keep old favorite Coca-Cola (NYSE: KO) and relatively young Chipotle Mexican Grill (NYSE: CMG) on your wish list, while Hormel Foods (NYSE: HRL) might be worth adding to your portfolio right now. Here's a quick look at each stock.\n\n1. Coca-Cola is a behemoth\n\nWith a market cap of roughly $270 billion, Coca-Cola is one of the largest consumer staples companies on the planet. Don't underestimate the benefit this has for the company and for investors. For starters, Coca-Cola's business is underpinned by a stable of iconic brands, notably including namesake Coke. Moreover, the company has a global distribution network and the financial firepower to support its brands with advertising. And it's big enough to buy its way into new products and categories over time.\n\nThe consumer staples sector is one in which retailers and end consumers are both seen as customers for companies like Coca-Cola. The advantages Coca-Cola generates from its size work to entice consumers into stores and, thus, get stores to buy Coca-Cola products for sale. Small competitors that can't match up often don't get the same shelf space, effectively cementing Coca-Cola's already dominant position. But if the smaller competitors are on to something new, well, they and their hot new product might just end up a part of Coca-Cola. These are the many reasons Coca-Cola is a Dividend King, with over 60 years of annual dividend increases behind it. The dividend yield is roughly 3% today, well above the 1.3% on offer from the S&P 500 Index.\n\n2. Chipotle Mexican Grill is established, but still growing\n\nCompared to a company like McDonald's, Chipotle Mexican Grill is still just a kid. But it has clearly established itself as a dominant force in the restaurant sector. In fact, the company's fresh made assembly line format has been copied many times over, including by recent market darling Cava. Chipotle has done so well for so long that its stock rose to herculean heights, leading it to a huge 50:1 stock split to get the price back down to the level where mere mortals could afford to buy a share. The best news? Despite the already impressive growth in Chipotle's business, it is still showing impressive signs of strength.\n\nFor example, in the first quarter of 2024 the company's overall sales rose a huge 14% year over year to $2.7 billion. For reference, the first-quarter top line at McDonald's was nearly $6.2 billion, so there's still plenty of room for growth ahead at Chipotle. But the really interesting number was Chipotle's same-store sales, which came in at 7%. Half of that figure would be considered good, noting that McDonald's managed only 1.9% in the quarter. What this tells you is that Chipotle is still benefiting from strong demand, which should allow it to keep opening new restaurants for the foreseeable future. Chipotle is focused on investing for growth, so it doesn't pay a dividend. But if you don't mind that fact, it looks like the kind of stock that you could hand on to the next generation for safe keeping. That said, the stock is always expensive, so waiting for a market downturn might lead to a better entry point.\n\nStory continues\n\n3. Hormel's dividend yield is historically high\n\nLike Coca-Cola, Hormel Foods is a Dividend King. It has increased its dividend annually for 58 consecutive years. It isn't nearly as large as Coca-Cola, but it does have a stable of industry leading brands, like Spam and Planters, among many others. It is also highly innovative, bringing out \"new\" and \"improved\" products with great regularity. The words \"new\" and \"improved\" have particular power with consumers, which is one of the reasons retailers like to work with Hormel. So why is the stock's yield near its highest levels of all time at 3.7%?\n\nThe quick answer is a perfect storm. Hormel wasn't able to pass price increases on to consumers as well as its peers, margins got squeezed by inflation, avian flu has been pretty bad lately, sales in China have been slow to recover from COVID lockdowns, and the company bought the Planters brand right as the nut category of the snack sector was slowing down. Any one of these problems alone wouldn't be too big a deal. All five at the same time has investors worried that Hormel's best days are in the past. Given the company's long and successful history, though, it seems reasonable to give the management the benefit of the doubt. And you'll be paid well to wait for Hormel to muddle through to better days.\n\nOne to buy, one to consider, and one to watch\n\nGiven the negative sentiment around Hormel today, it looks like an attractive long-term buying opportunity. Coca-Cola isn't exactly cheap, but it isn't exactly expensive, either. If you want to create a reliable income stream, you might want to take a closer look. Chipotle has the best growth prospects of the three, but investors are pricing in a lot of good news. If there's a bear market and investors throw the baby out with the bathwater, as is normally the case, you might want to jump aboard.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Coca-Cola right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Coca-Cola, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Coca-Cola wasn\u2019t one of them.

        "body": "As retirement approaches, many couples face crucial decisions regarding their living arrangements. One such couple recently sought advice from financial expert Suze Orman on whether to buy a home or rent a luxury senior apartment.\n\nThe husband and wife are financially secure, with a combined monthly income of over $9,000 from pensions and Social Security, savings of around $100,000, and $850,000 in an IRA, annuity, and Roth account.\n\nDon't Miss:\n\nThe average American couple has saved this much money for retirement \u2014 How do you compare ?\n\nWarren Buffett once said, \"If you don't find a way to make money while you sleep, you will work until you die.\" These high-yield real estate notes that pay 7.5% \u2013 9% make earning passive income easier than ever.\n\nOrman first highlighted the couple's solid financial standing, noting they have no debt and can sell their current home for $450,000 to $500,000 without incurring capital gains tax. This financial freedom means buying or renting isn't strictly about money but lifestyle preferences and practical considerations.\n\nShe pointed out the physical demands of home maintenance as a significant factor for retirees. \"They are in their seventies and are not sure if they are up to the challenge of daily housekeeping maintenance at their age,\" she said. KT KT echoed these concerns, highlighting that such tasks become increasingly burdensome as people age.\n\n\"After 70, you start to feel it,\" KT remarked, highlighting the importance of considering one's physical capabilities when deciding on living arrangements.\n\nThe couple is torn between the husband's preference for buying a home and the wife's inclination toward a luxury senior community apartment. The wife enjoys socializing and traveling, benefiting from the amenities and services such communities provide.\n\nSuze Orman provided a compelling argument for the wife's choice, focusing on the benefits of senior community living. \"You have a community around you,\" she said, recounting the positive experiences of both her mother and KT's mother in similar settings. These communities offer various activities and social opportunities, such as happy hours, educational classes, movies, swimming, and golf.\n\nTrending: Elon Musk and Jeff Bezos are bullish on one city that could dethrone New York and become the new financial capital of the US. Investing in its booming real estate market has never been more accessible.\n\nOrman stressed the importance of moving to a senior community while both partners are healthy. \"In most cases, you can't move in if one of you is seriously ill,\" she advised, urging the couple to make the transition sooner rather than later. She also noted women\u2019s higher life expectancy, which could leave the wife managing a house alone if her husband passes away first.\n\nStory continues\n\nOrman humorously warned, \"Your husband probably shouldn't hear this part of the answer,\" referring to the predominantly female demographics of senior communities and the social perks for the few men who live there.\n\nFinancial experts often advise evaluating the costs and benefits of both options for seniors with existing homes like this couple. Selling a house can free up equity that can be used to fund other retirement needs or investments while renting can simplify life by eliminating the need for ongoing maintenance and large, unexpected expenses.\n\nWhile buying a home can offer stability, and potential equity growth, renting may provide a more carefree lifestyle, especially valuable in the later stages of life.\n\nFinancially, the couple can afford either option. Orman, however, leaned toward the wife's preference for a senior community, emphasizing its convenience and reduced responsibilities. She advised the husband to \"listen to your wife here because, in the long run, you're gonna be so happy that you did.\"\n\nIf you\u2019re exploring options for your retirement living arrangements, remember that the right choice depends on your individual needs and priorities. Consider factors like home maintenance, social engagement, and desired lifestyle when making this important decision. Consulting with a financial advisor can provide valuable guidance and ensure you make the best choice for your golden years.\n\nRead Next:\n\n\"ACTIVE INVESTORS' SECRET WEAPON\" Supercharge Your Stock Market Game with the #1 \"news & everything else\" trading tool: Benzinga Pro - Click here to start Your 14-Day Trial Now!\n\nGet the latest stock analysis from Benzinga?\n\nThis article Retired Couple Making Over $9000 A Month With $1 Million Savings Can't Agree Whether To Buy Or Rent \u2014 Suze Orman Says 'Listen To Your Wife' originally appeared on Benzinga.com\n\n\u00a9 2024 Benzinga.com.

        "title": "Here's Why You May Want to Plan to Claim Social Security at 62 -- Despite the Smaller Monthly Check",
        "body": "It's a good idea to try to figure out when you'll claim Social Security well ahead of retirement. That way, you can get an estimate of your monthly benefit based on your filing age. And from there, you can do some number crunching to make sure you're making a smart decision.\n\nNow there's a pretty wide range of Social Security filing ages you can choose from, the earliest of which is 62. There's technically no latest or final filing age, though you should know that there's nothing to be gained financially by delaying Social Security past the age of 70.\n\nImage source: Getty Images.\n\nBut often, you'll hear that it's smart to wait until at least your full retirement age (FRA) to claim Social Security. That age is 66, 67, or somewhere in between, depending on when you were born.\n\nFull retirement age is when you get your complete monthly Social Security benefit based on your individual wage history. Taking benefits at 62 could slash them by up to 30%, which is a financial hit you may not want.\n\nBut while claiming Social Security at 62 may not be your optimal choice, you may want to plan on doing so anyway. Here's why.\n\nIt's a good backup plan\n\nIt's not a given that you'll need to claim Social Security as soon as you retire. If you have a lot of savings, you may be able to take withdrawals from your 401(k) or IRA and hold off on Social Security to score a higher benefit.\n\nBut often, people retire and sign up for Social Security right away. That's something you may not be planning to do until full retirement age arrives. But sometimes plans can go awry.\n\nIt's not uncommon to be forced into an earlier retirement than what's desired for a variety of reasons. These could run the gamut from health issues to being ousted from a job due to age (something that's absolutely illegal but also hard to prove in many cases).\n\nIf you end up out of work at age 62, you may have no choice but to claim Social Security right away to keep up with your expenses. And that's why it may be a good idea to just plan on filing for benefits at 62 in the course of running your retirement numbers. That way, you're accounting for the lowest monthly benefit you might get. If you're able to file at any point beyond age 62, you stand to collect more money, which only improves your numbers.\n\nIt pays to play it safe\n\nTo be clear, planning for a smaller Social Security benefit and actually collecting one are two different things. If, come age 62, you're still working and in good health, then it could absolutely pay to delay your filing until full retirement age or beyond (there's an 8% boost coming your way for each year you hold off on filing past that point, up until your 70th birthday).\n\nStory continues\n\nRather, the takeaway here is that you should simply plan on filing for Social Security at 62 in case you end up being forced to do so. If you're able to make your retirement expenses work on a smaller monthly benefit, you'll be that much happier if your actual benefit ends up being far more substantial.\n\nThe $ 22,924 Social Security bonus most retirees completely overlook\n\nIf you're like most Americans, you're a few years (or more) behind on your retirement savings. But a handful of little-known \"Social Security secrets\" could help ensure a boost in your retirement income. For example: one easy trick could pay you as much as $22,924 more... each year! Once you learn how to maximize your Social Security benefits, we think you could retire confidently with the peace of mind we're all after.

        "body": "The first half of 2024 is officially in the books, and the bulls remain in firm control on Wall Street. Since this year began, the iconic Dow Jones Industrial Average, benchmark S&P 500, and widely followed Nasdaq Composite have all leaped to fresh, all-time highs.\n\nWhile specific trends have been singled out as clear-cut catalysts for this bull market rally, including the rise of artificial intelligence (AI) and companies enacting stock splits, the prevailing theme has been investors' willingness to gravitate to growth stocks. This is a trend not lost by Wall Street's smartest (and richest) investors.\n\nImage source: Getty Images.\n\nNo later than 45 days following the end to a quarter, institutional investors with at least $100 million in assets under management (AUM) are required to file Form 13F with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). A 13F allows investors an over-the-shoulder look at what Wall Street's billionaires have been buying and selling.\n\nThe latest round of 13Fs show that billionaire money managers were especially active in high-growth stocks during the March-ended quarter. More specifically, they were busy dumping shares of Wall Street's hottest megacap growth stock and absolutely piling into two other hypergrowth companies.\n\nC'est la vie, Nvidia!\n\nThere's probably not a hotter stock on Wall Street right now than AI kingpin Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA). At its peak two weeks ago, Nvidia briefly surpassed Microsoft and Apple to gain the title of \"most-valuable public company.\" Since the start of 2023, Nvidia's market cap surged by as much as $3 trillion, which necessitated a 10-for-1 stock split last month.\n\nThe catalyst behind this monumental run in Nvidia's stock is its market-leading AI hardware. The company's AI-driven graphics processing units (GPUs) rapidly became the standard in high-compute data centers. With Nvidia set to roll out its next-generation AI-GPU architecture (Blackwell) later this year, it should have no trouble sustaining its compute advantage.\n\nDespite this seemingly flawless ramp in its operations, eight prominent billionaire investors dumped shares of this market leader during the first quarter, including (total shares sold in parenthesis):\n\nPhilippe Laffont of Coatue Management (2,937,060 shares).\n\nKen Griffin of Citadel Advisors (2,462,716 shares).\n\nIsrael Englander of Millennium Management (720,004 shares).\n\nStanley Druckenmiller of Duquesne Family Office (441,551 shares).\n\nJohn Overdeck and David Siegel of Two Sigma Investments (420,801 shares).\n\nDavid Tepper of Appaloosa (348,000 shares).\n\nSteven Cohen of Point72 Asset Management (304,505 shares).\n\nStory continues\n\nIt's certainly plausible that these eight billionaires were simply locking in gains after a monster run higher by Nvidia. But it's also possible that headwinds are beginning to surface and becoming recognized by Wall Street's wisest billionaire money managers.\n\nFor example, Nvidia is set to face its first real bout of competition. Intel should begin shipping its Gaudi 3 AI-accelerator chip on a broad scale sometime this quarter, while Advanced Micro Devices has continued to ramp up production of its MI300X AI-GPU. With enterprise demand for AI-GPUs overwhelming supply, it shouldn't be difficult for Intel and AMD to grab market share from Nvidia.\n\nWhat's more, Nvidia is facing competition from within. Its four top customers, which account for approximately 40% of its net sales, are developing AI-GPUs of their own. While these chips aren't going to outperform Nvidia's on a compute basis, the development of these chips represents a clear sign that its leading customers are aiming to lessen their reliance on the AI kingpin.\n\nPerhaps the biggest warning for Nvidia is that every game-changing innovation and technology for 30 years has navigated its way through an early-stage bubble. This is to say that investors have consistently overestimated the adoption of next-big-thing innovations for three decades. Artificial intelligence is unlikely to break this trend.\n\nImage source: Getty Images.\n\nMore than a half-dozen billionaires are making waves in Sea\n\nAlthough the stock market is historically pricey, Wall Street's billionaire investors did mash the buy button for a couple of hypergrowth stocks, including Singapore-based Sea Limited (NYSE: SE). Q1 saw eight billionaire asset managers buy shares (total shares purchased in parenthesis):\n\nSteven Cohen of Point72 Asset Management (1,527,446 shares).\n\nPhilippe Laffont of Coatue Management (678,308 shares).\n\nChase Coleman of Tiger Global Management (675,900 shares).\n\nJohn Overdeck and David Siegel of Two Sigma Investments (338,720 shares).\n\nLeon Cooperman of Omega Advisors (240,000 shares).\n\nKen Griffin of Citadel Advisors (190,432 shares).\n\nJeff Yass of Susquehanna International (17,902 shares).\n\nWhat makes Sea such an appealing investment to billionaires is that it has three unique, fast-growing operating segments.\n\nThe division that's historically been the most profitable is its digital-entertainment operations, known as \"Garena.\" As you can imagine, mobile gaming was exceptionally popular during the COVID-19 pandemic. Though the percentage of paying users, relative to quarterly active users, has dipped from its peak during the height of the pandemic, the 8.2% of users who were paying customers during Q1 is many multiples higher than the pay-to-play average for the mobile-gaming industry.\n\nThe second rapidly growing operating segment is SeaMoney, which covers digital-financial services. Many of the countries Sea operates in are chronically underbanked, with consumers and businesses lacking access to digital banking and basic financial services. SeaMoney is helping to facilitate these transactions in emerging-market economies.\n\nThe third, and arguably most important, operating segment is e-commerce platform Shopee. Gross merchandise value (GMV) traversing its platform totaled $23.6 billion in Q1, which equates to $94.4 billion on an annual run rate basis. For some context, Shopee saw $10.3 billion in GMV for the entirety of 2018. This demonstrates just how quickly Sea's online marketplace has scaled and explains why billionaire investors are so excited about the company's prospects.\n\nA trio of top-tier billionaires have gobbled up shares of Arm\n\nThe other hypergrowth stock that billionaires were busy buying instead of Nvidia is semiconductor juggernaut Arm Holdings (NASDAQ: ARM). Q1 saw three billionaires beef up their stakes or open a position, including two who were big-time sellers of Nvidia's stock (total shares purchased in parenthesis):\n\nKen Griffin of Citadel Advisors (1,170,604 shares).\n\nIsrael Englander of Millennium Management (424,329 shares).\n\nJeff Yass of Susquehanna International (127,848 shares).\n\nRenaissance Technologies was a buyer of Arm shares as well, but I left this well-known quantitative hedge fund off the list since its billionaire founder Jim Simons passed away in May.\n\nThe allure of Arm Holdings for billionaire investors is the company's moat. Arm is responsible for designing central processing units (CPUs), GPUs, and other forms of intellectual property (IP) for which it receives royalty and licensing revenue. In other words, industry giants like Nvidia and Microsoft are using Arm designs to develop the chips that will power the training of large language models and oversee generative AI solutions for years to come. Arm brings in all of its revenue from royalties and licensing.\n\nAside from having the most-influential businesses utilizing its IP, Arm should benefit from developing more energy-efficient solutions for the AI revolution and data-center economy. If Arm can continue to deliver cost savings for its customers, it'll further solidify its moat as a foundational company.\n\nPerhaps the biggest challenge Arm is going to face is convincing Wall Street and investors that its stock is worth a hefty premium. Despite surpassing Wall Street's consensus earnings-per-share (EPS) forecast in all three quarters since going public last year, Arm is currently valued at 80 times forward-year earnings. While some level of premium appears warranted given its competitive edge, a multiple of 80 times consensus EPS for the upcoming year, with revenue growth of around 20%, leaves little margin for error.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Nvidia right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Nvidia, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Nvidia wasn\u2019t one of them.

        "title": "Pepsi Is a Rock-Solid Dividend King, but So Is This Blue Chip Stock That's Down 12% in the Past 3 Months",
        "body": "Dividend stocks can be excellent investments to generate passive income. The best dividend-paying companies have steady earnings growth, and in turn, they increase their payouts to shareholders. The elite among them eventually may earn entry into the category of Dividend Kings -- companies that have raised their payouts annually for at least 50 consecutive years.\n\nIn addition to being a Dividend King, PepsiCo (NASDAQ: PEP) has a yield of 3.3% at its current share price -- high relative to the average yield of 1.3% for the S&P 500. It also has a fairly recession-resistant business, which makes it exactly the kind of consistent company that many risk-averse income investors look for.\n\nPepsi is a top-tier dividend stock and a familiar name to most consumers, but the less widely known Illinois Tool Works (NYSE: ITW) may be an even better Dividend King to buy now.\n\nImage source: Getty Images.\n\nGetting to know ITW\n\nIllinois Tool Works, which also goes by ITW, is a global industrial conglomerate with a diversified product portfolio spanning several industries. The company mainly sells products to businesses, so it would be understandable if you were unfamiliar with many of its brands.\n\nIt doesn't make massive earth-moving equipment or highly complex machinery. Rather, many of its products act as role players in larger systems. Here's a breakdown of its segments and some product examples.\n\nSegment Product Examples 2023 Revenue 2023 Operating Margin Automotive Fasteners, interior and exterior components, powertrain components $3.2 billion 17% Test & Measurement and Electronics Laboratory testing and assembly equipment, accessories, consumables, aftermarket parts and services $2.8 billion 24% Food Equipment Advanced warewash, services, equipment for cooking, refrigeration, and food processing $2.6 billion 27% Construction Products Fasting solutions, complementary fasteners and accessories, construction design and engineering software $2 billion 28% Welding Welding equipment, specialty consumables, safety solutions $1.9 billion 32% Polymers & Fluids Engineered adhesives, sealants, coatings, lubricants, additives, automotive wiper blades, cleaners $1.8 billion 27% Specialty Products Zippers and six-pack rings for packaged goods, medical device products, aircraft ground support equipment, coating and metalizing businesses for product branding and national security markets $1.7 billion 27%\n\nData source: Illinois Tool Works.\n\nOne thing that separates ITW from other industrial conglomerates is that none of its seven segments dominate its revenue mix. And aside from automotive -- which has been struggling in North America but growing rapidly in China -- all of its segments have excellent operating margins. The overall business notched an operating margin of more than 25% in 2023.\n\nStory continues\n\nManagement is projectng for an even better 26% to 27% operating margin in 2024 and a 30% operating margin by 2030.\n\nGrowth concerns\n\nITW's main challenge has been sluggish organic growth. Its organic revenue actually declined 0.6% last quarter. ITW is forecasting for just 1% to 3% organic growth for the year and 2% to 4% revenue growth. Earnings per share (EPS) growth is expected to be a little better at 6% to 10% for a total of $10.30 to $10.70 in full-year EPS -- partially thanks to a one-off accounting change.\n\nZoom out a bit further, and you'll see that ITW's EPS only increased by 20.6% during the past three years. That's not a terrible growth rate for a stodgy dividend payer, but it's not exactly great, either. Revenue has grown even slower, at 14.7%. However, take a look at an even longer time frame, and you'll notice that its earnings have grown much faster than revenue -- which is a testament to ITW becoming a more efficient, higher-margin business.\n\nITW EPS Diluted (TTM) Chart\n\nA leaner business with widening margins is better than an overextended model that leans heavily on sales growth at the expense of margins. But eventually, ITW will need to chart a path toward both wider margins and higher revenue, especially because there's a limit to how many efficiency improvements a business can make.\n\nIf you tune in to a typical ITW earnings call, you'll find that most of the conversation centers around margins. It might seem trivial to go back and forth about a single percentage point in margins. But ITW generated $16.1 billion in trailing 12-month revenue and $4.2 billion in operating income -- so each percentage point change in margin equates to a $160 million difference in operating income.\n\nSince ITW is involved in so many different industries (and generates a significant amount of sales from outside North America), no company is an exact competitor. However, some companies compete with it in one or more segments. And ITW has significantly higher margins than many of these peers.\n\nITW Operating Margin (TTM) Chart\n\nDespite having lower revenue than Genuine Parts, Parker Hannifin, W.W. Grainger, and Emerson Electric, ITW has the highest operating income of any company on this list. What makes it such a special company is that it combines size with wide margins across many different product categories. Conglomerates can often be bulky and inefficient, but ITW is a good example of an effective conglomerate that is benefiting from diversification.\n\nExpect a dividend raise soon\n\nLast August, ITW announced a 7% dividend hike to $1.40 per share per quarter. ITW typically announces its annual payout raises in the summer, with the first affected payout coming in October. Given the consistency of its dividend program, investors should expect an announcement sometime in the next couple of months.\n\nNot all Dividend Kings use stock buybacks as a primary way to return capital to shareholders, but ITW plans to repurchase $1.5 billion of its shares this year. By comparison, it distributed $418 million in dividends last quarter -- or roughly $1.7 billion during the past year. So on the surface, ITW's 2.4% yield may not look super attractive, but its capital return program is much stronger when one factors in the buyback program.\n\nHigh margins help ITW squeeze more profit from every dollar in revenue. But buying back stock reduces its share count, leading to higher earnings per share. During the past five years, it has reduced its shares outstanding by 7.8%, which has boosted EPS by 36.1% even as net income rose by 24.2%.\n\nBuybacks have also helped keep a lid on ITW's valuation. The recent sell-off in the stock paired with steady earnings growth has dropped its price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio down to just 23.4 -- which is below its three-, five- and seven-year median P/E ratios. And ITW was trading above these key levels just a few months ago.\n\nITW PE Ratio Chart\n\nITW is a well-rounded buy\n\nITW is a phenomenal business, but its valuation was pricey, and its revenue growth is weak. Now that the stock has sold off, the conglomerate's only bad quality is its low sales growth.\n\nThere are nearly perfect businesses, but there's no such thing as a perfect stock. The best companies are usually expensive relative to their trailing or projected earnings, while bad companies trade at cheap levels for good reasons.\n\nHowever, ITW is close to a perfect blue chip dividend stock. It is an extremely efficient business with high margins, an over 50-year track record of raising dividends, a sizable buyback program, and a reasonable valuation. The conglomerate model works well for ITW and helps the company offset much of the cyclicality of its various end markets.\n\nAdd it all up, and there's a lot to like about ITW as a top-tier Dividend King to buy and hold for years to come.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Illinois Tool Works right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Illinois Tool Works, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Illinois Tool Works wasn\u2019t one of them.

        "body": "Microsoft (NASDAQ: MSFT) is one of the world's largest and most influential tech companies. It's also the most valuable public company in the world at the moment at $3.4 trillion. In addition to providing cloud-computing services, market-leading operating systems, and productivity software, the technology giant is also at the forefront of the artificial intelligence (AI) revolution.\n\nStrong earnings results and emerging opportunities in AI have helped power strong performance for the company's stock lately. The software giant's share price is up 34% over the last year alone.\n\nEven more impressive, the stock has delivered a return of more than 1,160% since Satya Nadella became the company's CEO in February 2014. That means that if you invested $1,000 on the day Nadella took over on Feb. 4, 2014, your investment would now be worth more than $12,570.\n\nNadella has worked wonders at Microsoft\n\nWith Microsoft on a winning streak, it might be easy to forget that the company was facing some major challenges at the time Nadella took over in the CEO role. Due to some failed projects and unproductive strategic directions, the company and its stock had a rocky start to the 2010s. But Microsoft managed to deliver an incredible turnaround.\n\nNadella spearheaded a pivot to a new strategy that focused on subscription services. The company shifted Office and other software away from being one-time licensing purchases and instead started selling them on a subscription basis. This made the company's sales more dependable and also helped boost margins.\n\nHe also oversaw the strategic prioritization and growth of the company's Azure cloud infrastructure services. Azure has grown at an incredible rate over the last decade, and it currently stands as the second-largest player by market share -- trailing behind only Amazon's AWS.\n\nMicrosoft's cloud business is generating strong sales, growing rapidly, and posting impressive profit margins. It's also helped the company tap into emerging AI-driven demand, and the best is likely still to come.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Microsoft right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Microsoft, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Microsoft wasn\u2019t one of them.

        "title": "3 Stocks Cathie Wood Just Bought to Get Back on Track in the Second Half of 2024",
        "body": "It was a rough first half of the year for Cathie Wood. The co-founder, CEO, and investor at Ark Invest saw her family of aggressive growth exchange-traded funds lose badly to the market. But she's not throwing in the towel.\n\nWood publishes Ark's daily transactions, and she did a fair amount of buying on Monday to kick off the second half of 2024. Some of more intriguing names she purchased this week include Palantir (NYSE: PLTR), Archer Aviation (NYSE: ACHR), and Intellia (NASDAQ: NTLA). They're all existing positions. Let's take a closer look at some of her first purchases in the second half of this year.\n\n1. Palantir\n\nMost of Wood's largest holdings at Ark Invest are lagging the market this year, but Palantir isn't one of them. Shares of the software solutions provider for the intelligence community have soared 50% in 2024, more than quadrupling since the start of last year. It's currently the seventh largest holding across all of Ark's funds.\n\nMany tech providers have seen their business slow lately, but year-over-year revenue growth at Palantir has been accelerating in each of its past three quarters. The midpoint of its earlier guidance for the quarter that ended over the weekend implies that top-line gains will pick up the pace for the fourth straight financial update. The market has been bidding up stocks that have a legitimate artificial intelligence (AI) catalyst, but Palantir is actually earning its upticks with a business that is picking up the pace.\n\nImage source: Getty Images.\n\nThe big gains are exciting, but it also finds some Wall Street pros rethinking their enthusiasm. The last major analyst move happened less than two weeks ago, when Brian White at Moness Crespi downgraded the stock from neutral to sell on valuation concerns. He's generally concerned about AI and enterprise software stocks that have been moving higher despite an uninspiring earnings season. His $20 price target is 23% lower than where the stock was at Monday's close.\n\nPalantir's latest guidance suggests that business will slow in the second half of this year, but momentum is on its side. One of the more encouraging trends at Palantir is how the company that once leaned almost entirely on government contract work is now thriving as it turns to Corporate America to pitch its high-tech solutions. It's working. The 40% jump it posted in commercial revenue in its latest quarter nearly doubled the 21% overall increase on the top line.\n\nValuations will be a concern for any stock that's a four-bagger over the past 18 months. However, don't overlook Palantir's improving fundamentals. This is more than just a play on hot market buzzwords.\n\nStory continues\n\n2. Archer Aviation\n\nOne of Wood's purchases on Monday that isn't doing as well as Palantir this year is Archer Aviation. The stock has plummeted 44% in 2024, even though it did more than triple last year.\n\nWood owns a couple of companies specializing in next-gen short-distance air travel, and Archer is one of her biggest bets in this space. Archer offers electric vertical takeoff and landing (eVOTL) aircraft that it hopes will help get affluent clients around densely populated cities faster than conventional surface-hugging options.\n\nArcher is a pre-revenue player that's naturally losing money as it scores potential lucrative partnership deals for its coming fleet of high-tech air taxis. Last month it announced plans for an air mobility network that will serve five key locations across the San Francisco area. Investors are hoping that once the fleet starts to take off, the shares will follow suit.\n\n3. Intellia Therapeutics\n\nIntellia Therapeutics can't seem to catch a break. Shares of the poorly performing gene-editing stock has declined 26% this year and is trading 36% lower since the start of last year. Intellia is developing some CRISPR-based therapies, and it even has a couple of them entering the critical third phase of clinical trials.\n\nIntellia announced last week that its CFO would be stepping down. It's not a good look when the primary bean counter is leaving the company, but that doesn't mean something is amiss. Executives leave for many different reasons. As long as Intellia continues to deliver promising developments on her potential bar-raising therapies, you can't blame Wood for buying on the dip.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Palantir Technologies right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Palantir Technologies, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Palantir Technologies wasn\u2019t one of them.

        "title": "Time to Pounce: 2 Ultra-High-Yield Dividend Stocks That Are Begging to Be Bought for the Second Half of 2024 (and Beyond)",
        "body": "There are a lot of ways for investors to grow their wealth. They can buy Treasury bonds, a commodity like oil or gold, or purchase a home and let it increase in value over time. But when compared to other asset classes, stocks have delivered the highest average annual return over the last century.\n\nOne of the best aspects of putting your money to work on Wall Street is that, with thousands of stocks and exchange-traded funds (ETFs) to choose from, there's a very high probability of one or more securities matching your risk tolerance and investment goals.\n\nAlthough growth stocks have driven all three major indexes to record levels in 2024, it's dividend stocks that have handily outperformed on Wall Street over the last half-century.\n\nImage source: Getty Images.\n\nIn 2023, the investment advisors at Hartford Funds, in collaboration with Ned Davis Research, released a comprehensive report on the advantages dividend stocks bring to the table for investors. In particular, researchers compared the performance of dividend-paying companies to non-payers over the prior 50 years (1973-2023).\n\nBased on their findings, dividend stocks averaged a 9.17% annual return over a half-century, and did so while being 6% less volatile than the broad-based S&P 500. This compares to a more modest 4.27% average annual return for non-payers, which were 18% more volatile than the benchmark index.\n\nThe biggest challenge for income seekers is avoiding a yield trap -- i.e., a company with a broken operating model whose falling share price has artificially pumped up its dividend yield. Thankfully, safe, ultra-high-yield dividend stocks do exist.\n\nWhat follows are two ultra-high-yield dividend stocks -- companies with yields that are at least four times higher than the current yield (1.33%) of the S&P 500 -- that can be confidently pounced on by opportunistic income seekers in the second half of 2024.\n\nRealty Income: 5.98% yield\n\nThe first high-octane dividend stock that investors can pile into for the second half of the year is premier retail real estate investment trust (REIT) Realty Income (NYSE: O). Realty Income doles out its dividend on a monthly basis, and has increased its payout for a jaw-dropping 107 consecutive quarters.\n\nO Dividend Chart\n\nAs you're liable to note from Realty Income's stock chart, it hasn't participated in the current bull market rally. The reason for its poor performance over the last two years is primarily the result of monetary policy changes from the Federal Reserve.\n\nBeginning in March 2022, the nation's central bank began undertaking its most aggressive rate-hiking cycle since the early 1980s. During this process, yields on short-term U.S. Treasury bills soared. Instead of buying various REITs, investors have opted to generate similar yields from purchasing Treasury bills, which have almost nonexistent risk to invested principal.\n\nStory continues\n\nHowever, this dynamic is unlikely to continue for much longer. Even though core inflation has remained stubbornly high, the Fed is more likely to reduce interest rates than increase them, as evidenced by the recent movement we've witnessed in Treasury bond yields. With Realty Income's yield rising to 6%, this absolutely puts this monthly dividend icon back on the radar.\n\nWhat makes Realty Income the company that other retail REITs envy is its massive, but exceptionally resilient, commercial real estate (CRE) portfolio. As of the end of March, the company owned nearly 15,500 CRE properties. But here's the kicker: Approximately 90% of its total rent \"is resilient to economic downturns and/or isolated from e-commerce pressures,\" according to the company.\n\nRealty Income's not-so-subtle secret is that it tends to lease stand-alone stores to time-tested, brand-name businesses that provide basic need goods and services. For instance, grocery stores, convenience stores, dollar stores, home improvement, drugstores, and automotive service lessees collectively account for 42% of annualized contractual rent. Consumers will need food, beverages, prescription medicines, and vehicle maintenance/repairs, regardless of how well or poorly the U.S. economy is performing.\n\nWhat's more, Realty Income has a superior track record relative to other S&P 500 REITs when it comes to tenant occupancy. Since the start of this century, its median occupancy rate of 98.2% is 400 basis points higher than the median occupancy rate for S&P 500 REITs.\n\nAnother positive for current and prospective investors is that Realty Income has been fortifying its existing CRE portfolio and expanding into new channels. For instance, its January 2024 acquisition of Spirit Realty Capital was complementary to its existing CRE portfolio, but also opened doors in new industries.\n\nLast but not least, Realty Income's stock is trading at a historically cheap valuation, relative to its future cash flow. Whereas shares have averaged a multiple of 17.3 times cash flow over the trailing-five-year period, opportunistic income seekers can buy into the Realty Income growth story right now for 11.8 times forecast cash flow in 2025.\n\nImage source: Getty Images.\n\nPfizer: 6% yield\n\nThe second ultra-high-yield dividend stock that's begging to be bought for the second half of 2024 (if not well beyond) is pharmaceutical titan Pfizer (NYSE: PFE). Although Pfizer isn't guaranteed to raise its payout on an annual basis, its current yield of 6% is safe.\n\nPfizer, like Realty Income, has been left in the dust by the current bull market rally. As I've pointed out previously, Pfizer's underperformance is a reflection of it being a victim of its own success.\n\nPfizer is one of a handful of drugmakers that successfully developed therapies for COVID-19. In 2022, the company's COVID-19 vaccine (Comirnaty) and oral therapy (Paxlovid) brought in north of $56 billion in combined revenue. This year, combined sales for these blockbuster treatments will total around $8 billion. For those of you keeping score at home, this is a $48 billion sales decline that Wall Street and investors have had to come to terms with.\n\nHowever, perspective changes everything. Though COVID-19 sales aren't close to what they once were, Pfizer wasn't generating a cent in COVID-19 revenue prior to the pandemic. This estimated $8 billion in sales in 2024, coupled with organic growth from existing product lines and newly launched therapeutics, has lifted annual sales from $41.9 billion in 2020 to a mid-range estimate from $60 billion this year.\n\nDigging a bit deeper, Pfizer's March-ended quarter saw sales, excluding COVID-19 therapies, jump by 11% on a constant-currency basis. Continued double-digit operational growth from blockbuster blood-thinning drug Eliquis suggests Pfizer's total portfolio is considerably stronger now than it was four years ago.\n\nAnother reason for current and prospective investors to be excited about the future is Pfizer's $43 billion acquisition of cancer-drug developer Seagen, which closed in December. Despite buyout-related costs weighing on Pfizer's 2024 earnings per share (EPS), this combination should result in meaningful cost savings and improved EPS in 2025 and beyond. Moreover, this deal vastly expands Pfizer's oncology pipeline and provides a greater-than $3 billion boost to annual sales right off the bat.\n\nLike Realty Income, Pfizer has macro factors in its corner. Since we have no control over when we become ill or what ailment(s) we develop, demand for everything from prescription medicines to devices tends to remain constant in any economic climate. The point is that Pfizer is highly resistant to economic downturns.\n\nThe final piece of the puzzle is that Pfizer's stock is cheaper than it's been in a very long time. Shares of the company recently hit their lowest level in a decade. Further, shares are valued at roughly 10 times forward-year earnings, which is modestly lower than the average multiple of 11 times forward-year EPS that Pfizer's stock has traded at over the prior five years.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Realty Income right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Realty Income, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Realty Income wasn\u2019t one of them.

        "body": "Suze Orman Tells 35-Year-Old 'You Are Too Young To Have Any Money In CDs' And Should Be Focusing On ETFs\n\nIn a recent episode of her \"Women & Money\" podcast, personal finance expert Suze Orman offered critical advice to Brett, a 35-year-old caller. Brett, who earns $93,000 annually with no debt, was concerned about his retirement savings and sought guidance on improving his financial strategy.\n\nDon't Miss:\n\nHe explained that he maxes out his Roth IRA annually, with $14,000 currently in CDs, and contributes 5% of his income to a Roth TSP, matched by his employer, and invested in Lifecycle funds, totaling $54,000. Brett asked Orman if he should contribute more or diversify his investments, especially since he sees his peers with substantial retirement savings and feels inadequate in comparison.\n\nOrman's first piece of advice was to stop comparing himself to others. \"The first thing you should do, Brett, is stop comparing yourself to other people. What others have, or claim to have, does not matter,\" she said. \"You only need to have the amount of money that makes you secure so that you can support yourself in retirement, your family, or whatever.\"\n\nShe highlighted the mistake of investing in CDs at a young age, especially within a Roth account. \"You are too young to have any money in certificates of deposit, especially in a Roth account at the age of 35. You need to be going for growth with ETFs and individual stocks,\" Orman advised.\n\nTrending: Elon Musk and Jeff Bezos are bullish on one city that could dethrone New York and become the new financial capital of the US. Investing in its booming real estate market has never been more accessible.\n\nTo illustrate the missed opportunity, Orman pointed out that if Brett continued investing $8,000 a year in CDs at a 5% return, he would have $600,000 after 30 years. However, if he invested the same amount in the market with ETFs at a 10% return, he could accumulate $1.7 million, which is $1.1 million more. She added, \"If you work till you are 70, you could have $2.8 million. Now, that is just your Roth IRA. At 5%, all you would have is essentially $850,000. So, what is it, Brett? You want $850,000 at the age of 70 or $2.8 million?\"\n\nOrman also advised Brett to ditch life cycle funds, which she believes limit growth potential. \"I don't like life cycle funds. I don't like target date mutual funds. Look for index funds and manage your money, investing it for growth at this age,\" she recommended. This strategy, she suggested, could easily yield $7 or $8 million by retirement.\n\nStory continues\n\nOrman encouraged Brett to contribute more but critiqued his current investment choices rather than the amount he saved. \"How are you doing right now? I would give you maybe a C- and not because of the amount you're saving, but because of how you are investing it.\"\n\nOrman\u2019s advice underscores the importance of growth-oriented investments for young professionals. By avoiding conservative options like CDs and life cycle funds and focusing on ETFs and individual stocks, Orman firmly believes Brett can significantly enhance his retirement savings.\n\nNo matter what you choose, it's important to prioritize personal financial goals over comparisons and adopt strategies that maximize growth potential. For personalized advice tailored to your specific situation, consulting a financial advisor can be invaluable in ensuring your investments align with your long-term objectives.\n\nRead Next:\n\nAre you rich?

        "title": "3 Stocks That Can Double Again in 2024",
        "body": "There are just a little more than 30 U.S. exchange-listed companies with market caps greater than $1 billion that more than doubled in the first half of this year. It's fair to say that most of them won't repeat the feat through the final six months of 2024. It doesn't mean that all of them won't deliver an encore performance.\n\nCava (NYSE: CAVA), Hims & Hers Health (NYSE: HIMS), and Sweetgreen (NYSE: SG) are among handful of names that have already doubled this year. They have a shot at doubling again before the end of 2024. Let's take a closer look.\n\n1. Cava Group: Up 116%\n\nInvestors are often smart to steer clear of freshly minted IPOs, but Cava has proven to be a tasty exception to the rule. The fast-growing chain of Mediterranean fast-casual restaurants went public at $22 in the springtime of last year. It nearly doubled to $42.98 by the end of 2023. It has gone on to more than double this year, a four-bagger for those who got in on the IPO less than 13 months ago.\n\nCava closed out its latest fiscal quarter with 323 locations, but it's less than a third of the way to its goal of having 1,000 locations open by 2032. The brand's growing appeal and some of its unique product offerings have also translated well to the upscale grocery level as a seller of consumer packaged goods.\n\nImage source: Getty Images.\n\nGrowth and top-line store-level performance have slowed since Cava's first quarter as a public company when revenue soared 62% on the strength of brisk expansion and an 18.2% jump in comparable-store sales. Revenue in its latest report rose 30%, fueled largely by a 23% surge in its open locations. Comps rose a mere 2.3%, and a closer look could prove problematic. The modest comps figure is the result of a 3.5% increase from menu price and product mix, weighed down by a 1.2% decline in guest traffic.\n\nThis isn't as problematic as it seems. For starters, Cava's scalability has scored it better-than-expected profitability in every quarter as a public company. Its adjusted earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization (EBITDA) nearly doubled in its latest quarter.\n\nWatching a hot chain go through a slowdown in traffic can be scary, but Cava actually raised its guidance when it announced its first-quarter results in late May. It was initially eyeing a 3% to 5% increase for the entire 2024 fiscal year. Now it's eyeing a 4.5% to 6.5% increase. Put another way, business is expected to pick up again at the store level to give the aggressive chain expansion more oomph.\n\n2. Hims & Hers Health: Up 127%\n\nThe promise of telehealth is a win-win on paper. Using videoconferencing to connect someone requiring a medical consultation with a licensed or trained professional is cheaper, faster, and more discreet than conventional in-office visitations. However, the medium has generally failed to deliver profitable and sustainable growth.\n\nStory continues\n\nHims & Hers Health could be the exception. Hims was founded seven years ago, initially leaning on telehealth to sell hair loss and erectile dysfunction treatments that require a medical prescription. It would go on to double its target audience by launching Hers, offering birth control and flibanserin. It would eventually tackle mental health, and earlier this year it became a source to secure the wildly popular GLP-1 weight loss injections.\n\nGrowth has been stellar. Revenue gains have clocked in at 46% or better for every quarter since the company went public three years ago. It has finally broken out of the red, clocking in with back-to-back quarters of profitable results. There are regulatory risks here if there's a crackdown on telehealth prescriptions, but it may be too late to put that genie back in the bottle.\n\n3. Sweetgreen: Up 167%\n\nLet's close out with another fast-growing restaurant chain. In a year in which tech and crypto dominate the names of stocks that doubled, Sweetgreen is living up to its name for its fortunate 2024 investors. The company's fast-casual eateries specializing in premium salads and warm bowls are rocking, and the stock's 167% year-to-date burst makes it one of 2024's biggest consumer-facing gainers.\n\nUnlike Cava, Sweetgreen was a dud after its initial IPO pop. It went public at $28 in 2021, briefly trading north of $50 before whittling its way down to the high single digits by late last year. The starting line matters here. Sweetgreen is growing roughly in line with Cava these days. Revenue rose 26% in its latest quarter on a 5% uptick in comps. However, it's still not profitable.\n\nThe catalyst for continued growth here is similar to what could drive Cava higher. These are high-end fast casual concepts that appeal to young and affluent professionals. The return to in-office work should continue to drive weekday lunch traffic to both chains, and brand appeal should only continue to grow as the year plays out.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Cava Group right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Cava Group, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Cava Group wasn\u2019t one of them.

        "title": "Social Security: The Average Retiree Could Collect $740 More per Month With This Simple Move",
        "body": "Most older adults will rely on Social Security to some degree in retirement. A whopping 88% of current retirees depend on their benefits, according to a 2024 poll from Gallup, with 60% of that group saying Social Security is a major income source.\n\nSome retirees even rely on their benefits as their only source of income. Even if you have a robust nest egg, if you end up living a long lifespan, there's a chance your savings will run out eventually.\n\nThe more you can do to maximize your benefits now, the better shape you'll be in down the road. No matter what your financial situation looks like, there's one simple strategy that could help the average retiree increase their benefits by more than $700 per month.\n\nImage source: Getty Images.\n\nThe age at which you file could make or break your retirement\n\nDetermining what age to begin taking Social Security is one of the most important retirement decisions you'll ever make.\n\nYour claiming age will directly affect how much you receive each month, and in general, your benefit amount is locked in once you file -- save for annual cost-of-living adjustments. In other words, this choice will have a lifelong impact on your finances.\n\nYou can begin taking retirement benefits as early as age 62. By waiting until your full retirement age -- which is age 67 for everyone born in 1960 or later -- you'll receive 100% of your benefit based on your work history. If you hold off even longer until age 70, you'll collect your full benefit plus a bonus amount each month.\n\nImage source: The Motley Fool.\n\nThese adjustments are generally permanent, and they can be significant, too. Claim at age 62, and your benefits will be reduced by up to 30% per month. Wait until age 70, and you'll collect a bonus of at least 24% per month on top of your full payments.\n\nFor the average worker, that adds up to hundreds of dollars per month. According to 2023 data from the Social Security Administration, the average retired worker collects around $1,298 per month in benefits at age 62. At age 70, though, the average benefit is around $2,038 per month -- a difference of $740 per month.\n\nDelaying benefits isn't always the best move\n\nWaiting until age 70 can be a fantastic move if your savings are falling short or you simply want to maximize your retirement income. However, it won't be the right strategy for everyone, and there are good reasons to consider claiming early, too.\n\nFor one, claiming earlier can be smart if you have reason to believe you may not live well into your 70s or beyond. While it's not the most pleasant topic to think about, if you're battling health issues, claiming early could give you more time to enjoy your benefits than if you were to delay.\n\nStory continues\n\nFiling early can also be a strategic decision if your spouse is also entitled to retirement benefits. One of you may choose to claim early to provide some extra income early in retirement, while the other delays to earn larger checks. This approach can help you retire sooner without having to sacrifice as much income.\n\nDeciding when to take Social Security is a highly personal decision that depends on several factors, but if your primary goal is to maximize your income, delaying benefits is one of the best moves you can make. Waiting a few years to file boosts the average retiree's income by hundreds of dollars per month, which can set you up for a far more comfortable retirement.\n\nThe $ 22,924 Social Security bonus most retirees completely overlook\n\nIf you're like most Americans, you're a few years (or more) behind on your retirement savings. But a handful of little-known \"Social Security secrets\" could help ensure a boost in your retirement income. For example: one easy trick could pay you as much as $22,924 more... each year! Once you learn how to maximize your Social Security benefits, we think you could retire confidently with the peace of mind we're all after. Simply click here to discover how to learn more about these strategies.\n\nView the \"Social Security secrets\" \u203a\n\nThe Motley Fool has a disclosure policy.\n\nSocial Security: The Average Retiree Could Collect $740 More per Month With This Simple Move was originally published by The Motley Fool",

        "title": "Chinese firms eye Morocco as way to cash in on US electric vehicle subsidies",
        "body": "TANGIERS, Morocco (AP) \u2014 After the United States passed new subsidies designed to boost domestic electric vehicle production and cut into Beijing\u2019s supply chain dominance, Chinese manufacturers began investing in an unlikely place: Morocco.\n\nIn the rolling hills near Tangiers and in industrial parks near the Atlantic Ocean, they have announced plans for new factories to make parts for EVs that may qualify for $7,500 credits to car buyers in the United States.\n\nSimilar investments have been announced in other countries that share free trade agreements with the United States, including South Korea and Mexico.\n\nBut few countries have seen the kind of boom that Morocco has.\n\nAt least eight Chinese battery makers have announced new investments in the North African kingdom since President Joe Biden signed the Inflation Reduction Act, the $430 billion U.S. law designed to fight climate change, according to an Associated Press tally.\n\nBy moving operations to U.S. trading partners like Morocco, Chinese players that have long dominated the battery supply chain are seeking a pathway to cash in on increasing demand from American carmakers like Tesla and General Motors, said Kevin Shang, a senior battery analyst at the consulting firm Wood Mackenzie.\n\n\u201cChinese companies definitely don\u2019t want to miss this big party,\" he said.\n\nThe United States and European Union have both imposed major new tariffs on Chinese vehicle imports since May. The United States also finalized eligibility rules governing the tax credits in May. The latter limit companies with ties to U.S. adversaries, but give carmakers time to reduce their reliance on China. To qualify for the subsidies, carmakers cannot source critical minerals or battery parts from manufacturers in which China and other \u201cforeign entities of concern\u201d control more than 25% of the company or its board.\n\nCritics say the rules are a giveaway to China and will extend its EV dominance. The Biden administration says the rules pave the way for billions in investment in EV manufacturing in the United States.\n\nBetween East and West\n\nIn Morocco, a largely agrarian economy where the median income is $2,150 a month, giant industrial parks full of American, European and Chinese component makers have sprung up in the rural outskirts of Tangiers, Kenitra and El Jadida.\n\nExpanding on infrastructure that has made Morocco a car manufacturing hub, they hope to meet growing demand and overcome rules designed to exclude them from the incentives the Inflation Reduction Act is injecting into the U.S. car market, the world's second-largest.\n\nStory continues\n\nThe rules \u201chave led Chinese producers to increase investment in countries with whom the US has free trade agreements, namely South Korea and Morocco, to get past some IRA barriers,\u201d the policy research firm Rhodium Group said in a report earlier this year.\n\nSome of the new China investments in Morocco explicitly cite the new U.S. subsidies as a reason.\n\nMany are joint ventures that have cited their ability to tinker with board seats and governance to comply with U.S. rules.\n\nThat includes CNGR, one of China's largest battery cathode producers, which in September announced a $2 billion plan to build what it called a \u201cbase in the world and pan-Atlantic region\u201d in a joint venture with the Moroccan royal family\u2019s investment group, Al Mada.\n\nThough CNGR owns slightly more than a 50% stake in the project, Thorsten Lahrs, CEO of its Europe division, said he's confident its cathodes can qualify for the tax credits and change its board composition if necessary. If not, the company would pivot to other markets, including Europe, which just hiked tariffs on electric vehicles imported from China.\n\n\u201cTo ride the wave of the IRA, you have to execute fast and comply with its regulations,\u201d he said in an interview before the U.S. finalized its rules. \u201cWe have flexibility to be able to comply with all the changes in interpretation or rules.\u201d\n\nThe Chinese battery projects include at least three joint ventures and several that reference Morocco's trade ties with the United States.\n\nThe largest among them is Chinese-German battery-maker Gotion High-Tech, which signed a deal with Morocco last year for $6.4 billion investment to construct Africa\u2019s first electric vehicle battery factory.\n\nInvestments also include Youshan, a joint venture backed by Korean giant LG Chem and China\u2019s Huayou Cobalt. It declined to provide details about the size of their investment but said the Morocco base means their cathodes \u201cwill be supplied to the North American market and subsidized by the U.S. Inflation Reduction Act as Morocco is a signatory to the U.S. Free Trade Agreement.\u201d\n\nLG Chem said the venture would adjust ownership shares as necessary to comply with U.S. rules.\n\nChina\u2019s BTR Group's announcement of a cathode factory in April noted that Morocco\u2019s trade status with the United States and Europe would ensure \u201ca seamless entry for the majority of its manufactured products into these regions.\u201d\n\nAbdelmonim Amachraa, a supply chain expert who previously worked in Morocco\u2019s Ministry of Industry and Trade, said Morocco was profiting from its \u201cability to coexist when a link can\u2019t be found between China and the United States.\u201d\n\nOfficials in Morocco have publicly and privately worked to foster ties up and down the automotive supply chain in both the East and the West. The country hosts more than 250 companies that manufacture cars or their components, including Stellantis and Renault as well as Chinese, Japanese, American and Korean factories that make seats, engines, shock absorbers and wheels. The industry exports almost $14 billion in cars and parts annually.\n\nAs the world transitions to electric vehicles, Morocco may appear to be a surprising beneficiary as China, the United States and Europe compete for market share. But its officials worry that anti-competitive policies like tariffs and subsidies could ultimately make it more difficult to lure investment.\n\nRyad Mezzour, the country\u2019s minister of industry and trade, said in an interview that all the new investment doesn't tell the full story. Morocco has also lost out on some projects due to what he called \u201ca new age of protectionism.\"\n\nA giant loophole\n\nThe investment has been a boon to countries like Morocco. But in Washington, Chinese firms have raised alarm by angling to access the American subsidies.\n\n\u201cUnder the Biden administration\u2019s electric vehicle regulations, America\u2019s working families will have to watch their hard-earned tax dollars go to line the pockets of Chinese billionaires and businesses with links to the Chinese Communist Party,\u201d U.S. Rep. Jason Smith, a Missouri Republican, said of the new guidelines.\n\nBut at issue are the complexities of both the electric vehicle supply chain and the Inflation Reduction Act, which seeks to grow adoption of EVs and boost domestic manufacturing, too.\n\nThe U.S. Energy and Treasury departments have tried to strike a delicate balance, working to reduce reliance on Chinese manufacturers while also ensuring enough vehicles qualify for the credits. The Department of Energy did not respond to questions about what its rules meant for Chinese investments in countries that share free trade agreements with the United States. But in a statement, a spokesperson called the transition to electric vehicles \u201can industry-wide, global trend\u201d and said new policies \u201chelp the US strengthen its energy security and competitiveness\u2014including outcompeting China.\u201d\n\nChina has spent years subsidizing companies that extract critical battery minerals, manufacturers of cathodes, anodes and electrolyzers and carmakers like BYD. Those companies' eagerness to invest in Morocco to cash in on the Inflation Reduction Act shows how decoupling Chinese manufacturers from the supply chain will take years, if not decades, said Chris Berry, an adviser to battery companies and investors.\n\n\u201cThere is not going to be a lithium ion battery supply chain that does not have Chinese influence for a long time,\u201d Berry said.\n\n___\n\nThe Associated Press\u2019 climate and environmental coverage receives financial support from multiple private foundations.

        "body": "Now that we're officially halfway through 2024, it's time to reflect on where the stock market has been. Although no one knows what the market will do in the short term, we can try to filter out the noise and be aware of what's driving broader themes. A good place to start is by looking at sector performance.\n\nThere are 11 sectors in the S&P 500. And only two of them -- tech and communications -- are outperforming the index. Right off the bat, it tells you that growth-heavy sectors are doing well, and value and income stocks are lagging. Dig deeper, and you'll find that mega-cap growth, more so than smaller growth stocks, are driving the bulk of the gains in the major indexes.\n\nInvestors looking for buying opportunities outside of mega caps have come to the right place. Here's why these Motley Fool contributors are particularly excited about Okta (NASDAQ: OKTA), Celsius Holdings (NASDAQ: CELH), Ares Capital (NASDAQ: ARCC), NextEra Energy (NYSE: NEE), and Home Depot (NYSE: HD).\n\nImage source: Getty Images.\n\nPlease identify yourself\n\nDemitri Kalogeropoulos (Okta): It's a great time to get excited about Okta stock again. The software-as-a-service specialist, which sells cybersecurity and digital identity management services, is trading at about where it was at the beginning of the year. Yet its prospects are brightening.\n\nSales in the most recent quarter were up a healthy 19% to $617 million. Almost all of the revenue figures are subscription-based, too, which gives shareholders confidence that sales won't swing wildly during any upcoming industry slowdown.\n\nOkta is not profitable just yet, but that won't be true for long. Operating losses narrowed to 8% of sales last quarter from over 30% a year ago. Meanwhile, cash flow is solidly in positive territory, at nearly 40% of sales.\n\nAccording to its late May outlook, management is projecting a growth slowdown in the coming months, with second-quarter revenue gains decelerating to about 14%. Sales should rise by about 13% for the full fiscal year, too. But investors should look past that short-term volatility toward Okta's likely impressive earnings growth over the next several fiscal years.\n\nBuying the stock in July and patiently waiting for these benefits to accrue will put you in a great financial position when you reflect on your decision to buy this small but growing tech company.\n\nGet energized with Celsius\n\nAnders Bylund (Celsius Holdings): Known for its fitness-focused energy drinks, Celsius is brewing up impressive growth. Unlike archrivals Monster Beverage (NASDAQ: MNST) or Red Bull, Celsius focuses on providing a fitness-centric boost, with no artificial preservatives or flavors. It has proved to be a recipe for success, especially with the distribution expertise of Celsius partner PepsiCo.\n\nStory continues\n\nThe Pepsi deal is paying off big time, expanding Celsius' reach globally and boosting brand visibility. International growth is only getting started, leaving a ton of overseas opportunities to explore. The health-focused branding message should resonate just as strongly in valuable markets such as Canada, Australia, and Western Europe.\n\nThe stock isn't exactly cheap, trading at 61 times earnings and 9.4 times sales. But those valuation ratios are still a bargain compared to Celsius' loftier figures over the last couple of years. A 28.6% price drop in June took the edge off a skyrocketing stock chart, giving Celsius investors a chance to load up on shares at a lower price premium.\n\nThe heart of Celsius' idea is that its health-conscious growth story has many chapters left. The Pepsi partnership has proved effective, and the company is expanding its brand around the world. The stock isn't cheap, but it has earned every drop of that premium price tag. Those lofty ratios should calm down as it executes its profitable growth plans over the next few years.\n\nThere is room for a third global giant in the booming energy drink industry. Many have tried and failed to fill that role. With soaring sales and robust profit margins already under its belt, Celsius looks primed to get the job done. That's why its stock is a hot buy in July.\n\nAn attractive valuation, dividend, and business\n\nKeith Speights (Ares Capital): I have a condition I call investors' acrophobia. The higher the stock market goes, the more afraid I become. With the S&P 500 continuing to rise, my nervousness is increasing. But Ares Capital is the kind of stock I don't have qualms about in a pricey market.\n\nAres is a leading business development company (BDC). And its stock is dirt cheap, with shares trading at only 8.7 times forward earnings.\n\nThat attractive valuation isn't because the company's business is floundering. Its earnings continue to grow. CEO Kipp deVeer said in the first-quarter earnings press release, \"With our competitive advantages, we believe we are well positioned to build upon our nearly 20-year track record of generating attractive investment returns for our shareholders.\"\n\nThose competitive advantages include a stronger financial position and more investment professionals than its rivals have. Ares Capital has a longer history in the industry than most direct lenders. Unsurprisingly, the company has delivered significantly higher returns on equity (ROE) and total returns than other BDCs.\n\nIncome investors should love the forward dividend yield of over 9.3%. Even if you're not an income investor, this hefty yield gives Ares a head start on delivering exceptional returns.\n\nAre there risks associated with investing in a BDC that provides financing to middle-market businesses? Sure. However, Ares Capital has proved to be remarkably resilient, generating strong ROE during the financial crisis of 2008 and 2009 and the pandemic period of 2020 and 2021.\n\nWhether or not you have investors' acrophobia, Ares Capital looks like a great stock to buy in July.\n\nAny drop in this stock's price is an opportunity to buy\n\nNeha Chamaria (NextEra Energy): I recommended NextEra Energy in May, and while the stock surged during the month, it has come under a bit of pressure over the past couple of weeks or so. I believe the fall was unwarranted, and with NextEra Energy reminding investors yet again about its growth potential and plans, I am picking it as my top stock to buy now.\n\nInvestors were spooked when management announced plans to sell equity units worth $2 billion in mid-June. What they might have overlooked, though, is the reason the company is raising money via a share sale: to fund growth.\n\nAt its latest Europe investor presentation, NextEra Energy quoted an industry report projecting fourfold power demand growth in the U.S. over the next couple of decades versus the previous 20 years. As the owner and operator of the largest utility in the U.S., Florida Power & Light, NextEra is primed to benefit from any surge in power demand.\n\nTo top that, the company is also the world's largest producer of wind and solar energy and a leader in battery storage. It announced plans to invest $65 billion to $70 billion over the next four years with a potential to develop 36.5 to 46.5 gigawatts (GW) of new renewable and storage capacity through 2027.\n\nThat brings us back to why the fall of NextEra Energy stock after the company announced an equity sale was an overreaction. With its utility and renewables businesses, it could spend around $100 billion between 2024 and 2027. But equity issues are expected to be only about 5% of the company's total projected spending. It expects to fund the bulk of its growth through cash generated from operations and will rely more on debt than equity to fund the remaining portion.\n\nWith NextEra Energy further reiterating its adjusted earnings-per-share growth projection of 6% to 8% through 2027 and increases in dividends of around 10% through 2026, I believe any drop in the stock's price is an opportunity to buy and hold for the long term.\n\nHome Depot knows how to navigate a cyclical slowdown\n\nDaniel Foelber (Home Depot): In the long term, stock market winners are companies that can grow earnings over time through innovation, staying flexible, and savvy acquisitions. But in the short term, the market is often driven by narratives.\n\nRight now, the market is marching higher to the beat of the mega-cap growth drum. But behind the scenes, many industry-leading consumer-facing companies like Home Depot have seen their stock prices get left behind. The home-improvement retailer's stock is down year to date and up less than 10% over the last three years compared to a 24.3% gain in the S&P 500.\n\nAt least part of the sell-off is justified. Home Depot and its peer Lowe's Companies are facing a difficult housing market. Management commentary hasn't shied away from its impact on results.\n\nHigh volume in home sales is great for Home Depot and Lowe's because homebuying coincides with home improvement. But if homebuying is low or so expensive that consumers have little left over for home improvement, then they might be less inclined to pair pricey projects with a home purchase.\n\nThe economic indicators point to relatively expensive housing, record-high credit card debt, and some of the highest mortgage interest rates in the last decade -- all bad news for Home Depot.\n\nDespite these challenges, the company has continued investing through the cycle with new store openings and expansions. On June 18, it completed its $18.3 billion acquisition of SRS Distribution -- which boosts its building products and roofing materials offerings. Management has been targeting professional contractors as a key growth area that can help diversify the business to be less dependent on consumer sales.\n\nOn the surface, this strategy looks fairly aggressive, considering all the near-term challenges. But the company has historically been an excellent capital allocator and has the balance sheet needed to take market share during a slowdown rather than be passive.\n\nHome Depot is also a reliable dividend stock. In February, it announced a 7.7% increase to its dividend, bringing it to $2.25 per share per quarter, or $9 per year. The dividend is up 379% over the last decade and 65% over the last five years. With a yield of 2.6%, it's an excellent dividend stock to buy for patient investors who believe in the company's ability to navigate cyclical ebbs and flows.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Okta right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Okta, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Okta wasn\u2019t one of them.

        "title": "Should You Buy Broadcom Before or After the July 12 Stock Split? 1 Detail Gives Us the Answer.",
        "body": "A wide range of companies have announced stock splits this year after their share prices soared. When these events take place, companies issue additional shares to current stockholders, which lowers the price of each individual share proportionally. The goal is to make it easier for a wider range of investors to buy that particular stock.\n\nBroadcom (NASDAQ: AVGO) has scheduled its 10-for-1 stock split for after the close of trading on July 12; shares will begin trading on a split-adjusted basis as of the opening bell on July 15. The semiconductor and networking giant has benefited from the artificial intelligence (AI) boom, which boosted demand for its AI networking and custom accelerators. That lifted its revenues, and the stock price followed. It has gained nearly 90% over the past year and surpassed $1,800 for a time in June.\n\nThis top tech stock would make a solid long-term investment, but now the question is: Should you get in on the shares before the July 12 stock split or after? Let's consider arguments for both strategies -- and discover the one detail that offers us an answer.\n\nImage source: Getty Images.\n\nThe case for buying before the split\n\nA stock split doesn't change anything fundamental about a company or its stock. Though the per-share price will be lower, the maneuver doesn't impact valuation in any real way. That means that post-split, the stock actually could be more expensive than it was beforehand. This happened with Nvidia recently -- between the day it made its split announcement and the actual day of the event, the tech giant's shares climbed by nearly 30%.\n\nSo if you consider Broadcom a strong long-term player, it would be a great idea to go ahead and buy the stock now rather than waiting for it to complete what is simply a piece of financial juggling.\n\nAnd there are reasons to be optimistic about Broadcom. The combination of strong AI-related demand and its recent acquisition of cloud software company VMware look set to drive a new era of growth for the company. In its latest reported fiscal quarter, its revenue rose 43% to more than $12 billion thanks to these two elements. Since we're in the early days of the AI boom and VMware integration, there's likely a lot more growth to come.\n\nVMware revenue, from about $2.1 billion in Broadcom's fiscal first quarter, grew to $2.7 billion in its fiscal Q2 (which ended May 5), and management expects it to reach a $4 billion quarterly revenue run rate. And Broadcom forecasts AI revenue for fiscal 2024 of more than $11 billion.\n\nThe case for buying after the split\n\nThe argument for buying after the split is pretty straightforward too. True, post-split, Broadcom won't necessarily be any cheaper than it is today (unless the stock falls, and stock movements will be unrelated to the split). But a lower price could make it easier for some investors to buy the stock because if you plan on investing less than the stock's current share price, you will be able to do so without relying on fractional shares.\n\nStory continues\n\nSo, for example, today if you want to invest $500 in Broadcom and don't have the option through your broker of buying fractional shares (or if you choose not to), you won't be able to directly invest in the company. I say \"directly\" because you can always gain exposure to Broadcom through the many index funds and exchange-traded funds that include the stock in their holdings.\n\nBut if you want to avoid the fractional share route, you're probably better off buying the shares post-split.\n\nWhat should you do?\n\nBoth of these arguments are logical -- so which should you follow? Since the split is right around the corner, the decision should come down to the funds you have available to invest. If you plan on investing the amount of Broadcom's current share price or more, there's no reason to wait -- now is a great time to get in on this top AI player.\n\nHowever, if you're planning on investing less than the current share price, it may be a good idea to invest right after the stock split as you'll more easily be able to access full shares. Fractional shares are fine, but if your brokerage doesn't offer them, trying to get in on Broadcom today may be complicated. After the split, though, you won't have to worry about this.\n\nBut what if the stock rises or falls in the coming days, pushing valuation higher or lower? If you're a long-term investor, this won't matter for you, because it won't have much of an impact on your returns a few years down the road. It's impossible to reliably time the market so that you can buy any particular stock at its lowest price. But that's OK. Generally, buying a strong company at a fair price offers you a great chance of generating attractive returns over the long run.\n\nAnd before or after the upcoming stock split, Broadcom should make a compelling AI growth buy.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Broadcom right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Broadcom, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Broadcom wasn\u2019t one of them.

        "title": "Can Retirees Still Trust AT&T's 5.8% Dividend Yield?",
        "body": "U.S. wireless carrier AT&T (NYSE: T) is a polarizing stock among investors. Shares are down nearly 30% in price over the past decade, which is a tough pill to swallow. However, include AT&T's famous high-yielding dividend and shares generated a 50% positive return.\n\nIndeed, dividends can have a powerful impact on investment returns.\n\nMoreso than returns, retirees depend on dividends for the passive income they offer, which can help pay living expenses. For those investors, a high dividend yield they can trust to continue coming quarter after quarter matters above all.\n\nSo, can you trust AT&T's 5.8% yield?\n\nAT&T cut its dividend in 2022\n\nA company recently cutting its dividend probably doesn't instill confidence, but that's precisely what AT&T did in early 2022. The telecom company squandered much of the past decade on massive mergers to acquire DirecTV ($49 billion) and Time Warner ($85 billion) to expand into media. This was ultimately a failure, causing AT&T to sell DirecTV and spin off its Time Warner assets by 2022, leaving the company with over $200 billion in long-term debt.\n\nDividend investors hate seeing dividend cuts, but cutting the dividend was admittedly necessary. Cutting the dividend freed up cash flow to help pay down debt. With a cash infusion from spinning off Time Warner, AT&T reduced its long-term debt to $132 billion. There's more work ahead, but that's a massive relief, especially in a higher rate environment where any restructured debt will carry higher interest expenses.\n\nThe balance sheet is in far better shape now, enabling investors to focus on AT&T's cash flows to help determine the safety of its dividend. A healthier balance sheet means less risk of another cut if the business suffers an unexpected downturn. In other words, the cut has arguably made the dividend safer today.\n\nCan AT&T's cash flows support its dividend?\n\nJust think about all the things you do on your smartphone. You access the internet, stream, and stay in touch with friends and family. Most people will pay their AT&T bill over many others, even during hard times. That makes AT&T a steady business with reliable profits. AT&T's cash flow is dependable, fluctuating primarily due to how much the company invests in upgrading and maintaining its network.\n\nAT&T's free cash flow is its discretionary cash profits left after investing in the business. Management expects AT&T to generate free cash flow between $17 billion and $18 billion this year. The company spends approximately $2 billion on each quarterly dividend, meaning there is an $8 billion annual dividend expense. That's just 45% of AT&T's cash flow this year. AT&T's business would have to fall on its face for cash profits to fall enough for the company not to cover its dividend with cash.\n\nStory continues\n\nNever say never, but it's hard to imagine AT&T's telecom business collapsing like that. Business is thriving. The company added 349,000 net additions to its wireless business in Q1 and believes its 0.72% churn rate (how many customers leave) is the industry's best.\n\nThe dividend is healthy and the future is bright\n\nRetirees shouldn't worry about AT&T's dividend. It's on rock-solid financial ground now, barring an unforeseen disaster. AT&T's dividend should only become increasingly secure as the company continues to pay down debt in the coming years.\n\nPlus, its momentum in the wireless business should translate to earnings growth. Analysts estimate that AT&T will grow earnings by an annual average of 2% over the next three to five years. That won't rock your world, but it's enough to eke out occasional dividend raises without impacting the payout ratio.\n\nI wouldn't bet the farm that AT&T will outperform the broader stock market anytime soon, but retirees looking for a high dividend yield they can count on should look no further.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in AT&T right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in AT&T, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and AT&T wasn\u2019t one of them.

        "title": "Forget AMD in 2024: 2 Artificial Intelligence (AI) Stocks to Buy Instead",
        "body": "Over the last year, increased interest in artificial intelligence (AI) has spotlighted several tech stocks that could enjoy major gains as the industry develops. Chipmaker Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ: AMD) has seen its stock soar 150% since the start of 2023, driven primarily by investors' excitement over AI. AMD's second-largest market share in graphics processing units (GPUs) has made Wall Street bullish as similar offerings from Nvidia have flown off the shelves amid the increased demand for the high-powered chips.\n\nHowever, mediocre quarterly results, alongside a soaring share price, have tanked the value of AMD's stock. The company's business hasn't seen a big enough return on its investment in AI, suggesting there could be better options for backing the high-growth industry.\n\nAMD PE Ratio Chart\n\nThis chart uses price-to-earnings (P/E) ratios to compare the valuations of some of the most prominent names in AI. AMD's stock is by far the worst value, with a P/E of 238. However, two companies stand out as bargains compared to their peers: Intel (NASDAQ: INTC) and Alphabet (NASDAQ: GOOGL) (NASDAQ: GOOG).\n\nThese companies have expanding ventures in AI that could majorly pay off over the long term, with one investing in AI chip manufacturing and the other quickly growing in AI software.\n\nSo, forget AMD in 2024 and consider buying one of these AI stocks instead.\n\n1. Intel: Delivering growth in multiple areas of its business\n\nIntel investors haven't had it easy in recent years, with its stock down 35% since 2019. The company was once the biggest name in the chip market, dominating manufacturing and boasting a lucrative partnership with Apple as the leading chip supplier for its Macs. However, trouble keeping up with competitors like AMD and Nvidia caused Intel to fall behind and lose market share.\n\nYet, sometimes, the best test of a company is how it responds to challenges, and recent developments suggest Intel could come back strong in the coming years. The chipmaker has increased its market share in central processing units (CPUs) for three consecutive quarters. Since the fourth quarter of 2023, Intel's CPU share has risen from 61% to 64%, while AMD's has fallen from 36% to 33%.\n\nMoreover, recent earnings from Intel further highlight its gradual improvements. In Q1 2024, the company's revenue increased by 9% year over year to $13 billion. The company benefited from a 31% rise in client revenue, representing a spike in consumer sales. Meanwhile, its data center and AI segment posted revenue gains of 5%, with operating income hitting $184 million after the company reported losses of $69 million the year before.\n\nStory continues\n\nIntel is restructuring all areas of its business to prioritize long-term profit growth. The company is refocusing its business model around AI and manufacturing, with plans to build at least four plants in the U.S. and more abroad. Intel wants to become the country's leading AI chip manufacturer, which could allow it to profit from rising GPU demand throughout the industry.\n\nWith positive signs of growth and a bargain stock price, it's worth considering Intel stock over AMD in 2024.\n\n2. Alphabet: The best-valued way to invest in AI software\n\nAlphabet is home to some of the most widely recognized brands thanks to products like Android, YouTube, and the many offerings under Google. Alphabet's success has made it the world's fourth most valuable company, with a market cap above $2 trillion.\n\nGOOGL Chart\n\nThe tech giant has proven itself as one of the most reliable long-term investments. This year alone, Alphabet has outperformed many of its rivals in stock growth (as seen in the chart above). Yet, it has the lowest P/E out of these companies, indicating it is trading at the best value. Furthermore, Alphabet has the lowest stock price among these tech companies, potentially making its shares the most accessible.\n\nIn addition to trading at a bargain, Alphabet has significant potential in AI. The company was an early investor in the industry, first introducing AI to its search engine in 2001. Then, in 2016, the tech giant became an AI-first company, well ahead of many of its rivals. Its Google DeepMind AI research subsidiary is driving the company's innovation.\n\nMeanwhile, Alphabet's recently launched AI model, Gemini, could elevate its entire position in the industry by bringing generative upgrades across its product lineup.\n\nAlphabet likely has a bright future in tech and is just too good to pass up at its current price point, making it a screaming buy in 2024 and a better option than AMD.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Intel right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Intel, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Intel wasn\u2019t one of them. The 10 stocks that made the cut could produce monster returns in the coming years.\n\nConsider when Nvidia made this list on April 15, 2005... if you invested $1,000 at the time of our recommendation, you\u2019d have $757,001!*\n\nStock Advisor provides investors with an easy-to-follow blueprint for success, including guidance on building a portfolio, regular updates from analysts, and two new stock picks each month.

        "body": "Considering Microsoft Corp (MSFT) Ahead Of Earnings Report? Here's A Better Alternative\n\nMicrosoft Corp (NASDAQ:MSFT) CEO Satya Nadella has made the Redmond software giant the biggest beneficiary of the AI revolution thanks to his vision and strategy. In 2019, when Microsoft invested $1 billion in OpenAI, the company behind ChatGPT, hardly anyone noticed. But when ChatGPT was launched and the floodgates of generative AI innovation opened, Microsoft was seen as the leader in the AI arms race. Microsoft\u2019s investments in OpenAI have now swelled to $13 billion. The company's long list of AI catalysts includes the revival of Bing Search, AI assistant Co-pilot, and AI PCs, among many others.\n\nIs MSFT Overvalued?\n\nHowever, some believe the stock has run too much and needs a breather amid Wall Street's growing concerns that just a handful of companies now account for most of the market gains. Morgan Stanley's Lisa Shalett recently said in a note that the Magnificent Seven group of stocks, including MSFT, is poised to see \"radical deceleration\" in earnings growth, according to a report by Seeking Alpha. Goldman Sachs equity strategist David Kostin calculates that Microsoft's sales growth in the second quarter will come in at 15%, down from 17% in the previous quarter, as per another report by Seeking Alpha. The company is expected to report earnings on July 23. As the company gets too much spotlight and AI expectations from the stock are too high, any decline in growth in the upcoming earnings could cause the stock to fall.\n\nThere are always undervalued players in the market for those who know where to look. Let's discuss an AI underdog that analysts believe has more upside based on its strong growth catalysts.\n\nTrending: If there was a new fund backed by Jeff Bezos offering a 7-9% target yield with monthly dividends would you invest in it?\n\nTaiwan Semiconductor: A Better AI Stock Than MSFT?\n\nTaiwan Semiconductor Mfg. Co. Ltd. (NYSE:TSM) is one of the world\u2019s most important and biggest semiconductor companies. Tweaktown reports that the company's long list of customers includes tech giants like Apple, Nvidia, Qualcomm, AMD, and Broadcom, among many others. The AI revolution is expected further to bolster Taiwan Semiconductor's demand and market share. According to Tweaktown's report, the company has a whopping 70% to 80% share of the 5nm semiconductor market and a 90% share of the 3nm chips market. Data from consultancy firm TrendForce shows that Taiwan Semiconductor had a 60% share of the global foundry market as of 2021.\n\nTaiwan Semiconductor's AI Revenue Growth Projections\n\nTaiwan Semiconductor's chips are used in everything from smartphones to electric car sensors and PCs. However, the huge demand for high-end chips unlocked by the generative AI boom has made TSM a promising AI stock. During a first quarter earnings call, Taiwan Semiconductor's management said it expects revenue contribution from AI processors to double this year and account for low-teens percent of total revenue. Revenue from AI is expected to grow at a 50% CAGR over the next five years and account for over 20% of the company's total revenue by 2028.\n\nStory continues\n\nTaiwan Semiconductor's Moat in the Industry\n\nTaiwan Semiconductor's moat in the AI chips industry is strong and wide. Firstly, the high-end chip manufacturing industry isn't easy to enter, even for major companies. Blackridge Research and Consulting firm reports that establishing a single 3nm fab could cost up to $20 billion. On top of that, Taiwan Semiconductor's real strength lies in churning millions of chips with almost no defects \u2014 the company's yield is over 95%, according to the Atlantic Council. Only Samsung is expected to come close to Taiwan Semiconductor's quality and manufacturing capability in the coming years amid its huge investments and plans to foray into the fab industry. Other than Taiwan Semiconductor, it has no formidable competitors.\n\nDon\u2019t Miss: Elon Musk and Jeff Bezos are bullish on one city that could dethrone New York. Investing in its booming real estate market has never been more accessible.\n\nIs the China Threat Overblown?\n\nDespite its dominance in the AI chips industry, Taiwan Semiconductor's share price growth has been capped, and its valuation still looks attractive compared to its peers. The stock's forward P/E is 27.7 (47 for Nvidia and 46 for AMD). The biggest concern around TSM is a possible Chinese escalation against Taiwan since the company's major manufacturing operations are based in Taiwan. However, many analysts believe these concerns are overblown and the company has no short-term risks. They say China cannot afford to go into a direct conflict with the US. According to a report by the Hudson Institute, any disruption in Taiwan's semiconductor industry could result in a $1.6 trillion economic loss to the US. Taiwan Semiconductor's chip industry dominance is seen as a \u2018Silicon Shield' for Taiwan, which the country can use to deter attacks. Earlier this month, Taiwan Semiconductor's Chairman and CEO C.C. Wei said that it's \"impossible\" to move chip manufacturing outside of Taiwan and that 80% to 90% of chip manufacturing remains in the country.\n\nWall Street Thinks AI Boom Will Benefit Taiwan Semiconductor\n\nWall Street is also growing bullish on the company. Recently, Bernstein analyst Mark Li said that high-end phones and advanced nodes could result in Taiwan Semiconductor topping its 2024 guidance. The analyst thinks the company\u2019s data center revenue is growing as expected. Li increased his price target for TSM to $200 from $150. He expects Taiwan Semiconductor's revenue to increase by 25% and EPS by 28% in 2024. Earlier this month, BofA's Brad Lin also increased his price target for TSM to $180. Lin thinks new AI plans revealed by Apple and other companies at the Computex 2024 event would drive the on-device AI trend, benefiting TSMC, which the analyst called the \"key enabler\" of AI prosperity.\n\nThere Are Better High-Yield Opportunities\n\nThe current high-interest-rate environment has created an incredible opportunity for income-seeking investors to earn massive yields, but not through dividend stocks...

        "title": "Billionaire Bill Ackman Has Almost 20% of His Pershing Square Portfolio Invested in This \"Magnificent Seven\" Stock",
        "body": "The average investor can learn a lot by following some of the professionals in the industry. Take Bill Ackman, whose strategy -- probably influenced by the great Warren Buffett -- focuses on making concentrated bets in high-quality businesses trading at compelling valuations.\n\nAckman's hedge fund firm, called Pershing Square Capital Management, currently manages $10.8 billion in assets. Rather than blindly following his portfolio decisions, investors should try to understand why he owns what he does.\n\nOne of Ackman's top holdings is tech titan Alphabet (NASDAQ: GOOGL) (NASDAQ: GOOG). Let's look at what factors may have drawn the hedge fund manager's attention to this dominant \"Magnificent Seven\" company.\n\nQuality business\n\nPershing Square first purchased shares in Alphabet over a year ago during the first quarter of 2023. It might be surprising to see it quickly becoming a huge position. But Ackman went so far as to call this \"one of the world's greatest businesses.\" That might be a bold statement, but I wouldn't disagree with his assessment.\n\nMost readers are familiar with Google Search. With 91% share of the global search industry, this is undoubtedly Alphabet's bread-and-butter segment. Ackman calls out its powerful network effects and high barriers to entry.\n\nAcquired by the business in 2006 for over $1.6 billion, YouTube also deserves some attention. Not only does it possess network effects as well, but it supports Alphabet's dominance in the digital ad industry. Ackman believes that the business is well-positioned to continue growing its sales over time due to the shift away from offline advertising to online methods.\n\nAlphabet is poised to benefit from another secular trend, which is cloud computing. As IT spend transitions from on-site to off-premises, Google Cloud should continue its rise. This segment posted a 26% revenue gain in 2023, and it's now generating consistent operating income.\n\nIf you look through the Pershing Square portfolio, you'll realize that Ackman appreciates companies that are in a strong financial position. There are very few businesses in the world that can match Alphabet in this regard. As of March 31, it did carry $13.2 billion of long-term debt on the balance sheet. However, the company had $108.1 billion of cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities, virtually eliminating any financial risk.\n\nAI leader\n\nThe artificial intelligence (AI) boom is drawing lots of attention from the investment community. After Chat GPT was first launched in late 2022, the market was worried that Alphabet was falling behind rivals when it came to developing this technology and introducing new features. But Ackman believes that this concern was overblown.\n\nStory continues\n\nAlphabet was using AI in Search as far back as 2001. And nearly all of its offerings, from YouTube and Maps to Gmail and Google Cloud, all utilize AI in some way. The fact that this business has such wide reach means that it can launch new AI features to almost instant adoption. Plus, Alphabet has the financial resources and technological know-how to be one of the leaders in AI going forward.\n\nIs it too late to buy Alphabet stock?\n\nWith the benefit of hindsight, Ackman's purchase of Alphabet shares looked like an incredibly timely move. When his firm started buying the stock, it traded at a compelling forward price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio of just 16. This investment has worked out extremely well thus far, as shares are up 109% in the past 18 months.\n\nOf course, the situation isn't as much of a no-brainer these days. As of this writing, Alphabet stock sells at a forward P/E multiple of 24.4. While not as good as the price Ackman paid, I still think this valuation makes shares a smart buy today.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Alphabet right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Alphabet, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Alphabet wasn\u2019t one of them. The 10 stocks that made the cut could produce monster returns in the coming years.\n\nConsider when Nvidia made this list on April 15, 2005... if you invested $1,000 at the time of our recommendation, you\u2019d have $757,001!*\n\nStock Advisor provides investors with an easy-to-follow blueprint for success, including guidance on building a portfolio, regular updates from analysts, and two new stock picks each month.

The company supplies products and solutions for the manufacturing of chips and circuits.\n\nDane also continues to be bullish on Micron (MU) despite a mixed outlook that hammered the stock last week.\n\nFeeling FOMO around Nvidia right now \u2014 and ignoring some of its future competitors \u2014 would be understandable.\n\nOn June 18, Nvidia reached a market cap of $3.34 trillion, making it the highest-valued company globally \u2014 briefly surpassing tech heavyweights Microsoft (MSFT) and Apple (AAPL).

Nvidia execs predicted that demand for AI chips would continue to outstrip supply well into 2025.\n\nThe company is now beginning to build out AI factories, Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang told Yahoo Finance's Julie Hyman and Dan Howley.\n\n\"Now you have software to think of, you have automotive to think of, you have robotics to think of, and that's already pushing us easily past $10 trillion [market cap for Nvidia] by 2030,\" I/O Fund lead tech analyst Beth Kindig told Seana Smith and Brad Smith on Yahoo Finance's Morning Brief.\n\nNothing is guaranteed in tech land, Dane reminds the investing masses.\n\n\u201cI\u2019d love to pretend like I know exactly where AI is going over the next five years,\u201d he said. \u201cWe\u2019re all trying to understand and put the pieces together to derive investment theories and action in our client accounts.\"\n\nStory continues\n\nIn an episode of \"Opening Bid\", Bradesco head of equity strategy Ben Laidler made the case for a 100% gain in the S&P 500 over the next five years.

        "body": "Investors are keeping calm and carrying on as thoughts of a second Donald Trump presidency begin to percolate amid President Joe Biden's primetime debate debacle.\n\n\"The one takeaway from the debate last week was the market has sort of made its peace with Donald Trump being the next president,\" Bradesco head of equity strategy Ben Laidler said on my \"Opening Bid\" podcast (video above or listen here). \"We saw markets sort of edge up a little bit and we didn't see that volatility.\"\n\nTrump and Biden left debate watchers stunned, with the former spewing falsehoods and the latter appearing frail and out of touch.\n\nSince the debate aired the evening of June 27, though, the S&P 500 (^GSPC), Nasdaq Composite (^IXIC), and Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI) are only down fractionally.\n\nShares of market leader Apple (AAPL) have gained about 1.6% while Amazon (AMZN) has seen its stock trade sideways.\n\nMorgan Stanley strategist Mike Wilson said he received client interest in rotating into 2016 \"Trump Trades\" in the cyclical and small-cap space the morning after the debate.\n\n\"Market expectations for fiscal expansion, reflation, and less regulation under a Trump presidency drove these initial moves, in our view,\" Wilson said in a client note.\n\nOne area to watch to see if Laidler's thesis is fully correct: the sizzling AI trade.\n\nShares of AI bellwether Nvidia (NVDA) are off by 3% in the wake of the debate.\n\nSaid Laidler, \"I think investors are looking back to the first Trump presidency and thinking, you know, that was fairly pro-business and I made a lot of money \u2014 maybe we're going to get a repeat of that.\"\n\nInvestors generally enjoyed solid returns during the Trump presidency despite various surprise events such as the COVID-19 pandemic and the storming of the Capitol. Not to mention fresh tariffs on key trading partner China.\n\nThe Dow Jones Industrial Average returned 56% during the Trump presidency, according to data crunched by LPL Financial. The Dow notched 126 new highs.\n\nThe S&P 500 climbed more than 50%.\n\nApple's stock surged in excess of 350% during the Trump presidency, part of a broad rally in tech stocks.\n\nPros say the gains were fueled primarily by the Trump tax cuts boosting corporate profits and the wealth effect from stocks spurring consumer spending.\n\nBut those expecting sunshine and rainbows in a potential Trump presidency may want to dial back expectations, at least initially.\n\nWilson points out that the backdrop for stocks is much different from that of 2016.\n\nStory continues\n\n\"We would argue that the cycle is more mature today than it was in 2016, as evidenced (among other variables) by the two-and-a-half-year decline in the Conference Board Leading Economic Indicator series,\" Wilson said.\n\n\"The market welcomed a reflationary playbook in 2016. Inflation was not a headwind to consumers in the way it is now, and the US economy was recovering from a manufacturing/commodity recession, the recovery of which was aided by the prospects of a pro-fiscal/reflationary policy regime. Today, inflation is a notable headwind to consumers and fiscal sustainability dynamics are top of mind for the bond market.\"\n\nFord (F) CEO Jim Farley says consumers may get a little nervous around the presidential election but doesn't believe it will materially stunt demand for autos.

(Photo: Jim Allen/FreightWaves)\n\nA Baltimore UPS customer center is planning to close in August, according to a Maryland state filing. The move will affect hundreds of workers.\n\nA UPS (NYSE: UPS) on Vero Road will shutter Aug. 23, resulting in the layoffs of 540 employees, according to a Work Adjustment and Retraining Notification filed June 20 with the Maryland Department of Labor. The same UPS location laid off 118 employees in March.\n\nA representative from UPS sent this statement to FreightWaves, \u201cAs a part of our Network of the Future initiative we\u2019re modernizing our Baltimore facility at 3901 Vero Road and will temporarily close the facility on August 23, 2024. Our employees are extremely important to us, and we are working to place as many employees as possible in other positions at our onsite temporary hub or in nearby facilities. We remain committed to working with them throughout this transition and providing support. This temporary closure won\u2019t impact customer service and we have plans in place to continue servicing the Baltimore community. We expect the enhanced Baltimore facility to reopen in late 2025.\u201d\n\nUPS announced earlier this year plans to shutter up to 200 facilities over the next five years in a modernization push. The plan is expected to save $3 billion per year by 2028.\n\nThe company plans to replace a facility in Worcester, Massachusetts, about 47 miles from Boston, allowing the consolidation of four regional facilities. Similarly, UPS plans to modernize a facility in Albany, New York, to increase capacity, resulting in the closure of another site. UPS has closed at least 15 centers in Harrisburg, Pennsylvania.\n\nThe post UPS plans to close Baltimore facility, lay off 540 workers appeared first on FreightWaves.",

        "title": "Election issues you've raised that barely get a manifesto mention",
        "body": "The election issues you care about that manifestos barely mention\n\n22 hours ago By Kevin Peachey , BBC News Share\n\nGetty Shoplifting is one of the issues on which BBC audiences said they wanted more detail from parties\n\nKey issues such as the NHS, the economy and immigration have dominated this election campaign. They are well covered in all the parties' manifestos, but some other topics only get a few words, or none at all. The BBC's Your Voice, Your Vote project was an invitation to tell us what matters to you. Big subjects such as climate change and housing dominated your responses. The parties too have covered those big issues at length, and have responded to the questions asked by voters.\n\nBut there are other points you raised, albeit in smaller numbers, that barely get a mention in the manifestos. Here is a selection of them.\n\nGetty Images Local councils are primarily responsible for regulating fly-tipping\n\nLitter and fly-tipping\n\nYour Voice, Your Vote is not a scientific project, but it does allow you to have your say. These topics are far from the most common in your responses, but carry great strength of feeling. Diane from Worcestershire says litter and fly-tipping are at \"epidemic levels\" while Christine, 33, from Surrey is shocked by \"the sheer amount of rubbish everywhere\". Martin, 42, from Perthshire asks: \"What are the parties going to do to enforce the law and what new initiatives will be taken to improve this worrying situation? It appears no parties are interested.\"\n\nThe Conservatives do have a sentence in their manifesto with a proposal to make fly-tipping an offence which would carry a sanction of penalty points on a driving licence. When it spelled out this policy earlier in the campaign, opposition parties responded with claims that cases had been high but resulted in a low proportion of fines. Labour says fly-tippers will be forced to clean up their mess. There may be good reason why litter and fly-tipping are rarely mentioned. Local councils are primarily responsible for this area of policy, so they were more dominant during local elections earlier in the year.\n\nShoplifting\n\nAlthough surveys give slightly differing figures on shoplifting, cases are at, or near, the highest level seen for 20 years. The BBC has reported on vulnerable women and children being trafficked to the UK to shoplift for Eastern European crime groups. Retail worker Allan wrote to say he faced shoplifting and threatening behaviour on a daily basis.\n\nGetty Images Surveys suggest cases of shoplifting are about the worst they have been for 20 years\n\nAmanda in Bristol says shoplifting has become \"normalised\", but there are contrasting views on the best way to tackle such a crime. The parties do devote whole chapters of their manifestos to how they would deal with crime. However, there is little mention of shoplifting in particular, although Labour plans to introduce a specific offence of assaults on shopworkers.\n\nAssisted dying\n\nScotland, Jersey and the Isle of Man are all considering changing the law to let terminally ill people end their lives. Campaigner Dame Esther Rantzen wants Westminster MPs to vote on assisted dying too, while Liz Carr, a comedian, actress and disability rights campaigner, has been a vocal opponent. Views on both sides of the debate are clear from your comments. Lynne from Kent and Anne from Lancashire both ask whether the parties would put legalisation of assisted dying to a referendum, while Oliver, aged 29, from Bedfordshire says it is \"an important social issue\" which has not had an airing in this campaign. However, John from Devon says it would be \"nonsense\" to allow assisted dying in any form. Only the Greens suggest in their manifesto that a change in the law is needed. The Conservatives describe it as a \"matter of conscience\" - both they, and the Liberal Democrats, say it should go to a free vote in Parliament.\n\nIncome tax thresholds\n\n\"The main issue I'd like to see the parties wake up to is personal tax thresholds,\" says Elizabeth, aged 44, from Cambridgeshire. \"Keeping these frozen until 2028 is crippling hard working families and it\u2019s just not fair or right.\" Not everyone agrees with Elizabeth, with some people pointing out that tax rises would be necessary to improve essential public services. Tax thresholds mark the level of income at which different rates of income tax are paid. They have been frozen, when they would normally be expected to rise in line with prices.\n\nThis issue has been raised regularly during debates, interviews and in commentary, such as this piece by the BBC's economics editor, Faisal Islam, but less so in manifestos. Labour, the Liberal Democrats and the Conservatives will all keep the freeze for the next three years. Reform and the Workers Party of Britain say they would raise the starting income tax threshold to \u00a320,000 and \u00a321,200 respectively, although questions have been raised over how this would be funded. Tax bands differ in Scotland, and the SNP says it wants full devolution of tax powers.\n\nGetty Images Fox-hunting was banned in England and Wales in 2004 but some people feel more needs to be done\n\nHunting\n\nToni from Devon is among those saying: \"The ban on hunting needs to be strengthened.\" Fox-hunting has been a major issue in previous election campaigns, before and after it was banned in England and Wales by the Labour government in 2004. There is different legislation in Scotland, and it is still permitted in Northern Ireland.\n\nLabour and the Greens say they would ban trail hunting, which sees hounds and riders follow a pre-laid scent along an agreed route. The Conservatives and Labour want to ban the import of hunting trophies.\n\nHow Your Voice, Your Vote shaped our coverage",

        "title": "Student loans: Almost 1.8 million owe more than \u00a350,000",
        "body": "Almost 1.8m people owe \u00a350,000 or more in student debt\n\n21 hours ago By Harrison Jones , BBC News Share\n\nBBC The highest debt known to the Student Loan Company now stands at more than \u00a3250,000\n\nAlmost 1.8 million people are now in at least \u00a350,000 of UK student debt, data obtained by BBC News reveals. More than 61,000 have balances of above \u00a3100,000, figures from the Student Loans Company (SLC) also show, while another 50 people each owe upwards of \u00a3200,000. The statistics were released after a Freedom of Information (FOI) request for the number of loan holders with above average debts who are eligible to start repayments. The SLC previously said the average balance for loan holders in England when they start making repayments was less than \u00a345,000. New government data shows that amount has now risen to \u00a348,470. Balances can be significantly higher for those who study multiple or lengthy courses and often rise rapidly with interest. In 2023/24, some 2.8 million people in England made a student loan repayment, according to government figures released after the FOI response. That means only a small fraction of those repaying their balances are in more than \u00a3100,000 of debt - but the majority do owe more than \u00a350,000. It comes after the BBC revealed earlier this year that the highest UK student debt was more than \u00a3231,000. Around three months later, that figure has now hit \u00a3252,000. Tom Allingham, from website Save The Student, said such balances were \"alarming\" but were \u201cin no way indicative of the norm\u201d. Personal finance expert Martin Lewis told the BBC the debts should be seen more like a \"limited form of graduate tax\".\n\nSpeaking on Radio 4's Today programme, he explained: \"Student finance for the vast majority of students is not about what you owe, but what you earn - you repay 9% of everything above a threshold.\" For example, those on \"Plan 2 loans\" would pay 9% of everything earned over \u00a327,295. The National Union of Students (NUS) branded it \u201cridiculous\u201d that none of the main parties are offering \"reform\" of student finance in the election campaign. Debts are written off at the end of loan terms, regardless of how much is owed by that point. The terms are often 30 or 40 years, but depend on your course and start date. Heavily-indebted graduates have also spoken to BBC News about their concerns with the current system.\n\nTiti, a senior electrical engineer from Croydon who asked for his full name not to be used, saw his student debt - which stands at more than \u00a3128,200 - rise by \u00a3788.11 between 6 April and 6 June this year. \u201cNo matter how much I pay it is always increasing,\u201d he said, referencing the near 8% interest rate on accounts like his, which is driven by high inflation. The father-of-one, 43, told the BBC he feels it is impossible to pay back the balance in full following his four-year course at London South Bank University and two years studying for a Higher National Diploma. \u201cIt seems like a money-making avenue when you look at the (interest) rates applied to the loans,\u201d he said. Titi said he fears some people may be discouraged from higher education \u201cwhen they do the calculations\u201d and consider what they could earn without a degree.\n\nTiti Titi saw his student debt rise by \u00a3788.11 between 6 April and 6 June\n\nIt is more than 10 years since tuition fees were tripled in England. From 2017, fees have cost a maximum of \u00a39,250 per year across the UK, though in Scotland, Scottish students are charged a maximum of \u00a31,820 and in Northern Ireland, the current maximum tuition fee for full-time undergraduates is \u00a34,710. Many people who borrowed \"exceptional amounts\" on so-called \"Plan 2\" loans - which were introduced when fees were tripled - are unlikely to pay the full amount back, according to Ben Waltmann, from the Institute for Fiscal Studies. But Claire Callender, a professor of higher education policy and deputy director of the Centre for Global Higher Education, told the BBC that owing such high amounts is \"likely to have a negative impact on graduates' lives\".\n\nIt is not clear whether the largest debt now known to the SLC - of \u00a3252,000 - is on the same loan as the one revealed to be the highest in March, at \u00a3231,000. Nick Hillman, the director of the Higher Education Policy Institute, told the BBC he was \"most shocked\" by the number of people in more than \u00a3200,000 of student debt. He pointed out that the data suggests that fewer than 50 people owe at least \u00a310m between them. \"Clearly, at that level, the student loan system is not working well because these people will not pay it all back\", Mr Hillman said.\n\n'People will not pay it all back'\n\nIn its response to the FOI request, the SLC said people with higher than average balances \"may be in receipt of several student loan products\", including an Advanced Learner Loan for further education courses and funding for undergraduate courses, postgraduate Master\u2019s courses and postgraduate Doctoral courses. It said other factors behind high student debts could also include loan holders studying multiple or lengthier courses or holding more than one loan plan type. The company added that some students receive additional funding due to \"compelling personal reasons\". Despite being in more than \u00a3101,500 of debt, foundation year 2 doctor Abbie Tutt is pleased the system does not impact credit scores. But Dr Tutt - who posted a video on social media \"celebrating\" her balance passing \u00a3100,000 - is unhappy about how long she will be paying it off for. The 27-year-old says the debt is saddening when she compares it to that of older colleagues who paid their loans off when terms were more favourable.\n\nAbbie Tutt Dr Abbie Tutt says comparing her debt with that of older colleagues who have paid it off is saddening\n\nShe characterises her debt as a tax. Dr Tutt told the BBC: \u201cIf you\u2019re going to uni because it\u2019s your passion and you are going to get a good job and be happy then you could justify it. \u201cBut I am not comfortable with people being in that much debt and not getting a job.\u201d\n\n'Ridiculous'",

        "body": "How Microsoft and Nvidia bet correctly to leapfrog Apple\n\n6 hours ago By Zoe Kleinman , Technology editor Share\n\nGetty Images Under Jensen Huang's leadership Nvidia has seen its share price soar\n\nLife comes at you fast. Last month, AI chip giant Nvidia briefly became the world\u2019s richest company, overtaking Microsoft, which had in turn risen above Apple. When this news was mentioned on stage at a tech industry event I attended in Copenhagen, there was spontaneous applause from the audience. As I write, Nvidia is now back in second place, after a fall in its share price took its combined value down to $3tn (\u00a32.4tn) compared with $3.4tn for Microsoft. Two things have propelled these two US tech titans to such a dizzying pinnacle: AI and foresight. Microsoft started investing in OpenAI, the creator of popular AI chatbot ChatGPT, back in 2019. Meanwhile, Nvidia boss Jensen Huang pushed his company towards AI chip development many years before generative AI exploded onto the scene. Both firms took a long-term bet on the current AI boom \u2013 and so far, it\u2019s paid off, leaving former top-dog Apple trailing in their wake. But how long will it last?\n\nThis year\u2019s London Tech Week, an annual event for the UK tech scene, may as well have been called London AI Week. The letters AI were emblazoned on every stand, and uttered in every speech. I bumped into Anne Boden, the founder of Starling Bank, a significant fintech disruptor. She was buzzing with excitement. \u201cWe thought we knew who the winners and losers were [in tech],\u201d she told me. \u201cBut with AI, we are throwing the dice again\u201d. She believes she\u2019s watching the AI revolution re-landscape the tech sector, and she wants to dive back in. That same week I also popped along to Founders Forum, an annual gathering of around 250 high-level entrepreneurs and investors. Some serious money, in other words. It\u2019s a confidential event, but I don\u2019t think I\u2019ll get into too much trouble for saying that much of the chat there was also centred around AI. A few days after that, a headline in the Financial Times caught my eye. \u201cMost stocks hyped as winners from AI boom have fallen this year,\u201d it read, claiming that more than half of the stocks in Citigroup\u2019s \u201cAI winners basket\u201d had fallen in value in 2024. Life comes at you fast indeed.\n\nGetty Images Anne Boden says that AI has completely shaken up the tech sector\n\n\u201cGiven how high valuations have leapt for tech companies, missteps ahead could cause big wobbles in share prices,\u201d warns Susannah Streeter, head of money and markets at the investment firm Hargreaves Lansdown. \u201cJust like the dot.com bubble, over-enthusiasm risks spilling over into disappointment.\u201d In 2023 you\u2019d have been forgiven for thinking that anything with the acronym AI in it was guaranteed to open up a lucrative seam of funding, with investment dollars flooding into all things AI. My friend Saurabh Dayal, who is based in Scotland, identifies AI projects for his investment firm to potentially collaborate on. He said he soon grew tired of misleading pitches. \u201cI spend a lot of time saying \u2018\u2026 but that\u2019s not AI\u2019,\u201d he tells me. It seems both investors and clients are finally growing wiser to the term AI, and, as a result, more picky.\n\nSpeaking to the FT, Citi\u2019s Stuart Kaiser said that while AI remained a big theme in the world of stocks and shares, \u201cjust saying AI 15 times isn\u2019t going to cut it anymore\u201d. In addition, there is increased awareness of current generative AI products not exactly living up to their own hype. Inaccuracies, misinformation, displays of bias, copyright infringements and some content that\u2019s just plain weird. And early AI-enabled physical devices like the Rabbit R1 and Humane Pin have received bad reviews. \u201cWe\u2019re seeing the market around generative AI mature a little right now \u2013 early experiments set a lot of grand expectations, but when the rubber hit the road there were too many unexpected outcomes,\u201d says Chris Weston, chief digital and information officer of the tech service firm Jumar. \u201cBusinesses have a lot of value tied up in goodwill \u2013 the trust and comfort that their clients have in their services. Introducing ungovernable chatbots is a step too far for many right now.\u201d Tech analyst Paolo Pescatore agrees that the pressure is on for AI firms to deliver on their promises. \u201cThe bubble will burst the moment one of the giants fails to show any meaningful growth from AI,\u201d he says. But he does not believe that is going to happen any time soon. \u201cEveryone is still jostling for position, and all companies are pinning their strategies on AI,\u201d he adds. \u201cAll the players are ramping up their activities, increasing spend and claiming early successes.\u201d\n\nGetty Images ChatGPT is the AI app that has really caught the public's attention",

        "body": "Levelling up: Can the next government help the UK games industry?\n\n22 hours ago By Andrew Rogers and Tom Richardson , BBC Newsbeat Share\n\nBBC/Getty/PA Voters are due to select their favoured party on 4 July\n\nYou've heard politicians talking about tax, immigration and the economy, but there's one topic they don't tend to mention. Video games. The UK's games industry is globally respected, employs an estimated 76,000 people and is thought to bring \u00a36bn a year to the UK economy. It's also a sector in the middle of a crisis. Over the last 18 months thousands of workers worldwide have lost their jobs and studios have been shut down. Much of the focus has been on big names such as Microsoft and Sony, both of which have laid off hundreds of staff in 2024. But smaller studios are feeling the pinch too. \"It\u2019s not great and I think it\u2019s pretty obvious,\" says Greg Lee. \"Every industry is struggling right now. But investment is drying up, people don\u2019t want to take the risk right now. \"And a lot of studios are suffering heavily because of that.\" Greg's the founder of Team Terrible, makers of viral hit indie horror game The Baby in Yellow. Described as a \"Lovecraftian babysitting game\" it's been downloaded millions of times.\n\nTeam Terrible founder Greg Lee chose Dundee for the team's base\n\nSince then, Team Terrible has moved into an office on Dundee's waterfront - a hub for game developers. It grew out of 4J Studios, which found success developing Minecraft for mobiles and consoles. The Scottish city has a rich gaming heritage and - stop us if you've heard this one before - is the birthplace of Grand Theft Auto. Thanks to its reputation and earlier investment in its development scene, Greg says, Dundee's a great place to make games. \"It's a very, very small city, which means that all the game studios know each other very well,\" he says. \"So there's definitely much more feeling of community, at local events you'll pretty much meet the entire range of all studios here. \"And I think that's really important. So it's very easy to find new talent because you know most of the people in the city and it's a really, really good place to grow because there's people around to support you.\"\n\nTeam Terrible Don't have nightmares: The Baby in Yellow has been a runaway success for Team Terrible.\n\nAccording to industry trade body UK Interactive Entertainment (UKIE) there are more than 2,000 gaming businesses in Britain. Like Dundee, towns and cities such as Manchester, Guildford, Cambridge and Brighton are home to clusters of large and small games developers. Team Terrible staff Fergus Coyne and Jonathan Rodger say they've benefited from having other people in the industry close by. \"People nearby that share the same passion as you do, you're never feeling alone,\" says Jonathan, a Dundee native. \"You can talk to people about projects, you basically are fighting the same battles.\" Both studied in the city before finding jobs in gaming, and say having a community around them is a bonus. But Fergus, who's originally from Stirling, says the industry is a \"scary place\" at the moment, and believes more could be done to help developers. \"As of now, gaming's still not recognised as its own sector,\" he says. \"It's lumped in with the screen industry, which includes film and TV. \"So having it not recognised in its entirety doesn't really bode well for us feeling like we're being represented. \"There's more talking happening, but there's still been no concrete information coming through.\"\n\nFergus and Jonathan say more needs to be done for the gaming industry to feel represented\n\nHow can MPs help the games industry?\n\nBoth Labour and the Conservatives mention gaming in their manifesto plans for economic growth, but with no specific policies. The SNP and Lib Dems say they want to rejoin the EU\u2019s Creative Europe scheme that could provide funding for studios. Greg says that he'd like to see politicians engage more with the games industry to go beyond a \"cookie cutter solution\". \"I think more investigation needs to be put in to see what individual studios need at different scales,\" he says. He believes the UK's setup for supporting games companies is \"antiquated\" compared with countries such as Canada, and says he's seen a \"brain drain\" of talented people moving abroad where wages are higher. \"I think in order to reverse that we need to change policy to encourage students to set up here to give opportunities to bring back some of those developers to the UK,\" he says.\n\nRockstar Games Grand Theft Auto was first developed in Dundee\n\nDespite gaming becoming a bigger part of people's lives, UKIE CEO Nick Poole says, it's \"still getting relatively little airplay within the the national political dialogue\". He says it's important for the UK to be \"at the forefront\" of the changing landscape \"We have a new Hollywood right on our shores,\" he says. \"The video game industry is global, the UK has an amazing heritage in that industry, we want it to have a really, really bright future in the industry as well. \"And so we need government to demonstrate that they care about the success of the UK video game sector.\" Nick says UKIE wants parties to support developers through tax reliefs, introduce a \"digital creativity GCSE\" and for the next government to increase investment in the gaming sector. Like Greg, he wants to see support that's tailored towards the industry, rather than mirroring schemes set up for other creative fields such as film and TV. \"We really want to sit down with them and work with them on solutions that genuinely work to scale up video games,\" he says. Nick says he's hopeful that a younger generation of MPs more in touch with gaming will be more receptive.\n\nWhat do the parties say?\n\nBBC Newsbeat approached the Conservatives, Labour, the Liberal Democrats and the SNP to ask for further detail on how they'd support the games industry. Thangam Debbonaire, Labour\u2019s shadow culture, media and sport secretary, said the party would \"focus on Britain\u2019s world class creative industries - like gaming - to create jobs and boost the economy\". \u201cWe\u2019ll open up education and cultural opportunities, accessible to all. We\u2019d bring in a new plan for creative industries and do an expert review on embedding creative learning in schools,\" she said. A Liberal Democrat spokesperson said: \"The UK's thriving video game industry makes a huge contribution to our economy and is responsible for thousands of good jobs, and we need to ensure it continues to go from strength to strength. \"The Liberal Democrats are calling for a proper industrial strategy to give our digital industries the support and certainty they need, and for serious investment in skills training so that more people are able to access opportunities in tech.\" The Conservatives and The SNP haven't yet added to what's in their manifestos.\n\nAllow Google YouTube content?

        "body": "Union calls off Port Talbot steel workers' strike\n\n2 days ago By Simon Jack and Faarea Masud , BBC Business Share\n\nGetty Images\n\nThe Unite union has called off a strike planned for 8 July so that further talks can take place over the future of the UK\u2019s largest steel works at Port Talbot in Wales. Owners Tata had been planning to shut one blast furnace at the site in September and one this Thursday, but then threatened to shut both this week due to safety fears over a staff walkout. Unite\u2019s strike action was called to the dismay of other unions who feared that it would accelerate the closures and hasten job losses. The Community and GMB unions had hoped that waiting until blast furnace four closed in September would give them time for more negotiations to extend its life, with a potentially new government in place.\n\nUnite general secretary Sharon Graham said the talks were \"essential\". \"Workers were simply not prepared to stand idly by while steel making ended and their communities were laid to waste,\" she said, saying the focus should be on fresh investment and the continuation of long-term steel making in the region.\n\nTata has been in talks with unions since January when it unveiled plans to radically transform its south Wales operations to deal with financial losses and to reduce its carbon emissions. With government help, the steel giant plans to build a new electric arc furnace that recycles scrap metal and is less energy intensive - a move it says will secure the future of steel making at the site. However, it would need far fewer staff and require the closure of the two existing furnaces at Port Talbot, resulting in 2,800 job losses. Extending the life of one of them would save 2,000 of those jobs if the remaining blast furnace was left on until the new electric arc furnace has been built on the site, which could take up to three years.\n\n'Dangerous game'\n\nUnite, which had pulled out of the talks, was already taking industrial action such as banning overtime and was due to stage an all-out strike from next Monday. However, last week Tata threatened to close both furnaces within days unless it could \"safely and stably operate\" them during the strike. It then wrote to all three unions, offering to begin new talks if the action was called off.\n\nOther unions have welcomed the news but have criticised Unite for giving Tata an excuse to shut the furnaces early. Sources familiar with the situation accused the union of \u201cplaying a very dangerous game of brinkmanship with everyone's jobs\u201d. But Unite officials rejected the claims, saying their action \u201chad helped focus minds\u201d. They are also claiming a victory of sorts over the news that further talks will take place after the election. However, in a letter to unions from Tata - seen by the BBC - it is clear the company had already agreed to further talks after the upcoming election.\n\n'Nothing but chaos'",

        "title": "High mortgage rates pricing out buyers, says Nationwide",
        "body": "High mortgage rates pricing out buyers, says Nationwide\n\n2 days ago By Nick Edser , Business reporter, BBC News Share\n\nGetty Images\n\nHigh mortgage rates mean affordability is still \"stretched\" for many home buyers, according to the Nationwide. The building society said that while earnings had been rising faster than house prices in recent years, this had not been enough to offset the impact of more expensive mortgages. Its comments came as it said house price growth had been \"broadly stable\" in June, with prices up 0.2% from the previous month. The average house price is now \u00a3266,064, the lender said.\n\nPrices were up 1.5% from a year earlier, but Nationwide said activity in the housing market had been \"broadly flat\" over the past 12 months, with transactions down by about 15% compared with 2019. The lender said the market was still being affected by the increase in mortgage rates, which started climbing after the Bank of England began to raise its key interest rate in late 2021. Robert Gardner, Nationwide's chief economist, said that mortgage rates are \"still well above the record lows prevailing in 2021 in the wake of the pandemic\". \"For example, the interest rate on a five-year fixed rate mortgage for a borrower with a 25% deposit was 1.3% in late 2021, but in recent months this has been nearer to 4.7%. \"As a result, housing affordability is still stretched.\" Nationwide's figures are based on the building society's own mortgage lending, which does not include buyers who purchase homes with cash, or buy-to-let deals. Cash buyers account for about a third of housing sales. The impact of higher borrowing costs can be seen in the fact that transactions involving a mortgage are down by nearly 25% over the past year, Nationwide said. Meanwhile the number of cash transactions for properties is about 5% higher than pre-pandemic levels. Across the UK, Northern Ireland saw the biggest price increases, up 4.1% from a year earlier. Wales and Scotland both saw a 1.4% annual rise. Prices in England climbed by 0.6%, with northern regions seeing bigger increases in general than the south.\n\nDespite some major lenders cutting their mortgage rates last week, home loan costs remain far higher than pre-pandemic levels. According to financial information service Moneyfacts, the average rate on a two-year fixed mortgage deal stands at 5.95%, while for a five-year deal the average is 5.53%. The focus is now on the Bank of England's Monetary Policy Committee (MPC), which sets interest rates, to see if it decides to cut at its next meeting on 1 August. June's MPC meeting saw a change in tone from policymakers, with suggestions that the Bank could vote for a rate cut next month. \"Buyers may find their mojo again when we get a rate cut from the Bank of England,\" said Sarah Coles, head of personal finance at Hargreaves Lansdown. \"This could come as early as August, although sticky services inflation and higher wages could mean we need to wait until the autumn. \"Either way, we\u2019re not expecting massive overnight drops in mortgage rates, so the reaction is more likely to be a muted upturn in sentiment than an overwhelming wave of optimism.\"\n\nLast week, the Bank said that about three million households are set to see their mortgage payments rise in the next two years. These are homeowners who arranged mortgage deals before the Bank started to lift rates in 2021. These deals are now expiring, and the Bank said the majority will finish before the end of 2026. For the typical household looking for a new deal, monthly mortgage repayments are forecast to increase by about \u00a3180, or about 28%, the Bank said. However, for around 400,000 households, monthly payments could jump by 50% or more. Bank of England figures released on Monday showed a small fall in the number of mortgages approved in May, down to 60,000 from 60,800 in April. However, the data also showed the amount borrowed through mortgages dropped sharply to \u00a31.2bn in May, from \u00a32.2bn the month before, although this does not include those remortgaging with the same lender.\n\nWays to make your mortgage more affordable",

        "title": "Energy price cap change mean lower bills but relief may be temporary",
        "body": "Energy prices fall but relief may be temporary\n\n2 days ago By Kevin Peachey , Cost of living correspondent Share\n\nGetty Images\n\nA drop in domestic gas and electricity prices has now taken effect, but costs are expected to rise again in October. Regulator Ofgem's new price cap for England, Wales and Scotland came into force on Monday, meaning a typical household's energy bill will fall by \u00a3122 a year. That brings down the bill for a household using a typical amount of gas and electricity to \u00a31,568 a year, the lowest for two years. But forecasters expect it to rise again in the run-up to winter, more than reversing the latest drop.\n\nLeading consultancy Cornwall Insight predicts that a typical household's annual bill will be back up to \u00a31,723 in October, a \u00a3155, or 10%, increase from now. \"Modest falls in summer look set to be wiped out by bigger rises in autumn when people will need to put the heating back on,\" said Adam Scorer, chief executive of charity National Energy Action. \"The cost of energy remains an unaffordable luxury that many of the poorest simply cannot afford.\" Although the price cap is changed every three months, it is illustrated by Ofgem in terms of an annual bill for a household using a typical amount of gas and electricity. People in larger properties will tend to pay more overall owing to higher energy usage, and those in smaller properties will pay less.\n\nThat is because the cap, set by Ofgem, limits the maximum price that can be charged for each unit of gas and electricity - not the total bill. It affects the gas and electricity bills of 28 million households, but does not impact customers in Northern Ireland, where the sector is regulated differently but where prices are also falling.\n\nEnergy bills are considerably lower than the peak after Russia's invasion of Ukraine, when the government stepped in to limit bill rises. That has fed through to falls in the general rate of rising prices, known as inflation. However, a typical household's energy bill remains about \u00a3400 higher than three years ago, prompting debate over the issue during the election campaign.\n\nIn addition, households have built up a collective debt to suppliers of about \u00a33bn owing, primarily, to the pressure from high prices. Those on prepayment meters, who tend to top up meters during the colder, darker months and are often under more financial pressure, will see a less immediate impact of a drop in prices in the summer. The vast majority of households pay by direct debit, and their payments are smoothed out over the year. They should have been contacted by their supplier about the latest price changes. Experts say it is a good idea to take a meter reading now, to ensure billpayers are charged at the correct rate. Ofgem is reviewing the way the price cap is calculated, including sifting through a host of responses to a consultation on standing charges.\n\nLatest changes in detail\n\nThe new prices that took effect for July to the end of September mean: Gas prices are now capped at 5.48p per kilowatt hour (kWh), and electricity at 22.36p per kWh\n\nA typical household uses 2,700 kWh of electricity a year, and 11,500 kWh of gas\n\nHouseholds on pre-payment meters pay slightly less than those on direct debit, with a typical bill of \u00a31,522\n\nThose who pay their bills every three months by cash or cheque pay more, with a typical bill of \u00a31,668\n\nStanding charges - a fixed daily charge covering the costs of connecting to a supply - are unchanged at 60p a day for electricity and 31p a day for gas, although they vary by region\n\nHow to keep energy use - and bills - down",

        "body": "Boeing to get 'sweetheart deal' - victims' lawyer\n\n2 days ago By Jo\u00e3o da Silva , Business reporter Share\n\nGetty Images A lawyer representing families of victims of two fatal Boeing 737 Max crashes says they \"strenuously object to this plea deal\"\n\nA lawyer representing victims of two fatal Boeing 737 Max crashes has told the BBC that the US government is preparing to offer the plane maker a \"sweetheart plea deal\". Paul Cassell, who says he got the information \"directly from the Justice Department\", added that the deal includes a small fine, three years of probation and independent safety audits. Boeing did not immediately reply to the BBC's request for comment, while the Justice Department (DoJ) declined to provide a statement. It comes as Boeing announced it had reached a deal to buy the aerospace supplier Spirit AeroSystems - a move it said would improve quality and safety. Spirit made the fuselage that suffered a mid-flight blowout on an Alaska Airlines 737 Max 9 jet in January, sparking widespread concern about standards at Boeing.\n\n'Families will object to this deal'\n\nLast month, US prosecutors recommended that the DoJ bring criminal charges against the plane maker. That was after the DoJ said Boeing had violated a 2021 settlement related to the crashes which killed 346 people. \"The memory of 346 innocents killed by Boeing demands more justice than this,\" said Mr Cassell, adding that the \"families will strenuously object to this plea deal\". The plane crashes - both involving Boeing's 737 Max aircraft - occurred within six months of each other. The crash involving Indonesia's Lion Air occurred in October 2018, followed by an Ethiopian Airlines flight in March 2019. Both crashes were linked to faulty flight control systems. A letter sent last month by Mr Cassell to the DoJ revealed that the families had been seeking prosecutions of Boeing's top executives at the time of the crashes and a fine of $24.8bn (\u00a319.6bn) for \"the deadliest corporate crime in US history\". The Justice Department has until 7 July to decide whether to revive a criminal charge of fraud brought against Boeing in 2021. That charge has lain dormant since the company acknowledged in a settlement that it had misled air-safety regulators about aspects of the 737 Max, and promised to create a new compliance system to detect and prevent further fraud. Under the deal reached in 2021, Boeing said it would pay a $2.5bn settlement and prosecutors agreed to ask the court to drop a criminal charge after three years if the company abided by certain stipulations set out in the deferred prosecution agreement. But in May, the DoJ said Boeing was in breach of the deal, stating that it had failed to \"design, implement, and enforce a compliance and ethics program to prevent and detect violations of the US fraud laws throughout its operations\".",

        "title": "Will Biden's green jobs policy help him win votes?",
        "body": "'Only latte liberals care about green energy round here'\n\n2 days ago By Michelle Fleury , North America Business correspondent Share\n\nBBC Qcells is investing billions in a solar panel factory in Georgia\n\nThe former \u201ccarpet capital of the world\u201d is getting a multi-billion-dollar makeover. Here in the rural Georgian town of Dalton, once known for its fabric floor coverings, a Korean company called Qcells is spending $2.5bn (\u00a32bn) to expand its solar panel factory, with another in the works. It's a bold initiative that will create 2,500 quality jobs in the next 12 months, in an area where the average household income is roughly 27% below the national average. It is hoped the project will revitalise a corner of the US whose glory days seemed over. And it's due in no small part to someone many of the residents of this Republican district would rather not credit - Joe Biden. The president's landmark 2022 Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) \u2013 his signature green legislation - offered hundreds of billions of dollars in tax incentives, credits and loans to stimulate American manufacturing in clean energy.\n\nThe most ambitious climate legislation in US history has generated a tsunami of private sector investments, with big implications for the rest of the world. And Georgia - a state President Biden hopes is in play in this year\u2019s presidential election - has been a big beneficiary. But with four months before the president goes head-to-head against Donald Trump, the billions of dollars of new investment in this key battleground state doesn\u2019t appear to have lifted the incumbent\u2019s support. President Biden\u2019s pitch is that solving the climate problem is also good for jobs. Since the law was passed, more than 300,000 clean energy jobs have been created in the US, according to the advocacy group Climate Power. And there's no doubt it\u2019s creating opportunities in places like Dalton. Here you see Bidenomics in action - foreign and government money being used to fight climate change and build an economy from the middle out.\n\nQcells' Scott Moskowitz points to the massive investments in US renewables\n\nScott Moskowitz, head of market strategy for Qcells, says that Georgia had been a great home since 2019, but that the IRA had been an \u201caccelerant\u201d. Without it, he muses, the current expansion might not have happened at all. \u201cWhat our industry has seen, since the IRA has passed, is more investment in the past two years in solar and clean energy manufacturing than the previous 20 years,\u201d he says. And yet that message either isn't getting through or simply isn't resonating with locals \u2013 not even local Democrats. Jan Pourquoi, the spokesperson for the local Whitfield County Democratic Party, tells me: \u201cIn the business community, there is a resentment against that company [Qcells].\u201d Mr Pourquoi, a Belgian expat should know. He owns one of the small carpet firms in town. We spoke in his office, overlooking the factory floor where they turn flooring remnants into small rugs. \u201cThe business community resents the fact that we have a company from South Korea coming in this area with government subsidies, while they themselves get nothing from the government,\u201d says Mr Pourquoi, who identified as a Republican before switching parties following Trump\u2019s election in 2016. He tells me that local voters know little about the IRA law. \u201cNobody cares about clean energy, not around here. That is the type of stuff that I would call the \u2018latte liberals\u2019 care about in the big city.\u201d\n\nQcells Qcells has been expanding its vast factory in Dalton\n\nWell, at least one person does, and that's Marjorie Taylor Greene, the firebrand Republican congressional representative for the district. She has touted Qcells' expansion, despite voting against the law that helped make it possible. It\u2019s creating some awkward dynamics for Republicans. The IRA is in Donald Trump\u2019s sights. If Republican lawmakers win big in the Congressional elections that are also taking place on 5 November, then portions of President Biden\u2019s signature climate law could be repealed, threatening a clean energy boom happening in their communities across the US. I sat down for coffee with Kasey Carpenter, Dalton\u2019s Republican member in the Georgia House of Representatives. We met at Oakwood Caf\u00e9, the bustling diner he owns along with a string of other local businesses, including a pizza joint and a boutique hotel. Mr Carpenter downplayed the potential impact on Qcells of manufacturing tax credits being rolled back. He doesn\u2019t think it would jeopardise the solar investments in his district. But he adds that if clean energy investments were to become at risk \u201cI\u2019m sure we\u2019ll be speaking with the Trump team\u201d. Our conversation ends with him saying it would be another feather in Dalton\u2019s cap if this carpet town could also lay claim to the title of \u201csolar panel capital of the world\u201d.\n\nBut that belongs to China, which controls 80% of the world\u2019s solar panel supply chain. For years China has been investing heavily in renewable energy, and is expected to spend a staggering $675bn in 2024, according to an International Energy Agency (IEA) report. To compete, governments around the world have begun throwing hundreds of billions at the green industries of the future. In the EU, investment in clean energy is set to increase to $370bn in 2024, according to the IEA. The predicted figure for the US is $315bn. US Trade Representative Katherine Tai said last year that she hoped the US\u2019s increased spending on renewable energy would help address the \u201csignificant distortion\u201d in the global economy caused by China.\n\nKasey Carpenter, a Republican, says he is not fearful that a possible Trump government would hit the solar sector",

        "body": "The big problem facing whoever wins the election\n\n3 days ago By Faisal Islam , @faisalislam, Economics editor Share\n\nGetty Images The former Honda site in Swindon will become a warehousing and logistics facility\n\nAmid a vast expanse of rubble, dust and noise, a green crane yanks away at a corrugated roof like a frustrated dentist attempting to extract a particularly stubborn wisdom tooth. Swindon\u2019s Honda factory - once one of the world\u2019s most advanced car factories - is being demolished, three decades after it opened. This used to be one of the fastest-growing towns in Europe. It was one of the jewels in the crown of investments attracted to the UK by Margaret Thatcher\u2019s brand of 1980s enterprise. Swindon voted for her, John Major, Tony Blair, David Cameron, Theresa May and Boris Johnson. It was also one of the first towns to declare for Brexit, by 55%. But last year, its council changed hands to Labour. The council has had to continue to accelerate cuts to local services, passing a budget with record cuts in order to stave off bankruptcy. Inflation, rising care expenses, and central government grant squeezes meant cuts to libraries, the Dial-a-Ride community transport service and dimmed street lights. There has been an almost 5% rise in council tax. The council leader has warned any further cuts will affect frontline services. What is happening in Swindon is a visible consequence of sluggish long-term economic growth. Government spending cuts, low private investment, deindustrialisation and shrinking disposable income have left scars even on what was one of the UK\u2019s famous boom towns.\n\nA view of shuttered shops on a Swindon street\n\nThe Honda site is set to become a warehousing and logistics facility. In another world, it would have been replaced by another major global manufacturer. Tesla, for example, was invited. Whereas five years ago the promise was to level up left-behind Northern towns, places like Swindon feel levelled down. The question about growth arising in this town is vital to whoever wins Thursday\u2019s election. Elsewhere in the world, sites like this are being repurposed for electric car manufacturing. The Americans are pouring public money into their factories to try to compete with China, who will soon be confirmed as the world\u2019s biggest car exporter. Emerging economies from Indonesia to Vietnam to Turkey are also investing in and growing their car industries. Indeed it was to Turkey that the entire Honda production line, including dozens of never-used industrial robots, was packed up and shipped off via the M4 and Bristol port last year. Swindon is not just about Honda. It is part of the M4 corridor where there are plenty of jobs in the knowledge sectors, and in finance, for example at the headquarters of Nationwide. The overall unemployment rate is just 2.6%, but the number of people not in work and not looking for work is 18%.\n\nFaisal Islam joined Gary Huett, who contacted the BBC as part of the Your Voice, Your Vote election project, for a bike ride around Swindon\n\nMarcus Kittridge, a former Honda engineer who now runs a cafe in the centre of town with his wife Tracey, accepts there are still \u201cgood employment prospects\u201d but says many are at or \u201c50p above\u201d minimum wage, and says this has contributed to a decline in disposable income in the centre of town. \u201cIt\u2019s like a Northern town that lost its industry in the 1970s,\u201d he tells me. They now shut the cafe at 14:00 every day because of the high price of energy. He expects to be passing on his rising costs in higher prices for the next year or two. They have also stopped selling smoothies, after a notable decline in the availability and quality of fresh fruit, which they blame on post-Brexit changes. \u201cWe were told the quality of food was going to go up after Brexit, I can tell you now it has not. I\u2019ve barely heard any politician mention it, but it definitely has had an impact on us,\u201d Tracey says. Might she have been a bit unlucky with her purchases of fresh produce? \u201cIf I\u2019m unlucky, I\u2019m getting unlucky every single day and I\u2019m probably the unluckiest person on earth,\u201d she says. Their experience shows that some of the undercurrents of sluggish long-term growth - high energy prices, low disposable income, low investment, and new trade barriers can combine in unusual ways.\n\nFormer Honda worker turned cafe-owner Marcus Kittridge\n\nGary Huett, a retired graphic designer also from Swindon who got in touch as part of the BBC's Your Voice, Your Vote project inviting you to tell us what matters, wanted to know why Swindon\u2019s town centre looked like it was \u201crotting\u201d and asked if anything could change. \u201cWe\u2019ve now got pound shops predominantly, and the thriving night scene, packed with the yuppy set in the 1980s and 1990s has gone and decayed.\u201d\n\nGary Huett wants to know why Swindon's town centre looks like it is \"rotting\"\n\nThe Conservatives say green shoots are already here. The latest growth figures for January to March show the UK now has the fastest growing economy in the G7 group of advanced economies, after last year\u2019s brief recession. Swindon\u2019s jobs record remains strong. On the Honda site, new investment has come, and the jobs, albeit in warehousing rather than manufacturing, will return. For Labour, Swindon - a bellwether town where residents have voted the same way as the eventual national winner for the last 40 years - shows that there are no quick fixes. They are not competing with the US or European Union (EU) with big public investments in green energy. Council spending remains unprotected and subject to the same ongoing squeeze. A looser planning regime might help build more houses or expand the solar farms that dot the countryside around the town. But the job of transformation is very real. When asked what will happen if the economy does not grow, Labour has responded by saying some variation of \u201cI\u2019m not defeatist\u201d or \u201cwe can do it\u201d. When I interviewed shadow chancellor Rachel Reeves in Swindon, I said that if she was relying on planning changes to transform growth prospects, they were going to have to be a revolutionary, almost Thatcher-style \"Big Bang\". She told me: \u201cIt\u2019s big reform we are offering\u2026 unless we grow the economy we\u2019re going to be stuck in a doom loop of low growth, high taxes and poor public services.\u201d Labour\u2019s hope is that there is a tsunami of private investment that has been held back from this country due to political and economic instability. That, the party says, can be unleashed by the tens of billions with a strong and stable pro-growth government.",

        "body": "M&S to launch clothing repairs service\n\n4 days ago By Liv McMahon , BBC News Share\n\nGetty Images\n\nMarks & Spencer is launching a new service for clothing repairs and alterations. From August, customers will be able to book through a dedicated online hub and have their fixed items posted back to them within seven to ten days. The work will be carried out by Deliveroo-style repairs start-up Sojo, and its in-house team of tailors, with prices starting at \u00a35. The move comes as retailers try to encourage more sustainable habits among their shoppers.\n\nSojo launched during the Covid-19 pandemic in 2021 with a mission to make repairing, not simply replacing, clothing more mainstream. M&S said its partnership with Sojo aimed to provide customers with ways to extend the life of their clothing. \u201cThrough the launch of our repair service, we\u2019re making it even easier for customers to give their clothes Another life, whether they are using our new repair service or long-standing clothes recycling scheme,\" said Richard Price, managing director of clothing & home at M&S.\n\nSojo's Josephine Philips wants to make repairing clothes more mainstream\n\nJosephine Philips, Sojo's founder and chief executive, said the partnership marked \"an incredibly big step\" towards its mission of making clothes repairs more accessible. Siobhan Gehin, a retail expert and senior partner at consulting firm Roland Berger, told the BBC that by partnering with smaller, independent repair firms, large brands can provide customers with convenient alterations without having to create the infrastructure for these services themselves.\n\nGrowing trend among retailers\n\nM&S is not alone in looking to repair services as a way to seemingly embrace and encourage sustainability. In January, Sojo took up a permanent space in Selfridges on London\u2019s Oxford Street to provide customers with access to its clothing repairs service. The central London department store also gives shoppers access to handbag and trainer restoration services. Japanese fashion retailer Uniqlo, perhaps best known for its viral shoulder bag, offers clothing repairs and additional services such as embroidery for Uniqlo items at six of its UK stores. John Lewis has made its fashion rental service and recycling scheme a key part of its consumer-facing sustainability strategy, alongside accepting and reselling pre-loved products such as electronics and furniture. High Street stores Primark and H&M provide customers with online guides for repairing and maintaining their clothes, such as how to sew buttons and zips on to items or rework them entirely. Primark has also held free repair workshops for customers across the UK and Europe since 2022.\n\n'Regulatory pressures'",

        "title": "Gareth Jenkins: Five key moments from Post Office inquiry",
        "body": "What we learned from IT expert at Post Office inquiry\n\n4 days ago Share\n\nBBC\n\nThe computer expert who helped build the faulty Horizon software has finally spoken under oath about his involvement in the Post Office scandal. Gareth Jenkins is a key figure, having appeared as an expert witness to defend Horizon in court cases, and is now at the centre of an alleged cover-up. His appearance at the inquiry was long-awaited after being postponed twice. He gave evidence over four days - the longest run of questions any witness has faced - and gave his version of events. Here are five key moments from his evidence.\n\n1. He thought Horizon bugs were fixed quickly\n\nGareth Jenkins referred to Horizon's overall reliability throughout his testimony, even challenging findings from the landmark Bates v Post Office case that identified issues with the IT system. He acknowledged \"individual problems\" affecting specific branches but asserted that, as a whole, the system was \"working well\". When questioned about bugs, Mr Jenkins admitted lacking personal knowledge of all known issues, stating he typically became involved when drafted in for problem resolution. When pressed on how he could provide court evidence without full oversight of existing problems, Mr Jenkins said: \"Bugs impacting accounts were rare. Monitoring was in place, and fixes were prompt. Therefore, live system problems were rare, making me confident in its operation.\" He claimed nobody from the Post Office alerted him to unknown issues, and he didn't actively seek information about bugs he wasn't involved in fixing. Mr Jenkins admitted not realising the need for comprehensive knowledge when giving evidence and \"with hindsight would have done things differently\".\n\n2. He was sent expert witness rules\n\nMr Jenkins was an \u201cexpert witness\u201d in several prosecutions brought by the Post Office. His duty was to the courts, not the Post Office or his employer Fujitsu. His role meant disclosing any relevant information about the Horizon software \u2013 even evidence that could help sub-postmasters' cases. Lawyers should have ensured that Mr Jenkins understood this. When asked about this by Mr Beer, Mr Jenkins stated that he didn\u2019t know about his responsibilities until the end of 2020. But Mr Beer showed him a letter from November 2005, written by lawyers working for the Post Office. The letter mentioned that he was an expert witness and, according to Mr Beer, listed his duties in an \u201ceasy-to-understand way\u201d. After initially denying he had received it, Mr Jenkins later accepted that it was sent to him. He said he had \u201cno recollection of having been briefed\u201d on his duties and had \u201cclearly forgotten\u201d about having seen the letter.\n\n3. He knew remote access was possible\n\nThe former \"distinguished engineer\" faced intense questioning regarding remote access \u2013 the ability of Fujitsu staff to modify sub-postmaster branch accounts without their knowledge. In his 2010 witness statement for Seema Misra's trial, he stated: \"No external systems can manipulate branch accounts without user awareness and authorisation.\" During the inquiry, Mr Jenkins accepted knowing that remote access was possible but believed it happened infrequently and left a visible trail. He based this view on \"informal chats\" with other Fujitsu IT staff. The former engineer told the inquiry that he only discovered the extent of unrestricted access Fujitsu technical staff had to sub-postmaster accounts during the 2018 High Court battle.\n\n4. He was a 'willing actor' for the Post Office\n\nIn 2005, Mr Jenkins was asked to provide a draft witness statement in the case of sub-postmaster Noel Thomas. The Post Office wanted his thoughts on how the losses could have occurred. One possibility, he said, was some sort of system failure. But the Post Office demanded changes, saying the line was potentially \u201cvery damaging\". It got deleted. The inquiry heard he was a \u201cwilling actor\u201d in this process. He said he was happy with the changes he ended up with as it still accurately reflected what had happened but used \u201cless emotive words\". The Post Office was applying the pressure, but he never checked with his own Fujitsu lawyers about signing off evidence that had been toned down. Earlier he was asked to explain attempts to \u201ctweak\u201d his statements, but Mr Jenkins believed this was more of a \u201ctidying up\u201d to make them easier to read. He said he pushed back when the changes went too far.\n\n5. He was 'better with systems than people'\n\nFour days of forensic questioning meant plenty of room for big revelations. It also meant Gareth Jenkins had nowhere to hide. It was very revealing about the character of the man who has been mentioned so many times at this inquiry. An IT specialist who spent his entire career at one company, by his own admission, he dealt \u201cbetter with systems than people\u201d. He would have been happiest engineering and designing, but found himself entangled in something very different. Something, he argues, he didn't fully understand. \"Can't you use the report I have already sent you?\" Mr Jenkins wrote to a Post Office lawyer in 2012. It is clear he was viewing the growing number of legal queries as a confusing frustration, taking him away from the tech front line. It is an annoyance that hasn't gone away. At one point, Mr Jenkins told the inquiry chair he wanted this \"over with\". Given the ongoing investigations, that seems unlikely.",

        "body": "Tata offers to meet unions if strike called off\n\n2 days ago By Huw Thomas , BBC Wales business correspondent Share\n\nGetty Images Unite workers are set to start striking on 8 July over Tata\u2019s plans to cut 2,800 UK jobs\n\nTata Steel has offered to meet unions for fresh talks on the condition strike action in south Wales is called off. In a letter to the UK Steel Committee, which represents the Community, Unite and the GMB unions, the company is believed to have offered to discuss future investment in Port Talbot. But the unions would be required to suspend future industrial action. Unite general secretary Sharon Graham told BBC Wales: \"They suspend closure, we suspend action.\"\n\nUnite workers are set to start striking on 8 July over Tata\u2019s plans to cut 2,800 UK jobs. The union wants the company to delay the closure of the heavy end of steel production in Port Talbot, which is due to happen by the end of September. Community and GMB have a mandate from their members for strike action but have not confirmed any dates, saying they would wait until after the general election before announcing their next moves. The offer to start fresh talks with the unions follows discussions between Tata and Unite in the days since announcing the proposal to bring forward the closures of both Port Talbot blast furnaces. On Thursday the company said it would close both furnaces this week unless it could \"safely and stably operate\" them during the strike. On Sunday it wrote to all three unions, offering to begin new talks if the strike was called off. The talks are not a renegotiation of the existing plan, but focus on future investment opportunities. Alun Davies, Community\u2019s national officer, said the letter \"simply reaffirms\" the position agreed by the unions and Tata at their last meeting on 22 May, and did not constitute a new agreement in response to Unite's actions. Unite had previously pulled away from multi-union talks, and was the only union to launch industrial action. Mr Davies said it was \"welcome\" Unite were \"reaffirming their commitment to the position they previously agreed\", that unions would agree on a memorandum of understanding before putting it to members to vote on.\n\nGetty Images Tata has previously said it is losing \u00a31m a day in Port Talbot",

        "body": "Asda and Tesco face legal action over E. coli cases\n\n5 days ago By Lora Jones , Business reporter, BBC News Share\n\nGetty Images\n\nLawyers acting on behalf of two people who fell ill in an E. coli outbreak in the UK have started legal action against two leading supermarkets. Law firm Fieldfisher said on Friday it had issued letters of claim for breach of the Consumer Protection Act over own-brand sandwiches purchased in Tesco and Asda. The claims for compensation relate to a man from the South East and an 11-year-old girl in the North West. One person in England has died linked to the ongoing E. coli outbreak, the UK Health Security Agency said on Thursday, although they had underlying health conditions. The E. coli outbreak is thought to be caused by some supermarket sandwiches containing salad leaves. The large majority of cases reported so far developed symptoms before 4 June and the number of cases being reported is now falling, offering hope the outbreak may have ended. Several food manufacturers recalled some of their products as a precaution. The Food Standards Agency said lettuce is the likely source, based on tests.\n\nFieldfisher said the claim against Asda related to a young girl who contracted E. coli after eating an own-brand chicken salad sandwich from the supermarket. \"The girl, aged 11, developed the serious condition haemolytic uraemic syndrome (HUS), which attacks the kidneys and has been on dialysis for three weeks,\" it said. \"She was discharged home two days ago but could be at risk of permanent kidney damage. Her mother bought three of the sandwiches as part of an online delivery.\" An Asda spokesman said that it had not yet received any letter from Fieldfisher regarding these claims, but added: \"As soon as we do we will review the details of the claim as a matter of urgency.\" Harvinder Kaur, a director at Fieldfisher, told the PA News agency earlier on Friday that she had issued a separate letter to Tesco on behalf of a man from the South East. He was also hospitalised with E. coli symptoms after eating Tesco-branded sandwiches containing salad, the law firm claims. \"Luckily, this client did not go on to develop HUS and is now home, but for a time he was seriously ill,\" she said. \"Under the Act, companies producing food must ensure it is safe to eat. \"If it causes illness, it is a breach of their duty and those injured are eligible to claim compensation, not least to fund possible ongoing medical care.\" She added that the man was a \"regular shopper\" at Tesco, buying his lunch there most weekdays as it was very close to his work. The BBC understands Tesco has yet to receive the letter from Fieldfisher.\n\nHow do you treat E. coli and what are the symptoms?",

        "title": "Affordable home residents in Edinburgh hit by 450% gas price rise",
        "body": "Affordable home families hit by 450% gas price rise\n\n3 days ago By Angie Brown , BBC Scotland, Edinburgh and East reporter Share\n\nBBC Jakub Parulski, who lives with his wife and two young daughters, said they were in a 'horror story'\n\nResidents of affordable housing developments in Edinburgh have said they are \"living in a horror story\" after being hit with a massive rise in their gas bill as costs are beginning to fall across the rest of the country. The Harvester's Way development has 180 properties which are all connected to a district heating system, where one huge gas boiler provides heating and hot water to all the homes. It is billed as a greener and more efficient way to heat their homes but it also means residents are unable to shop around for the best prices. Places For People Scotland, which operates about 1,000 homes across five sites in Edinburgh, has told residents the tariff for gas will jump 450% from 1 August, meaning people in a two-bedroom flat could be paying as much as \u00a3400 a month. It said the new heat tariff was procured at the end of last year and reflected the market conditions at the time. The unit price for gas can vary significantly and energy companies also impose standing charges, but the average UK unit price is currently just above 7p per kWh. The Harvester's Way residents were paying 4p/kWh but that is increasing to 22.18p/kWh.\n\nSome of the residents from People For Places developments in Edinburgh who say they cannot pay their new gas bill prices\n\nJakub Parulski, who lives on the development with his wife Kasia and two young daughters, said his monthly gas bill will rise from \u00a360 to \u00a3350. He said: \"These properties were aimed at affordable housing for low income families, this is not affordable by any means and we are very anxious about this. \"The problem is we can't boycott paying because we have pre-payment, pay-as-you go meters so they have us locked. \"We have no choice. The only choice we have is if we go cold with our small kids in the property.\" The low carbon heating and hot water district heat network has a smart valve in each home linking payments to access to heating and hot water. As long as their account is in credit, the valve will remain open and they have access to heating and hot water. If an account runs out of credit, the valve closes until a top-up payment is made. Mr Parulski said he would not be able to sell his house because no-one would buy a property with such a high gas tariff. \"We are absolutely devastated. We are going to be locked in properties we cannot afford,\" he said. \"People will lose their homes. Some of us are looking at being homeless, some of us are nosediving into poverty. \"It is impossible now for us to sell our properties. We feel trapped and this is beginning to be a horror story and is no joke for a lot of us. \"It is really desperate.\"\n\nHenda Sankareh said she got the \"fright of her life\" at the new gas prices\n\nThe price rise was first introduced in April but delayed after residents complained. They told BBC Scotland the first they knew about their tariff changing was when credit in their pay-as-you-go meters suddenly dropped overnight. When Henda Sankareh noticed she had no hot water to wash her four-month-old baby at her rented flat on the Harvester's Way development she thought the boiler was broken. So the mother-of-two called the managers running the development to report the fault. But the 30-year-old said she got the \"fright of her life\" when they told her there was no problem with the heating and instead she had just run out of credit. She checked her meter and was shocked to see her monthly instalment had disappeared in less than a week. She said: \"They just told me the price had gone up so I needed to put more money in the meter. \"That's when I got into a panic. All the money had gone in just five days. I had had no notice or letter or email to warn me.\"\n\nScott Walker with his wife Samantha and daughter Molly\n\nAfter residents complained they had been given no warning Places for People Scotland launched an investigation. The company agreed to pay the higher tariff bill until the end of July but then residents would be locked into the new rates until the end of March 2025. In a letter to residents, it said: \"The procurement process requires us to adhere to terms and conditions known as the deed of conditions, which states we must get at least five cost quotes for price comparison before agreeing on a provider. \"Due to difficulties in finding gas suppliers for district heating, many providers chose not to participate.\" Scott Walker, 50, a quality control technician living on the Harvester's Way development, said: \"I got a fright and felt very angry when I did the figures in my head and realised this was impossible to pay. \"We can't afford to move. He added: \"When we bought this house we were told this heating system was really efficient. \"We need to try to reduce the tariff. Obviously it has to go up but not that kind of percentage. It's extortionate. We would take a normal price that everyone else pays. \"I want to get an independent review done of the heating system and how they have come to these figures.\"\n\nAngela Stevenson said she would fight the price rise",

        "title": "Tata steel: Strike could shut much of Port Talbot plant early",
        "body": "Strike may force Tata steel closures next week\n\n5 days ago By Mark Palmer , BBC News Share\n\nGetty Images The company had originally planned to shut down one of the blast furnaces by the end of June and the second by September\n\nWorkers at Tata Steel have been told the company is taking steps to potentially cease operations at much of the Port Talbot plant by 7 July because of a strike by the trade union Unite. The company had originally been planning to shut one of the blast furnaces by the end of June and the second one by September. But Port Talbot workers have been told that because of the strike from 8 July, the company can no longer be assured of sufficient resources being available to ensure safe and stable operations. The Unite union said Tata's statement to shut or pause the blast furnaces three months earlier than intended was the latest in a long line of threats and it would not deter them. The Welsh government said it cannot and will not support the closure of both blast furnaces.\n\nLast week the Unite union announced that about 1,500 workers would begin an indefinite strike on 8 July over the company's plans to cut thousands of jobs. Onay Kasab, the national lead for Unite, told Radio Wales Breakfast that the union was due to have a conversation with the company regarding safety during the strike. Mr Kasab denied if the union had given the company an opportunity to shut the site. \"What other option have we got when we are facing 2,800 job losses. We have said to Tata, again and again, 'wait for a general election, wait for a new Labour government'\" he said. Mr Kasab said the union have a letter from the company asking the union to wait until after the general election for discussions to take place. However, the company previously said it would not be changing course in Port Talbot, regardless of who wins the general election. About 2,800 Tata Steel workers will lose their jobs when the company closes both blast furnaces in Port Talbot by the end of September. At the time, the company said if the strike affected the safety or stability of its operations it would be \"forced\" to accelerate closure plans. A spokesperson for Tata said: \"Following the announcement by Unite union to unilaterally call strike action from 8 July, Tata Steel is unfortunately forced to commence legal action to challenge the validity of Unite's ballot. \"In the coming days, if we cannot be certain that we are able to continue to safely and stably operate our assets through the period of strike action, we will not have any choice but to pause or stop heavy end operations [including both blast furnaces] on the Port Talbot site. \"That is not a decision we would take lightly, and we recognise that it would prove extremely costly and disruptive throughout the supply chain, but the safety of people on or around our sites will always take priority over everything else.\" Tata said it is again calling on Unite to withdraw its industrial action and join Community and GMB unions in \"giving consideration\" to the company's proposal, which Tata said includes \"generous employee support packages, training and skills development\". It said it \"understands\" the impact the restructuring will have on many employees and contractors, but that it \"remains committed to a just transition\" and hopes for a \"long and sustainable future\" in the UK. The company plans to build a \u00a31.25bn electric arc furnace to produce steel in a way which is less polluting than traditional blast furnaces but requires fewer workers. Tata said the move would secure the future of steelmaking at the site and the UK government is contributing \u00a3500m towards the cost of the project. The plans for the site will see both furnaces shut down. Number five will go off by the end of next week as planned while four is due to go off by the end of September. Preparatory work to shut down five will begin by 1 July if the strike goes ahead. Other elements that will close include the harbour, sinter plant, ore yards and primary steelmaking.\n\nPA Media Unite union workers are protesting against Tata Steel's plans to cut 2,800 jobs\n\nSharon Graham, the Unite general secretary, said the union is \"fighting for the future of the steel industry\". She said Unite has secured \"serious investment\" from Labour to safeguard jobs. \"Tata putting out a statement to shut or pause its blast furnaces three months earlier than they intended to is the latest in a long line of threats that won't deter us. \"The Unite campaign is not about selling jobs, it's about securing the long-term future of steel making in this country for thousands of workers in Port Talbot and South Wales.\" Unite said it is calling on the \"real decision makers\" in Mumbai to realise that \"the investment secured will be good for the company and workers.\" GMB union said Tata must \"step back\" from this \"irreversible decision\" and instead \"safeguard steelmaking assets\". GMB national officer, Charlotte Brumpton-Childs, said that the upcoming general election could \"change so much\", and that GMB's next actions would be decided by its members. The Community union condemned Tata's \"unacceptable\" decision to bring forward the closure and said it continued to support the Labour Party's call for Tata not to make irreversible decisions before the general election.\n\nAnalysis by Ben Price, BBC Wales News\n\nDevelopments have escalated quickly in the past two weeks. Unite is one of three unions which represents steelworkers and it has so far been the most militant in its action in the face of significant job cuts across Tata\u2019s UK operations. Members are currently working to rule and there\u2019s a ban on any overtime. However, the decision to walk out indefinitely is an escalation which now potentially threatens the early closure of the UK\u2019s largest steelmaking operation in Port Talbot. Tata says it would have no option but to close if the strike goes ahead, but in the meantime the company has filed for an injunction at the High Court to try to prevent the strike happening. It suggests Unite\u2019s ballot on industrial action wasn\u2019t carried out properly. With the action due on 8 July, Tata will need a ruling quickly. The other unions, Community and GMB, say they\u2019ll wait until after the general election before deciding whether to strike too. But having spoken to a number of steelworkers in Port Talbot, the sense is that many don\u2019t want a strike which could cost them the current offer on the table from the company. What happens during the course of the next week could be crucial to the future of thousands of livelihoods, although Tata says no redundancies will be made until the end of September, regardless.\n\nWorkers and local people have protested about the closure plans\n\nFirst Minister Vaughan Gething described the news from Tata as \"extraordinary\" and urged the company to wait for the result of next week's general election. In a statement, Mr Gething said: \"The news that Tata could switch off blast furnaces four and five at Port Talbot next week is extraordinary and will cause huge anxiety for the workforce, their families and the community. \"The Welsh government cannot and will not support the closure of both blast furnaces\". He added that acting whilst the nation went to the polls did not help de-escalate matters. Samuel Kurtz, the Welsh Conservative shadow minister for economy and energy,said it was \"disappointing news that will cause additional distress to communities already dealing with enough as it is\". \"Tata have shown no goodwill to their workforce at what is an anxious time. \u201cThe Welsh Labour government have also only paid lip service to Tata's workforce, failing to contribute a penny to the transition board, and UK Labour's manifesto says nothing on what it would do differently to support Port Talbot's steelworkers,\" he added. Luke Fletcher, Plaid Cymru's economy spokesperson, said steel should be brought under the control of the next UK government, which Plaid believes will be led by Sir Keir Starmer. Mr Fletcher said: \"The time has come now for an incoming Labour government to put words into action on steel. \"Save our steel is no good as just a slogan, if we are going to save our steel, nationalisation needs to happen on day one.\"",

        "body": "More flights cancelled as Aer Lingus dispute continues\n\n5 days ago Share\n\nGetty Images Aer Lingus have now cancelled almost 400 flights\n\nAer Lingus has confirmed it is cancelling a further 122 flights up until 7 July due to the ongoing industrial action by pilots. The airline has now cancelled almost 400 flights as a result of an indefinite work-to-rule and strike action by pilots. The work-to-rule means not working over time or carrying out any other out-of-hours duties. An eight-hour strike from 05:00 -13:00 local time is planned for Saturday. Aer Lingus said that due to the \u201cindefinite nature\u201d of Irish Air Line Pilots' Association pilots\u2019 industrial action it \u201cmust cancel\u201d additional flights up to 7 July.\n\nRTE Dublin Airport on the first day of industrial action\n\nIrish broadcaster RT\u00c9 had reported that the recommendation for an additional strike was made by IALPA on Thursday. However, on Friday afternoon, Capt Mark Tighe, president of the union, said that Ireland's Labour Court has invited both parties in the dispute to return to them on Monday afternoon. \"We are in the process of discussing that and that of course would have relevance to whether or not we escalate the industrial action,\" he told Radio Ulster's Evening Extra programme. \"I\u2019m hoping now that they have noted the seriousness of the situation and that they\u2019ll be able to apply their considerable expertise.\" Talks between it and Aer Lingus to resolve the ongoing pay dispute broke down without a resolution on Thursday.\n\nSchool pupils 'slept on floor'\n\nA group of students and teachers from Shimna Integrated School in County Down who were retuning from a trip to Berlin had their flight home cancelled while they were in the airport. Teacher Luke McWatters, said that their 21:45 flight on Thursday was initially showing as delayed and then, more than two hours after the flight was initially due to take off, they were told it was cancelled. \u201cTrying to ring through to Aer Lingus I was on three different calls to three different agents who, every time I got to a certain way through said: \u2018Because you\u2019re a group we can\u2019t do anything for you -you have to contact group Aer Lingus who don\u2019t open until 9am\u2019.\u201d Mr McWatters told the BBC\u2019s Evening Extra programme that he felt they had been \u201cleft high and dry\u201d, with no offer of accommodation or food.\n\nLuke McWatters Luke McWatters said support from the airline \"fell short\" of what was expected\n\nHe said the group slept on the airport floor. Mr McWatters said they were offered an alternative flight on 1 July. \u201cAt that stage we made the call to try other airlines and split ourselves up as a group,\u201d he added. Half of the group travelled to Edinburgh, while the other half caught a flight to Poland, with both groups booked on flights back to Ireland on Friday. Mr McWatters said that the support for Aer Lingus had \u201cfallen very short of what you would expect from a major airline dealing with children\u201d. The BBC has contacted Aer Lingus for a response.\n\n'Reasonable pay claim'\n\nCapt Tighe said \"passengers are extremely dear to us as pilots. Management don\u2019t meet you, we do every day. \"We\u2019ve been left in a position where our pay is being eroded and all we\u2019re looking to do is maintain our pay.\" Speaking to BBC News NI's Good Morning Ulster programme on Friday, Capt Tighe said in an effort to resolve the dispute, the union had said it would accept less than an inflationary rise. \"We don\u2019t believe anybody should be getting less than inflation, but yesterday in an effort to resolve this, we said we would accept less than inflation.\" However, he added: \"We believe inflation is a very reasonable claim in this current time.\"\n\nPA Media IALPA President Capt Mark Tighe said the Labour Court has invited both sides to further discussions on Monday\n\nAdditional strike action?\n\nIALPA had recommended to trade union F\u00f3rsa that the additional strike should be longer than the action planned for Saturday, RT\u00c9 has reported. If sanctioned, F\u00f3rsa will have to give seven days\u2019 notice to Aer Lingus before pilots can stop work. Aer Lingus has described the potential of further strike action as \"entirely inappropriate given the request of the Labour Court this week that the dispute should not be escalated\". Donal Moriarty, Aer Lingus' chief corporate affairs officer, said the airline is \"willing to go back to the Labour Court on a formal joint referral basis\". He said Aer Lingus has encouraged IALPA and F\u00f3rsa to \"agree to this step\".\n\nHow many Aer Lingus flights have been cancelled?\n\nAll Aer Lingus UK regional flights, operated by Emerald Airlines, and Aer Lingus UK transatlantic flights to and from Manchester will operate as scheduled. A full list of cancelled flights can be found on the airline's website.\n\nHow much are Aer Lingus pilots paid?\n\nCo-pilots can start out at about \u20ac36,000 (\u00a330,400), with packages increasing based on actual flying hours. Irish broadcaster RT\u00c9 has reported a captain at the top of the scale can be paid about \u20ac287,000 (\u00a3242,000). Capt Mark Tighe explained on Thursday that this can take up to 26 years. There are differences for pilots depending on whether flights are short or long-haul.\n\nWhat do I do if my Aer Lingus flight is cancelled?",

        "body": "Fujitsu expert: I didn't think Horizon was a monster\n\n5 days ago By Tom Espiner , BBC business reporter Share\n\nBBC\n\nFormer Fujitsu engineer and Horizon expert Gareth Jenkins has said he didn't think the software was \"a monster\" and that he was \"trapped into doing things I shouldn't have done\". Speaking at an inquiry into the Horizon scandal, Mr Jenkins was accused by lawyer Flora Page of \"protecting\" it when he gave evidence as an expert witness between 2010 and 2013. Ms Page represents Horizon victims including former sub-postmaster Seema Misra, who Mr Jenkins gave evidence against in 2010. Ms Misra told the BBC the system was a monster which \"had blood on its hands, and so do the people who protect [it]\".\n\nBetween 1999 and 2015, the Post Office prosecuted hundreds of sub-postmasters on the strength of faulty Horizon data, with 700 convicted of offences such as theft and false accounting. Horizon falsely flagged discrepancies in accounts, with many sub-postmasters using their own savings to make good the imaginary shortfalls. The wrongful prosecutions, which have been called one of the biggest British miscarriages of justice, had a devastating effect on the lives of the sub-postmasters affected. They faced financial ruin and the loss of standing in their communities. Some sub-postmasters ended up taking their own lives after being pursued by the Post Office for supposed losses, including Martin Griffiths, whose widow was later paid in instalments by the Post Office for her silence, the inquiry heard in April.\n\nGiving his fourth day of evidence at the inquiry into the Horizon scandal, Mr Jenkins was questioned by Ms Page, a barrister who represented Horizon victims including Seema Misra. Ms Misra was pregnant with her second child when she was convicted of theft and sent to jail in 2010. She later told the BBC she would have killed herself had she not been pregnant at the time. In a charged atmosphere at the hearing, with Ms Misra sitting next to her, Ms Page accused Mr Jenkins of being a \"Fujitsu man\". She said Mr Jenkins \"knew the Misra trial was a test case for Horizon\". Ms Page alleged his role was to make sure Horizon had a \"clean bill of health\" and that he had \"tailored\" his evidence accordingly. \"My role was to tell the truth,\" Mr Jenkins said. \"I attempted to answer as best I could the questions I was asked\". Ms Page responded: \"Never mind whether a by-product of protecting the monster was that a woman was sent to jail\". Mr Jenkins said he was \"sorry for had happened to Mrs Misra\" but he felt that was down the to way that the Post Office had behaved and wasn't \"purely down to me\". \"I clearly got trapped into doing things I shouldn't have done, but that was not intentional on my behalf,\" he said.\n\nMr Jenkins was part of the Fujitsu team that developed the Horizon software, and part of his role was dealing with bugs in the system. Mr Jenkins has maintained throughout his evidence that he didn't understand his previous duties as an expert witness to tell the court about problems with Horizon, and that he didn't know that he shouldn't just narrowly answer questions about the technology. Under questioning at the inquiry on Friday, Mr Jenkins said: \"I appreciate that I got things very wrong, but it was done through ignorance rather than maliciousness\". He added that the Horizon system \"as a whole was working well\". Mr Jenkins is currently being investigated by the Metropolitan Police on suspicion of perjury - lying to a court, and perverting the course of justice. No criminal charges have been brought.",

        "title": "The fastest data in the world",
        "body": "The fastest data in the world\n\n1 day ago By Chris Baraniuk , Technology Reporter Share\n\nsurf Mission accomplished for Edwin Verheul (left) and Joachim Opdenakker\n\nIn February, deep inside a warehouse at Cern, the Swiss home of the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) \u2013 the world\u2019s biggest science experiment \u2013 two network engineers held their breath. And pressed a button. Suddenly, text on a black background flashed up on a screen in front of them. It had worked. \u201cThere was high-fiving involved,\u201d recalls Joachim Opdenakker at SURF, a Dutch IT association that works for educational and research institutions. \u201cIt was super-cool to see.\u201d He and his colleague Edwin Verheul had just set up a new data link between the LHC in Switzerland and data storage sites in The Netherlands. A data link that could reach speeds of 800 gigabits per second (Gbps) \u2013 or more than 11,000 times the average UK home broadband speed. The idea is to improve scientists\u2019 access to the results of LHC experiments. A subsequent test in March using special equipment on loan from Nokia proved the desired speeds were achievable. \u201cThis transponder that Nokia uses, it\u2019s like a celebrity,\u201d says Mr Verheul, explaining how the kit is booked up for use at various locations in advance. \u201cWe had limited time to do tests. If you have to postpone a week, then the transponder is gone.\u201d This amount of bandwidth, approaching one terabit per second, is extremely fast but some subsea cables are a few hundred times faster still \u2013 they use multiple fibre strands to achieve such speeds.\n\nNokia & Surf After its upgrade the Large Hadron Collider will produce five times as much data\n\nIn labs around the world, networking experts are coming up with fibre optic systems capable of pushing data around even more rapidly than this. They are reaching extraordinary speeds of many petabits per second (Pbps), or 300 million times the average UK home broadband connection. This is so fast that one can barely imagine how people will use such bandwidth in the future. But engineers are wasting no time in proving that it is possible. And they only want to go faster. The duplex cable (with cores that either send or receive) from Cern to data centres in The Netherlands is just shy of 1,650km (I,025 miles) long, snaking from Geneva to Paris, then Brussels, and finally Amsterdam. Part of the challenge in reaching 800 Gbps was in beaming pulses of light such a long way. \u201cDue to the distance, the power levels of that light decrease, so you have to amplify it at different locations,\u201d explains Mr Opdenakker. Every time one tiny subatomic particle smashes into another during experiments at the LHC, the impact generates staggering volumes of data \u2013 about one petabyte per second. That\u2019s enough to fill 220,000 DVDs. This is slimmed down for storage and study, but still requires hefty amounts of bandwidth. Plus, with an upgrade due by 2029, the LHC expects to produce even more scientific data than it does today. \u201cThe upgrade increases the number of collisions by at least a factor of five,\u201d says James Watt, senior vice president and general manager of optical networks at Nokia.\n\nA time when 800 Gbps seems slow may not be far away, however. In November, a team of researchers in Japan broke the world speed record for data transmission when they reached an astonishing 22.9 Pbps. That\u2019s enough bandwidth to supply every single person on the planet, and then a couple billion more, with a Netflix stream, says Chigo Okonkwo at Eindhoven University of Technology, who was involved in the work. In this case, a meaningless but huge stream of pseudorandom data was beamed over 13km of coiled fibre optic cable in a lab setting. Dr Okonkwo explains that the integrity of the data is analysed post-transfer to confirm it was sent as quickly as reported without accumulating too many errors. He also adds that the system he and colleagues used relied on multiple cores \u2013 a total of 19 cores inside one fibre cable. This is a new type of cable unlike the standard ones that connect many people\u2019s home to the internet.\n\nBut older fibre is expensive to dig up and replace. Extending its lifetime is useful, argues Wladek Forysiak at Aston University in the UK. He and colleagues have recently achieved speeds of around 402 terabits per second (Tbps) along a 50km-long optical fibre with just one core. That\u2019s about 5.7 million times faster than the average UK home broadband connection. \u201cI think it\u2019s a world best, we don\u2019t know of any results that are better than that,\u201d says Prof Forysiak. Their technique relies on using more wavelengths of light than usual when flashing data down an optical line. For this they use alternative forms of the electronic equipment that sends and receives signals over fibre optic cables but such a setup could be easier to install than replacing thousands of kilometres of the cable itself. Activities in the so-called metaverse might one day require extreme bandwidth, suggests Martin Creaner, director general of the World Broadband Association. His organisation expects home broadband connections to reach up to 50 Gbps by 2030. But reliability may be even more important than speed for some applications. \u201cFor remote robotic surgery across 3,000 miles\u2026 you absolutely do not want any scenario where the network goes down,\u201d says Mr Creaner. Dr Okonkwo adds that training AI will increasingly require moving huge datasets around. The faster this can be done, the better, he argues. And Ian Phillips, who works alongside Prof Forysiak, says bandwidth tends to find applications once it is available: \u201cHumanity finds a way of consuming it.\u201d\n\nTeleGeography Demand for bandwidth is growing surprisingly fast says Lane Burdette",

        "title": "What is 'AI washing' and why is it a problem?",
        "body": "What is 'AI washing' and why is it a problem?\n\n6 days ago By Emma Woollacott , Technology reporter Share\n\nGetty Images Amazon had to defend the use of AI technology in its physical grocery stores\n\nAmazon received critical headlines this year when reports questioned the \u201cJust Walk Out\u201d technology installed at many of its physical grocery stores. The AI-powered system enables customers at many of its Amazon Fresh and Amazon Go shops to simply pick their items, and then leave. The AI uses lots of sensors to work out what you have chosen. You then get automatically billed. However, back in April it was widely reported that rather than solely using AI, Just Walk Out needed around 1,000 workers in India to manually check almost three quarters of the transactions.\n\nAmazon was quick to claim that the reports were \u201cerroneous\u201d, and that staff in India were not reviewing video footage from all the shops. Instead it said that the Indian workers were simply reviewing the system. Amazon added that \u201cthis is no different than any other AI system that places a high value on accuracy, where human reviewers are common\u201d. Whatever the exact details of the Amazon case, it is a high-profile example of a new and growing question \u2013 whether companies are making over-inflated claims about their use of AI. It is a phenomenon that has been dubbed \u201cAI washing\u201d in reference to the environmental \"green washing\".\n\nBut first, a reminder of what exactly AI means. While there is no exact definition, AI allows computers to learn and solve problems. AI is able to do this after first being trained on huge amounts of information. The specific type of AI that has made all the headlines over the past few years is so-called \"generative AI\". This is AI that specialises in creating new content, be it having text conversations, or producing music or images. Chatbots like ChatGPT, Google's Gemini, and Microsoft's Copilot are popular examples of generative AI. When it comes to AI washing, there are several types. Some companies claim to use AI when they're actually using less-sophisticated computing, while others overstate the efficacy of their AI over existing techniques, or suggest that their AI solutions are fully operational when they are not. Meanwhile, other firms are simply bolting an AI chatbot onto their existing non-AI operating software. While only 10% of tech start-ups mentioned using AI in their pitches in 2022, this rose to more than a quarter in 2023, according to OpenOcean, a UK and Finland-based investment fund for new tech firms. It expects that figure to be more than a third this year. And, says OpenOcean team member Sri Ayangar, competition for funding and the desire to appear on the cutting edge have pushed some such companies to overstate their AI capabilities. \"Some founders seem to believe that if they don\u2019t mention AI in their pitch, this may put them at a disadvantage, regardless of the role it plays in their solution,\" says Mr Ayangar. \"And from our analysis, a significant disparity exists between companies claiming AI capabilities, and those demonstrating tangible AI-driven results.\"\n\nSri Ayangar Sri Ayangar says that some start-up bosses feel they just have to mention AI\n\nIt is a problem that has quietly existed for a number of years, according to data from another tech investment firm, MMC Ventures. In a 2019 study it found that 40% of new tech firms that described themselves as \"AI start-ups\" in fact used virtually no AI at all. \"The problem is the same today, plus a different problem,\" says Simon Menashy, general partner at MMC Ventures. He explains that \"cutting-edge AI capabilities\" are now available for every company to buy for the price of standard software. But that instead of building a whole AI system, he says many firms are simply popping a chatbot interface on top of a non-AI product.\n\nDouglas Dick, UK head of emerging technology risk at accountancy giant KPMG, says the problem of AI washing is not helped by the fact there not a single agreed definition of AI. \"If I asked a room of people what their definition of AI is, they would all give a different answer,\u201d he says. \u201cThe term is used very broadly and loosely, without any clear point of reference. It is this ambiguity that is allowing AI washing to emerge. \"AI washing can have concerning impacts for businesses, from overpaying for technology and services to failing to meet operational objectives the AI was expected to help them achieve.\" Meanwhile, for investors it can make it harder to identify genuinely innovative companies. And, says Mr Ayangar: \"If consumers have unmet expectations from products that claim to offer advanced AI-driven solutions, this can erode trust in start-ups that are doing genuinely ground-breaking work.\"\n\nRegulators, in the US at least, are starting to take notice. Earlier this year, the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) said it was charging two investment advisory firms with making false and misleading statements about the extent of their use of AI. \"The firm stance taken by the SEC demonstrates a lack of leeway when it comes to AI washing, indicating that, at least in the US, we can expect more fines and sanctions down the line for those who violate the regulations,\" says Nick White, partner at international law firm Charles Russell Speechlys.\n\nNick White Nick White says that it is good to see US regulators clamping down on the problem",

        "body": "Pro-EU demonstrators protest outside Parliament against Brexit on the fourth anniversary of Britain's official departure from the European Union in London, United Kingdom on January 31, 2024. Future Publishing | Getty Images\n\nIt's been eight years since just under 52% of the British electorate voted to leave the European Union, in a monumental decision that divided friends, families and the nation. It still does, to a lesser extent, with polls suggesting that the same vote held now might produce a different result and constituents questioning whether life outside the economic and political union is really better. Still, \"we are where we are\" is the attitude of many Britons, with parties of all political colors vowing in the years between the referendum and the actual January 2020 exit, to \"make the best of it.\" But if Labour \u2014 a party which opposed Brexit but pledged to \"respect the will of the British people\" \u2014 wins the forthcoming U.K. election on July 4 as polls suggest, some analysts predicting a thawing of icy relations between the EU and U.K. and, perhaps, even a rapprochement. For its part, Labour is treading carefully around the thorny subject of Brexit and any post-election win relationship with the EU, eager not to scare the horses \u2014 that is, prospective swing voters \u2014 ahead of July 4. Instead, Labour says it will not attempt to rejoin the single market or customs union that characterize the EU's economic framework that facilitates trade between member states \u2014 but signals that it wants to improve relations with Brussels.\n\nWith Labour, Britain will stay outside of the EU. But to seize the opportunities ahead, we must make Brexit work. We will reset the relationship and seek to deepen ties with our European friends, neighbours and allies. That does not mean reopening the divisions of the past. There will be no return to the single market, the customs union, or freedom of movement Labour Party manifesto\n\nInstead, the party has said it wants to reduce trade restrictions and a new veterinary agreement to relax checks on agri-food goods (such as health certificates for products of animal origin, which require a veterinarian's signature). It also says it wants to reduce barriers for touring artists and musicians, and to secure a mutual recognition agreement for professional qualifications \"to help open up markets for UK service exporters.\"\n\nLorries arrive at the Port of Dover in Kent. Gareth Fuller - PA Images | PA Images | Getty Images\n\nLabour's reticence over making much of its potential post-election plan vis-a-vis the EU, the U.K.'s largest trading partner as a bloc, is largely seen to be down to its eagerness to target disaffected Conservative voters. Voter polls have consistently pointed to a significant win for the party, suggesting it could clinch around 40% of the vote, compared to 20% for the incumbent Conservative Party led by pro-Brexit Prime Minister Rishi Sunak. Around 16% of the vote is expected to go to the Reform UK Party helmed by Nigel Farage, a politician on the fringes of British politics who has never served as a Member of Parliament, but who was, arguably, the rocket fuel behind the Brexit vote.\n\nHard ball\n\nWhile Labour will look to improve relations with the EU if it wins the election, analysts say the bloc is hardly likely to fall over itself to make life more pleasant for the U.K. The EU has so far always stuck to its position that Britain would not be able to \"cherry pick\" the advantageous bits of its former EU membership that it would like to keep. After all, the EU has problems of its own, with a rise in hard-right governments and fractious intra and inter-EU relations as a result. In addition, it's tackling questions over its global economic position, undocumented immigration and war on its doorstep in Ukraine. \"We will have a U.K. government that will wish to change the relationship [with the EU], whether it will succeed is another matter,\" top U.K. polling expert John Curtice told CNBC. \"What they're wanting to do is to soften the relationship while still being outside any of the former institutions, and the question is to what extent the union will regard it is interested to accommodate that ... partly because they've got other things to worry about, and partly because they may just think: 'Well, you made your bed, you lie in it.'\" Nonetheless, Curtice held there was a shared interest in finding a joint strategy with regard to the high number of undocumented migrants continuing to come into Europe, and across the English Channel to the U.K. \"They might think it's in their interest to reach an agreement about what we do about migrants coming across the EU. Probably, as has been intimated in the past, only by us being willing to accept that we're going to have to be part of the European wide scheme that deals with the resettlement of migrants who come across the Mediterranean. There's going to be a quid pro quo,\" he said.\n\nLabour Party leader Sir Keir Starmer speaks ahead of the U.K.'s general election on July 4, 2024. Anthony Devlin | Getty Images News | Getty Images",

Royal Academy of Arts, London / David Parry\n\nLondon has long been home to some of the world's leading art galleries \u2014 Tate Modern, Somerset House and the National Gallery are among the U.K.'s most visited attractions. CNBC asked a mix of artists to name their favorite public and commercial galleries to visit in London \u2014 large or small.\n\nContemporary galleries \u2014 and an upscale hotel\n\nMultidisciplinary artist Lauren Baker, who is exhibiting at the Venice Biennale until November, named contemporary galleries \u2014 and a hotel \u2014 as her favorite places to see art in London. \"Alice Black Gallery offers daring fine art with deeply conceptual works,\" she told CNBC via email. \"It's not all pretty, there's often some dark and strange pieces that get you contemplating the meaning of life,\" she said. The gallery is in London's Soho and represents artists such as Rachael Louise Bailey, who works in a variety of mediums including sculpture, and abstract artist Matthew Harris. Baker also likes Woolff Gallery in Fitzrovia, describing its collection as joyful. \"With a real focus on texture and tactile works and many sculptural elements, the works are fun and colorful, and you just want to touch everything,\" she said. The gallery represents artists including Apolline Bokkerink, whose work focuses on snowscapes and forests, and Joanne Tinker, who repurposes candy wrappers, discarded foils and champagne cork cages in her work.\n\nClaridge's hotel in London opened its ArtSpace gallery in 2021. Artist Lauren Baker likes to take tea at the hotel after seeing an exhibition \u2014 Claridge's is known for its Foyer & Reading Room, where afternoon tea is served. Jeff Greenberg | Universal Images Group | Getty Images\n\nUpscale Mayfair hotel Claridge's opened its ArtSpace gallery in 2021, and Baker likes to visit it for its \"cool art crowd\" in the evening, or goes during the day and takes tea afterward. The gallery has its own caf\u00e9, or visitors can head to the hotel's grand Foyer and Reading Room for traditional afternoon tea. Artist and costume designer Machine Dazzle (born Matthew Flower), likes east London contemporary galleries Amanda Wilkinson \u2014 for its \"impeccable\" taste \u2014 and Maureen Paley, which has shown work from the likes of Turner Prize winning artists Gillian Wearing and Wolfgang Tillmans. He also recommends Fitzrovia gallery Niru Ratnam for its \"forward-thinking and intelligent exhibitions,\" he told CNBC by email.\n\nTate Galleries and Italian futurism\n\nLandscape painter Katharine Edwards, currently working on pieces inspired by the \"heat scorched\" vistas of Andalusia, Spain, will exhibit at Cricket Fine Art in London's Chelsea in September. Her top London galleries include the Royal Academy of Arts, for its \"wonderful\" exhibitions, she told CNBC by email. The gallery is showing its Summer Exhibition, which features more than 1,700 works chosen by seven Royal Academicians, some of which are available to purchase.\n\nArt handlers with Mark Rothko's painting \"Black On Maroon\" (1958), at London's Tate Modern. The gallery owns nine Rothko works. Rob Stothard | Getty Images\n\nEdwards also likes major London galleries Tate Modern and Tate Britain. \"One of my favourite rooms at the Tate Modern is the Mark Rothko room, showing Rothko's huge series of paintings which were made for the Seagram building in New York. They are almost architectural in structure with vibrating colour combinations. They are contemplative, meditative works which I find profoundly affecting,\" Edwards said. Multidisciplinary artist Komal Madar is also a fan of Tate Modern, and is looking forward to seeing its \"Expressionists: Kandinsky, Munter and The Blue Rider\" exhibition, which runs until October 20. In an email to CNBC, Komal recommended checking out the gallery's free exhibits too, including its vast turbine hall \u2014 the gallery is housed in a former power station. Madar also suggested feminist artist Judy Chicago's \"Revelations\" at Serpentine North in Hyde Park (running until September 1) and the White Cube galleries in London's Bermondsey and Mayfair areas. Edwards also picked the Estorick Collection, which displays futurist Italian art in an Islington town house. \"Futurism was a movement that came about in the early 1900s as a way for Italian artists (primarily) to express the energy of the modern world. There are Modigliani sculptures, incredible abstracts and rooms for rotating shows,\" Edwards told CNBC.\n\nA photographer's favorites\n\nArtists Gilbert Proesch and George Passmore at their Gilbert & George Centre Gallery ahead of its opening in April 2023. Joe Maher | Getty Images\n\nLondon-based portrait photographer Tom Oldham has taken pictures of musicians such as Dave Grohl and sports stars including Usain Bolt, and his project The Hopefuls aims to encourage young people to vote in the U.K.'s general election on July 4. The Photographers' Gallery in Soho is a favorite for its \"powerful and edgy selections,\" Oldham told CNBC by email, and he recommended its bookshop and caf\u00e9. He also likes The Gilbert & George Centre, a free-to-enter gallery run by artist couple Gilbert Prousch and George Passmore, for its \"three vast rooms showing different works, young and old.\" Oldham suggested a drink afterward at neighboring pub the Pride of Spitalfields.\n\nGallery staff with a portrait of Queen Elizabeth II by artist Andy Warhol at Phillips auction house on June 1, 2022 in London, England.

        "title": "Nike Suffers Its Worst One-Day Plunge After Guidance Cut, But Shares Are Not A Buy Yet",
        "body": "Robert Way\n\nOn Thursday, Nike (NYSE:NKE) reported fourth-quarter fiscal 2024 earnings results after the market closed that were generally inline with lowered analyst expectations, but the stock sold off sharply after the company disclosed that first quarter revenues are to decline by 10%. What began as modest selling in the stock has snowballed to a 20% decline on Friday. The severity of the decline has upstaged Nike's previous worst day stock performance. I have a small long position in Nike, and I am reviewing it in light of the recent results. Nike is a strong brand and its stock price is headed to the discount rack, while I consider the selling to be overdone, the prospect of a prolonged turnaround leads me to expect that there are better ways for investors to deploy fresh capital at the present time.\n\nThe Good, the Bad and the Ugly\n\nRevenues and earnings for the fourth quarter that ended May 31st were $12.6 billion, down 2 percent on a reported basis and flat on a currency neutral basis. Net income came in at $1.5 billion, up 45% from the previous year's fourth quarter, with diluted earnings reported at $1.01/share or $0.17/share above analyst estimates.\n\nNike Q4 2024 Earnings Release (Nike Investor Relations)\n\nA bright spot was that SG&A costs were well contained in an inflationary environment, with gross margins expanding slightly from 43.6% to 44.7%. In addition, the company's buyback significantly reduced diluted shares outstanding from 1,556.3 million in Q4 2023 to 1,516.7 million by Q4 2024, a reduction of 2.54%. The share repurchase cost $4.3 billion over the fiscal year as part of an $18 billion four-year program authorized by the board of directors since June 2022. Shares were repurchased over the previous year at an average cost of approximately $103/share. Thus, a silver lining during the selling is that the remaining 2-year buyback will retire considerably more shares given the lower stock price.\n\nMoving on to \"the bad,\" I would characterize the company's failure to innovate in recent years as befitting this category. A recent piece in the WSJ highlights the waning interest of the running community with Nike products. Despite avid interest in road-running since the pandemic, Nike has been conspicuously absent from road demos. For a company built on the reputation of the legendary American runner Steve Prefontaine, the lack of execution is concerning.\n\nFollowing the pandemic, customers have been more engaged online than in brick and mortar stores, thus under performance of NIKE's digital brand was also concerning. On the earnings call, Matthew Friend, Nike's CFO reported that:\n\n\"NIKE Digital declined 10% in the quarter. Although our digital business has grown at an approximately 26% CAGR since fiscal 2019, we missed our Q4 plan on softer traffic, higher promotions, and lower sales of certain classic footwear franchises. More specifically, these franchises underperformed our overall digital business results in the quarter, especially in April and May, and continuing on into early June.\"\n\nMatt continued onto the ugly part of the call:\n\n\"Now turning to our first quarter, we expect first quarter revenue to be down approximately 10%. This reflects more aggressive actions in managing our classic footwear franchises, continuing challenges on NIKE Digital, muted wholesale order books with newness not yet at scale, a softer outlook in greater China, and a number of quarter-specific timing factors. We expect first quarter gross margins to be in line with the full-year guidance.\"\n\nThe call continued with the CFO identifying three major factors behind the 10% revenue decline:\n\nForeign Exchange: The strength of the US dollar on foreign exchange has had a 1% impact versus 90 days prior.\n\nThe strength of the US dollar on foreign exchange has had a 1% impact versus 90 days prior. Softening Economy in China: China accounts for $1.74 billion or 13.4% of Nike's revenues. The softening Chinese economy has materially harmed Nike's revenues.\n\nChina accounts for $1.74 billion or 13.4% of Nike's revenues. The softening Chinese economy has materially harmed Nike's revenues. Impact on Total Digital: The slowdown in digital was attributed as a major component of the remaining revenue decrease, along with \"key franchises across the total marketplace.\"\n\nIn total, the company expects revenue for the fiscal 2025 year to fall by \"mid-single digits,\" after earlier guiding for overall sales growth this year. Clearly the business has meaningfully slowed down in the past 90 days and the market was not pleased. The company has a catalyst in the 2024 Paris Olympics this summer; however, the damage has been done and 2024 will certainly be a turnaround year.\n\nValuing Nike by Discounted Cash Flow\n\nToday, it could be argued based on past growth and projections that Nike is becoming cheap, even with the prospect of an extended turnaround. This analysis depends on several factors, notably:\n\nProjected Revenue Growth: The model expects a \"single-digit\" decline in Nike's revenue from $51.22 billion at its peak in fiscal 2024 to $49.15 billion in the coming year and continuing after this year to $47.94 billion. Coming off an historical 11.0% 3-year revenue growth CAGR, the model projects a rebound to last year's peak revenues two years thereafter. As a margin of safety, I am making the assumption that the forecast revenue decline will not be a blip on the radar and will take an additional year to hit bottom and two years thereafter to return to growth.\n\nNet Balance Sheet Impact: Nike has a pristine balance sheet with little long-term debt and an AA- credit rating. The company has held leverage over the past 3 years at around 1.26x EBITDA, a low level evinced by the small 5.9% segment of debt in the overall capital structure.\n\nDiscount Rate: Interest rates remain elevated, and Nike's DCF valuation is dependent on the discount rate applied. The model assumes a cost of equity of 8.5%. Growth of 5% is assumed after peak revenue is reached until 2033, after which 3% growth is assumed. Expenses are assumed to scale with revenues (constant profit margins). This leads to a final mid-point valuation of $123.7 billion ($79/share).\n\nDCF Analysis of Nike (Excel)\n\nIn total, Nike appears to have some margin of safety after the recent share price decline, even with relatively pessimistic growth assumptions. Therefore, on a valuation basis, I am constructive on the stock.\n\nHowever, analyst expectations for growth still appear to be considerably above my expectations for the company. While analysts have reduced fiscal 2025 revenue forecasts to $49.15 billion, they are expected to rebound by fiscal 2026, hitting all-time high revenues of $52.32 billion. Revenue growth thereafter is projected to return to the high single digits. My gut tells me that Nike will take more than this length of time to reestablish record revenue.\n\nNike Revenue Growth Estimates (Seeking Alpha)\n\nGiven the challenges that Nike faces, I am not expecting a robust and immediate turn-around. With analysts still expecting growth just beyond the current fiscal year, buyers of the stock today will still be disappointed until Nike returns to robust growth. If the current analyst forecasts need to be reduced moving forward, it will tend toward pushing the stock price lower.\n\nReaders who agree with the analysts' expectations, should consider the stock to be a screaming buy at these prices, however, with the prospect of a prolonged turnaround, I am not planning to add to my small position, but will continue to watch the stock.\n\nConclusion\n\nSince CEO John Donahoe took the helm of Nike in January 2020, Nike made robust inroads into e-commerce that have stalled in recent quarters. Furthermore, execution in the company's core business has been subpar, with some analysts questioning if management is up to the task of navigating this turnaround.\n\nFollowing the disastrous earnings call this week, investors have the opportunity to purchase a wonderful company at a fair price, but I expect there is no hurry to do so as the company is in the midst of a painful turn-around. Buyers of Nike stock at the present time should have a very patient mindset.\n\nAs of this writing, the market capitalization of Nike is around $112.6 billion, putting the company at 2.19x sales of $51.36 billion and 19.75x earnings of $5.70 billion. While this is the very low end of valuation that has been available since 2012, it is a rather average valuation for the ten years before. Without growth, this is a fairly average valuation in today's market.\n\nTo take on the risk of a turnaround, I prefer very deep value and Nike is presently a hold rather than accumulate, but could become a buy if revenue growth returns at the present price or fundamentals do not become worse, but the stock trades lower into the high-sixty dollar range.\n\nNike Price to Sales and P/E since 2000 (Seeking Alpha)\n\nNike is a wonderful brand that I am confident will return to growth over time, however, investors and analysts are expecting high single digit revenue growth, while the company is guiding for mid-single digit revenue decline. Until this is resolved, I expect the stock to frustrate bulls for some time.",

        "title": "Will AI Be Coming For Your Job (Anytime Soon)?",
        "body": "alvarez/E+ via Getty Images\n\nBy Christopher Gannatti, CFA\n\nHave you ever heard the term \u201cLuddite\u201d? There were actually groups of people in England who destroyed machinery, particularly in cotton and woolen mills, from roughly 1811 to 1816.1\n\nWhy would they do this? They, like many of us, were afraid of change. There was a lot of longstanding employment in cotton and woolen mills, and these people were afraid that if machines took over these jobs, they\u2019d be abandoned by society, out of work and unable to provide for their families.\n\nThis paradigm can explain how many people may be looking at AI today.\n\nDid the ATM Replace or Augment the Bank Teller?\n\nA factory-oriented job is one thing, where a machine may very well be able to fully complete tasks like the process of weaving cotton and wool and dealing with it in different ways. These types of jobs have less \u201cgive and take\u201d human feedback inherent within them - the cotton is not expressing some sort of opinion about how things are going.\n\nA bank teller is different in that every interpersonal interaction could be an opportunity for both sides to learn something and seek a better outcome for both parties. Even if the majority of people prior to the ATM\u2019s introduction were simply withdrawing and depositing funds, one would never say that 100% of people were doing only this and never anything else.\n\nOnce people grew comfortable using the ATM, people parking their cars and coming into the branch was almost a signal that they needed something more, something that interacting with the ATM alone could not support. Many of these services were worth more to customers, and the bank could make incremental revenues by providing many of these higher-value added services.2\n\nSo, while machines obviated the need for as many workers on the cotton factory\u2019s floor, they actually created a need for more bank tellers to provide higher-value added services beyond withdrawing and depositing money.\n\nIs AI More like a Factory Machine or an ATM?\n\nThis is the quintessential question in that the focus really becomes full human replacement in certain roles or augmentation and a human pilot/AI copilot type of relationship. Microsoft (MSFT) was very purposeful with its Copilot branding of certain AI assistants, seeking to emphasize the added value coming from the person working with AI and not AI just doing everything without supervision.\n\nThe answer, most likely, will be a spectrum, with certain jobs looking like they could be closer to being \u201creplaced\u201d by AI and certain other jobs looking like they could be \u201chighly augmented\u201d by AI.\n\nThe Academic Framework\n\nWhen trying to predict what the future may look like in addressing these types of \u201csocial science\u201d questions, it can be difficult to structure the analysis in a way that allows for any sort of valuable insights.\n\nThe O*NET database covers 1,016 occupations and their detailed work activities and tasks. The key ingredient is that jobs are then broken into tasks, and tasks can be evaluated against whether it is perceived that they can be done in such a way with access to a large language model (LLM) that could lead to a roughly 50% time savings.\n\nIt is clear that some of this is subject to estimates and judgments, but it does take the rather complex universes of \u201cU.S. occupations\u201d and \u201cwhat LLMs can do\u201d and marries them in a way that allows at least some insights to be gleaned.3\n\nSome of the published work indicates:4\n\n8% of jobs could have more than half their tasks affected by LLMs with simple interfaces and general training. With current and future developments, this share could jump to more than 46% of jobs having, again, more than 50% of their tasks affected by LLMs.\n\nOn average, LLMs are relevant to approximately 14% of tasks per occupation.\n\nUsing National Employment Matrix data from the Bureau of Labor Statistics, it is estimated that about 80% of workers are in occupations with at least 10% of tasks exposed to LLMs, assuming partial implementation of complementary software.\n\nOnly about 1.86% of tasks can be fully automated by LLMs, plus additional software integrations, without any human oversight.\n\nThe two job clusters that appear most exposed to LLMs are \u201cScientists & Researchers\u201d and \u201cTechnologists,\u201d which could include software engineers and data scientists.\n\nSo far, the academic work appears to support \u201ccomplementarity\u201d and \u201caugmentation\u201d as opposed to \u201creplacement.\u201d\n\nExamining the Anecdotal Evidence\n\nPolitics and policy can be influenced by human stories as well as academic studies. There are some notable quotations talking about the potential for AI to increase productivity, particularly in the area of software development.5\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re now seeing that the developers using GitHub Copilot are 55% more productive on tasks.\u201d ~Scott Guthrie, Microsoft EVP of Cloud & AI\n\nOn Amazon\u2019s Code Whisperer: \u201cInternal tests showed 57% faster task completion and 27% higher likelihood of success.\u201d ~Adam Selipski, AWS CEO\n\nCoding is an interesting use case in that the various AI-assisted approaches may directly help with a process that used to involve a lot of internet searching and trial and error.\n\nAt WisdomTree, we don\u2019t yet hear of AI assistants getting things exactly right nearly 100% of the time - so those expecting perfection or close to it at this point would be doomed to disappointment - but it does allow for the honing of the process and greater levels of efficiency in getting through various roadblocks and challenges that may arise.\n\nWhat about Freelancers?\n\nCopywriting has been a notable and flexible freelance position that people take on, with practitioners typically building a client base within a particular industry. For instance, financial advisors frequently need lots of different marketing copy on their websites and in certain brochures and emails.\n\nIt doesn\u2019t make sense for them to write all of it themselves - their expertise is in working with clients on financial planning and related matters. Working with copywriters has been a longstanding solution, but it\u2019s easy to surmise that this type of job could be at a huge risk of being fully replaced by LLMs.\n\nIn 2024, it may be that the copy is not yet viewed as \u201cgood enough\u201d for the full replacement of human copywriters - with some stories of copywriters being asked to \u201cpolish up\u201d the work of LLMs - but it\u2019s important to keep in mind that models can iterate and improve quite quickly.\n\nIt also opens up an important part of the augmentation discussion. If a copywriter, coder or translator is only doing \u201cbasic\u201d work, LLMs may be able to do the full replacement of this work. The person would need to move up the curve, applying themselves to more advanced activities that the LLMs cannot complete as easily. However, there could be some learning or training required to get there.6\n\nConclusion: Change Will Be the Sole Constant\n\nThe spectrum will be an important mental model in that if people are waiting for LLMs to complete tasks in full with zero mistakes/hallucinations, they could be waiting a long time. However, if people are looking to improve their efficiencies in certain daily tasks, AI could be ready to help with that immediately.\n\nWe would do well to remember past innovations, like the calculator or computer, where we used to need people to be very good at doing math accurately, but in 2024, we have so many tools for that that it is far less important.\n\nIt\u2019s more important to understand the concepts embedded in math rather than do the arithmetic. AI is likely to be similar in that it will be less important for people to write words themselves, but it will be more important for people to understand the elements of a great story and how to edit AI outputs or prompt AI further and further in this direction.\n\n1Source: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Luddite\n\n2Source: Weiss et al., \u201cAI Index: Mapping the $4 Trillion Enterprise Impact,\u201d Morgan Stanley Research, 10/1/23.\n\n3Source: Eloundou et al., \u201cGPTs are GPTs: Labor market impact potential of LLMs.\u201d Science, Vol 384, Issue 6702, 6/21/24.\n\n4Source for bullets: Eloundou et al., 6/21/24.\n\n5Source for quotes: Parker et al., \u201cLeveraging AI to Drive Efficiency,\u201d Morgan Stanley Research, 2/27/24.\n\n6Source: Christopher Mims, \u201cAI Doesn\u2019t Kill Jobs?

        "title": "Veralto Corp. Stock: Growth Catalysts In Both Operating Segments (NYSE:VLTO)",
        "body": "Chris Rocco/iStock via Getty Images\n\nInvestment summary\n\nMy recommendation for Veralto (NYSE:VLTO) is a buy rating. As a leading player in the segments it competes in, VLTO is set to benefit from multiple growth tailwinds in the coming years. In the Water Quality segment, growing demand for semiconductors and the US government's focus on improving the country's water infrastructure are key growth catalysts. As for the Product Quality & Innovation segment, consumer preferences to know what is in their packaged food, consumer packaging goods companies need for traceability, and pharmaceutical companies efforts to combat counterfeiting are major growth catalysts.\n\nBusiness Overview\n\nVLTO\n\nVLTO is a leading global provider of technology solutions to monitor water and product quality. The business was a spin-off of Danaher back in September 2023. As of FY23, VLTO generated ~$5 billion in total sales, of which ~60% comes from Water Quality [WQ] and 40% from Product Quality & Innovation [PQI]. The WQ segment offers products and services for water analytics and differentiated water treatment solutions to help reduce the environmental impact of industrial activity across residential, commercial, and municipal applications. The PQI segment provides solutions for packaging and end-to-end product tracking that enable speed to market, as well as traceability and quality control across industries such as pharmaceuticals and food and beverage.\n\nStructural growth tailwinds for WQ segment\n\nVLTO's leading position in the WQ segment well positions it to benefit from the strong growth tailwinds in the US. North America makes up the majority of VLTO\u2019s WQ sales (55.7%). Within it, industrial and municipal are the largest growth verticals, and I see strong growth catalysts for both verticals.\n\nVLTO\n\nStarting with the industrial vertical, the CHIPS act as well as an increase in semiconductor production globally to be significant growth catalysts for VLTA as the production of semiconductors requires ultra-pure water. Although the semiconductor industry has been weak in recent history, I believe the long-term growth trend remains positive as the world demand for digital tools and solutions, AI, autonomous driving, etc. will only drive up the need for more semiconductors. I expect VLTO to be able to capture demand because of its leading brands in the industry (ChemTreat and Trojan). Brand reputation is important because customers are unlikely to take the risk of using a cheaper alternative that is less trustworthy, given that the cost of failure is massive. Put another way, given that ultra-pure water is a vital ingredient to achieve optimal yield results (for chip production), it is likely that customers are willing to pay more to ensure they can achieve optimal yield.\n\nAlso, the extremely sticky nature of the relationship between VLTO and customers is due to the mission-critical nature of having access to ultra-pure water. Customers usually have to buy replacement parts or consumables on a regular basis once they have the instrument to keep it in good working order. This gives VLTO a competitive edge since its customers are more likely to stick with VLTO brand's consumables because VLTO will not guarantee the product's quality if they use a component from a different brand.\n\nAs for the municipal vertical, the growth catalyst is increased US government funding to solve the country's water infrastructure problem. Indeed, the US government has stepped up on this. They recently announced another $5.8 billion in funding for America\u2019s clean water infrastructure plan. Additionally, the EPA also announced $3.2 billion of funding through the Drinking Water State Revolving Fund, bringing the total to $8.9 billion to assist in getting clean drinking water to Americans, which will be used to upgrade water treatment plants. This is a clear sign that the US government is putting priority on this matter, and I expect these fundings to be catalysts for VLTO sales.\n\nLooking ahead, I believe the US government is going to step up on the amount of funding because water utility systems have been underfunded for years, and based on the assessments by the EPA, over the next 20 years, the expected funding required is more than $1 trillion for drinking water and clean water infrastructure. Hence, the growth runway ahead for VLTO is visibly healthy, in my opinion.\n\nGrowth outlook for the PQI segment\n\nVLTO\n\nVLTO\n\nIn the PQI segment (my focus is on the marketing & coding [M&C] sub-segment, given that it has the largest revenue mix), VLTO is also a leading player. We know that VLTO is a trusted player in the industry, as it serves 85% of top CPG companies and 75% of top life science and pharma companies. This feat validates the trust placed in VLTO\u2019s brand. M&C is becoming increasingly important for consumer packaged goods [CPG] and pharmaceutical companies for multiple reasons, and they are growth drivers for VLTO.\n\nVLTO\n\nFor CPG companies, the VLTO M&C solution enables traceability (in case the product goes bad, the CPG company can trace it); helps comply with regulations; and protects the brand name in case of dispute (ingredient list, allergen information, etc.). I believe these two factors are going to become more important as there is an increased demand for healthier food (consumers also want to know what is going into their food). The near-term concern is that inflation is going to hurt CPG volume (which hurts demand for VLTO services) as consumers look to cut back on spending. The good news is that inflation has certainly come down from 2023 levels, and although it has remained sticky, CPG volumes have started to show stabilization or improvement.\n\nPWC\n\nFor pharmaceutical companies, the need to prevent counterfeiting and comply with regulations is a growth driver for VLTO in the foreseeable future. The former is the biggest problem, in my opinion, and that is driving more adoption of blister plastic films. This basically expands the VLTO use case (for instance, previously, codes were printed at the box level, but increasingly, prints are done at the blister pack level or pill level), which means more volume for VLTO. This also increases the complexity of the process, which means VLTO becomes more important in the process. In addition, like the CPG vertical, pharmaceutical companies are also subject to extensive regulatory scrutiny in regard to supply chain traceability, which I expect to be a permanent tailwind for VLTO.\n\nMany recognize that adding barcodes to exterior drug packages provides far less protection than encoding products at the blister pack or even pill level. Several also expressed frustration with the short shelf life of traditional anticounterfeiting systems. Report by PWC\n\nValuation\n\nRedfox Capital Ideas\n\nI model VLTO using a forward EBITDA approach, and using my assumptions, I believe VLTO is worth $107. While VLTO is a newly spun-off company, there are sufficient historical financials to rely on when forecasting the model (sales breakdown data available from FY13). Historically, VLTO has grown core sales (aka organic growth) at around ~4% on average (FY13 to FY19) pre-covid, and I am expecting VLTO to grow in line with this rate (CAGR basis). Growth could be higher, as the semiconductor industry growth outlook is certainly better today than it was a few years ago (for example, AI demand really only started to gain attention in recent years).\n\nVLTO also has a history of expanding margins (adj. EBITDA grows faster than sales), and I believe margins can continue to expand as VLTO wins more recurring sales (which have a lesser cost associated with them than acquiring a new deal). Using the historical rate of ~35bps expansion per year (adj EBITDA margin went from high teens in 2002 to mid-20s in 2022, which I assumed to be 17.5% and 25%, respectively), I believe VLTO can achieve ~26% adj EBITDA margin in FY26.\n\nThe closest competitor to VLTO is Xylem Inc., which is a pure-play water treatment company. Given that VLTO has a very similar growth profile (~mid-single-digits growth outlook) but a higher EBITDA margin profile, I believe VLTO should trade at a slight premium to Xylem (Xylem now trades at 18.5x). Plotting both companies forward EBITDA multiple charts side by side shows that they trade basically in line with each other. As such, I believe VLTO should continue to trade at the current 19.2x.\n\nVLTO\n\nVLTO\n\nRisk\n\nAlthough there are signs of volume recovering for CPG companies, the sticky inflation environment is still a risk. While inflation has come down, there is no saying that it will not go up again. Suppose it goes up, and the Fed raises rates again. This would put a lot more pressure on consumer spending, which will indirectly impact VLTO growth. For the WQ segment, a slowdown in regulation as it relates to water quality is an inherent risk to the VLTO growth outlook, and this is something that is out of VLTO hands.\n\nConclusion\n\nMy view for VLTO is a buy rating. The WQ segment benefits from strong tailwinds in the US, driven by the CHIPS Act and increased government spending on water infrastructure. The PQI segment, particularly the M&C sub-segment, benefits from growing consumer demand for transparency and stricter regulations in the CPG and pharmaceutical industries. Notably, VLTO has a good track record of organic growth and margin expansion, which instils confidence in forecasting the business outlook.",

        "title": "BuzzFeed: Loyal Users, AI Content, Debt Reduction From Complex Networks Sale (NASDAQ:BZFD)",
        "body": "Stockernumber2\n\nBuzzFeed, Inc. (NASDAQ:BZFD) is a digital media company known for its interesting blend of news, entertainment, lifestyle, and trendy content. The company\u2019s products cater to diverse audiences in a global and multilingual market, leveraging various revenue streams, such as native advertising, e-commerce through affiliate marketing, subscriptions for premium content, and content licensing to other outlets. After a challenging 2023, BZFD\u2019s investor letter highlights strategic moves like selling Complex Networks, cost-cutting measures, reallocating resources to key brands, and shifting from platform-dependent distribution to direct traffic to its own sites. This last change has generated a deeper user engagement and increased market presence. New investors are betting on its successful turnaround execution, which is never guaranteed. Still, I reckon several factors suggest a tangible recovery pathway. Thus, I lean bullish on BZFD for speculative investors.\n\nSocial Media Turnaround: Business Overview\n\nBuzzFeed is a digital media company founded in 2006 and based in New York. It went public on December 6, 2021, through a merger with a special purpose acquisition company [SPAC] that allowed it to be listed under its ticker BZFD. The company is known for its mix of news, showbiz, lifestyle, viral content, and a creative approach to Internet narrative.\n\nSource: BuzzFeed\u2019s Website.\n\nThe core operation includes content creation, news, and entertainment. In the content division, BZFD creates articles, videos, and social media posts for various audiences. The news division is a source of investigative journalism covering politics, technology, business, and social issues. Finally, the entertainment content comprises listicles, quizzes, and videos. Listicles are articles formatted as lists that are catchy and easy to read. The interactive quizzes allow users to reveal their personality traits and insights, providing fun and a self-discovery opportunity that is also shareable.\n\nMoreover, BZFD\u2019s short videos have precise elements that tend to trend on social media platforms such as Facebook, Instagram, YouTube, and TikTok. BZFD\u2019s content is relatable to a wide audience. It has developed a loyal base and a global presence in multiple languages and channels, allowing the company to expand its market and demographics. But more importantly, since BZFD\u2019s new strategy is to create \u201cloyal users\u201d rather than focus on casual site visitors, it\u2019s possible to steadily grow a faithful user base that can be monetized in several different ways.\n\nSource: BZFD\u2019s latest 10-Q report.\n\nConcretely, BZFD\u2019s users are monetized in its revenue streams: advertising, content, commerce, and others. Native advertising constitutes a primary source of revenue, while branded content includes sponsored articles, videos, and posts. BZFD also has e-commerce ventures that use affiliate marketing. In Q1 2024, advertising and content generated $21.4 million and $13.1 million in revenues, respectively.\n\nAdditionally, By partnering with large retailers and providing product recommendations, the company diversifies its income sources and enhances its relationship with its audience. BZFD also generates revenues through premium content subscriptions and licensing. For instance, its content to other media outlets like Meta (META) creates VR episodes of the show \u201cHot Ones\u201d for the Meta Quest platform. Also, Gravitas Ventures picked up BZFD\u2019s documentary \u201cBrother Orange\u201d for global distribution. Currently, the company continues exploring new revenue streams to feed expansion. I imagine these activities correspond to BZFD\u2019s \u201ccommerce and other\u201d segment, which generated $10.2 million in revenues in Q1 2024.\n\nOngoing Turnaround: Direct Traffic and Market Presence\n\nThe company was worth over $1 billion in 2021, but piling losses and declining revenues quickly eroded substantial shareholder value. Now, BZFD has resorted to selling assets to pay off the debt. BZFD\u2019s Q1 2024 Investor Letter highlights the company\u2019s strategic moves decided after a challenging Q4 and full year 2023. One of this turnaround\u2019s most pivotal moves is the sale of Complex Networks, a media company focused on youth culture. This sale has improved BZFD\u2019s liquidity and allowed it to pay some debt, significantly alleviating financial concerns. However, Complex Networks\u2019s sale is part of BZFD\u2019s broader turnaround efforts. This move enabled it to refocus on core assets like its websites and apps, high-margin programmatic advertising, affiliated commerce with big retailers like Amazon, Walmart, and Target, and AI-driven interactive content experiences to promote user attention and interaction.\n\nSource: BuzzFeed\u2019s Website.\n\nAccording to some reports, BuzzFeed is also trying to sell First We Feast, the media company producing the YouTube show \u201cHot Ones.\u201d The show features celebrities eating chicken wings while the host interviews them. BZFD would love to sell this for $70.0 million, but that might be too high as interested parties reportedly value it at about $50.0 million. This property likely contributes to the \u201ccontent\u201d segment, which generated roughly $13.1 million in Q1 2024. So, $70.0 million does seem high because I doubt \u201cHot Ones\u201d is the largest revenue vertical in that segment. But I would argue that even receiving $50.0 million seems like a good deal. This would allow BFDZ to pay some of its debts and refinance the rest. The letter also underscores implementing a cost-cutting plan by reducing central team sizes to make the company more efficient.\n\nTheoretically, sale proceeds will continue directly benefiting its brands as BZFD can refocus its efforts on higher-margin platforms. The company\u2019s sites include the flagship product, BuzzFeed.com, which has diverse and interesting content. BuzzFeed News itself focuses on investigative journalism and event coverage. Tasty is known for recipe videos that generate interest in kitchen gadgets and cookbooks, which can be monetized through commissions. HuffPost, formerly Huffington Post, was acquired by BZFD as well. First We Feast generates food-related content, and Nifty focuses on home improvement. Lastly, Goodful centered on wellness experiences, while Playful discusses family and parenting content. However, I suspect that while there might be some reallocation of resources as brand investment growth, most of the ongoing restructuring will likely go to refinancing purposes.\n\nStill, it\u2019s worth noting that the ongoing turnaround isn\u2019t just a refinancing move (i.e., selling assets to pay down and consolidate debts). Instead, BZFD\u2019s efforts include strategic changes, such as moving away from distribution on platforms like Facebook for increased \u201cloyal\u201d traffic. Instead, BZFD will now focus on creating traffic to its own websites and apps.\n\nSource: BuzzFeed, Inc. First Quarter 2024 Financial Results.\n\nSo far, this strategy seems fruitful. In Q1 2024, 90% of its audience\u2019s time was spent directly on BZFD\u2019s digital properties, encouraging deeper connections with its users. With this strategy, direct website and app users spend more time on the company\u2019s games and chatbots, increasing the company\u2019s market presence and user loyalty. These strategic decisions have strengthened BZFD\u2019s financial position, streamlined operations, and improved its core assets and user engagement priorities, enhancing its competitive edge in digital media.\n\nMoreover, in May 2024, Vivek Ramaswamy, the former American presidential candidate and entrepreneur, disclosed opening a position on BZFD, which he later increased to an 8.9% stake. This demonstrates a significant and active participation in the company\u2019s strategy. This new investor likely impacted the market\u2019s perception of BZFD, translating into a substantial stock price recovery.\n\nViable Turnaround: Valuation Analysis\n\nFrom a valuation perspective, BZFD remains a microcap stock, trading at a $101.0 million market cap. Its book value is $73.7 million, implying a reasonable P/B ratio of 1.4. For comparison, BZFD\u2019s sector median P/B multiple is 1.8, so the stock does seem relatively cheap. Moreover, the company has $44.5 million in cash and equivalents and $17.0 million in restricted cash, totaling $61.5 million in available short-term liquidity.\n\nExcerpt from BZFD's latest Cash Flow Statement. (Source: BZFD's latest 10-Q report.)\n\nI also estimate its latest quarterly cash burn was $16.7 million, which I consider the company\u2019s biggest problem. I obtained this figure by adding its quarterly CFOs and CAPEX, excluding the recent sale proceeds. This means BZFD burned $13.3 million in CFOs. I then added the reported CAPEX and also the capitalization of internal-use software, which is essentially CAPEX for a business like BZFD. These figures amount to a Q1 cash burn of $16.7 million. I exclude the $108.6 million cash inflows from the Complex Networks asset sale because it's a one-time item.\n\nHowever, management argues that the Complex Networks sale will save $23.0 million yearly in compensation costs. Moreover, the latest earnings call suggests revenue declines should begin stabilizing, as Q2 2024 guidance is for $44.0 million to $49.0 million in revenues. This would be a 21-30% year-over-year revenue decline (compared to Q2 2023) and represents quarter-over-quarter growth (compared to Q1 2024).\n\nSource: BZFD\u2019s latest 10-Q report.\n\nIf the $23.0 million in yearly savings materialize, it would reduce Q2 2024\u2019s EBIT losses by $5.8 million to roughly $15.9 million to $10.8 million. This is slightly less optimistic than management\u2019s Q2 2024 EBITDA guidance of $4.0 million in losses to positive EBITDA of $1.0 million. I imagine the difference is due to the cost savings being front-loaded in Q2 2024. Still, I think the likely scenario is that Q2 will also have negative EBITDA, as management\u2019s guidance seems optimistic if we simply look at the restructuring cost-savings and Q1\u2019s recent results.\n\nIt is challenging to estimate a cash burn figure for a restructuring company at its turnaround inflection point (the Complex Networks sale). However, I think BZFD is making the right moves. My $16.7 million quarterly cash burn estimate will likely decrease quickly due to four factors: 1) seasonality revenues pick up towards the fourth quarter of the year in BZFD, 2) $23.0 million in yearly cost-savings, 3) \u201cloyalty user\u201d and AI-driven content growth improving margins, and 4) the advertising revenues ramping up related to the US presidential elections into November 2024.\n\nSource: BZFD\u2019s latest 10-Q report.\n\nIn fact, if these four factors play out perfectly for BZFD, the company might even be cash flow positive in Q4 2024. Naturally, by Q1 2025, there would once again be a seasonal revenue dip. But this year is pivotal for BZFD because it has $100.4 million in convertible debt maturing by December 2026. So if BZFD can continue this trend and become cash-positive by 2026, it\u2019ll be in a great position to 1) use a likely higher stock price to issue equity and 2) refinance debt on more favorable terms.\n\nIt\u2019s a bold and risky plan, but I see a pathway for BZFD to become a debt-free, cash-positive company in the next few years. I think the upside is considerable at its current market cap of $101.0 million. After all, it\u2019s relatively undervalued just as its turnaround plan begins to bear fruit. Plus, if BZFD manages to sell \u201cHot Ones\u201d at a favorable price, I think the company would quickly handle its debts, reduce interest payments, and become debt-free and cash-positive. Hence, while BZFD\u2019s investment proposition hinges on its successful turnaround, there are plenty of good reasons to bet on it. Thus, I rate the stock as a \u201cstrong buy\u201d due to the substantial upside potential if BZFD achieves its turnaround objectives.\n\nInvestment Caveats: Risk Analysis\n\nNaturally, there are significant risks present when betting on a successful turnaround. BZFD is no different. Suppose the company fails to realize the $23.0 million in cost savings it announced, or its revenues continue to decline in tandem with its costs. In that case, the company might remain structurally unprofitable. If that happens, the rosy turnaround scenario I described earlier would vanish, and more importantly, it could hit the company\u2019s cash reserves significantly. Also, it\u2019s not guaranteed that BZFD will be able to capitalize on the secular tailwinds of the 2024 US elections. Indeed, I made assumptions in my \u201cstrong buy\u201d thesis. Still, I think the risks are justified because if BZFD succeeds, the upside could be significant at its current depressed valuation.\n\nSource: TradingView.\n\nAssuming the company\u2019s cash burn will continue decreasing quickly, its current cash reserves seem enough to withstand the turnaround period. However, if BZFD\u2019s cash burn endures or worsens, the shareholders will probably experience significant dilution and losses. Bankruptcy would be a severe risk if that happened.\n\nWorth the Risk: Conclusion\n\nUltimately, BZFD is indeed a risky investment at these levels. New investors are betting on its successful turnaround execution, which is never guaranteed. Still, I reckon several factors suggest a tangible recovery pathway. I believe management\u2019s strategic decisions have strengthened BZFD\u2019s financial stability, streamlined operations, and enhanced its competitive edge in the digital media. Since the stock already trades at a relatively depressed valuation, a successful turnaround that addresses BZFD\u2019s debt and cash burn should likely translate into significant upside for investors. Hence, I rate BZFD as a \u201cstrong buy\u201d for more speculative investors aware of the company's inherent risks.\n\nEditor's Note: This article covers one or more microcap stocks.
