        "body": "Democrat candidate, U.S. President Joe Biden, and Republican candidate, former U.S. President Donald Trump, attend a presidential debate in Atlanta, Georgia, U.S., June 27, 2024.\n\nDemocrats are making the rounds on the Sunday media circuit working to reshape perceptions about President Joe Biden after he delivered a stumbling debate performance that left his voters cringing and his party in a damage-control frenzy.\n\n\"Yes, it was a bad performance,\" South Carolina's Democratic Rep. Jim Clyburn, a close Biden ally, said on CNN's \"State of the Union.\" \"I know when I see what I call preparation overload. And that's exactly what was going on the other night.\"\n\nThe South Carolina Democrat followed the post-debate spin formula that has emerged from Biden supporters since the Thursday showdown: Acknowledge the fumble and then pivot to critiques of the presumptive Republican presidential nominee, former President Donald Trump.\n\n\"Joe Biden should continue to run on his record. I do believe that we will find him when contrasted with the record of the four years of Trump to be exactly what we need going forward,\" Clyburn said.\n\nFormer presidents Barack Obama and Bill Clinton followed that structure in similar arguments on Friday.\n\nHouse Democratic Leader Hakeem Jeffries, Sen. Chris Coons, D-Del., Sen. Raphael Warnock, D-Ga. and former House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., also jumped to Biden's defense on the Sunday media junket.\n\nDespite the full-court press, Biden's Thursday debate performance, marked by several instances where he tripped over his words or trailed off mid-answer, has only amplified voter concerns about his age and fitness to carry out a second presidential term.\n\nA new CBS News/YouGov poll taken between June 28 and June 29 found that 72% of registered voters surveyed do not think Biden should run for president, up from 63% in February. The poll also found that 72% of the respondents do not think that Biden has the mental and cognitive ability to serve as president, a seven percent increase since June 9.\n\nA poll taken so shortly after a major event like Thursday's debate represents a knee-jerk reaction. A more accurate snapshot of public sentiment may emerge as the initial hype dies down and voters have more time to process. The CBS News poll surveyed 1,130 registered voters and had a margin of error of +/- 4.2%.\n\nBut those new numbers come in direct tension with Biden's argument that voters are not as down on his debate blunders as much as political pundits.\n\n\"I understand the concern about the debate. I get it. I didn't have a great night. But here's what [is] not getting reported: Voters had a different reaction than the pundits,\" the president said at a Saturday campaign event in East Hampton, N.Y. \"Since the debate, polls show a little movement, and we've moved us up, actually.\"\n\nBiden and Trump are scheduled for a second debate on Sept. 10, though it is unclear whether both candidates will follow through.\n\nUltimately, the debate has triggered a Democratic reckoning over whether Biden should remain the presumptive nominee.\n\nSome Democratic strategists, along with newspaper editorial boards across the country have suggested he should step down and forfeit his delegates ahead of August's Democratic National Convention to allow someone else to take on Trump in November.\n\nBiden is at Camp David on Sunday, joined by his family where he is expected to discuss the path forward of his reelection bid, according to NBC News.\n\nIn the meantime, the Biden campaign has been raking in large fundraising hauls in the wake of the debate. As of Sunday morning, the campaign had raised $33 million since Thursday, $26 million of which came from grassroots donors, according to Biden campaign spokesperson Kevin Munoz.\n\nMunoz added that nearly half of that grassroots funding came from donors giving money to the campaign for the first time this election season.",

        "body": "Parade participants are seen marching during the 2024 Kentuckiana Pride Parade on June 15, 2024 in Louisville, Kentucky. Stephen J. Cohen | Getty Images\n\nPride month is winding down \u2014 and this year, the corporate world took a more cautious approach. June tends to bring a wave of rainbow-themed merchandise and affirming ads and social media posts from retailers and consumers brands, coinciding with parades and other events that celebrate the LGBTQ+ community. As the presidential election approaches, however, some companies have grown quieter about diversity, equity and inclusion efforts to avoid stepping into the culture wars or facing the blowback from conservative customers that Target and Bud Light did a year ago. The starkest example of that came late Thursday: Tractor Supply, a retailer that sells animal feed, cowboy boots and lawn supplies in rural parts of the country, said it is ending all spending tied to diversity and environmental causes. That includes no longer sponsoring Pride festivals, the statement said. The move, while an outlier in its magnitude, underscores how some companies that made inclusion commitments in recent years are treading cautiously. It is difficult to track how many companies shared supportive messages, donated to LGBTQ+ causes or sold rainbow-themed merchandise in June compared to previous years. According to Gravity Research, a Washington, D.C.-based reputational research firm, 45% of Fortune 100 companies had at least one social media post on LinkedIn or X explicitly related to Pride as of June 21 this year, compared with 51% last June. Gravity Research President Luke Hartig said the volatility of the presidential election and the two candidates' willingness to call out companies by name has also made companies less likely to go public about their stand. \"There's a little bit of like, 'keep our heads down while we go through this election,'\" he said. Tim Bennett, cofounder of Tribury Productions, a marketing company that specializes in reaching LGBTQ+ Americans, works with Fortune 500 companies, including recent projects with Procter & Gamble. He said more clients have taken \"a wait-and-see\" approach to marketing to LGBTQ+ consumers or decided to scatter efforts throughout the year instead of making a big splash in a single month. \"June this year has not been like the last five or six,\" Bennett said. That may not be a bad thing for LGBTQ+ initiatives and charities. Sarah Kate Ellis, CEO of nonprofit advocacy group GLAAD, said she's seeing more companies get involved with year-round philanthropy and activism in more meaningful ways. She also pointed to a survey by Gravity Research that found that 78% of companies did not plan to change their Pride strategy this year. Thirteen percent were unsure whether they'd make changes and 9% said they planned to revise their strategy. Gravity Research surveyed 45 corporate executives and Fortune 500 leaders across industries in April. \"The visibility of companies putting flags out and having product to celebrate our Pride and to mark a month that's really significant and important for our community is really important, and I don't want to ever devalue that,\" Ellis said. \"I do think, though, those companies must look inside and make sure that they have the policies and the HR practices that match their outward marketing.\" Major companies are still writing checks for LGBTQ+ causes, too. A GLAAD spokesperson said Friday that the group has not seen donations or corporate support decline this Pride month, though it does not yet have a total tally. On Friday, when the Stonewall National Monument Visitor Center officially opened its doors to commemorate the New York City bar that was a catalyst in the LGBTQ+ rights movement, the event had major backing from the business community. Supporters included Google, Amazon, JPMorgan Chase and Booking.com. President Joe Biden also made an appearance and remarks at the monument's opening.\n\nPride Month merchandise is displayed at a Target store on May 31, 2023 in San Francisco, California. Justin Sullivan | Getty Images\n\nThe Bud Light and Target effect\n\nConsumer staples brands were the most likely to say they planned to shift their Pride month strategy this year, according to Gravity Research's survey. That may stem from the conservative boycotts of Target and Bud Light last year. Target has carried a Pride collection for over a decade. Yet last year, the big-box retailer removed some items and moved displays after employees faced threats. Boycotters targeted items for transgender shoppers, such as \"tuck-friendly\" swimsuits, and also criticized separate Pride merchandise for kids. Instead of putting Pride merchandise in all stores this year, Target only carried it in the locations that accounted for 90% of total Pride sales in 2022 and 2023. It also stopped selling any Pride apparel for kids. On the company's website and in those select stores, shoppers can find a wide variety of Pride-themed items. The volume of negative feedback to the Pride collection externally and internally is \"significantly lower\" this year than in 2023, according to a Target spokesperson. In a statement, Target said it is \"committed to supporting the LGBTQIA+ community during Pride Month and year-round\" and would participate in Pride events across the country and support LGBTQ+ groups, in addition to offering Pride products.\n\nA sign disparaging Bud Light beer is seen along a country road on April 21, 2023 in Arco, Idaho. Anheuser-Busch, the brewer of Bud Light has faced backlash after the company sponsored two Instagram posts from a transgender woman. Natalie Behring | Getty Images\n\nAnheuser-Busch InBev and other large beer brands, on the other hand, have backed away from public support of the LGBTQ+ community. Conservatives like singer Kid Rock and Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis called for a boycott of the beer and its parent company, Anheuser-Busch InBev, after Bud Light sent personalized cans of its beer to transgender influencer Dylan Mulvaney. The marketing campaign coincided with the March Madness college basketball tournament. Bud Light sales tumbled around 25%, and the brand lost its spot as the best-selling beer in the U.S., ceding the position it held for more than two decades to Constellation Brands' Modelo. AB InBev distanced itself from Mulvaney and fired Bud Light's vice president of marketing. In October, AB InBev CEO Michel Doukeris said the brand would focus its marketing more on events like sports games and concerts. It also returned as the official sponsor of the UFC. In recent months, some consumers have returned to Bud Light, as RBC Europe analysts estimate that the brand's U.S. volume is down only about 10% these days. For its part, Bud Light hasn't posted in support of Pride month on its Instagram or X pages this year. The boycott was unusually sticky for a few reasons, according to Neil Reid, a geography professor at the University of Toledo who researches the beer industry. Studies have shown that consumers' loyalty to top-selling beers may be more tied to the brand than the taste, Reid said. Right-wing news outlets like Fox News also devoted plenty of airtime to the controversy, stretching its duration and potentially reaching new consumers who missed the initial reaction. Plus, once Bud Light sales fell, retailers gave more shelf space to its rivals. \"You can look at this issue from a moral, ethical perspective or you can also look at it from a pure business perspective. Those two often don't result in the same strategy,\" Reid said.\n\nThe New York Stock Exchange welcomes e.l.f.

The blunders happened even on topics like abortion and the economy, which he tends to be cogent on during campaign rallies and White House events.\n\nThe messaging from Obama and Clinton marks a shift in strategy for Democrats as they try to course-correct after Thursday's flop.\n\nMuch of Democrats' spin immediately following the debate attempted to play down Biden's conspicuous blunders, instead attacking Trump's performance and giving Biden a generous evaluation.\n\n\"As the night went on, I think [Biden] really kind of rose to the occasion,\" Biden co-campaign chair Mitch Landrieu told NBC News Thursday night after the debate. \"I'm proud of the fact that he stood up to Donald Trump.\"\n\nThe comments from Obama and Clinton represent a new tact: Acknowledge the debate disaster and then tell the public not to focus on it.\n\nBiden himself followed that framing on Friday during a rally in North Carolina: \"Folks, I don't walk as easily as I used to. I don't speak as smoothly as I used to. I don't debate as well as I used to. But I know what I do know: I know how to tell the truth.\"\n\nBut debates do matter to voters. After the September 2020 debate, a slew of polls found that voters thought Biden did a better job, which helped him maintain his lead against Trump.\n\nThis year's presidential race has been a near dead-heat so far and will likely be won by tight margins come November, leaving little room for error.\n\nIn the days since the debate, Democrats have been concerned about how it might weigh on voter perceptions, which are already rife with worries about Biden's age and fitness to lead the country for another four years.\n\nSome Democratic strategists, donors and pundits have already suggested that Biden should drop out of the race and reopen the Democratic field to potentially stronger candidates.\n\nThe Biden campaign has so far rejected that proposal. Biden and Trump are scheduled to face off at a second and final debate on Sept. 10.",

        "body": "U.S. President Joe Biden attends the first presidential debate hosted by CNN in Atlanta, Georgia, U.S., June 27, 2024. Marco Bello | Reuters\n\nPresident Joe Biden's raspy, unfocused, often inarticulate and widely panned debate performance stoked deep anxiety among Democrats \u2014 and caused some commentators and fundraisers to openly call for a new nominee to run against former President Donald Trump. But replacing Biden as the party's pick less than five months out from Election Day carries enormous political risks and would be difficult, if not impossible, to pull off. Right now, the only likely way Biden could be replaced is if he willingly ends his campaign. And Biden's aides and top Democratic officials say the 81-year-old incumbent has no plans to do so. If he did drop out, Democrats have yet to identify a clear alternative candidate to swap in. But the panic among donors and party officials after watching Biden falter Thursday night in his debate against Trump has led some of them to take steps to get Biden out of the race. There are already discussions among Democratic fundraisers about trying to convince congressional leaders \u2014 Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer in particular \u2014 to urge Biden to announce to drop out, according to people familiar with the matter who were granted anonymity to speak freely.\n\nUS President Joe Biden, with Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer (L), speaks to the press after meeting with the Senate Democratic caucus to build support for his infrastructure and economic investment goals during the Democratic luncheon at the US Capitol on July 13, 2021 in Washington, DC, July 14, 2021. Saul Loeb | AFP | Getty Images\n\nSchumer, D-N.Y., is a top target for donors making that pitch because he privately has voiced concerns about Biden's standings in presidential election polls, those people said. Schumer was worried before the debate that Biden and Trump were statistically tied nationally, despite the Republican challenger's conviction in his New York criminal hush money trial. A spokesman for Schumer declined to comment to CNBC but pointed to a social media post the majority leader published after the debate. Schumer in that X post wrote: \"Tonight's debate made the choice clear: Four more years of progress, or four more years of attacks on our fundamental rights and our democracy.\" \"We've got to get out the vote for Joe Biden, Kamala Harris, and a Democratic Senate and House!\" the post said. That spin has not alleviated the post-debate anxiety felt by some of the president's top fundraisers. Some of those wealthy donors have lost trust in Biden's team, believing they were given false assurances about Biden's ability to take on Trump. And some of those donors who already planned to attend a high-dollar fundraiser Saturday in the Hamptons section of Long Island say they will attend the event to judge for themselves whether Biden can continue as a viable candidate. \"Democrats are in a very difficult situation because it's late in the campaign for a change,\" said Meena Bose, director of the Peter S. Kalikow Center for the Study of the American Presidency at Hofstra University, in an interview with CNBC. The only feasible way Bose could see it playing out is with Biden throwing his full support behind Vice President Kamala Harris to become the new nominee.\n\nU.S. Vice President Kamala Harris gives remarks on conflict-related sexual violence at an event in the Eisenhower Executive Office Building on June 17, 2024 in Washington, DC. Anna Moneymaker | Getty Images\n\nOtherwise, Democrats have a wide-open nomination fight just a few months before the Nov. 5 election, she said. Bose called that a \"disastrous\" prospect.\" \"Vice President Harris is a risky choice, but certainly has the visibility and is the logical choice,\" said Bose. \"It's difficult to see how you open up the Democratic presidential nomination now and have a unified path to victory in November,\" she added.\n\nHowever, even if Biden backed Harris to replace him ahead of the Democratic National Convention in August, there is no guarantee that the delegates he has won so far will shift their support to her. Biden has won nearly all of the roughly 4,000 Democratic-pledged delegates, far exceeding the threshold to make him the party nominee. If Biden refuses to drop out before August, the only opportunity to boot him as nominee would be at the Democratic National Convention that month. It is technically possible that Biden's delegates could abandon him en masse then and throw open the convention to nominate another candidate. Some Democrats who want an alternative to Biden but are concerned about Harris' relatively low opinion polls and rocky campaign history have looked to California Gov. Gavin Newsom, Ohio Sen. Sherrod Brown, Illinois Gov. J.B. Pritzker and others as possible contenders.\n\nCalifornia Governor Gavin Newsom (D) reacts as he speaks to the members of the press on the day of the first presidential debate hosted by CNN in Atlanta, Georgia, U.S., June 27, 2024. REUTERS/Marco Bello Marco Bello | Reuters\n\nBut blocking Biden from the nomination is highly improbable, as delegates tend to be strong supporters of their chosen candidate. \"That is probably the worst-case scenario,\" Bose said. \"If the Democrats are going to have a change at the top of the ticket, President Biden has to endorse it and, frankly, probably initiate it.\" The DNC rules allow for the party to select another presidential nominee, but only in the \"event of death, resignation or disability\" that leaves the role vacant.\n\nwatch now",

The average American spends $16.26 out of pocket per prescription, according to the data.\n\n\"When things increase \u2026 inevitably, they do trickle down to consumers, especially those who are in a high deductible plan or who don't have insurance or find themselves paying substantially out of pocket,\" said GoodRx director of research Tori Marsh.\n\nGoodRx said the patients' share of the cost continues to grow due to rising copays, coinsurances and deductibles. The company found that over the past 10 years, the average person's deductible nearly doubled, and copays are rising as the majority of plans are adding another tier of drugs with higher copays.\n\nIt is a dynamic GoodRx deems \"the big pinch.\" High medication costs are coupled with reduced insurance coverage. Analyzing coverage for more than 3,700 Medicare Part D plans between 2010 and 2024, GoodRx found that the portion of medications covered dropped 19% during that period.\n\n\"The impact is really kind of threefold,\" Marsh said. \"Rising costs or rising prices are a big part of it, but it's really that with the combination of increased friction. \u2026 It's hard for people to, in some ways, access their medication or access a pharmacy. And then on top of that, insurance is not what it used to be. It's not covering as much as it used to.\"\n\nOn average, Americans pay two to three times more for prescription drugs than consumers in other developed countries, according to the White House.\n\nDrug costs have become a focus for President Joe Biden, particularly as he approaches the 2024 election. The Biden administration has taken several measures to lower out-of-pocket drug expenses.\n\nOn Wednesday, the White House announced it would lower prices on 64 prescription drugs for some Medicare beneficiaries as a result of inflation penalties on drugmakers.\n\nThe lower costs, effective during the third quarter, will benefit roughly 750,000 people who use the drugs annually, some of whom could save up to $4,593 per day, according to the release.\n\n\"Despite efforts by policymakers and industry leaders to break down affordability and accessibility barriers, a patient's actual out-of-pocket cost continues to increase and is often a huge surprise to them,\" said GoodRx interim CEO Scott Wagner in a news release.\n\n\u2014 CNBC's Annika Kim Constantino contributed to this report.",

The airline's unit revenue, the amount it brings in for every seat it flies one mile, outpaced its competitors' last year. Delta's share price has soared more than 17% in 2024, one of the strongest performers in the rocky airline sector, in a rally that's outdone the S&P 500 's. It expects free cash flow to rise as much as 50% this year to between $3 billion and $4 billion, and is eyeing a return to an investment-grade credit rating. And a stat any traveler would appreciate: Delta came in first in punctuality last year, with more than 83% of its flights arriving on time, according to the Transportation Department. Rival United Airlines \u2014 second to Delta in net profit margins \u2014 is circling. It says it could grow profit even more this year. \"Knowing that there's someone that thinks that they can take that mantle from us, that keeps us on our toes and keeps us continuing to drive hard,\" Bastian told CNBC.\n\nEd Bastian, chief executive officer of Delta Air Lines Inc., during an interview in New York, US, on Monday, Nov. 7, 2022. Bastian said that he sees 'strong demand' for flights carrying into 2023. Jeenah Moon | Bloomberg | Getty Images\n\nDelta has fashioned itself as America's premium airline. It has won over hordes of splurging travelers, many of them carrying American Express cards, Delta's cash cow of a partner that generated almost $7 billion for the airline last year. Sales growth of Delta's roomier and more expensive seats continues to outpace revenue from standard coach. As they vie for luxury flyers, both Delta and United have added more high-end seating to their planes to cater to travelers who deem worthwhile a $300 surcharge for a few inches of extra legroom on a cross-country round trip, or 10 times as much for a seat in business class. Bastian, a former auditor who said he took his first flight at age 25 for a business trip (New York to Chicago), is in charge of ensuring Delta lives up to its brand luster. On Wednesday, Delta took its next shot in the battle for high-spending flyers when it opened its newest, highest tier of airport lounge at New York's John F. Kennedy International Airport for passengers in its Delta One cabin, its top cabin that features lie-flat beds for longer flights. At more than 39,000 square feet it is Delta's largest lounge, accented with pillows that have the iconic zigzag motif of Italian fashion house Missoni, its new amenity kit partner. It features complimentary spa treatments, like ice globes and serum for jet-lagged eyes, along with showers, a full restaurant, and a deck overlooking the airfield, in a bet that travelers' desire to treat themselves is here to stay. Delta is taking a page from the playbooks of United and American , which already dedicate their swankiest lounges to customers flying in long-haul business class. Delta plans to open Delta One lounges in Boston and Los Angeles later this year, and is studying airports where it could open others. \"The thing with this industry is no good idea goes uncopied,\" said Raymond James airline analyst Savanthi Syth. Meanwhile, United is placing huge orders for new Boeing and Airbus planes and remodeling hundreds of narrow-body cabins that feature seatback screens and Bluetooth technology, a strategy that aims to cater to travelers from international business class to those flying on the cheapest basic economy tickets. \"We haven't exactly achieved the No. 1 profitability status in the industry, but I know we're on our way,\" United's chief commercial officer, Andrew Nocella, said in an interview last month. \"If we continue to invest in our customers through great service and great products and great network, we know that will feed upon itself and it'll help us achieve the financial results that we're looking for.\" Delta, United and American are approaching their 100th birthdays, and are trying to stay ahead \u2014 if not drive \u2014 shifting travel demand and still turn a profit. United is adding to the more than 300 airports it serves. Figuring out the next hot destination is \"part art\" and \"part science,\" said Patrick Quayle, its head of network planning. The airline's sprawling global network makes United the biggest U.S. airline by capacity and it recently launched service to places like Dubrovnik, Croatia, and Amman, Jordan. Quayle pointed to United's addition of Cape Town, South Africa, which it first announced before the pandemic, as a success. \"Another airline has subsequently copied us. ... I might want to add based in Atlanta,\" he said, alluding to Delta's home city. The latest changes come at a difficult time for a lot of U.S. airlines. Labor and other costs swelled after the pandemic, eating into margins despite record numbers of travelers. Added capacity in the U.S. market has forced carriers to discount fares in off-peak travel periods. It's tricky, and expensive, to change course. Even Southwest Airlines is facing investor pressure to add things like premium seating or seat assignments as its simple, but long successful, business model shows signs of age.\n\nZoom In Icon Arrows pointing outwards FactSet\n\nMeanwhile, U.S. consumers are growing more selective: Some corporate leaders have lamented a spending pullback while others, like Delta's CEO, are saying the opposite. Americans are still digging into the so-called experiences economy, and paying for more comfort along the way, according to Bastian. \"They may not be buying that new EV or that new house, but they're saying we're going to go out and experience the world and invest in that experience,\" he said. \"And that's why you see it happening in high-end concerts, high-end hospitality.\"\n\n'Brick by brick'\n\nWhen the U.S. was careening toward recession almost two decades ago, Delta's leaders made a correct bet that travelers would eventually pay more to fly on its jets. Delta was emerging from Chapter 11 bankruptcy in 2007, which other U.S. carriers found themselves in the years after the Sept. 11, 2001, terrorist attacks. Former CEO Richard Anderson said the airline had to start with basics: stop losing bags. Make sure flights didn't get canceled and arrived on time. Clean up the cabins. \"It was about building the operation brick by brick,\" said Anderson, who handed the reins to Delta's former president, Bastian, in 2016. \"It didn't matter what you did with AmEx. If the flight canceled, you ruined your brand.\" Delta took better care to avoid maintenance problems. It also started ferrying planes to airports to avoid cancellations if a replacement aircraft was needed. And the carrier tried to clean up its image, hiring a marketing firm that advised former President Barack Obama's 2008 presidential campaign.\n\nwatch now\n\nAnderson said the airline needed to be consistent and not fly its mix of paint jobs and cabin interiors. It faced fresh competition from low-cost airlines like a then-spritely upstart out of Queens, New York, called JetBlue Airways . Delta and United had both launched their own low-cost subsidiaries, but they discontinued them. Delta executives knew they needed a brand to match if they were going to command a premium over competitors. \"One of the things about being a premium product is consistency, consistency in policy, consistency in appearance,\" said Anderson. \"If you got on a flight in Tokyo we wanted you to feel like you were home.\" After the string of changes, Delta's performance improved. Corporate business travel contracts helped boost profits and still do, as business travel returns post-pandemic. Delta had a key advantage over competitors. After it came out of bankruptcy, it merged with Northwest Airlines in 2008, allowing it to stabilize and expand around the world while other carriers floundered. The rest of the industry spent much of the next decade recovering from bankruptcies and a subsequent musical chairs of mergers that left four big carriers in control of about three-quarters of the U.S. domestic market. Delta's rivals were years behind the carrier on integrating their merged staff, operations, networks and fleets. Bastian said Delta's focus on reliability has made life easier for not just its customers, but also its employees. \"They're not having to explain for a cancellation or mishandled luggage,\" he said. \"They have time to serve rather than to apologize.\" Delta is also unique as the least unionized of the major U.S. airlines, at about 20%. In April, as campaigns were underway to organize its flight attendants and other workers, it again raised worker pay. Flight attendants for Delta's regional carrier, Endeavor, which are unionized, have recently demanded compensation on par with the carrier's mainline flight attendants.\n\nTime to remodel\n\nAfter Delta got the basics down, Bastian, 67, who joined Delta in 1998, said it was time for the airline to focus on more ambitious projects. \"You had the liberty to start investing in premium,\" he said. \"You started to figure out how to make first class more available to customers.\" It has expanded in big-spending New York and Los Angeles, the country's two largest air travel markets by revenue, according to aviation data firm OAG. Delta also built up its host of global alliances, joint ventures and minority ownership stakes, giving it more reach. That includes its 49% stake in Virgin Atlantic, which already had a strong foothold in premium air travel and popular lounges. \"I think some of that heritage has made its way into the core of Delta,\" said Virgin Atlantic's CEO, Shai Weiss. \"I'm not suggesting we are the messiah for Delta, but there is no surprise that Delta and Virgin Atlantic see eye to eye on many things.\" The vast majority of the more than 940 million people who flew on U.S. airlines last year fly in coach, and Delta has tried to make its flights more desirable to travelers on all sections of the plane. It remodeled old and dated terminals, and built out its network of luxury airport lounges, which are tied to its lucrative credit card deal with American Express. It added seatback televisions and better in-flight entertainment options, and in February 2023, it announced its long-awaited free Wi-Fi to customers enrolled in its SkyMiles frequent flyer program.\n\nwatch now\n\nDelta has invested more than $12 billion to rebuild and update its U.S. hubs with soaring ceilings, new technology and in some lounges, a signature scent. (\"It's proprietary,\" said Claude Roussel, who oversees Delta's lounges, when asked what was in it.) One of its latest efforts is its terminal and new Sky Club at New York's LaGuardia Airport, alongside other airlines' new terminals. A decade ago, then-Vice President Joe Biden famously said someone who was blindfolded and taken to that airport would think, \"I must be in some third-world country.\" The airline faced big problems along the way like a dayslong system outage in 2016. And the worst of all: Covid-19. Like other airlines, Delta accepted billions in federal aid to weather the pandemic. The carrier successfully urged some 17,000 workers to take buyouts, hiring newer, lower-paid staff who lacked the experience of departed employees. Early in the process, Bastian said the newer workers gave the company a \"juniority benefit.\" The airline employed about 100,000 people in the U.S. as of the end of last year. Delta and its competitors also pulled out of many small cities as the pandemic eased, isolating some smaller cities amid a shortage of regional jet pilots. But international travel has proved resilient so far, as consumers show they are willing to shell out on experiences.\n\nLuxury air travel? In the U.S.?\n\nLuxury air travel and the United States didn't go together for many years \u2014 and might not still, if you ask well-heeled globetrotters. U.S. airlines don't offer on-board showers or roomy suites like those on the superjumbos flown by the likes of Etihad Airways or Singapore Airlines. But the U.S. air travel market, the world's largest, has gotten a number of upgrades in recent years, and travelers have grown to expect the same convenience they get from their online shopping sites and ride-hailing and food-ordering apps. \"Delta's not bougie by any stretch, but when your competitors don't try very hard, it doesn't take much,\" said Henry Harteveldt, a former airline executive and founder of Atmosphere Research Group. But as a rewards credit card boom, strong consumer spending, social media envy and a wanderlust that predated the pandemic combined to boost demand, airlines executives were taking notice. Delta's sales from premium products are growing faster than revenue from its main coach cabin, a trend the airline forecasts will continue. Sales from Delta's loyalty business, premium cabins and other streams comprise more than half of the carrier's revenue. Airlines have made big changes as they struggle to accommodate the swelling numbers of big-spending travelers armed with elite status. Major carriers have all overhauled their frequent flyer programs to reward the biggest spenders instead of those who fly the most miles, and made it harder to earn coveted elite status. And at Delta and other airlines, many of the perks for luxury flyers come through lounges. One of Delta's Sky Clubs at Los Angeles International Airport offers a separate, dedicated security checkpoint for customers flying Delta One, away from the masses at the airport. That feature will make it to the new JFK lounge later this year, a Delta spokesman said. United and American Airlines have also worked to glam up and expand their airport lounges, access to which is a common perk with credit cards. Delta softened some restrictions on Sky Club lounge access last year \u2014 which it made to end annoying and unsightly long lines to enter its exclusive airport real estate \u2014 after an uproar from customers.\n\n'We're constantly pushing each other\"\n\nBoth Delta and United have issued sunny financial forecasts for this year, while many carriers are losing money or not pulling in similar profit margins. \"Watching [Delta] succeed, I became convinced that the product mattered and service mattered, and we have done that at United now,\" United CEO Scott Kirby said at a JPMorgan industry conference in March. And at an investor conference last month, he pointed to how the two are pulling away from the rest of the pack in profitability, particularly at big hubs. United has made some big bets that paid off. It held onto its wide-body planes, when travel demand collapsed in the pandemic, and has benefited from the surge in international travel. With United on Delta's tail, Bastian is trying to expand the airline's reach. Bastian has attended the massive Consumer Electronics Show in Las Vegas and has announced new partnerships with Lyft and Starbucks for its loyalty program.\n\nwatch now",

They worry evil actors on the world stage might take advantage of the world's greatest superpower being led by a frail, weak, commander-in-chief.\n\nIf America's Leader is Frail & Weak, Will Israel's Enemies Choose Now to Strike Harder?\n\nAs columnist Amnon Lord put it in Israel Hayom, \u201cIn a world rife with aggressive forces, the unflattering image of an American president \u2013 the leader of the free world \u2013 appearing weak and incoherent encourages them to exploit opportunities.\u201d\n\nIsraeli columnist Nadav Eyal added in Yediot Ahronot, , \"Weakness is not a trait that an American president can convey, by any means.\"\n\nSenator John Barrasso (R-Wyoming) expressed similar worries on Fox News this weekend, saying, \"It's what foreign leaders \u2013 our enemies \u2013 saw in that debate, in China, Russia, Iran, North Korea. Right now are they thinking, 'This is our moment of opportunity?'\"\n\nBiden Administration Accused of Still Withholding 7 Weapons Systems from Israel\n\nIsraeli Defense Minister Yoav Gallant told Israel Defense Forces in northern Israel this weekend it's their military might that may intimidate Hezbollah enough that it will halt its daily attacks in the region and negotiate a peace deal.\n\nGallant declared the nation is readying either for war or for peace, noting Israel is \"preparing the military force, defense, attack, and this can happen quickly. On the other hand, the political alternative is being prepared. It is always preferable. We are not looking for war, but we are ready for it.\"\n\nHe added, \"The thing that gives us the flexibility to be able to discuss political solutions is that we have military solutions.\"\n\nBut as Israel may soon face war with Hezbollah and its more than 150,000 missiles, one highly-placed U.S. lawmaker says the Biden administration is still withholding seven weapons systems from the Jewish Nation.\n\nOn Fox News Sunday, Rep. Michael McCaul (R-Texas), who chairs the powerful House Foreign Affairs Committee revealed, \u201cThis is what is most disturbing to me, is that we\u2019re withholding weapon systems that I have signed off on and Congress has appropriated with the intent of sending those weapons to Israel.\u201d\n\n'Hamas is the Only Obstacle'\n\nNoa Argamani, one of those four Israeli hostages rescued in Gaza recently, is speaking out. She's reminding the nation that so many hostages remain in captivity.\n\nIn a video, she implored, \"We can't forget about the hostages who are still in Hamas captivity, and we must do everything possible to bring them back home.\"\n\nIsraeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu is pointing out that no hostage deal can currently be worked out because Hamas refuses to deal.\n\nAs he put it, \u201cAnd today everyone knows a simple truth: Hamas is the only obstacle to the release of our hostages.\"\n\nHamas claims the problem is that Israel won't agree to end the war and remove all its troops from Gaza.\n\n\"Without this being achieved, all that is presented is just a waste of time,\" said senior Hamas official Osama Hamdan.\n\nNetanyahu, though, contends that there is no way to end the war until Hamas is completely defeated by Israeli forces.\n\n\"Every day they (the IDF) eliminate dozens of terrorists,\" Netanyahu stated. \"It is a difficult struggle that is waged above ground, sometimes in face-to-face battles, and it is also waged underground.\"\n\n***Please sign up for CBN Newsletters and download the CBN News app to ensure you keep receiving the latest news from a distinctly Christian perspective.***",

        "body": "Comedian and famed political commentator Bill Maher predicted recently it\u2019s \u201cvery likely\u201d former President Donald Trump will win the November election.\n\nHe went on to condemn the modern political left as \u201caggressively anti-common sense\u201d during an interview with English journalist Tina Brown at the Aspen Ideas Festival in Colorado.\n\n\u201cPart of it the left has to own,\u201d he told Brown. \u201cThey are aggressively anti-common sense. The Democrats keep running on this one idea, saying to the American people, \u2018You can\u2019t possibly think you can do worse than Donald Trump.\u2019 And they keep saying, \u2018Yes, we can. Yes, we can.'\u201d\n\nMaher went on to explain he has Democratic friends who have leftist children, many of whom, the comedian suggested, accuse their parents of \u201cold thinking\u201d and not understanding their progressive points of view.\n\n\u201cTear down statues of Lincoln? Maybe give communism another shot? Get rid of the border patrol? Get rid of capitalism? White supremacy has never been worse? Gender is always just a social construct? It\u2019s OK to have penises in the women\u2019s swimming pool, in women\u2019s prisons?\u201d he said, listing a handful of the views held by leftists. \u201cNo, it\u2019s not that I\u2019m old; it\u2019s that your ideas are stupid.\u201d\n\nListen to the latest episode of \u201cQuick Start\u201d:\n\nMaher explained to Brown that, if Democrats insist on embracing far-leftist ideals and refuse to collaborate in any way with Republicans who oppose Trump, they are only aiding the GOP in defeating incumbent President Joe Biden.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s as good as it gets,\u201d he said. \u201cIf you can\u2019t talk to those people, you\u2019re just abandoning the country to half the people who are even worse, who are going to vote for Trump this next time \u2014 and they are \u2014 and he very likely will win, and then what are we going to do?\u201d\n\n\u201cI think we should keep the dialogue open,\u201d the HBO\u2019s \u201cReal Time\u201d host added.\n\nMaher recently appeared on the ABC talk show \u201cThe View,\u201d where he condemned those on the left who have chosen to vehemently oppose Israel and protest in support of Hamas.\n\n\u201cIf I had any doubt that I was right about the change that\u2019s happened in the left, watching people protest for a terrorist organization like Hamas \u2014 that straightened me out pretty quick,\u201d he said, later adding, \u201cIt\u2019s astounding to me that they can\u2019t tell the good guys from the bad guys, just morally. If you\u2019re for Hamas, just live in Gaza for a day \u2026 [even] before the war.\u201d\n\nUltimately, he said the best way to stop Israel from retaliating is to \u201cstop attacking Israel.\u201d\n\n***As the number of voices facing big-tech censorship continues to grow, please sign up for Faithwire\u2019s daily newsletter and download the CBN News app, to stay up-to-date with the latest news from a distinctly Christian perspective.***",

        "body": "The Supreme Court issued two separate rulings on Friday that take direct aim at the power of the federal government.\n\nIn what's widely known as the Chevron case, the court took a step to curb the ability of the ballooning federal bureaucracy to bypass Congress with backdoor regulations.\n\nIn the other case, the high court issued a ruling about obstruction that could have a big impact on the future of President Trump and Capitol riot defendants.\n\nThe Chevron Case & the 'Deep State'\n\n\n\nIn a far-reaching decision, the Supreme Court upended the 40-year-old Chevron precedent that made it easier for federal government agencies to create their own rules on issues like the environment, public health, and business regulations.\n\nThe original Chevron decision allowed federal agencies to unilaterally fill in the details whenever government officials claimed the laws passed by Congress were too ambiguous.\n\nCritics have argued for decades that only Congress has been given the power to legislate, so allowing bureaucrats broad power to invent thousands of regulations violates the U.S. Constitution. It's one of the reasons those critics have referred to the massive size of the federal government as the \"nanny state\" or even the \"deep state\" because unelected bureaucrats often seized that opportunity to operate autonomously from the legislative or judicial branches.\n\nTHE CHEVRON CASE David v Goliath: Small Businesses Fight Federal Bureaucracy at US Supreme Court\n\nBREAKING: In a major blow to the unelected administrative state, the Supreme Court has overruled the Chevron doctrine, which required courts to defer to the legal interpretations of unelected bureaucrats.\n\n\n\n\u201cChevron is overruled.\u201d pic.twitter.com/tqC5EYaUBl \u2014 Sean Davis (@seanmdav) June 28, 2024\n\nChief Justice John Roberts wrote the court's opinion stating, \"Perhaps most fundamentally, Chevron's presumption is misguided because agencies have no special competence in resolving statutory ambiguities. Courts do.\"\n\nTyler O'Neil, managing editor of the Daily Signal, wrote on X, \"This is a huge step forward for holding the administrative state\u2014and the deep state\u2014accountable.\"\n\nThe Capitol Riot and Obstruction\n\nIn the other major case, the Supreme Court made it harder to charge Capitol riot defendants with obstruction, a charge that also has been brought against former President Donald Trump.\n\nIn a 6-3 ruling, the court ruled that charging someone with obstructing an official proceeding must include proof that defendants tried to tamper with or destroy documents. Only some of the people who breached the Capitol on Jan. 6, 2021, fall into that category, so many of those cases are expected to be affected by reduced sentencing.\n\nLiberty Counsel Founder and Chairman Mat Staver said, \"This new narrow interpretation will make it difficult for these indictments to stand.\"\n\nChief Justice John Roberts wrote Friday's decision, joined by Justices Samuel Alito, Neil Gorsuch, Brett Kavanaugh, and Clarence Thomas, and by Biden nominee Justice Ketanji Brown Jackson.\n\nIt's unclear how the court's decision might affect the obstruction case by Special Counsel Jack Smith against Trump in Washington. But the high court is expected to release a separate decision Monday regarding presidential immunity, and that ruling will directly impact Smith's case.\n\n**Please sign up for CBN Newsletters and download the CBN News app to ensure you keep receiving the latest news.**",

        "body": "ATLANTA \u2013 Democrats are panicking over President Biden's shaky performance in last night's historic debate with former President Trump. Some are even calling for Biden to be replaced as the nominee.\n\n\n\nVoters were also concerned by what they saw from the president as he struggled and stumbled throughout the evening.\n\n\n\nWithin the opening minutes, he flubbed a line saying, \"What I've been able to do with the Covid, excuse me, with, dealing with everything we have to do with, look, if we finally beat Medicare.\"\n\nCognitive Concerns\n\n\n\nIt became clear to the former President's surrogates, that Biden was in trouble.\n\nRep. Elise Stefanik (R-NY) said, \"The Biden campaign said this would be the reset moment for Joe Biden's candidacy and what they saw, what the American people saw, was a weak, horrible president, who is the weakest president in our nation's history.\"\n\n\n\nVoter concerns about Biden's age and mental sharpness were on display during the 90-minute debate as the president struggled at times to answer questions.\n\n\n\nSen. Marco Rubio (R-FL) said, \"He repeated things that were not true and he also said things that, to be frank, there were times that I could not understand what he was saying.\"\n\n\n\nThe showdown had Biden and Trump, the two oldest candidates to ever seek the White House, trading barbs on a number of topics.\n\n\n\nOn the Economy\n\n\n\n\"The only jobs he created are for illegal immigrants and bounce back jobs that bounce back from the Covid. He has not done a good job, he's done a poor job, and inflation is killing our country,\" Trump said.\n\n\n\nOn Abortion\n\n\n\n\"We are not for late-term abortion. Period. Period, period,\" Biden said.\n\nTrump replied, \"Under Roe v Wade, you have late-term abortion. You can do whatever you want. Depending on the state, you can do whatever you want. We don't think that's a good thing. We think it's a radical thing. We think the Democrats are the radicals.\"\n\n\n\nOn Immigration\n\n\n\nBiden said, \"When he was president, he was taking separating babies from their mothers, put him in cages, making sure that the families were separated. That's not the way to go.\"\n\n\n\nTrump pushed back accusing Biden of putting in place weak border policies that make America unsafe.\n\nREAD ISIS Network Helped 400 Cross US Border Illegally - Many of Them Are Now Missing\n\n\"We have the largest number of terrorists coming into our country right now. All terrorists all over the world, not just in South America, all over the world. They come from the Middle East, everywhere, all over the world. That pouring in. And this guy just left it open.\"\n\nBiden's Poor Performance\n\n\n\nThe two also tackled wars in Ukraine and Gaza.\n\n\n\nBut by the end of the night, everyone was talking about President Biden's poor performance.\n\nMichigan resident Rosanne Ponkowski said, \"I have dealt with people that have dementia before, and it's very obvious just from the look on his face, not understanding what's going on, the surprised and shocked look sometimes, the eyes, the very stiff face, the very stiff hands, they're all very prominent signs of what's going on.\"\n\nThe White House tried to put a brave face on the evening telling reporters that Biden had a cold.\n\n\n\nSurrogates like California Governor Gavin Newsom (D) attempted to side-step voter concerns that the president is too old.\n\n\n\nCBN News directly asked Gov. Newsom, \"There's a lot of concern about the president's stamina and mental health. Are you concerned, 81 years old, are concerned about that going forward?\" Newsom replied, \"I'm worried about President Trump's stamina.\" We followed up with, \"No, I'm talking about the president.\" Newsom replied, \"No, I'm talking about President Trump as well.\"\n\n\n\nOne top Biden donor reportedly called the president's performance disqualifying, telling Reuters that he expects Democrats will urge him to step aside ahead of the party's national convention in August.\n\n***Please sign up for CBN Newsletters and download the CBN News app to ensure you keep receiving the latest news.***\n\nStill, in a post-debate rally, Biden told supporters that he was confident he could win against Trump. \"Look, we're going to beat this guy. We need to beat this guy. And I need you in order to beat him. You're the people I've run for,\" Biden said.\n\n\n\nComing into the debate, Biden and Trump found themselves nearly tied in some national opinion polls. We'll see in the coming days whether this debate did anything to significantly change those dynamics. For now, though, the race is set to be decided here in Georgia and a handful of other key swing states like Wisconsin, Michigan, and Arizona. Meanwhile, voters there and across the country will get another look at the candidates on September 10th.",

        "body": "An pro-life protestor is seen on the ground after being pushed during a protest by abortion activists at the Supreme Court, June 24, 2024. (AP Photo/Alex Brandon)\n\nIn one of the most eagerly anticipated opinions of this term, the U.S. Supreme Court has essentially decided to kick the can down the road on Idaho's abortion law.\n\nThe official release of the ruling comes a day after the decision was prematurely leaked by someone at the Supreme Court. It was published online briefly on Wednesday before being removed. A court spokeswoman said the post was a mistake.\n\nThe decision will allow emergency abortions for now in a procedural ruling that leaves key questions unanswered. For now, the Idaho case will continue to play out in lower courts, and could end up before the Supreme Court again.\n\nLiberty Counsel Founder and Chairman Mat Staver explained, \"This order means that the case returns to the Ninth Circuit, which had ordered that the appeal of the preliminary injunction be decided by the full court on an expedited basis without any further briefing. The abortion ban currently remains in place in Idaho, except for those in emergency room situations.\"\n\nWATCH Our Analysis: Supreme Court Rules on Idaho Abortion Ban\n\nWhat the Case Is Really About\n\nThe Biden administration had sued Idaho claiming the state's law violates a federal law called the Emergency Medical Treatment and Labor Act (EMTALA). The White House insists the EMTALA requires hospital emergency rooms to provide abortions to women if their general health is at risk. Idaho's law already provided an exception to save the life of the mother, so the case is seen as an effort to expand abortion access beyond that.\n\nIdaho Solicitor General Joshua Turner suggested the Biden administration's \"health\" definition is too broad because it could be interpreted to include many non-life-threatening health concerns, including mental health.\n\nAnd the Alliance Defending Freedom accused the Biden administration of trying to invent \"a federal abortion mandate by manipulating EMTALA.\"\n\nDuring the arguments at the court, Justice Samuel Alito said the EMTALA was not intended to include abortion because it specifically identifies unborn children as patients who should be cared for in emergency rooms.\n\n\"One potentially very important phrase in EMTALA,\" he said, \"is the reference to the woman's unborn child. Isn't that an odd phrase to put in a statute that imposes a mandate to perform abortions? Have you ever seen an abortion statute that uses the phrase, 'unborn child?'\"\n\nAlito pointed out, \"So in that situation, the hospital must stabilize the threat to the unborn child. And it seems like the plain meaning is that the hospital must try to eliminate any immediate threat to the child. Performing an abortion is antithetical to that duty.\"\n\n***Please sign up for CBN Newsletters and download the CBN News app to ensure you keep receiving the latest news from a distinctly Christian perspective.***\n\nAbortion Leaks at the Supreme Court\n\nTwo years ago, Politico obtained a draft of the Dobbs ruling that overturned Roe v. Wade, stoking widespread outrage by pro-choice activists before the ruling was officially meant to be revealed. It fueled extremists who began firebombing and vandalizing pro-life pregnancy clinics and issuing death threats to the workers who try to help women facing unexpected pregnancies.\n\nThe Supreme Court never discovered who infamously leaked that Dobbs ruling, and now there is speculation about why this Idaho abortion ruling was also leaked.\n\n\n\nPro-life activist Kristan Hawkins posted on X, \"With media reporting on what appears to be a disappointing outcome in the EMTALA case, you have to wonder whether it's time for some people working on our nation's highest court need to be invited to find new jobs. Did the person who leaked the Dobbs decision 'accidentally' post today? Inquiring minds want to know.\"",

Now there's been a major revelation about how the Biden administration has pushed the transgender agenda when it comes to children.\n\nAccording to the New York Times, Biden officials played a significant role in convincing an international pro-transgender medical group to remove age limits from its guidelines for trans surgeries.\n\n\"Email excerpts from members of the World Professional Association for Transgender Health (WPATH) recount how staff for Adm. Rachel Levine, assistant secretary for health at the Department of Health and Human Services and herself a transgender woman, urged them to drop the proposed limits from the group's guidelines and apparently succeeded,\" The Times reports.\n\nThe administration was reportedly concerned that age minimums would trigger political backlash that could fuel legislation opposing the trans ideology.\n\nMore than two dozen states now have laws restricting gender-altering medical experiments on the bodies of minors. And this week, the Supreme Court agreed to hear the Biden administration's challenge to one of those laws.\n\nLATEST Supreme Court Takes up Hot Topic of Gender-Altering Procedures on Children\n\nCritics say children are too young to make these irreversible, life-altering decisions while supporters claim that young people with gender dysphoria need the procedures right away.\n\nBut as CBN News reported earlier this year, U.S.-based think tank Environmental Progress reported that even the WPATH admitted behind closed doors that \"children and adolescents cannot comprehend the lifelong consequences of 'gender-affirming care,' and in some cases, due to poor health literacy, neither can their parents.\"\n\nMORE Leaked Files Reveal Major Risks with Transgender Experiments: 'It Is Not Medicine'\n\nWhen we confronted WPATH about those claims, Marci Bowers, M.D., president of the group, told us in a statement, \"The world is not flat. Gender, like genitalia, is represented by diversity. The small percentage of the population that is trans or gender diverse deserves healthcare and will never be a threat to the global gender binary.\"\n\n**Please sign up for CBN Newsletters and download the CBN News app to ensure you keep receiving the latest news from a distinctly Christian perspective.***\n\nMeanwhile, England and other European nations are backing away from transition procedures on minors after studies showed \"weak evidence\" that they lead to long-term positive impacts.\n\n\"This is one instance in which I think Europe is headed in the right direction,\" Sarah Parshall Perry of the Heritage Foundation told CBN's Wendy Griffith. \"In addition to that, we are now seeing Norway, Finland, Sweden, and now the most recent edition is Scotland who has backed off the use of chemical castration agents as well.\"\n\nThere is also a growing number of people who regret undergoing gender transition and are seeking to revert back to their biological gender. They're warning distressed children and their families about rushing into life-altering medical decisions.\n\n2024: Pediatrician Group Points to 60 Studies Showing Gender Transition Has No Long-Term Benefit\n\n2022: Biden Admin Wants Sex-Change Surgery for Minors to Be Covered by Taxpayer Dollars\n\nREAD England's Health Service Unveils Shocking Revelations About Transgender Youth: A 'Transient Phase'?\n\nREAD 'Not Safe': Britain's Tavistock Sex-Change Clinic for Children Closed After Damning Report",

This debate is also the earliest in modern history, well ahead of the traditional fall schedule.\n\nNew rules aim to prevent chaotic scenes from past debates. There will be no live audience, no opening statements, and both candidates' microphones will be muted unless it's their turn to speak.\n\nPerformance on the debate stage might be the most crucial aspect for the 81-year-old Biden as Republicans highlight his age and mental health.\n\n\"Which Joe Biden's going to show up?\" asked House Speaker Mike Johnson. \"My summary is this: It doesn't matter if he drinks a whole gallon of energy drinks, he's not going to be able to match the acumen and the readiness of Donald Trump.\"\n\nNathan Gonzales from Inside Elections tells CBN News that because some Republicans have portrayed Biden as too old and incompetent, the real challenge may lie with Donald Trump. \"Trump is used to feeding off the crowd and energy in the room, and that's just not going to be there,\" Gonzales explained. \"Trump is going to have to be disciplined when it comes to time and whether the mic is on or off. He must avoid being perceived as a bully.\"\n\nBiden is expected to focus on Trump's 34 felony convictions\u2014a first for a presidential candidate\u2014and other pending criminal cases.

        "body": "JERUSALEM, Israel \u2013 There are media reports that Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu may be about to abandon his opposition to a Palestinian state next to Israel. That news comes as top Israeli leaders visited the border with Lebanon where war could break out any day.\n\nAides to the prime minister have reportedly told the White House that when Netanyahu addresses a joint session of Congress in July, he'll present a new take on achieving a pathway to a Palestinian state. That would be a huge shift.\n\nYet those reports may be wrong. The Prime Minister's Office told The Times of Israel that Netanyahu \"opposes a Palestinian state and will not change his position in his address to Congress.\"\n\nThe prime minister has consistently opposed Palestinian statehood in recent years, as poll after poll shows a huge majority of West Bank Palestinians themselves don't want a state next to Israel. They just want Israel destroyed.\n\nItamar Marcus, director of Palestinian Media Watch, points out most Palestinians hail the murderous attacks on Israelis, including what happened on October 7th.\n\n\"There's tremendous support within the West Bank for what happened on October 7th,\" Marcus stated. \"There was a poll taken a month and a half after October 7th \u2013 and everyone knew what happened, everybody knew about the rape and the destruction and the massacres \u2013 and Palestinians were asked 'With everything that's happened up till now, does it make you proud as a Palestinian?' And 98 percent of Palestinians said it made them proud.\"\n\nPreparing for War with Hezbollah & US Weapons Delays\n\nOn another front, both Netanyahu and Israeli President Isaac Herzog toured Israel's northern border with Lebanon this week. That's where all-out war may soon come, as the Jewish nation seeks to end daily attacks from Hezbollah on Israeli communities along the border.\n\nIn Washington, Israel's Defense Minister Yoav Gallant has supposedly made progress in speeding up shipments of weapons to the U.S. from Israel.\n\nNetanyahu has accused the Biden administration of deliberately slow-walking such shipments.\n\nFor the first time, the U.S. administration is admitting there have been bottlenecks in getting some of those weapons shipped.\n\nGallant addressed Americans, saying Israel needs the U.S. by its side. \"The powerful and enduring bond between the United States and Israel is key to our nation's strategy and our security,\" the defense minister said.\n\nPennsylvania Sen. John Fetterman has been one Democrat particularly strong in supporting Israel's war with Hamas as others have wavered. He's met with Netanyahu on his first visit here. \"We stand with Israel through this and I'm so sorry for what's been done to this nation,\" Fetterman declared.\n\nTurkey's President Recep Tayyip Erdogan pledged that his nation will stand with Hezbollah if it comes to war. He's condemning Western nations for backing Netanyahu, whose mental fitness he questioned. Erdogan asserted, \"It is extremely bad and pathetic that governments that talk about freedom, human rights, and justice are captives of a mentally ill person like Netanyahu.\"\n\nAntisemitism in NYC\n\nIn New York City, a masked man who demanded Jews get off a subway car earlier this month faces criminal charges of attempted coercion. He had yelled, \"Raise your hands if you're a Zionist \u2013 this is your chance to get out!\"\n\nEarlier this week, several dozen people protested against Manhattan District Attorney Alvin Bragg for his refusal to prosecute most of the anti-Israel demonstrators who illegally occupied Columbia University's Hamilton Hall this spring.\n\nOne protester said of Bragg, \"He's either a coward or an antisemite.\"\n\n***Please sign up for CBN Newsletters and download the CBN News app to ensure you keep receiving the latest news from a distinctly Christian perspective.***",

        "title": "Biden family: remain in race despite dreadful debate",
        "body": "President Joe Biden\u2019s family used a Sunday gathering at Camp David to urge him to stay in the race and keep fighting despite his dreadful debate performance, and some members criticized how his staff prepared him for the faceoff, according to four people familiar with the discussions.\n\nBiden spent the day sequestered with first lady Jill Biden, his children and grandchildren. It was a previously scheduled trip to the presidential retreat in Maryland for a photo shoot with Annie Leibovitz for the upcoming Democratic National Convention.\n\nBut the gathering was also an exercise in trying to figure out how to quell Democratic anxiety that has exploded following Thursday\u2019s performance.\n\nWhile his family was aware of how poorly he performed against Donald Trump, they also continue to think he\u2019s the best person to beat the Republican presumptive nominee. They also believe he is capable of doing the job of president for another four years, according to the people who were not authorized to speak publicly about internal discussions and spoke to The Associated Press on condition of anonymity.\n\nAmong the most vocal: Jill Biden and son Hunter, whom the president has long gone to for counsel and advice. Both believe the president shouldn\u2019t bow out when he\u2019s down, and believe that he can come back from what they see as one subpar performance. The family questioned how he was prepared for the debate by staff and wondered if they could have done something better, the people said.\n\nBiden\u2019s campaign has spent the days since the debate \u2014 where he appeared raspy, trailed off, and at times gave convoluted answers \u2014 working to keep donors and surrogates on board as Democrats increasingly questioned whether he should stay in the race.\n\nAt this point in the delegate process, Biden would likely have to decide to drop out for there to be a new nominee. And the people he listens to most in the world \u2014 his wife and son \u2014 are telling him to stay in.\n\nEven before the debate, the age of the 81-year-old Democratic president had been a liability with voters, and the prime-time faceoff appeared to reinforce the public\u2019s deep-seated concerns before perhaps the largest audience he will have in the four months until Election Day. CNN said more than 51 million people watched the debate.\n\nWhile the president was huddled with his family, prominent Democrats rallied to deliver a public show of support for his campaign on Sunday.\n\n\u201cI do not believe that Joe Biden has a problem leading for the next four years,\u201d said one close ally, Democratic Rep. James Clyburn of South Carolina. \u201cJoe Biden should continue to run on his record.\u201d\n\nSen. Raphael Warnock, a Georgia Democrat and Baptist minister, said there had been \u201cmore than a few Sundays when I wish I had preached a better sermon,\u201d relating the experience to Biden\u2019s debate performance.\n\n\u201cBut after the sermon was over, it was my job to embody the message, to show up for the people that I serve. And that\u2019s what Joe Biden has been doing his entire life,\u201d Warnock said. It was an echo of the message from other supporters that Biden had a bad debate, but a lifetime of good governance.\n\nWarnock, like Clyburn and others, pivoted to Trump\u2019s many falsehoods during the debate \u2014 lapses that Biden and the debate moderators often failed to fact check from the stage \u2014 including about the Jan. 6, 2021, attack on the Capitol by Trump supporters, immigration and the outcome of the 2020 election.\n\n\u201cWhenever his mouth was moving, he was lying,\u201d Warnock said of Trump.\n\nBut concern simmered among some Democrats that Biden\u2019s campaign and the Democratic National Committee were not taking seriously enough the impact of the debate.\n\nFormer Iowa Sen. Tom Harkin, who served for more than two decades with Biden in the Senate, called the debate \u201ca disaster from which Biden cannot recover.\u201d\n\nHarkin suggested that Democratic senators in pivotal races and \u201cmaybe all incumbent Democratic Senators should pen a letter to Biden asking him to release his delegates and step aside so the convention can choose a new candidate,\u201d according to an email to supporters that was obtained by The Associated Press. It was first referenced in Iowa journalist Julie Gammack\u2019s column on Saturday, Iowa Potluck.\n\n\u201cThis is a perilous time, and is more important than the ego or desires of Joe Biden to stay as President,\u201d Harkin concluded.\n\nRep. Jamie Raskin, D-Md., described \u201cvery honest, serious and rigorous conversations taking place at every level of our party \u2026 about what to do.\u201d\n\nBut DNC Chairman Jaime Harrison and Biden\u2019s campaign manager, Julie Chavez Rodriguez, held a Saturday afternoon call with dozens of committee members across the country \u2014 a group of some of the most influential members of the party \u2014 where they offered a rosy assessment of the path forward and gave no opportunity for others on the call to respond with questions.\n\nMultiple committee members on the call, most granted anonymity to talk about the private discussion, described feeling like they were being asked to ignore a serious predicament.\n\n\u201cThere were a number of things that could have been said in addressing the situation. But we didn\u2019t get that. We were being gaslit,\u201d said Joe Salazar, an elected DNC member from Colorado, who was on the call.",

        "body": "America was meant to be Britain\u2019s route to the sunlit uplands of Brexit. Then, after hopes of a free trade deal evaporated, successive Conservative governments have set their sights lower, by trying to forge closer ties with individual US states.\n\nNow the civil servants responsible for delivering those state-level deals have been let go, in what a furious British businessman described as \u201can act of arson\u201d.\n\nNearly a seventh of trade posts within British consulates in the US have been axed, with 24 people losing their jobs, 18 from 139 posts in the trade department. The decision was taken barely two weeks before Rishi Sunak called the general election.\n\nMany of the trade teams, based in the nine consulates across the US, had worked on trade pacts with Kemi Badenoch, the business and trade secretary, jetting around America to sign memorandums of understanding with governors of states including Florida, Indiana and Oklahoma.\n\nBut more importantly, according to British business leaders in the US, the regional trade directors and their staff had decades of experience and had built up contacts with American businesses from Google and Meta to the heads of Hollywood studios.\n\nView image in fullscreen Jules Ehrhardt says \u2018collective centuries of institutional knowledge\u2019 have been lost. Photograph: Jesse Grant/Getty Images\n\nJules Ehrhardt, a designer and investor, said there was \u201coutrage and disbelief in the British business community\u201d at the decision.\n\n\u201cThey are tossing out collective centuries of relational and institutional knowledge core to the UK-US trading relationship,\u201d he said. Ehrhardt moved to the US in 2012 to open the American arm of Ustwo, a digital design studio behind award-winning games such as Monument Valley, and worked with Google, Nike and Twitter, before founding a venture capital firm, FKTRY.\n\nHe said the consulate directors had \u201cserved as the connective tissue\u201d between British and American business leaders, making introductions, giving advice and lending their expertise. \u201cWe shot ourselves in both feet by undermining Britain\u2019s \u2018gateway to Europe\u2019 status for American companies following Brexit, and were told to go west, and now we\u2019ve self-elected a lobotomy,\u201d Ehrhardt said.\n\n\u201cThis [is an] act of arson in the final stages of this government. We claim it is a special relationship, yet remove our people at the very heart of it.\u201d\n\nAllan Rooney, founder of Rooney Law, which has helped more than 300 companies from the UK, Ireland and Australia enter the US market, said the directors were \u201cabsolutely critical in building strong and mutually beneficial trade relationships between UK and US businesses\u201d.\n\n\u201cThe facilitation of strategic introductions that these directors provide is a massive benefit,\u201d he said. \u201cThey plug companies into a market they otherwise don\u2019t know anything about. They familiarise them via trade missions and other methods to support and understand the market and the subtle differences between the UK and the US \u2018doing business\u2019 culture. Removing that layer will impact trade relations.\n\n\u201cMore than a million Brits are employed by American businesses \u2013 I can\u2019t think of a more important trade relationship post-Brexit. It\u2019s critical. And I think the removal of a very large swathe of intellectual capital and institutional knowledge is potentially worrisome. It could strain the trade teams who are already short on resources.\u201d\n\nskip past newsletter promotion Sign up to Observed Free weekly newsletter Analysis and opinion on the week's news and culture brought to you by the best Observer writers Enter your email address Sign up Privacy Notice: Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

This is especially true as we hope to see deals on critical minerals and digital trade reached with the US federal government in the next year or so.\u201d\n\nBoris Johnson, Liam Fox and other Brexiters had hoped that signing a trade deal with the US would provide economic growth for the UK, but Johnson failed to persuade either Donald Trump or Joe Biden. Last June, Rishi Sunak signed an \u201cAtlantic declaration\u201d with Biden which allowed UK firms access to some US subsidies.\n\nState-level deals have seen some recognition of British professional qualifications and removed some regulatory barriers.\n\nA UK government spokesperson said: \u201cThe UK\u2019s trade and investment teams in America are fully focused on furthering UK interests in the US, driving investment and strengthening our trading relationship with our closest ally. We continually keep our structures under review to ensure they deliver maximum impact for the UK, ensure the highest quality service to businesses, while offering taxpayers the very best value for money.\u201d",

        "body": "Down the years the Conservative party has taken some heavy election beatings but the one in prospect this week could be of a different order of magnitude.\n\nAssuming the polls are right \u2013 and they have been consistent since the start of the campaign \u2013 the Tories will do worse even than in 1906, their previous nadir. Back then, the Conservatives and their Liberal Unionist allies won just 156 seats, a repeat of which on Thursday would now be considered a good result.\n\nBut in 1906, Arthur Balfour\u2019s outgoing government secured more than 43% of the vote, while Rishi Sunak is polling at about half that level. And Balfour\u2019s defeat could at least be attributed to a policy issue \u2013 free trade versus protectionism. Today, voters just seem sick of the Tories.\n\nNews on the economy since the election was called has had little or no impact on the polls. In part, that\u2019s because the signals have been mixed: inflation fell back to its 2% target and growth in the first quarter of 2024 has been revised up, but the economy stagnated in April and unemployment has increased.\n\nLiving standards are certainly improving. The Resolution Foundation thinktank calculates that real per capita household disposable income \u2013 a guide to whether people are getting better off after inflation is taken into account \u2013 rose by 2.4% over the past year.\n\nThat\u2019s the good news. The bad news is that over the 2019-24 parliament as a whole, living standards fell by 0.6% and one of the unwritten rules of political economy is that governments don\u2019t remain popular when voters are getting poorer.\n\nOnly twice in the past century have living standards been lower at the end of a parliament than when it commenced: in 1918-22, when the UK suffered from a post-first world war boom-bust, and in the short parliament of 1950-51, when inflation rose sharply as a result of the rearmament programme for the Korean war.\n\nIn the inevitable postmortem examination that will follow the election, attention will focus on whether the Tories might have done better had Sunak delayed the election so that in time more voters would have come to think an economic corner genuinely had been turned. Another quarter or two of rising living standards would not have saved the Conservatives from defeat but it would probably have limited the scale of it.\n\nAs it is, Rachel Reeves will be the beneficiary. Analysts have been revising up their growth estimates for 2024 and 2025 on the basis that consumers will start to run down the precautionary savings they accumulated during the cost of living crisis.\n\nOther recent developments \u2013 especially those overseas \u2013 are not so welcome. Joe Biden\u2019s poor performance in his head to head debate with Donald Trump has made it more likely that the latter will win the US presidential election. Tariffs will be raised and taxes will be cut if that happens, threatening higher inflation and rising debt.\n\nMeanwhile, the first round of voting in France\u2019s parliamentary election looks set to show sizeable gains for Marine Le Pen\u2019s rightwing National Rally party and a defeat for Emmanuel Macron\u2019s centrist government.\n\nEvents in both the US and France highlight how things have changed in the near decade and a half since Labour was last in power.\n\nskip past newsletter promotion Sign up to Business Today Free daily newsletter Get set for the working day \u2013 we'll point you to all the business news and analysis you need every morning Enter your email address Sign up Privacy Notice: Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

The war between Ukraine and Russia is now well into its third year and has shattered the notion that permanent peace can be guaranteed for western developed nations. There are always demands for Labour governments to spend more on the NHS and on the welfare state. This time there will also be pressure to raise defence spending.\n\nGlobalisation has gone into retreat. Weak growth since the financial crisis of 2008-09 has seen a marked increase in protectionist measures \u2013 not just on goods but on people too. In Europe, North America and Australasia alike there have been demands for governments to restrict the number of foreign nationals entering the country.\n\nWhat\u2019s more, multilateral bodies are for the most part weaker than they were in 2010. The increasingly fractious relationship between the US and China means the G20 group of leading developed and developing nations cannot agree on much. The World Trade Organization is a much-diminished institution, unable to fulfil either of its core functions: to negotiate multilateral trade deals and be the final arbiter in trade disputes. The EU is having to contend with rising nationalist sentiment, a function of feeble economic performance and a reaction against rule by unelected technocrats.\n\nThe developing world has been even harder hit by Covid and the cost of living crisis than the rich west, increasing the incentive for migrants to look for a better life elsewhere. Yet aid budgets have been cut and promises to help poor countries cope with the impact of climate change have not been fulfilled. The world is getting hotter and the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank urgently need more money to meet demands for their assistance.\n\nSo those are the sort of challenges that Labour will face when it takes office later this week. Not the world of 1997, when Russia was seen as an ally rather than a strategic threat. Not the middle of the Great Moderation \u2013 the period between the fall of communism and the global financial crisis \u2013 when the west enjoyed year after year of growth and low inflation, but rather a world still trying to claw its way out of the Great Stagnation of the past 15 years.\n\nAnd an angrier world where voters can quickly turn on their governments. Labour should enjoy its honeymoon period. It might not last long.",
        "summary": "And Balfour\u2019s defeat could at least be attributed to a policy issue \u2013 free trade versus protectionism.\nNews on the economy since the election was called has had little or no impact on the polls.\nLiving standards are certainly improving.\nAnother quarter or two of rising living standards would not have saved the Conservatives from defeat but it would probably have limited the scale of it.\nThe World Trade Organization is a much-diminished institution, unable to fulfil either of its core functions: to negotiate multilateral trade deals and be the final arbiter in trade disputes.",

        "body": "View image in fullscreen Composite: Guardian Design Team/Getty\n\nUnless the polls are wildly inaccurate, the Conservative party is heading towards a catastrophic defeat in the coming election.\n\nAll across the rich world, voters are angry at their governments \u2013 they blame politicians for a burst of inflation that happened almost everywhere and is now subsiding almost everywhere, including in the UK. But the Conservatives deserve defeat more than most: they took power 14 years ago promising to deliver responsible policies and economic success. Instead they have presided over economic stagnation and a collapse in public services.\n\nWhy has Conservative governance gone so badly? It is natural to blame Brexit, which did indeed increase trade frictions and therefore surely had a negative effect on British real income. However, Brexit has not had the disastrous effects some predicted, and has somewhat perversely led to a rise rather than a fall in immigration, especially of the highly skilled.\n\nIn fact, the roots of Britain\u2019s poor economic performance are older and deeper than Brexit. Though many bad decisions undoubtedly contributed, one central cause was the way David Cameron and George Osborne gratuitously embraced fiscal austerity when they came to power after the global financial crisis.\n\nAt the time, this looked like an obvious macroeconomic error; more than a decade later, it has become a social and political catastrophe.\n\nLet us recall the circumstances when the Conservatives took power. The financial crisis had produced a severe global recession; by 2010 the world economy was growing again, but all major economies, Britain included, were still operating far below capacity and had high unemployment.\n\nTextbook economics tells us that when unemployment is high and inflation is low, governments should try to stimulate demand with reduced interest rates and fiscal deficits. Interest cuts were not an option because rates were already close to zero, so the indicated policy was fiscal stimulus.\n\nYet the Cameron government chose to do the opposite, pulling back fiscal support from an economy that still needed it badly. Britain was not the only nation turning to fiscal austerity in the face of high unemployment \u2013 Greece engaged in savage austerity, while Portugal, Spain, Italy and Ireland made large cuts, and fiscal policy in the US also turned contractionary.\n\nWhat made the British case unique was that it was almost entirely an unforced error. Southern European austerity was a response to pressure from the bond markets: Greece was in effect cut off from private markets, while other nations faced sharply increased borrowing costs, becoming dependent on official lenders who insisted on budget cuts as a condition for loans. Bond buyers never lost faith in the US, but after 2010 Barack Obama faced a deeply hostile Congress, which in effect blackmailed him into spending cuts by threatening to provoke a government default.\n\nWhile Britain had low borrowing costs like the US, its government was not divided. The Cameron executive could have chosen to maintain spending. Why did it turn to austerity?\n\nPart of the answer is that policymakers were genuinely spooked by the sudden emergence of the crisis in Greece. Until Greece hit the wall, debt crises were generally thought of as a problem that happened only in poorer nations. It is understandable that many observers, at least initially, wondered if the Greek crisis was the leading edge of a broader attack by bond vigilantes.\n\nBut UK debt was clearly far smaller relative to the economy than Greece\u2019s \u2013 and it became obvious early on that contagion from the Greek debt crisis was restricted to eurozone nations. So there was no reason to continue believing that the UK risked \u201cbecoming Greece\u201d, as many politicians recklessly claimed at the time.\n\nIn fact, it soon became clear that even the eurozone crisis was more a matter of market panic than one of fundamentally unsustainable levels of debt. As the economist Paul De Grauwe has said, nations with debts in another country\u2019s currency can suffer something similar to a bank run: panicked investors seeking to pull out their funds can cause a government to run out of cash, forcing it into default. Nations that borrow in their own currency are not vulnerable to such a self-fulfilling crisis, because they can in effect print money in a crunch.\n\nThis analysis was validated in 2012 when Mario Draghi, the president of the European Central Bank (ECB), said three words: \u201cWhatever it takes.\u201d This was taken to mean that the ECB would, if necessary, supply cash to governments facing a market panic. And suddenly the euro \u201cdebt\u201d crisis faded away, with investors demanding much lower interest rates on the debt of Italy, Spain and so on.\n\nSince Britain has not adopted the euro and had debts in its own currency, it was not vulnerable to this kind of cash crisis.\n\nThe bottom line is that there was no pressing economic need to slash spending in the face of high unemployment. I would argue that the best way to explain Britain\u2019s austerity is not economic but sociological.\n\nSociology? I used to talk about the push for austerity being led by Very Serious People (a term I borrowed from the blogger Duncan Black). This was not really a joke: if you spend any time consorting with members of the global policy elite, you realise that many of them are driven primarily by the desire to appear \u201cserious\u201d. In economic terms, this usually means pushing policies that will cause significant hardship \u2013 to other people, of course.\n\nThe obsession with perceived seriousness reflects peer pressure, but in some ways also reflects personal careerism. Officials in democratic nations cannot expect to remain in office for more than a few years. What do they do next? If they have lobbied for \u201cserious\u201d policies, they can have a bright future giving speeches at Davos about the importance of making \u201ctough choices\u201d. Or they might even end up employed by the financial industry to lobby their former colleagues \u2013 where a reputation for \u201cseriousness\u201d is a prerequisite, no matter how much damage those policies have caused. (Indeed, Osborne has done both.)\n\nSociology partly explains the Conservative embrace of austerity. But there was also political calculation. Denunciations of debt and deficits often go hand in hand with demands for smaller government, in particular a shrunken welfare state. In effect, politicians whose real goal is to move policy to the right exploit fear of deficits to push an agenda that would be deeply unpopular if stated openly. The Oxford economist Simon Wren-Lewis calls this the \u201cdeficit deceit\u201d hypothesis. The deceit aspect is especially obvious in the US, where Republican leaders routinely denounce deficits while pushing for budget-busting tax cuts. But there is every reason to believe that the same kind of cynicism played an important role in UK austerity.\n\nIt turns out, however, that exploiting debt fears to engineer cuts in public spending tends not to work out quite the way that small-government advocates hope.\n\nWhat serious conservatives \u2013 they do exist \u2013 want is a less generous social safety net, with fewer income transfers to households, while governments concentrate on those functions that only government can perform. I do not share that desire, but never mind. What is important is that voters do not share that desire: cutting direct financial aid is deeply unpopular.\n\nWhat does this have to do with deficit deceit? Even when a government manages to build support for spending cuts by scaring the public about debt and deficits, it generally finds itself shying away from spending cuts that will directly affect families\u2019 incomes. Instead, it tries to save money by shortchanging public investment and public services, a strategy that seems preferable because the consequences of these spending cuts may not be all that visible in the short run.\n\nBut the effects of inadequate public investment cumulate over time, so that a fiscal strategy advertised as an exercise in responsibility ends up being deeply irresponsible, leading to crumbling infrastructure and deteriorating public services. This is how Cameron and Osborne\u2019s error has compounded over the past decade.\n\nConsider the NHS. I am clearly not an expert on the system, and I am sure that the NHS\u2019s problems have multiple causes. But it is obvious to an outsider that direct public provision of healthcare, while it has major advantages, creates a special form of political vulnerability.\n\nCompare the NHS with single-payer systems \u2013 including Medicare, which serves older Americans \u2013 in which the government pays the bills but does not employ the doctors or operate the hospitals. An attempt to save money by underfunding Medicare would provoke an immediate public outcry \u2013 in fact, false rumours of such a move created an outcry in 2010. But a government can underfund the NHS for years before the consequences become obvious to voters, and by that time the crisis can be very hard to fix.\n\nTo sum up: a decade ago, the main critique of austerity was macroeconomic \u2013 it was holding back recovery from the severe recession that followed the global financial crisis. And it did. But that was not the end of the story. Austerity also gradually undermined public services, including healthcare.\n\nWhat will a Labour government do to reverse this damage? There are two reasons to worry it will fall short.\n\nFirst, the era of Conservative austerity coincided with an era of low interest rates and substantial excess capacity, exactly the conditions under which Britain should have been investing in its future. The current environment is much less favourable.\n\nSecond, Labour\u2019s stated plans lack any ambition to reverse austerity. In the US, the Biden administration came in with bold plans and managed to accomplish a significant fraction of them despite having only a razor-thin congressional majority. I am not hearing anything comparable from Labour, even though Keir Starmer seems on course to have political capital beyond the wildest dreams of US progressives.\n\nI hope to be proved wrong. But right now it looks as though the shadow of austerity policies adopted in error 14 years ago will continue to darken Britain\u2019s prospects for many years to come.",

        "body": "With historic heatwaves sweeping across the US and other parts of the northern hemisphere, June is expected to be the 13th consecutive month of record-breaking global temperatures. The primary cause, of course, is the enormous amount of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere. Despite the existential threat posed by rising atmospheric concentrations of greenhouse gases, emissions continue to increase at a faster pace than previously anticipated.\n\nOn one front, however, progress in the fight against the climate crisis has exceeded expectations. Amid the global shift from internal combustion engines to electric vehicles and the accelerated adoption of solar and wind power, demand for renewable energy is rapidly rising in the US and the EU.\n\nThis increased demand has been fuelled by significant declines in the real prices of solar panels, wind turbines, batteries, and EVs. In the US, this can be attributed in part to the clean-energy subsidies included in President Joe Biden\u2019s Inflation Reduction Act and, more significantly, to low-cost Chinese imports.\n\nAlarmingly, new tariffs imposed by the US and the EU on imports of solar panels, EVs, and other equipment, threaten to derail this progress. While estimating the cost of the clean energy transition is a difficult task, even conceptually, the global electricity sector alone is projected to require $3.5tn in capital investment annually between 2021 and 2050. Western countries have demanded that China pay its fair share of these costs, but their own trade policies are starkly at odds with their objectives.\n\nAlthough the disproportionate targeting of cleantech imports from China dates back more than a decade, the trend accelerated significantly under former US president Donald Trump and has continued under Biden. In May, the Biden administration imposed a 100% tariff on Chinese EVs, along with new levies on a range of other Chinese goods, including solar cells and lithium-ion batteries.\n\nThese measures aim to protect American workers and critical domestic industries. But they risk undermining the administration\u2019s climate agenda, particularly its efforts to raise the share of renewables to 100% of US electricity by 2035 and the share of EVs to 50% of new car sales by 2030.\n\nThe new US tariffs could extend beyond China\u2019s national borders. In response to western tariffs, some Chinese manufacturers have moved to south-east Asia in recent years. Earlier this month, the US International Trade Commission decided to investigate claims by American solar-cell companies seeking to impose countervailing and anti-dumping duties on south-east Asian manufacturers. This decision comes despite opposition from US solar-power developers who rely on imported equipment for domestic production.\n\nMeanwhile, the European Commission has imposed provisional tariffs on Chinese EVs after an eight-month investigation found that China\u2019s \u201cunfair subsidisation\u201d of its EV industry undercuts EU competitors. The new EU tariffs, while not prohibitive, average 31%, which is substantially higher than the duties on conventional car imports from other trading partners.\n\nTo be sure, while historically low labour costs and economies of scale have helped reduce the price of Chinese solar panels and EVs, generous government subsidies \u2013 often in the form of cheap credit \u2013 have also played a significant role. But it remains unclear how blocking these low-cost imports, as many western politicians propose, would benefit workers and consumers in the US and the EU. Do American and European policymakers prefer that their own taxpayers, instead of Chinese citizens, bear the costs of clean-energy subsidies? Recall that western countries wanted China to pay its fair share of the energy transition.\n\nAdmittedly, promoting climate policies by emphasising their potential to create green jobs for domestic workers could be an effective political strategy. But we should recognise that these arguments are political, not economic.\n\nskip past newsletter promotion Sign up to First Thing Free daily newsletter Our US morning briefing breaks down the key stories of the day, telling you what\u2019s happening and why it matters Enter your email address Sign up Privacy Notice: Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Similarly, some EV production jobs would disappear if tariffs led to higher prices for battery imports. Meanwhile, many export jobs would be cut when China and other countries inevitably retaliate against western restrictions.\n\nWith US unemployment at 4%, policymakers and voters are now more concerned about inflation than jobs. Removing tariffs is the surest way for western governments to lower energy and transportation prices, thereby reducing inflation. This is yet another example of how international trade could lower the costs of the clean-energy transition \u2013 if we were to embrace it.\n\nJeffrey Frankel is a professor of capital formation and growth at Harvard University. He served as a member of President Bill Clinton\u2019s Council of Economic Advisers.\n\n\u00a9 Project Syndicate",
        "summary": "In the US, this can be attributed in part to the clean-energy subsidies included in President Joe Biden\u2019s Inflation Reduction Act and, more significantly, to low-cost Chinese imports.\nIn May, the Biden administration imposed a 100% tariff on Chinese EVs, along with new levies on a range of other Chinese goods, including solar cells and lithium-ion batteries.\nIn response to western tariffs, some Chinese manufacturers have moved to south-east Asia in recent years.\nMeanwhile, the European Commission has imposed provisional tariffs on Chinese EVs after an eight-month investigation found that China\u2019s \u201cunfair subsidisation\u201d of its EV industry undercuts EU competitors.\nThe new EU tariffs, while not prohibitive, average 31%, which is substantially higher than the duties on conventional car imports from other trading partners.",

        "title": "A Debate Cheat Sheet for Business",
        "body": "Talking points\n\nAll eyes will be on CNN at 9 p.m. Eastern, when President Biden and Donald Trump face off in their first debate since 2020. Among the keenest watchers will be executives and investors looking for signs about how the candidates might handle the economy and business in a second term.\n\nThere will be plenty to scrutinize in the 90-minute, audience-free debate, including what the candidates say and how they say it. Here\u2019s what we will be looking out for. (And, for a lighter take, check out our debate \u201cbingo card\u201d further below.)\n\nThe economy is the big question. Various measures show strong growth under Biden, but many voters feel differently. What will Biden and Trump say about some of the key issues?\n\nInflation: This is clearly a challenge for the president, as Americans complain about what they\u2019re paying in the grocery store, at the pump and on their rent. Biden can say that price increases are slowing down, and will most likely emphasize his administration\u2019s efforts to crack down on \u201ccorporate greed,\u201d like taking on so-called junk fees. Trump will probably stress how good things were when he took office in 2017 \u2014 an economy many Americans want back.\n\nTaxes: Biden\u2019s proposals for higher corporate taxes will hit profits: \u201cIt\u2019s simple math,\u201d David Bahnsen, the founder and chief investment officer of the Bahnsen Group, told DealBook. Many business leaders don\u2019t like Biden\u2019s plan to increase taxes on the wealthy, either. Trump will probably stress his desire to extend his 2017 tax cuts and lower the corporate rate to 20 percent. But questions about corporate earnings and the economy may eclipse those concerns.\n\nProtectionism: Both candidates want to increase tariffs on Chinese goods, but Biden has been more targeted in how he has done it during his presidency. Trump has proposed significantly higher across-the-board levies, though it\u2019s unclear how serious he is about it. Economists have warned that Trump\u2019s potential approach could aggravate inflation and hurt the economy.\n\nMarkets: The S&P 500 set 31 records this year; investors will hope neither party messes with that momentum. In Thursday night\u2019s debate, \u201cmarkets probably care more about presentation than policy pledges,\u201d Paul Donovan, an economist at UBS, wrote in a client note. Biden may have a slight edge, he added, since investors would prefer keeping \u201csome continuity.\u201d\n\nOther issues will probably feature prominently. Biden will most likely raise abortion rights, a topic that has helped Democrats win in recent elections. Trump will almost certainly speak a lot about immigration, perhaps his most potent issue \u2014 and one that many, including Elon Musk, say is a failure of Biden\u2019s.\n\nThe intangibles will matter. Executives told DealBook that C.E.O.s will be paying attention to how Biden and Trump perform:\n\nFor Biden, 81, an important issue for business leaders and many voters is whether he is still fit to serve. A sharp, forceful performance could go a ways in quieting any concerns.\n\nFor Trump, 78, competence is a question as well. But his demeanor will also be under scrutiny, especially if he comes across as overly abrasive or erratic. Some executives said their feelings would come down to whether they can stomach another four years of a Trump presidency.\n\nThere\u2019s also the show around the show. Trump has suggested that his potential running mate would be in Atlanta for the debate. The Times reports that his list is narrowing, with Senator J.D. Vance of Ohio, Gov. Doug Burgum of North Dakota and Senator Marco Rubio of Florida being of particular interest.",

        "body": "(Bloomberg) -- The growing prospect of a Trump presidential victory is making yield curve steepeners an attractive bet as growth will likely slow and inflation quicken under such a scenario, according to Morgan Stanley.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg\n\nThe US presidential debate has strengthened the possibility of Donald Trump\u2019s re-election, and this will sharpen the focus on the former president\u2019s immigration and tariff policies, the bank\u2019s strategists wrote in a June 29 note. Bond traders are bracing for a similar outcome, with the yield discount of 10-year notes over two-year securities shrinking the most since January last week.\n\n\u201cThere has been a clear relative shift in the probabilities of President Trump winning over President Biden\u201d since the debate, Morgan Stanley strategists including Matthew Hornbach and Guneet Dhingra wrote in the note. \u201cThe sharp shift of probabilities in favor of President Trump may be a unique catalyst that makes curve steepeners attractive.\u201d\n\nThe recalibration in bets may complicate the outlook for the US government bond market after it capped a two-month winning streak last week. Traders are pricing in the risk of slower growth and faster inflation as Trump has vowed to deport undocumented immigrants and ramped up threats of increased tariffs against China.\n\n\u201cThe market now has to contend with rising probabilities of changes in immigration and tariff policies in an economy where growth has already been cooling, making the market more likely\u201d to price in more US interest-rate cuts, the strategists wrote. \u201cHigher prospects of a Republican sweep, amid growing focus on deficits, could put upward pressure on long-end term premiums.\u201d\n\nThe strategists recommended adding two-year/20-year steepeners in Treasuries.\n\nHigher tariffs and the possible deportation of migrants would both be negative for US economic growth, Morgan Stanley analysts said in a presentation last month. The hit to the economy would likely encourage the Federal Reserve to cut interest rates, reducing short-term yields.\n\nThe Congressional Budget Office has estimated that immigration will generate a $7 trillion boost to gross domestic product over the next decade.\n\nUS Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen said last month that Trump\u2019s proposed tariffs would raise costs for consumers and weigh on American businesses. Faster inflation would be bad news for longer-maturity debt as it diminishes the value of their fixed payments over time.\n\nStory continues\n\nThe outcome of the presidential debate has triggered a flurry of calls from analysts on how to position for a Trump victory. For its part, Barclays Plc is recommending that investors buy inflation hedges in the US Treasury market.\n\nNomura Securities Co.\u2019s Naokazu Koshimizu sees a Trump administration favoring fiscal expansion and a weak dollar. This, along with the preference for a dovish Federal Reserve chair, would lead to a steeper US yield curve.\n\n\u201cIt would be difficult to cover the fiscal expansion in the event of a Trump administration with additional tariffs alone, and the possibility of issuing more bonds will increase,\u201d the Nomura senior rates strategist wrote in a note Monday. \u201cIf inflation flares up again and the Fed policy rate remains high, an increase in interest payments is also expected to lead to a wider fiscal deficit.\u201d\n\n(Updates with Morgan Stanley economist\u2019 views in seventh paragraph, CBO\u2019s estimates in eighth paragraph and background in ninth paragraph.

        "body": "Will Biden's green jobs policy help him win votes?\n\n12 hours ago By Michelle Fleury , North America Business correspondent Share\n\nBBC Qcells is investing billions in a solar panel factory in Georgia\n\nThe former \u201ccarpet capital of the world\u201d is getting a multi-billion-dollar makeover. Here in the rural Georgian town of Dalton, once known for its fabric floor coverings, a Korean company called Qcells is spending $2.5bn (\u00a32bn) to expand its solar panel factory, with another in the works. It's a bold initiative that will create 2,500 quality jobs in the next 12 months, in an area where the average household income is roughly 27% below the national average. It is hoped the project will revitalise a corner of the US whose glory days seemed over. And it's due in no small part to someone many of the residents of this Republican district would rather not credit - Joe Biden. The president's landmark 2022 Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) \u2013 his signature green legislation - offered hundreds of billions of dollars in tax incentives, credits and loans to stimulate American manufacturing in clean energy.\n\nThe most ambitious climate legislation in US history has generated a tsunami of private sector investments, with big implications for the rest of the world. And Georgia - a state President Biden hopes is in play in this year\u2019s presidential election - has been a big beneficiary. But with four months before the president goes head-to-head against Donald Trump, the billions of dollars of new investment in this key battleground state doesn\u2019t appear to have lifted the incumbent\u2019s support. President Biden\u2019s pitch is that solving the climate problem is also good for jobs. Since the law was passed, more than 300,000 clean energy jobs have been created in the US, according to the advocacy group Climate Power. And there's no doubt it\u2019s creating opportunities in places like Dalton. Here you see Bidenomics in action - foreign and government money being used to fight climate change and build an economy from the middle out.\n\nQcells' Scott Moskowitz points to the massive investments in US renewables\n\nScott Moskowitz, head of market strategy for Qcells, says that Georgia had been a great home since 2019, but that the IRA had been an \u201caccelerant\u201d. Without it, he muses, the current expansion might not have happened at all. \u201cWhat our industry has seen, since the IRA has passed, is more investment in the past two years in solar and clean energy manufacturing than the previous 20 years,\u201d he says. And yet that message either isn't getting through or simply isn't resonating with locals \u2013 not even local Democrats. Jan Pourquoi, the spokesperson for the local Whitfield County Democratic Party, tells me: \u201cIn the business community, there is a resentment against that company [Qcells].\u201d Mr Pourquoi, a Belgian expat should know. He owns one of the small carpet firms in town. We spoke in his office, overlooking the factory floor where they turn flooring remnants into small rugs. \u201cThe business community resents the fact that we have a company from South Korea coming in this area with government subsidies, while they themselves get nothing from the government,\u201d says Mr Pourquoi, who identified as a Republican before switching parties following Trump\u2019s election in 2016. He tells me that local voters know little about the IRA law. \u201cNobody cares about clean energy, not around here. That is the type of stuff that I would call the \u2018latte liberals\u2019 care about in the big city.\u201d\n\nQcells Qcells has been expanding its vast factory in Dalton\n\nWell, at least one person does, and that's Marjorie Taylor Greene, the firebrand Republican congressional representative for the district. She has touted Qcells' expansion, despite voting against the law that helped make it possible. It\u2019s creating some awkward dynamics for Republicans. The IRA is in Donald Trump\u2019s sights. If Republican lawmakers win big in the Congressional elections that are also taking place on 5 November, then portions of President Biden\u2019s signature climate law could be repealed, threatening a clean energy boom happening in their communities across the US. I sat down for coffee with Kasey Carpenter, Dalton\u2019s Republican member in the Georgia House of Representatives. We met at Oakwood Caf\u00e9, the bustling diner he owns along with a string of other local businesses, including a pizza joint and a boutique hotel. Mr Carpenter downplayed the potential impact on Qcells of manufacturing tax credits being rolled back. He doesn\u2019t think it would jeopardise the solar investments in his district. But he adds that if clean energy investments were to become at risk \u201cI\u2019m sure we\u2019ll be speaking with the Trump team\u201d. Our conversation ends with him saying it would be another feather in Dalton\u2019s cap if this carpet town could also lay claim to the title of \u201csolar panel capital of the world\u201d.\n\nBut that belongs to China, which controls 80% of the world\u2019s solar panel supply chain. For years China has been investing heavily in renewable energy, and is expected to spend a staggering $675bn in 2024, according to an International Energy Agency (IEA) report. To compete, governments around the world have begun throwing hundreds of billions at the green industries of the future. In the EU, investment in clean energy is set to increase to $370bn in 2024, according to the IEA. The predicted figure for the US is $315bn. US Trade Representative Katherine Tai said last year that she hoped the US\u2019s increased spending on renewable energy would help address the \u201csignificant distortion\u201d in the global economy caused by China.\n\nKasey Carpenter, a Republican, says he is not fearful that a possible Trump government would hit the solar sector",

        "body": "marketlan/iStock via Getty Images\n\nIntroduction\n\nMost of my articles are about \"big picture\" developments. I'm not only doing this to use them as a foundation for stock picks but also because I believe that discussing major developments is sometimes more important than discussing individual stock picks.\n\nI also want to provide value for people who may not like my stock picks to have info for their own stock selection.\n\nSome big-picture developments we have frequently discussed are (some more than others):\n\nThe energy bull case.\n\nArtificial intelligence.\n\nA top-heavy S&P 500.\n\nInflation.\n\nSupply chain re-shoring.\n\nBiden/Biden picks.\n\nGreen transition.\n\nNeedless to say, a lot of these topics are in some way related. This includes the impact of artificial intelligence on energy demand and the composition of the S&P 500, which is something I want to discuss in this article.\n\nThe S&P 500 just exited the first half of this year. It returned 14%, which is the second-best first-half performance this century.\n\nSpeaking of this century, the number of record highs (31) in the first half of this year is also the second-highest number this century.\n\nBloomberg\n\nSince the lows on October 12, 2022, the market has added $16 trillion in value, most of it coming from technology and communications services. The same goes for the first six months of this year.\n\nBloomberg\n\nWhat's interesting is Nvidia (NVDA) was a huge outlier, adding more than 200 points to the S&P 500 in the first half, with a number of \"big guys\" adding more than 40% year-to-date.\n\nBloomberg\n\nWhile this is great for people who simply own the S&P 500, it has created a very unusual situation, as the equal-weight S&P 500 has underperformed the market-weighted S&P 500 (the \"normal\" S&P 500) by the widest margin in the first six months of a year ever.\n\nThis is what the underperformance of the equal-weighted S&P 500 compared to the S&P 500 since October 12, 2022, looks like:\n\nBloomberg\n\nAs of June 27, the biggest six companies in the S&P 500 account for 31.4% of the S&P 500!\n\nThese companies are Microsoft (MSFT), Apple (AAPL), Nvidia, Amazon (AMZN), Meta Platforms (META), and Alphabet (GOOGL).\n\nWhat do these companies have in common?\n\nThey all have turned into AI plays.\n\nDon't get me wrong, I'm not \"hating\" on these companies. They all have phenomenal products, pristine balance sheets, and bright futures.\n\nThe problem I see is diversification. The S&P 500's purpose is to offer diversified exposure. Right now, it has turned into an AI play, with most sectors lagging behind.\n\nIf the AI rally runs into trouble, the S&P 500 is likely poised to underperform - especially because it is now valued at 21x earnings, indicating subdued returns in the years ahead (see the chart below).\n\nJPMorgan\n\nAgain, I'm not making the case the AI rally is over. This is simply a risk/reward assessment. As much as I believe AI enthusiasm was justified, it's not something that will last forever, especially because expectations are now sky-high.\n\nHowever, this does not mean the average investor is now looking at a high likelihood of subdued returns in the years ahead.\n\nBecause the S&P 500's surge was mainly fueled by tech, a lot of companies have been left in the dust - often with great valuations and potential.\n\nIn this article, I'll present three dividend stocks that all trade at very attractive valuations, have great business models, and come with either high income or consistent dividend growth.\n\nI own one of them and have the other two on my watchlist.\n\nNorfolk Southern (NSC) - A Struggling Giant With Tremendous Potential\n\nNorfolk Southern was one of the first dividend stocks I bought, as I wanted to own a company with a good dividend growth track record, an ultra-wide moat, and the ability to benefit from secular growth like economic re-shoring.\n\nRegarding its moat, headquartered in Atlanta, Georgia, Norfolk Southern is one of America's largest Class I railroads, which enjoys a duopoly with its peer CSX Corp. (CSX) in the Eastern third of the United States.\n\nAssociation of American Railroads\n\nBecause of its dominant position, it enjoys a very wide moat, which is one of the reasons why it has consistently outperformed the S&P 500 and most non-rail transportation peers.\n\nUnfortunately, the company's stock has been lackluster since early 2022, when it started to encounter a number of headwinds, including weaker economic growth, falling consumer sentiment (NSC is a major intermodal railroad), a derailment in East Palestine, Ohio, and ongoing operating challenges.\n\nData by YCharts\n\nIn other words, the company has somewhat lost its way, which was reflected in poor 1Q24 earnings, when the company reported 2% lower revenues, 1% higher expenses, and 6% lower operating income - adjusted for the East Palestine derailment.\n\nNorfolk Southern Corporation\n\nIt now has an operating ratio of 69.9%, which is a horrible result.\n\nWith that said, I am a buyer of NSC, as I am a big fan of buying undervalued stocks with turnaround potential - especially in critical supply chains.\n\nPressured by activist investors, NSC is working hard to turn its business around, which includes cutting costs and improving rail operations.\n\nOur strategy is designed to mirror the great success stories of the Canadian railroads who have recognized that PSR is about more than tearing a railroad down to its studs at slashing costs regardless of the fallout. As our Board member, Claude Mageau demonstrated when he was CEO of Canadian National, a PSR operating model, when part of a customer-focused balanced strategy, can deliver top-tier revenue growth and a sub-60 operating ratio. - NSC 1Q24 Earnings Call\n\nNorfolk Southern Corporation\n\nIf the company is able to lower its operating ratio to 66% by the end of this year, it could massively improve investor confidence.\n\nAs we turn to the balance of the year, we will see our margins improve materially from here. We are finally starting to see excess service costs unwind and they will accelerate downward in Q2. That trajectory, along with the reduction in non-agreement headcount as well as other productivity initiatives leave us confident in a strong productivity story for Q2. - NSC 1Q24 Earnings Call\n\nWhile I wait for this turnaround to get support from better economic growth, I enjoy a 2.5% dividend. This may not be a juicy yield. However, it comes with a 46% payout ratio and a five-year CAGR of 10.2%.\n\nOver the past ten years, this dividend has risen by 137%. The share count has been reduced by 27%.\n\nData by YCharts\n\nCurrently, NSC trades at a blended P/E ratio of 18.2x.\n\nAnalysts expect a 1% EPS recovery in 2024, potentially followed by 17% and 14% growth in 2025 and 2026, respectively.\n\nFAST Graphs\n\nThis paves the way for a fair price target of $275, 28% above its current price.\n\nOn a longer-term basis, I'm much more bullish, as I expect NSC to go back to its old glory, especially if it gets a much-needed tailwind from economic growth.\n\nWhile I have been buying gradually, I'm going to be a much more aggressive buyer *if* NSC drops to or below $200.\n\nZoetis (ZTS) - Undervalued Dividend Growth\n\nZoetis has become one of my favorite healthcare stocks. The former Pfizer (PFE) spin-off has become the world's largest producer of vaccines, medicines, diagnostics, and similar for animals.\n\nZoetis Inc.\n\nThe company's portfolio covers eight core species and seven therapeutic areas and holds 15 blockbuster drugs among roughly 300 product lines.\n\nWith regard to patent loss risks, the average market life of key brands in its portfolio is 30 years, including anti-infectives, dermatology, vaccines, pain and sedation, and others.\n\nZoetis Inc.\n\nWhat matters is that the company holds the number one market share in:\n\nNorth America, Latin America, and Asia.\n\nDermatology and pet pain.\n\nCompanion animals, cattle, and fish.\n\nIt has also consistently outperformed its peers, growing revenues by 8% annually since its IPO in 2013.\n\nZoetis Inc.\n\nThrough 2033, the company expects to maintain consistent growth, as it believes its total addressable market will grow by 4-6% annually to at least $75 billion by 2033.\n\nZoetis Inc.\n\nIt also has consistently grown its margins, which boosted adjusted net income by 109% in the 2017-2023 period.\n\nZoetis Inc.\n\nWith that said, ZTS is down 12% year-to-date, which was triggered by the news that its arthritis drug, Librela, could be harmful. I discussed this in an article published on April 14, when I went with the title \"Despite Lawsuit Risks: Why Zoetis Remains A Completing Investment.\"\n\nSince then, shares have rebounded 15%, beating the 6% return of the S&P 500.\n\nWhile lawsuit risks are always an issue in healthcare, I believe these fears are overblown, allowing investors to buy ZTS at attractive prices.\n\nCurrently yielding 1.0%, Zoetis comes with a payout ratio of 29% and a five-year CAGR of 22.7%. It also has outperformed the market by a wide margin over the past ten years.\n\nData by YCharts\n\nMoreover, the company, which enjoys anti-cyclical demand, is currently trading at a blended P/E ratio of 31.3x, which is slightly below its normalized P/E ratio of 31.7x. While this may seem like a lofty valuation, analysts expect 8-10% annual EPS growth to last, potentially paving the road for 10-11% annual returns.\n\nFAST Graphs\n\nAs such, I stick to my buy rating and believe ZTS offers a great risk/reward for dividend growth investors seeking healthcare exposure in a market with strong long-term secular tailwinds.\n\nWith that said, if you're looking for a higher yield, the next pick may be for you.\n\nSuncor Energy (SU) - A Dirt-Cheap Canadian Oil Play\n\nSuncor is the largest peer of my investment in Canadian Natural Resources (CNQ). The company is one of the largest operators in Canada's oil sands and one of my favorite picks for income and capital gains.\n\nThe company has a number of benefits that I'm looking for in an oil company, which include deep reserves (more than 25 years of low-cost reserves), efficient operations in oil sands, and an increasing focus on shareholder distributions.\n\nSuncor Energy\n\nMy most recent article on Suncor was written on May 19, when I called it \"One Of My Best Ideas In Energy.\" Since then, it held a special call in May when it presented its long-term outlook.\n\nDuring this call, it committed to an additional C$3.3 billion per year in free cash flow by the end of 2026, which translates to significant cash generation and shareholder returns.\n\nThis improvement comes with a targeted reduction in the company's WTI breakeven by $10 per barrel, which massively improves its free cash flow potential.\n\nSuncor Energy\n\nMoreover, it has revised its net debt target for its 100% free cash flow payout to C$8 billion. That is down from C$9 billion. As I wrote in my prior article, expectations are for C$8.6 billion in net debt by the end of this year, which makes it likely that Suncor will reach its debt target next year.\n\nThis bodes well for shareholders, as the company aims to deliver over C$40 billion of AFFO (adjusted funds from operations) from 2024 to 2026, with a 10% compound annual growth rate, translating to a 15% growth rate on a per-share basis.\n\nSuncor Energy\n\nCurrently yielding 4.2%, the company aims to grow its dividend by 3-5% annually, with most shareholder returns coming from buybacks.\n\nGiven the company's favorable production outlook, in 2026, it could generate north of C$8 billion in free cash flow at $75 WTI. That translates to 12% of its market cap. This bodes very well for buybacks and total returns!\n\nSuncor Energy\n\nWith regard to production, the company plans to increase upstream production by over 100,000 barrels per day while keeping controllable costs flat, which could potentially result in an 8% decline in operating cost per barrel over the next three years.\n\nSuncor Energy\n\nAs I believe oil has much more room to rise than $75 WTI, I consider Suncor to be a \"hidden\" Canadian gem, which is perfect for a wide range of investors, including income and buyback-focused investors.\n\nPlease note that Suncor is listed both in Toronto and New York.\n\nValuation-wise, Suncor currently trades at a blended P/OCF (operating cash flow) ratio of just 5.3x, making it one of the cheapest energy stocks on my radar.\n\nApplying an 8.5x multiple, the company has a fair stock price of C$92 in Toronto, 76% above the current price. The same applies to New York-listed shares.\n\nFAST Graphs\n\nNeedless to say, I believe SU has a lot of room to run the moment energy bulls return, making it one of my top picks in the sector.\n\nTakeaway\n\nThe S&P 500 has surged, mainly driven by tech giants and AI enthusiasm. This concentration poses a risk if the AI boom slows.\n\nIt also left other promising sectors undervalued.\n\nIn this article, we discussed three compelling dividend stocks: Norfolk Southern, Zoetis, and Suncor Energy.\n\nEach offers unique advantages, from Norfolk's potential turnaround in the rail industry and Zoetis's leadership in animal healthcare to Suncor's massive potential in the energy sector.\n\nI believe these picks provide a great risk/reward in the dividend (growth) space and offer value in what has become a very challenging market.",
        "summary": "The S&P 500 just exited the first half of this year.\nBloombergWhile this is great for people who simply own the S&P 500, it has created a very unusual situation, as the equal-weight S&P 500 has underperformed the market-weighted S&P 500 (the \"normal\" S&P 500) by the widest margin in the first six months of a year ever.\nThis is what the underperformance of the equal-weighted S&P 500 compared to the S&P 500 since October 12, 2022, looks like:BloombergAs of June 27, the biggest six companies in the S&P 500 account for 31.4% of the S&P 500!\nSince then, shares have rebounded 15%, beating the 6% return of the S&P 500.\nTakeawayThe S&P 500 has surged, mainly driven by tech giants and AI enthusiasm.",
