      "            \"body\": \"Tesla\\u2019s global sales fell for the second straight quarter despite price cuts and low-interest financing offers, another sign of weakening demand for the company\\u2019s products and electric vehicles overall.\\n\\nThe Austin, Texas, company said Tuesday that it sold 436,956 vehicles from April through June, down 4.8% from 466,140 sold the same period a year ago. The sales were better than the 436,000 figure that analysts had expected.\\n\\nDemand for EVs worldwide is slowing, but they\\u2019re still growing for most automakers. Tesla, with an aging model lineup and relatively high average selling prices, has struggled more than other manufacturers.\\n\\nStill it retained the title of the world\\u2019s top-selling electric vehicle maker. For the first half of the year, Tesla sold more than 910,000 vehicles worldwide, handily beating China\\u2019s BYD, which sold 726,153.\\n\\nTesla also sold over 33,000 more vehicles during the second quarter than it produced, which should reduce the company\\u2019s inventory on hand at its stores.\\n\\nTesla gave no explanation for the sales decline. The company will post second-quarter earnings on 23 July. The electric automaker\\u2019s sales decline comes as competition is increasing from legacy and startup automakers, which are trying to nibble away at the company\\u2019s market share. Most other automakers will report US sales figures later Tuesday.\\n\\nNearly all of Tesla\\u2019s sales came from the smaller and less-expensive Models 3 and Y, with the company selling only 21,551 of its more expensive models that include X and S, as well as the new Cybertruck.\\n\\nThe sales decline came despite Tesla knocking $2,000 off the prices of three of its five models in the US in April. The company cut the prices of the Model Y, Tesla\\u2019s most popular model and the top-selling electric vehicle in the US, and also of the Models X and S. Also during the quarter, Tesla knocked roughly a third off the price of its \\u201cFull Self Driving\\u201d system \\u2013 which can\\u2019t drive itself and so drivers must remain alert and be ready to intervene.\\n\\nJessica Caldwell, head of insights for Edmunds.com, said Tesla is having trouble in a market where most early adopters already have EVs, and mainstream buyers are more skeptical that electric cars can meet their needs.\\n\\nTesla also has a set of unique problems, mainly a model lineup that doesn\\u2019t look much different than it did years ago, Caldwell said. With Tesla\\u2019s price cuts, used vehicle prices tumbled. Anyone wanting a Tesla can get a far better deal buying a used one, Caldwell said. \\u201cIf you\\u2019re looking at monthly payments, it\\u2019s hard to compete against,\\u201d she said.\\n\\nCaldwell doesn\\u2019t see any big catalyst this year that would boost Tesla sales unless gasoline prices spike. The new Cybertruck is being sold only in small numbers, and the rest of the lineup is old. \\u201cMost people would be hard pressed to figure out which one is the newer one and which one is the older one,\\u201d she said.\\n\\nWedbush analyst Dan Ives wrote in a note to investors on Tuesday that second-quarter sales were a \\u201chuge comeback performance\\u201d for Tesla. \\u201cIn a nutshell, the worst is in the rearview mirror for Tesla,\\u201d he wrote.

      "            \"body\": \"Boeing to get 'sweetheart deal' - victims' lawyer\\n\\n2 days ago By Jo\\u00e3o da Silva , Business reporter Share\\n\\nGetty Images A lawyer representing families of victims of two fatal Boeing 737 Max crashes says they \\\"strenuously object to this plea deal\\\"\\n\\nA lawyer representing victims of two fatal Boeing 737 Max crashes has told the BBC that the US government is preparing to offer the plane maker a \\\"sweetheart plea deal\\\". Paul Cassell, who says he got the information \\\"directly from the Justice Department\\\", added that the deal includes a small fine, three years of probation and independent safety audits. Boeing did not immediately reply to the BBC's request for comment, while the Justice Department (DoJ) declined to provide a statement. It comes as Boeing announced it had reached a deal to buy the aerospace supplier Spirit AeroSystems - a move it said would improve quality and safety. Spirit made the fuselage that suffered a mid-flight blowout on an Alaska Airlines 737 Max 9 jet in January, sparking widespread concern about standards at Boeing.\\n\\n'Families will object to this deal'\\n\\nLast month, US prosecutors recommended that the DoJ bring criminal charges against the plane maker. That was after the DoJ said Boeing had violated a 2021 settlement related to the crashes which killed 346 people. \\\"The memory of 346 innocents killed by Boeing demands more justice than this,\\\" said Mr Cassell, adding that the \\\"families will strenuously object to this plea deal\\\". The plane crashes - both involving Boeing's 737 Max aircraft - occurred within six months of each other. The crash involving Indonesia's Lion Air occurred in October 2018, followed by an Ethiopian Airlines flight in March 2019. Both crashes were linked to faulty flight control systems. A letter sent last month by Mr Cassell to the DoJ revealed that the families had been seeking prosecutions of Boeing's top executives at the time of the crashes and a fine of $24.8bn (\\u00a319.6bn) for \\\"the deadliest corporate crime in US history\\\". The Justice Department has until 7 July to decide whether to revive a criminal charge of fraud brought against Boeing in 2021. That charge has lain dormant since the company acknowledged in a settlement that it had misled air-safety regulators about aspects of the 737 Max, and promised to create a new compliance system to detect and prevent further fraud. Under the deal reached in 2021, Boeing said it would pay a $2.5bn settlement and prosecutors agreed to ask the court to drop a criminal charge after three years if the company abided by certain stipulations set out in the deferred prosecution agreement. But in May, the DoJ said Boeing was in breach of the deal, stating that it had failed to \\\"design, implement, and enforce a compliance and ethics program to prevent and detect violations of the US fraud laws throughout its operations\\\".\",\n",

      "            \"body\": \"In this article RIVN Follow your favorite stocks CREATE FREE ACCOUNT\\n\\n2025 Rivian R1S Rivian\\n\\nA Thursday investor event for Rivian Automotive that focused on cost-cutting efforts, efficiency gains and in-house technologies and software wasn't enough to build on the company's significant share growth this week. Shares of the all-electric vehicle startup fell by about 2% to 6% for much of the event, eating into some of its 23% gain in shares the day before on news of an up to $5 billion investment by Volkswagen Group . Rivian's stock closed Thursday down 1.8% to $14.47 per share, off by roughly 39% year to date amid investor concerns regarding cash burn and a slowdown in EV sales. Rivian on Thursday reconfirmed its 2024 guidance that included production of 57,000 vehicles and a path to positive gross profit during the fourth quarter, including regulatory credits. It also outlined longer-term growths, such as plans to achieve positive adjusted earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization in 2027. \\\"Everything that you're hearing from us, around our product, around how we're running the business, around how we're driving toward profitability, my hope is that you're seeing really an extreme sense of urgency,\\\" Rivian CEO RJ Scaringe said during the event. \\\"We're very, very fast driving towards the improvements necessary to get to positive free cash flow and, before that, positive margins this year.\\\"\\n\\nStock Chart Icon Stock chart icon Rivian's stock performance\\n\\nRivian also outlined long-term financial targets of a roughly 25% gross margin, 10% free cash flow and adjusted profit margin in the \\\"high teens.\\\" The company did not release a time frame for these targets. Scaringe spent much of his time during the roughly four-hour presentation discussing efficiencies in products and manufacturing, which he said are expected to lead to 20% material cost reductions in its current vehicles, followed by 45% targeted reductions in its upcoming \\\"R2\\\" vehicles, which are projected to begin production in early 2026. The reductions range from physical savings, such as a 54% decrease in design costs of its R2 vehicles compared with current models, to lower costs on more complex systems such as battery packs and electrical hardware. For example, the company is using 10 fewer in-house electronic control units, or ECUs, in its recently redesigned R1 vehicles, allowing it to remove 1.6 miles in wiring harness length and 44 pounds out of the vehicle. Rivian's software expertise is at the center of VW's plans to invest $5 billion in the automaker by 2026, including an anticipated joint venture between the companies to create electrical architecture and software technology. Volkswagen is expected to use Rivian's electrical architecture and software stack for vehicles beginning in the second half of the decade, Scaringe said during the investment announcement. He said the joint venture does not include anything with battery technologies, vehicle propulsion platforms, high voltage systems or autonomy and electrical hardware.\\n\\nA provided image of Oliver Blume, CEO of Volkswagen Group and RJ Scaringe, founder and CEO of Rivian, as the companies announce joint venture plans on June 25, 2024.

A once prolifically successful studio, Pixar has suffered at the box office in the wake of the pandemic. Much of its difficulties have come, in part, because Disney opted to debut a handful of animated features directly on streaming service Disney+ during theatrical closures and even once cinemas had reopened.\\n\\nAs a result, before \\\"Inside Out 2,\\\" no Disney animated feature from Pixar or its Walt Disney Animation studio had generated more than $480 million at the global box office since 2019.\\n\\n\\\"Inside Out 2\\\" has also showcased how vital the family audience is to the box office. This underserved crowd accounted for more than 70% of those in attendance during the film's domestic debut, according to data from EntTelligence.\\n\\nWhile this audience came out in droves for Universal's \\\"The Super Mario Bros. Movie,\\\" which generated more than $1.36 billion at the global box office, there was little for them to feast on until the recent releases of Sony's \\\"The Garfield Movie\\\" and Paramount's \\\"IF.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Inside Out 2\\\" also drove the coveted teen demographic to cinemas, with 14% of foot traffic coming from those aged 13 to 17. This younger generation has been largely absent from the market in recent years.\\n\\nAs the future of moviegoing, this group is particularly important to the industry. Getting them back to the big screen has become a top priority for studios and movie theater operators.\\n\\nNext up for family and teens is Universal and Illumination's \\\"Despicable Me 4,\\\" due out in theaters during the July Fourth holiday weekend.\\n\\nDisclosure: Comcast is the parent company of NBCUniversal and CNBC.\",\n",

      "            \"body\": \"Energy prices fall but relief may be temporary\\n\\n2 days ago By Kevin Peachey , Cost of living correspondent Share\\n\\nGetty Images\\n\\nA drop in domestic gas and electricity prices has now taken effect, but costs are expected to rise again in October. Regulator Ofgem's new price cap for England, Wales and Scotland came into force on Monday, meaning a typical household's energy bill will fall by \\u00a3122 a year. That brings down the bill for a household using a typical amount of gas and electricity to \\u00a31,568 a year, the lowest for two years. But forecasters expect it to rise again in the run-up to winter, more than reversing the latest drop.\\n\\nLeading consultancy Cornwall Insight predicts that a typical household's annual bill will be back up to \\u00a31,723 in October, a \\u00a3155, or 10%, increase from now. \\\"Modest falls in summer look set to be wiped out by bigger rises in autumn when people will need to put the heating back on,\\\" said Adam Scorer, chief executive of charity National Energy Action. \\\"The cost of energy remains an unaffordable luxury that many of the poorest simply cannot afford.\\\" Although the price cap is changed every three months, it is illustrated by Ofgem in terms of an annual bill for a household using a typical amount of gas and electricity. People in larger properties will tend to pay more overall owing to higher energy usage, and those in smaller properties will pay less.\\n\\nThat is because the cap, set by Ofgem, limits the maximum price that can be charged for each unit of gas and electricity - not the total bill. It affects the gas and electricity bills of 28 million households, but does not impact customers in Northern Ireland, where the sector is regulated differently but where prices are also falling.\\n\\nEnergy bills are considerably lower than the peak after Russia's invasion of Ukraine, when the government stepped in to limit bill rises. That has fed through to falls in the general rate of rising prices, known as inflation. However, a typical household's energy bill remains about \\u00a3400 higher than three years ago, prompting debate over the issue during the election campaign.\\n\\nIn addition, households have built up a collective debt to suppliers of about \\u00a33bn owing, primarily, to the pressure from high prices. Those on prepayment meters, who tend to top up meters during the colder, darker months and are often under more financial pressure, will see a less immediate impact of a drop in prices in the summer. The vast majority of households pay by direct debit, and their payments are smoothed out over the year. They should have been contacted by their supplier about the latest price changes. Experts say it is a good idea to take a meter reading now, to ensure billpayers are charged at the correct rate. Ofgem is reviewing the way the price cap is calculated, including sifting through a host of responses to a consultation on standing charges.\\n\\nLatest changes in detail\\n\\nThe new prices that took effect for July to the end of September mean: Gas prices are now capped at 5.48p per kilowatt hour (kWh), and electricity at 22.36p per kWh\\n\\nA typical household uses 2,700 kWh of electricity a year, and 11,500 kWh of gas\\n\\nHouseholds on pre-payment meters pay slightly less than those on direct debit, with a typical bill of \\u00a31,522\\n\\nThose who pay their bills every three months by cash or cheque pay more, with a typical bill of \\u00a31,668\\n\\nStanding charges - a fixed daily charge covering the costs of connecting to a supply - are unchanged at 60p a day for electricity and 31p a day for gas, although they vary by region\\n\\nHow to keep energy use - and bills - down\",\n",

It said it agreed to pay $37.25 a share in Boeing stock for Spirit, giving the plane supplier an equity value of $4.7 billion. Including Spirit's debt the deal has a transaction value of $8.3 billion Boeing said. Spirit's shares closed Friday at $32.87 a share, a market capitalization of about $3.8 billion. Boeing in March disclosed it was in talks to acquire the Wichita, Kansas-based company, weeks after a fuselage panel blew out midair from a nearly new Boeing 737 Max 9 on an Alaska Airlines flight, sparking a fresh crisis for Boeing. Spirit makes the fuselages for the 737 and other parts, including sections of Boeing's 787 Dreamliners. In 2005, Boeing spun off operations in Kansas and Oklahoma that became the present-day Spirit AeroSystems. Boeing accounted for about 70% of Spirit's revenue last year, while roughly a quarter came from making parts for Boeing's main rival, Airbus, according to a securities filing. Boeing CEO Dave Calhoun, who has said he will step down at the end of the year, on Monday said bringing Spirit in-house will \\\"fully align\\\" the companies' production systems and workforces.\\n\\nwatch now\\n\\n\\\"Among the many actions we're taking as a company, this is one of the most significant in demonstrating our unwavering commitment to strengthen quality and make certain that Boeing is the company the world needs it to be,\\\" Calhoun said in a message to employees. He said he expects the deal to close mid-2025, subject to approval by regulators, Spirit shareholders and the sale of Spirit's operations dedicated to Airbus planes. Spirit's CEO, Pat Shanahan, is considered a possible successor for Calhoun. Airbus, meanwhile, said Monday it has reached an agreement with Spirit so that the European aircraft manufacturer is compensated $559 million by Spirit to acquire its manufacturing lines dedicated to Airbus planes. Those include operations in Belfast, Northern Ireland, where the wings and mid-fuselage of the A220 are produced, A220 pylons in Wichita and A350 fuselage sections in North Carolina. Airbus will pay $1 for the assets.\\n\\nMounting pressure\",\n",

      "            \"body\": \"High mortgage rates pricing out buyers, says Nationwide\\n\\n1 day ago By Nick Edser , Business reporter, BBC News Share\\n\\nGetty Images\\n\\nHigh mortgage rates mean affordability is still \\\"stretched\\\" for many home buyers, according to the Nationwide. The building society said that while earnings had been rising faster than house prices in recent years, this had not been enough to offset the impact of more expensive mortgages. Its comments came as it said house price growth had been \\\"broadly stable\\\" in June, with prices up 0.2% from the previous month. The average house price is now \\u00a3266,064, the lender said.\\n\\nPrices were up 1.5% from a year earlier, but Nationwide said activity in the housing market had been \\\"broadly flat\\\" over the past 12 months, with transactions down by about 15% compared with 2019. The lender said the market was still being affected by the increase in mortgage rates, which started climbing after the Bank of England began to raise its key interest rate in late 2021. Robert Gardner, Nationwide's chief economist, said that mortgage rates are \\\"still well above the record lows prevailing in 2021 in the wake of the pandemic\\\". \\\"For example, the interest rate on a five-year fixed rate mortgage for a borrower with a 25% deposit was 1.3% in late 2021, but in recent months this has been nearer to 4.7%. \\\"As a result, housing affordability is still stretched.\\\" Nationwide's figures are based on the building society's own mortgage lending, which does not include buyers who purchase homes with cash, or buy-to-let deals. Cash buyers account for about a third of housing sales. The impact of higher borrowing costs can be seen in the fact that transactions involving a mortgage are down by nearly 25% over the past year, Nationwide said. Meanwhile the number of cash transactions for properties is about 5% higher than pre-pandemic levels. Across the UK, Northern Ireland saw the biggest price increases, up 4.1% from a year earlier. Wales and Scotland both saw a 1.4% annual rise. Prices in England climbed by 0.6%, with northern regions seeing bigger increases in general than the south.\\n\\nDespite some major lenders cutting their mortgage rates last week, home loan costs remain far higher than pre-pandemic levels. According to financial information service Moneyfacts, the average rate on a two-year fixed mortgage deal stands at 5.95%, while for a five-year deal the average is 5.53%. The focus is now on the Bank of England's Monetary Policy Committee (MPC), which sets interest rates, to see if it decides to cut at its next meeting on 1 August. June's MPC meeting saw a change in tone from policymakers, with suggestions that the Bank could vote for a rate cut next month. \\\"Buyers may find their mojo again when we get a rate cut from the Bank of England,\\\" said Sarah Coles, head of personal finance at Hargreaves Lansdown. \\\"This could come as early as August, although sticky services inflation and higher wages could mean we need to wait until the autumn. \\\"Either way, we\\u2019re not expecting massive overnight drops in mortgage rates, so the reaction is more likely to be a muted upturn in sentiment than an overwhelming wave of optimism.\\\"\\n\\nLast week, the Bank said that about three million households are set to see their mortgage payments rise in the next two years. These are homeowners who arranged mortgage deals before the Bank started to lift rates in 2021. These deals are now expiring, and the Bank said the majority will finish before the end of 2026. For the typical household looking for a new deal, monthly mortgage repayments are forecast to increase by about \\u00a3180, or about 28%, the Bank said. However, for around 400,000 households, monthly payments could jump by 50% or more. Bank of England figures released on Monday showed a small fall in the number of mortgages approved in May, down to 60,000 from 60,800 in April. However, the data also showed the amount borrowed through mortgages dropped sharply to \\u00a31.2bn in May, from \\u00a32.2bn the month before, although this does not include those remortgaging with the same lender.\\n\\nWays to make your mortgage more affordable\",\n",

      "            \"body\": \"Inflation in the United States is slowing again after higher readings earlier this year, Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell said Tuesday, while adding that more such evidence would be needed before the Fed would cut interest rates.\\n\\nAfter some persistently high inflation reports at the start of 2024, Powell said, the data for April and May \\u201cdo suggest we are getting back on a disinflationary path.\\u201d\\n\\nSpeaking in a panel discussion at the European Central Bank\\u2019s monetary policy conference in Sintra, Portugal, Powell said Fed officials still want to see annual price growth slow further toward their 2% target before they would feel confident of having fully defeated high inflation.\\n\\n\\u201cWe just want to understand that the levels that we\\u2019re seeing are a true reading of underlying inflation,\\u201d he added.\\n\\nPowell also acknowledged that the Fed is treading a fine line as it weighs when to cut its benchmark interest rate, which it raised 11 times from March 2022 through July 2023 to its current level of 5.3%. The rate hikes were intended to curb the worst streak of inflation in four decades by slowing borrowing and spending by consumers and businesses. Inflation did tumble from its peak in 2022 yet still remains elevated.\\n\\nIf the Fed cuts rates too soon, Powell cautioned, inflation could re-accelerate, forcing the policymakers to reverse course and impose punishing rate hikes. But if the Fed waits too long to reduce borrowing costs, it risks weakening the economy so much as to potentially cause a recession.\\n\\n\\u201cGetting the balance on monetary policy right during this critical period \\u2014 that\\u2019s really what I think about in the wee hours,\\u201d Powell said in response to a question about his top worries.\\n\\nOn Friday, the government reported that consumer prices, according to the Fed\\u2019s preferred measure, were unchanged from April to May, the mildest such reading in more than four years. And compared with a year earlier, inflation dropped to just 2.6% in May, from 2.7% in April, the government said.\\n\\nExcluding volatile food and energy costs, \\u201ccore\\u201d prices also barely rose from April to May. On a year-over-year basis, core inflation fell to 2.6% from 2.8% in April. The latest inflation figures were a sharp improvement from early this year.\\n\\nIn his appearance Tuesday, Powell said the U.S. economy and job market remain fundamentally healthy, which means the Fed can take its time in deciding when rate cuts are appropriate. Most economists think the Fed\\u2019s first rate cut will occur in September, with potentially another cut to follow by year\\u2019s end.\\n\\nThe Fed chair also said the job market is \\u201ccooling off appropriately,\\u201d which likely means that it won\\u2019t heighten inflationary pressures through rapid wage gains.\\n\\n\\u201cIt doesn\\u2019t look like it\\u2019s heating up or presenting a big problem for inflation going forward,\\u201d Powell said of the job market. \\u201cIt looks like it\\u2019s doing just what you would want it to do, which is to cool off over time.\\u201d\\n\\nPowell declined to signal any time frame for a rate cut. Investors are betting that there is nearly a 70% chance for a reduction at the Fed\\u2019s meeting in September.\\n\\nFed officials have expressed a range of views on inflation and interest-rate policy since their last meeting a little over two weeks ago.\\n\\nJohn Williams, president of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York and vice chair of the central bank\\u2019s rate-setting committee, said last week, \\u201cI am confident that we at the Fed are on a path to achieving our 2% inflation goal on a sustained basis.\\u201d\\n\\nMary Daly, president of the San Francisco Fed, cautioned last week, though, that it was \\u201chard to know if we are truly on track to sustainable price stability.\\u201d\\n\\nIn his appearance Tuesday in Portugal, Powell spoke at a panel along with Christine Lagarde, president of the European Central Bank, and Roberto Campos Neto, the head of Brazil\\u2019s central bank.\\n\\nThe ECB has already made a quarter-point cut to its key rate this year, with inflation in the 20-nation eurozone having sunk from above 10% to just 2.5%.\\n\\nIn her remarks Tuesday, though, Lagarde reiterated that the ECB is not on any \\u201cpredetermined path\\u201d and that its recent rate cut \\u201cwould be followed by further review of data.\\u201d\\n\\nSuch comments have led many analysts to conclude that the ECB\\u2019s next rate cut won\\u2019t occur until September at the earliest.\",\n",

      "            \"body\": \"By Manas Mishra, Greg Roumeliotis and Suzanne McGee\\n\\n(Reuters) -Stock influencer Keith Gill, known as \\\"Roaring Kitty,\\\" unveiled a 6.6% stake in Chewy on Monday, a surprise move that alarmed executives at the U.S. pet products company. The Chewy stake is Gill's first known investment beyond GameStop. A link connects these two investments: Ryan Cohen, the billionaire founder of Chewy, is now CEO of GameStop. Gill has in the past praised Cohen in his social media posts. Cohen founded Chewy and sold it in 2017.\\n\\nGill sent GameStop shares soaring in 2021 with a series of social media posts that drew a flood of retail money into the company. Its shares have swung wildly since Gill resurfaced online in May, following a three-year hiatus.\\n\\nGill's investment raised concerns among Chewy's top brass about asset managers who are shareholders potentially being put off by the ensuing volatility in the stock fueled by Gill's army of individual investors, said a person familiar with the company's thinking. Chewy's executives and board have not spoken to Gill, the person added.\\n\\nShares in the pet supplies retailer rose as high as $30 on Monday but reversed those gains in volatile trading. They were last down 4.8% at $25.92, with more than 54 million shares trading hands, more than three times 25-day moving average volumes.\\n\\nThe filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission showed Gill bought 9 million shares of Chewy worth about $245 million at the stock's Friday closing price of $27.24, making him Chewy's third-largest shareholder, according to LSEG data.\\n\\nIt was not clear if Gill had liquidated any of his position in GameStop, which he disclosed on June 13 was 9 million shares worth at the time around $262.1 million, to fund the Chewy stake. GameStop's shares dropped 6% on Monday, but have gained 33% so far this year.\\n\\nThe SEC, Chewy and Gill did not respond to requests for comment.\\n\\nWhile Gill has historically revealed his holdings through social media posts, he was required to file with the SEC in the case of Chewy because his investment exceeded 5% of the company's outstanding shares.\\n\\nThe SEC filing indicates Gill purchased the Chewy stake on June 24, three days before he posted a picture of a puppy on social media platform X that briefly sent Chewy shares to a near one-year high, and also sent shares in Petco and Wag up.\\n\\nSeparately, GameStop investors sued Gill on Friday, alleging he engaged in a \\\"pump-and-dump\\\" scheme that cost them money. Gill has denied past claims he had talked up the stock for his own gain, arguing he was \\\"abundantly clear\\\" that his aggressive investing style was unsuitable for most people.\\n\\nStory continues\\n\\nThe Massachusetts securities regulator is probing Gill's trading activities in GameStop, Reuters and other media previously reported.\\n\\n'NOT A CAT'\\n\\nOnce an office worker, Gill shot to fame after his cat memes and exuberant YouTube streams in which he frequently wore a bright red pirate bandana drew thousands of copycat bets on GameStop, crushing hedge funds that had bet against the stock.\\n\\nIn Monday's SEC filing, Gill remained on-brand, appearing to add a section that read: \\\"Check the appropriate box to designate whether you are a cat\\\" under which the descriptor \\\"I am not a cat\\\" was checked.\\n\\nGill has consistently argued that GameStop is undervalued and that its management team, led by Cohen, would turn the videogame retailer around. Gill's attraction to Chewy was not immediately obvious, although some analysts speculated Cohen's historic involvement in the company may have been a draw for Gill.\\n\\nCohen, who co-founded Chewy, took on GameStop in 2021 when he joined the board and was later elected its chairman, laying out a strategy to push the bricks and mortar retailer into e-commerce.\\n\\nCohen did not respond to a request for comment.\\n\\nIn his YouTube livestreams, Gill has repeatedly voiced his admiration for Cohen. \\\"This guy is the man!\\\" he exclaimed in a video dating back to January 2021, shortly after Cohen and two former Chewy colleagues joined GameStop's board. \\\"I'm excited about Ryan Cohen being at the helm.\\\"\\n\\nChewy's board is not in touch with Cohen, according to the source familiar with the company's thinking.\\n\\nShares of Chewy, which sells pet food and medicine online, have risen 15% so far in 2024 but declined in the three preceding years as spending on pets slowed after a post-pandemic boom.\\n\\nTrading volumes in Chewy stock options have been unusually high over the past 10 sessions, with some 158,000 contracts changing hands daily. That's nearly four times the average over the preceding year, according to a Reuters analysis of Trade Alert data.\\n\\nCall options, typically bought to express a bullish view, were particularly active. Contracts betting on Chewy finishing above $30 by mid-July were the most actively traded options on the stock over the last 10 days.\\n\\n(Reporting by Manas Mishra and Pratik Jain in Bengaluru, Svea Herbst-Bayliss in Boston; Saqib Ahmed and Suzanne McGee in New York; writing by Michelle Price; Editing by Devika Syamnath, Megan Davies and Trevor Hunnicutt)\",\n",
