      "            \"body\": \"Boeing said Monday that it will buy back its struggling fuselage maker Spirit AeroSystems in an all-stock deal that the planemaker has said will improve safety and quality control.\\n\\nIt said it agreed to pay $37.25 a share in Boeing stock for Spirit, giving the aerospace company an equity value of $4.7 billion. Including Spirit's debt the deal has a transaction value of $8.3 billion Boeing said.

The National Transportation Safety Board said the four bolts were removed while workers repaired damaged rivets last year at Boeing\\u2019s facility in Renton, Washington.\\n\\nThe deal to bring Spirit back in house marks a shift away from Boeing outsourcing key components for its planes.

Spirit is one of Northern Ireland\\u2019s largest manufacturing employers, with about 3,500 staff across the country.\\n\\nAbout 40% of Spirit jobs in Northern Ireland are linked to production for companies including Bombardier and Rolls-Royce, and Airbus has said it will aim to sell some of these parts.\\n\\nBoeing will pay Airbus $559m in compensation to take over operations at four of its plants, including the plant in Belfast.\\n\\nThe total transaction value is about $8.3bn when Spirit\\u2019s net debt is included, Boeing said.

      "            \"body\": \"U.S. President Joe Biden attends the first presidential debate hosted by CNN in Atlanta, Georgia, U.S., June 27, 2024. Marco Bello | Reuters\\n\\nPresident Joe Biden's raspy, unfocused, often inarticulate and widely panned debate performance stoked deep anxiety among Democrats \\u2014 and caused some commentators and fundraisers to openly call for a new nominee to run against former President Donald Trump. But replacing Biden as the party's pick less than five months out from Election Day carries enormous political risks and would be difficult, if not impossible, to pull off. Right now, the only likely way Biden could be replaced is if he willingly ends his campaign. And Biden's aides and top Democratic officials say the 81-year-old incumbent has no plans to do so. If he did drop out, Democrats have yet to identify a clear alternative candidate to swap in. But the panic among donors and party officials after watching Biden falter Thursday night in his debate against Trump has led some of them to take steps to get Biden out of the race. There are already discussions among Democratic fundraisers about trying to convince congressional leaders \\u2014 Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer in particular \\u2014 to urge Biden to announce to drop out, according to people familiar with the matter who were granted anonymity to speak freely.\\n\\nUS President Joe Biden, with Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer (L), speaks to the press after meeting with the Senate Democratic caucus to build support for his infrastructure and economic investment goals during the Democratic luncheon at the US Capitol on July 13, 2021 in Washington, DC, July 14, 2021. Saul Loeb | AFP | Getty Images\\n\\nSchumer, D-N.Y., is a top target for donors making that pitch because he privately has voiced concerns about Biden's standings in presidential election polls, those people said. Schumer was worried before the debate that Biden and Trump were statistically tied nationally, despite the Republican challenger's conviction in his New York criminal hush money trial. A spokesman for Schumer declined to comment to CNBC but pointed to a social media post the majority leader published after the debate. Schumer in that X post wrote: \\\"Tonight's debate made the choice clear: Four more years of progress, or four more years of attacks on our fundamental rights and our democracy.\\\" \\\"We've got to get out the vote for Joe Biden, Kamala Harris, and a Democratic Senate and House!\\\" the post said. That spin has not alleviated the post-debate anxiety felt by some of the president's top fundraisers. Some of those wealthy donors have lost trust in Biden's team, believing they were given false assurances about Biden's ability to take on Trump. And some of those donors who already planned to attend a high-dollar fundraiser Saturday in the Hamptons section of Long Island say they will attend the event to judge for themselves whether Biden can continue as a viable candidate. \\\"Democrats are in a very difficult situation because it's late in the campaign for a change,\\\" said Meena Bose, director of the Peter S. Kalikow Center for the Study of the American Presidency at Hofstra University, in an interview with CNBC. The only feasible way Bose could see it playing out is with Biden throwing his full support behind Vice President Kamala Harris to become the new nominee.\\n\\nU.S. Vice President Kamala Harris gives remarks on conflict-related sexual violence at an event in the Eisenhower Executive Office Building on June 17, 2024 in Washington, DC. Anna Moneymaker | Getty Images\\n\\nOtherwise, Democrats have a wide-open nomination fight just a few months before the Nov. 5 election, she said. Bose called that a \\\"disastrous\\\" prospect.\\\" \\\"Vice President Harris is a risky choice, but certainly has the visibility and is the logical choice,\\\" said Bose. \\\"It's difficult to see how you open up the Democratic presidential nomination now and have a unified path to victory in November,\\\" she added.\\n\\nHowever, even if Biden backed Harris to replace him ahead of the Democratic National Convention in August, there is no guarantee that the delegates he has won so far will shift their support to her. Biden has won nearly all of the roughly 4,000 Democratic-pledged delegates, far exceeding the threshold to make him the party nominee. If Biden refuses to drop out before August, the only opportunity to boot him as nominee would be at the Democratic National Convention that month. It is technically possible that Biden's delegates could abandon him en masse then and throw open the convention to nominate another candidate. Some Democrats who want an alternative to Biden but are concerned about Harris' relatively low opinion polls and rocky campaign history have looked to California Gov. Gavin Newsom, Ohio Sen. Sherrod Brown, Illinois Gov. J.B. Pritzker and others as possible contenders.\\n\\nCalifornia Governor Gavin Newsom (D) reacts as he speaks to the members of the press on the day of the first presidential debate hosted by CNN in Atlanta, Georgia, U.S., June 27, 2024. REUTERS/Marco Bello Marco Bello | Reuters\\n\\nBut blocking Biden from the nomination is highly improbable, as delegates tend to be strong supporters of their chosen candidate. \\\"That is probably the worst-case scenario,\\\" Bose said. \\\"If the Democrats are going to have a change at the top of the ticket, President Biden has to endorse it and, frankly, probably initiate it.\\\" The DNC rules allow for the party to select another presidential nominee, but only in the \\\"event of death, resignation or disability\\\" that leaves the role vacant.\\n\\nwatch now\",\n",

      "            \"body\": \"President Joe Biden\\u2019s family used a Sunday gathering at Camp David to urge him to stay in the race and keep fighting despite his dreadful debate performance, and some members criticized how his staff prepared him for the faceoff, according to four people familiar with the discussions.\\n\\nBiden spent the day sequestered with first lady Jill Biden, his children and grandchildren. It was a previously scheduled trip to the presidential retreat in Maryland for a photo shoot with Annie Leibovitz for the upcoming Democratic National Convention.\\n\\nBut the gathering was also an exercise in trying to figure out how to quell Democratic anxiety that has exploded following Thursday\\u2019s performance.\\n\\nWhile his family was aware of how poorly he performed against Donald Trump, they also continue to think he\\u2019s the best person to beat the Republican presumptive nominee. They also believe he is capable of doing the job of president for another four years, according to the people who were not authorized to speak publicly about internal discussions and spoke to The Associated Press on condition of anonymity.\\n\\nAmong the most vocal: Jill Biden and son Hunter, whom the president has long gone to for counsel and advice. Both believe the president shouldn\\u2019t bow out when he\\u2019s down, and believe that he can come back from what they see as one subpar performance. The family questioned how he was prepared for the debate by staff and wondered if they could have done something better, the people said.\\n\\nBiden\\u2019s campaign has spent the days since the debate \\u2014 where he appeared raspy, trailed off, and at times gave convoluted answers \\u2014 working to keep donors and surrogates on board as Democrats increasingly questioned whether he should stay in the race.\\n\\nAt this point in the delegate process, Biden would likely have to decide to drop out for there to be a new nominee. And the people he listens to most in the world \\u2014 his wife and son \\u2014 are telling him to stay in.\\n\\nEven before the debate, the age of the 81-year-old Democratic president had been a liability with voters, and the prime-time faceoff appeared to reinforce the public\\u2019s deep-seated concerns before perhaps the largest audience he will have in the four months until Election Day. CNN said more than 51 million people watched the debate.\\n\\nWhile the president was huddled with his family, prominent Democrats rallied to deliver a public show of support for his campaign on Sunday.\\n\\n\\u201cI do not believe that Joe Biden has a problem leading for the next four years,\\u201d said one close ally, Democratic Rep. James Clyburn of South Carolina. \\u201cJoe Biden should continue to run on his record.\\u201d\\n\\nSen. Raphael Warnock, a Georgia Democrat and Baptist minister, said there had been \\u201cmore than a few Sundays when I wish I had preached a better sermon,\\u201d relating the experience to Biden\\u2019s debate performance.\\n\\n\\u201cBut after the sermon was over, it was my job to embody the message, to show up for the people that I serve. And that\\u2019s what Joe Biden has been doing his entire life,\\u201d Warnock said. It was an echo of the message from other supporters that Biden had a bad debate, but a lifetime of good governance.\\n\\nWarnock, like Clyburn and others, pivoted to Trump\\u2019s many falsehoods during the debate \\u2014 lapses that Biden and the debate moderators often failed to fact check from the stage \\u2014 including about the Jan. 6, 2021, attack on the Capitol by Trump supporters, immigration and the outcome of the 2020 election.\\n\\n\\u201cWhenever his mouth was moving, he was lying,\\u201d Warnock said of Trump.\\n\\nBut concern simmered among some Democrats that Biden\\u2019s campaign and the Democratic National Committee were not taking seriously enough the impact of the debate.\\n\\nFormer Iowa Sen. Tom Harkin, who served for more than two decades with Biden in the Senate, called the debate \\u201ca disaster from which Biden cannot recover.\\u201d\\n\\nHarkin suggested that Democratic senators in pivotal races and \\u201cmaybe all incumbent Democratic Senators should pen a letter to Biden asking him to release his delegates and step aside so the convention can choose a new candidate,\\u201d according to an email to supporters that was obtained by The Associated Press. It was first referenced in Iowa journalist Julie Gammack\\u2019s column on Saturday, Iowa Potluck.\\n\\n\\u201cThis is a perilous time, and is more important than the ego or desires of Joe Biden to stay as President,\\u201d Harkin concluded.\\n\\nRep. Jamie Raskin, D-Md., described \\u201cvery honest, serious and rigorous conversations taking place at every level of our party \\u2026 about what to do.\\u201d\\n\\nBut DNC Chairman Jaime Harrison and Biden\\u2019s campaign manager, Julie Chavez Rodriguez, held a Saturday afternoon call with dozens of committee members across the country \\u2014 a group of some of the most influential members of the party \\u2014 where they offered a rosy assessment of the path forward and gave no opportunity for others on the call to respond with questions.\\n\\nMultiple committee members on the call, most granted anonymity to talk about the private discussion, described feeling like they were being asked to ignore a serious predicament.\\n\\n\\u201cThere were a number of things that could have been said in addressing the situation. But we didn\\u2019t get that. We were being gaslit,\\u201d said Joe Salazar, an elected DNC member from Colorado, who was on the call.\",\n",

      "            \"body\": \"In this article RIVN Follow your favorite stocks CREATE FREE ACCOUNT\\n\\n2025 Rivian R1S Rivian\\n\\nA Thursday investor event for Rivian Automotive that focused on cost-cutting efforts, efficiency gains and in-house technologies and software wasn't enough to build on the company's significant share growth this week. Shares of the all-electric vehicle startup fell by about 2% to 6% for much of the event, eating into some of its 23% gain in shares the day before on news of an up to $5 billion investment by Volkswagen Group . Rivian's stock closed Thursday down 1.8% to $14.47 per share, off by roughly 39% year to date amid investor concerns regarding cash burn and a slowdown in EV sales. Rivian on Thursday reconfirmed its 2024 guidance that included production of 57,000 vehicles and a path to positive gross profit during the fourth quarter, including regulatory credits. It also outlined longer-term growths, such as plans to achieve positive adjusted earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization in 2027. \\\"Everything that you're hearing from us, around our product, around how we're running the business, around how we're driving toward profitability, my hope is that you're seeing really an extreme sense of urgency,\\\" Rivian CEO RJ Scaringe said during the event. \\\"We're very, very fast driving towards the improvements necessary to get to positive free cash flow and, before that, positive margins this year.\\\"\\n\\nStock Chart Icon Stock chart icon Rivian's stock performance\\n\\nRivian also outlined long-term financial targets of a roughly 25% gross margin, 10% free cash flow and adjusted profit margin in the \\\"high teens.\\\" The company did not release a time frame for these targets. Scaringe spent much of his time during the roughly four-hour presentation discussing efficiencies in products and manufacturing, which he said are expected to lead to 20% material cost reductions in its current vehicles, followed by 45% targeted reductions in its upcoming \\\"R2\\\" vehicles, which are projected to begin production in early 2026. The reductions range from physical savings, such as a 54% decrease in design costs of its R2 vehicles compared with current models, to lower costs on more complex systems such as battery packs and electrical hardware. For example, the company is using 10 fewer in-house electronic control units, or ECUs, in its recently redesigned R1 vehicles, allowing it to remove 1.6 miles in wiring harness length and 44 pounds out of the vehicle. Rivian's software expertise is at the center of VW's plans to invest $5 billion in the automaker by 2026, including an anticipated joint venture between the companies to create electrical architecture and software technology. Volkswagen is expected to use Rivian's electrical architecture and software stack for vehicles beginning in the second half of the decade, Scaringe said during the investment announcement. He said the joint venture does not include anything with battery technologies, vehicle propulsion platforms, high voltage systems or autonomy and electrical hardware.\\n\\nA provided image of Oliver Blume, CEO of Volkswagen Group and RJ Scaringe, founder and CEO of Rivian, as the companies announce joint venture plans on June 25, 2024.

However, the report shows the feeling is highest among cultures that take the most days off. Some 84% of Germans and 69% of French respondents said they feel they don't have enough time off, according to Expedia's \\\"Vacation Deprivation Report\\\" published on June 20. That's despite respondents from both countries taking the most vacation days \\u2014 27 days and 29 days, respectively \\u2014 in the survey. The survey of more than 11,500 workers showed Americans take the least time off per year (11 days), followed by Japan (12 days). However, only 53% of Japanese said they feel \\\"vacation deprived\\\" compared to 65% of Americans, it showed.\\n\\nThe survey \\u2014 Expedia's 24th annual report on the topic \\u2014 shows that while vacation deprivation rates have decreased in many parts of the world, the feeling is at an 11-year high in the United States.\\n\\nWhat's happening in France and Germany?\\n\\nExpedia's report indicates that feeling \\\"vacation deprived\\\" has less to do with the actual time off one takes, and more to do with cultural mores around work and free time. \\\"The French overwhelmingly view time off as a basic, fundamental right, while Americans seem to treat is as a guilty pleasure,\\\" said Christie Hudson, head of public relations for Expedia in the United States. \\\"This is why not even a month seems like enough time to the average French worker.\\\"\\n\\nwatch now\\n\\nAmong Germans, however, only 42% said they feel their employers are supportive of them taking their vacation time, the lowest rate across all markets, said Hudson. \\\"This can contribute to guilt and being unable to unplug and feel refreshed after vacation,\\\" she said, adding that \\\"vacation deprivation\\\" can result from feeling unable to use the days off you are given, she said.\\n\\nWasted vacation days\\n\\nDespite most workers indicating they feel vacation deprived, respondents from nearly every location admitted to letting some of their annual leave lapse.\\n\\nHong Kongers, however, meticulously planned their leave, not allowing a single day to go unused, on average, the report showed. Interestingly, Hong Kong was the only location where workers said they planned to take more time off than they're given, said Hudson. \\\"In 2024, 15% of Hong Kongers plan on taking 31 vacation days, exceeding the average allotted 25.5 days,\\\" said Hudson. \\\"It's an interesting finding and could be linked to the fact that they seem to have a strong pro-PTO culture: 80% of Hong Kong workers agree that their employers are supportive of employees taking their vacation time, which is one of the highest rates globally.\\\" That could mean that \\\"those few extra days here and there are overlooked,\\\" she said. Singaporeans, too, carefully plan their time off, allowing only one of their 20 days of annual leave to lapse, according to the report. But those in Japan aren't nearly as focused on maximizing their days off, it showed. Respondents there left seven out of 19 days on the table, on average.\\n\\nOne big break vs. many mini-breaks\",\n",

However, the report shows the feeling is highest among cultures that take the most days off. Some 84% of Germans and 69% of French respondents said they feel they don't have enough time off, according to Expedia's \\\"Vacation Deprivation Report\\\" published on June 20. That's despite respondents from both countries taking the most vacation days \\u2014 27 days and 29 days, respectively \\u2014 in the survey. The survey of more than 11,500 workers showed Americans take the least time off per year (11 days), followed by Japan (12 days). However, only 53% of Japanese said they feel \\\"vacation deprived\\\" compared to 65% of Americans, it showed.\\n\\nThe survey \\u2014 Expedia's 24th annual report on the topic \\u2014 shows that while vacation deprivation rates have decreased in many parts of the world, the feeling is at an 11-year high in the United States.\\n\\nWhat's happening in France and Germany?\\n\\nExpedia's report indicates that feeling \\\"vacation deprived\\\" has less to do with the actual time off one takes, and more to do with cultural mores around work and free time. \\\"The French overwhelmingly view time off as a basic, fundamental right, while Americans seem to treat is as a guilty pleasure,\\\" said Christie Hudson, head of public relations for Expedia in the United States. \\\"This is why not even a month seems like enough time to the average French worker.\\\"\\n\\nwatch now\\n\\nAmong Germans, however, only 42% said they feel their employers are supportive of them taking their vacation time, the lowest rate across all markets, said Hudson. \\\"This can contribute to guilt and being unable to unplug and feel refreshed after vacation,\\\" she said, adding that \\\"vacation deprivation\\\" can result from feeling unable to use the days off you are given, she said.\\n\\nWasted vacation days\\n\\nDespite most workers indicating they feel vacation deprived, respondents from nearly every location admitted to letting some of their annual leave lapse.\\n\\nHong Kongers, however, meticulously planned their leave, not allowing a single day to go unused, on average, the report showed. Interestingly, Hong Kong was the only location where workers said they planned to take more time off than they're given, said Hudson. \\\"In 2024, 15% of Hong Kongers plan on taking 31 vacation days, exceeding the average allotted 25.5 days,\\\" said Hudson. \\\"It's an interesting finding and could be linked to the fact that they seem to have a strong pro-PTO culture: 80% of Hong Kong workers agree that their employers are supportive of employees taking their vacation time, which is one of the highest rates globally.\\\" That could mean that \\\"those few extra days here and there are overlooked,\\\" she said. Singaporeans, too, carefully plan their time off, allowing only one of their 20 days of annual leave to lapse, according to the report. But those in Japan aren't nearly as focused on maximizing their days off, it showed. Respondents there left seven out of 19 days on the table, on average.\\n\\nOne big break vs. many mini-breaks\",\n",

As far as they are concerned, they\\u2019re not getting nearly enough vacation days\\u2014even as they\\u2019re getting the most among some of their peers, a new Expedia report shows.\\n\\nGermans and French have among the most generous annual leave periods, with 31 and 33 days, respectively. That\\u2019s over a month in both cases\\u2014two-and-a-half times the number of days the U.S. employees get. Yet, a survey of over 11,500 employees worldwide revealed that workers in Germany and France report not having enough vacation time.\\n\\nIn contrast, their American and Japanese peers take significantly fewer days off work and seem largely satisfied with it. While 65% of U.S. and 53% of Japanese employees feel deprived of a vacation, that figure climbs to 84% among Germans and 69% for the French.\\n\\nMore time off certainly doesn\\u2019t address the larger question of work-life balance, as some European employees are left wanting more. But what explains this divergence?\\n\\nIt turns out that people\\u2019s attitudes toward vacation and its place in each country\\u2019s culture dictate why they feel deprived of their downtime.\\n\\nIf you consider the U.S., employees work longer hours, according to OECD data. In 2022, the average worker spent 1,811 hours working through the year compared to 1,341 hours and 1,511 hours in Germany and France, respectively.\\n\\nCall it what you will, whether that\\u2019s ambition\\u2014or its lack thereof, as the Norwegian sovereign wealth fund CEO Nicolai Tangen said in April, it\\u2019s what distinguishes the workers\\u2019 attitudes.\\n\\n\\u201cParticularly in America, there\\u2019s an \\u2018ideal worker\\u2019 norm, and we feel pressure to look committed to the job at all times,\\u201d Dr. Mindy Shoss, a professor of psychology at the University of Central Florida, said to Expedia. The reason Americans cited for not taking enough time off was \\u201clife is too busy to plan or go on vacation,\\u201d the travel company\\u2019s 24th iteration of the \\u201cVacation Deprivation\\u201d report found.\\n\\nOn the contrary, vacations are seen as a \\u201cbasic right\\u201d in France, Christie Hudson, Expedia\\u2019s head of public relations, told Fortune last month. They\\u2019re also seen as a crucial aspect of overall well-being, which isn\\u2019t valid to the same extent in the U.S.\\n\\n\\u201cThe distinctly French emphasis on the fundamental right to rest is one to adopt everywhere,\\u201d the Expedia report said.\\n\\nWhat gives?\\n\\nFrance has become known as one of the least workaholic nations, with many people taking time off and working fewer hours.\\n\\nHowever, more generally, studies have found that European culture accommodates work-life balance more than the U.S. Countries like the U.K. have a statutory requirement entitling workers to 28 days off.\\n\\nThe approach is straightforward for Europeans: As long as people meet the subsistence level, they choose free time over wealth creation, unlike their American counterparts who prioritize the opposite, the Financial Times reported.\\n\\nEven when Americans choose to take vacations, rest and relaxation are often not a priority, making it harder to unplug. This explains the desire for more time off.\\n\\nIf we widen our gaze further, countries like Hong Kong and Japan offer unique lessons on how best to utilize the time workers get\\u2014whether that\\u2019s a little or a lot.\\n\\nHong Kong-based workers systematically plan their time off, often around public holidays, to maximize their vacations. That\\u2019s how they have no leftover days on average, and the same is true of Singapore.\\n\\nIn Japan, where workers get roughly 19 days off a year, seven days go unused, according to Expedia. Still, Japanese employees feel the least deprived of vacations. The trick? Taking short, but frequent breaks between work to make the most of time off.\\n\\n\\u201cIn Japan, people take time off every month instead of just twice a year. For the French, not even a full month of vacation feels like enough time,\\u201d Melanie Fish, Expedia brands public relations head said.\\n\\n\\u201cClearly there\\u2019s a lot for the U.S. to borrow from, whether it\\u2019s spreading your PTO throughout the year or prioritizing rest on your next vacation.\\u201d\",\n",

      "            \"body\": \"Ask a millennial in the UK in 2024 what distinguishes them from their parents\\u2019 generation and it is likely that a single-word answer will crop up: housing.\\n\\nSince 2010, despite a succession of government pledges to would-be homeowners, the average age of a first-time buyer in the UK has risen. Meanwhile rents have soared, homelessness has more than doubled and housebuilding targets have been repeatedly missed.\\n\\nHere, as part of our wider series on how 14 years of Conservative party rule has changed Britain, we look at some of the key datasets around housing.\\n\\nThis article necessarily focuses on England because many housing matters are devolved to the Welsh, Scottish and Northern Irish governments.\\n\\nOwning a home has become harder Owning a home \\u201chas got harder\\u201d under the Conservatives. That\\u2019s not a quote from a Labour party attack advert \\u2013 but Rishi Sunak in a recent election interview with the BBC (he went on to say he would like to make it easier again). House price chart When David Cameron entered Downing Street two years after the 2008 house-price crash, the median house price in England stood at 6.9 times full-time employees\\u2019 median annual earnings: in 2023, it was 8.3 times. London in particular has become much more unaffordable since 2010: the median property price was 12.7 times the median Londoner\\u2019s earnings last September. It would be unfair to lay all of the blame for unaffordable housing at the door of the Tories \\u2013 it has been two decades since a mid-range-price house in England was less than five times median household income (a different metric from the full-time-earnings ratio mentioned above) and prices rose much faster than income under New Labour. But \\u2013 outside the 2008 housing bubble \\u2013 the middle-earning household could still afford to buy a house in the cheapest 20% of the market. That changed in 2021 when official data confirmed that the middle classes were being squeezed yet further, with only the cheapest 10% of houses now affordable to the middle-earning household.\\n\\nRenting a home is more expensive Both prime ministerial candidates have said they want a younger generation to experience the feeling of getting the keys to their first flat. But house prices aren\\u2019t the only blocker on home ownership because rents are increasingly eating into would-be-first-buyers\\u2019 ability to save for a deposit. Rental price chart The Office for National Statistics\\u2019 private rents index shows that renting in England is now 50% more expensive than 14 years ago, with the average rental price in London reaching a record level of \\u00a32,035 a month in February 2024. The cost of renting has increased across all the regions, but there are differences. While the rise in London and the south-west has gone above 50%, average prices in the north-east have gone up by 28%. This data covers all rents and not newly advertised properties, which means that for those newly renting or moving from one rented dwelling into another costs have probably risen by even more.\\n\\nNot enough houses are being built Part of the reason for rising unaffordability \\u2013 for buyers and renters \\u2013 is a lack of supply. Housing target chart Successive governments have missed their building targets: David Cameron did not keep his promise of providing 200,000 new \\u201cstarter homes\\u201d \\u2013 aimed at first-time buyers under the age of 40 \\u2013 in 2015. The National Audit Office said that, by the end of 2019, no such homes have been built. Theresa May made housing one of her main domestic priorities, most significantly in her 2018 party conference speech, when she announced measures designed to allow councils to borrow more to build up to an estimated 10,000 more homes a year; a welcomed, if modest target which, again, wasn\\u2019t met. Boris Johnson\\u2019s 2019 manifesto promised 300,000 new houses a year in England by the mid-2020s, although less than two years later, the then housing secretary Robert Jenrick admitted they would miss it by \\u201ca country mile\\u201d (the lastest figures show it\\u2019s 22% below target). And where local authorities once provided a sizeable amount of newbuilds \\u2013 which made up close to 40% of new builds in the 1970s, the private sector is now dominant. It has built more than 80% of new housing stock since 2019 with just 1% coming from local authorities (the balance comes from housing associations).\\n\\n\\u201cAffordable\\u201d rent has replaced social rent One of the early acts of the coalition government was the introduction of affordable rent \\u2013 a new type of way to rent a property from a housing association with a monthly cost higher than social rent but lower than the market rate. It was introduced in 2011 as part of the government\\u2019s austerity measures to help housing associations raise money after a huge cut to their funding. It has turned out to be affordable in name only in many parts of England and has all but killed off building for social rent. Affordable homes Social rents are calculated taking into account local earnings and property values, while affordable rents can be up to 80% of the going rate in the private rented sector, and are typically set at that level. In 2022/23 the median weekly social rent hit \\u00a389, the equivalent figure for affordable rents was \\u00a3134. That\\u2019s across England as a whole: in some parts of the country, affordable rents are double social rents, according to analysis by Inside Housing magazine.

In December 2019 rent cost \\u00a31,064 a month on average according to the Office for National Statistics (ONS). By May 2024 this had risen by 22% to \\u00a31,301 for new and existing tenancies. Renters have told the BBC they have settled for mouldy properties, sofa-surfed or moved back in with relatives. The National Residential Landlords Association blamed a \\u201cchronic shortage\\u201d of private rental homes on high interest rates prompting landlords to leave the market. Hundreds of people have been in touch with the BBC about rent via Your Voice, Your Vote.\\n\\n'All of us have been homeless'\\n\\nDelia-Ioana, a 24-year-old freelance production assistant, pays \\u00a3567 per month for a flat share in Bristol. She said it took eight months for a dripping tap to be fixed, impacting her water bills, and the walls were mouldy and damp with mineral deposits. Delia-Ioana plans to move out soon, but said rent was often too expensive, and she worried about the future. \\u201cI was looking at my friends \\u2013 all of us have been homeless at some point. A floor here, a sofa there,\\u201d she said. \\u201cHow are we going to afford to have children if we can\\u2019t afford a house?\\u201d Average rents in Bristol rose 34% between December 2019 and May 2024, from \\u00a31,312 to \\u00a31,759 per month, the eighth largest increase among local authorities in England.\\n\\nDelia Ioana/BBC Delia-Ioana said every room in her flat share has mould in\\n\\nHow has rent changed in your area?\\n\\nWhy has rent been increasing?\\n\\nBetween December 2019 and May 2024, average private rent in England rose by 22% according to the Office for National Statistics (ONS). It used a \\\"geometric average\\\" to account for differences in property types and changes in the rental markets. Across a similar period (April 2019 to April 2024) the Institute for Fiscal Studies estimated UK earnings rose by 4-6% in real terms. The Bank of England started raising interest rates in December 2021, pushing mortgages up. It has kept them at 5.25% since last summer, aiming to slow the pace of rising prices. Richard Donnell, property company Zoopla\\u2019s executive head of research, said these increases have made it harder for potential first-time buyers. According to Mr Donnell there are fewer private landlords, meaning the total number of rental homes in the UK has barely changed since 2016 - but demand has continued to soar. \\u201cThe big increase in demand happened after the pandemic ended and the economy reopened,\\\" he said. \\\"You had this big return of people to cities, the international borders reopened.\\u201d He said the growth of working from home has made cheaper areas outside big cities more appealing.\\n\\nWhere has rent increased the most?\\n\\nLondon has the highest average rent in England. But Tameside in Greater Manchester saw the largest percentage increase, up by more than 40% - from \\u00a3555 in December 2019, to \\u00a3780 in May 2024. Six Greater Manchester local authorities were among the areas with the biggest percentage rises in England.\\n\\n'It was like a bidding war'\\n\\nLuisa, a civil servant renting in Tameside, lived with her two adult children in a three-bedroom house for \\u00a3695 per month in 2022. On 25 September that year, her landlord sent her a letter saying he was selling the property. He cited government decisions, interest rate increases, rising insurances and legislation he said unfairly tackled landlords. Two days earlier, then Prime Minister Liz Truss\\u2019s chancellor Kwasi Kwarteng shared a \\u2018mini budget\\u2019 intended to stimulate economic growth. This included \\u00a345bn of unfunded tax cuts - now mostly reversed. Following this, inflation and interest rates increased. A Liberal Democrat spokesperson blamed \\\"Liz Truss' botched budget\\\" for \\\"driving up rents for tenants\\\" and a Labour spokesperson said \\\"time and time again, the Tories have failed to stand up for renters\\\". A Conservative Party spokesman said \\u201cCovid and the war in Ukraine hiked up inflation and put pressure on renters, but we have got inflation down to normal levels\\u201d, adding they were committed to creating a fairer market for renters. Luisa spent four months looking for somewhere to live. \\u201cPeople were offering over the asking price or six months\\u2019 rent up front. I wasn\\u2019t in a position to do that,\\u201d she said. \\u201cIt was like a bidding war \\u2013 I\\u2019d turn up and there was a block viewing with about eight to 10 different people there.\\u201d Luisa rented the sixth house she viewed for \\u00a3900 per month. She said: \\u201cI feel sorry for my children because my daughter\\u2019s 20 and at uni, my son is 26 \\u2013 he has to help me out with rent. He\\u2019s unable to save up for his future.\\u201d\\n\\nHow does your area compare to the rest of England?\\n\\nWhat do the different parties promise on rent?\\n\\nConservatives: Build 1.6 million homes over five years, introduce a new Help to Buy scheme requiring a 5% deposit and scrap stamp duty for properties up to \\u00a3425,000 Labour: Help build 1.5 million homes over five years, introduce a permanent mortgage guarantee scheme to help first-time buyers, and end rental bidding wars. Extend protections around damp, mould and cold. Liberal Democrats: Build 380,000 homes a year and make three-year tenancies the default Reform UK: Prioritise local people and those who have paid into the system for social housing, and encourage more people to become landlords by scrapping some taxes Green Party: Create 150,000 new social homes a year, implement rent controls and bring empty homes back into use\",\n",

      "            \"body\": \"Justices reject plan to shield Sacklers in Purdue opioid deal\\n\\n4 days ago By Natalie Sherman , BBC News Share\\n\\nEPA Campaigners and family members of those who have died of opioids outside the US Supreme Court\\n\\nThe US Supreme Court has struck down a part of the bankruptcy deal for Purdue Pharma that would have shielded members of the Sackler family from future lawsuits over their role in fuelling the opioid crisis. The Sacklers, who owned and operated the Oxycontin-maker for decades, had agreed to pay $6bn (\\u00a34.7bn) towards a wider settlement in exchange for sweeping protections against civil claims related to the addictive opioid. But the nation's top court ruled that granting such protections to the Sacklers, who did not themselves declare bankruptcy was not authorised under law. Sackler family members said they would continue to push for a settlement, warning that the alternative was \\\"costly and chaotic legal proceedings in courtrooms across the country\\\". The ruling is a victory for the US government and others who had challenged the deal, arguing that releasing the Sacklers was a misuse of the system. But it raises major questions about the future of the agreement, which had won significant, if mixed, support from many who sued the company and saw it as the only practical way to reach the family's billions for drug treatment and other uses. Ellen Isaacs, whose son Patrick Ryan Wroblewski died of an overdose in 2018 at the age of 33, was one of the family members who had opposed the shield for the Sacklers. She said she was not sure what came next, but was hopeful that justice would be done. \\\"I'd like to see them held fully accountable,\\\" she said. \\\"I'm just so grateful to the Supreme Court right now I can't get beyond that.\\\"\\n\\nReuters Oxycontin, often an entryway into harder drugs, such as heroin, has been blamed for driving the opioid crisis\\n\\nPurdue became a household name in the US as the maker and promoter of OxyContin - a prescription painkiller it promoted as safe, despite being aware it was both highly addictive and widely abused. The company declared bankruptcy in 2019, after it was hit by thousands of lawsuits brought by states, cities and families. It later pleaded guilty to criminal charges, including defrauding health agencies and making illegal payments to doctors. The kind of shield granted to the Sacklers in this deal has been a critical feature of other high-profile settlements, including those involving Boy Scouts of America and the Catholic Church. But courts have been divided as to whether such \\\"releases\\\" from liability for third parties like the Sacklers are actually permitted. In asking the Supreme Court to take up the issue, lawyers for the US government said letting it stand \\\"would leave in place a roadmap for wealthy corporations and individuals to misuse the bankruptcy system\\\" and escape accountability. Writing for the 5-4 majority, Justice Neil Gorsuch echoed those concerns. \\\"The Sacklers have not agreed to place anything approaching their full assets on the table for opioid victims, \\\" he wrote. \\\"Yet they seek a judicial order that would extinguish virtually all claims against them for fraud, willful injury, and even wrongful death, all without the consent of those who have brought and seek to bring such claims.\\\" The court noted that the Sacklers, who have long denied wrongdoing, \\\"seek to pay less than the code ordinarily requires and receive more than it normally permits\\\".\\n\\nOxycontin, often an entryway into harder drugs, such as heroin, has been blamed for driving the opioid crisis. Since 1999, a few years after the drug became available, deaths from opioid overdoses have surged eightfold to more than 80,000 annually. Court filings allege the Sackler family was long aware of the legal risks, and withdrew some $11bn from the company in the decade before its bankruptcy. They stashed much of the money overseas, while using some of it to pay company taxes, making recovery difficult. When the Supreme Court heard arguments last year, dozens of protesters opposing the deal showed up, holding signs such as \\\"my dead son does not release the Sacklers\\\". But many others had backed the deal, willing to accept the terms if the result was billions of dollars for treatment, as well as $750m that would go directly to opioid victims, estimated at $3,500-$48,000 each.\\n\\nGetty Images\",\n",

      "            \"body\": \"High mortgage rates pricing out buyers, says Nationwide\\n\\n4 hours ago By Nick Edser , Business reporter, BBC News Share\\n\\nGetty Images\\n\\nHigh mortgage rates mean affordability is still \\\"stretched\\\" for many home buyers, according to the Nationwide. The building society said that while earnings had been rising faster than house prices in recent years, this had not been enough to offset the impact of more expensive mortgages. Its comments came as it said house price growth had been \\\"broadly stable\\\" in June, with prices up 0.2% from the previous month. The average house price is now \\u00a3266,064, the lender said.\\n\\nPrices were up 1.5% from a year earlier, but Nationwide said activity in the housing market had been \\\"broadly flat\\\" over the past 12 months, with transactions down by about 15% compared with 2019. The lender said the market was still being affected by the increase in mortgage rates, which started climbing after the Bank of England began to raise its key interest rate in late 2021. Robert Gardner, Nationwide's chief economist, said that mortgage rates are \\\"still well above the record lows prevailing in 2021 in the wake of the pandemic\\\". \\\"For example, the interest rate on a five-year fixed rate mortgage for a borrower with a 25% deposit was 1.3% in late 2021, but in recent months this has been nearer to 4.7%. \\\"As a result, housing affordability is still stretched.\\\" Nationwide's figures are based on the building society's own mortgage lending, which does not include buyers who purchase homes with cash, or buy-to-let deals. Cash buyers account for about a third of housing sales. The impact of higher borrowing costs can be seen in the fact that transactions involving a mortgage are down by nearly 25% over the past year, Nationwide said. Meanwhile the number of cash transactions for properties is about 5% higher than pre-pandemic levels. Across the UK, Northern Ireland saw the biggest price increases, up 4.1% from a year earlier. Wales and Scotland both saw a 1.4% annual rise. Prices in England climbed by 0.6%, with northern regions seeing bigger increases in general than the south.\\n\\nDespite some major lenders cutting their mortgage rates last week, home loan costs remain far higher than pre-pandemic levels. According to financial information service Moneyfacts, the average rate on a two-year fixed mortgage deal stands at 5.95%, while for a five-year deal the average is 5.53%. The focus is now on the Bank of England's Monetary Policy Committee (MPC), which sets interest rates, to see if it decides to cut at its next meeting on 1 August. June's MPC meeting saw a change in tone from policymakers, with suggestions that the Bank could vote for a rate cut next month. \\\"Buyers may find their mojo again when we get a rate cut from the Bank of England,\\\" said Sarah Coles, head of personal finance at Hargreaves Lansdown. \\\"This could come as early as August, although sticky services inflation and higher wages could mean we need to wait until the autumn. \\\"Either way, we\\u2019re not expecting massive overnight drops in mortgage rates, so the reaction is more likely to be a muted upturn in sentiment than an overwhelming wave of optimism.\\\" Last week, the Bank said that about three million households are set to see their mortgage payments rise in the next two years. These are homeowners who arranged mortgage deals before the Bank started to lift rates in 2021. These deals are now expiring, and the Bank said the majority will finish before the end of 2026. For the typical household looking for a new deal, monthly mortgage repayments are forecast to increase by about \\u00a3180, or about 28%, the Bank said. However, for around 400,000 households, monthly payments could jump by 50% or more. Bank of England figures released on Monday showed a small fall in the number of mortgages approved in May, down to 60,000 from 60,800 in April. However, the data also showed the amount borrowed through mortgages dropped sharply to \\u00a31.2bn in May, from \\u00a32.2bn the month before, although this does not include those remortgaging with the same lender.\\n\\nWays to make your mortgage more affordable\",\n",

      "            \"body\": \"Energy prices fall but relief may be temporary\\n\\n12 hours ago By Kevin Peachey , Cost of living correspondent Share\\n\\nGetty Images\\n\\nA drop in domestic gas and electricity prices has now taken effect, but costs are expected to rise again in October. Regulator Ofgem's new price cap for England, Wales and Scotland came into force on Monday, meaning a typical household's energy bill will fall by \\u00a3122 a year. That brings down the bill for a household using a typical amount of gas and electricity to \\u00a31,568 a year, the lowest for two years. But forecasters expect it to rise again in the run-up to winter, more than reversing the latest drop.\\n\\nLeading consultancy Cornwall Insight predicts that a typical household's annual bill will be back up to \\u00a31,723 in October, a \\u00a3155, or 10%, increase from now. \\\"Modest falls in summer look set to be wiped out by bigger rises in autumn when people will need to put the heating back on,\\\" said Adam Scorer, chief executive of charity National Energy Action. \\\"The cost of energy remains an unaffordable luxury that many of the poorest simply cannot afford.\\\" Although the price cap is changed every three months, it is illustrated by Ofgem in terms of an annual bill for a household using a typical amount of gas and electricity. People in larger properties will tend to pay more overall owing to higher energy usage, and those in smaller properties will pay less.\\n\\nThat is because the cap, set by Ofgem, limits the maximum price that can be charged for each unit of gas and electricity - not the total bill. It affects the gas and electricity bills of 28 million households, but does not impact customers in Northern Ireland, where the sector is regulated differently but where prices are also falling.\\n\\nEnergy bills are considerably lower than the peak after Russia's invasion of Ukraine, when the government stepped in to limit bill rises. That has fed through to falls in the general rate of rising prices, known as inflation. However, a typical household's energy bill remains about \\u00a3400 higher than three years ago, prompting debate over the issue during the election campaign.\\n\\nIn addition, households have built up a collective debt to suppliers of about \\u00a33bn owing, primarily, to the pressure from high prices. Those on prepayment meters, who tend to top up meters during the colder, darker months and are often under more financial pressure, will see a less immediate impact of a drop in prices in the summer. The vast majority of households pay by direct debit, and their payments are smoothed out over the year. They should have been contacted by their supplier about the latest price changes. Experts say it is a good idea to take a meter reading now, to ensure billpayers are charged at the correct rate. Ofgem is reviewing the way the price cap is calculated, including sifting through a host of responses to a consultation on standing charges.\\n\\nLatest changes in detail\\n\\nThe new prices that took effect for July to the end of September mean: Gas prices are now capped at 5.48p per kilowatt hour (kWh), and electricity at 22.36p per kWh\\n\\nA typical household uses 2,700 kWh of electricity a year, and 11,500 kWh of gas\\n\\nHouseholds on pre-payment meters pay slightly less than those on direct debit, with a typical bill of \\u00a31,522\\n\\nThose who pay their bills every three months by cash or cheque pay more, with a typical bill of \\u00a31,668\\n\\nStanding charges - a fixed daily charge covering the costs of connecting to a supply - are unchanged at 60p a day for electricity and 31p a day for gas, although they vary by region\\n\\nHow to keep energy use - and bills - down\",\n",

      "            \"body\": \"Boeing to get 'sweetheart deal' - victims' lawyer\\n\\n7 hours ago By Jo\\u00e3o da Silva , Business reporter Share\\n\\nGetty Images A lawyer representing families of victims of two fatal Boeing 737 Max crashes says they \\\"strenuously object to this plea deal\\\"\\n\\nA lawyer representing victims of two fatal Boeing 737 Max crashes has told the BBC that the US government is preparing to offer the plane maker a \\\"sweetheart plea deal\\\". Paul Cassell, who says he got the information \\\"directly from the Justice Department\\\", added that the deal includes a small fine, three years of probation and independent safety audits. Boeing did not immediately reply to the BBC's request for comment, while the Justice Department (DoJ) declined to provide a statement. It comes as Boeing announced it had reached a deal to buy the aerospace supplier Spirit AeroSystems - a move it said would improve quality and safety. Spirit made the fuselage that suffered a mid-flight blowout on an Alaska Airlines 737 Max 9 jet in January, sparking widespread concern about standards at Boeing.\\n\\n'Families will object to this deal'\\n\\nLast month, US prosecutors recommended that the DoJ bring criminal charges against the plane maker. That was after the DoJ said Boeing had violated a 2021 settlement related to the crashes which killed 346 people. \\\"The memory of 346 innocents killed by Boeing demands more justice than this,\\\" said Mr Cassell, adding that the \\\"families will strenuously object to this plea deal\\\". The plane crashes - both involving Boeing's 737 Max aircraft - occurred within six months of each other. The crash involving Indonesia's Lion Air occurred in October 2018, followed by an Ethiopian Airlines flight in March 2019. Both crashes were linked to faulty flight control systems. A letter sent last month by Mr Cassell to the DoJ revealed that the families had been seeking prosecutions of Boeing's top executives at the time of the crashes and a fine of $24.8bn (\\u00a319.6bn) for \\\"the deadliest corporate crime in US history\\\". The Justice Department has until 7 July to decide whether to revive a criminal charge of fraud brought against Boeing in 2021. That charge has lain dormant since the company acknowledged in a settlement that it had misled air-safety regulators about aspects of the 737 Max, and promised to create a new compliance system to detect and prevent further fraud. Under the deal reached in 2021, Boeing said it would pay a $2.5bn settlement and prosecutors agreed to ask the court to drop a criminal charge after three years if the company abided by certain stipulations set out in the deferred prosecution agreement. But in May, the DoJ said Boeing was in breach of the deal, stating that it had failed to \\\"design, implement, and enforce a compliance and ethics program to prevent and detect violations of the US fraud laws throughout its operations\\\".\",\n",

      "            \"body\": \"\\u201cIn this city, everyone feels the decline of the North Sea,\\u201d says Chris Douglas, 39, who has lived in Aberdeen his whole life and began working as a taxi driver in the Granite City 20 years ago. He now has his own cab company, which in the past was entirely reliant on bookings from the oil and gas industry \\u2013 today it\\u2019s \\u201cmaybe 50%\\u201d, he says.\\n\\n\\u201cYou only have to look around: there are industrial estates decimated, hotels no longer trading. The good days are long gone,\\u201d he says. \\u201cAnd no political party is coming along to say they are going to rejuvenate the industry. There are just different plans for how to close it down.\\u201d\\n\\nThe oil and gas fields in the North Sea are in terminal decline. Last year, the oil basin produced 34m tonnes of oil, its lowest since production in the North Sea was established in the 1970s. As its accessible fossil fuels dwindle, big oil companies have pulled out of the ageing oil basin. And despite the government issuing a rush of licences since Russia\\u2019s invasion of Ukraine, the amount of oil set to be extracted is rapidly shrinking.\\n\\nMeanwhile, the climate crisis \\u2013 fuelled by gas, oil and coal extraction \\u2013 is accelerating at a frightening speed and the world\\u2019s leading scientists and energy analysts are clear: there can be no new oil and gas projects if humanity is to avoid catastrophe.\\n\\nView image in fullscreen Union Street in Aberdeen\\u2019s city centre. The city prospered from North Sea oil. Photograph: Andreea Dragomir/Alamy\\n\\nIn the far north-east of Scotland, this combination of factors could spell disaster for the almost 60,000 workers supported by the oil and gas industry, their families and communities. For the past four decades they have prospered on the well-paid, secure jobs North Sea oil has provided. But now they are looking into an abyss.\\n\\n\\u201cMost of my friends went into the North Sea industry because for them, and for their fathers and their grandfathers, it has always been seen as a sure thing. Does the green economy offer that same security, the same pay?\\u201d Douglas says.\\n\\nThis is a crucial moment for these communities, according to Joe Rollin, a senior organiser at the union Unite, which represents tens of thousands of oil and gas workers. \\u201cWe simply can\\u2019t let these workers be the coalminers of this generation, with all the devastation to lives and communities that would entail,\\u201d he says.\\n\\nThis is the challenge facing politicians in Westminster and Holyrood before this week\\u2019s general election. How do they manage the inevitable and urgent decline of North Sea oil and gas \\u2013 and can they ensure a just transition to new low-carbon jobs that are fully unionised, well-paid and secure?\\n\\nFor Mika Minio-Paluello, a policy officer at the Trades Union Congress (TUC), there is a lot on the line.\\n\\n\\u201cWhatever happens to the people working in North Sea oil and gas, it is being closely watched by those in different industries and sectors \\u2013 not just across the UK but also in other countries \\u2013 to see if we can take working people on this journey.\\n\\n\\u201cIt is a test case in some ways, for the whole idea of a just transition, of what happens when we decarbonise \\u2026 we simply can\\u2019t have a repeat of what happened to coal workers in the 80s.\\u201d\\n\\nView image in fullscreen The end of the miners\\u2019 strike at Selby coalfield in Yorkshire in 1985. Many communities were decimated by pit closures under the Thatcher government. Photograph: World Image Archive/Alamy\\n\\nThe spectre of the miners\\u2019 plight after the pit closures in the 1980s hangs over this debate. The communities that were decimated when the then Conservative prime minister Margaret Thatcher closed the pits and smashed the coalminers\\u2019 union never recovered.\\n\\nArguably the stakes now are even higher. The escalating climate crisis demands a rapid end to fossil fuel production, but the populist right across Europe is on the rise and it has climate action in their sights \\u2013 describing it as a remote, elite project being done at the expense of ordinary workers.\\n\\nThe UK\\u2019s main political parties are divided on the issue. The Conservative party is still promising to \\u201cmax out\\u201d oil and gas in the North Sea by granting licences for new exploration every year. Meanwhile, Labour has promised to put an end to new licences, and raise taxes on the large profits being made by companies operating in the North Sea. The party is also promising \\u201cnot a single job\\u201d will be lost during the transition.\\n\\nIn response, the Scottish National party has U-turned on its pledge to phase out fossil fuel licences and is trying to tread a \\u201cmiddle ground\\u201d, saying it will approve licences if they meet strict climate conditions \\u2013 although most experts struggle to see how this could be possible.\\n\\nNigel Farage, the leader of the insurgent populist Reform UK party, is waiting to capitalise, vowing at his manifesto launch last month to axe net zero policies and fast-track licences to open up the North Sea.\\n\\n\\u201cIf we fail to do this transition in a way that takes communities with us, then we leave the way open for Farage and the far right,\\u201d said Minio-Paluello. \\u201cThe risk of the far right culture wars building a wave of support on the back of our failure is very, very real.\\u201d\\n\\nThere is little doubt the writing is on the wall for the industry. Experts point out that the number of jobs supported directly and indirectly by oil and gas has more than halved in the past decade \\u2013 from 441,000 to 214,00 \\u2013 during which time the government has issued roughly 400 new licences in six licensing rounds.\\n\\nAccording to the former head of the oil and gas regulator, new licences would make a difference to gas production only \\u201caround the edges\\u201d. Even BP\\u2019s former chief executive has said North Sea drilling is \\u201cnot going to make any difference\\u201d to Britain\\u2019s energy security.\\n\\nAjay Parmar, a director at ICIS, a commodity data provider, says:\\u201cThe UK\\u2019s oil supply decline has been in the works for decades. Labour\\u2019s policy will hasten the decline but only marginally.\\u201d\\n\\nView image in fullscreen Climate activists protesting against drilling in the North Sea. Photograph: Graeme Robertson/The Guardian\\n\\nCritics of the Tory pitch to \\u201cmax out\\u201d North Sea oil claim it is part of a culture war framing what will only result in workers being stranded in a declining industry with no plan to save their livelihoods or communities.\\n\\nAnalysts and trade unions agree that unless it is managed properly, the transition will have a devastating impact on the Scottish economy. According to a report by the consultancy EY, which was commissioned by the Scottish government, North Sea workers have an annual average salary of \\u00a388,000, while those working in the oil and gas supply chain earn an average of \\u00a351,000 a year. This is well above the average annual salary of \\u00a329,000 in Scotland \\u2013 and above the \\u00a342,600 average wage of employees in the clean energy sector, according to figures from the Energy and Climate Intelligence Unit.\\n\\nAs high-wage oil jobs are replaced with clean energy roles, the gross value of Scotland\\u2019s employment sector could plummet from \\u00a319bn a year in 2019 to \\u00a312bn by 2050, according to the report.\\n\\nFor people like Dale Green, who has been working on the rigs for the past 22 years, those statistics could be life-changing.\\n\\n\\u201cWhen I was growing up, the only option for me really if I wanted a good job, good money, was to work on the rigs,\\u201d says the 39-year-old scaffolder. \\u201cIt has allowed me to move on from the council estate where I grew up and to be able to afford a decent life \\u2013 to look after my children, get a house, get a car.\\u201d\\n\\nDale fears that unless the transition is properly managed the chances he has had will be denied to future generations.\\n\\n\\u201cTaking away opportunities that someone like me has enjoyed, a scaffolder from a working-class community who grew up on a council estate, it could just decimate certain areas,\\u201d said Green.\\n\\nIf it wins the election, Labour plans to set up a taskforce with Scottish Labour, the big energy companies and the unions to \\u201csecure a future for every oil and gas worker\\u201d. It says the new jobs will mostly be in renewables, carbon capture and storage, and hydrogen.\\n\\nView image in fullscreen Wind turbines at the Seagreen offshore windfarm, under construction off the coast of Montrose in the North Sea.

They argue a well-funded, pro-active industrial strategy will be required to create the jobs in wind turbine manufacturing, installation and maintenance, as well as in the wider supply chain for renewables.\\n\\nUnite says much more needs to be done. Its general secretary, Sharon Graham, refused to sign off the party\\u2019s manifesto at its \\u201cclause V\\u201d last month \\u2013 in part because of fears Labour\\u2019s plans for oil and gas workers in the North Sea were too vague.\\n\\n\\u201cWe should not be letting go of one rope until we have hold of another,\\u201d Graham said earlier this year. \\u201cThese types of transitions must have workers at the heart. Unite will not stand by and let these workers be thrown on the scrap heap.\\u201d\\n\\nThe union is running a grassroots \\u201cNo ban without a plan\\u201d campaign across north-east Scotland, urging Labour to outline more detailed and funded proposals before banning new licences. Last week, more than 200 small businesses published a letter backing the campaign and calling on Labour to spell out exactly where the jobs will come from.\\n\\nPreviously, this position might have seen trade unions pitted against climate groups calling for a rapid winding down of the industry. However, behind the scenes there has been an unlikely alliance emerging.\\n\\nLast week, 60 leading climate organisations including Greenpeace UK, Friends of the Earth England, Wales and Northern Ireland, Oxfam UK and Extinction Rebellion signed an open letter calling for a \\u201cclear and funded\\u201d transition plan for workers and communities reliant on the oil and gas industry.\\n\\nThe letter, which was sent to all party leaders, is based on a report created in consultation with workers and backed by Unite, the National Union of Rail, Maritime and Transport Workers (RMT), the Public and Commercial Services Union (PCS), and Unison Scotland.\\n\\nA spokesperson for Unite says the union welcomed \\u201csupport from the climate movement\\u201d.\\n\\n\\u201cWe are fully behind a transition to greener energy, but this must be a fair transition, one that has workers and communities at its heart \\u2026 we will continue to work with climate groups who are calling for ambitious government action on a just transition.\\u201d\\n\\nRuby Earle, from the campaign group Platform, which helped coordinate the letter, says it shows \\u201chow far the climate movement and unions have come in building relationships\\u201d.\\n\\n\\u201cGovernment support for a just transition cannot be an afterthought. A clear and funded industrial strategy, alongside publicly owned energy, is not only essential for workers, communities, and the millions of people living in fuel poverty, but also to ensure the transition happens within climate limits.\\u201d\\n\\nJake Molloy, a former oil and gas worker and trade unionist for almost 20 years, who now sits on the Scottish government\\u2019s Just Transition Commission, is at the sharp end of this emerging coalition.\\n\\n\\u201cIf I had suggested, 20 years ago [to his colleagues in the industry] that they go and meet Greenpeace or another climate group, they would have thought I meant for a fight because these groups were seen as wanting to destroy our jobs, our communities.\\u201d\\n\\nBut he says that has changed in recent years, with a huge amount of work going on behind the scenes. Molloy says this has resulted in more climate groups recognising that the necessary transition away from fossil fuels cannot be done at the expense of ordinary working people. At the same time, some unions and workers have accepted that the transition is necessary and \\u2013 if done correctly \\u2013 positive.\\n\\n\\u201cMore and more people on both sides are realising that this is an industrial revolution on an unprecedented scale and that we need change \\u2013 change so fundamental as to strip away the ideology that we\\u2019ve worked in for the last 40 years.\\u201d\\n\\nMolloy warns that many of the much-heralded \\u201cnew jobs\\u201d in renewables do not exist in Scotland \\u2013 citing a recent windfarm development that has been built, installed and maintained entirely by overseas companies and governments.\\n\\nTessa Khan, the director of campaign group Uplift, says the next government needs to \\u201cget everyone around the table \\u2013 the Scottish government, trade unions, worker representatives and affected communities \\u2013 to come up with a coherent plan that works in everyone\\u2019s interests\\u201d.\\n\\nCrucially, she says, the transition plans must be taken out of the hands of the oil and gas industry.\\n\\n\\u201cThe majority of operators in the basin invest nothing in UK renewable energy, but nor are they investing in UK oil and gas production. The record profits of recent years have gone to their shareholders, not to investment in the transition. [They] aren\\u2019t interested in creating clean jobs and growing the UK economy but in making as much money as they can for themselves, for as long they can get away with it.\\u201d\\n\\nLast month the supreme court in London ruled the climate impact of burning oil and gas must be taken into account when deciding whether to approve projects.\\n\\nExperts say this is likely to be another nail in the coffin of North Sea oil and gas, making it it harder to secure new licences. It could even threaten some of those that have been approved, including the controversial Rosebank oil and gas field, to be operated by the Norwegian company Equinor.\\n\\nA Labour source said if the party did form the next government, and Rosebank was still in the balance, then ministers could refuse the remaining consents it needed to operate.\\n\\nMolloy, who has spent years working on a just transition for his colleagues in the industry, says whatever the result in the election it is essential that politicians and corporations are not able to pit those worried about the climate crisis against those who want to ensure a decent future for workers, their families and communities.\\n\\n\\u201cI\\u2018ve got four grandsons who will never forgive me if I get this wrong, and I\\u2019ve been trying for considerable time to get it right, because their future \\u2013 and that of millions around the world \\u2013 relies on us getting this right.\\u201d\",\n",

      "            \"body\": \"Would new licences save the North Sea oil and gas industry?\\n\\n4 days ago By Kevin Keane , BBC Scotland environment correspondent Share\\n\\nPA Media Surfers in Aberdeen stage a protest on the beach calling for an end to new oil and gas licensing\\n\\n\\\"Do you support new oil and gas licences, yes or no?\\\" That's the binary question which has been at the centre of the political debate in Scotland since parties began preparing to fight the general election. Political leaders have been hurling accusations that 100,000 jobs in Scotland will be at risk if no more licences are issued. But that figure is 40,000 more than the total number of people in Scotland whose roles currently rely directly or indirectly on fossil fuel extraction. And analysis by BBC Scotland News suggests that new licences will only extend the life of the North Sea by up to five years at today's production levels. The North Sea Transition Authority (NSTA) - which issues licences - estimates that about two billion barrels of \\\"unlicenced\\\" oil remains. Last year the industry produced 440 million barrels.\\n\\nEnvironmentalists have been campaigning for governments to stop issuing exploration licences which allow oil companies to search for new discoveries of fossil fuels. The industry says without new oil finds, the rate at which the sector declines will accelerate - putting jobs at risk. It is now 25 years since production peaked in the North Sea. In 1999, the equivalent of about 1.7 billion barrels of oil and gas was pumped ashore. Output had dropped to 884 million barrels by 2010, then plummeted further to 552 million in 2022, a fall of about 67% on peak levels. Government predictions suggest output will halve again by 2030 to 251 million barrels and fall as low as 58 million by 2050 - which is just 3% of peak production. That's because when the oil boom came we targeted the biggest reserves first which were easiest to exploit.\\n\\nNowadays, operators are focused on the remaining smaller wells and using much more advanced - and expensive - techniques to extract it. While the North Sea Transition Authority estimates that the UK has around 10 to 15 billion barrels of oil and gas remaining, only about two billion are in areas where the UK government has so far not issued licences for operators to explore. The suggestion that 100,000 North Sea jobs could be at risk without new exploration licences came from Aberdeen and Grampian Chamber of Commerce. Using data from the investment banking firm Stifel, it produced a report last month saying the next Westminster government had \\\"just 100 days to save 100,000 jobs\\\" in the industry across the UK. During the general election campaign the Conservatives and SNP have repeatedly asserted that by promising to end exploration licences, their opponents risk 100,000 Scottish jobs.\\n\\nRenewables industries like offshore wind are expected to ramp up this decade\\n\\nThe Conservatives fully support continued licences while the SNP say applications should be considered on a case-by-case basis. Labour has said it will issue no more licences and the Liberal Democrats believe the focus should be on creating more jobs in renewable energy like wind power. The Scottish Greens would go furthest of all, by rescinding recently issued licences including 54 which were granted in October and January. Offshore Energies UK estimates that there are now only 60,700 people in Scotland who work directly or indirectly in oil and gas. That number rises to 120,000 across the UK as a whole. Research by Robert Gordon University (RGU) estimates that in the worst case scenario the number of oil and gas jobs lost in the UK by 2030 could reach 60,000. It predicts that even on a best case scenario, with new licenses continuing and investment returning, some 33,000 jobs will still go as a result of falling oil and gas production. So by their estimate, the actual number of jobs \\\"at risk\\\" is 27,000 across the whole UK, not just Scotland.\\n\\nJob forecasts\",\n",
