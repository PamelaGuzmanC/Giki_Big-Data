      "            \"body\": \"U.S. President Joe Biden attends the first presidential debate hosted by CNN in Atlanta, Georgia, U.S., June 27, 2024. Marco Bello | Reuters\\n\\nPresident Joe Biden's raspy, unfocused, often inarticulate and widely panned debate performance stoked deep anxiety among Democrats \\u2014 and caused some commentators and fundraisers to openly call for a new nominee to run against former President Donald Trump. But replacing Biden as the party's pick less than five months out from Election Day carries enormous political risks and would be difficult, if not impossible, to pull off. Right now, the only likely way Biden could be replaced is if he willingly ends his campaign. And Biden's aides and top Democratic officials say the 81-year-old incumbent has no plans to do so. If he did drop out, Democrats have yet to identify a clear alternative candidate to swap in. But the panic among donors and party officials after watching Biden falter Thursday night in his debate against Trump has led some of them to take steps to get Biden out of the race. There are already discussions among Democratic fundraisers about trying to convince congressional leaders \\u2014 Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer in particular \\u2014 to urge Biden to announce to drop out, according to people familiar with the matter who were granted anonymity to speak freely.\\n\\nUS President Joe Biden, with Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer (L), speaks to the press after meeting with the Senate Democratic caucus to build support for his infrastructure and economic investment goals during the Democratic luncheon at the US Capitol on July 13, 2021 in Washington, DC, July 14, 2021. Saul Loeb | AFP | Getty Images\\n\\nSchumer, D-N.Y., is a top target for donors making that pitch because he privately has voiced concerns about Biden's standings in presidential election polls, those people said. Schumer was worried before the debate that Biden and Trump were statistically tied nationally, despite the Republican challenger's conviction in his New York criminal hush money trial. A spokesman for Schumer declined to comment to CNBC but pointed to a social media post the majority leader published after the debate. Schumer in that X post wrote: \\\"Tonight's debate made the choice clear: Four more years of progress, or four more years of attacks on our fundamental rights and our democracy.\\\" \\\"We've got to get out the vote for Joe Biden, Kamala Harris, and a Democratic Senate and House!\\\" the post said. That spin has not alleviated the post-debate anxiety felt by some of the president's top fundraisers. Some of those wealthy donors have lost trust in Biden's team, believing they were given false assurances about Biden's ability to take on Trump. And some of those donors who already planned to attend a high-dollar fundraiser Saturday in the Hamptons section of Long Island say they will attend the event to judge for themselves whether Biden can continue as a viable candidate. \\\"Democrats are in a very difficult situation because it's late in the campaign for a change,\\\" said Meena Bose, director of the Peter S. Kalikow Center for the Study of the American Presidency at Hofstra University, in an interview with CNBC. The only feasible way Bose could see it playing out is with Biden throwing his full support behind Vice President Kamala Harris to become the new nominee.\\n\\nU.S. Vice President Kamala Harris gives remarks on conflict-related sexual violence at an event in the Eisenhower Executive Office Building on June 17, 2024 in Washington, DC. Anna Moneymaker | Getty Images\\n\\nOtherwise, Democrats have a wide-open nomination fight just a few months before the Nov. 5 election, she said. Bose called that a \\\"disastrous\\\" prospect.\\\" \\\"Vice President Harris is a risky choice, but certainly has the visibility and is the logical choice,\\\" said Bose. \\\"It's difficult to see how you open up the Democratic presidential nomination now and have a unified path to victory in November,\\\" she added.\\n\\nHowever, even if Biden backed Harris to replace him ahead of the Democratic National Convention in August, there is no guarantee that the delegates he has won so far will shift their support to her. Biden has won nearly all of the roughly 4,000 Democratic-pledged delegates, far exceeding the threshold to make him the party nominee. If Biden refuses to drop out before August, the only opportunity to boot him as nominee would be at the Democratic National Convention that month. It is technically possible that Biden's delegates could abandon him en masse then and throw open the convention to nominate another candidate. Some Democrats who want an alternative to Biden but are concerned about Harris' relatively low opinion polls and rocky campaign history have looked to California Gov. Gavin Newsom, Ohio Sen. Sherrod Brown, Illinois Gov. J.B. Pritzker and others as possible contenders.\\n\\nCalifornia Governor Gavin Newsom (D) reacts as he speaks to the members of the press on the day of the first presidential debate hosted by CNN in Atlanta, Georgia, U.S., June 27, 2024. REUTERS/Marco Bello Marco Bello | Reuters\\n\\nBut blocking Biden from the nomination is highly improbable, as delegates tend to be strong supporters of their chosen candidate. \\\"That is probably the worst-case scenario,\\\" Bose said. \\\"If the Democrats are going to have a change at the top of the ticket, President Biden has to endorse it and, frankly, probably initiate it.\\\" The DNC rules allow for the party to select another presidential nominee, but only in the \\\"event of death, resignation or disability\\\" that leaves the role vacant.\\n\\nwatch now\",\n",

      "            \"body\": \"President Joe Biden\\u2019s family used a Sunday gathering at Camp David to urge him to stay in the race and keep fighting despite his dreadful debate performance, and some members criticized how his staff prepared him for the faceoff, according to four people familiar with the discussions.\\n\\nBiden spent the day sequestered with first lady Jill Biden, his children and grandchildren. It was a previously scheduled trip to the presidential retreat in Maryland for a photo shoot with Annie Leibovitz for the upcoming Democratic National Convention.\\n\\nBut the gathering was also an exercise in trying to figure out how to quell Democratic anxiety that has exploded following Thursday\\u2019s performance.\\n\\nWhile his family was aware of how poorly he performed against Donald Trump, they also continue to think he\\u2019s the best person to beat the Republican presumptive nominee. They also believe he is capable of doing the job of president for another four years, according to the people who were not authorized to speak publicly about internal discussions and spoke to The Associated Press on condition of anonymity.\\n\\nAmong the most vocal: Jill Biden and son Hunter, whom the president has long gone to for counsel and advice. Both believe the president shouldn\\u2019t bow out when he\\u2019s down, and believe that he can come back from what they see as one subpar performance. The family questioned how he was prepared for the debate by staff and wondered if they could have done something better, the people said.\\n\\nBiden\\u2019s campaign has spent the days since the debate \\u2014 where he appeared raspy, trailed off, and at times gave convoluted answers \\u2014 working to keep donors and surrogates on board as Democrats increasingly questioned whether he should stay in the race.\\n\\nAt this point in the delegate process, Biden would likely have to decide to drop out for there to be a new nominee. And the people he listens to most in the world \\u2014 his wife and son \\u2014 are telling him to stay in.\\n\\nEven before the debate, the age of the 81-year-old Democratic president had been a liability with voters, and the prime-time faceoff appeared to reinforce the public\\u2019s deep-seated concerns before perhaps the largest audience he will have in the four months until Election Day. CNN said more than 51 million people watched the debate.\\n\\nWhile the president was huddled with his family, prominent Democrats rallied to deliver a public show of support for his campaign on Sunday.\\n\\n\\u201cI do not believe that Joe Biden has a problem leading for the next four years,\\u201d said one close ally, Democratic Rep. James Clyburn of South Carolina. \\u201cJoe Biden should continue to run on his record.\\u201d\\n\\nSen. Raphael Warnock, a Georgia Democrat and Baptist minister, said there had been \\u201cmore than a few Sundays when I wish I had preached a better sermon,\\u201d relating the experience to Biden\\u2019s debate performance.\\n\\n\\u201cBut after the sermon was over, it was my job to embody the message, to show up for the people that I serve. And that\\u2019s what Joe Biden has been doing his entire life,\\u201d Warnock said. It was an echo of the message from other supporters that Biden had a bad debate, but a lifetime of good governance.\\n\\nWarnock, like Clyburn and others, pivoted to Trump\\u2019s many falsehoods during the debate \\u2014 lapses that Biden and the debate moderators often failed to fact check from the stage \\u2014 including about the Jan. 6, 2021, attack on the Capitol by Trump supporters, immigration and the outcome of the 2020 election.\\n\\n\\u201cWhenever his mouth was moving, he was lying,\\u201d Warnock said of Trump.\\n\\nBut concern simmered among some Democrats that Biden\\u2019s campaign and the Democratic National Committee were not taking seriously enough the impact of the debate.\\n\\nFormer Iowa Sen. Tom Harkin, who served for more than two decades with Biden in the Senate, called the debate \\u201ca disaster from which Biden cannot recover.\\u201d\\n\\nHarkin suggested that Democratic senators in pivotal races and \\u201cmaybe all incumbent Democratic Senators should pen a letter to Biden asking him to release his delegates and step aside so the convention can choose a new candidate,\\u201d according to an email to supporters that was obtained by The Associated Press. It was first referenced in Iowa journalist Julie Gammack\\u2019s column on Saturday, Iowa Potluck.\\n\\n\\u201cThis is a perilous time, and is more important than the ego or desires of Joe Biden to stay as President,\\u201d Harkin concluded.\\n\\nRep. Jamie Raskin, D-Md., described \\u201cvery honest, serious and rigorous conversations taking place at every level of our party \\u2026 about what to do.\\u201d\\n\\nBut DNC Chairman Jaime Harrison and Biden\\u2019s campaign manager, Julie Chavez Rodriguez, held a Saturday afternoon call with dozens of committee members across the country \\u2014 a group of some of the most influential members of the party \\u2014 where they offered a rosy assessment of the path forward and gave no opportunity for others on the call to respond with questions.\\n\\nMultiple committee members on the call, most granted anonymity to talk about the private discussion, described feeling like they were being asked to ignore a serious predicament.\\n\\n\\u201cThere were a number of things that could have been said in addressing the situation. But we didn\\u2019t get that. We were being gaslit,\\u201d said Joe Salazar, an elected DNC member from Colorado, who was on the call.\",\n",

Other elements that will close include the harbour, sinter plant, ore yards and primary steelmaking, bringing to a halt more than 70 years of steelmaking in Port Talbot.\\n\\nThe plans were brought forward after the Unite union announced indefinite strike action beginning on 8 July. Tata said it could not \\u201csafely and stably\\u201d operate the plant during any strike, and it has brought forward complete closure of the second furnace to as early as next Sunday 7 July.\\n\\nThe new electric furnace is not due to come onstream until 2027 and unions want steelmaking to continue until then.

In a letter to the UK Steel Committee, which represents the Community, Unite and the GMB unions, the company is believed to have offered to discuss future investment in Port Talbot. But the unions would be required to suspend future industrial action. Unite general secretary Sharon Graham told BBC Wales: \\\"They suspend closure, we suspend action.\\\"\\n\\nUnite workers are set to start striking on 8 July over Tata\\u2019s plans to cut 2,800 UK jobs.

Community and GMB have a mandate from their members for strike action but have not confirmed any dates, saying they would wait until after the general election before announcing their next moves. The offer to start fresh talks with the unions follows discussions between Tata and Unite in the days since announcing the proposal to bring forward the closures of both Port Talbot blast furnaces. On Thursday the company said it would close both furnaces this week unless it could \\\"safely and stably operate\\\" them during the strike. On Sunday it wrote to all three unions, offering to begin new talks if the strike was called off. The talks are not a renegotiation of the existing plan, but focus on future investment opportunities. Alun Davies, Community\\u2019s national officer, said the letter \\\"simply reaffirms\\\" the position agreed by the unions and Tata at their last meeting on 22 May, and did not constitute a new agreement in response to Unite's actions. Unite had previously pulled away from multi-union talks, and was the only union to launch industrial action.

The company had originally been planning to shut one of the blast furnaces by the end of June and the second one by September. But Port Talbot workers have been told that because of the strike from 8 July, the company can no longer be assured of sufficient resources being available to ensure safe and stable operations. The Unite union said Tata's statement to shut or pause the blast furnaces three months earlier than intended was the latest in a long line of threats and it would not deter them. The Welsh government said it cannot and will not support the closure of both blast furnaces.\\n\\nLast week the Unite union announced that about 1,500 workers would begin an indefinite strike on 8 July over the company's plans to cut thousands of jobs. Onay Kasab, the national lead for Unite, told Radio Wales Breakfast that the union was due to have a conversation with the company regarding safety during the strike. Mr Kasab denied if the union had given the company an opportunity to shut the site. \\\"What other option have we got when we are facing 2,800 job losses. We have said to Tata, again and again, 'wait for a general election, wait for a new Labour government'\\\" he said. Mr Kasab said the union have a letter from the company asking the union to wait until after the general election for discussions to take place. However, the company previously said it would not be changing course in Port Talbot, regardless of who wins the general election. About 2,800 Tata Steel workers will lose their jobs when the company closes both blast furnaces in Port Talbot by the end of September. At the time, the company said if the strike affected the safety or stability of its operations it would be \\\"forced\\\" to accelerate closure plans. A spokesperson for Tata said: \\\"Following the announcement by Unite union to unilaterally call strike action from 8 July, Tata Steel is unfortunately forced to commence legal action to challenge the validity of Unite's ballot. \\\"In the coming days, if we cannot be certain that we are able to continue to safely and stably operate our assets through the period of strike action, we will not have any choice but to pause or stop heavy end operations [including both blast furnaces] on the Port Talbot site. \\\"That is not a decision we would take lightly, and we recognise that it would prove extremely costly and disruptive throughout the supply chain, but the safety of people on or around our sites will always take priority over everything else.\\\" Tata said it is again calling on Unite to withdraw its industrial action and join Community and GMB unions in \\\"giving consideration\\\" to the company's proposal, which Tata said includes \\\"generous employee support packages, training and skills development\\\". It said it \\\"understands\\\" the impact the restructuring will have on many employees and contractors, but that it \\\"remains committed to a just transition\\\" and hopes for a \\\"long and sustainable future\\\" in the UK. The company plans to build a \\u00a31.25bn electric arc furnace to produce steel in a way which is less polluting than traditional blast furnaces but requires fewer workers. Tata said the move would secure the future of steelmaking at the site and the UK government is contributing \\u00a3500m towards the cost of the project. The plans for the site will see both furnaces shut down. Number five will go off by the end of next week as planned while four is due to go off by the end of September. Preparatory work to shut down five will begin by 1 July if the strike goes ahead. Other elements that will close include the harbour, sinter plant, ore yards and primary steelmaking.\\n\\nPA Media Unite union workers are protesting against Tata Steel's plans to cut 2,800 jobs\\n\\nSharon Graham, the Unite general secretary, said the union is \\\"fighting for the future of the steel industry\\\". She said Unite has secured \\\"serious investment\\\" from Labour to safeguard jobs. \\\"Tata putting out a statement to shut or pause its blast furnaces three months earlier than they intended to is the latest in a long line of threats that won't deter us. \\\"The Unite campaign is not about selling jobs, it's about securing the long-term future of steel making in this country for thousands of workers in Port Talbot and South Wales.\\\" Unite said it is calling on the \\\"real decision makers\\\" in Mumbai to realise that \\\"the investment secured will be good for the company and workers.\\\" GMB union said Tata must \\\"step back\\\" from this \\\"irreversible decision\\\" and instead \\\"safeguard steelmaking assets\\\". GMB national officer, Charlotte Brumpton-Childs, said that the upcoming general election could \\\"change so much\\\", and that GMB's next actions would be decided by its members. The Community union condemned Tata's \\\"unacceptable\\\" decision to bring forward the closure and said it continued to support the Labour Party's call for Tata not to make irreversible decisions before the general election.\\n\\nAnalysis by Ben Price, BBC Wales News\\n\\nDevelopments have escalated quickly in the past two weeks. Unite is one of three unions which represents steelworkers and it has so far been the most militant in its action in the face of significant job cuts across Tata\\u2019s UK operations. Members are currently working to rule and there\\u2019s a ban on any overtime. However, the decision to walk out indefinitely is an escalation which now potentially threatens the early closure of the UK\\u2019s largest steelmaking operation in Port Talbot. Tata says it would have no option but to close if the strike goes ahead, but in the meantime the company has filed for an injunction at the High Court to try to prevent the strike happening. It suggests Unite\\u2019s ballot on industrial action wasn\\u2019t carried out properly. With the action due on 8 July, Tata will need a ruling quickly. The other unions, Community and GMB, say they\\u2019ll wait until after the general election before deciding whether to strike too. But having spoken to a number of steelworkers in Port Talbot, the sense is that many don\\u2019t want a strike which could cost them the current offer on the table from the company. What happens during the course of the next week could be crucial to the future of thousands of livelihoods, although Tata says no redundancies will be made until the end of September, regardless.\\n\\nWorkers and local people have protested about the closure plans\\n\\nFirst Minister Vaughan Gething described the news from Tata as \\\"extraordinary\\\" and urged the company to wait for the result of next week's general election. In a statement, Mr Gething said: \\\"The news that Tata could switch off blast furnaces four and five at Port Talbot next week is extraordinary and will cause huge anxiety for the workforce, their families and the community. \\\"The Welsh government cannot and will not support the closure of both blast furnaces\\\". He added that acting whilst the nation went to the polls did not help de-escalate matters. Samuel Kurtz, the Welsh Conservative shadow minister for economy and energy,said it was \\\"disappointing news that will cause additional distress to communities already dealing with enough as it is\\\". \\\"Tata have shown no goodwill to their workforce at what is an anxious time. \\u201cThe Welsh Labour government have also only paid lip service to Tata's workforce, failing to contribute a penny to the transition board, and UK Labour's manifesto says nothing on what it would do differently to support Port Talbot's steelworkers,\\\" he added. Luke Fletcher, Plaid Cymru's economy spokesperson, said steel should be brought under the control of the next UK government, which Plaid believes will be led by Sir Keir Starmer. Mr Fletcher said: \\\"The time has come now for an incoming Labour government to put words into action on steel. \\\"Save our steel is no good as just a slogan, if we are going to save our steel, nationalisation needs to happen on day one.\\\"\",\n",

      "            \"body\": \"High mortgage rates pricing out buyers, says Nationwide\\n\\n4 hours ago By Nick Edser , Business reporter, BBC News Share\\n\\nGetty Images\\n\\nHigh mortgage rates mean affordability is still \\\"stretched\\\" for many home buyers, according to the Nationwide. The building society said that while earnings had been rising faster than house prices in recent years, this had not been enough to offset the impact of more expensive mortgages. Its comments came as it said house price growth had been \\\"broadly stable\\\" in June, with prices up 0.2% from the previous month. The average house price is now \\u00a3266,064, the lender said.\\n\\nPrices were up 1.5% from a year earlier, but Nationwide said activity in the housing market had been \\\"broadly flat\\\" over the past 12 months, with transactions down by about 15% compared with 2019. The lender said the market was still being affected by the increase in mortgage rates, which started climbing after the Bank of England began to raise its key interest rate in late 2021. Robert Gardner, Nationwide's chief economist, said that mortgage rates are \\\"still well above the record lows prevailing in 2021 in the wake of the pandemic\\\". \\\"For example, the interest rate on a five-year fixed rate mortgage for a borrower with a 25% deposit was 1.3% in late 2021, but in recent months this has been nearer to 4.7%. \\\"As a result, housing affordability is still stretched.\\\" Nationwide's figures are based on the building society's own mortgage lending, which does not include buyers who purchase homes with cash, or buy-to-let deals. Cash buyers account for about a third of housing sales. The impact of higher borrowing costs can be seen in the fact that transactions involving a mortgage are down by nearly 25% over the past year, Nationwide said. Meanwhile the number of cash transactions for properties is about 5% higher than pre-pandemic levels. Across the UK, Northern Ireland saw the biggest price increases, up 4.1% from a year earlier. Wales and Scotland both saw a 1.4% annual rise. Prices in England climbed by 0.6%, with northern regions seeing bigger increases in general than the south.\\n\\nDespite some major lenders cutting their mortgage rates last week, home loan costs remain far higher than pre-pandemic levels. According to financial information service Moneyfacts, the average rate on a two-year fixed mortgage deal stands at 5.95%, while for a five-year deal the average is 5.53%. The focus is now on the Bank of England's Monetary Policy Committee (MPC), which sets interest rates, to see if it decides to cut at its next meeting on 1 August. June's MPC meeting saw a change in tone from policymakers, with suggestions that the Bank could vote for a rate cut next month. \\\"Buyers may find their mojo again when we get a rate cut from the Bank of England,\\\" said Sarah Coles, head of personal finance at Hargreaves Lansdown. \\\"This could come as early as August, although sticky services inflation and higher wages could mean we need to wait until the autumn. \\\"Either way, we\\u2019re not expecting massive overnight drops in mortgage rates, so the reaction is more likely to be a muted upturn in sentiment than an overwhelming wave of optimism.\\\" Last week, the Bank said that about three million households are set to see their mortgage payments rise in the next two years. These are homeowners who arranged mortgage deals before the Bank started to lift rates in 2021. These deals are now expiring, and the Bank said the majority will finish before the end of 2026. For the typical household looking for a new deal, monthly mortgage repayments are forecast to increase by about \\u00a3180, or about 28%, the Bank said. However, for around 400,000 households, monthly payments could jump by 50% or more. Bank of England figures released on Monday showed a small fall in the number of mortgages approved in May, down to 60,000 from 60,800 in April. However, the data also showed the amount borrowed through mortgages dropped sharply to \\u00a31.2bn in May, from \\u00a32.2bn the month before, although this does not include those remortgaging with the same lender.\\n\\nWays to make your mortgage more affordable\",\n",

      "            \"title\": \"Why Nike Shares Plummeted Following Earnings (NYSE:NKE)\",\n",
      "            \"body\": \"sportpoint/iStock via Getty Images\\n\\nI last reported on Nike (NYSE:NKE) at the end of March. In that article, I rated the stock as a Hold. The basis for my rating was largely related to the share valuation, but I voiced additional concerns regarding the company\\u2019s long-term prospects. While there are many pros to consider when one evaluates Nike as a prospective investment, I questioned whether the company could continue its historic 10% sales growth, and I also contended that Nike\\u2019s moat is more vulnerable than others claim.\\n\\nOn Thursday, Nike (NKE) provided Q4 earnings, and the stock plummeted 20% after earnings debuted. That marked the worst single day drop in the company's history.\\n\\nSales were up an anemic 1% for the fiscal year. Excluding the years marked by COVID and the 2008 financial crisis, fiscal year 2024 marked the worst sales growth for Nike in over two decades.\\n\\nAt first glance, it might seem a bit puzzling that the stock took such a swoon following earnings. After all, Nike beat the Wall Street EPS estimate by a wide margin and came close to matching consensus for revenue. However, management\\u2019s commentary coupled with guidance for the coming fiscal year spoke volumes.\\n\\nWhat Earnings Tell Us\\n\\nNike\\u2019s non-GAAP EPS of $1.01 was well above analysts\\u2019 $0.83 estimate. However,\\n\\n$12.6 billion in reported revenue missed consensus by $250 million.\\n\\nFor the full fiscal year, Nike reported revenue of $51.4 billion. Although this was short of the $51.6 consensus, non-GAAP EPS of $3.95 beat analysts\\u2019 $3.70 estimate.\\n\\nReviewing results by category, NIKE Brand sales fell 1% to $12.1 billion, and NIKE Direct sales slumped by 8% to $5.1 billion from lower sales in NIKE owned stores as well as a drop in digital sales.\\n\\nWholesale revenues increased by 5% to $7.1 billion for the quarter.\\n\\nWholesale sales dropped by 5%, and sales of the Converse line fell a whopping 18% .\\n\\nBy region, North America footwear sales fell 6%, but apparel climbed 4%, and equipment sales increased by 47%.\\n\\nIn toto, North American sales were down 1% to $5.28 billion.\\n\\nSales of footwear in China increased 2% while apparel sales were up 5%. As in North America, equipment sales surged, jumping 28%.\\n\\nAdjusted for currency, Nike recorded a 3% sales increase in China.\\n\\nAlthough NIKE Direct sales fell 8%, total revenue in EMEA increased 1%. Sales in NIKE stores grew 1% but NIKE Digital declined 14%. Wholesale sales were up 7%.\\n\\nWorldwide, sales of footwear declined by 4%, apparel sales were up 3%, and equipment sales increased by 34%. Across all categories, total sales were down by 1%.\\n\\nIt should be noted that while less than 5% of total sales are generated by equipment, footwear generates just over two thirds of Nike\\u2019s revenue.\\n\\nOn a positive note, management touted lower logistics costs that resulted in a 110-basis point increase in gross margin to 44.7%.\\n\\nSince analysts were not forecasting a big surge in revenue, the 1% drop in sales and the modest revenue miss can\\u2019t explain the dramatic drop in the share price since earnings debuted.\\n\\nI\\u2019ll opine that management\\u2019s guidance for a 10% decline in revenue in Q1 and a mid-single-digit percentage sales decline for FY 2025 is the primary cause of the stock\\u2019s drop.\\n\\nThe Pros And Cons Of An Investment In Nike\\n\\nA year\\u2019s results do not an investment make, let alone those of a single quarter. One can easily argue that the firm is simply going through a rough spot, and in time it will provide investors with market-beating returns.\\n\\nThe company absolutely dominates the competition. As I reported in my most recent Nike article, Interbrand estimates Nike's brand is worth $53.77 billion, and a study by Piper Sandler revealed that over a third of US teens rank Nike as their top apparel brand, and almost two-thirds of those rank Nike as their favorite footwear.\\n\\nFurthermore, one should not underestimate the ubiquity of Nike\\u2019s brand when assessing the threat posed by smaller competitors. Nike has over 1,000 company stores plus another 6,000 locations operated by franchisees.\\n\\nBear with me as I insert some hopefully useful anecdotal information. A once avid runner, after a multiyear pause, I\\u2019ve worked myself back into racing condition. As I have several old injuries that can resurface, I researched the best training and racing shoes to fit my needs.\\n\\nI then bought a pair of Hoka Mach 5s over the internet. Good shoe, but to my chagrin, a size 13 in this brand doesn\\u2019t quite fit me.\\n\\nI then searched high and low for a retailer that carries ASIC Novablasts (the closest store carrying ASIC is about 35 miles away). I bought a pair, and I find Novablast to be a great shoe. I record faster times with the ASIC, and my old injuries don\\u2019t flare up. Furthermore, they are extraordinarily comfortable for everyday wear.\\n\\nHowever, there is a downside to this story. That distant store only carries a couple of size thirteens, and that means I must settle for whatever color and/or style is available (uhm, one color, one style). Unfortunately, the shoes draw quite a bit of unwanted attention and comments. Let\\u2019s just say, \\u201cthey have flare?\\u201d\\n\\nMy point being that many of Nike\\u2019s competitors have a steep hurdle to conquer to simply make their products available at the same scale as that of Nike\\u2019s.\\n\\nNow consider that Morningstar reports that Nike\\u2019s revenue is more than double that of the second largest sportswear retailer, adidas (OTCQX:ADDDF), and that in 2023, Nike footwear sales were greater than Adidas, Under Armour (UAA) and Puma combined.\\n\\nVeteran investors understand that scale provides advantages on several levels, lowering costs in advertising, from suppliers, and oftentimes for logistics.\\n\\nHowever, Nike\\u2019s success also creates a problem of sorts. Nike is huge, and that makes it difficult for the company to continue to grow at a robust pace.\\n\\nAnother negative is that several brands are gaining traction. Smaller competitors are eroding Nike\\u2019s market share, and I would argue that along with the aforementioned need to grow at an ever-higher pace, these are the top problems for investors in the stock.\\n\\nIt\\u2019s still the undoubted leader in market share terms, but in terms of the growth profile, Nike\\u2019s performance can best be described as \\u2018lackluster. Neil Saunders with GlobalData.\\n\\nYipiData\\n\\nIn addition to the fierce competition in the space, Nike is looking to China to spur growth, and success there is far from assured.\\n\\nChina should remain volatile with risk of share loss to local brands, and promo posture could increase ahead, dampening margins. Jefferies analysts\\n\\nFurthermore, the footwear market is projected to grow at a moderate pace over the next few years. Statista estimates a CAGR of 3.43% for the global footwear market through 2028.\\n\\nThe forecast by GRAND VIEW RESEARCH is a bit more sanguine. That firm projects the global footwear market will record a CAGR of 4.3% through 2030.\\n\\nDebt, Dividend, And Valuation\\n\\nInvestors need not worry over Nike\\u2019s financial foundation. The company\\u2019s debt is rated AA-, a high grade/investment grade rating. Cash and equivalents and short-term investments at the end of Q4 were $11.6 billion, up $0.9 billion from last year.\\n\\nNike currently yields 1.55%. With a payout ratio just below 40% and the 5-year dividend growth rate of roughly 11%, the dividend is safe and will likely grow at a robust pace for the foreseeable future.\\n\\nNike currently trades for $76.32 per share.\\n\\nAfter the earnings report, nearly a dozen analysts lowered their price target on the stock, with J.P. Morgan downgrading Nike to a Neutral rating from Overweight and Stifel lowering the stock from a prior Buy rating to a Hold rating. Stifel also dropped its price target to $88 from $117.\\n\\nMorgan Stanley dropped Nike from Overweight to Equal weight, while UBS provides a Hold rating on the stock.\\n\\nCommentary from the last two rating agencies speaks volumes, with Alex Stratton of Morgan Stanley stating, \\u201crecent performance has been riddled with quarterly misses & guidance cuts\\u201d and that \\u201cNKE\\u2019s long-term growth & profitability trajectory is subsequently both unclear & lower than our prior assumption.\\u201d\\n\\nJay Sole of UBS also noted that Nike\\u2019s \\u201c...fundamental trends are much worse than we realized. Our key conclusion is there will be no quick rebound for Nike\\u2019s earnings.\\\".\\n\\nNKE has a forward P/E of 26.15x, well below the average P/E for the stock over the last 5 years of 35.60x. The 5-year PEG ratio of 2.06x is also well below the 5-year average for that metric of 2.62x.\\n\\nIs Nike A Buy, Sell, Or Hold?\\n\\nThere is no doubt that Nike has one of the most powerful brands in the world. The company ranks as the largest athletic footwear brand in every major category and every major market.\\n\\nHowever, competition in this space is fierce, and sales growth for Nike is far from assured. As noted above, during the earnings call, management guided for a 10% decline in sales for the coming quarter, and a mid-single-digit percentage sales decline for this fiscal year.\\n\\nI\\u2019ve made the point that one advantage Nike has over smaller competitors is the vast geographic scale in terms of the company\\u2019s brick and mortar presence. However, Nike\\u2019s share of l the digital market fell to 32.5%, versus a 34.1% share in the comparable quarter.\\n\\nI\\u2019ll also use Hoka (DECK) to contrast Nike\\u2019s recent results with that of smaller competitors. While Nike\\u2019s North American footwear revenue dropped by 6% this quarter compared to Q4 of 2023, Hoka\\u2019s sales surged 34% in that same time frame.\\n\\nIf you take a look at Nike\\u2019s investor relations website, the first thing you\\u2019ll see, in big, bold capital letters, is \\u201cNIKE, INC. IS A GROWTH COMPANY.\\u201d\\n\\nHowever, therein lies a problem. Arguably the greatest potential downside for investors is that Nike\\u2019s success means it takes more growth to drive the stock higher.\\n\\nWhile I\\u2019ll readily concede that Nike is a quality company that dominates its market, I question whether it can sustain the growth rates we\\u2019ve witnessed over the past years.\\n\\nI rate Nike as a HOLD.\\n\\nI will add that I would not be surprised if the share price increases markedly by year\\u2019s end. However, I am largely a buy and hold investor, and I invest seeking safe, long-term results. Therefore, I don\\u2019t hold a position in NKE, and I have no intention to initiate an investment in the company for the foreseeable future.\",\n",

      "            \"body\": \"Justices reject plan to shield Sacklers in Purdue opioid deal\\n\\n4 days ago By Natalie Sherman , BBC News Share\\n\\nEPA Campaigners and family members of those who have died of opioids outside the US Supreme Court\\n\\nThe US Supreme Court has struck down a part of the bankruptcy deal for Purdue Pharma that would have shielded members of the Sackler family from future lawsuits over their role in fuelling the opioid crisis. The Sacklers, who owned and operated the Oxycontin-maker for decades, had agreed to pay $6bn (\\u00a34.7bn) towards a wider settlement in exchange for sweeping protections against civil claims related to the addictive opioid. But the nation's top court ruled that granting such protections to the Sacklers, who did not themselves declare bankruptcy was not authorised under law. Sackler family members said they would continue to push for a settlement, warning that the alternative was \\\"costly and chaotic legal proceedings in courtrooms across the country\\\". The ruling is a victory for the US government and others who had challenged the deal, arguing that releasing the Sacklers was a misuse of the system. But it raises major questions about the future of the agreement, which had won significant, if mixed, support from many who sued the company and saw it as the only practical way to reach the family's billions for drug treatment and other uses. Ellen Isaacs, whose son Patrick Ryan Wroblewski died of an overdose in 2018 at the age of 33, was one of the family members who had opposed the shield for the Sacklers. She said she was not sure what came next, but was hopeful that justice would be done. \\\"I'd like to see them held fully accountable,\\\" she said. \\\"I'm just so grateful to the Supreme Court right now I can't get beyond that.\\\"\\n\\nReuters Oxycontin, often an entryway into harder drugs, such as heroin, has been blamed for driving the opioid crisis\\n\\nPurdue became a household name in the US as the maker and promoter of OxyContin - a prescription painkiller it promoted as safe, despite being aware it was both highly addictive and widely abused. The company declared bankruptcy in 2019, after it was hit by thousands of lawsuits brought by states, cities and families. It later pleaded guilty to criminal charges, including defrauding health agencies and making illegal payments to doctors. The kind of shield granted to the Sacklers in this deal has been a critical feature of other high-profile settlements, including those involving Boy Scouts of America and the Catholic Church. But courts have been divided as to whether such \\\"releases\\\" from liability for third parties like the Sacklers are actually permitted. In asking the Supreme Court to take up the issue, lawyers for the US government said letting it stand \\\"would leave in place a roadmap for wealthy corporations and individuals to misuse the bankruptcy system\\\" and escape accountability. Writing for the 5-4 majority, Justice Neil Gorsuch echoed those concerns. \\\"The Sacklers have not agreed to place anything approaching their full assets on the table for opioid victims, \\\" he wrote. \\\"Yet they seek a judicial order that would extinguish virtually all claims against them for fraud, willful injury, and even wrongful death, all without the consent of those who have brought and seek to bring such claims.\\\" The court noted that the Sacklers, who have long denied wrongdoing, \\\"seek to pay less than the code ordinarily requires and receive more than it normally permits\\\".\\n\\nOxycontin, often an entryway into harder drugs, such as heroin, has been blamed for driving the opioid crisis. Since 1999, a few years after the drug became available, deaths from opioid overdoses have surged eightfold to more than 80,000 annually. Court filings allege the Sackler family was long aware of the legal risks, and withdrew some $11bn from the company in the decade before its bankruptcy. They stashed much of the money overseas, while using some of it to pay company taxes, making recovery difficult. When the Supreme Court heard arguments last year, dozens of protesters opposing the deal showed up, holding signs such as \\\"my dead son does not release the Sacklers\\\". But many others had backed the deal, willing to accept the terms if the result was billions of dollars for treatment, as well as $750m that would go directly to opioid victims, estimated at $3,500-$48,000 each.\\n\\nGetty Images\",\n",

In 2022, the average worker spent 1,811 hours working through the year compared to 1,341 hours and 1,511 hours in Germany and France, respectively.\\n\\nCall it what you will, whether that\\u2019s ambition\\u2014or its lack thereof, as the Norwegian sovereign wealth fund CEO Nicolai Tangen said in April, it\\u2019s what distinguishes the workers\\u2019 attitudes.\\n\\n\\u201cParticularly in America, there\\u2019s an \\u2018ideal worker\\u2019 norm, and we feel pressure to look committed to the job at all times,\\u201d Dr. Mindy Shoss, a professor of psychology at the University of Central Florida, said to Expedia. The reason Americans cited for not taking enough time off was \\u201clife is too busy to plan or go on vacation,\\u201d the travel company\\u2019s 24th iteration of the \\u201cVacation Deprivation\\u201d report found.\\n\\nOn the contrary, vacations are seen as a \\u201cbasic right\\u201d in France, Christie Hudson, Expedia\\u2019s head of public relations, told Fortune last month. They\\u2019re also seen as a crucial aspect of overall well-being, which isn\\u2019t valid to the same extent in the U.S.\\n\\n\\u201cThe distinctly French emphasis on the fundamental right to rest is one to adopt everywhere,\\u201d the Expedia report said.\\n\\nWhat gives?\\n\\nFrance has become known as one of the least workaholic nations, with many people taking time off and working fewer hours.\\n\\nHowever, more generally, studies have found that European culture accommodates work-life balance more than the U.S. Countries like the U.K. have a statutory requirement entitling workers to 28 days off.\\n\\nThe approach is straightforward for Europeans: As long as people meet the subsistence level, they choose free time over wealth creation, unlike their American counterparts who prioritize the opposite, the Financial Times reported.\\n\\nEven when Americans choose to take vacations, rest and relaxation are often not a priority, making it harder to unplug. This explains the desire for more time off.\\n\\nIf we widen our gaze further, countries like Hong Kong and Japan offer unique lessons on how best to utilize the time workers get\\u2014whether that\\u2019s a little or a lot.\\n\\nHong Kong-based workers systematically plan their time off, often around public holidays, to maximize their vacations. That\\u2019s how they have no leftover days on average, and the same is true of Singapore.\\n\\nIn Japan, where workers get roughly 19 days off a year, seven days go unused, according to Expedia. Still, Japanese employees feel the least deprived of vacations. The trick? Taking short, but frequent breaks between work to make the most of time off.\\n\\n\\u201cIn Japan, people take time off every month instead of just twice a year. For the French, not even a full month of vacation feels like enough time,\\u201d Melanie Fish, Expedia brands public relations head said.\\n\\n\\u201cClearly there\\u2019s a lot for the U.S. to borrow from, whether it\\u2019s spreading your PTO throughout the year or prioritizing rest on your next vacation.\\u201d\",\n",

      "            \"body\": \"Energy prices fall but relief may be temporary\\n\\n12 hours ago By Kevin Peachey , Cost of living correspondent Share\\n\\nGetty Images\\n\\nA drop in domestic gas and electricity prices has now taken effect, but costs are expected to rise again in October. Regulator Ofgem's new price cap for England, Wales and Scotland came into force on Monday, meaning a typical household's energy bill will fall by \\u00a3122 a year. That brings down the bill for a household using a typical amount of gas and electricity to \\u00a31,568 a year, the lowest for two years. But forecasters expect it to rise again in the run-up to winter, more than reversing the latest drop.\\n\\nLeading consultancy Cornwall Insight predicts that a typical household's annual bill will be back up to \\u00a31,723 in October, a \\u00a3155, or 10%, increase from now. \\\"Modest falls in summer look set to be wiped out by bigger rises in autumn when people will need to put the heating back on,\\\" said Adam Scorer, chief executive of charity National Energy Action. \\\"The cost of energy remains an unaffordable luxury that many of the poorest simply cannot afford.\\\" Although the price cap is changed every three months, it is illustrated by Ofgem in terms of an annual bill for a household using a typical amount of gas and electricity. People in larger properties will tend to pay more overall owing to higher energy usage, and those in smaller properties will pay less.\\n\\nThat is because the cap, set by Ofgem, limits the maximum price that can be charged for each unit of gas and electricity - not the total bill. It affects the gas and electricity bills of 28 million households, but does not impact customers in Northern Ireland, where the sector is regulated differently but where prices are also falling.\\n\\nEnergy bills are considerably lower than the peak after Russia's invasion of Ukraine, when the government stepped in to limit bill rises. That has fed through to falls in the general rate of rising prices, known as inflation. However, a typical household's energy bill remains about \\u00a3400 higher than three years ago, prompting debate over the issue during the election campaign.\\n\\nIn addition, households have built up a collective debt to suppliers of about \\u00a33bn owing, primarily, to the pressure from high prices. Those on prepayment meters, who tend to top up meters during the colder, darker months and are often under more financial pressure, will see a less immediate impact of a drop in prices in the summer. The vast majority of households pay by direct debit, and their payments are smoothed out over the year. They should have been contacted by their supplier about the latest price changes. Experts say it is a good idea to take a meter reading now, to ensure billpayers are charged at the correct rate. Ofgem is reviewing the way the price cap is calculated, including sifting through a host of responses to a consultation on standing charges.\\n\\nLatest changes in detail\\n\\nThe new prices that took effect for July to the end of September mean: Gas prices are now capped at 5.48p per kilowatt hour (kWh), and electricity at 22.36p per kWh\\n\\nA typical household uses 2,700 kWh of electricity a year, and 11,500 kWh of gas\\n\\nHouseholds on pre-payment meters pay slightly less than those on direct debit, with a typical bill of \\u00a31,522\\n\\nThose who pay their bills every three months by cash or cheque pay more, with a typical bill of \\u00a31,668\\n\\nStanding charges - a fixed daily charge covering the costs of connecting to a supply - are unchanged at 60p a day for electricity and 31p a day for gas, although they vary by region\\n\\nHow to keep energy use - and bills - down\",\n",

      "            \"body\": \"Ask a millennial in the UK in 2024 what distinguishes them from their parents\\u2019 generation and it is likely that a single-word answer will crop up: housing.\\n\\nSince 2010, despite a succession of government pledges to would-be homeowners, the average age of a first-time buyer in the UK has risen. Meanwhile rents have soared, homelessness has more than doubled and housebuilding targets have been repeatedly missed.\\n\\nHere, as part of our wider series on how 14 years of Conservative party rule has changed Britain, we look at some of the key datasets around housing.\\n\\nThis article necessarily focuses on England because many housing matters are devolved to the Welsh, Scottish and Northern Irish governments.\\n\\nOwning a home has become harder Owning a home \\u201chas got harder\\u201d under the Conservatives. That\\u2019s not a quote from a Labour party attack advert \\u2013 but Rishi Sunak in a recent election interview with the BBC (he went on to say he would like to make it easier again). House price chart When David Cameron entered Downing Street two years after the 2008 house-price crash, the median house price in England stood at 6.9 times full-time employees\\u2019 median annual earnings: in 2023, it was 8.3 times. London in particular has become much more unaffordable since 2010: the median property price was 12.7 times the median Londoner\\u2019s earnings last September. It would be unfair to lay all of the blame for unaffordable housing at the door of the Tories \\u2013 it has been two decades since a mid-range-price house in England was less than five times median household income (a different metric from the full-time-earnings ratio mentioned above) and prices rose much faster than income under New Labour. But \\u2013 outside the 2008 housing bubble \\u2013 the middle-earning household could still afford to buy a house in the cheapest 20% of the market. That changed in 2021 when official data confirmed that the middle classes were being squeezed yet further, with only the cheapest 10% of houses now affordable to the middle-earning household.\\n\\nRenting a home is more expensive Both prime ministerial candidates have said they want a younger generation to experience the feeling of getting the keys to their first flat. But house prices aren\\u2019t the only blocker on home ownership because rents are increasingly eating into would-be-first-buyers\\u2019 ability to save for a deposit. Rental price chart The Office for National Statistics\\u2019 private rents index shows that renting in England is now 50% more expensive than 14 years ago, with the average rental price in London reaching a record level of \\u00a32,035 a month in February 2024. The cost of renting has increased across all the regions, but there are differences. While the rise in London and the south-west has gone above 50%, average prices in the north-east have gone up by 28%. This data covers all rents and not newly advertised properties, which means that for those newly renting or moving from one rented dwelling into another costs have probably risen by even more.\\n\\nNot enough houses are being built Part of the reason for rising unaffordability \\u2013 for buyers and renters \\u2013 is a lack of supply. Housing target chart Successive governments have missed their building targets: David Cameron did not keep his promise of providing 200,000 new \\u201cstarter homes\\u201d \\u2013 aimed at first-time buyers under the age of 40 \\u2013 in 2015. The National Audit Office said that, by the end of 2019, no such homes have been built. Theresa May made housing one of her main domestic priorities, most significantly in her 2018 party conference speech, when she announced measures designed to allow councils to borrow more to build up to an estimated 10,000 more homes a year; a welcomed, if modest target which, again, wasn\\u2019t met. Boris Johnson\\u2019s 2019 manifesto promised 300,000 new houses a year in England by the mid-2020s, although less than two years later, the then housing secretary Robert Jenrick admitted they would miss it by \\u201ca country mile\\u201d (the lastest figures show it\\u2019s 22% below target). And where local authorities once provided a sizeable amount of newbuilds \\u2013 which made up close to 40% of new builds in the 1970s, the private sector is now dominant. It has built more than 80% of new housing stock since 2019 with just 1% coming from local authorities (the balance comes from housing associations).\\n\\n\\u201cAffordable\\u201d rent has replaced social rent One of the early acts of the coalition government was the introduction of affordable rent \\u2013 a new type of way to rent a property from a housing association with a monthly cost higher than social rent but lower than the market rate. It was introduced in 2011 as part of the government\\u2019s austerity measures to help housing associations raise money after a huge cut to their funding. It has turned out to be affordable in name only in many parts of England and has all but killed off building for social rent. Affordable homes Social rents are calculated taking into account local earnings and property values, while affordable rents can be up to 80% of the going rate in the private rented sector, and are typically set at that level. In 2022/23 the median weekly social rent hit \\u00a389, the equivalent figure for affordable rents was \\u00a3134. That\\u2019s across England as a whole: in some parts of the country, affordable rents are double social rents, according to analysis by Inside Housing magazine. And since the new type of rented housing was launched, the number of homes being built for social rent has plummeted. While 39,562 homes for social rent were completed in 2022/23, the last year for which data is available, there were 9,561 new homes at that rent level, while 24,303 were created for the more expensive affordable rent.\",\n",

In December 2019 rent cost \\u00a31,064 a month on average according to the Office for National Statistics (ONS). By May 2024 this had risen by 22% to \\u00a31,301 for new and existing tenancies. Renters have told the BBC they have settled for mouldy properties, sofa-surfed or moved back in with relatives. The National Residential Landlords Association blamed a \\u201cchronic shortage\\u201d of private rental homes on high interest rates prompting landlords to leave the market. Hundreds of people have been in touch with the BBC about rent via Your Voice, Your Vote.\\n\\n'All of us have been homeless'\\n\\nDelia-Ioana, a 24-year-old freelance production assistant, pays \\u00a3567 per month for a flat share in Bristol. She said it took eight months for a dripping tap to be fixed, impacting her water bills, and the walls were mouldy and damp with mineral deposits. Delia-Ioana plans to move out soon, but said rent was often too expensive, and she worried about the future. \\u201cI was looking at my friends \\u2013 all of us have been homeless at some point. A floor here, a sofa there,\\u201d she said. \\u201cHow are we going to afford to have children if we can\\u2019t afford a house?\\u201d Average rents in Bristol rose 34% between December 2019 and May 2024, from \\u00a31,312 to \\u00a31,759 per month, the eighth largest increase among local authorities in England.\\n\\nDelia Ioana/BBC Delia-Ioana said every room in her flat share has mould in\\n\\nHow has rent changed in your area?\\n\\nWhy has rent been increasing?\\n\\nBetween December 2019 and May 2024, average private rent in England rose by 22% according to the Office for National Statistics (ONS). It used a \\\"geometric average\\\" to account for differences in property types and changes in the rental markets. Across a similar period (April 2019 to April 2024) the Institute for Fiscal Studies estimated UK earnings rose by 4-6% in real terms. The Bank of England started raising interest rates in December 2021, pushing mortgages up. It has kept them at 5.25% since last summer, aiming to slow the pace of rising prices. Richard Donnell, property company Zoopla\\u2019s executive head of research, said these increases have made it harder for potential first-time buyers. According to Mr Donnell there are fewer private landlords, meaning the total number of rental homes in the UK has barely changed since 2016 - but demand has continued to soar. \\u201cThe big increase in demand happened after the pandemic ended and the economy reopened,\\\" he said. \\\"You had this big return of people to cities, the international borders reopened.\\u201d He said the growth of working from home has made cheaper areas outside big cities more appealing.\\n\\nWhere has rent increased the most?\\n\\nLondon has the highest average rent in England. But Tameside in Greater Manchester saw the largest percentage increase, up by more than 40% - from \\u00a3555 in December 2019, to \\u00a3780 in May 2024. Six Greater Manchester local authorities were among the areas with the biggest percentage rises in England.\\n\\n'It was like a bidding war'\\n\\nLuisa, a civil servant renting in Tameside, lived with her two adult children in a three-bedroom house for \\u00a3695 per month in 2022. On 25 September that year, her landlord sent her a letter saying he was selling the property. He cited government decisions, interest rate increases, rising insurances and legislation he said unfairly tackled landlords. Two days earlier, then Prime Minister Liz Truss\\u2019s chancellor Kwasi Kwarteng shared a \\u2018mini budget\\u2019 intended to stimulate economic growth.

      "            \"title\": \"FedEx Q4: Turnaround Taking Hold (NYSE:FDX)\",\n",
      "            \"body\": \"Wirestock/iStock Editorial via Getty Images\\n\\nInvestment Thesis\\n\\nI believe the ongoing struggles FedEx (NYSE:FDX) has faced are mainly centered around their competitive operating efficiency, as exemplified by the U.S. Postal Service's decision to expand United Parcel Service (UPS) as their primary air cargo provider in April 2024.\\n\\nFor years, FedEx has faced challenges in sustaining their operations, especially in securing mutually beneficial terms to extend their contract with USPS. USPS was FedEx Express\\u2019s largest customer, paying them roughly $1.7 billion in the fiscal year of 2023. This was a big loss to FedEx. However, I think the turnaround is starting to take shape.\\n\\nFedEx has begun introducing cost-cutting measures under their DRIVE savings program, which contributed to a 14% increase in net income for the fiscal Q3 ending February 2024. So far, these cost cutting measures have proven to be successful in not only reducing costs but also making them more lean and efficient, as revenue has increased from $21.7 billion last quarter to $22.1 billion beating expectations by $41.14 million.\\n\\nAssuming this turnaround has legs, I think the stock has upside. With this, I am a strong buy on shares. If FedEx can continue to execute their cost-cutting strategies effectively and stabilize their revenue streams, the current valuation presents a compelling entry point for investors looking for potential upside in a market where FedEx has historically been undervalued relative to their performance improvements\\u200b.\\n\\nBackground\\u200b\\u200b\\n\\nFedEx has faced significant operational inefficiencies that have contributed to their lagging performance compared to competitors like UPS. These inefficiencies stem from various structural and strategic challenges, such as the underperformance of FedEx's Express segment. For the fiscal year ending May 31, 2024, the Express unit's operating margin stood at a meager 1.9%, lower than the 20% margin achieved by the Freight unit and the 13% margin of the Ground segment\\u200b\\u200b.\\n\\nAnother factor is the declining revenue across key segments. For the previous fiscal Q3 of 2024, the company reported a 2% year-over-year decline in total revenue, dropping from $22.2 billion to $21.7 billion\\u200b\\u200b. The Express segment alone saw a 2% decrease in revenue due to lower volumes and fewer fees for fuel and surcharges. However, as I mentioned above, revenue has begun to turn around for FedEx in this most recent quarter.\\n\\nThe loss of their contract with the USPS to UPS\\u200b\\u200b, which accounted for roughly $1.7 billion in revenue, reflects their operational inefficiencies and inability to sustain their customer relations. USPS needed an option to lower their costs and a longer reach with more areas where FedEx has evidently been underperforming\\u200b\\u200b\\u200b\\u200b. The new contract with UPS is described as \\\"mutually beneficial\\\" and complements their \\\"unique, reliable and efficient integrated network,\\\" according to UPS CEO Carol Tom\\u00e9\\u200b\\u200b.\\n\\nFedEx, for their part, announced in a post:\\n\\nThe elimination of structural costs currently in place to support postal service volume will be addressed and, in conjunction with our DRIVE efforts, FedEx profitability will improve in FY25 and beyond.\\n\\nEarnings Recap\\n\\nFedEx's recent earnings report has delivered results that exceeded market expectations, leading to a significant boost in their stock price. FedEx reported a non-GAAP earnings per share (EPS) of $5.41, which beat analyst estimates by $0.04. The company also boasted a revenue of $22.1 billion, which surpassed expectations by $40 million\\u200b\\u200b. Importantly, this performance marks a year-over-year revenue increase of 0.9%.\\n\\nThe company's operating income for 4Q was $1.87 billion on an adjusted basis, beating the consensus estimate of $1.82 billion. Not only did FedEx beat expectations but this is also an increase from $1.77 billion a year ago. This improvement in operating income was driven by decreased structural costs from FedEx's DRIVE initiatives, increased yield, and reduced self-insurance costs\\u200b\\u200b. The Ground segment, in particular, showed better performance because of growth in commercial volume and effective cost management.\\n\\nFedEx also announced plans to repurchase $2.5 billion of their common stock, including $1.0 billion during the first fiscal quarter. They also approved an increase in the annual dividend rate by 10% to $5.52 per share\\u200b\\u200b. Since reporting earnings on June 25th, FedEx shares have increased by nearly 17%.\\n\\nAll of this sounds good. I believe this shows a company pulling off a multi-prong turnaround in both revenue, operating income, and delivering more capital back to shareholders. It appears to be a triple win.\\n\\nChief Customer Officer, Brie Carere, is optimistic for the coming year. During the company\\u2019s recent earnings call, she stated:\\n\\nLooking ahead, in fiscal year 2025, we expect the demand environment to moderately improve as we move through the year. Currently, we expect US domestic parcel and LTL volumes to continue to improve with the year-over-year increase growing as the year progresses. International air cargo demand from Asia accelerated in early May and is stronger versus previous expectations. We expect year-over-year growth to be driven by e-commerce and low inventory levels. Shippers are facing tightened capacity both in air and sea freight services. Red Sea disruptions have further exacerbated shipper challenges from Asia to Europe. These conditions should bring strength to the overall air freight yields from Asia. -Q4 Call.\\n\\nWhile FedEx has been struggling, their future looks much better.\\n\\nValuation\\n\\nOver the past three months, FedEx has recorded only 4 upward EPS revisions and 19 downward revenue revisions, which indicate market analysts' pretty bearish outlook for the company\\u2019s earnings power\\u200b\\u200b. This conservative position has resulted in forward estimates that may understate the company's performance.\\n\\nWith these conservative revisions, FedEx's valuation metrics suggest the stock is undervalued relative to their sector. The company\\u2019s forward Non-GAAP P/E ratio stands at 14.44, compared to the sector median of 18.65, representing a -22.60% discount\\u200b\\u200b. This discrepancy indicates that even with muted EPS estimates, there is still room for growth.\\n\\nThe company's EPS growth rate (FWD) is projected to be 17.42%\\u200b\\u200b, and is expected to compound at 13.90% over the next 3-5 year CAGR horizon. I like this a lot (on top of the share buybacks the company is committing to).\\n\\nIf FedEx's valuation were to converge with the sector median forward P/E, this would imply a significant upside potential. Given the current forward P/E of 14.44 and the sector median of 18.65, the stock could see an upside of approximately 29.16% if revalued at the sector median\\u200b\\u200b. The company\\u2019s forward EPS growth on both the short and medium term horizons is projected to beat the sector median. This is after analysts downgraded estimates for more conservative growth. I think this is a great setup.\\n\\nRisks\\n\\nEconomic indicators point to decreased growth in the demand for U.S. freight, further exacerbating the industry's challenges. Factors such as a capacity glut in U.S. highways, driven by an increase in registered Class 8 vehicles from 1.47 million in February 2020 to 1.7 million by April 2023, have diluted the impact of any gains in freight demand. This oversupply has softened the market and weakened freight rates, creating a tough environment for logistics companies\\u200b\\u200b including FedEx.\\n\\nThe National Truckload Index, which measures average national truckload spot rates, fell to $1.49 per mile last year, while operating costs for trucking companies had risen by over 30 cents per mile, not including fuel costs\\u200b\\u200b (as of June 24th, spot rates have gone up to $2.32 for a seven-day average).\\n\\nFedEx has not been immune to these industry-wide issues, which have weighed heavily on their earlier financial results. The company's freight segment has struggled to maintain profitability amid declining volumes and lower rates. The broader economic context, marked by slow manufacturing growth and fluctuating retail sales, has also played a role in the sluggish performance of the freight market\\u200b\\u200b. The Transportation Services Index (TSI) data reflects this, showing that freight transportation services have not regained their pre-recession growth rates and continue to lag behind the overall economy's growth\\u200b\\u200b.\\n\\nFedEx has also been affected by the growing dominance of Amazon in the delivery market, whose expansion in logistics has increased competition and shifted significant volumes away from traditional carriers like FedEx. In 2023, Amazon was estimated to have delivered 5.9 billion packages, surpassing both UPS and FedEx\\u200b\\u200b\\u200b\\u200b.\\n\\nThere are also other factors that can hinder any prospect for the company\\u2019s performance.\\n\\nIn 2023, there were wage disparity and labor issues within FedEx Ground. Former contractors have cited a 30% to 40% turnover among drivers in the past 18 months. This problem was exacerbated by the wage differences compared to UPS drivers, who, under a new Teamsters union contract, could earn higher wages and benefits. This made it challenging for FedEx to attract and retain qualified drivers.\\n\\nHowever, these risks can be managed, in my opinion.\\n\\nAs the logistics industry consolidates, FedEx stands to benefit by streamlining their operations and leveraging their expansive network more effectively. This phase is expected to reduce competitive fragmentation, and allow FedEx to capitalize on their scale and scope. In recent years, FedEx has launched several initiatives to enhance their operational efficiency and reduce costs. For instance, the expansion of the Mojix inventory tracking platform enables FedEx to reduce aircraft downtime by swiftly locating and delivering necessary parts for repairs, thereby maintaining operational agility and minimizing costs\\u200b\\u200b.\\n\\nFedEx has also been focusing on their advanced data capabilities to drive efficiency and innovation. The establishment of the FedEx Innovation Lab in 2023 aims to leverage advanced technology and data-driven insights and build smart logistics solutions and digital capabilities.\\n\\nFedEx Dataworks, another project, combines the company's digital and physical networks to create a scalable platform of interconnected data, insights, and information. This platform captures real-time data on every package, enhancing supply chain visibility and predictability by integrating advanced analytics, AI, and machine learning.\\n\\nThese are the types of things only logistics providers at scale can do, which means they are highly competitive not only against other large logistics providers, but also against small ones as well. It's why I am optimistic the company can thrive in this environment. It's why I feel optimistic that a turnaround has begun.\\n\\nBottom Line\\n\\nFedEx has faced numerous challenges in recent years, including operational inefficiencies, a competitive freight market, and the growing dominance of Amazon in the delivery sector. However, the company has taken steps to address these issues for a potential turnaround. The introduction of the DRIVE cost-cutting initiative aims to save $4 billion by 2025 $6 billion by 2027. FedEx has also invested in advanced technology and data analytics to drive efficiency and innovation\\u200b\\u200b\\u200b\\u200b.\\n\\nThe recent earnings report reflects these efforts starting to bear fruit\\u200b\\u200b. The favorable guidance for fiscal 2025, combined with plans for significant stock repurchases and dividend increases, further boosts my confidence\\u200b\\u200b. Despite previous downward revisions, the company\\u2019s forward P/E ratio remains below the sector median, which suggests substantial upside potential as turnaround (I believe) occurs. With this, I place FedEx as a strong buy.\",\n",

Paul Cassell, who says he got the information \\\"directly from the Justice Department\\\", added that the deal includes a small fine, three years of probation and independent safety audits. Boeing did not immediately reply to the BBC's request for comment, while the Justice Department (DoJ) declined to provide a statement. It comes as Boeing announced it had reached a deal to buy the aerospace supplier Spirit AeroSystems - a move it said would improve quality and safety. Spirit made the fuselage that suffered a mid-flight blowout on an Alaska Airlines 737 Max 9 jet in January, sparking widespread concern about standards at Boeing.\\n\\n'Families will object to this deal'\\n\\nLast month, US prosecutors recommended that the DoJ bring criminal charges against the plane maker. That was after the DoJ said Boeing had violated a 2021 settlement related to the crashes which killed 346 people. \\\"The memory of 346 innocents killed by Boeing demands more justice than this,\\\" said Mr Cassell, adding that the \\\"families will strenuously object to this plea deal\\\". The plane crashes - both involving Boeing's 737 Max aircraft - occurred within six months of each other. The crash involving Indonesia's Lion Air occurred in October 2018, followed by an Ethiopian Airlines flight in March 2019. Both crashes were linked to faulty flight control systems. A letter sent last month by Mr Cassell to the DoJ revealed that the families had been seeking prosecutions of Boeing's top executives at the time of the crashes and a fine of $24.8bn (\\u00a319.6bn) for \\\"the deadliest corporate crime in US history\\\". The Justice Department has until 7 July to decide whether to revive a criminal charge of fraud brought against Boeing in 2021. That charge has lain dormant since the company acknowledged in a settlement that it had misled air-safety regulators about aspects of the 737 Max, and promised to create a new compliance system to detect and prevent further fraud. Under the deal reached in 2021, Boeing said it would pay a $2.5bn settlement and prosecutors agreed to ask the court to drop a criminal charge after three years if the company abided by certain stipulations set out in the deferred prosecution agreement. But in May, the DoJ said Boeing was in breach of the deal, stating that it had failed to \\\"design, implement, and enforce a compliance and ethics program to prevent and detect violations of the US fraud laws throughout its operations\\\".\",\n",

      "            \"body\": \"\\u201cIn this city, everyone feels the decline of the North Sea,\\u201d says Chris Douglas, 39, who has lived in Aberdeen his whole life and began working as a taxi driver in the Granite City 20 years ago. He now has his own cab company, which in the past was entirely reliant on bookings from the oil and gas industry \\u2013 today it\\u2019s \\u201cmaybe 50%\\u201d, he says.\\n\\n\\u201cYou only have to look around: there are industrial estates decimated, hotels no longer trading. The good days are long gone,\\u201d he says. \\u201cAnd no political party is coming along to say they are going to rejuvenate the industry. There are just different plans for how to close it down.\\u201d\\n\\nThe oil and gas fields in the North Sea are in terminal decline. Last year, the oil basin produced 34m tonnes of oil, its lowest since production in the North Sea was established in the 1970s. As its accessible fossil fuels dwindle, big oil companies have pulled out of the ageing oil basin. And despite the government issuing a rush of licences since Russia\\u2019s invasion of Ukraine, the amount of oil set to be extracted is rapidly shrinking.\\n\\nMeanwhile, the climate crisis \\u2013 fuelled by gas, oil and coal extraction \\u2013 is accelerating at a frightening speed and the world\\u2019s leading scientists and energy analysts are clear: there can be no new oil and gas projects if humanity is to avoid catastrophe.\\n\\nView image in fullscreen Union Street in Aberdeen\\u2019s city centre. The city prospered from North Sea oil. Photograph: Andreea Dragomir/Alamy\\n\\nIn the far north-east of Scotland, this combination of factors could spell disaster for the almost 60,000 workers supported by the oil and gas industry, their families and communities. For the past four decades they have prospered on the well-paid, secure jobs North Sea oil has provided. But now they are looking into an abyss.\\n\\n\\u201cMost of my friends went into the North Sea industry because for them, and for their fathers and their grandfathers, it has always been seen as a sure thing. Does the green economy offer that same security, the same pay?\\u201d Douglas says.\\n\\nThis is a crucial moment for these communities, according to Joe Rollin, a senior organiser at the union Unite, which represents tens of thousands of oil and gas workers. \\u201cWe simply can\\u2019t let these workers be the coalminers of this generation, with all the devastation to lives and communities that would entail,\\u201d he says.\\n\\nThis is the challenge facing politicians in Westminster and Holyrood before this week\\u2019s general election. How do they manage the inevitable and urgent decline of North Sea oil and gas \\u2013 and can they ensure a just transition to new low-carbon jobs that are fully unionised, well-paid and secure?\\n\\nFor Mika Minio-Paluello, a policy officer at the Trades Union Congress (TUC), there is a lot on the line.\\n\\n\\u201cWhatever happens to the people working in North Sea oil and gas, it is being closely watched by those in different industries and sectors \\u2013 not just across the UK but also in other countries \\u2013 to see if we can take working people on this journey.\\n\\n\\u201cIt is a test case in some ways, for the whole idea of a just transition, of what happens when we decarbonise \\u2026 we simply can\\u2019t have a repeat of what happened to coal workers in the 80s.\\u201d\\n\\nView image in fullscreen The end of the miners\\u2019 strike at Selby coalfield in Yorkshire in 1985. Many communities were decimated by pit closures under the Thatcher government. Photograph: World Image Archive/Alamy\\n\\nThe spectre of the miners\\u2019 plight after the pit closures in the 1980s hangs over this debate. The communities that were decimated when the then Conservative prime minister Margaret Thatcher closed the pits and smashed the coalminers\\u2019 union never recovered.\\n\\nArguably the stakes now are even higher. The escalating climate crisis demands a rapid end to fossil fuel production, but the populist right across Europe is on the rise and it has climate action in their sights \\u2013 describing it as a remote, elite project being done at the expense of ordinary workers.\\n\\nThe UK\\u2019s main political parties are divided on the issue. The Conservative party is still promising to \\u201cmax out\\u201d oil and gas in the North Sea by granting licences for new exploration every year. Meanwhile, Labour has promised to put an end to new licences, and raise taxes on the large profits being made by companies operating in the North Sea. The party is also promising \\u201cnot a single job\\u201d will be lost during the transition.\\n\\nIn response, the Scottish National party has U-turned on its pledge to phase out fossil fuel licences and is trying to tread a \\u201cmiddle ground\\u201d, saying it will approve licences if they meet strict climate conditions \\u2013 although most experts struggle to see how this could be possible.\\n\\nNigel Farage, the leader of the insurgent populist Reform UK party, is waiting to capitalise, vowing at his manifesto launch last month to axe net zero policies and fast-track licences to open up the North Sea.\\n\\n\\u201cIf we fail to do this transition in a way that takes communities with us, then we leave the way open for Farage and the far right,\\u201d said Minio-Paluello. \\u201cThe risk of the far right culture wars building a wave of support on the back of our failure is very, very real.\\u201d\\n\\nThere is little doubt the writing is on the wall for the industry. Experts point out that the number of jobs supported directly and indirectly by oil and gas has more than halved in the past decade \\u2013 from 441,000 to 214,00 \\u2013 during which time the government has issued roughly 400 new licences in six licensing rounds.\\n\\nAccording to the former head of the oil and gas regulator, new licences would make a difference to gas production only \\u201caround the edges\\u201d. Even BP\\u2019s former chief executive has said North Sea drilling is \\u201cnot going to make any difference\\u201d to Britain\\u2019s energy security.\\n\\nAjay Parmar, a director at ICIS, a commodity data provider, says:\\u201cThe UK\\u2019s oil supply decline has been in the works for decades. Labour\\u2019s policy will hasten the decline but only marginally.\\u201d\\n\\nView image in fullscreen Climate activists protesting against drilling in the North Sea. Photograph: Graeme Robertson/The Guardian\\n\\nCritics of the Tory pitch to \\u201cmax out\\u201d North Sea oil claim it is part of a culture war framing what will only result in workers being stranded in a declining industry with no plan to save their livelihoods or communities.\\n\\nAnalysts and trade unions agree that unless it is managed properly, the transition will have a devastating impact on the Scottish economy. According to a report by the consultancy EY, which was commissioned by the Scottish government, North Sea workers have an annual average salary of \\u00a388,000, while those working in the oil and gas supply chain earn an average of \\u00a351,000 a year. This is well above the average annual salary of \\u00a329,000 in Scotland \\u2013 and above the \\u00a342,600 average wage of employees in the clean energy sector, according to figures from the Energy and Climate Intelligence Unit.\\n\\nAs high-wage oil jobs are replaced with clean energy roles, the gross value of Scotland\\u2019s employment sector could plummet from \\u00a319bn a year in 2019 to \\u00a312bn by 2050, according to the report.\\n\\nFor people like Dale Green, who has been working on the rigs for the past 22 years, those statistics could be life-changing.\\n\\n\\u201cWhen I was growing up, the only option for me really if I wanted a good job, good money, was to work on the rigs,\\u201d says the 39-year-old scaffolder. \\u201cIt has allowed me to move on from the council estate where I grew up and to be able to afford a decent life \\u2013 to look after my children, get a house, get a car.\\u201d\\n\\nDale fears that unless the transition is properly managed the chances he has had will be denied to future generations.\\n\\n\\u201cTaking away opportunities that someone like me has enjoyed, a scaffolder from a working-class community who grew up on a council estate, it could just decimate certain areas,\\u201d said Green.\\n\\nIf it wins the election, Labour plans to set up a taskforce with Scottish Labour, the big energy companies and the unions to \\u201csecure a future for every oil and gas worker\\u201d. It says the new jobs will mostly be in renewables, carbon capture and storage, and hydrogen.\\n\\nView image in fullscreen Wind turbines at the Seagreen offshore windfarm, under construction off the coast of Montrose in the North Sea.

They argue a well-funded, pro-active industrial strategy will be required to create the jobs in wind turbine manufacturing, installation and maintenance, as well as in the wider supply chain for renewables.\\n\\nUnite says much more needs to be done. Its general secretary, Sharon Graham, refused to sign off the party\\u2019s manifesto at its \\u201cclause V\\u201d last month \\u2013 in part because of fears Labour\\u2019s plans for oil and gas workers in the North Sea were too vague.\\n\\n\\u201cWe should not be letting go of one rope until we have hold of another,\\u201d Graham said earlier this year. \\u201cThese types of transitions must have workers at the heart. Unite will not stand by and let these workers be thrown on the scrap heap.\\u201d\\n\\nThe union is running a grassroots \\u201cNo ban without a plan\\u201d campaign across north-east Scotland, urging Labour to outline more detailed and funded proposals before banning new licences. Last week, more than 200 small businesses published a letter backing the campaign and calling on Labour to spell out exactly where the jobs will come from.\\n\\nPreviously, this position might have seen trade unions pitted against climate groups calling for a rapid winding down of the industry. However, behind the scenes there has been an unlikely alliance emerging.\\n\\nLast week, 60 leading climate organisations including Greenpeace UK, Friends of the Earth England, Wales and Northern Ireland, Oxfam UK and Extinction Rebellion signed an open letter calling for a \\u201cclear and funded\\u201d transition plan for workers and communities reliant on the oil and gas industry.\\n\\nThe letter, which was sent to all party leaders, is based on a report created in consultation with workers and backed by Unite, the National Union of Rail, Maritime and Transport Workers (RMT), the Public and Commercial Services Union (PCS), and Unison Scotland.\\n\\nA spokesperson for Unite says the union welcomed \\u201csupport from the climate movement\\u201d.\\n\\n\\u201cWe are fully behind a transition to greener energy, but this must be a fair transition, one that has workers and communities at its heart \\u2026 we will continue to work with climate groups who are calling for ambitious government action on a just transition.\\u201d\\n\\nRuby Earle, from the campaign group Platform, which helped coordinate the letter, says it shows \\u201chow far the climate movement and unions have come in building relationships\\u201d.\\n\\n\\u201cGovernment support for a just transition cannot be an afterthought. A clear and funded industrial strategy, alongside publicly owned energy, is not only essential for workers, communities, and the millions of people living in fuel poverty, but also to ensure the transition happens within climate limits.\\u201d\\n\\nJake Molloy, a former oil and gas worker and trade unionist for almost 20 years, who now sits on the Scottish government\\u2019s Just Transition Commission, is at the sharp end of this emerging coalition.\\n\\n\\u201cIf I had suggested, 20 years ago [to his colleagues in the industry] that they go and meet Greenpeace or another climate group, they would have thought I meant for a fight because these groups were seen as wanting to destroy our jobs, our communities.\\u201d\\n\\nBut he says that has changed in recent years, with a huge amount of work going on behind the scenes. Molloy says this has resulted in more climate groups recognising that the necessary transition away from fossil fuels cannot be done at the expense of ordinary working people. At the same time, some unions and workers have accepted that the transition is necessary and \\u2013 if done correctly \\u2013 positive.\\n\\n\\u201cMore and more people on both sides are realising that this is an industrial revolution on an unprecedented scale and that we need change \\u2013 change so fundamental as to strip away the ideology that we\\u2019ve worked in for the last 40 years.\\u201d\\n\\nMolloy warns that many of the much-heralded \\u201cnew jobs\\u201d in renewables do not exist in Scotland \\u2013 citing a recent windfarm development that has been built, installed and maintained entirely by overseas companies and governments.\\n\\nTessa Khan, the director of campaign group Uplift, says the next government needs to \\u201cget everyone around the table \\u2013 the Scottish government, trade unions, worker representatives and affected communities \\u2013 to come up with a coherent plan that works in everyone\\u2019s interests\\u201d.\\n\\nCrucially, she says, the transition plans must be taken out of the hands of the oil and gas industry.\\n\\n\\u201cThe majority of operators in the basin invest nothing in UK renewable energy, but nor are they investing in UK oil and gas production. The record profits of recent years have gone to their shareholders, not to investment in the transition. [They] aren\\u2019t interested in creating clean jobs and growing the UK economy but in making as much money as they can for themselves, for as long they can get away with it.\\u201d\\n\\nLast month the supreme court in London ruled the climate impact of burning oil and gas must be taken into account when deciding whether to approve projects.\\n\\nExperts say this is likely to be another nail in the coffin of North Sea oil and gas, making it it harder to secure new licences. It could even threaten some of those that have been approved, including the controversial Rosebank oil and gas field, to be operated by the Norwegian company Equinor.\\n\\nA Labour source said if the party did form the next government, and Rosebank was still in the balance, then ministers could refuse the remaining consents it needed to operate.\\n\\nMolloy, who has spent years working on a just transition for his colleagues in the industry, says whatever the result in the election it is essential that politicians and corporations are not able to pit those worried about the climate crisis against those who want to ensure a decent future for workers, their families and communities.\\n\\n\\u201cI\\u2018ve got four grandsons who will never forgive me if I get this wrong, and I\\u2019ve been trying for considerable time to get it right, because their future \\u2013 and that of millions around the world \\u2013 relies on us getting this right.\\u201d\",\n",

      "            \"body\": \"Would new licences save the North Sea oil and gas industry?\\n\\n4 days ago By Kevin Keane , BBC Scotland environment correspondent Share\\n\\nPA Media Surfers in Aberdeen stage a protest on the beach calling for an end to new oil and gas licensing\\n\\n\\\"Do you support new oil and gas licences, yes or no?\\\" That's the binary question which has been at the centre of the political debate in Scotland since parties began preparing to fight the general election. Political leaders have been hurling accusations that 100,000 jobs in Scotland will be at risk if no more licences are issued. But that figure is 40,000 more than the total number of people in Scotland whose roles currently rely directly or indirectly on fossil fuel extraction. And analysis by BBC Scotland News suggests that new licences will only extend the life of the North Sea by up to five years at today's production levels. The North Sea Transition Authority (NSTA) - which issues licences - estimates that about two billion barrels of \\\"unlicenced\\\" oil remains. Last year the industry produced 440 million barrels.\\n\\nEnvironmentalists have been campaigning for governments to stop issuing exploration licences which allow oil companies to search for new discoveries of fossil fuels. The industry says without new oil finds, the rate at which the sector declines will accelerate - putting jobs at risk. It is now 25 years since production peaked in the North Sea. In 1999, the equivalent of about 1.7 billion barrels of oil and gas was pumped ashore. Output had dropped to 884 million barrels by 2010, then plummeted further to 552 million in 2022, a fall of about 67% on peak levels. Government predictions suggest output will halve again by 2030 to 251 million barrels and fall as low as 58 million by 2050 - which is just 3% of peak production. That's because when the oil boom came we targeted the biggest reserves first which were easiest to exploit.\\n\\nNowadays, operators are focused on the remaining smaller wells and using much more advanced - and expensive - techniques to extract it. While the North Sea Transition Authority estimates that the UK has around 10 to 15 billion barrels of oil and gas remaining, only about two billion are in areas where the UK government has so far not issued licences for operators to explore. The suggestion that 100,000 North Sea jobs could be at risk without new exploration licences came from Aberdeen and Grampian Chamber of Commerce. Using data from the investment banking firm Stifel, it produced a report last month saying the next Westminster government had \\\"just 100 days to save 100,000 jobs\\\" in the industry across the UK. During the general election campaign the Conservatives and SNP have repeatedly asserted that by promising to end exploration licences, their opponents risk 100,000 Scottish jobs.\\n\\nRenewables industries like offshore wind are expected to ramp up this decade\\n\\nThe Conservatives fully support continued licences while the SNP say applications should be considered on a case-by-case basis. Labour has said it will issue no more licences and the Liberal Democrats believe the focus should be on creating more jobs in renewable energy like wind power. The Scottish Greens would go furthest of all, by rescinding recently issued licences including 54 which were granted in October and January. Offshore Energies UK estimates that there are now only 60,700 people in Scotland who work directly or indirectly in oil and gas. That number rises to 120,000 across the UK as a whole. Research by Robert Gordon University (RGU) estimates that in the worst case scenario the number of oil and gas jobs lost in the UK by 2030 could reach 60,000. It predicts that even on a best case scenario, with new licenses continuing and investment returning, some 33,000 jobs will still go as a result of falling oil and gas production. So by their estimate, the actual number of jobs \\\"at risk\\\" is 27,000 across the whole UK, not just Scotland.\\n\\nJob forecasts\",\n",

      "            \"body\": \"What we learned from IT expert at Post Office inquiry\\n\\n3 days ago Share\\n\\nBBC\\n\\nThe computer expert who helped build the faulty Horizon software has finally spoken under oath about his involvement in the Post Office scandal. Gareth Jenkins is a key figure, having appeared as an expert witness to defend Horizon in court cases, and is now at the centre of an alleged cover-up. His appearance at the inquiry was long-awaited after being postponed twice. He gave evidence over four days - the longest run of questions any witness has faced - and gave his version of events. Here are five key moments from his evidence.\\n\\n1. He thought Horizon bugs were fixed quickly\\n\\nGareth Jenkins referred to Horizon's overall reliability throughout his testimony, even challenging findings from the landmark Bates v Post Office case that identified issues with the IT system. He acknowledged \\\"individual problems\\\" affecting specific branches but asserted that, as a whole, the system was \\\"working well\\\". When questioned about bugs, Mr Jenkins admitted lacking personal knowledge of all known issues, stating he typically became involved when drafted in for problem resolution. When pressed on how he could provide court evidence without full oversight of existing problems, Mr Jenkins said: \\\"Bugs impacting accounts were rare. Monitoring was in place, and fixes were prompt. Therefore, live system problems were rare, making me confident in its operation.\\\" He claimed nobody from the Post Office alerted him to unknown issues, and he didn't actively seek information about bugs he wasn't involved in fixing. Mr Jenkins admitted not realising the need for comprehensive knowledge when giving evidence and \\\"with hindsight would have done things differently\\\".\\n\\n2. He was sent expert witness rules\\n\\nMr Jenkins was an \\u201cexpert witness\\u201d in several prosecutions brought by the Post Office. His duty was to the courts, not the Post Office or his employer Fujitsu. His role meant disclosing any relevant information about the Horizon software \\u2013 even evidence that could help sub-postmasters' cases. Lawyers should have ensured that Mr Jenkins understood this. When asked about this by Mr Beer, Mr Jenkins stated that he didn\\u2019t know about his responsibilities until the end of 2020. But Mr Beer showed him a letter from November 2005, written by lawyers working for the Post Office. The letter mentioned that he was an expert witness and, according to Mr Beer, listed his duties in an \\u201ceasy-to-understand way\\u201d. After initially denying he had received it, Mr Jenkins later accepted that it was sent to him. He said he had \\u201cno recollection of having been briefed\\u201d on his duties and had \\u201cclearly forgotten\\u201d about having seen the letter.\\n\\n3. He knew remote access was possible\\n\\nThe former \\\"distinguished engineer\\\" faced intense questioning regarding remote access \\u2013 the ability of Fujitsu staff to modify sub-postmaster branch accounts without their knowledge. In his 2010 witness statement for Seema Misra's trial, he stated: \\\"No external systems can manipulate branch accounts without user awareness and authorisation.\\\" During the inquiry, Mr Jenkins accepted knowing that remote access was possible but believed it happened infrequently and left a visible trail. He based this view on \\\"informal chats\\\" with other Fujitsu IT staff. The former engineer told the inquiry that he only discovered the extent of unrestricted access Fujitsu technical staff had to sub-postmaster accounts during the 2018 High Court battle.\\n\\n4. He was a 'willing actor' for the Post Office\\n\\nIn 2005, Mr Jenkins was asked to provide a draft witness statement in the case of sub-postmaster Noel Thomas. The Post Office wanted his thoughts on how the losses could have occurred. One possibility, he said, was some sort of system failure. But the Post Office demanded changes, saying the line was potentially \\u201cvery damaging\\\". It got deleted. The inquiry heard he was a \\u201cwilling actor\\u201d in this process. He said he was happy with the changes he ended up with as it still accurately reflected what had happened but used \\u201cless emotive words\\\". The Post Office was applying the pressure, but he never checked with his own Fujitsu lawyers about signing off evidence that had been toned down. Earlier he was asked to explain attempts to \\u201ctweak\\u201d his statements, but Mr Jenkins believed this was more of a \\u201ctidying up\\u201d to make them easier to read. He said he pushed back when the changes went too far.\\n\\n5. He was 'better with systems than people'\\n\\nFour days of forensic questioning meant plenty of room for big revelations. It also meant Gareth Jenkins had nowhere to hide. It was very revealing about the character of the man who has been mentioned so many times at this inquiry. An IT specialist who spent his entire career at one company, by his own admission, he dealt \\u201cbetter with systems than people\\u201d. He would have been happiest engineering and designing, but found himself entangled in something very different. Something, he argues, he didn't fully understand. \\\"Can't you use the report I have already sent you?\\\" Mr Jenkins wrote to a Post Office lawyer in 2012. It is clear he was viewing the growing number of legal queries as a confusing frustration, taking him away from the tech front line. It is an annoyance that hasn't gone away. At one point, Mr Jenkins told the inquiry chair he wanted this \\\"over with\\\". Given the ongoing investigations, that seems unlikely.\",\n",

      "            \"body\": \"Fujitsu expert: I didn't think Horizon was a monster\\n\\n3 days ago By Tom Espiner , BBC business reporter Share\\n\\nBBC\\n\\nFormer Fujitsu engineer and Horizon expert Gareth Jenkins has said he didn't think the software was \\\"a monster\\\" and that he was \\\"trapped into doing things I shouldn't have done\\\". Speaking at an inquiry into the Horizon scandal, Mr Jenkins was accused by lawyer Flora Page of \\\"protecting\\\" it when he gave evidence as an expert witness between 2010 and 2013. Ms Page represents Horizon victims including former sub-postmaster Seema Misra, who Mr Jenkins gave evidence against in 2010. Ms Misra told the BBC the system was a monster which \\\"had blood on its hands, and so do the people who protect [it]\\\".\\n\\nBetween 1999 and 2015, the Post Office prosecuted hundreds of sub-postmasters on the strength of faulty Horizon data, with 700 convicted of offences such as theft and false accounting. Horizon falsely flagged discrepancies in accounts, with many sub-postmasters using their own savings to make good the imaginary shortfalls. The wrongful prosecutions, which have been called one of the biggest British miscarriages of justice, had a devastating effect on the lives of the sub-postmasters affected. They faced financial ruin and the loss of standing in their communities. Some sub-postmasters ended up taking their own lives after being pursued by the Post Office for supposed losses, including Martin Griffiths, whose widow was later paid in instalments by the Post Office for her silence, the inquiry heard in April.\\n\\nGiving his fourth day of evidence at the inquiry into the Horizon scandal, Mr Jenkins was questioned by Ms Page, a barrister who represented Horizon victims including Seema Misra. Ms Misra was pregnant with her second child when she was convicted of theft and sent to jail in 2010. She later told the BBC she would have killed herself had she not been pregnant at the time. In a charged atmosphere at the hearing, with Ms Misra sitting next to her, Ms Page accused Mr Jenkins of being a \\\"Fujitsu man\\\". She said Mr Jenkins \\\"knew the Misra trial was a test case for Horizon\\\". Ms Page alleged his role was to make sure Horizon had a \\\"clean bill of health\\\" and that he had \\\"tailored\\\" his evidence accordingly. \\\"My role was to tell the truth,\\\" Mr Jenkins said. \\\"I attempted to answer as best I could the questions I was asked\\\". Ms Page responded: \\\"Never mind whether a by-product of protecting the monster was that a woman was sent to jail\\\". Mr Jenkins said he was \\\"sorry for had happened to Mrs Misra\\\" but he felt that was down the to way that the Post Office had behaved and wasn't \\\"purely down to me\\\". \\\"I clearly got trapped into doing things I shouldn't have done, but that was not intentional on my behalf,\\\" he said.\\n\\nMr Jenkins was part of the Fujitsu team that developed the Horizon software, and part of his role was dealing with bugs in the system. Mr Jenkins has maintained throughout his evidence that he didn't understand his previous duties as an expert witness to tell the court about problems with Horizon, and that he didn't know that he shouldn't just narrowly answer questions about the technology. Under questioning at the inquiry on Friday, Mr Jenkins said: \\\"I appreciate that I got things very wrong, but it was done through ignorance rather than maliciousness\\\". He added that the Horizon system \\\"as a whole was working well\\\". Mr Jenkins is currently being investigated by the Metropolitan Police on suspicion of perjury - lying to a court, and perverting the course of justice. No criminal charges have been brought.\",\n",

      "            \"body\": \"IT expert 'pressurised' by Post Office over evidence\\n\\n4 days ago By Tom Espiner , BBC business reporter Share\\n\\nAlamy Thursday was the third day the inquiry heard from Gareth Jenkins. He will conclude his oral evidence on Friday\\n\\nA Fujitsu software expert who helped build the Horizon system has said he felt pressurised by the Post Office over evidence he gave in the 2010 prosecution of sub-postmistress Seema Misra. Gareth Jenkins said the Post Office \\\"clearly\\\" wanted him to say that \\\"everything was perfect, and I don't think I actually said that\\\". However, in an email discussing the case at the time, he said Mrs Misra had \\\"jumped on the bandwagon\\\" in blaming Horizon for shortfalls in accounts. Mrs Misra told the BBC that this was an example of a culture that went \\\"right through the Post Office... [that] Horizon is perfect\\\".\\n\\nMrs Misra was one of hundreds of sub-postmasters and postmistresses prosecuted by the Post Office between 1999 and 2015 on the strength of faulty data from the Horizon accounting system. The technology made it look as though money was missing from Post Office branch accounts when it wasn't. At Mrs Misra's trial in 2010 she was accused of theft and false accounting. The sub-postmistress from West Byfleet, Surrey, was found guilty and sent to prison when she was eight weeks pregnant. Her conviction was quashed in 2021.\\n\\nMr Jenkins said he felt, prior to the prosecution, that he was being pressurised by the Post Office to make out that Horizon was \\\"perfect\\\" in commenting on a report written by an expert witness for the defence. He added that the management of Mrs Misra's case was \\\"fairly chaotic\\\", and that requests from the Post Office legal department had been unclear. Nevertheless, in an email discussing Mrs Misra's case in 2010, he wrote that Mrs Misra \\\"saw an article in [tech publication] Computer Weekly indicating that Horizon was unreliable and decided to jump on the bandwagon\\\". Mr Jenkins said this was \\\"totally inappropriate wording\\\" and apologised. Lead counsel for the inquiry Jason Beer asked Mr Jenkins whether he had been able to give evidence dispassionately, or had he been \\\"afflicted\\\" with the belief that sub-postmasters were jumping on the bandwagon in blaming Horizon for shortfalls. Mr Jenkins said that he didn't think Horizon was the problem, and that there were \\\"other reasons\\\" for shortfalls. Responding to Mr Jenkins' evidence, Mrs Misra said she felt that the former Fujitsu engineer's comments showed the culture in the Post Office at the time, which was that sub-postmasters were to blame for shortfalls, rather than Horizon being at fault.\\n\\nGuidance sought\\n\\nThe inquiry was also shown an email sent on 27 January 2010 where Mr Jenkins had read a report on a separate prosecution and wrote that Horizon data \\u201cprobably needs some further investigation\\u201d. However, he said the decision to do so would be \\u201chighly political\\u201d. \\\"We don't really want to be seen to be undermining a Post Office prosecution!\\\" he wrote. Mr Jenkins said he wanted guidance from senior management on \\\"what exactly we should be doing\\\". Mr Beer asked: \\\"Why did you need guidance on whether or not Fujitsu should just present the facts irrespective of whether they supported or undermined a Post Office prosecution?\\\" Mr Jenkins replied: \\\"The guidance I got was to just tell the truth, which is what I would have liked to have done anyway.\\\" \\\"Did you need guidance from management on whether you should tell the truth or not?\\\" Mr Beer asked. Mr Jenkins said he would just tell the truth, but said he needed guidance from management on whether he was covered by management in this. Mr Beer asked: \\\"You needed top cover for telling the truth?\\\" Mr Jenkins responded: \\\"I don't know what to say to that.\\\" Mr Jenkins is being investigated by the Metropolitan Police for suspected perjury - lying to court.\\n\\n'I can't remember what I believed'\",\n",

Shares of the all-electric vehicle startup fell by about 2% to 6% for much of the event, eating into some of its 23% gain in shares the day before on news of an up to $5 billion investment by Volkswagen Group . Rivian's stock closed Thursday down 1.8% to $14.47 per share, off by roughly 39% year to date amid investor concerns regarding cash burn and a slowdown in EV sales. Rivian on Thursday reconfirmed its 2024 guidance that included production of 57,000 vehicles and a path to positive gross profit during the fourth quarter, including regulatory credits. It also outlined longer-term growths, such as plans to achieve positive adjusted earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization in 2027. \\\"Everything that you're hearing from us, around our product, around how we're running the business, around how we're driving toward profitability, my hope is that you're seeing really an extreme sense of urgency,\\\" Rivian CEO RJ Scaringe said during the event. \\\"We're very, very fast driving towards the improvements necessary to get to positive free cash flow and, before that, positive margins this year.\\\"\\n\\nStock Chart Icon Stock chart icon Rivian's stock performance\\n\\nRivian also outlined long-term financial targets of a roughly 25% gross margin, 10% free cash flow and adjusted profit margin in the \\\"high teens.\\\" The company did not release a time frame for these targets. Scaringe spent much of his time during the roughly four-hour presentation discussing efficiencies in products and manufacturing, which he said are expected to lead to 20% material cost reductions in its current vehicles, followed by 45% targeted reductions in its upcoming \\\"R2\\\" vehicles, which are projected to begin production in early 2026. The reductions range from physical savings, such as a 54% decrease in design costs of its R2 vehicles compared with current models, to lower costs on more complex systems such as battery packs and electrical hardware. For example, the company is using 10 fewer in-house electronic control units, or ECUs, in its recently redesigned R1 vehicles, allowing it to remove 1.6 miles in wiring harness length and 44 pounds out of the vehicle. Rivian's software expertise is at the center of VW's plans to invest $5 billion in the automaker by 2026, including an anticipated joint venture between the companies to create electrical architecture and software technology. Volkswagen is expected to use Rivian's electrical architecture and software stack for vehicles beginning in the second half of the decade, Scaringe said during the investment announcement. He said the joint venture does not include anything with battery technologies, vehicle propulsion platforms, high voltage systems or autonomy and electrical hardware.\\n\\nA provided image of Oliver Blume, CEO of Volkswagen Group and RJ Scaringe, founder and CEO of Rivian, as the companies announce joint venture plans on June 25, 2024.
