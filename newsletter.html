In mid-June, he disclosed a stake of 9.001 million GameStop shares after exiting his massive call options position.
GameStop shares fell more than 5% following the news.

The stock later fell into negative territory again in Thursday&#39;s session, closing the day down 0.3%.
There&#39;s also a strong connection between meme stock GameStop and Chewy.
GameStop CEO Ryan Cohen was the founder and CEO of Chewy, who was instrumental in PetSmart&#39;s takeover of Chewy in 2017 and its subsequent initial public offering in 2019.
He later took over as GameStop CEO in 2023, leading a turnaround in the brick-and-mortar video game retailer.</div>

The turbulent rally comes days after the investor, known for triggering the meme-stock rally of 2021, posted an uncaptioned picture of a puppy on the social media platform X that briefly sent Chewy shares to a near one-year high on Thursday.
Chewy reversed all its gains and entered the red shortly after the New York Stock Exchange opened on Monday.
The SEC, Chewy and Gill did not immediately respond to requests for comment.
The filing showed that Gill owns 9m shares of Chewy, equating to a stake worth about $245m at the stock’s Friday closing price of $27.24.</div>

Daniel Acker | Bloomberg | Getty ImagesBoeing said Monday that it will buy back its struggling fuselage maker Spirit AeroSystems in an all-stock deal that the plane maker has said will improve safety and quality control.
It said it agreed to pay $37.25 a share in Boeing stock for Spirit, giving the plane supplier an equity value of $4.7 billion.
Including Spirit&#39;s debt the deal has a transaction value of $8.3 billion Boeing said.

In buying Spirit, Boeing hopes to stem quality problems that have plagued the supplier in recent years.
While it already has significant influence over Spirit, Boeing will more easily be able to monitor and change production practices by owning the business.
The deal, which was widely expected, was valued at $4.7 billion in stock or $8.3 billion including Spirit’s debt.

Shares and bonds of Adani Group companies swung wildly in the immediate aftermath of Hindenburg’s report but have since recovered ground.
Adani Group stocks shrugged off the latest missive from Hindenburg.
As of June 1, the Kingdon fund returned $4.1 million of the gains from the Adani short sale to Hindenburg while another $1.4 million has yet to be shared, according to Sebi.

                            <div class="summary">The disclosure of the SEBI notice adds a new twist in the saga that began last year when Hindenburg, founded by Nathan Anderson, alleged improper business dealings by Adani.
In the notice, SEBI alleges Hindenburg colluded with its client Kingdon Capital Management by providing a draft of its report on Adani Group before it was released publicly.
SEBI alleges that Mark Kingdon, the owner of Kingdon Capital, then set up a fund able to trade Indian equities known as K Indian Opportunities Fund.
That fund created short positions in Adani group stocks between Jan. 10, 2023, and Jan. 20, 2023, five days ahead of the Hindenburg report being published, according to the SEBI documents.
Hindenburg&#39;s response sheds some light on the mechanics of its Adani short trade, the details of which intrigued other investors because Indian securities rules make it hard for foreigners to bet against companies there.</div>
