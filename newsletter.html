                            <div class="summary">The Biden administration is pausing student loan payments for about three million borrowers who are enrolled in its new repayment plan as it defends the program in court against Republican-backed lawsuits.
The preliminary injunctions are a result of lawsuits filed earlier this year by Republican-led states, including Florida, Arkansas and Missouri.
The states argued that the Biden administration was overstepping its authority and trying to find a roundabout way to forgive student debt after the Supreme Court blocked its sweeping plan last year.
Under the SAVE plan, many borrowers pay just 5% of their discretionary income toward their debt each month, and its guidelines state anyone making $32,800 or less has a $0 monthly payment.
It also expedited the timeline after which many borrowers receive the full cancellation of their debt.</div>

                            <div class="summary">President Biden’s new student loan repayment plan was hobbled on Monday after two federal judges in Kansas and Missouri issued separate rulings that temporarily blocked some of the plan’s benefits, leaving questions about its fate.
That means the Biden administration cannot reduce borrowers’ monthly bills by as much as half starting July 1, as had been scheduled, and it must pause debt forgiveness to SAVE enrollees.
The administration has canceled $5.5 billion in debt for more than 414,000 borrowers through the plan, which opened in August.
If you’re among the eight million borrowers making payments through SAVE — the Saving on a Valuable Education plan — you probably have many questions.
Here’s what we know so far, though the Education Department has yet to release its official guidance.</div>

                            <div class="summary">By Daniel Wiessner(Reuters) -A federal judge in Texas on Friday temporarily blocked a Biden administration rule from taking effect that would extend mandatory overtime pay to 4 million salaried U.S. workers.
U.S. District Judge Sean Jordan in Sherman, Texas, said the U.S. Department of Labor rule that is set to go into effect on Monday improperly bases eligibility for overtime pay on workers&#39; wages rather than their job duties.
The Labor Department and the office of Republican Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton did not immediately respond to requests for comment.
Texas in its lawsuit said the rule violates federal law by conditioning overtime exemptions primarily on workers&#39; pay rather than their duties, and is seeking to strike it down nationwide.
Jordan on Friday agreed that the Labor Department had overstepped its authority by effectively rewriting federal law.</div>
