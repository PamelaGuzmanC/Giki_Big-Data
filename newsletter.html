                            <div class="summary">Boeing has agreed a $4.7bn (£3.7bn) deal to buy the parts supplier it sold nearly 20 years ago, as it seeks to improve safety on its production lines after a panel blew off an Alaska Airlines-operated plane mid-flight earlier this year.
The under-pressure US planemaker will buy Spirit Aerosystems, which supplies it with fuselage and wing parts, as it attempts to improve safety and quality in its manufacturing processes.
The deal to bring Spirit back in house marks a shift away from Boeing outsourcing key components for its planes.
after newsletter promotionIt was revealed on Sunday that the US Department of Justice is poised to charge Boeing with fraud.
Attorneys representing the relatives accused the federal government of cooking up “another sweetheart plea deal” with Boeing.</div>

                            <div class="summary">Boeing said on Monday that it had agreed to buy a major supplier, Spirit AeroSystems, ending a nearly two-decade experiment in outsourcing production of major components of its commercial planes, including the body of the 737 Max and parts of the 767, 777 and 787.
In buying Spirit, Boeing hopes to stem quality problems that have plagued the supplier in recent years.
While it already has significant influence over Spirit, Boeing will more easily be able to monitor and change production practices by owning the business outright.
The deal, which was widely expected, was valued at $4.7 billion in stock or $8.3 billion including Spirit’s debt.
Boeing said its acquisition of Spirit is expected to close by the middle of next year.</div>

                            <div class="summary">The Supreme Court issued two separate rulings on Friday that take direct aim at the power of the federal government.
In what&#39;s widely known as the Chevron case, the court took a step to curb the ability of the ballooning federal bureaucracy to bypass Congress with backdoor regulations.
The original Chevron decision allowed federal agencies to unilaterally fill in the details whenever government officials claimed the laws passed by Congress were too ambiguous.
The Capitol Riot and ObstructionIn the other major case, the Supreme Court made it harder to charge Capitol riot defendants with obstruction, a charge that also has been brought against former President Donald Trump.
It&#39;s unclear how the court&#39;s decision might affect the obstruction case by Special Counsel Jack Smith against Trump in Washington.</div>

                            <div class="summary">The Supreme Court on Friday reduced the power of executive agencies by sweeping aside a longstanding legal precedent, endangering countless regulations and transferring power from the executive branch to Congress and the courts.
The precedent, Chevron v. Natural Resources Defense Council, one of the most cited in American law, requires courts to defer to agencies’ reasonable interpretations of ambiguous statutes.
There have been 70 Supreme Court decisions relying on Chevron, along with 17,000 in the lower courts.
The decision is all but certain to prompt challenges to the actions of an array of federal agencies, including those regulating the environment, health care and consumer safety.

&#34;Vice President Harris is a risky choice, but certainly has the visibility and is the logical choice,&#34; said Bose.
&#34;It&#39;s difficult to see how you open up the Democratic presidential nomination now and have a unified path to victory in November,&#34; she added.
&#34;If the Democrats are going to have a change at the top of the ticket, President Biden has to endorse it and, frankly, probably initiate it.&#34;</div>

And that’s what Joe Biden has been doing his entire life,” Warnock said.
It was an echo of the message from other supporters that Biden had a bad debate, but a lifetime of good governance.
But concern simmered among some Democrats that Biden’s campaign and the Democratic National Committee were not taking seriously enough the impact of the debate.

                            <div class="summary">The owner of the Port Talbot steelworks has written to trade unions offering fresh talks amid a battle to delay plans to cut 2,800 jobs and suspend production at a site that has been in operation since 1951.
Other elements that will close include the harbour, sinter plant, ore yards and primary steelmaking, bringing to a halt more than 70 years of steelmaking in Port Talbot.
The plans were brought forward after the Unite union announced indefinite strike action beginning on 8 July.
However, the company wants to mothball Port Talbot during construction, leaving thousands of local people without work in a town where Tata is the main employer.
This would include the £500m already pledged to Port Talbot.</div>

                            <div class="summary">Union calls off Port Talbot strike action16 minutes ago By Simon Jack , BBC business editor ShareGetty ImagesThe Unite union has called off a strike planned for 8 July so further talks can take place over the future of the UK’s largest steel works at Port Talbot in Wales.
Owners Tata had threatened to bring forward the planned closure of both remaining blast furnaces the day before the strike, citing safety fears due to a staff walkout.
Unite’s strike action was called to the dismay of other unions who feared that it would accelerate the closure of blast furnace number four which was not due to be shut down until September.
The Community and GMB unions had hoped that would give them time for more negotiations to extend the life of the remaining furnace with a potentially new government in place.
Sources close to the matter told the BBC that Unite had given Tata the perfect excuse to shut down early, accelerating job losses.</div>

The union wants the company to delay the closure of the heavy end of steel production in Port Talbot, which is due to happen by the end of September.
Community and GMB have a mandate from their members for strike action but have not confirmed any dates, saying they would wait until after the general election before announcing their next moves.
On Sunday it wrote to all three unions, offering to begin new talks if the strike was called off.

However, the company previously said it would not be changing course in Port Talbot, regardless of who wins the general election.
About 2,800 Tata Steel workers will lose their jobs when the company closes both blast furnaces in Port Talbot by the end of September.
A spokesperson for Tata said: &#34;Following the announcement by Unite union to unilaterally call strike action from 8 July, Tata Steel is unfortunately forced to commence legal action to challenge the validity of Unite&#39;s ballot.
However, the decision to walk out indefinitely is an escalation which now potentially threatens the early closure of the UK’s largest steelmaking operation in Port Talbot.</div>

                            <div class="summary">House prices in the UK remain unaffordable for many households despite wages rising above inflation for the typical earner, Nationwide has said.
On an annual basis house price growth accelerated from 1.3% in May to 1.5% in June, leaving prices about 3% below the record high set in summer 2022.
The average price of a UK home was £266,604 in June, Nationwide said.
House prices in the UK fell last year as households came under pressure from 14 consecutive interest rate rises from the Bank of England, but they remain at historically high levels relative to earnings.
Prices returned to growth earlier this year, but activity has been constrained by persistently higher borrowing costs and prices remaining unaffordable for many households.</div>

                            <div class="source">New York Times</div>
                            <div class="summary">The Supreme Court said on Thursday that members of the Sackler family cannot be shielded from liability for civil claims related to the opioid epidemic, jeopardizing a bankruptcy plan that would have offered such protection in exchange for channeling billions of dollars toward addressing the crisis.
In a 5-to-4 decision, the justices found that the deal, carefully negotiated over years with states, tribes, local governments and individuals, had broken a basic tenet of bankruptcy law by shielding members of the Sackler family from lawsuits without the consent of those who might sue.
The plan for Purdue Pharma, the maker of the prescription painkiller OxyContin, the drug widely considered to have ignited the crisis, was unusual because it offered broad protections that the Sackler family, who controlled the company, had demanded for years even as the Sacklers avoided declaring bankruptcy themselves.
“The Sacklers have not filed for bankruptcy and have not placed virtually all their assets on the table for distribution to creditors, yet they seek what essentially amounts to a discharge,” Justice Neil M. Gorsuch wrote, joined by Justices Clarence Thomas, Samuel A. Alito Jr., Amy Coney Barrett and Ketanji Brown Jackson.</div>

                            <div class="summary">But the nation&#39;s top court ruled that granting such protections to the Sacklers, who did not themselves declare bankruptcy was not authorised under law.
Sackler family members said they would continue to push for a settlement, warning that the alternative was &#34;costly and chaotic legal proceedings in courtrooms across the country&#34;.
&#34;I&#39;m just so grateful to the Supreme Court right now I can&#39;t get beyond that.&#34;
&#34;The Sacklers have not agreed to place anything approaching their full assets on the table for opioid victims, &#34; he wrote.
When the Supreme Court heard arguments last year, dozens of protesters opposing the deal showed up, holding signs such as &#34;my dead son does not release the Sacklers&#34;.</div>

In contrast, their American and Japanese peers take significantly fewer days off work and seem largely satisfied with it.
In 2022, the average worker spent 1,811 hours working through the year compared to 1,341 hours and 1,511 hours in Germany and France, respectively.

National Energy Action (NEA) has estimated that about 5.6 million households in Great Britain will remain in fuel poverty over the summer, even with lower prices.
This has left European markets more exposed to global energy price fluctuations as it relies more on imports from the US and the Middle East.
Europe’s gas market prices were lower in the early months of the year after a relatively mild winter, allowing energy bills to fall this summer.
has urged households to take a meter reading as close to 30 June as possible “to ensure you don’t pay over the odds for any energy used after the new price cap takes effect”.</div>

Leading consultancy Cornwall Insight predicts that a typical household&#39;s annual bill will be back up to £1,723 in October, a £155, or 10%, increase from now.
However, a typical household&#39;s energy bill remains about £400 higher than three years ago, prompting debate over the issue during the election campaign.
The vast majority of households pay by direct debit, and their payments are smoothed out over the year.
Ofgem is reviewing the way the price cap is calculated, including sifting through a host of responses to a consultation on standing charges.</div>

NASA and Boeing say the delay for testing is solely to gather more data about the spacecraft&#39;s performance, in particular its thruster system.

Instead, the astronauts, Butch Wilmore and Suni Williams, will remain on the station for several weeks longer as NASA and Boeing engineers continue to study misbehaving thrusters on the vehicle.
But don’t call the astronauts stuck or stranded, officials said on Friday.
“We’re not stuck on I.S.S.,” Mark Nappi, the program manager at Boeing for Starliner, said during a news conference on Friday.

Affordable homes Social rents are calculated taking into account local earnings and property values, while affordable rents can be up to 80% of the going rate in the private rented sector, and are typically set at that level.
In 2022/23 the median weekly social rent hit £89, the equivalent figure for affordable rents was £134.
That’s across England as a whole: in some parts of the country, affordable rents are double social rents, according to analysis by Inside Housing magazine.
And since the new type of rented housing was launched, the number of homes being built for social rent has plummeted.</div>

And analysis by BBC Scotland News suggests that new licences will only extend the life of the North Sea by up to five years at today&#39;s production levels.
The North Sea Transition Authority (NSTA) - which issues licences - estimates that about two billion barrels of &#34;unlicenced&#34; oil remains.
It is now 25 years since production peaked in the North Sea.
The suggestion that 100,000 North Sea jobs could be at risk without new exploration licences came from Aberdeen and Grampian Chamber of Commerce.</div>

The deal will help Rivian, which has never turned a quarterly profit, make more electric vehicles and help convince investors of its stability.
Rivian, which was founded in 2009 as Mainstream Motors, had billions in investments by 2021, including from Amazon, BlackRock and Ford.
But as the case with many new electric vehicle companies, Rivian has also experienced hiccups in trying to ramp up to production, made harder by supply chain issues during the pandemic.
In March, Rivian said it would pause construction of a $5 billion factory in Georgia to save money.</div>
