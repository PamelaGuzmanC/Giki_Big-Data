UK: &#39;Biden struggles ... Trump lies&#39;In the U.K., the Guardian pointed to issues with both Biden and Trump at the debate, headlining its story: &#34;Biden struggles to land lines as Trump lies in first presidential debate.&#34;
Meanwhile, the BBC suggested Biden struggled with Trump&#39;s attacks, titling its live blog of the debate: &#34;Biden stumbles in first presidential debate as Trump avoids key questions.&#34;
Biden struggled repeatedly and Trump repeated falsehoods, it said, adding that the debate was &#34;marked by personal attacks.&#34;
In another story, the newspaper summarized the debate: &#34;Biden disgraces himself, Trump wastes his chance, but the true losers of the first TV debate in the U.S. election campaigns are the Americans.&#34;</div>

Among the keenest watchers will be executives and investors looking for signs about how the candidates might handle the economy and business in a second term.
There will be plenty to scrutinize in the 90-minute, audience-free debate, including what the candidates say and how they say it.
What will Biden and Trump say about some of the key issues?
In Thursday night’s debate, “markets probably care more about presentation than policy pledges,” Paul Donovan, an economist at UBS, wrote in a client note.</div>

                            <div class="summary">The Supreme Court issued two separate rulings on Friday that take direct aim at the power of the federal government.
In what&#39;s widely known as the Chevron case, the court took a step to curb the ability of the ballooning federal bureaucracy to bypass Congress with backdoor regulations.
The original Chevron decision allowed federal agencies to unilaterally fill in the details whenever government officials claimed the laws passed by Congress were too ambiguous.
The Capitol Riot and ObstructionIn the other major case, the Supreme Court made it harder to charge Capitol riot defendants with obstruction, a charge that also has been brought against former President Donald Trump.
It&#39;s unclear how the court&#39;s decision might affect the obstruction case by Special Counsel Jack Smith against Trump in Washington.</div>

                            <div class="summary">The Supreme Court on Friday reduced the power of executive agencies by sweeping aside a longstanding legal precedent, endangering countless regulations and transferring power from the executive branch to Congress and the courts.
The precedent, Chevron v. Natural Resources Defense Council, one of the most cited in American law, requires courts to defer to agencies’ reasonable interpretations of ambiguous statutes.
There have been 70 Supreme Court decisions relying on Chevron, along with 17,000 in the lower courts.
The decision is all but certain to prompt challenges to the actions of an array of federal agencies, including those regulating the environment, health care and consumer safety.

It also outlined longer-term growths, such as plans to achieve positive adjusted earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization in 2027.
Volkswagen is expected to use Rivian&#39;s electrical architecture and software stack for vehicles beginning in the second half of the decade, Scaringe said during the investment announcement.
He said the joint venture does not include anything with battery technologies, vehicle propulsion platforms, high voltage systems or autonomy and electrical hardware.

The additional $4 billion is expected by 2026.
Shares of Rivian soared more than 50% during after-hours trading Tuesday, two days ahead of an investor event for Rivian, which has been under pressure from Wall Street due to its cash burn and significant losses.
The initial $1 billion from Volkswagen will be in the form of a convertible note, which could be converted to Rivian shares on or after Dec. 1, the release said.
The deal will help Rivian on its journey to become cash flow-positive, Rivian CEO and founder RJ Scaringe said Tuesday night during an investor call.</div>

The deal will help Rivian, which has never turned a quarterly profit, make more electric vehicles and help convince investors of its stability.
Rivian, which was founded in 2009 as Mainstream Motors, had billions in investments by 2021, including from Amazon, BlackRock and Ford.
But as the case with many new electric vehicle companies, Rivian has also experienced hiccups in trying to ramp up to production, made harder by supply chain issues during the pandemic.
In March, Rivian said it would pause construction of a $5 billion factory in Georgia to save money.</div>

For the JV, Rivian will contribute its expertise in the field of electronic architecture for software-defined vehicles and the associated IP via a fully paid-up license.
The company reiterated its forecast to be near a positive gross margin in the fourth quarter, and it set a long-term target of a 25% gross margin.
Rivian remains a high-risk/high-reward stock given its early-stage nature and still negative gross margin.

Micron shares fell about 7% in extended trading on Wednesday as investors looked past better-than-expected results and focused instead on a revenue forecast that was in line with estimates.
Analysts were expecting earnings per share of $1.05 on revenue of $7.6 billion.
Micron CEO Sanjay Mehrotra highlighted the company&#39;s AI business in a statement while saying that its smartphone and PC markets remain sluggish.
&#34;We believe that Micron will be one of the biggest beneficiaries in the semiconductor industry in the multiyear growth opportunity driven by AI,&#34; Mehrotra said.</div>

Before launching on June 5, Boeing and NASA planned for Starliner to be in space for nine days.
As of Friday, the Starliner flight has tallied 24 days and counting.
NASA and Boeing say the delay for testing is solely to gather more data about the spacecraft&#39;s performance, in particular its thruster system.
The Starliner crew flight test represents a final major step before NASA certifies Boeing to fly crew on operational, six-month missions.</div>

                            <div class="source">New York Times</div>
                            <div class="date">2024-06-27</div>
                            <div class="summary">The Supreme Court said on Thursday that members of the Sackler family cannot be shielded from liability for civil claims related to the opioid epidemic, jeopardizing a bankruptcy plan that would have offered such protection in exchange for channeling billions of dollars toward addressing the crisis.
In a 5-to-4 decision, the justices found that the deal, carefully negotiated over years with states, tribes, local governments and individuals, had broken a basic tenet of bankruptcy law by shielding members of the Sackler family from lawsuits without the consent of those who might sue.
The plan for Purdue Pharma, the maker of the prescription painkiller OxyContin, the drug widely considered to have ignited the crisis, was unusual because it offered broad protections that the Sackler family, who controlled the company, had demanded for years even as the Sacklers avoided declaring bankruptcy themselves.
“The Sacklers have not filed for bankruptcy and have not placed virtually all their assets on the table for distribution to creditors, yet they seek what essentially amounts to a discharge,” Justice Neil M. Gorsuch wrote, joined by Justices Clarence Thomas, Samuel A. Alito Jr., Amy Coney Barrett and Ketanji Brown Jackson.</div>

                            <div class="summary">But the nation&#39;s top court ruled that granting such protections to the Sacklers, who did not themselves declare bankruptcy was not authorised under law.
Sackler family members said they would continue to push for a settlement, warning that the alternative was &#34;costly and chaotic legal proceedings in courtrooms across the country&#34;.
&#34;I&#39;m just so grateful to the Supreme Court right now I can&#39;t get beyond that.&#34;
&#34;The Sacklers have not agreed to place anything approaching their full assets on the table for opioid victims, &#34; he wrote.
When the Supreme Court heard arguments last year, dozens of protesters opposing the deal showed up, holding signs such as &#34;my dead son does not release the Sacklers&#34;.</div>

                            <div class="summary">The owner of the Port Talbot steelworks has written to trade unions offering fresh talks amid a battle to delay plans that would see 2,800 jobs lost and production suspended at a site that has been in operation since 1951.
Other elements that will close include the harbour, sinter plant, ore yards and primary steelmaking, bringing to a halt more than 70 years of steelmaking in Port Talbot.
The plans were brought forward after the Unite union announced indefinite strike action beginning on 8 July.
However, the company wants to mothball Port Talbot during construction, leaving thousands of local people without work in a town where Tata is the main employer.
This would include the £500m already pledged to Port Talbot.</div>

                            <div class="summary">Labour politicians have been urged to step in to help avert a “costly mistake” by Tata Steel, which has told staff it could close operations at its steel plant in Port Talbot just days after the general election.
About 1,500 workers across Port Talbot and another site at Llanwern intend to strike over Tata’s decision to close its blast furnaces, cutting 2,800 jobs.
The decision has angered politicians and unions, who have argued that the Tata should wait until after next Thursday’s general election, which Labour is predicted to win.
He said that meeting had happened on Friday morning and safety plans were still being discussed with the company.
Vaughan Gething, leader of Welsh Labour, said: “We will not support the closure of both furnaces.</div>

                            <div class="summary">Multinational conglomerate Tata is set to shut the Port Talbot steelworks earlier than first announced over strike plans.
&#34;The Unite campaign is not about selling jobs, it&#39;s about securing the long-term future of steel making in this country for thousands of workers in Port Talbot and South Wales.
The GMB union also voiced its support, saying &#34;Tata must step back from this irreversible decision and safeguard steelmaking assets.
A Tata Steel spokesperson said Unite&#39;s strike announcement was made unilaterally and it is &#34;unfortunately forced to commence legal action to challenge the validity of Unite&#39;s ballot&#34;.
Urgent and good faith negotiations are required to ensure safety on site and avoid a severe and lasting impact on Port Talbot, Wales and the UK.&#34;</div>

However, the company previously said it would not be changing course in Port Talbot, regardless of who wins the general election.
About 2,800 Tata Steel workers will lose their jobs when the company closes both blast furnaces in Port Talbot by the end of September.
A spokesperson for Tata said: &#34;Following the announcement by Unite union to unilaterally call strike action from 8 July, Tata Steel is unfortunately forced to commence legal action to challenge the validity of Unite&#39;s ballot.
However, the decision to walk out indefinitely is an escalation which now potentially threatens the early closure of the UK’s largest steelmaking operation in Port Talbot.</div>
