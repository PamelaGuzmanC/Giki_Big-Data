                            <div class="summary">The Supreme Court issued two separate rulings on Friday that take direct aim at the power of the federal government.
In what&#39;s widely known as the Chevron case, the court took a step to curb the ability of the ballooning federal bureaucracy to bypass Congress with backdoor regulations.
The original Chevron decision allowed federal agencies to unilaterally fill in the details whenever government officials claimed the laws passed by Congress were too ambiguous.
The Capitol Riot and ObstructionIn the other major case, the Supreme Court made it harder to charge Capitol riot defendants with obstruction, a charge that also has been brought against former President Donald Trump.
It&#39;s unclear how the court&#39;s decision might affect the obstruction case by Special Counsel Jack Smith against Trump in Washington.</div>

                            <div class="summary">The Supreme Court on Friday reduced the power of executive agencies by sweeping aside a longstanding legal precedent, endangering countless regulations and transferring power from the executive branch to Congress and the courts.
The precedent, Chevron v. Natural Resources Defense Council, one of the most cited in American law, requires courts to defer to agencies’ reasonable interpretations of ambiguous statutes.
There have been 70 Supreme Court decisions relying on Chevron, along with 17,000 in the lower courts.
The decision is all but certain to prompt challenges to the actions of an array of federal agencies, including those regulating the environment, health care and consumer safety.
“Courts must exercise their independent judgment in deciding whether an agency has acted within its statutory authority.”</div>

Justice Department attorneys and victims&#39; family members and their lawyers spoke for about two hours on Sunday, discussing the plan, lawyers said.
Boeing declined to comment, and it wasn&#39;t immediately clear if it would accept a plea deal.
Under that agreement, Boeing said it would pay $2.5 billion.
The plea deal would require Boeing to pay an additional fine of about $247 million and call for the installation of an outside monitor on Boeing, according to Paul Cassell, one of the lawyers.</div>

Federal officials shared details of the offer on a call with the families on Sunday afternoon before bringing the deal to Boeing, according to the lawyers, Paul G. Cassell and Mark Lindquist.
The terms include a nearly $244 million fine, a new investment in safety improvements, three years of scrutiny from an external monitor, and a meeting between Boeing’s board and the victims’ families, said Mr. Cassell, a University of Utah law professor.

&#34;Vice President Harris is a risky choice, but certainly has the visibility and is the logical choice,&#34; said Bose.

                            <div class="summary">House prices in the UK remain unaffordable for many households despite wages rising above inflation for the typical earner, Nationwide has said.
On an annual basis house price growth accelerated from 1.3% in May to 1.5% in June, leaving prices about 3% below the record high set in summer 2022.
The average price of a UK home was £266,064 in June, Nationwide said.
House prices in the UK fell last year as households came under pressure from 14 consecutive interest rate rises from the Bank of England, but they remain at historically high levels relative to earnings.
Prices returned to growth earlier this year, but activity has been constrained by persistently higher borrowing costs and prices remaining unaffordable for many households.</div>

Despite wages rising above the rate of inflation in recent months and house prices falling from the record high of summer 2022, &#34;housing affordability is still stretched&#34;, Nationwide said.
The mortgages affectWhile people have been typically earning more and house prices are 3% lower than the all-time high two years ago, rising mortgage costs have made unaffordability worse.
Compounding affordability problems is the fact UK house prices are back on the rise and were 1.5% more last month compared to June 2023.

Robert Gardner, Nationwide&#39;s chief economist, said that mortgage rates are &#34;still well above the record lows prevailing in 2021 in the wake of the pandemic&#34;.
Despite some major lenders cutting their mortgage rates last week, home loan costs remain far higher than pre-pandemic levels.
&#34;Either way, we’re not expecting massive overnight drops in mortgage rates, so the reaction is more likely to be a muted upturn in sentiment than an overwhelming wave of optimism.&#34;

                            <div class="summary">The Supreme Court said on Thursday that members of the Sackler family cannot be shielded from liability for civil claims related to the opioid epidemic, jeopardizing a bankruptcy plan that would have offered such protection in exchange for channeling billions of dollars toward addressing the crisis.
In a 5-to-4 decision, the justices found that the deal, carefully negotiated over years with states, tribes, local governments and individuals, had broken a basic tenet of bankruptcy law by shielding members of the Sackler family from lawsuits without the consent of those who might sue.
The plan for Purdue Pharma, the maker of the prescription painkiller OxyContin, the drug widely considered to have ignited the crisis, was unusual because it offered broad protections that the Sackler family, who controlled the company, had demanded for years even as the Sacklers avoided declaring bankruptcy themselves.
“The Sacklers have not filed for bankruptcy and have not placed virtually all their assets on the table for distribution to creditors, yet they seek what essentially amounts to a discharge,” Justice Neil M. Gorsuch wrote, joined by Justices Clarence Thomas, Samuel A. Alito Jr., Amy Coney Barrett and Ketanji Brown Jackson.</div>

Sackler family members said they would continue to push for a settlement, warning that the alternative was &#34;costly and chaotic legal proceedings in courtrooms across the country&#34;.
&#34;I&#39;m just so grateful to the Supreme Court right now I can&#39;t get beyond that.&#34;
&#34;The Sacklers have not agreed to place anything approaching their full assets on the table for opioid victims, &#34; he wrote.

Nationwide customers faced similar issues in March, while HSBC customers suffered an outage lasting over 24 hours in November.</div>

Volkswagen is expected to use Rivian&#39;s electrical architecture and software stack for vehicles beginning in the second half of the decade, Scaringe said during the investment announcement.
He said the joint venture does not include anything with battery technologies, vehicle propulsion platforms, high voltage systems or autonomy and electrical hardware.

Rivian, which was founded in 2009 as Mainstream Motors, had billions in investments by 2021, including from Amazon, BlackRock and Ford.
But as the case with many new electric vehicle companies, Rivian has also experienced hiccups in trying to ramp up to production, made harder by supply chain issues during the pandemic.

Affordable homes Social rents are calculated taking into account local earnings and property values, while affordable rents can be up to 80% of the going rate in the private rented sector, and are typically set at that level.
In 2022/23 the median weekly social rent hit £89, the equivalent figure for affordable rents was £134.
That’s across England as a whole: in some parts of the country, affordable rents are double social rents, according to analysis by Inside Housing magazine.
And since the new type of rented housing was launched, the number of homes being built for social rent has plummeted.</div>

                            <div class="summary">Boeing has agreed a $4.7bn (£3.7bn) deal to buy the parts supplier it sold nearly 20 years ago, as it seeks to improve safety on its production lines after a panel blew off an Alaska Airlines-operated plane mid-flight earlier this year.
The under-pressure US planemaker will buy Spirit Aerosystems, which supplies it with fuselage and wing parts, as it attempts to improve safety and quality in its manufacturing processes.
The deal to bring Spirit back in house marks a shift away from Boeing outsourcing key components for its planes.

Attorneys representing the relatives accused the federal government of cooking up “another sweetheart plea deal” with Boeing.</div>

                            <div class="summary">Boeing said on Monday that it had agreed to buy a major supplier, Spirit AeroSystems, ending a nearly two-decade experiment in outsourcing production of major components of its commercial planes, including the body of the 737 Max and parts of the 767, 777 and 787.
In buying Spirit, Boeing hopes to stem quality problems that have plagued the supplier in recent years.
While it already has significant influence over Spirit, Boeing will more easily be able to monitor and change production practices by owning the business outright.
The deal, which was widely expected, was valued at $4.7 billion in stock or $8.3 billion including Spirit’s debt.
Boeing said its acquisition of Spirit is expected to close by the middle of next year.</div>

Unite’s strike action was called to the dismay of other unions who feared that it would accelerate the closure of blast furnace number four, which was not due to be shut down until September.
On Thursday Tata said it would close both furnaces within days unless it could &#34;safely and stably operate&#34; them during the strike.
Then it wrote to all three unions, offering to begin new talks if the strike was called off.

National Energy Action (NEA) has estimated that about 5.6 million households in Great Britain will remain in fuel poverty over the summer, even with lower prices.
This has left European markets more exposed to global energy price fluctuations as it relies more on imports from the US and the Middle East.
Europe’s gas market prices were lower in the early months of the year after a relatively mild winter, allowing energy bills to fall this summer.

Igor Golovniov | SOPA Images | LightRocket | Getty ImagesFacebook parent company Meta was on Monday accused by EU regulators of failing to comply with the bloc&#39;s landmark antitrust rules over its recently introduced ad-supported social networking service.
A Meta spokesperson told CNBC in a statement that its ad-supported subscription model &#34;follows the direction of the highest court in Europe and complies with the DMA.&#34;
Meta has previously pointed to this ruling as a reason for introducing the subscription offer.
The other reason cited by the EU is that the Meta ad-supported service doesn&#39;t allow users to exercise their right to &#34;freely consent&#34; for their personal data to be used to target them with online ads.</div>

                            <div class="summary">Mark Zuckerberg’s Meta has breached the EU’s new digital laws with an advertising model that charges users for ad-free versions of Facebook and Instagram, according to the European Commission.
Users who do not pay consent, as part of the signing up process for the platforms, to their data being used to tailor personalised adverts that appear in their social media feeds.
It said in order to comply with the DMA, Meta must launch “equivalent” versions of Facebook and Instagram that use less of people’s data.
A Meta spokesperson said the new model had been designed to comply the DMA and other regulatory demands.
The commission said last week that Apple had breached the DMA by restricting competition on its app store.</div>

                            <div class="summary">Boeing&#39;s crew flight test represents the first time Starliner is carrying people, flying NASA astronauts Butch Wilmore and Suni Williams.
Before launching on June 5, Boeing and NASA planned for Starliner to be in space for nine days.
As of Friday, the Starliner flight has tallied 24 days and counting.
NASA and Boeing say the delay for testing is solely to gather more data about the spacecraft&#39;s performance, in particular its thruster system.
The Starliner crew flight test represents a final major step before NASA certifies Boeing to fly crew on operational, six-month missions.</div>

Instead, the astronauts, Butch Wilmore and Suni Williams, will remain on the station for several weeks longer as NASA and Boeing engineers continue to study misbehaving thrusters on the vehicle.
But don’t call the astronauts stuck or stranded, officials said on Friday.
“We’re not stuck on I.S.S.,” Mark Nappi, the program manager at Boeing for Starliner, said during a news conference on Friday.
“The crew is not in any danger.”</div>

It was not immediately clear how long he might be tied to Spirit, with the Boeing deal not due to close until mid-2025.

The U.S. SEC, Chewy and Gill did not immediately respond to requests for comment.
The filing showed Gill owns 9 million shares of Chewy, equating to a stake worth about $245 million at the stock&#39;s Friday closing price of $27.24.
The stake would make Gill Chewy&#39;s third-largest shareholder, according to LSEG data.
