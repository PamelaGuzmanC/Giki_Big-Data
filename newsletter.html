                            <div class="summary">Sopa Images | Lightrocket | Getty ImagesThe Japanese yen weakened to fresh 38-year lows on Friday, crossing the 161 mark against the dollar for the first time since 1986 and reaching a high of 161.27, according to LSEG data.
The yen has been steadily deprecating since the Bank of Japan ended its negative interest rate policy and scrapped its yield curve control policy in March.
Following the move, the currency crossed the 150 mark against the dollar, reaching 160 in late April before the country&#39;s finance ministry intervened.

The benchmark U.S. federal funds rate stands at 5.25% to 5.5%, while the Bank of Japan&#39;s benchmark interest rate is at 0%-0.1%.</div>

The 160 yen level of course is a large round psychologically significant figure and an area that I think a lot of people are going to pay attention to it.
Market memory comes into picture, and we could see buyers there, but even if we pull back from there, the market I think has plenty of support near the 158 yen level, possibly even the 155 yen level.
So, with that being said, I think you’ve got a situation where you continue to buy dips.

The warning signs led shares to close 20% lower on Friday -- making it the worst trading day in the company&#39;s history since its IPO in Dec. 1980.
As Wall Street digested the dismal outlook from the world&#39;s largest sportswear company, at least six investment banks downgraded Nike&#39;s stock.

                            <div class="summary">A former Fujitsu engineer has been accused by a lawyer acting for victims of the Post Office scandal of “hiding” problems with the Horizon IT system to protect the “out of control monster”, a public inquiry heard.
Gareth Jenkins, formerly a senior engineer at Fujitsu, which developed the Horizon IT system, faced tough questioning by lawyers acting for post office operators caught up in the scandal, which has been described as one of the biggest miscarriages of justice in recent history.
The Post Office prosecuted hundreds of operators, blaming them for financial losses in their branches when in fact the Post Office Horizon IT system was unreliable and had bugs, errors and defects.
Jenkins was an expert witness for the Post Office at her trial.

                            <div class="summary">The Supreme Court said on Thursday that members of the Sackler family cannot be shielded from liability for civil claims related to the opioid epidemic, jeopardizing a bankruptcy plan that would have offered such protection in exchange for channeling billions of dollars toward addressing the crisis.
In a 5-to-4 decision, the justices found that the deal, carefully negotiated over years with states, tribes, local governments and individuals, had broken a basic tenet of bankruptcy law by shielding members of the Sackler family from lawsuits without the consent of those who might sue.
The plan for Purdue Pharma, the maker of the prescription painkiller OxyContin, the drug widely considered to have ignited the crisis, was unusual because it offered broad protections that the Sackler family, who controlled the company, had demanded for years even as the Sacklers avoided declaring bankruptcy themselves.
“The Sacklers have not filed for bankruptcy and have not placed virtually all their assets on the table for distribution to creditors, yet they seek what essentially amounts to a discharge,” Justice Neil M. Gorsuch wrote, joined by Justices Clarence Thomas, Samuel A. Alito Jr., Amy Coney Barrett and Ketanji Brown Jackson.</div>

Sackler family members said they would continue to push for a settlement, warning that the alternative was &#34;costly and chaotic legal proceedings in courtrooms across the country&#34;.
&#34;I&#39;m just so grateful to the Supreme Court right now I can&#39;t get beyond that.&#34;
&#34;The Sacklers have not agreed to place anything approaching their full assets on the table for opioid victims, &#34; he wrote.

The preliminary injunctions are a result of lawsuits filed earlier this year by Republican-led states, including Florida, Arkansas and Missouri.
The states argued that the Biden administration was overstepping its authority and trying to find a roundabout way to forgive student debt after the Supreme Court blocked its sweeping plan last year.
Under the SAVE plan, many borrowers pay just 5% of their discretionary income toward their debt each month, and its guidelines state anyone making $32,800 or less has a $0 monthly payment.

That means the Biden administration cannot reduce borrowers’ monthly bills by as much as half starting July 1, as had been scheduled, and it must pause debt forgiveness to SAVE enrollees.
The administration has canceled $5.5 billion in debt for more than 414,000 borrowers through the plan, which opened in August.

                            <div class="summary">Boeing&#39;s crew flight test represents the first time Starliner is carrying people, flying NASA astronauts Butch Wilmore and Suni Williams.
Before launching on June 5, Boeing and NASA planned for Starliner to be in space for nine days.
As of Friday, the Starliner flight has tallied 24 days and counting.
NASA and Boeing say the delay for testing is solely to gather more data about the spacecraft&#39;s performance, in particular its thruster system.
The Starliner crew flight test represents a final major step before NASA certifies Boeing to fly crew on operational, six-month missions.</div>

Instead, the astronauts, Butch Wilmore and Suni Williams, will remain on the station for several weeks longer as NASA and Boeing engineers continue to study misbehaving thrusters on the vehicle.
But don’t call the astronauts stuck or stranded, officials said on Friday.
“We’re not stuck on I.S.S.,” Mark Nappi, the program manager at Boeing for Starliner, said during a news conference on Friday.

About 1,500 workers across Port Talbot and another site at Llanwern intend to strike over Tata’s decision to close its blast furnaces, cutting 2,800 jobs.
The decision has angered politicians and unions, who have argued that the Tata should wait until after next Thursday’s general election, which Labour is predicted to win.
He said that meeting had happened on Friday morning and safety plans were still being discussed with the company.
Vaughan Gething, leader of Welsh Labour, said: “We will not support the closure of both furnaces.</div>

&#34;The Unite campaign is not about selling jobs, it&#39;s about securing the long-term future of steel making in this country for thousands of workers in Port Talbot and South Wales.
The GMB union also voiced its support, saying &#34;Tata must step back from this irreversible decision and safeguard steelmaking assets.
A Tata Steel spokesperson said Unite&#39;s strike announcement was made unilaterally and it is &#34;unfortunately forced to commence legal action to challenge the validity of Unite&#39;s ballot&#34;.
Urgent and good faith negotiations are required to ensure safety on site and avoid a severe and lasting impact on Port Talbot, Wales and the UK.&#34;</div>

However, the company previously said it would not be changing course in Port Talbot, regardless of who wins the general election.
About 2,800 Tata Steel workers will lose their jobs when the company closes both blast furnaces in Port Talbot by the end of September.
A spokesperson for Tata said: &#34;Following the announcement by Unite union to unilaterally call strike action from 8 July, Tata Steel is unfortunately forced to commence legal action to challenge the validity of Unite&#39;s ballot.
However, the decision to walk out indefinitely is an escalation which now potentially threatens the early closure of the UK’s largest steelmaking operation in Port Talbot.</div>
