                            <div class="summary">Tesla’s global sales fell for the second straight quarter despite price cuts and low-interest financing offers, another sign of weakening demand for the company’s products and electric vehicles overall.
For the first half of the year, Tesla sold more than 910,000 vehicles worldwide, handily beating China’s BYD, which sold 726,153.
Tesla also sold over 33,000 more vehicles during the second quarter than it produced, which should reduce the company’s inventory on hand at its stores.
The sales decline came despite Tesla knocking $2,000 off the prices of three of its five models in the US in April.
Caldwell doesn’t see any big catalyst this year that would boost Tesla sales unless gasoline prices spike.</div>

That was far more than most analysts had expected - though still down nearly 5% from the same period in 2023.
Tesla has been navigating a slowdown in demand, as high borrowing costs weigh on buyers and competition increases.
The firm, which announced plans in April to sack more than 10% of its workforce, has seen sales fall in the first half of the year.
But analysts say Tesla needs to freshen its line-up, if it hopes to stop rivals from making inroads.</div>

Biden&#39;s team noted that the money was raised for Team Biden-Harris, which includes the political entities of the Biden campaign, his joint fundraising committees, the Democratic National Committee and dozens of state parties across the country.
The campaign said that &#34;nearly two-thirds [of] June&#39;s raise came from grassroots donors, and of the $38 million raised in the final few days of the month, more than $30 million came from grassroots donations.&#34;
The campaign also said its political operation went into the third quarter with $240 million on hand.
Raskin noted that if Biden announces he will not stand for reelection, the party will be united around someone else.</div>

Democrats are now worried Biden could cost them the Senate and keep them from flipping the House.
Delaware Democrat Sen. Chris Coons, a Biden ally, brushed off the president&#39;s performance, saying Biden still has the support of many in the Democratic Party.
Yes, he spoke plainly, but what he said was lie after lie after lie,&#34; Coons said.
Former House Speaker Nancy Pelosi told CNN Democrats will still retake the House with Biden on the ticket.</div>

Justice Department attorneys and victims&#39; family members and their lawyers spoke for about two hours on Sunday, discussing the plan, lawyers said.
Boeing declined to comment, and it wasn&#39;t immediately clear if it would accept a plea deal.
Under that agreement, Boeing said it would pay $2.5 billion.
The plea deal would require Boeing to pay an additional fine of about $247 million and call for the installation of an outside monitor on Boeing, according to Paul Cassell, one of the lawyers.</div>

Federal officials shared details of the offer on a call with the families on Sunday afternoon before bringing the deal to Boeing, according to the lawyers, Paul G. Cassell and Mark Lindquist.
The terms include a nearly $244 million fine, a new investment in safety improvements, three years of scrutiny from an external monitor, and a meeting between Boeing’s board and the victims’ families, said Mr. Cassell, a University of Utah law professor.

Volkswagen is expected to use Rivian&#39;s electrical architecture and software stack for vehicles beginning in the second half of the decade, Scaringe said during the investment announcement.
He said the joint venture does not include anything with battery technologies, vehicle propulsion platforms, high voltage systems or autonomy and electrical hardware.

Rivian, which was founded in 2009 as Mainstream Motors, had billions in investments by 2021, including from Amazon, BlackRock and Ford.
But as the case with many new electric vehicle companies, Rivian has also experienced hiccups in trying to ramp up to production, made harder by supply chain issues during the pandemic.

A once prolifically successful studio, Pixar has suffered at the box office in the wake of the pandemic.
As a result, before &#34;Inside Out 2,&#34; no Disney animated feature from Pixar or its Walt Disney Animation studio had generated more than $480 million at the global box office since 2019.
&#34;Inside Out 2&#34; has also showcased how vital the family audience is to the box office.</div>

National Energy Action (NEA) has estimated that about 5.6 million households in Great Britain will remain in fuel poverty over the summer, even with lower prices.
This has left European markets more exposed to global energy price fluctuations as it relies more on imports from the US and the Middle East.
Europe’s gas market prices were lower in the early months of the year after a relatively mild winter, allowing energy bills to fall this summer.
has urged households to take a meter reading as close to 30 June as possible “to ensure you don’t pay over the odds for any energy used after the new price cap takes effect”.</div>

Leading consultancy Cornwall Insight predicts that a typical household&#39;s annual bill will be back up to £1,723 in October, a £155, or 10%, increase from now.
However, a typical household&#39;s energy bill remains about £400 higher than three years ago, prompting debate over the issue during the election campaign.
The vast majority of households pay by direct debit, and their payments are smoothed out over the year.

It said it agreed to pay $37.25 a share in Boeing stock for Spirit, giving the plane supplier an equity value of $4.7 billion.

On an annual basis house price growth accelerated from 1.3% in May to 1.5% in June, leaving prices about 3% below the record high set in summer 2022.
The average price of a UK home was £266,064 in June, Nationwide said.
House prices in the UK fell last year as households came under pressure from 14 consecutive interest rate rises from the Bank of England, but they remain at historically high levels relative to earnings.
Prices returned to growth earlier this year, but activity has been constrained by persistently higher borrowing costs and prices remaining unaffordable for many households.</div>

Robert Gardner, Nationwide&#39;s chief economist, said that mortgage rates are &#34;still well above the record lows prevailing in 2021 in the wake of the pandemic&#34;.
Despite some major lenders cutting their mortgage rates last week, home loan costs remain far higher than pre-pandemic levels.

                            <div class="summary">If the Fed cuts rates too soon, Powell cautioned, inflation could re-accelerate, forcing the policymakers to reverse course and impose punishing rate hikes.
Most economists think the Fed’s first rate cut will occur in September, with potentially another cut to follow by year’s end.
The Fed chair also said the job market is “cooling off appropriately,” which likely means that it won’t heighten inflationary pressures through rapid wage gains.
“It doesn’t look like it’s heating up or presenting a big problem for inflation going forward,” Powell said of the job market.
In her remarks Tuesday, though, Lagarde reiterated that the ECB is not on any “predetermined path” and that its recent rate cut “would be followed by further review of data.”Such comments have led many analysts to conclude that the ECB’s next rate cut won’t occur until September at the earliest.</div>

                            <div class="summary">Inflation “now shows signs of resuming its disinflationary trend,” Mr. Powell said on Tuesday at the European Central Bank’s annual conference in Sintra, Portugal.
It was an optimistic message after the Fed’s fight against inflation hit a speed bump earlier this year.
Fed officials have been waiting to see further progress on inflation before they begin to lower interest rates, which are currently set to their highest level in decades, at 5.3 percent.
Mr. Powell declined to say exactly when officials could begin to cut borrowing costs, but suggested that they could lower rates if inflation data continued on its current track or if the labor market weakened.
“What we’d like to see is more data like what we’ve been seeing recently,” Mr. Powell said, later adding, “We have the ability to take our time and get this right.”</div>

                            <div class="summary">Shares of Chewy rose 15% premarket on Monday, before reversing sharply, after a filing showed Keith Gill, the stock influencer known as “Roaring Kitty”, had picked up a 6.6% stake in the pet products e-retailer.
The turbulent rally comes days after the investor, known for triggering the meme-stock rally of 2021, posted an uncaptioned picture of a puppy on the social media platform X that briefly sent Chewy shares to a near one-year high on Thursday.
Chewy reversed all its gains and entered the red shortly after the New York Stock Exchange opened on Monday.
The SEC, Chewy and Gill did not immediately respond to requests for comment.
The filing showed that Gill owns 9m shares of Chewy, equating to a stake worth about $245m at the stock’s Friday closing price of $27.24.</div>

The Chewy stake is Gill&#39;s first known investment beyond GameStop.
Gill sent GameStop shares soaring in 2021 with a series of social media posts that drew a flood of retail money into the company.
They were last down 4.8% at $25.92, with more than 54 million shares trading hands, more than three times 25-day moving average volumes.

Before launching on June 5, Boeing and NASA planned for Starliner to be in space for nine days.
As of Friday, the Starliner flight has tallied 24 days and counting.
NASA and Boeing say the delay for testing is solely to gather more data about the spacecraft&#39;s performance, in particular its thruster system.
The Starliner crew flight test represents a final major step before NASA certifies Boeing to fly crew on operational, six-month missions.</div>

Instead, the astronauts, Butch Wilmore and Suni Williams, will remain on the station for several weeks longer as NASA and Boeing engineers continue to study misbehaving thrusters on the vehicle.
But don’t call the astronauts stuck or stranded, officials said on Friday.
“We’re not stuck on I.S.S.,” Mark Nappi, the program manager at Boeing for Starliner, said during a news conference on Friday.
