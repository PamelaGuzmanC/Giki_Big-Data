CNN —

Remember when Kate Moss wore wellies (that’s rain boots for those outside the UK) to Glastonbury?

As the historic festival once again returns to Worthy Farm, we look back at one of its most memorable fashion moments. After all, no British summer would be complete without copious amounts of mud.

And no one has conquered it quite like Moss.

Some 19 years ago, Britain’s best-known supermodel broke fashion’s proverbial fourth wall and joined the mortals in their muddy squalor. Sure, she’d probably spent the weekend glamping in the festival’s VIP zone. But a filthy field is England’s great leveler – and during those brief, well-photographed walks through the Glastonbury grounds, cigarette in hand, she was just like us.

Until, that is, her choice of practical footwear transformed festival fashion and helped save a heritage boot maker from the brink of obsolescence.

It was the summer of 2005 and Moss was near the height of her powers. Media interest in her festival whereabouts was amplified by a fixation with her then-nascent dalliance with Pete Doherty. But while The Libertines’ frontman certainly looked more at home in the conditions, it was Moss who grabbed the limelight.

Matching a pair of classic black Hunter rain boots with a waistcoat, short shorts and studded belt (and later a glittering tunic), the model was a picture of understated glamor. Below the knee her look was interchangeable with that of a Somerset pig farmer. But above it, she could just have easily emerged from a Chelsea mansion to a well-placed paparazzi ambush.

The images quickly went viral (or as viral as they could in the pre-social media age). The bastion of mid-1990s so-called “heroin chic” had become the face of its slightly older, more respectable cousin: mid-2000s festival chic.

In the process, wellies secured their place in the popular imagination. No longer the preserve of agriculture, they had become a rubbery status symbol best matched with trilby hats, cravats and other questionable noughties accessories. This once-practical boot had morphed into bourgeois badge of honor indicating that the wearer was prepared to “rough it” and still look fabulous (the drug-afflicted rockstar boyfriend remained an optional part of the look).

Suddenly, festival wear became its own category of clothing, something far greater than an amalgam of items you didn’t mind ruining. But an even more profound transformation was also taking place – that of the then-struggling Hunter Boot Limited.

The Scottish brand’s true heyday may have been during the World Wars, when it produced huge quantities of waterproof boots for the front lines. But never before in the company’s then 149-year history had its sensible footwear been so desirable. While one shouldn’t overstate the power of the Moss effect (her endorsement couldn’t save the boot maker from entering administration in 2006), it helped set in motion a remarkable turnaround in the company’s fortunes.

By 2007, the firm was under new ownership and reporting an 85% increase in year-on-year sales. It has since become a bona fide festival fixture, producing rainwear, outerwear and boots in all manner of colors and styles.

Once prized for keeping gangrene at bay in the trenches, Hunter has completed the ultimate 21st-century transformation to become the rainy-day boot de jour for celebrities from Rita Ora to Rihanna, Cara Delevingne to Alexa Chung.

And to think that all Kate wanted was a pair of snug, dry feet.","CNN —Remember when Kate Moss wore wellies (that’s rain boots for those outside the UK) to Glastonbury?

CNN —

The teenage cousin of the gunman responsible for the 2022 Uvalde, Texas, school shooting was arrested Monday on suspicion of threatening to “do the same thing” to a school, according to court documents obtained by CNN.

Nathan James Cruz, 17, was arrested on a felony charge of making a terroristic threat to a public place and a misdemeanor charge of making a terroristic threat against a family member, according to Bexar County Central Magistrate records.

Cruz is the cousin of Salvador Ramos, the 18-year-old who fatally shot 19 children and two teachers at Robb Elementary School in May 2022, San Antonio police Sgt. Washington Moscoso told the New York Times on Monday.

CNN has sought comment from San Antonio police.

Ramos stormed into Robb Elementary last year armed with an assault rifle and tactical vest and opened fire on two adjoining classrooms – perpetrating one of the deadliest school shootings in modern US history. Law enforcement’s response has been heavily scrutinized, as officers waited outside the classrooms for more than an hour before entering and fatally shooting Ramos.

Cruz’s mother contacted police on Monday after her daughter reported that Cruz said he planned to “do the same thing” as his cousin, according to an affidavit obtained by CNN.

His mother told investigators she was “especially concerned because the suspect is currently on probation, was intoxicated at the time” and because the family lives across the street from an elementary school, the affidavit states.

Cruz’s sister told investigators that while she was giving her brother a ride, he “threatened to shoot her in the head and stated he would ‘shoot the school,’” according to the affidavit.

The mother allegedly overheard a phone conversation in which Cruz was attempting to illegally acquire an AR-15-style assault rifle – the same style used by Ramos to carry out the Uvalde shooting, according to the affidavit.

Following his arrest, Cruz “denied making any threats” when interviewed by a detective, the document states.

CNN has been unable to confirm whether Cruz has an attorney. His charges carry a combined $160,000 bond, according to the magistrate records.","Editor’s Note: (6/27/24) Since this story was published in August 2023, the case against Nathan James Cruz was dismissed due to a missing witness, according to court records in Bexar County, Texas.

The decision by the high court, whose six-seat conservative majority includes three members nominated by Trump, will determine the fate of the high-stakes criminal case brought by special counsel Jack Smith.

Trump is charged in a four-count indictment with illegally conspiring to overturn his loss to President Joe Biden in the 2020 presidential election.

According to a regulatory filing on Monday, the resolution to approve the compensation received 339.3 million votes in favor and 404.8 million against at the annual meeting held on Thursday.

The board had urged shareholders to vote in favor of the resolution. But two shareholder advisory firms, Glass Lewis and Institutional Shareholder Services, both recommended that investors vote down the measure.

For the 2024 fiscal year, Benioff received $39.6 million in total pay, up from $29.9 million in the prior year. While Benioff's salary was flat at $1.55 million, he received additional stock and option awards and nonequity incentive plan compensation, according to the proxy statement. The most recent sum also included security fees that had not previously been invoiced to the company.

In January, the board's compensation committee gave Benioff a second long-term equity award worth $20 million, in recognition of the company's ""successful transformation actions and strong financial performance in the fiscal year,"" among other factors.

Glass Lewis wrote in its recommendation that ""shareholders may reasonably be wary of the substantial discretionary equity grants"" issued to Benioff in January, adding that there was a ""lack of a fully convincing rationale"" behind the grants.

Benioff was already among the largest holders of Salesforce, with a stake of over 2% valued at close to $6 billion. Glass Lewis said in its proxy paper that the additional performance-based restricted stock units and stock options were ""unwarranted"" because his interests were already aligned with that of shareholders.

The vote from the annual meeting is nonbinding.

""Our Compensation Committee, which is responsible for designing and administering our executive compensation program, values the opinions expressed by our stockholders and will consider the outcome of this vote when making future executive compensation decisions,"" Salesforce's board said in the company's proxy statement.

The company declined to comment.

Salesforce shares rose 67% in the 2024 fiscal year ended Jan. 31, the strongest performance since 2011.

Net income jumped to $4.1 billion in the fiscal year from $208 million a year earlier, while revenue increased 11% to $34.9 billion from $31.4 billion. In January 2023, Salesforce announced plans to lay off 10% of employees, after activist investors began buying up stakes and demanding a better mix of profit and growth.

Iran is headed for a runoff election on Friday, July 5, that will see an ultra-right wing hardliner compete against a reformist during a time of intense economic, social, and geopolitical challenges for the Middle Eastern country. The runoff will allow all 61 million eligible Iranian voters to cast their ballots after no presidential candidate managed to win a majority when the country initially voted on June 28 in a snap election, following the death of former Iranian President Ebrahim Raisi in a helicopter crash in May. Amid record low voter turnout of around 40% on Friday — the lowest of any presidential election in the Islamic Republic's 45-year existence — two dramatically different candidates came out on top. Reformist candidate Masoud Pezeshkian came out ahead with 10.4 million of 24.5 million votes cast, while hardline former nuclear negotiator Saeed Jalili came out just behind with 9.4 million votes. The two other candidates in Friday's race — Iranian Parliament Speaker Mohammad Bagher Qalibaf and Shiite cleric Mostafa Pourmohammadi — received 3.3 million votes and roughly 206,000 votes, respectively. Two additional candidates of the six approved to run by Iran's ultra-conservative Guardian Council had dropped out of the race on Thursday. All the candidates are seen as deeply conservative and anti-Western except for Pezeshkian.

A former nuclear negotiator, Jalili currently serves as a representative for Iran's Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei on the Supreme National Security Council, known to be the most hardline wing of the regime and its highest security body. Jalili, 58, is one of the furthest-right wing candidates approved to run in the snap election and is a longtime Iranian government insider, but has also had several failed attempts at running for office. Pezeshkian meanwhile, is by far the most moderate of Iran's presidential candidates. He formerly served as minister of health under Iran's last reformist president Mohammad Khatami, from 1997 to 2005, and Khatami among other reformist politicians have endorsed him. The 69-year-old Pezeshkian has also been a parliament member since 2008. He is a member of the Islamic Consultative Assembly and the vice speaker of parliament. He wants to loosen social restrictions like Iran's strict hijab law and improve relations with the West, including potentially re-starting nuclear talks with world powers.

Manhattan is becoming a buyer's market as apartment prices fell and inventory rose in the second quarter of 2024, according to new reports.

The average real estate sales price in Manhattan fell 3% to just more than $2 million, according to a report from Douglas Elliman and Miller Samuel. The median price fell 2% to $1.2 million, and prices for luxury apartments fell for the first time in more than a year, according to the report.

The price declines are a result of rising inventory of apartments for sale, which are also taking longer to sell. There are now more than 8,000 apartments for sale in Manhattan, which is higher than the 10-year average of about 7,000, according to Jonathan Miller, CEO of Miller Samuel, the appraisal and research firm.

Manhattan now has a 9.8 month supply of apartments for sale, which means it would take 9.8 months to sell all of the apartments on the market without any new listings, according to Brown Harris Stevens. ""Any number over 6 months tells us there is too much supply and we are in a buyer's market,"" according to the Brown Harris Stevens report.

The falling prices and rising number of unsold apartments in Manhattan stand in contrast to the national real estate landscape, where continued tight supply continues to keep prices high. Brokers and real estate analysts say the strong prices in Manhattan post-Covid became unsustainable, and both buyers and sellers are finally capitulating to a higher interest rate environment.","Manhattan is becoming a buyer's market as apartment prices fell and inventory rose in the second quarter of 2024, according to new reports.

When including hybrid vehicles, Li Auto remained by far the leader. It delivered 47,774 cars in June, for a first-half total of 188,981 vehicles. Most of the company's cars come with a fuel tank to extend the battery's driving range.

Xpeng remained a laggard, delivering 52,028 cars in total in the first six months of the year, including 10,668 vehicles in June.

That's slightly more than Nio 's 87,426 deliveries for the first six months of 2024, although Nio continued to recover from sluggish performance earlier in the year with a record 21,209 deliveries in June.

BEIJING — Chinese electric car company Zeekr said Monday it delivered a record number of vehicles in June, making its deliveries for the first half of the year the largest among U.S.-listed Chinese companies only selling pure electric cars.

Shares of Zeekr fell by 3.2% in U.S. trading overnight, while Li Auto and Nio both saw shares rise by more than 6%. Xpeng shares rose by nearly 5.2%.

Also offering hybrids, Huawei's jointly developed Aito brand with car manufacturer Seres delivered 184,286 vehicles in the first six months of the year.

Smartphone and home appliance company Xiaomi said it has delivered more than 10,000 cars in June, bringing total deliveries to more than 25,000 since the Hong Kong-listed company launched its electric SU7 in late March.

BYD delivered 1.6 million new energy passenger vehicles in the first half of the year, up nearly 29% from a year ago. Plug-in hybrid cars accounted for a slightly greater share than battery electric vehicles, and saw faster growth at 39.5% versus 17.7% for battery-only cars.

That reflects how much of China's new energy vehicle sales are being driven by hybrid-powered vehicles rather than purely battery-powered ones as range anxiety remains a top concern for consumers in China.

LONDON — There's been one main narrative since the U.K.'s Conservative Prime Minister Rishi Sunak called a general election back in May — that the opposing Labour Party would win the vote with a landslide. While voter polls may have differed in scale and methodology, the results have pointed in one direction, showing that the center-left Labour Party has around a 20-point lead on the Conservatives. Labour is on track to win around 40% of the vote while roughly 20% of the support is projected to go to the Tories, according to a Sky News poll tracker. Reform UK, led by arch-Brexiteer Nigel Farage, is seen with 16% of the vote, after eating away at Tory support, while the Liberal Democrats are seen gaining around 11% and the Greens with 6%. The Scottish National Party is predicted to win 2.9% of the vote. Labour candidates and leader Keir Starmer have been keen to play down the level of support that the party enjoys, fearing voter complacency and the appearance of ""having it in the bag"" — a stance that could prompt voter apathy and a lower turnout of supporters at the polls, or a backlash from Conservative-inclined sections of the electorate. ""The Labour Party wants to be able to be convince voters that it's absolutely central that they turn out and vote, because otherwise the Tories will win, and the Tories are desperate for people to think that they have still got a chance, and therefore it's worth turning up,"" Britain's top polling expert John Curtice told CNBC. Question marks have risen in the past over the accuracy of British voter polls, with previous projections over or underestimating support for various political parties. The errors have often come about because of inadequate sampling or of factors that are harder to control, such as voters being ""shy"" when polled on which party they intended to support.

This year, however, experts tend to agree that the polls show such a swing to Labour that, even if the scale of support were wrong, the overall result would be the same: a convincing win for the opposition party. ""My attitude is [that] a poll should be taken but not inhaled,"" Curtice said wryly. ""The point is, you shouldn't be looking at them to provide you with pinpoint accuracy, they should give you a reasonable indication of the direction of travel."" ""It just so happens that because this is an election in which apparently one party is so far ahead, much as [it was] in 1997, the polls could be quite a bit out — but nobody will notice,"" he noted, referencing the year when the Labour Party won a landslide against the Conservatives, ending the latter party's then 18-year rule.

Labour 'spin'?

The Labour Party itself is understandably keen to downplay the polls, with a spokesperson telling CNBC that the party doesn't comment on projections, ""as they vary and fluctuate."" ""Instead, we're working hard to take our message of change to voters ahead of the only poll that matters, on 4 July,"" the spokesperson stated. On Monday, Keir Starmer said no vote should be taken for granted, asking his supporters to continue campaigning until polls closed on Thursday. ""The fight for change is for you, but change will only happen if you vote for it. That is the message we have to take to every doorstep these last few hours and days until 10 o'clock on Thursday night."" ""Nothing must be taken for granted, every vote has to be earned. The polls don't predict the future, we have to get out there,"" he told campaign supporters in Hitchin.

Labour's former campaign and communications directors, Alastair Campbell, one of the chief strategists behind the rebranding of the party in the 1990s as 'New Labour' ahead of its monumental election win in 1997, told CNBC that he doubts current voter polls. ""I get really worried about about the way that these election debates are now unfolding, virtually everything in the debate at the moment is about these opinion polls,"" he told CNBC two weeks ago. ""Apart from a few postal votes, nobody's voted yet. And I just do not for one second believe that the Conservatives are going to get virtually wiped out, I just don't believe it,"" he said. ""I just think there's something going very, very wrong with these polls, I could be completely wrong, and it's true that Labour have been consistently ahead.

The 2024 National Basketball Association champions are up for sale.

The Boston Celtics' ownership group announced Monday that it plans to sell the team, according to a statement posted to the Celtics' account on social media site X.

The controlling family of the ownership group, Boston Basketball Partners LLC, said it intends to sell all of its shares in the team ""for estate and family planning consideration.""

The sale of a majority stake is expected to be completed by the end of 2024 or early 2025, with the remainder of the sale closing in 2028, according to the statement.

As sports franchise valuations soar, the Celtics could fetch a particularly high price. The team is among the most successful and most widely followed in U.S. professional sports, and won its NBA record 18th championship last month.

This, plus the soaring cost of sports media rights, will likely lead to a valuation close to — if not more than — the record $4 billion price tag the NBA's Phoenix Suns received in 2023, sports consultants said Monday.","A ""Believe in Boston"" flag flies during the duck boat parade celebrating the Boston Celtics' 18th NBA championship.

Millennials are poised to be the wealthiest generation in history, but are they ready to handle the large inflow of money?

A vast $90 trillion wealth transfer over the next 20 years will likely make millennials ""the richest generation in history,"" according to estimates from global real estate consultancy Knight Frank.

It found that the so-called silent generation — those typically born between 1928 to 1945 — and baby boomers — born from 1946 and 1964 — will ""hand over the reins"" to millennials — those born between 1981 and 1996 — when they pass on their assets.

Millennials have been portrayed as lazy and frivolous spenders, more keen to open their purse strings for avocado toasts instead of saving for a house — so just how equipped are they in managing the seismic flow of income?

""The millennials are very ill prepared … they're not as well prepared as the wealth creating generation,"" Salvatore Buscemi, co-founder and managing partner of multi-family office Brahmin Partners told CNBC.

By the time the millennials inherit this wealth, they will be in their 40s and may not have the aptitude for starting their own business or for investing, he elaborated.

""They don't have the skill sets earlier on to be able to do that because they never had to - they were never pushed,"" he said. ""And the problem is - are they going to be motivated later in life to push themselves to acquire these skill sets?"" asked Buscemi, adding that human nature suggests that people are less inclined to pick up new skills as they age.","Millennials are poised to be the wealthiest generation in history, but are they ready to handle the large inflow of money?

Rather than splurging on impulsive purchases, China's young are saving ferociously as the world's second-largest economy remains in the doldrums.

Here are 4 top tips.,"Gen Z is tired of dating apps and would prefer meeting people in real life, but the tech-savvy generation isn't as experienced with navigating romance in person.

Dating apps have been losing their appeal amongst singles in recent years, especially Gen Z, the generation born between 1997 and 2012. Only 26% of 18 to 29-year-olds in the U.S. are using online dating services compared with 61% of 30 to 49-year-olds, according to Statista data from September 2023.

Dating apps are no longer cool to the younger generation because they're hyper-aware that these companies are solely focused on making money rather than building a good user experience, according to Jeff Guenther, a licensed professional counselor for individuals and couples and author of ""Big Dating Energy.""

""It feels like signing up for dating apps makes tech boys and Silicon Valley investors richer,"" Guenther told CNBC Make It in an interview. ""They want to keep us on the app as long as possible so they can make money off of us and not really match us up with somebody so that we delete the app,""

Guenther pointed to the various app features hidden behind paywalls, and users experiencing frequent ""micro-rejections"" like ghosting which keeps them hooked.

""There's all these like little micro rejections that are happening that mess with your self-esteem, self-worth, mental health so it feels like it's not the best place to feel good about yourself anymore,"" he said.

At least 95% of Gen Z using the dating app Hinge are fearful of rejection and over half say worrying about rejection has held them back from pursuing potential relationships, according to Hinge's dating trends report published in February 2024.

As a result, Gen Z wants to ditch the apps, including going back to traditional methods of dating such as meeting someone in real life, according to a recent Eventbrite survey of 1,001 respondents in the U.S.

Almost half of Gen Zers are keen to meet life partners through their mutual friends and about a third are hopeful that it will happen in their day-to-day routine, Eventbrite found.

""They grew up with iPhones in their hands and they're such digital natives, they probably haven't had too much practice flirting with people in real life and taking risks and it's scary. It's a vulnerable thing to be in real life and go up and approach somebody or ask somebody on a date,"" Guenther said.

Guenther and Courtney Boyer, a relationship and sexuality expert, shared four top tips for Gen Z to meet people in real life.","Gen Z is tired of dating apps and would prefer meeting people in real life, but the tech-savvy generation isn't as experienced with navigating romance in person.

""In every use of official power, the President is now a king above the law,"" Sotomayor wrote. ""This majority's project will have disastrous consequences for the Presidency and for our democracy.""

Jackson echoed her warning: ""If the structural consequences of today's paradigm shift mark a step in the wrong direction, then the practical consequences are a five-alarm fire that threatens to consume democratic self-governance and the normal operations of our Government.""

As written opinions go, the dissenters' alarm was ""definitely striking,"" said Alison LaCroix, a legal historian at the University of Chicago.

""It's a darker tone. It's more of a warning,"" LaCroix told CNBC in an interview about the three dissents, written by the only three justices nominated to the court by Democratic presidents.

In a 6-3 opinion along partisan lines, the Supreme Court on Monday ruled presidents are immune from criminal prosecution on a case-by-case basis, that they are exempt when charges relate to ""official"" presidential acts and not exempt from charges of ""unofficial"" acts.

The immediate effect was to send special counsel Jack Smith's criminal election fraud case against Trump back to U.S. District Judge Tanya Chutkan. She will have to rule on whether the criminal charges pertain to official acts Trump carried out as president, granting him immunity, or his private conduct.

The added complexity will almost certainly delay the trial until after the Nov. 5 election, a victory for Trump, the presumptive nominee, and the Republicans.","Supreme Court Justices Sonia Sotomayor, Ketanji Brown Jackson and Elena Kagan laid out grim visions of U.S. democracy in their joint written dissents to the court's Monday decision on former President Donald Trump's claim of presidential immunity from criminal prosecution.

A bitcoin exchange that collapsed 10 years ago after being hacked is set to return billions of dollars' worth of the token to users — and it has investors worried. In a few days, bankrupt Tokyo-based bitcoin exchange Mt. Gox will begin paying back thousands of users almost $9 billion worth of tokens. The platform went under in 2014 following a series of heists that cost it in the range of 650,000 to 950,000 bitcoin, or upward of $58 billion, at current prices. The payout follows a protracted bankruptcy process that's involved multiple delays and legal challenges. On Monday, the court-appointed trustee overseeing the exchange's bankruptcy proceedings said distributions to the firm's roughly 20,000 creditors would begin in early July. Disbursements will be in a mix of bitcoin and bitcoin cash, an early offshoot of the original cryptocurrency. While this is good news for victims of the hack who have spent years waiting to be made whole, the price of bitcoin slid to $59,000 last week, in the crypto market's second-worst weekly decline of the year.

CNBC spoke to half a dozen analysts to get their take on what to expect when roughly 141,000 bitcoin — or roughly 0.7% of the total 19.7 million bitcoins outstanding — are returned to Mt. Gox victims this week.

Pressure on bitcoin could pick up

Mt. Gox — short for ""Magic: The Gathering Online Exchange"" — was once the largest spot bitcoin exchange globally, claiming to handle around 80% of all global dollar trades for bitcoin. When it shuttered in February 2014, bitcoin was worth around $600. Today, the world's largest cryptocurrency is trading at about $61,000 per coin. That means users opting to be reimbursed in-kind — that is, in the cryptocurrency itself, rather than the cash equivalent — have seen the value of their coins surge over 10,000% in the last decade. John Glover, chief investment officer of crypto lending firm Ledn, told CNBC the windfall for Mt. Gox users would likely translate to huge sales in bitcoin as investors look to lock in gains. ""Many will clearly cash out and enjoy the fact that having their assets stuck in the Mt. Gox bankruptcy was the best investment they ever made,"" said Glover, who was previously a managing director at Barclays. ""Some will clearly choose to take the money and run,"" added Glover. James Butterfill, head of research at CoinShares told CNBC the overhang of the nearly $9 billion of bitcoin set to be released has ""long been a concern for those with bullish views on bitcoin."" ""Consequently, the market is highly sensitive to any related news. With the announcement that the Trust will begin selling in July, investors are understandably worried,"" said Butterfill.

It wouldn't be the first time bitcoin's moved in reaction to big redemptions of funds locked up in centralized trading platforms. Last month, crypto exchange Gemini returned more than $2 billion worth of bitcoin to users with funds that had been trapped in its Earn lending program, marking a 230% recovery after bitcoin prices more than tripled since Gemini suspended Earn withdrawals on Nov. 16. JPMorgan analysts linked this to negative price action, saying in a research note last week that it's ""fair to assume that some of Gemini creditors, which are mostly retail customers, have taken at least partial profits in recent weeks."" Similarly, JPMorgan analysts expect Mt. Gox customers to be similarly inclined to sell some of their bitcoin to profit from seismic gains for the cryptocurrency. ""Assuming most of the liquidations by Mt. Gox creditors take place in July, [this] creates a trajectory where crypto prices come under further pressure in July, but start rebounding from August onwards,"" they wrote. Separately last month, the German government sold 5,000 — worth approximately $305.8 million as of Thursday's prices — of a 50,000-bitcoin pile seized in connection with the movie piracy operation Movi2k. The funds were sent to various crypto exchanges, including Coinbase, Kraken, and Bitstamp, according to blockchain intelligence firm Arkham Intelligence. Analysts say these crypto liquidations, too, have placed pressure on bitcoin's price.

Mt. Gox customers expected to hang on to their bitcoin

Most analysts agree losses in bitcoin are likely to be contained and short-lived. ""I think that sell-off concerns relating to Mt. Gox will likely be short-term,"" said Lennix Lai, chief commercial officer of crypto exchange OKX. ""Many of Mt. Gox's early users as well as creditors are long-term bitcoin enthusiasts who are less likely to sell all of their bitcoin immediately,"" he said, adding previous sell-offs by law enforcement, including the Silk Road case, did not result in a sustained catastrophic price drop. Butterfill suggested there's enough market liquidity to cushion the blow of any possible mass market sell action. ""Bitcoin has maintained a daily trading volume of $8.74 billion on trusted exchanges this year, suggesting that liquidity is sufficient to absorb these sales over the summer months,"" said Butterfill. According to CCData research analyst, Jacob Joseph, the markets are more than capable of absorbing the selling pressure. ""Moreover, a healthy part of the creditors are likely to take a 10% haircut on their holdings to receive the repayment early, and not all holdings are set to be liquidated on the open market, reducing the overall selling pressure,"" he said.

Recent price moves suggest the temporary impact of the Mt. Gox repayments may already be priced in, Joseph added. Galaxy Digital's head of research, Alex Thorn, believes fewer coins will be distributed than people think, meaning there will be less sell pressure than the market expects. However, he also wrote in May that, even if only 10% of the bitcoin distributed is sold, ""it will have a market impact."" ""Most of the individual creditors will have their coins deposited directly into a trading account at an exchange, making it extremely easy to sell,"" Thorn said. Vijay Ayyar, head of consumer growth for Asia-Pacific at crypto exchange Gemini, said that the overall impact of the Mt. Gox disbursement is likely to be ""dissipated,"" given the recipients of the funds are varied. On the one hand, there are individual holders who will get their bitcoin straight away. Then there's the ""significant amount"" of bitcoin that will be disbursed out to claims funds, Ayyar said. ""Those funds would then need to distribute these out to their LPs [limited partners], hence the whole process could take a while adding a time element to the impact on price,"" he told CNBC.

Macro headwinds behind bitcoin's fall

It's worth noting there are plenty of other reasons behind bitcoin's recent declines. The cryptocurrency had a stunning rally earlier this year, climbing past $70,000 on the heels of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission's approval of the first spot bitcoin ETF.

Stock Chart Icon Stock chart icon Bitcoin's U.S. dollar price performance, year-to-date.

But investors have remained anxious amid outflows from bitcoin ETFs and sizable market liquidations. The broader macro environment, too, has investors worried. Earlier this month, the Federal Reserve suggested it plans to cut rates just once this year, down from the multiple cuts it had indicated previously. Cryptocurrencies, which are inherently volatile, are particularly sensitive to changes in the interest rate environment. CoinShares' Butterfill said the Fed's new rate forecast was among ""the likely culprits for the recent price decline"" in bitcoin. This, along with other issues, is ""likely to weigh on prices in the lower volume summer months,"" Butterfill said. However, ""the fundamental investment case remains very much intact,"" he added.","In a few days, bankrupt Tokyo-based bitcoin exchange Mt.

If it reaches a deal, it may kick off a new wave of streaming partnerships that could put the entire media industry on firmer footing.

Paramount Global leadership is having active discussions with other media and tech company executives to determine if a structure makes sense for both parties where Paramount+ can be merged with another streaming entity and potentially co-owned, according to people familiar with the matter, who asked not to be named because the discussions are private.

One of the companies that has expressed a desire to reach a deal is Warner Bros. Discovery , according to people familiar with the matter. Combining Max and Paramount+ could strengthen both services by allowing them to better compete with Netflix and Disney's suite of platforms (Disney+, Hulu and ESPN) for eyeballs and future content.

Warner Bros. Discovery held preliminary merger talks for a deal for all of Paramount Global earlier this year, but talks didn't escalate.

Paramount Global is also considering partnering with a technology platform, the company's co-CEO Chris McCarthy said at an employee town hall on June 25.

""What they don't have is our scale of content, and together we will make for a very powerful combination to drive more minutes and greater profits,"" McCarthy said of a potential tech partner at the town hall, according to a transcript of the event obtained by CNBC.

A merged streaming service would mitigate churn by giving customers more diverse programming and fewer reasons to cancel each month, and it could take Paramount+ losses off Paramount Global's balance sheet by giving it new ownership.

While a structure for a hypothetical joint venture with Warner Bros. Discovery hasn't been discussed in detail, ownership likely wouldn't be a 50-50 split given the existing natures of the streaming assets and their finances, according to people familiar with the discussions.

Warner Bros. Discovery's direct-to-consumer business made $103 million in annual adjusted EBITDA in 2023 after losing $2.1 billion the year before. Paramount Global reported a loss of $1.67 billion in direct-to-consumer operating income before depreciation and amortization in 2023, narrower than its $1.8 billion loss a year prior.

Max has about 100 million global subscribers, with 52.7 million based in the U.S. Paramount+ ended its first quarter with 71 million subscribers.

Comcast's NBCUniversal has also expressed interest in a joint venture with Paramount+, as The Wall Street Journal first reported earlier this year. The talks didn't progress and never got particularly far, according to people familiar with the matter.

""The sheer volume of hit content that we could offer together would be tremendous across TV, film and sports, and would attract millions of viewers,"" McCarthy said during the town hall in reference to a potential partnership with an existing subscription streaming service like Max or Peacock. ""Plus, we would share in all other non-content expenses.""

Top heavy : Stocks were on pace for a higher close Monday in what has been a volatile session for both equities and bonds. The 10-year Treasury yield was once again nearing 4.5%. Picking up where the second quarter left off, the mega tech stocks continued doing the heavy lifting for the S & P 500 , with Club names Apple up more than 2.5%, Amazon up over 2%, and Microsoft up roughly 1.5%. The average stock, however, was having a rougher time, as indicated by the S & P 500 Equal Weight index , which was down nearly 1% on the session. Monday was the start of the third quarter on Wall Street, with hopes for the kind of strength the market saw in the first half of 2024. Downgrade : We're dropping Estee Lauder to our 2 rating from a buy-equivalent 1 rating and lowering our price target to $140 per share from $162. That PT is slightly below the current consensus of $148, following a string of negative data points toward the end of last week. First, it was the Nike earnings call, which was downbeat on China. Management said its quarterly results fell below plan there when excluding a timing benefit. Nike lowered its outlook for Greater China — pointing to a highly promotional environment. Then there was a negative update last Friday from L'Oreal CEO Nicolas Hieronimus at a JPMorgan investor event. Globally, the CEO said the beauty market is growing somewhere between 4.5% to 5%, which is slightly lower than previous expectations. The key reason behind the sluggishness is the lack of growth in China's beauty market, which Hieronimus called ""quite gloomy right now"" with the rebound not materializing. EL YTD mountain Estee Lauder YTD You could argue points: (1) that a lot of this downside could already be priced into Estee Lauder stock down at these low levels and (2) that it is a special situation since the company has said it has moved past its inventory glut and has a profit recovery plan in place to improve margins. We previously thought these two factors would be sufficient for the stock to find its footing. But disappointingly, it has not materialized as expected. If the latest signs point to a Chinese market that is still struggling to recover, then we need to hold off from adding until we see more evidence of this turnaround taking shape. Up next : There are no major earnings reports Monday after the close. But it is jobs week, and the deluge of data kicks off with the government's Job Openings and Labor Turnover Survey (JOLTS) on Tuesday and finishes with the Labor Department's monthly employment report on Friday.

CNBC,https://www.cnbc.com/2024/07/02/japanese-airlines-issue-policies-on-customer-harrassment-and-abuse.html,2024-07-02,00:50:19 UTC,Enough is enough: Japanese airlines clamp down on abusive travelers,"Japan's two largest commercial airlines are toughening their stances against travelers who verbally or physically abuse airline staff.

Japan Airlines and All Nippon Airways updated their websites Friday with ""customer harassment"" policies, in the wake of rising instances of front-line worker abuse occurring across industries in Japan.

Using similarly worded language, the two airlines cited nine behaviors that constitute ""harassment"" under the policies, including:

Abusive language, aggressive tone, insults, discrimination, slander Threatening words or actions Excessive or unreasonable demands Assault Deeds which disrupt business operations (prolonged detention, excessive repetition of requests or complaints) Unpermitted entry to workplace Deeds which deceive its employees Slander against the company or its employees on social media and the internet Sexual harassment

ANA's customer harassment policy also includes voyeurism, stalking and indecent behavior — a jarring reminder of the situations that airline employees can face in an industry that often sees travelers behaving at their worst.

The policies are meant to address a lack of clear standards which has made it difficult for employees to handle customer interactions, ANA's Yoshiko Miyashita, vice president of CS promotion, customer experience management told Nikkei Asia.

""This has placed a significant burden on our employees, leading to cases where some have been forced to take leave,"" she said.

Japan Airlines' policy also mandates airline staff to undergo harassment training — employees will be provided manuals detailing how to quickly and appropriately respond to ""malicious"" behavior.

""We have also established aftercare support for our staff's physical and mental health,"" according to the airline.

Both airlines' policies state that travelers who harass employers will be issued a warning, after which consequences can include denial of boarding and police involvement.","Japan's two largest commercial airlines are toughening their stances against travelers who verbally or physically abuse airline staff.

CNBC,https://www.cnbc.com/2024/07/01/ken-griffin-says-hes-not-convinced-ai-will-replace-human-jobs-in-near-future.html,2024-07-01,19:43:08 UTC,Citadel’s Ken Griffin says he's not convinced that AI will replace human jobs in the near future,"Ken Griffin, founder and CEO of Citadel, said he remains skeptical that artificial intelligence could soon make human jobs obsolete as he sees flaws in machine learning models applied in certain scenarios.

""We are at what is widely viewed as a real inflection point in the evolution of technology, with the rise of large language models. Some are convinced that within three years almost everything we do as humans will be done in one form or another by LLMs and other AI tools,"" Griffin said Friday during an event for Citadel's new class of interns in New York. ""For a number of reasons, I am not convinced that these models will achieve that type of breakthrough in the near future.""

The rapid rise of AI has had the world pondering its far-reaching impact on society, including technology-induced job cuts. Elon Musk, CEO of Tesla, is among many who have repeatedly warned of the threats that AI poses to humanity. He has called AI ""more dangerous"" than nuclear weapons, saying there will come a point where ""no job is needed.""

Griffin, whose hedge fund and electronic market maker have been at the forefront of automation, said machine-learning tools do have their limits when it comes to adapting to changes.

""Machine learning models do not do well in a world where regimes shift. Self-driving cars don't work very well in the North due to snow. When the terrain changes, they have no idea what to do,"" Griffin said. ""Machine learning models do much better when there's consistency.""

Still, the billionaire investor thinks the power of advanced technology can't be dismissed in the long term, and he even sees cancer being eradicated one day because of it.

""The rise of computing power is allowing us to solve all kinds of problems that were just simply not solvable five, 10, 15 years ago,"" Griffin said. ""This is going to radically transform healthcare. We will end cancer as you know it in your lifetime.""

Citadel has long placed a great emphasis on hiring, not hesitant about putting responsibility into the hands of young employees and even interns, the CEO said.

The firm's internship program has become one of the most competitive in the country. More than 85,000 students applied for about 300 positions this year, reflecting an acceptance rate of less than 0.5%, which is lower than that of Harvard University and the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.

""The people we hire today are going to be the leaders of Citadel not in 30 or 40 years, but in just a few years,"" Griffin said.","Ken Griffin, founder and CEO of Citadel, said he remains skeptical that artificial intelligence could soon make human jobs obsolete as he sees flaws in machine learning models applied in certain scenarios.

Here's why that worries financial experts,"Some people could find themselves wrangling with summer travel bills well after Labor Day.

To that point, 36% of Americans said they plan to take on debt in order to travel this summer, according to a March survey from Bankrate. The payment methods for summer travel expenses ranged from personal loans (5%) and buy now, pay later services (8%) to borrowing from family and friends (6%).

Additionally, 26% of summer travelers said they intend to use a credit card and pay over for the vacation over multiple billing cycles.

""The reason that's worrisome is because the average credit card charges more than 20%, which is close to a record high,"" said Ted Rossman, a senior credit card industry analyst at Bankrate.

CNBC,https://www.cnbc.com/2024/07/01/donald-trump-crypto-take-aim-at-sec-as-biden-allies-raise-alarms.html,2024-07-02,00:29:55 UTC,Crypto takes its fight with SEC directly to Biden and Trump,"Former U.S. President and Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump looks on during his campaign event, in Racine, Wisconsin, U.S. June 18, 2024.

On a cool, sunny June evening in San Francisco, the Pacific Heights mansion of venture capitalist David Sacks was the scene of an event that is rare to see in one of America's most progressive cities: a high-dollar, Republican political fundraiser.

The guest of honor on this night was former President Donald Trump, who delivered formal remarks from a curtained stage to guests who had paid up to $300,000 to be there.

The presumptive Republican presidential nominee promised to loosen the regulation of cryptocurrencies if he is elected in November, and to ""get out of the way of innovation,"" a person who was in the room told CNBC. When he was finished, Trump invited the audience members to pipe up.

Stuart Alderoty, chief legal officer of the blockchain giant Ripple, explained the company had spent over $100 million defending itself in litigation brought by the Securities and Exchange Commission.

Alderoty's comment was meant as a example of how the SEC's regulatory actions under Chair Gary Gensler had hampered his company and the industry at large, according to a guest and a person familiar with the situation, who were granted anonymity to describe a private meeting.

As Alderoty spoke, a second crypto executive whose company is also fighting the SEC was in the audience: Paul Grewal, the chief legal officer of Coinbase .

In 2020, before President Joe Biden took office, the SEC accused Ripple and its founders of violating securities laws by acting as unregistered brokers of digital currency tokens, which the SEC regulates as securities. In 2023, the regulator filed a similar complaint against Coinbase, the largest U.S. crypto exchange platform.

The cases are ongoing, and both firms have denied they broke securities laws. Alderoty's comments at the Trump fundraiser have not been previously reported, but he has made similar remarks elsewhere.

This frustration with Gensler's regulatory agenda has taken on a political tenor this year, as crypto investors seek to exert more influence in Washington, D.C.

Trump has seized on this frustration in recent months, recasting himself from a crypto skeptic into a crypto supporter. Early signs show that shift is winning Trump support in the small but loud crypto community.

Some in the industry who are siding with Trump are going farther than just complaining about Gensler. Instead, they're trying to shape the agency in a potential future Trump administration — starting at the top.

In recent weeks, crypto investors have raised several names of potential nominees for SEC commissioner, in the event that Trump is elected to a second term, according to three people who have knowledge of the conversations.

These names include two former chairs of the Commodity Futures Trading Commission during the Trump administration: J. Christopher Giancarlo and Heath Tarbert.","Former U.S. President and Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump looks on during his campaign event, in Racine, Wisconsin, U.S. June 18, 2024.

CNBC,https://www.cnbc.com/2024/07/01/inside-starbucks-plans-to-improve-stores.html,2024-07-01,21:19:38 UTC,Inside Starbucks' plans to improve stores for customers and baristas,"watch now

Starbucks cafes across the country are starting to change how they make drink orders, among other tweaks designed to reduce bottlenecks and long wait times that have dogged the chain. The overhaul comes as the coffee giant prepares for an anticipated swell of orders through its mobile app. At the heart of the plan is Starbucks' ""Siren Craft System,"" a series of processes that are aimed at making baristas' jobs easier and speeding up service times for customers. Starbucks said more than 10% of its 10,000 stores have already implemented the system, which includes changing the production order for hot and cold drinks. It will be in use across North America by the end of July, according to the company. Executives hope the changes will provide a much-needed jolt to Starbucks. In April, the company reported a disappointing second quarter, as U.S. same-store sales fell 3% and traffic dropped 7%. The coffee chain cut its 2024 outlook. Starbucks reported rates of incomplete mobile app orders in the mid-teens and said occasional customers came in less. CEO Laxman Narasimhan mentioned the need to make improvements to stores. Katie Young, senior vice president of store operations at Starbucks, said the most immediate shift that needed to happen in cafes was better handling the unexpected. ""It's the ability to flexibly respond to things we cannot predict,"" she told CNBC in an interview.

The store changes will be key this month, as Starbucks on Monday started opening up its app to non-rewards members, which the company believes will increase traffic and orders. Analyst Peter Saleh, managing director at BTIG, said, ""My sense is that they have a lot of demand in certain stores, and the footprint of the kitchen is so small, you have to find ways to be more efficient."" Losing customers because of slow orders and other store frustrations could cost Starbucks at a particularly vulnerable time. Americans have become cost conscious in the face of ongoing inflation, and in some cases have pulled back on morning or afternoon beverages and snacks. Narasimhan in April said consumers are spending more cautiously. Starbucks has done something uncharacteristic in recent weeks, joining the stream of value offerings with a $5 food and beverage combo option. Communicating value to customers is also part of the plan to drum up business.

The Siren system

Starbucks has been diagnosing the bottleneck issue for more than a year, since the company's reinvention plan rollout in 2022, said Young. At the time, Howard Schultz was at the helm, having returned during a burgeoning unionization movement and shifts in consumer preferences. The changes underway in cafes were first previewed that fall, to be rolled out in the years to come. Narasimhan took over for Schultz in March 2023. The Siren system processes were developed with worker feedback on which issues stopped them from creating beverages and connecting with customers. Starbucks said it plans to add a role akin to an expediter in a restaurant production line, a ""play caller"" who steps away from production and helps solve logjams in cafes, handling tasks such as restocking cups or helping when an unexpected crowd arrives. The company plans to train existing workers for the role or potentially add new baristas, if needed. ""One of the pain points we saw was [that] our espresso machine was often running all the time, and that was one of the things that kept our partners from being able to check in. And another thing we saw that you didn't necessarily know was which part of the store would get crowded,"" Young said. ""We needed to actually have a partner that was dedicated when things got busy to pulling out of production and just helping."" Starbucks said it will also change the order in which beverages are made. Previously, cold drinks were prioritized from start to finish, even if a hot beverage order came in first, as pulling espresso shots was the last step. This could create a traffic jam in the drive-thru, for example, if a person ordered one of each beverage, as the cold item would be ready while the hot drink was still in production. Macoy McLaughlin, manager of Seattle's First and Walker Starbucks location, said producing beverages in the order they were placed allows for a faster, streamlined process. ""We actually have proper sequencing between our hot and cold bars, versus cold bars becoming as popular as ever, to really have a consistent experience for the customers. So we're actually making them in the order they're coming in,"" McLaughlin said, adding that the cafe feels busier, but customers in store and in the drive-thru are getting drinks faster. Baristas also will have more control over the company's digital production manager, an iPad system that controls the sequencing of orders in various channels from cafes, mobile orders and the drive-thru, the company said. Workers will have more flexibility over changing order priority.

CNBC,https://www.cnbc.com/2024/07/01/chewy-shares-rally-20percent-after-sec-filing-reveals-roaring-kitty-keith-gill-has-6point6percent-stake.html,2024-07-01,12:58:18 UTC,Chewy shares rally more than 10% after SEC filing reveals ‘Roaring Kitty’ Keith Gill has 6.6% stake,"The filing showed Roaring Kitty, whose legal name is Keith Gill, bought just over 9 million shares — amounting to a 6.6% stake in the company. That makes him the third-biggest Chewy shareholder, according to FactSet. Based on Friday's close, that stake is valued at more than $245 million.

Shares of Chewy popped in premarket trading Monday after a Securities and Exchange Commission filing showed meme stock trader ""Roaring Kitty"" took a stake in the pet food e-commerce retailer.

The SEC filing also included a section that read: ""Check the appropriate box to designate whether you are a cat."" There was an ""x"" next to a response that read: ""I am not a cat."" This line was included in Gill's statement in a series of congressional hearings about 2021's GameStop trading mania.

The stock was up more than 10% before the bell.

Chewy shares took a wild ride last week after Gill posted a picture on social media platform X of a cartoon dog that resembled Chewy's logo. Shares were up as much as 34% on Thursday but ended the day down slightly.

CNBC emailed Chewy PR seeking comment on the new shareholder.

Gill is known to be a champion of GameStop and has been stirring up trading in the video game company in the last few months. In mid-June, he disclosed a stake of 9.001 million GameStop shares after exiting his massive call options position. It's unclear if he sold his GameStop bet to fund the purchase of Chewy.

GameStop shares fell over 7% in premarket Monday following the news.



There's a big connection between GameStop and Chewy. GameStop CEO Ryan Cohen was the founder and CEO of Chewy, who was instrumental in PetSmart's takeover of Chewy in 2017 and its subsequent initial public offering in 2019.

Cohen joined the GameStop board of directors along with two other Chewy executives in January 2021, partly helping fuel the initial GameStop rally. He later took over as GameStop CEO in 2023, leading a turnaround in the brick-and-mortar video game retailer.

In a recent YouTube livestream, Gill said GameStop is in the second stage of a reinvention, and it has become a bet on Cohen himself, who's been leading a turnaround and pivot to e-commerce.

Gill is a former marketer for Massachusetts Mutual Life Insurance. He came into the limelight after successfully encouraging retail investors to buy GameStop shares and call options in 2021 to squeeze out short-selling hedge funds.","The filing showed Roaring Kitty, whose legal name is Keith Gill, bought just over 9 million shares — amounting to a 6.6% stake in the company.

Although the unemployment rate has spent 30 months at or below below 4% — a near record — not everyone who wants a job has one. And not everyone even wants a job at all. Some, referred to as ""NEETs,"" which stands for ""not in employment, education, or training,"" are opting out of the labor force largely because they are discouraged by their economic standing. Others, alternatively, are well-qualified but often younger candidates who are struggling to find positions, comprising a contingent of ""new unemployables,"" according to a recent report by Korn Ferry.

Among 16- to 24-year-olds, the unemployment rate rose to 9% in May, which is ""typical,"" according to Alí Bustamante, a labor economist and director of the Worker Power and Economic Security program at the Roosevelt Institute, a liberal think tank based in New York City. Although the youth unemployment rate fell below 7% in 2023, according to the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics, such lows were ""emblematic of how hot the labor market was at that point,"" Bustamante said. ""9% is basically what we should be expecting during relatively good economic times for younger workers,"" he added.

'NEETS' feel 'left out and left behind'

Still, some young adults in the U.S. are neither working nor learning new skills. In 2023, about 11.2% of young adults ages 15 to 24 in the U.S. were considered as NEETs, according to the International Labour Organization. In other words, roughly one in 10 young people are ""being left out and left behind in many ways,"" Bustamante said. Even though ""that's typically the norm,"" he said, ""we should be expecting these rates to be lower."" More from Personal Finance:

The 'funflation' effect: Why consumers are spending this summer Young men, especially, are increasingly disengaged, according to Julia Pollak, a labor economist at ZipRecruiter. ""The NEET trend is mostly a male phenomenon,"" she said. Pollak explained that's in part due to declining opportunities in traditionally male occupations, such as construction and manufacturing, while ""women's enrollment in schooling, education outcomes, and employment outcomes have mostly trended upwards.""

'Talent hoarding' has led to 'new unemployables'

According to Korn Ferry's report, a ""perfect storm"" has also created a glut of ""new unemployables,"" or highly trained workers who struggle to find job opportunities. ""Employers are holding on to the talent they have and increasingly focusing on talent mobility,"" said David Ellis, senior vice president for global talent acquisition transformation at Korn Ferry. This ""talent hoarding"" has led to fewer available job openings even for well-qualified candidates, he said.

At the same time, firms are scaling back on new hires, limiting the opportunities at the entry level, as well. While the teen employment rate is the highest it has been in over a decade, early 20-somethings are struggling to find jobs, Pollak said. ""It's the 20- to 24-year-olds that saw a massive drop off in the labor force participation during the pandemic, and who have lagged behind ever since."" Overall, hiring projections for the class of 2024 fell 5.8% from last year, according to a report from the National Association of Colleges and Employers, or NACE. As more candidates compete for fewer positions, stretches of unemployment are also lengthening. Now, the number of people unemployed for longer than six months is up 21%, Korn Ferry found.

Mandatory yearly reporting will phase in starting in 2026, with digital currency brokers required to cover gross proceeds from sales in 2025 via Form 1099-DA. In 2027, brokers must include cost basis, or purchase price, for certain digital asset sales for 2026.

""These regulations are an important part of the larger effort on high-income individual tax compliance,"" IRS Commissioner Danny Werfel said in a statement. ""We need to make sure digital assets are not used to hide taxable income, and these final regulations will improve detection of noncompliance in the high-risk space of digital assets.""

""Everybody's been waiting for the tidal wave of this enforcement activity,"" James Creech, an attorney and senior manager at accounting firm Baker Tilly, previously told CNBC.","The U.S. Department of the Treasury and IRS on Friday released final tax reporting rules for digital asset brokers — and crypto investors have limited time to prepare, experts say.
Mandatory yearly reporting will phase in starting in 2026, with digital currency brokers required to cover gross proceeds from sales in 2025 via Form 1099-DA.
In 2027, brokers must include cost basis, or purchase price, for certain digital asset sales for 2026.
""These regulations are an important part of the larger effort on high-income individual tax compliance,"" IRS Commissioner Danny Werfel said in a statement.

Currently, they both work full-time jobs, but Amanda would like to stop working for a few years to spend time at home raising their daughters before they go to school. Carlos is supportive, but thinks her income is imperative to their overall financial picture. The couple lives comfortably outside the New York metropolitan area with their two daughters. Together, they earn around $180,000 a year, they told self-made millionaire and money expert Ramit Sethi on a recent episode of his ""I Will Teach You to be Rich"" podcast. The couple's last names were not used. Carlos has a government job and hopes to retire relatively soon when he hits the 20-year mark and gets his pension. Amanda is a teacher who only recently went back to work after taking a break to have their daughters. They pay $1,881 a month for day care, and Amanda earns a net income of about $44,870 a year, or about $3,739 a month, meaning over half of her take-home pay goes toward child care. The couple keeps their finances separate, with Amanda covering child care while Carlos pays for other costs, like rent. But after crunching the numbers with Sethi on the podcast, they realized they could reasonably afford for Amanda to leave her job. In addition to reducing their child-care costs to $0, the couple estimates they could cut out an entire car payment, along with some fuel costs, if Amanda was able to stay home. Plus, they'd save on food because she would be able to cook rather than use the meal prep service they currently pay for. But day-to-day costs aren't the only thing to consider when weighing whether a parent should take a break from the workforce to care for their children. Here's why.

The burden often falls on women

The cost of external child care has risen by roughly 263% from 1990 to 2024, according to a KPMG analysis. With that in mind, it may seem like the logical choice to have the lower-earning parent stay home if their salary is comparable to the annual cost of child care. But in many opposite-sex couples that parent is the mother, since men earn more than women, both historically and statistically. And for some women, it's less of a choice and more of an expectation that, when applicable, the stay-at-home parent will be the mother. While the share of stay-at-home parents who are fathers has been on the rise over the last few decades, mothers remain the majority (82%) of stay-at-home parents, according to Pew Research. ""I have seen many women leave their jobs because their salaries don't cover the cost of childcare,"" Emily Green, head of wealth management for Ellevest, told CNBC Make It in an email. ""In some households, that math means a career break is inescapable."" But even when a family has the option to decide between paying for child care or having one parent stay home, there are more costs to consider. ""In households where there's a little more financial wiggle room, women often don't think about what they may give up in the long term — say in 5-10 years — by leaving their jobs now,"" Green said.

Costs of leaving the workforce

Green shared three examples of how taking a break from the workforce can have long-term effects on an individual's — and their family's — financial future. 1. Steady salary increases Salaried workers can generally expect to see their income rise over time, even if it's a modest 2% to 3% each year. If you stop working, no matter the reason, you miss out on those annual raises, Green says. ""If they are out of the workforce for 5 or 10 years, then return to the job market, they don't get that benefit of steady salary increases,"" Green said. ""It is likely women will start back up from where they stopped."" While a career break can impact any worker's salary trajectory, it's especially challenging for women who see the gender pay gap widen when they become parents. Mothers earned 31% less than fathers in 2023, according to a Bankrate analysis of the Census Bureau's Current Population Survey data. 2. Resume gaps While career breaks may be becoming more acceptable, many companies still see gaps on your resume as a red flag when looking to hire someone, Green said. ""You may be highly educated with a large amount of experience in your field before you left to take care of your kids,"" she wrote. ""The corporate world still sees gaps on a resume as a negative thing. It may be very hard to get the job you deserve."" Unfortunately, even mothers who don't take extended leave often have trouble getting promoted after they've had children. Childless women were eight times more likely to be promoted than mothers, a disparity that doesn't occur among men, one study found. 3. Trade-offs on long-term goals If you have the option of paying for child care or having one parent stay home, Green says it's important to think about what sacrifices you may have to make in order to go either route. You might be sacrificing career growth by staying home, or you may be sacrificing some of your ability to build wealth by paying for child care. ""You need to really crunch some numbers to understand what sacrifices you may need to make in the short, medium, and long-term and the feasibility of doing that,"" she said. ""What trade-offs may you have to make and how willing are you to do so?""

Steve Bannon, a former aide to Donald Trump, reported to prison on Monday to begin a four-month sentence for refusing to comply with a congressional subpoena.

Bannon entered the federal correctional institution in Danbury, Connecticut, around 12:00 p.m., NBC News reported.

In July 2022, a Washington, D.C., federal jury found Bannon guilty of two counts of contempt of Congress after he refused to provide testimony and records to the House select committee investigating the Jan. 6, 2021, riot at the U.S. Capitol.

Bannon's sentence was stayed pending an appeal. But after a federal appeals court panel upheld Bannon's conviction in May, a federal judge in early June ordered him to report to jail by July 1.

Bannon had argued that he was not guilty of contempt because his lawyers advised him to not comply with the congressional subpoena based on the chance his testimony might be covered by executive privilege — a defense the appeals court rejected.","Steve Bannon, former top advisor to Donald Trump, greets supporters as he arrives to speak with media before he reports to prison at the U.S. federal correctional institution in Danbury, Connecticut, on July 1, 2024.

It said it agreed to pay $37.25 a share in Boeing stock for Spirit, giving the aerospace company an equity value of $4.7 billion. Including Spirit's debt the deal has a transaction value of $8.3 billion Boeing said. Spirit's shares closed Friday at $32.87 a share, giving it a market capitalization of about $3.8 billion.

Boeing in March disclosed it was in talks to acquire the Wichita, Kansas-based company, weeks after a fuselage panel blew out midair from a nearly new Boeing 737 Max 9 on an Alaska Airlines flight, sparking a fresh crisis for Boeing. Spirit makes the fuselages for the 737 and other parts, including sections of Boeing's 787 Dreamliners.

In 2005, Boeing spun off operations in Kansas and Oklahoma that became the present-day Spirit AeroSystems. Boeing accounted for about 70% of Spirit's revenue last year, while roughly a quarter came from making parts for Boeing's main rival, Airbus, according to a securities filing.

Boeing CEO Dave Calhoun, who has said he will step down at the end of the year, on Monday said bringing Spirit in-house will ""fully align"" the companies' production systems and workforces.

""Among the many actions we're taking as a company, this is one of the most significant in demonstrating our unwavering commitment to strengthen quality and make certain that Boeing is the company the world needs it to be,"" Calhoun said in a message to employees.

He said he expects the deal to close mid-2025, subject to approval by regulators, Spirit shareholders and the sale of Spirit's operations dedicated to Airbus planes.

Spirit's CEO, Pat Shanahan, is considered a possible successor for Calhoun.

Airbus, meanwhile, said Monday it has reached an agreement with Spirit so that the European aircraft manufacturer is compensated $559 million by Spirit to acquire its manufacturing lines dedicated to Airbus planes. Those include operations in Belfast, Northern Ireland, where the wings and mid-fuselage of the A220 are produced, A220 pylons in Wichita and A350 fuselage sections in North Carolina.","Boeing said Monday that it will buy back its struggling fuselage maker Spirit AeroSystems in an all-stock deal that the plane maker has said will improve safety and quality control.

WASHINGTON — A group of Democrats are raising concerns as to whether companies that received federal funding for semiconductors used the money to support stock buybacks — and criticizing their own party over how the awards are given.

In a letter to Commerce Secretary Gina Raimondo obtained by CNBC, four lawmakers flagged that BAE Systems commenced a round of buybacks in the same period it will be paid a $35 million award from the CHIPS Act.

The letter, led by Sen. Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts and signed by Reps. Sean Casten and Bill Foster of Illinois and Pramila Jayapal of Washington also noted that Intel, which has received the largest award to date — $8.5 billion — was approved by its board of directors to repurchase $7.24 billion in stocks.

Intel CEO Pat Gelsinger told Yahoo Finance last year that the company remains ""committed to the dividend.""

Raimondo has stated that CHIPS funding is not meant to pad companies' bottom lines or support stock buybacks.

But lawmakers urged her to go further, and ban stock buybacks for companies that receive CHIPS funds.

In the letter, lawmakers wrote that the department has continued to ""leave the door open for these large semiconductor companies to take millions or even billions in CHIPS grants, move some money around, and then engage in more stock buybacks.""

""[I]t is difficult to square the buyback history and stated intentions of the CHIPS awardees with Commerce's indication that it will favor manufacturers that make real commitments not to engage in buybacks,"" lawmakers wrote in their letter.

About $33 billion of funding from the CHIPS Act has been allocated, mostly to major companies. According to a statement from the department, the awards are still preliminary and companies are still undergoing a due diligence review.

This isn't the first time Warren has sounded the alarm about companies that receive awards engaging in buybacks.

She wrote to BAE Systems earlier this year, and the company responded that every dollar from the grant will go to its Microelectronics Center. It also said decisions on buybacks were independent from any funds released through the CHIPS Act.

The U.S. stock market has become dominated by about a handful of companies in recent years. Some experts question whether that ""concentrated"" market puts investors at risk, though others think such fears are likely overblown. Let's look at the S&P 500 , the most popular benchmark for U.S. stocks, as an illustration of the dynamics at play. The top 10 stocks in the S&P 500, the largest by market capitalization, accounted for 27% of the index at the end of 2023, nearly double the 14% share a decade earlier, according to a recent Morgan Stanley analysis.

watch now

In other words, for every $100 invested in the index, about $27 was funneled to the stocks of just 10 companies, up from $14 a decade ago. That rate of increase in concentration is the most rapid since 1950, according to Morgan Stanley. It has increased more in 2024: The top 10 stocks accounted for 37% of the index as of June 24, according to FactSet data. The so-called ""Magnificent Seven"" — Apple , Amazon , Alphabet , Meta , Microsoft , Nvidia and Tesla — make up about 31% of the index, it said.

'A bit riskier than people realize'

Some experts fear the largest U.S. companies are having an outsized influence on investors' portfolios. For example, the Magnificent Seven stocks accounted for more than half the S&P 500's gain in 2023, according to Morgan Stanley. Just as those stocks helped push up overall returns, a downturn in one or many of them could put a lot of investor money in jeopardy, some said. For example, Nvidia shed more than $500 billion in market value after a recent three-day sell-off in June, dragging down the S&P 500 into a multiday losing streak. (The stock has since recovered a bit.) The S&P 500's concentration ""is a bit riskier than people realize,"" said Charlie Fitzgerald III, a certified financial planner based in Orlando, Florida. ""Nearly a third of [the S&P 500] is sitting in seven stocks,"" he said. ""You're not diversifying when you're concentrating like this.""

Why stock concentration may not be a concern

The S&P 500 tracks stock prices of the 500 largest publicly traded companies. It does so by market capitalization: The larger a firm's stock valuation, the larger its weighting in the index. Tech-stock euphoria has helped drive higher concentration at the top, particularly among the Magnificent Seven. Collectively, Magnificent Seven stocks are up about 57% in the past year, as of market close on June 27 — more than double the 25% return of the whole S&P 500. Chip maker Nvidia's stock alone has tripled in that time. More from Personal Finance:

Americans struggle to shake off a 'vibecession'

Retirement 'super savers' have the biggest 401(k) balances

Households have seen their buying power grow Despite the sharp increase in stock concentration, some market experts believe the concern may be overblown. For one, many investors are diversified beyond the U.S. stock market. It's ""rare"" for 401(k) investors to own just a U.S. stock fund, for example, according to a recent analysis by John Rekenthaler, vice president of research at Morningstar. Many invest in target-date funds. A Vanguard TDF for near-retirees has a roughly 8% weighting to the Magnificent Seven, while one for younger investors who aim to retire in about three decades has a 13.5% weighting, Rekenthaler wrote in May.

There's precedent for this market concentration

Additionally, the current concentration isn't unprecedented by historical or global standards, according to the Morgan Stanley analysis. Research by finance professors Elroy Dimson, Paul Marsh and Mike Staunton shows that the top 10 stocks made up about 30% of the U.S. stock market in the 1930s and early 1960s, and about 38% in 1900.

The stock market was as concentrated (or more) around the late 1950s and early '60s, for example, a period when ""stocks did just fine,"" said Rekenthaler, whose research examines markets since 1958. ""We've been here before,"" he said. ""And when we were here before, it wasn't particularly bad news."" When there were big market crashes, they generally don't appear to have been associated with stock concentration, he added. When compared with the world's dozen largest stock markets, the U.S. market was the fourth-most-diversified at the end of 2023 — better than that of Switzerland, France, Australia, Germany, South Korea, the United Kingdom, Taiwan and Canada, Morgan Stanley said.

'Sometimes you can be surprised'

Big U.S. companies also generally seem to have the profits to back up their current lofty valuations, unlike during the peak of the dot-com bubble of the late 1990s and early 2000s, experts said. Present-day market leaders ""generally have higher profit margins and returns on equity"" than those in 2000, according to a recent Goldman Sachs Research report. The Magnificent Seven ""are not pie-in-the-sky"" companies: They're generating ""tremendous"" revenue for investors, said Fitzgerald, principal and founding member of Moisand Fitzgerald Tamayo. ""How much more gain can be made is the question,"" he added.

LONDON — There's been one main narrative since the U.K.'s Conservative Prime Minister Rishi Sunak called a general election back in May — that the opposing Labour Party would win the vote with a landslide. While voter polls may have differed in scale and methodology, the results have pointed in one direction, showing that the center-left Labour Party has around a 20-point lead on the Conservatives. Labour is on track to win around 40% of the vote while roughly 20% of the support is projected to go to the Tories, according to a Sky News poll tracker. Reform UK, led by arch-Brexiteer Nigel Farage, is seen with 16% of the vote, after eating away at Tory support, while the Liberal Democrats are seen gaining around 11% and the Greens with 6%. The Scottish National Party is predicted to win 2.9% of the vote. Labour candidates and leader Keir Starmer have been keen to play down the level of support that the party enjoys, fearing voter complacency and the appearance of ""having it in the bag"" — a stance that could prompt voter apathy and a lower turnout of supporters at the polls, or a backlash from Conservative-inclined sections of the electorate. ""The Labour Party wants to be able to be convince voters that it's absolutely central that they turn out and vote, because otherwise the Tories will win, and the Tories are desperate for people to think that they have still got a chance, and therefore it's worth turning up,"" Britain's top polling expert John Curtice told CNBC. Question marks have risen in the past over the accuracy of British voter polls, with previous projections over or underestimating support for various political parties. The errors have often come about because of inadequate sampling or of factors that are harder to control, such as voters being ""shy"" when polled on which party they intended to support.

This year, however, experts tend to agree that the polls show such a swing to Labour that, even if the scale of support were wrong, the overall result would be the same: a convincing win for the opposition party. ""My attitude is [that] a poll should be taken but not inhaled,"" Curtice said wryly. ""The point is, you shouldn't be looking at them to provide you with pinpoint accuracy, they should give you a reasonable indication of the direction of travel."" ""It just so happens that because this is an election in which apparently one party is so far ahead, much as [it was] in 1997, the polls could be quite a bit out — but nobody will notice,"" he noted, referencing the year when the Labour Party won a landslide against the Conservatives, ending the latter party's then 18-year rule.

Labour 'spin'?

The Labour Party itself is understandably keen to downplay the polls, with a spokesperson telling CNBC that the party doesn't comment on projections, ""as they vary and fluctuate."" ""Instead, we're working hard to take our message of change to voters ahead of the only poll that matters, on 4 July,"" the spokesperson stated. On Monday, Keir Starmer said no vote should be taken for granted, asking his supporters to continue campaigning until polls closed on Thursday. ""The fight for change is for you, but change will only happen if you vote for it. That is the message we have to take to every doorstep these last few hours and days until 10 o'clock on Thursday night."" ""Nothing must be taken for granted, every vote has to be earned. The polls don't predict the future, we have to get out there,"" he told campaign supporters in Hitchin.

Labour's former campaign and communications directors, Alastair Campbell, one of the chief strategists behind the rebranding of the party in the 1990s as 'New Labour' ahead of its monumental election win in 1997, told CNBC that he doubts current voter polls. ""I get really worried about about the way that these election debates are now unfolding, virtually everything in the debate at the moment is about these opinion polls,"" he told CNBC two weeks ago. ""Apart from a few postal votes, nobody's voted yet. And I just do not for one second believe that the Conservatives are going to get virtually wiped out, I just don't believe it,"" he said. ""I just think there's something going very, very wrong with these polls, I could be completely wrong, and it's true that Labour have been consistently ahead. But I just wish that, in our election periods, we would talk less about polls and more about what the parties are saying.""

In an exclusive interview with CNBC, Nikolay Storonsky, Revolut's CEO and co-founder, said that the company is feeling confident about securing its British bank license, after overcoming some key hurdles in its more than three-year-long journey toward gaining approval from regulators.

""Hopefully, sooner or later, we'll get it,"" Storonsky told CNBC via video call. Regulators are ""still working on it,"" he added, but so far haven't raised any outstanding concerns with the fintech.

Storonsky noted that Revolut's huge size has meant that it's taken longer for the company to get its banking license approved than would have been the case for smaller companies. Several small financial institutions have been able to win approval for a banking license with few customers, he added.

""U.K. banking licenses are being approved for smaller companies,"" Storonsky said. ""They usually approve someone twice every year,"" and they typically tend to be smaller institutions. ""Of course, we are very large, so it takes extra time.""

Revolut is a licensed electronic money institution, or EMI, in the U.K. But it can't yet offer lending products such as credit cards, personal loans, or mortgages. A bank license would enable it to offer loans in the U.K. The firm has faced lengthy delays to its application, which it filed in 2021.

One key issue the company faced was with its share structure being inconsistent with the rulebook of the Prudential Regulation Authority, which is the regulatory body for the financial services industry that sits under the Bank of England.

Revolut has multiple classes of shares and some of those share classes previously had preferential rights attached. One conditions set by the Bank of England for granting Revolut its U.K. banking license, was to collapse its six classes of shares into ordinary shares.

Revolut has since resolved this, with the company striking a deal with Japanese tech investor SoftBank to transfer its shares in the firm to a unified class, relinquishing preferential rights, according to a person familiar with the matter. News of the resolution with SoftBank was first reported by the Financial Times.","LONDON — The boss of British financial technology giant Revolut told CNBC he is optimistic about the company's chances of being granted a U.K. banking license, as a jump in users saw the firm report record full-year pre-tax profits.

Iran is headed for a runoff election on Friday, July 5, that will see an ultra-right wing hardliner compete against a reformist during a time of intense economic, social, and geopolitical challenges for the Middle Eastern country. The runoff will allow all 61 million eligible Iranian voters to cast their ballots after no presidential candidate managed to win a majority when the country initially voted on June 28 in a snap election, following the death of former Iranian President Ebrahim Raisi in a helicopter crash in May. Amid record low voter turnout of around 40% on Friday — the lowest of any presidential election in the Islamic Republic's 45-year existence — two dramatically different candidates came out on top. Reformist candidate Masoud Pezeshkian came out ahead with 10.4 million of 24.5 million votes cast, while hardline former nuclear negotiator Saeed Jalili came out just behind with 9.4 million votes. The two other candidates in Friday's race — Iranian Parliament Speaker Mohammad Bagher Qalibaf and Shiite cleric Mostafa Pourmohammadi — received 3.3 million votes and roughly 206,000 votes, respectively. Two additional candidates of the six approved to run by Iran's ultra-conservative Guardian Council had dropped out of the race on Thursday. All the candidates are seen as deeply conservative and anti-Western except for Pezeshkian.

A former nuclear negotiator, Jalili currently serves as a representative for Iran's Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei on the Supreme National Security Council, known to be the most hardline wing of the regime and its highest security body. Jalili, 58, is one of the furthest-right wing candidates approved to run in the snap election and is a longtime Iranian government insider, but has also had several failed attempts at running for office. Pezeshkian meanwhile, is by far the most moderate of Iran's presidential candidates. He formerly served as minister of health under Iran's last reformist president Mohammad Khatami, from 1997 to 2005, and Khatami among other reformist politicians have endorsed him. The 69-year-old Pezeshkian has also been a parliament member since 2008. He is a member of the Islamic Consultative Assembly and the vice speaker of parliament. He wants to loosen social restrictions like Iran's strict hijab law and improve relations with the West, including potentially re-starting nuclear talks with world powers.

Japan Airlines and All Nippon Airways updated their websites Friday with ""customer harassment"" policies, in the wake of rising instances of front-line worker abuse occurring across industries in Japan.

Using similarly worded language, the two airlines cited nine behaviors that constitute ""harassment"" under the policies, including:

Abusive language, aggressive tone, insults, discrimination, slander Threatening words or actions Excessive or unreasonable demands Assault Deeds which disrupt business operations (prolonged detention, excessive repetition of requests or complaints) Unpermitted entry to workplace Deeds which deceive its employees Slander against the company or its employees on social media and the internet Sexual harassment

ANA's customer harassment policy also includes voyeurism, stalking and indecent behavior — a jarring reminder of the situations that airline employees can face in an industry that often sees travelers behaving at their worst.

The policies are meant to address a lack of clear standards which has made it difficult for employees to handle customer interactions, ANA's Yoshiko Miyashita, vice president of CS promotion, customer experience management told Nikkei Asia.

""This has placed a significant burden on our employees, leading to cases where some have been forced to take leave,"" she said.

Japan Airlines' policy also mandates airline staff to undergo harassment training — employees will be provided manuals detailing how to quickly and appropriately respond to ""malicious"" behavior.

""We have also established aftercare support for our staff's physical and mental health,"" according to the airline.

Both airlines' policies state that travelers who harass employers will be issued a warning, after which consequences can include denial of boarding and police involvement.","Japan's two largest commercial airlines are toughening their stances against travelers who verbally or physically abuse airline staff.

Millennials are poised to be the wealthiest generation in history, but are they ready to handle the large inflow of money?

A vast $90 trillion wealth transfer over the next 20 years will likely make millennials ""the richest generation in history,"" according to estimates from global real estate consultancy Knight Frank.

It found that the so-called silent generation — those typically born between 1928 to 1945 — and baby boomers — born from 1946 and 1964 — will ""hand over the reins"" to millennials — those born between 1981 and 1996 — when they pass on their assets.

Millennials have been portrayed as lazy and frivolous spenders, more keen to open their purse strings for avocado toasts instead of saving for a house — so just how equipped are they in managing the seismic flow of income?

""The millennials are very ill prepared … they're not as well prepared as the wealth creating generation,"" Salvatore Buscemi, co-founder and managing partner of multi-family office Brahmin Partners told CNBC.

By the time the millennials inherit this wealth, they will be in their 40s and may not have the aptitude for starting their own business or for investing, he elaborated.

""They don't have the skill sets earlier on to be able to do that because they never had to - they were never pushed,"" he said. ""And the problem is - are they going to be motivated later in life to push themselves to acquire these skill sets?"" asked Buscemi, adding that human nature suggests that people are less inclined to pick up new skills as they age.","Millennials are poised to be the wealthiest generation in history, but are they ready to handle the large inflow of money?

Nearly two in three workers around the world are ""vacation deprived,"" according to a new report published by Expedia. However, the report shows the feeling is highest among cultures that take the most days off. Some 84% of Germans and 69% of French respondents said they feel they don't have enough time off, according to Expedia's ""Vacation Deprivation Report"" published on June 20. That's despite respondents from both countries taking the most vacation days — 27 days and 29 days, respectively — in the survey. The survey of more than 11,500 workers showed Americans take the least time off per year (11 days), followed by Japan (12 days). However, only 53% of Japanese said they feel ""vacation deprived"" compared to 65% of Americans, it showed.

The survey — Expedia's 24th annual report on the topic — shows that while vacation deprivation rates have decreased in many parts of the world, the feeling is at an 11-year high in the United States.

What's happening in France and Germany?

Expedia's report indicates that feeling ""vacation deprived"" has less to do with the actual time off one takes, and more to do with cultural mores around work and free time. ""The French overwhelmingly view time off as a basic, fundamental right, while Americans seem to treat is as a guilty pleasure,"" said Christie Hudson, head of public relations for Expedia in the United States. ""This is why not even a month seems like enough time to the average French worker.""

Among Germans, however, only 42% said they feel their employers are supportive of them taking their vacation time, the lowest rate across all markets, said Hudson. ""This can contribute to guilt and being unable to unplug and feel refreshed after vacation,"" she said, adding that ""vacation deprivation"" can result from feeling unable to use the days off you are given, she said.

Wasted vacation days

Despite most workers indicating they feel vacation deprived, respondents from nearly every location admitted to letting some of their annual leave lapse.

Hong Kongers, however, meticulously planned their leave, not allowing a single day to go unused, on average, the report showed. Interestingly, Hong Kong was the only location where workers said they planned to take more time off than they're given, said Hudson. ""In 2024, 15% of Hong Kongers plan on taking 31 vacation days, exceeding the average allotted 25.5 days,"" said Hudson. ""It's an interesting finding and could be linked to the fact that they seem to have a strong pro-PTO culture: 80% of Hong Kong workers agree that their employers are supportive of employees taking their vacation time, which is one of the highest rates globally."" That could mean that ""those few extra days here and there are overlooked,"" she said. Singaporeans, too, carefully plan their time off, allowing only one of their 20 days of annual leave to lapse, according to the report. But those in Japan aren't nearly as focused on maximizing their days off, it showed. Respondents there left seven out of 19 days on the table, on average.

CNBC,https://www.cnbc.com/2024/07/02/gen-z-is-ditching-the-apps-to-date-in-real-life-here-are-4-top-tips-.html,2024-07-02,05:16:18 UTC,Gen Z is ditching dating apps to meet people in real life. Here are 4 top tips.,"Gen Z is tired of dating apps and would prefer meeting people in real life, but the tech-savvy generation isn't as experienced with navigating romance in person.

Dating apps have been losing their appeal amongst singles in recent years, especially Gen Z, the generation born between 1997 and 2012. Only 26% of 18 to 29-year-olds in the U.S. are using online dating services compared with 61% of 30 to 49-year-olds, according to Statista data from September 2023.

Dating apps are no longer cool to the younger generation because they're hyper-aware that these companies are solely focused on making money rather than building a good user experience, according to Jeff Guenther, a licensed professional counselor for individuals and couples and author of ""Big Dating Energy.""

""It feels like signing up for dating apps makes tech boys and Silicon Valley investors richer,"" Guenther told CNBC Make It in an interview. ""They want to keep us on the app as long as possible so they can make money off of us and not really match us up with somebody so that we delete the app,""

Guenther pointed to the various app features hidden behind paywalls, and users experiencing frequent ""micro-rejections"" like ghosting which keeps them hooked.

""There's all these like little micro rejections that are happening that mess with your self-esteem, self-worth, mental health so it feels like it's not the best place to feel good about yourself anymore,"" he said.

At least 95% of Gen Z using the dating app Hinge are fearful of rejection and over half say worrying about rejection has held them back from pursuing potential relationships, according to Hinge's dating trends report published in February 2024.

As a result, Gen Z wants to ditch the apps, including going back to traditional methods of dating such as meeting someone in real life, according to a recent Eventbrite survey of 1,001 respondents in the U.S.

Almost half of Gen Zers are keen to meet life partners through their mutual friends and about a third are hopeful that it will happen in their day-to-day routine, Eventbrite found.

""They grew up with iPhones in their hands and they're such digital natives, they probably haven't had too much practice flirting with people in real life and taking risks and it's scary. It's a vulnerable thing to be in real life and go up and approach somebody or ask somebody on a date,"" Guenther said.

Guenther and Courtney Boyer, a relationship and sexuality expert, shared four top tips for Gen Z to meet people in real life.","Gen Z is tired of dating apps and would prefer meeting people in real life, but the tech-savvy generation isn't as experienced with navigating romance in person.

When including hybrid vehicles, Li Auto remained by far the leader. It delivered 47,774 cars in June, for a first-half total of 188,981 vehicles. Most of the company's cars come with a fuel tank to extend the battery's driving range.

Xpeng remained a laggard, delivering 52,028 cars in total in the first six months of the year, including 10,668 vehicles in June.

That's slightly more than Nio 's 87,426 deliveries for the first six months of 2024, although Nio continued to recover from sluggish performance earlier in the year with a record 21,209 deliveries in June.

BEIJING — Chinese electric car company Zeekr said Monday it delivered a record number of vehicles in June, making its deliveries for the first half of the year the largest among U.S.-listed Chinese companies only selling pure electric cars.

Shares of Zeekr fell by 3.2% in U.S. trading overnight, while Li Auto and Nio both saw shares rise by more than 6%. Xpeng shares rose by nearly 5.2%.

Also offering hybrids, Huawei's jointly developed Aito brand with car manufacturer Seres delivered 184,286 vehicles in the first six months of the year.

Smartphone and home appliance company Xiaomi said it has delivered more than 10,000 cars in June, bringing total deliveries to more than 25,000 since the Hong Kong-listed company launched its electric SU7 in late March.

BYD delivered 1.6 million new energy passenger vehicles in the first half of the year, up nearly 29% from a year ago. Plug-in hybrid cars accounted for a slightly greater share than battery electric vehicles, and saw faster growth at 39.5% versus 17.7% for battery-only cars.

That reflects how much of China's new energy vehicle sales are being driven by hybrid-powered vehicles rather than purely battery-powered ones as range anxiety remains a top concern for consumers in China.

Car companies need to improve the battery charging process, Wan Gang, the man credited with spearheading China's electric car strategy, said at a conference last week.

China's new energy vehicle sales have risen this year to account for 47% of all passenger cars sold in May, according to China Passenger Car Association data, which provides figures mid-month for the prior month. That's up from 32% penetration at the start of the year.

As part of efforts to boost consumption, China this year has launched a trade-in policy to incentivize new energy vehicle sales. Many companies have also slashed prices to remain competitive, and revealed new cars at the Beijing auto show, which ended May 5.","That's slightly more than Nio 's 87,426 deliveries for the first six months of 2024, although Nio continued to recover from sluggish performance earlier in the year with a record 21,209 deliveries in June.

A bitcoin exchange that collapsed 10 years ago after being hacked is set to return billions of dollars' worth of the token to users — and it has investors worried. In a few days, bankrupt Tokyo-based bitcoin exchange Mt. Gox will begin paying back thousands of users almost $9 billion worth of tokens. The platform went under in 2014 following a series of heists that cost it in the range of 650,000 to 950,000 bitcoin, or upward of $58 billion, at current prices. The payout follows a protracted bankruptcy process that's involved multiple delays and legal challenges. On Monday, the court-appointed trustee overseeing the exchange's bankruptcy proceedings said distributions to the firm's roughly 20,000 creditors would begin in early July. Disbursements will be in a mix of bitcoin and bitcoin cash, an early offshoot of the original cryptocurrency. While this is good news for victims of the hack who have spent years waiting to be made whole, the price of bitcoin slid to $59,000 last week, in the crypto market's second-worst weekly decline of the year.

CNBC spoke to half a dozen analysts to get their take on what to expect when roughly 141,000 bitcoin — or roughly 0.7% of the total 19.7 million bitcoins outstanding — are returned to Mt. Gox victims this week.

Pressure on bitcoin could pick up

Mt. Gox — short for ""Magic: The Gathering Online Exchange"" — was once the largest spot bitcoin exchange globally, claiming to handle around 80% of all global dollar trades for bitcoin. When it shuttered in February 2014, bitcoin was worth around $600. Today, the world's largest cryptocurrency is trading at about $61,000 per coin. That means users opting to be reimbursed in-kind — that is, in the cryptocurrency itself, rather than the cash equivalent — have seen the value of their coins surge over 10,000% in the last decade. John Glover, chief investment officer of crypto lending firm Ledn, told CNBC the windfall for Mt. Gox users would likely translate to huge sales in bitcoin as investors look to lock in gains. ""Many will clearly cash out and enjoy the fact that having their assets stuck in the Mt. Gox bankruptcy was the best investment they ever made,"" said Glover, who was previously a managing director at Barclays. ""Some will clearly choose to take the money and run,"" added Glover. James Butterfill, head of research at CoinShares told CNBC the overhang of the nearly $9 billion of bitcoin set to be released has ""long been a concern for those with bullish views on bitcoin."" ""Consequently, the market is highly sensitive to any related news. With the announcement that the Trust will begin selling in July, investors are understandably worried,"" said Butterfill.

It wouldn't be the first time bitcoin's moved in reaction to big redemptions of funds locked up in centralized trading platforms. Last month, crypto exchange Gemini returned more than $2 billion worth of bitcoin to users with funds that had been trapped in its Earn lending program, marking a 230% recovery after bitcoin prices more than tripled since Gemini suspended Earn withdrawals on Nov. 16. JPMorgan analysts linked this to negative price action, saying in a research note last week that it's ""fair to assume that some of Gemini creditors, which are mostly retail customers, have taken at least partial profits in recent weeks."" Similarly, JPMorgan analysts expect Mt. Gox customers to be similarly inclined to sell some of their bitcoin to profit from seismic gains for the cryptocurrency. ""Assuming most of the liquidations by Mt. Gox creditors take place in July, [this] creates a trajectory where crypto prices come under further pressure in July, but start rebounding from August onwards,"" they wrote. Separately last month, the German government sold 5,000 — worth approximately $305.8 million as of Thursday's prices — of a 50,000-bitcoin pile seized in connection with the movie piracy operation Movi2k. The funds were sent to various crypto exchanges, including Coinbase, Kraken, and Bitstamp, according to blockchain intelligence firm Arkham Intelligence. Analysts say these crypto liquidations, too, have placed pressure on bitcoin's price.

Mt. Gox customers expected to hang on to their bitcoin

Most analysts agree losses in bitcoin are likely to be contained and short-lived. ""I think that sell-off concerns relating to Mt. Gox will likely be short-term,"" said Lennix Lai, chief commercial officer of crypto exchange OKX. ""Many of Mt. Gox's early users as well as creditors are long-term bitcoin enthusiasts who are less likely to sell all of their bitcoin immediately,"" he said, adding previous sell-offs by law enforcement, including the Silk Road case, did not result in a sustained catastrophic price drop. Butterfill suggested there's enough market liquidity to cushion the blow of any possible mass market sell action. ""Bitcoin has maintained a daily trading volume of $8.74 billion on trusted exchanges this year, suggesting that liquidity is sufficient to absorb these sales over the summer months,"" said Butterfill. According to CCData research analyst, Jacob Joseph, the markets are more than capable of absorbing the selling pressure. ""Moreover, a healthy part of the creditors are likely to take a 10% haircut on their holdings to receive the repayment early, and not all holdings are set to be liquidated on the open market, reducing the overall selling pressure,"" he said.

Recent price moves suggest the temporary impact of the Mt. Gox repayments may already be priced in, Joseph added. Galaxy Digital's head of research, Alex Thorn, believes fewer coins will be distributed than people think, meaning there will be less sell pressure than the market expects. However, he also wrote in May that, even if only 10% of the bitcoin distributed is sold, ""it will have a market impact."" ""Most of the individual creditors will have their coins deposited directly into a trading account at an exchange, making it extremely easy to sell,"" Thorn said. Vijay Ayyar, head of consumer growth for Asia-Pacific at crypto exchange Gemini, said that the overall impact of the Mt. Gox disbursement is likely to be ""dissipated,"" given the recipients of the funds are varied. On the one hand, there are individual holders who will get their bitcoin straight away. Then there's the ""significant amount"" of bitcoin that will be disbursed out to claims funds, Ayyar said. ""Those funds would then need to distribute these out to their LPs [limited partners], hence the whole process could take a while adding a time element to the impact on price,"" he told CNBC.

Macro headwinds behind bitcoin's fall

It's worth noting there are plenty of other reasons behind bitcoin's recent declines. The cryptocurrency had a stunning rally earlier this year, climbing past $70,000 on the heels of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission's approval of the first spot bitcoin ETF.

Stock Chart Icon Stock chart icon Bitcoin's U.S. dollar price performance, year-to-date.

But investors have remained anxious amid outflows from bitcoin ETFs and sizable market liquidations. The broader macro environment, too, has investors worried. Earlier this month, the Federal Reserve suggested it plans to cut rates just once this year, down from the multiple cuts it had indicated previously. Cryptocurrencies, which are inherently volatile, are particularly sensitive to changes in the interest rate environment. CoinShares' Butterfill said the Fed's new rate forecast was among ""the likely culprits for the recent price decline"" in bitcoin. This, along with other issues, is ""likely to weigh on prices in the lower volume summer months,"" Butterfill said. However, ""the fundamental investment case remains very much intact,"" he added.","In a few days, bankrupt Tokyo-based bitcoin exchange Mt.

CNBC,https://www.cnbc.com/2024/07/01/chewy-shares-rally-20percent-after-sec-filing-reveals-roaring-kitty-keith-gill-has-6point6percent-stake.html,2024-07-01,12:58:18 UTC,Chewy shares rally more than 10% after SEC filing reveals ‘Roaring Kitty’ Keith Gill has 6.6% stake,"The filing showed Roaring Kitty, whose legal name is Keith Gill, bought just over 9 million shares — amounting to a 6.6% stake in the company. That makes him the third-biggest Chewy shareholder, according to FactSet. Based on Friday's close, that stake is valued at more than $245 million.

Shares of Chewy popped in premarket trading Monday after a Securities and Exchange Commission filing showed meme stock trader ""Roaring Kitty"" took a stake in the pet food e-commerce retailer.

The SEC filing also included a section that read: ""Check the appropriate box to designate whether you are a cat."" There was an ""x"" next to a response that read: ""I am not a cat."" This line was included in Gill's statement in a series of congressional hearings about 2021's GameStop trading mania.

The stock was up more than 10% before the bell.

Chewy shares took a wild ride last week after Gill posted a picture on social media platform X of a cartoon dog that resembled Chewy's logo. Shares were up as much as 34% on Thursday but ended the day down slightly.

CNBC emailed Chewy PR seeking comment on the new shareholder.

Gill is known to be a champion of GameStop and has been stirring up trading in the video game company in the last few months. In mid-June, he disclosed a stake of 9.001 million GameStop shares after exiting his massive call options position. It's unclear if he sold his GameStop bet to fund the purchase of Chewy.

GameStop shares fell over 7% in premarket Monday following the news.



There's a big connection between GameStop and Chewy. GameStop CEO Ryan Cohen was the founder and CEO of Chewy, who was instrumental in PetSmart's takeover of Chewy in 2017 and its subsequent initial public offering in 2019.

Cohen joined the GameStop board of directors along with two other Chewy executives in January 2021, partly helping fuel the initial GameStop rally. He later took over as GameStop CEO in 2023, leading a turnaround in the brick-and-mortar video game retailer.

In a recent YouTube livestream, Gill said GameStop is in the second stage of a reinvention, and it has become a bet on Cohen himself, who's been leading a turnaround and pivot to e-commerce.

Gill is a former marketer for Massachusetts Mutual Life Insurance. He came into the limelight after successfully encouraging retail investors to buy GameStop shares and call options in 2021 to squeeze out short-selling hedge funds.","The filing showed Roaring Kitty, whose legal name is Keith Gill, bought just over 9 million shares — amounting to a 6.6% stake in the company.

Starbucks cafes across the country are starting to change how they make drink orders, among other tweaks designed to reduce bottlenecks and long wait times that have dogged the chain. The overhaul comes as the coffee giant prepares for an anticipated swell of orders through its mobile app. At the heart of the plan is Starbucks' ""Siren Craft System,"" a series of processes that are aimed at making baristas' jobs easier and speeding up service times for customers. Starbucks said more than 10% of its 10,000 stores have already implemented the system, which includes changing the production order for hot and cold drinks. It will be in use across North America by the end of July, according to the company. Executives hope the changes will provide a much-needed jolt to Starbucks. In April, the company reported a disappointing second quarter, as U.S. same-store sales fell 3% and traffic dropped 7%. The coffee chain cut its 2024 outlook. Starbucks reported rates of incomplete mobile app orders in the mid-teens and said occasional customers came in less. CEO Laxman Narasimhan mentioned the need to make improvements to stores. Katie Young, senior vice president of store operations at Starbucks, said the most immediate shift that needed to happen in cafes was better handling the unexpected. ""It's the ability to flexibly respond to things we cannot predict,"" she told CNBC in an interview.

The store changes will be key this month, as Starbucks on Monday started opening up its app to non-rewards members, which the company believes will increase traffic and orders. Analyst Peter Saleh, managing director at BTIG, said, ""My sense is that they have a lot of demand in certain stores, and the footprint of the kitchen is so small, you have to find ways to be more efficient."" Losing customers because of slow orders and other store frustrations could cost Starbucks at a particularly vulnerable time. Americans have become cost conscious in the face of ongoing inflation, and in some cases have pulled back on morning or afternoon beverages and snacks. Narasimhan in April said consumers are spending more cautiously. Starbucks has done something uncharacteristic in recent weeks, joining the stream of value offerings with a $5 food and beverage combo option. Communicating value to customers is also part of the plan to drum up business.

The Siren system

Starbucks has been diagnosing the bottleneck issue for more than a year, since the company's reinvention plan rollout in 2022, said Young. At the time, Howard Schultz was at the helm, having returned during a burgeoning unionization movement and shifts in consumer preferences. The changes underway in cafes were first previewed that fall, to be rolled out in the years to come. Narasimhan took over for Schultz in March 2023. The Siren system processes were developed with worker feedback on which issues stopped them from creating beverages and connecting with customers. Starbucks said it plans to add a role akin to an expediter in a restaurant production line, a ""play caller"" who steps away from production and helps solve logjams in cafes, handling tasks such as restocking cups or helping when an unexpected crowd arrives. The company plans to train existing workers for the role or potentially add new baristas, if needed. ""One of the pain points we saw was [that] our espresso machine was often running all the time, and that was one of the things that kept our partners from being able to check in. And another thing we saw that you didn't necessarily know was which part of the store would get crowded,"" Young said. ""We needed to actually have a partner that was dedicated when things got busy to pulling out of production and just helping."" Starbucks said it will also change the order in which beverages are made. Previously, cold drinks were prioritized from start to finish, even if a hot beverage order came in first, as pulling espresso shots was the last step. This could create a traffic jam in the drive-thru, for example, if a person ordered one of each beverage, as the cold item would be ready while the hot drink was still in production. Macoy McLaughlin, manager of Seattle's First and Walker Starbucks location, said producing beverages in the order they were placed allows for a faster, streamlined process. ""We actually have proper sequencing between our hot and cold bars, versus cold bars becoming as popular as ever, to really have a consistent experience for the customers. So we're actually making them in the order they're coming in,"" McLaughlin said, adding that the cafe feels busier, but customers in store and in the drive-thru are getting drinks faster. Baristas also will have more control over the company's digital production manager, an iPad system that controls the sequencing of orders in various channels from cafes, mobile orders and the drive-thru, the company said. Workers will have more flexibility over changing order priority.

Starbucks app expands","At the heart of the plan is Starbucks' ""Siren Craft System,"" a series of processes that are aimed at making baristas' jobs easier and speeding up service times for customers.
Starbucks said more than 10% of its 10,000 stores have already implemented the system, which includes changing the production order for hot and cold drinks.
Starbucks reported rates of incomplete mobile app orders in the mid-teens and said occasional customers came in less.
Losing customers because of slow orders and other store frustrations could cost Starbucks at a particularly vulnerable time.
The company plans to train existing workers for the role or potentially add new baristas, if needed.","['order', 'production', 'orders', 'inside', 'customers', 'store', 'company', 'system', 'stores', 'starbucks', 'cold', 'cafes', 'plans', 'improve', 'baristas']",https://image.cnbcfm.com/api/v1/image/107408068-1714480095054-gettyimages-2040998551-zawrzel-economya240229_npoRp.jpeg?v=1719522289&w=1920&h=1080,

Although the unemployment rate has spent 30 months at or below below 4% — a near record — not everyone who wants a job has one. And not everyone even wants a job at all. Some, referred to as ""NEETs,"" which stands for ""not in employment, education, or training,"" are opting out of the labor force largely because they are discouraged by their economic standing. Others, alternatively, are well-qualified but often younger candidates who are struggling to find positions, comprising a contingent of ""new unemployables,"" according to a recent report by Korn Ferry.

Among 16- to 24-year-olds, the unemployment rate rose to 9% in May, which is ""typical,"" according to Alí Bustamante, a labor economist and director of the Worker Power and Economic Security program at the Roosevelt Institute, a liberal think tank based in New York City. Although the youth unemployment rate fell below 7% in 2023, according to the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics, such lows were ""emblematic of how hot the labor market was at that point,"" Bustamante said. ""9% is basically what we should be expecting during relatively good economic times for younger workers,"" he added.

'NEETS' feel 'left out and left behind'

Still, some young adults in the U.S. are neither working nor learning new skills. In 2023, about 11.2% of young adults ages 15 to 24 in the U.S. were considered as NEETs, according to the International Labour Organization. In other words, roughly one in 10 young people are ""being left out and left behind in many ways,"" Bustamante said. Even though ""that's typically the norm,"" he said, ""we should be expecting these rates to be lower."" More from Personal Finance:

The 'funflation' effect: Why consumers are spending this summer Young men, especially, are increasingly disengaged, according to Julia Pollak, a labor economist at ZipRecruiter. ""The NEET trend is mostly a male phenomenon,"" she said. Pollak explained that's in part due to declining opportunities in traditionally male occupations, such as construction and manufacturing, while ""women's enrollment in schooling, education outcomes, and employment outcomes have mostly trended upwards.""

'Talent hoarding' has led to 'new unemployables'

According to Korn Ferry's report, a ""perfect storm"" has also created a glut of ""new unemployables,"" or highly trained workers who struggle to find job opportunities. ""Employers are holding on to the talent they have and increasingly focusing on talent mobility,"" said David Ellis, senior vice president for global talent acquisition transformation at Korn Ferry. This ""talent hoarding"" has led to fewer available job openings even for well-qualified candidates, he said.

At the same time, firms are scaling back on new hires, limiting the opportunities at the entry level, as well. While the teen employment rate is the highest it has been in over a decade, early 20-somethings are struggling to find jobs, Pollak said. ""It's the 20- to 24-year-olds that saw a massive drop off in the labor force participation during the pandemic, and who have lagged behind ever since."" Overall, hiring projections for the class of 2024 fell 5.8% from last year, according to a report from the National Association of Colleges and Employers, or NACE. As more candidates compete for fewer positions, stretches of unemployment are also lengthening. Now, the number of people unemployed for longer than six months is up 21%, Korn Ferry found.

Google will partner with BlackRock to develop a 1 gigawatt pipeline of new solar capacity in Taiwan, the U.S. tech giant announced Monday as it seeks to boost energy capacity and cut carbon emissions amid the artificial intelligence boom.

The deal will see Google make a capital investment, yet to be approved by regulators, in Taiwanese solar developer New Green Power ""to facilitate the buildout of its large-scale solar pipeline.""

Google did not reveal how much it was investing into New Green Power, a BlackRock portfolio firm.

The investment will boost clean energy on Taiwan's local electricity grid, and help Google reach its goal of achieving net-zero emissions across all its operations and value chain by 2030, the company said.

The new solar capacity will help power Google's data centers and cloud region in Taiwan, the press release said. Some of the clean energy capacity will also be offered to Google's chip suppliers and manufacturers in the region, it said.

""We expect to procure up to 300 [megawatts] of solar energy from this pipeline through power purchase agreements (PPAs) and the associated energy attribute certificates (Taiwan Renewable Energy Certificates or T-RECS) to help meet electricity demand from our data center campus, cloud region and office operations in Taiwan,"" Amanda Peterson Corio, global head of data center energy at Google, said in a blog post Monday.

The controlling family of the ownership group, Boston Basketball Partners LLC, said it intends to sell all of its shares in the team ""for estate and family planning consideration.""

Top heavy : Stocks were on pace for a higher close Monday in what has been a volatile session for both equities and bonds. The 10-year Treasury yield was once again nearing 4.5%. Picking up where the second quarter left off, the mega tech stocks continued doing the heavy lifting for the S & P 500 , with Club names Apple up more than 2.5%, Amazon up over 2%, and Microsoft up roughly 1.5%. The average stock, however, was having a rougher time, as indicated by the S & P 500 Equal Weight index , which was down nearly 1% on the session. Monday was the start of the third quarter on Wall Street, with hopes for the kind of strength the market saw in the first half of 2024. Downgrade : We're dropping Estee Lauder to our 2 rating from a buy-equivalent 1 rating and lowering our price target to $140 per share from $162. That PT is slightly below the current consensus of $148, following a string of negative data points toward the end of last week. First, it was the Nike earnings call, which was downbeat on China. Management said its quarterly results fell below plan there when excluding a timing benefit. Nike lowered its outlook for Greater China — pointing to a highly promotional environment. Then there was a negative update last Friday from L'Oreal CEO Nicolas Hieronimus at a JPMorgan investor event. Globally, the CEO said the beauty market is growing somewhere between 4.5% to 5%, which is slightly lower than previous expectations. The key reason behind the sluggishness is the lack of growth in China's beauty market, which Hieronimus called ""quite gloomy right now"" with the rebound not materializing. EL YTD mountain Estee Lauder YTD You could argue points: (1) that a lot of this downside could already be priced into Estee Lauder stock down at these low levels and (2) that it is a special situation since the company has said it has moved past its inventory glut and has a profit recovery plan in place to improve margins. We previously thought these two factors would be sufficient for the stock to find its footing. But disappointingly, it has not materialized as expected. If the latest signs point to a Chinese market that is still struggling to recover, then we need to hold off from adding until we see more evidence of this turnaround taking shape.

CNBC,https://www.cnbc.com/2024/07/01/paramount-streaming-merger-talks.html,2024-07-01,20:57:17 UTC,"Paramount is hunting for a streaming partner, could kick off a wave of deals","Paramount Global is holding talks with other entertainment companies about merging its Paramount+ streaming service with an existing platform. If it reaches a deal, it may kick off a new wave of streaming partnerships that could put the entire media industry on firmer footing.

Paramount Global leadership is having active discussions with other media and tech company executives to determine if a structure makes sense for both parties where Paramount+ can be merged with another streaming entity and potentially co-owned, according to people familiar with the matter, who asked not to be named because the discussions are private.

One of the companies that has expressed a desire to reach a deal is Warner Bros. Discovery , according to people familiar with the matter. Combining Max and Paramount+ could strengthen both services by allowing them to better compete with Netflix and Disney's suite of platforms (Disney+, Hulu and ESPN) for eyeballs and future content.

Warner Bros. Discovery held preliminary merger talks for a deal for all of Paramount Global earlier this year, but talks didn't escalate.

Paramount Global is also considering partnering with a technology platform, the company's co-CEO Chris McCarthy said at an employee town hall on June 25.

""What they don't have is our scale of content, and together we will make for a very powerful combination to drive more minutes and greater profits,"" McCarthy said of a potential tech partner at the town hall, according to a transcript of the event obtained by CNBC.

A merged streaming service would mitigate churn by giving customers more diverse programming and fewer reasons to cancel each month, and it could take Paramount+ losses off Paramount Global's balance sheet by giving it new ownership.

While a structure for a hypothetical joint venture with Warner Bros. Discovery hasn't been discussed in detail, ownership likely wouldn't be a 50-50 split given the existing natures of the streaming assets and their finances, according to people familiar with the discussions.

Warner Bros. Discovery's direct-to-consumer business made $103 million in annual adjusted EBITDA in 2023 after losing $2.1 billion the year before. Paramount Global reported a loss of $1.67 billion in direct-to-consumer operating income before depreciation and amortization in 2023, narrower than its $1.8 billion loss a year prior.

Max has about 100 million global subscribers, with 52.7 million based in the U.S. Paramount+ ended its first quarter with 71 million subscribers.

Comcast's NBCUniversal has also expressed interest in a joint venture with Paramount+, as The Wall Street Journal first reported earlier this year. The talks didn't progress and never got particularly far, according to people familiar with the matter.

""The sheer volume of hit content that we could offer together would be tremendous across TV, film and sports, and would attract millions of viewers,"" McCarthy said during the town hall in reference to a potential partnership with an existing subscription streaming service like Max or Peacock. ""Plus, we would share in all other non-content expenses.""

Optimism in artificial intelligence drove up Taiwan's stock market in the first of the 2024, making it the top performing market in Asia-Pacific so far this year. The Taiwan Weighted Index has surged 28% so far this year, powered by stocks along the AI value chain. Heavyweight Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Corp climbed 63% in the first half of the year, while its rival Foxconn — traded as Hon Hai Precision Industry — jumped 105% in the same period. ""The performance of global markets this year has been largely driven by the themes of Artificial Intelligence and central bank policy, and that is likely to continue,"" said Rahul Ghosh, global equity portfolio specialist at asset management company T. Rowe Price said in the firm's investment outlook. The potential and scale of the AI investment cycle continues to drive economic activity globally, he said, adding that the impact of AI investments are broadening out to sectors such as industrials, materials and utilities.

Japan's benchmark index Nikkei 225 ranked second in the region, after repeatedly surpassing all-time highs earlier this year. In the first six months of the year, the Nikkei has gained about 18%. The Nikkei smashed past a 34-year record in February, breaching its previous all-time high of 38,915.87, set on Dec. 29, 1989. Following that, the index surged past the psychological threshold of 40,000, and eventually reached a new all-time closing high of 40,888.43 on March 22. While Taiwan may lead Asian markets, Japan seems to be the favored market going forward, among analysts who spoke to CNBC.

Ghosh said that improved corporate governance standards continue to have a tangible — and considerable — impact on company performance in the world's fourth largest economy. Furthermore, a June 14 note from Ben Powell, chief APAC investment strategist at the BlackRock Investment Institute, pointed out that the Bank of Japan has increasing confidence it will meet its inflation targets, and as such, normalize its monetary policy ""in a gradual and measured way."" Powell said Japan's macroeconomic backdrop is favorable for risk assets. ""We remain overweight Japanese equities, driven by strong corporate reform momentum, healthy earnings and the valuation support from still-negative real interest rates."" While most Asian markets are in positive territory year-to-date, three stock markets — Thailand, Indonesia and the Philippines — fell into negative territory. Thailand's SET Index plunged 8% in the first six months, to be the worst performing index in the region. The Jakarta Composite was down by 2.88% while the Philippine stock exchange index slipped about 0.6% in the same period.

All eyes on the Fed

Most central banks in Asia are keeping a close eye on the Federal Reserve's next move, as they typically make monetary policy decisions based on the U.S. central bank's anticipated moves. The Fed signaled toward the end of 2023 that several rate cuts were on the cards this year. However, the most recent ""dot plot"" from the Fed's May meeting projected only one cut of 25 basis points for the remainder of 2024.This was a huge departure from the graph released at the end of March, where the Fed implied that rates will be cut by 75 basis points in 2024. The dot plot is a visual representation of each FOMC member's interest rate projection for the bank's short-term interest rate at specific points in the future. The central bank, however, has penciled in a more aggressive path to tightening monetary policy in 2025, increasing its forecast to four cuts of 25 basis points each.

watch now

Rate cut expectations have been pushed back repeatedly as inflation remained stickier than expected. Higher employment and wage growth in the U.S. also added to the narrative that there was no need for the Fed to lower rates. The question now is: When will the first rate cut happen? The CME FedWatch tool indicates that 61% of traders expect the Fed to cut rates by 25 basis points in the September meeting. But on June 16, Minneapolis Federal Reserve President Neel Kashkari said it's a ""reasonable prediction"" that the U.S. central bank will cut interest rates once this year, but will wait until December to do it. Kashkari's view was echoed by Ken Orchard, head of international fixed income at asset management firm T. Rowe Price. ""We still see the Fed cutting 25 basis points at its December policy meeting, after the November elections are out of the way, and possibly once in the summer.""

According to a regulatory filing on Monday, the resolution to approve the compensation received 339.3 million votes in favor and 404.8 million against at the annual meeting held on Thursday.

The board had urged shareholders to vote in favor of the resolution. But two shareholder advisory firms, Glass Lewis and Institutional Shareholder Services, both recommended that investors vote down the measure.

For the 2024 fiscal year, Benioff received $39.6 million in total pay, up from $29.9 million in the prior year. While Benioff's salary was flat at $1.55 million, he received additional stock and option awards and nonequity incentive plan compensation, according to the proxy statement. The most recent sum also included security fees that had not previously been invoiced to the company.

In January, the board's compensation committee gave Benioff a second long-term equity award worth $20 million, in recognition of the company's ""successful transformation actions and strong financial performance in the fiscal year,"" among other factors.

Glass Lewis wrote in its recommendation that ""shareholders may reasonably be wary of the substantial discretionary equity grants"" issued to Benioff in January, adding that there was a ""lack of a fully convincing rationale"" behind the grants.

Benioff was already among the largest holders of Salesforce, with a stake of over 2% valued at close to $6 billion. Glass Lewis said in its proxy paper that the additional performance-based restricted stock units and stock options were ""unwarranted"" because his interests were already aligned with that of shareholders.

The vote from the annual meeting is nonbinding.

""Our Compensation Committee, which is responsible for designing and administering our executive compensation program, values the opinions expressed by our stockholders and will consider the outcome of this vote when making future executive compensation decisions,"" Salesforce's board said in the company's proxy statement.

The company declined to comment.

Salesforce shares rose 67% in the 2024 fiscal year ended Jan. 31, the strongest performance since 2011.

Net income jumped to $4.1 billion in the fiscal year from $208 million a year earlier, while revenue increased 11% to $34.9 billion from $31.4 billion. In January 2023, Salesforce announced plans to lay off 10% of employees, after activist investors began buying up stakes and demanding a better mix of profit and growth. Salesforce said in February it would begin paying a dividend to shareholders.

Salesforce shares are off 2.6% year to date.","Salesforce investors voted against the company's compensation plan for top executives, after shareholder advisory groups raised concerns about equity awards granted to CEO Marc Benioff.
According to a regulatory filing on Monday, the resolution to approve the compensation received 339.3 million votes in favor and 404.8 million against at the annual meeting held on Thursday.
For the 2024 fiscal year, Benioff received $39.6 million in total pay, up from $29.9 million in the prior year.
While Benioff's salary was flat at $1.55 million, he received additional stock and option awards and nonequity incentive plan compensation, according to the proxy statement.
Benioff was already among the largest holders of Salesforce, with a stake of over 2% valued at close to $6 billion.","['ceo', 'plan', 'million', 'shareholders', 'execs', 'vote', 'stock', 'shareholder', 'fiscal', 'proxy', 'benioff', 'received', 'salesforce', 'compensation', 'billion', 'marc', 'reject']",https://image.cnbcfm.com/api/v1/image/108000605-1719870543774-gettyimages-1934266410-AA_18012024_1494483.jpeg?v=1719870616&w=1920&h=1080,
CNBC,https://www.cnbc.com/2024/07/01/donald-trump-crypto-take-aim-at-sec-as-biden-allies-raise-alarms.html,2024-07-02,00:29:55 UTC,Crypto takes its fight with SEC directly to Biden and Trump,"Former U.S. President and Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump looks on during his campaign event, in Racine, Wisconsin, U.S. June 18, 2024.

On a cool, sunny June evening in San Francisco, the Pacific Heights mansion of venture capitalist David Sacks was the scene of an event that is rare to see in one of America's most progressive cities: a high-dollar, Republican political fundraiser.

The guest of honor on this night was former President Donald Trump, who delivered formal remarks from a curtained stage to guests who had paid up to $300,000 to be there.

The presumptive Republican presidential nominee promised to loosen the regulation of cryptocurrencies if he is elected in November, and to ""get out of the way of innovation,"" a person who was in the room told CNBC. When he was finished, Trump invited the audience members to pipe up.

Stuart Alderoty, chief legal officer of the blockchain giant Ripple, explained the company had spent over $100 million defending itself in litigation brought by the Securities and Exchange Commission.

Alderoty's comment was meant as a example of how the SEC's regulatory actions under Chair Gary Gensler had hampered his company and the industry at large, according to a guest and a person familiar with the situation, who were granted anonymity to describe a private meeting.

As Alderoty spoke, a second crypto executive whose company is also fighting the SEC was in the audience: Paul Grewal, the chief legal officer of Coinbase .

In 2020, before President Joe Biden took office, the SEC accused Ripple and its founders of violating securities laws by acting as unregistered brokers of digital currency tokens, which the SEC regulates as securities. In 2023, the regulator filed a similar complaint against Coinbase, the largest U.S. crypto exchange platform.

The cases are ongoing, and both firms have denied they broke securities laws. Alderoty's comments at the Trump fundraiser have not been previously reported, but he has made similar remarks elsewhere.

This frustration with Gensler's regulatory agenda has taken on a political tenor this year, as crypto investors seek to exert more influence in Washington, D.C.

Trump has seized on this frustration in recent months, recasting himself from a crypto skeptic into a crypto supporter. Early signs show that shift is winning Trump support in the small but loud crypto community.

Some in the industry who are siding with Trump are going farther than just complaining about Gensler. Instead, they're trying to shape the agency in a potential future Trump administration — starting at the top.

In recent weeks, crypto investors have raised several names of potential nominees for SEC commissioner, in the event that Trump is elected to a second term, according to three people who have knowledge of the conversations.

These names include two former chairs of the Commodity Futures Trading Commission during the Trump administration: J. Christopher Giancarlo and Heath Tarbert.","Former U.S. President and Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump looks on during his campaign event, in Racine, Wisconsin, U.S. June 18, 2024.

Facebook parent company Meta was on Monday accused by EU regulators of failing to comply with the bloc's landmark antitrust rules over its recently introduced ad-supported social networking service. The Commission labelled the ad-supported subscription option a ""pay or consent"" model — which means users have to either pay to use Meta's platforms ad-free, or consent to their data being processed for personalized advertising. The service was introduced for Facebook and Instagram in Europe last year. ""In the Commission's preliminary view, this binary choice forces users to consent to the combination of their personal data and fails to provide them a less personalised but equivalent version of Meta's social networks,"" regulators said in a statement Monday. A Meta spokesperson told CNBC in a statement that its ad-supported subscription model ""follows the direction of the highest court in Europe and complies with the DMA."" ""We look forward to further constructive dialogue with the European Commission to bring this investigation to a close,"" the spokesperson added.

Meta introduced the new model in response to a ruling from the European Court of Justice, the EU's top court, last year that a company may offer an ""alternative"" version of its service that does not rely on data collection for ads. Meta has previously pointed to this ruling as a reason for introducing the subscription offer. In its statement Monday, the Commission said that Meta's ad-supported offering failed to comply with the DMA for two key reasons: one is that it doesn't let users opt for a service that uses less personal data but is still equivalent to the ""personalized ads""-based service. Regulators said users should still be entitled to ""get access to an equivalent service which uses less of their personal data, in this case for the personalization of advertising."" The other reason cited by the EU is that the Meta ad-supported service doesn't allow users to exercise their right to ""freely consent"" for their personal data to be used to target them with online ads.

French stocks staged a relief rally early Monday after results from the first round of the nation's snap election raised expectations of a hung parliament. The far-right National Rally party and its allies won 33.1% of the vote, the left-wing NFP alliance was second with 28% and Macron's coalition secured 20%, France's Interior Ministry said Monday. France's benchmark CAC 40 index was 1.3% higher by 10:17 a.m. London time, off earlier highs of more than 2.5%. ""The election, in the end, tells us pretty much what we knew before, which is that the most likely scenario remains a hung parliament,"" Sebastian Paris Horvitz, director of research at La Banque Postale Asset Management, told CNBC's ""Squawk Box Europe."" From a market perspective that is the ""least bad"" option, he added, although it's far from ideal. ""Generally you have a majority to govern France ... After the second round, maybe we are not going to have such a majority. And so we have to figure out how France will be governed.""

It comes after economists at Citi and elsewhere warned that an outright victory for either the far-right or leftist alliance could cause a severe market shock given their tax and spending plans, with the potential to spiral into a debt crisis. ""A hung parliament appears likely and would, we believe, be seen as a positive development for European assets, as markets would price in policies on tax and immigration that would more closely resemble the status quo,"" Matthew Ryan, head of market strategy at financial services firm Ebury, said in a note Monday. ""Following their strong showing in the first round, the possibility of a majority for National Rally remains in play, however, which could act to cap gains in the euro in the coming days.""

Stock Chart Icon Stock chart icon Euro/U.S. dollar.

The second round of the vote is due on July 7 and to win a majority, the National Rally would need to secure 289 out of 577 seats in the National Assembly, France's lower house of parliament. Current candidates now have until Tuesday evening to confirm whether they will be proceeding to the final round. Some left-wing and centrist candidates who placed third in their local race are expected to drop out to avoiding splitting the vote, in an effort to curb far-right gains. This has added to uncertainty over the final result.

A key question remains who will be prime minister — a position currently held by Gabriel Attal, an ally of President Emmanuel Macron. National Rally is hoping it will be the party's 28-year-old leader, Jordan Bardella. With Macron previously stating he plans to carry out the remainder of his term as president until 2027, this would lead to a ""cohabitation"" scenario in which the two roles are at odds. Even in a hung parliament — where no party has an overall majority, making it difficult to pass bills and implement a broad agenda — the French Constitution allows for the continuation of the current budget, so areas such as pension payments are not destabilized, Horvitz said.

""Still, there is no reform,"" he continued, noting this comes as a critical time for Europe as it deals with defense threats, the energy transition and weak French and German economic growth. Horvitz added that French borrowing costs, which have soared versus Germany's since the election was called, are likely to remain elevated. That will likely lead to continued pressure on assets linked to bonds, including bank stocks and some utilities, he said.

For the third year in a row, Vienna, the capital of Austria, is the world's most livable city, according to the Economist Intelligence Unit.

The annual report, which aims to show how comfortable or livable a city is, examined 173 cities globally based on 30 indicators organized into five categories: stability, health care, culture and environment, education and infrastructure.

Boosted by its perfect scores for stability, health care, education and infrastructure, Vienna led this year's list, followed closely by its Western European counterparts: Copenhagen, Denmark, in second place and Zurich, Switzerland, in third.

Vienna's overall score took a minor hit in the culture and environment categories, ""owing to a lack of major sporting events,"" according to the EIU Global Liveability Index for 2024.

""EIU's Liveability Index has risen fractionally over the past year,"" the report said. ""Declines in stability and infrastructure across a number of cities in advanced economies were offset by structural improvements in healthcare and education in several cities in developing markets.""

Four Asia-Pacific cities made it to this year's top 10: Australian cities Melbourne and Sydney, as well as Osaka, Japan, and Auckland, New Zealand.

Melbourne, Sydney and Vancouver made the top 10 this year, but slipped ""amid a significant shortfall in housing availability,"" the EIU said. For the same reason, Toronto fell to 12th place this year, after ranking among the top 10 in the previous two years.

Western Europe was the best-performing region for livability globally, scoring an overall 92 out of 100. However, it has dropped since last year due to an increase in protests and crime, which weighed on the stability category, according to the report.

North America was the second best region, scoring an average of 90.5 out of 100, and ranking highest for education.

But the one thing they all have in common is that they're irrational, according to one phobia specialist.

""A phobia is an irrational response to a benign substance,"" Christopher Paul Jones, a London-based phobia specialist with a clinic on London's Harley Street, told CNBC Make It in an interview.

""As human beings, we are primitively hardwired that when we experience danger, our amygdala fires off, and then we do one of several things. Most commonly fight, flight, or freeze. So, either get angry and punch the thing, or we run from the thing, or we hide from the thing,"" he said. The amygdala is a part of the brain that processes emotions like fear or motivation.

This trigger is handy when we were fighting saber-toothed tigers or if we were in actual danger, Jones said. However, a phobia is when that response is to something that isn't dangerous.

Jones' clinic has treated a variety of phobias from a fear of water, heights, germs, needles, and even the fear of failure.

He explained that phobias develop through a conditioned response like that of Pavlov's dogs experiment. That famous experiment was carried out by Russian neurologist Ivan Pavlov who would ring a bell every time he fed his dogs. The dogs eventually started to salivate when they heard the bell ring because they associated it with food.

""Human beings do the same thing,"" Jones explained. ""Most commonly with a phobia, at some point in your past, your brain has linked danger to something that has happened ... then whenever you think about that thing again in the future, it fires off that old response.""

Jones' recently published book ""Face Your Fears"" guides readers through exercises to help them overcome their fears. He shared his three top tips to overcome any fear with CNBC Make It.","Phobias come in many forms: Some people fear spiders while others fear flying on a plane.

In an exclusive interview with CNBC, Nikolay Storonsky, Revolut's CEO and co-founder, said that the company is feeling confident about securing its British bank license, after overcoming some key hurdles in its more than three-year-long journey toward gaining approval from regulators.

""Hopefully, sooner or later, we'll get it,"" Storonsky told CNBC via video call. Regulators are ""still working on it,"" he added, but so far haven't raised any outstanding concerns with the fintech.

Storonsky noted that Revolut's huge size has meant that it's taken longer for the company to get its banking license approved than would have been the case for smaller companies. Several small financial institutions have been able to win approval for a banking license with few customers, he added.

""U.K. banking licenses are being approved for smaller companies,"" Storonsky said. ""They usually approve someone twice every year,"" and they typically tend to be smaller institutions. ""Of course, we are very large, so it takes extra time.""

Revolut is a licensed electronic money institution, or EMI, in the U.K. But it can't yet offer lending products such as credit cards, personal loans, or mortgages. A bank license would enable it to offer loans in the U.K. The firm has faced lengthy delays to its application, which it filed in 2021.

One key issue the company faced was with its share structure being inconsistent with the rulebook of the Prudential Regulation Authority, which is the regulatory body for the financial services industry that sits under the Bank of England.

Revolut has multiple classes of shares and some of those share classes previously had preferential rights attached. One conditions set by the Bank of England for granting Revolut its U.K. banking license, was to collapse its six classes of shares into ordinary shares.

Revolut has since resolved this, with the company striking a deal with Japanese tech investor SoftBank to transfer its shares in the firm to a unified class, relinquishing preferential rights, according to a person familiar with the matter. News of the resolution with SoftBank was first reported by the Financial Times.","LONDON — The boss of British financial technology giant Revolut told CNBC he is optimistic about the company's chances of being granted a U.K. banking license, as a jump in users saw the firm report record full-year pre-tax profits.

""We are at what is widely viewed as a real inflection point in the evolution of technology, with the rise of large language models. Some are convinced that within three years almost everything we do as humans will be done in one form or another by LLMs and other AI tools,"" Griffin said Friday during an event for Citadel's new class of interns in New York. ""For a number of reasons, I am not convinced that these models will achieve that type of breakthrough in the near future.""

The rapid rise of AI has had the world pondering its far-reaching impact on society, including technology-induced job cuts. Elon Musk, CEO of Tesla, is among many who have repeatedly warned of the threats that AI poses to humanity. He has called AI ""more dangerous"" than nuclear weapons, saying there will come a point where ""no job is needed.""

Griffin, whose hedge fund and electronic market maker have been at the forefront of automation, said machine-learning tools do have their limits when it comes to adapting to changes.

""Machine learning models do not do well in a world where regimes shift. Self-driving cars don't work very well in the North due to snow. When the terrain changes, they have no idea what to do,"" Griffin said. ""Machine learning models do much better when there's consistency.""

Still, the billionaire investor thinks the power of advanced technology can't be dismissed in the long term, and he even sees cancer being eradicated one day because of it.

Citadel has long placed a great emphasis on hiring, not hesitant about putting responsibility into the hands of young employees and even interns, the CEO said.

The firm's internship program has become one of the most competitive in the country. More than 85,000 students applied for about 300 positions this year, reflecting an acceptance rate of less than 0.5%, which is lower than that of Harvard University and the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.

""The people we hire today are going to be the leaders of Citadel not in 30 or 40 years, but in just a few years,"" Griffin said.","Ken Griffin, founder and CEO of Citadel, said he remains skeptical that artificial intelligence could soon make human jobs obsolete as he sees flaws in machine learning models applied in certain scenarios.

The U.S. stock market has become dominated by about a handful of companies in recent years. Some experts question whether that ""concentrated"" market puts investors at risk, though others think such fears are likely overblown. Let's look at the S&P 500 , the most popular benchmark for U.S. stocks, as an illustration of the dynamics at play. The top 10 stocks in the S&P 500, the largest by market capitalization, accounted for 27% of the index at the end of 2023, nearly double the 14% share a decade earlier, according to a recent Morgan Stanley analysis.

In other words, for every $100 invested in the index, about $27 was funneled to the stocks of just 10 companies, up from $14 a decade ago. That rate of increase in concentration is the most rapid since 1950, according to Morgan Stanley. It has increased more in 2024: The top 10 stocks accounted for 37% of the index as of June 24, according to FactSet data. The so-called ""Magnificent Seven"" — Apple , Amazon , Alphabet , Meta , Microsoft , Nvidia and Tesla — make up about 31% of the index, it said.

'A bit riskier than people realize'

Some experts fear the largest U.S. companies are having an outsized influence on investors' portfolios. For example, the Magnificent Seven stocks accounted for more than half the S&P 500's gain in 2023, according to Morgan Stanley. Just as those stocks helped push up overall returns, a downturn in one or many of them could put a lot of investor money in jeopardy, some said. For example, Nvidia shed more than $500 billion in market value after a recent three-day sell-off in June, dragging down the S&P 500 into a multiday losing streak. (The stock has since recovered a bit.) The S&P 500's concentration ""is a bit riskier than people realize,"" said Charlie Fitzgerald III, a certified financial planner based in Orlando, Florida. ""Nearly a third of [the S&P 500] is sitting in seven stocks,"" he said. ""You're not diversifying when you're concentrating like this.""

Why stock concentration may not be a concern

The S&P 500 tracks stock prices of the 500 largest publicly traded companies. It does so by market capitalization: The larger a firm's stock valuation, the larger its weighting in the index. Tech-stock euphoria has helped drive higher concentration at the top, particularly among the Magnificent Seven. Collectively, Magnificent Seven stocks are up about 57% in the past year, as of market close on June 27 — more than double the 25% return of the whole S&P 500. Chip maker Nvidia's stock alone has tripled in that time. More from Personal Finance:

Retirement 'super savers' have the biggest 401(k) balances

Households have seen their buying power grow Despite the sharp increase in stock concentration, some market experts believe the concern may be overblown. For one, many investors are diversified beyond the U.S. stock market. It's ""rare"" for 401(k) investors to own just a U.S. stock fund, for example, according to a recent analysis by John Rekenthaler, vice president of research at Morningstar. Many invest in target-date funds. A Vanguard TDF for near-retirees has a roughly 8% weighting to the Magnificent Seven, while one for younger investors who aim to retire in about three decades has a 13.5% weighting, Rekenthaler wrote in May.

There's precedent for this market concentration

Additionally, the current concentration isn't unprecedented by historical or global standards, according to the Morgan Stanley analysis. Research by finance professors Elroy Dimson, Paul Marsh and Mike Staunton shows that the top 10 stocks made up about 30% of the U.S. stock market in the 1930s and early 1960s, and about 38% in 1900.

The stock market was as concentrated (or more) around the late 1950s and early '60s, for example, a period when ""stocks did just fine,"" said Rekenthaler, whose research examines markets since 1958. ""We've been here before,"" he said. ""And when we were here before, it wasn't particularly bad news."" When there were big market crashes, they generally don't appear to have been associated with stock concentration, he added. When compared with the world's dozen largest stock markets, the U.S. market was the fourth-most-diversified at the end of 2023 — better than that of Switzerland, France, Australia, Germany, South Korea, the United Kingdom, Taiwan and Canada, Morgan Stanley said.

'Sometimes you can be surprised'

Big U.S. companies also generally seem to have the profits to back up their current lofty valuations, unlike during the peak of the dot-com bubble of the late 1990s and early 2000s, experts said. Present-day market leaders ""generally have higher profit margins and returns on equity"" than those in 2000, according to a recent Goldman Sachs Research report. The Magnificent Seven ""are not pie-in-the-sky"" companies: They're generating ""tremendous"" revenue for investors, said Fitzgerald, principal and founding member of Moisand Fitzgerald Tamayo. ""How much more gain can be made is the question,"" he added.

That makes him the third-biggest Chewy shareholder, according to FactSet. Based on Friday's close, that stake is valued at more than $245 million.

Shares of Chewy popped in premarket trading Monday after a Securities and Exchange Commission filing showed meme stock trader ""Roaring Kitty"" took a stake in the pet food e-commerce retailer.

The SEC filing also included a section that read: ""Check the appropriate box to designate whether you are a cat."" There was an ""x"" next to a response that read: ""I am not a cat."" This line was included in Gill's statement in a series of congressional hearings about 2021's GameStop trading mania.

The stock was up more than 10% before the bell.

Chewy shares took a wild ride last week after Gill posted a picture on social media platform X of a cartoon dog that resembled Chewy's logo. Shares were up as much as 34% on Thursday but ended the day down slightly.

CNBC emailed Chewy PR seeking comment on the new shareholder.

Gill is known to be a champion of GameStop and has been stirring up trading in the video game company in the last few months. In mid-June, he disclosed a stake of 9.001 million GameStop shares after exiting his massive call options position. It's unclear if he sold his GameStop bet to fund the purchase of Chewy.

GameStop shares fell over 7% in premarket Monday following the news.



There's a big connection between GameStop and Chewy. GameStop CEO Ryan Cohen was the founder and CEO of Chewy, who was instrumental in PetSmart's takeover of Chewy in 2017 and its subsequent initial public offering in 2019.

Cohen joined the GameStop board of directors along with two other Chewy executives in January 2021, partly helping fuel the initial GameStop rally. He later took over as GameStop CEO in 2023, leading a turnaround in the brick-and-mortar video game retailer.

In a recent YouTube livestream, Gill said GameStop is in the second stage of a reinvention, and it has become a bet on Cohen himself, who's been leading a turnaround and pivot to e-commerce.

Gill is a former marketer for Massachusetts Mutual Life Insurance. He came into the limelight after successfully encouraging retail investors to buy GameStop shares and call options in 2021 to squeeze out short-selling hedge funds.","The filing showed Roaring Kitty, whose legal name is Keith Gill, bought just over 9 million shares — amounting to a 6.6% stake in the company.

VettaFi's Todd Rosenbluth thinks value stocks, which have been market laggards, could get a lift from one of the biggest Wall Street events of the year: the FTSE Russell's annual rebalancing.

""It's worth paying attention to value,"" the firm's head of research told CNBC's ""ETF Edge"" this week. ""It feels like … [for a] long time that growth has outperformed value.""

On Friday, the Russell indexes underwent their annual reconstitution to reflect changes in the market as companies grow and shift. The iShares Russell 1000 Growth ETF is up 20% so far this year, while the iShares Russell 1000 Value ETF is up almost 6%.

""We do think there's a place for both growth and value within a broader portfolio — just people are skewed more toward growth heading into the second half of the year,"" he added. ""There have been periods when the pendulum has swung back in favor of value.""

FTSE Russell CEO Fiona Bassett said on ""ETF Edge"" the indices are built to reflect the nature of the market.

""One of the benefits of the Russell franchise generally is our ability to provide different sleeves of exposure,"" she said. ""So, for those people who want to get concentrated exposure to value or to growth, we have the indices available to do that.""

JPMorgan Chase and Morgan Stanley said Friday that they were boosting both dividend payouts and share repurchases, while rivals Citigroup and Bank of America made more modest announcements.

JPMorgan, the biggest U.S. bank by assets, said it was raising its quarterly dividend 8.7% to $1.25 per share and that it authorized a new $30 billion share repurchase program.

Morgan Stanley, a dominant player in wealth management, said it was boosting its dividend 8.8% to 92.5 cents per share and authorized a $20 billion repurchase plan.

Citigroup said it was raising its dividend 5.7% to 56 cents per share and that it would ""continue to assess share repurchases"" on a quarterly basis.

Bank of America said it was increasing its dividend 8% to 26 cents per share. Its release made no mention of share repurchases.

The big banks announced their plans to boost capital return to shareholders after passing the annual stress test administered by the Federal Reserve this week. While all 31 banks in this year's exam showed regulators they could withstand a severe hypothetical recession, JPMorgan said Wednesday that it could have higher losses than the Fed initially found.

Still, that would not affect its capital-return plan, the New York-based bank said Friday.

Warren Buffett on Friday made his biggest annual donation to date, giving $5.3 billion worth of Berkshire Hathaway shares to five charities.

The legendary investor, who's turning 94 in August, converted 8,674 of his Berkshire Class A shares to donate more than 13 million Class B shares, according to a statement Friday. A total of 9.93 million shares went to the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation, with the rest going to the Susan Thompson Buffett Foundation, named for his late first wife, and the three charities led by his children Howard, Susan and Peter Buffett.

The ""Oracle of Omaha"" has pledged to give away the fortune he built at Berkshire, the Omaha, Nebraska-based conglomerate he started running in 1965. Buffett has been making annual donations to the five charities since 2006.

After Friday's donations, Buffett owns 207,963 Berkshire A shares and 2,586 B shares, worth about $130 billion.

New charitable trust

In an interview with The Wall Street Journal, Buffett clarified that after his death, the enormous fortune he amassed from building the one-of-a-kind conglomerate will be directed to a new charitable trust overseen by his three children.

""It should be used to help the people that haven't been as lucky as we have been,"" he told the Journal. ""There's eight billion people in the world, and me and my kids, we've been in the luckiest 100th of 1% or something. There's lots of ways to help people.""

Buffett has previously said his three children are the executors of his will as well as the named trustees of the charitable trust that will receive 99%-plus of his wealth.

He told the Journal that the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation will no longer receive donations after his death. Buffett resigned as a trustee at the Gates Foundation in June 2021 in the midst of Bill and Melinda Gates' divorce.

At Berkshire's annual meeting in May, Buffett spoke candidly to shareholders about a future when he's no longer at the helm, appearing solemn at times as he pondered his advanced age and reflected on his late friend and business partner Charlie Munger.

Greg Abel, vice chairman for noninsurance operations at Berkshire, has been named Buffett's successor and has taken on most of the responsibility at the conglomerate.

Buffett previously said his will will be made public after his death.

""After my death, the disposition of my assets will be an open book – no 'imaginative' trusts or foreign entities to avoid public scrutiny but rather a simple will available for inspection at the Douglas County Courthouse,"" Buffett said in November.","Warren Buffett speaks during the Berkshire Hathaway Annual Shareholders Meeting in Omaha, Nebraska on May 4, 2024.

HANGZHOU, China — Apple 's mixed-reality headset began deliveries in China on Friday with a retail price roughly 18% higher than in the U.S.

The device starts at 29,999 yuan, or $4,128, in China, compared to a $3,500 retail price in the U.S.

When asked by CNBC, a customer surnamed Chen in Beijing said his suggestion to Apple CEO Tim Cook was to make Vision Pro cheaper by about 10,000 yuan, or $1,376. The customer, who did not share his first name due to concerns about speaking with foreign media, said many people in China might prefer to buy a secondhand Vision Pro because of the discounted price that typically comes with purchases from sellers unaffiliated with Apple.

Many of the most popular posts about the device on Chinese social media platform Weibo on Friday focused on the hashtag ""is it worth paying for the China version of Vision Pro,"" according to a CNBC translation.

CNBC has reached out to Apple for comment.

Greater China accounted for about 18% of Apple's revenue in the three months that ended March 30, according to an Apple filing.

Over the past year, Apple has faced growing competition from Huawei devices and other domestic brands, amid greater attention on national security.

Chen preordered his Vision Pro and was at a major store in Beijing to pick it up and receive some training on how to use it.

Store salespeople told CNBC that all of Friday's half-hour training sessions for preorders of the Vision Pro were booked up at Apple stores in Beijing — from 8 a.m. to 10 p.m.

HANGZHOU, China — The transforming power of artificial intelligence is of no value unless user data is protected, CEO of Chinese smartphone company Honor, George Zhao, told CNBC in an exclusive interview on Thursday. His comments come as Apple this month announced it will start rolling out personalized AI tools on certain devices in the U.S. this fall. Honor already integrates some AI functions, such as enabling users to open text messages and other notifications just by looking at them, or eliminating copy-paste steps by directly linking Yelp-like apps to navigation or ride-hailing apps. This week at Mobile World Congress in Shanghai, Honor unveiled new AI tools for detecting the use of deepfakes in videos, and for simulating lenses that can decrease myopia during long hours of screen usage. Zhao emphasized that Honor's approach is to keep AI operations involving personal data limited to the smartphone. It's also known as on-device AI, and stands in contrast with AI tools that tap cloud computing to operate.

""Without data security and user privacy protection, AI will become worthless,"" Zhao said in Mandarin, translated by CNBC. ""This has always been one of our value propositions."" ""We say user data doesn't leave [the device],"" Zhao said. ""This is a principle we adhere to."" Apple Intelligence, the iPhone company's AI product, claims that it uses on-device processing and draws on ""server-based models"" for more complex requests. Apple said its new ""Private Cloud Compute"" never stores user data. Honor says its on-device AI is self-developed, and the company is working with Baidu and Google Cloud for some other AI features. ""Overall, my view is that AI's development to date has two directions,"" Zhao said. ""Network [cloud] AI has become more and more powerful. But I believe on-device AI, in its capabilities and empowerment of consumers, will become more and more intimate, more and more understanding."" ""It will give consumers more support and help them interact with the future AI world,"" he added.

Zhao pointed out that many generative AI applications, such as from OpenAI's ChatGPT, require large amounts of computing power well beyond the battery capability of a single smartphone. That means they need to use the cloud, which raises questions about the security of data transfer. Balancing AI capabilities with energy usage and data privacy is a ""huge challenge"" for manufacturers, Zhao said. He said a system collecting lots of user data to deliver more personalized features becomes a ""stronger"" object compared to the individual using the system. ""In the future development of smartphones, our goal is that the individual becomes stronger,"" Zhao said. ""When an object becomes stronger, this will reveal the smallness of the individual in its presence. I believe mobile end devices need to empower and enable individuals.""

The IMF, often called the world's ""lender of last resort,"" forecasts that the core personal consumption expenditures price index — the Fed's preferred measure of inflation — will end 2024 at around 2.5% and reach the Fed's 2% target rate by mid-2025, ahead of the Fed's own projection for 2026.

U.S. economic strength during the Fed's rate-hike cycle was aided by labor supply and productivity gains, Georgieva said, while highlighting the need for ""clear evidence"" that inflation is coming down to the 2% target before the Fed cuts rates.

Nonetheless, the IMF's ""more optimistic"" assessment of the downward inflation trajectory is based on indications of a cooling labor market in the U.S. and weakening consumer demand.

""I want to recognize that a lesson we learned from the last [few] years is we are at a time of more uncertainty. This uncertainty also lies ahead. We are confident, however, that the Fed will move through that, and certainly with the same prudence it has demonstrated over the last year,"" Georgieva said.

Roaring Kitty, whose legal name is Keith Gill, has stirred up trading in speculative names such as GameStop by posting cryptic images and memes online. A picture of a cartoon dog appeared on his X feed Thursday afternoon, briefly driving up Chewy shares as much as 34% to $39.10. The stock later fell into negative territory again in Thursday's session, closing the day down 0.3%.

Chewy shares rallied dramatically on Thursday after meme stock leader Roaring Kitty posted a picture on social media platform X that resembles the logo of the online pet food retailer, but the gains were quickly erased later in the session.

There's also a strong connection between meme stock GameStop and Chewy. GameStop CEO Ryan Cohen was the founder and CEO of Chewy, who was instrumental in PetSmart's takeover of Chewy in 2017 and its subsequent initial public offering in 2019.

Cohen joined the GameStop board of directors along with two other Chewy executives in January 2021, partly helping fuel the initial GameStop rally. He later took over as GameStop CEO in 2023, leading a turnaround in the brick-and-mortar video game retailer.

Shares in pet retailers such as Chewy and Petco saw big spikes during the pandemic when stuck-at-home consumers adopted cats and dogs in droves. With the adoptions came purchases of needed accessories such as new beds and leashes for their furry family members.

But as the pandemic ended and people began venturing outside again, adoption numbers slowed and consumers had less need for discretionary pet items such as toys and cages, which carry higher profit margins than pet food.

Over the past year or so, Chewy and Petco have seen consistently strong pet food sales, but revenue for higher margin categories has fallen.

Gill is a former marketer for Massachusetts Mutual Life Insurance. He came into the limelight after successfully encouraging retail investors to buy GameStop shares and call options in 2021 to squeeze out short-selling hedge funds. The mania in 2021 led to a series of congressional hearings featuring Gill in brokers' practices and the ""gamification"" of retail trading.","A picture of a cartoon dog appeared on his X feed Thursday afternoon, briefly driving up Chewy shares as much as 34% to $39.10.

JPMorgan Chase said late Wednesday that the Federal Reserve overestimated a key measure of income in the giant bank's recent stress test, and that its losses under the exam should actually be higher than what the regulator found.

The bank took the unusual step of issuing a press release minutes before midnight ET to disclose its response to the Fed's findings.

JPMorgan said that the Fed's projections for a measure called ""other comprehensive income"" — which represents revenues, expenses and losses that are excluded from net income — ""appears to be too large.""

Under the Fed's table of projected revenue, income and losses though 2026, JPMorgan was assigned $13 billion in OCI, more than any of the 31 lenders in this year's test. It also estimated that the bank would face roughly $107 billion in loan, investment and trading losses in that scenario.

""Should the Firm's analysis be correct, the resulting stress losses would be modestly higher than those disclosed by the Federal Reserve,"" the bank said.

The error means that JPMorgan might require more time to finalize its share repurchase plan, according to a person with knowledge of the situation who declined to be identified speaking about the regulatory process. Banks were expected to begin disclosing those plans on Friday after the market closes.

The news is a wrinkle to the Federal Reserve's announcement Wednesday that all 31 of the banks in the annual exercise cleared the hurdle of being able to withstand a severe hypothetical recession, while maintaining adequate capital levels and the ability to lend to consumers and corporations.

Last year, Bank of America and Citigroup made similar disclosures, saying that estimates of their own future income differed from the Fed's results.

Banks have complained that aspects of the annual exam are opaque and that it's difficult to understand how the Fed produces some of its results.","The bank took the unusual step of issuing a press release minutes before midnight ET to disclose its response to the Fed's findings.

The Federal Reserve said Wednesday that the biggest banks operating in the U.S. would be able to withstand a severe recession scenario while maintaining their ability to lend to consumers and corporations.

Each of the 31 banks in this year's regulatory exercise cleared the hurdle of being able to absorb losses while maintaining more than the minimum required capital levels, the Fed said in a statement.

The stress test assumed that unemployment surges to 10%, commercial real estate values plunge 40% and housing prices fall 36%.

""This year's results show that under our stress scenario, large banks would take nearly $685 billion in total hypothetical losses, yet still have considerably more capital than their minimum common equity requirements,"" said Michael Barr, the Fed's vice chair for supervision. ""This is good news and underscores the usefulness of the extra capital that banks have built in recent years.""

The Fed's stress test is an annual ritual that forces banks to maintain adequate cushions for bad loans and dictates the size of share repurchases and dividends. This year's version included giants such as JPMorgan Chase and Goldman Sachs , credit card companies including American Express and regional lenders such as Truist .

While no bank appeared to get badly tripped up by this year's exercise, which had roughly the same assumptions as the 2023 test, the group's aggregate capital levels fell 2.8 percentage points, which was worse than last year's decline.

That is because the industry is holding more consumer credit card loans and more corporate bonds that have been downgraded. Lending margins have also been squeezed compared to last year, according to the Fed.

""While banks are well-positioned to withstand the specific hypothetical recession we tested them against, the stress test also confirmed that there are some areas to watch,"" Barr said. ""The financial system and its risks are always evolving, and we learned in the Great Recession the cost of failing to acknowledge shifting risks.""

The Fed also performed what it called an ""exploratory analysis"" of funding stresses and a trading meltdown that applied to only the eight biggest banks.

In this exercise, the companies appeared to avoid disaster, despite a sudden surge in the cost of deposits combined with a recession. In a scenario where five large hedge funds implode, the big banks would lose between $70 billion and $85 billion.

""The results demonstrated that these banks have material exposure to hedge funds but that they can withstand different types of trading book shocks,"" the Fed said.

Morgan Stanley is pushing further into its adoption of artificial intelligence with a new assistant that is expected to take over thousands of hours of labor for the bank's financial advisors. The assistant, called Debrief, keeps detailed logs of advisors' meetings and automatically creates draft emails and summaries of the discussions, bank executives told CNBC. Morgan Stanley plans to release the program to the firm's roughly 15,000 advisors by early July, marking one of the most significant steps yet for the use of generative AI at a major Wall Street bank. While the company's earlier efforts involved creating a ChatGPT-like service to help advisors navigate the firm's reams of research, Debrief brings AI into direct contact with advisors' most prized resource: their relationships with rich clients. The program, built using OpenAI's GPT-4, essentially sits in on client Zoom meetings, replacing the note-taking that advisors or junior employees have been doing by hand, according to Jeff McMillan, Morgan Stanley's head of firmwide artificial intelligence. ""What we're finding is that the quality and depth of the notes are just significantly better,"" McMillan told CNBC. ""The truth is, this does a better job of taking notes than the average human.""

Consent required

Importantly, clients must consent to being recorded each time Debrief is used. Future versions will allow advisors to use the program on corporate devices during in-person meetings, said McMillan. The rollout will serve as a real-world test for the vaunted productivity gains of generative AI, which took Wall Street by storm in recent months and has bolstered the value of chipmakers, tech giants and the broader U.S. stock market. Morgan Stanley's wealth management division hosts about 1 million Zoom calls a year, the bank told CNBC. While estimates vary, one Morgan Stanley advisor involved in the Debrief pilot said the program saves 30 minutes of work per meeting; advisors typically spend time after meetings creating notes and action plans to address client needs.

""As a financial adviser I'm doing four, five or six meetings a day,"" said Don Whitehead, a Houston-based advisor who's been testing the software. By ""having the note-taking service built in through AI, you can really be invested in the meeting, you're actually a lot more present."" It remains to be seen what advisors will do with the hours reclaimed from essential grunt work. In a sense, Morgan Stanley's projects in generative AI amount to a ""grand experiment in productivity,"" said McMillan. If, as McMillan and others believe, advisors will spend more time serving clients and prospecting for new ones, the technology should boost Morgan Stanley's growth in assets under management, as well as retention of clients and advisors. Morgan Stanley's wealth management division is one of the world's largest with $5.5 trillion in client assets as of March; the firm wants to reach $10 trillion. It will take at least a year to determine whether the technology is boosting advisor productivity, McMillan said. ""I'm the analytics guy, but the advisors will tell you that they're at their best when they're engaging"" with clients, said McMillan. ""None of them will tell you they love taking notes or looking at research reports, right? That's not why they got into this business.""

""I believe the governments [of China and the European Union] are now considering how, through negotiations, they can combine investment together with commodity trade,"" said Wan Gang, now president of the China Association for Science and Technology.

Wan was speaking via an official English translation during a livestream of a panel at the World Economic Forum's ""Summer Davos"" meeting in Dalian, China. Spokespersons for the European Commission were not immediately available when contacted by CNBC.

But Americans need to do more","How's your 401(k) looking? A new report shows Americans are saving more, but probably need to do even more.

Vanguard has released its annual report, How America Saves 2024. Vanguard and Fidelity are the two biggest sponsors of 401(k) plans, and this is a snapshot of what nearly five million participants are doing with their money.

The good news: stock market returns are up and, thanks largely to automatic enrollment plans, investors are saving more than they did in the past.

The bad news: account balances for the median 401(k) of a person approaching retirement (65+) remains very low.

The takeaway: Americans are still very reliant on Social Security for a large chunk of their retirement.

Higher returns, participation rates, savings rates

Why do we care so much about 401(k) plans? Because it's the main private savings vehicle Americans have for retirement. More than 100 million Americans are covered by these ""defined contribution"" plans, with more than $10 trillion in assets.

First, 2023 was a good year to be an investor. The average total return rate for participants was 18.1%, the best year since 2019.

But to be effective vehicles for retirement, these plans need to: 1) have high participation rates, and 2) hold high levels of savings.

On those fronts, there is good news. John James, managing director of Vanguard's Institutional Investor Group, called it ""a year of progress.""

Plan participation reached all-time highs. Thanks to a change in the law several years ago, a record-high 59% of plans offered automatic enrollment in 401(k) plans. This is a major improvement: ipreviously, enrollment in 401(k) plans were often short of expectations because investors had to ""opt-in,"" that is they had to choose to participate in the plan. Because of indecision or simple ignorance, many did not. By switching to automatic enrollment, participants were automatically enrolled and had to ""opt-out"" if they did not want to participate.

The result: enrollment rates have gone up. Plans with automatic enrollment had a 94% participation rate, compared with 67% for voluntary enrollment plans.

Participant saving rates reached all time highs. The average participant deferred 7.4% of their savings. Including employee and employer contributions, the average total participant contribution rate was 11.7%.

A few other observations about Vanguard's 401(k) plan investors:

They prefer equities and target date funds. They love equities over bonds or any other investments. The average plan contribution to equities is 74%. A record-high 64% of all 2023 contributions went into target-date funds, which automatically adjust stock and bond allocations as the participant ages.

They don't trade much. In 2023, only 5% of nonadvised participants traded within their accounts; 95% did no trading at all. ""Over the past 15 years, we have generally observed a decline in participant trading,"" Vanguard said, which it partially attributed to increased adoption of target-date funds.

Despite gains in the market, account balances are still low

In 2023, the average account balance for Vanguard participants was $134,128, but the median balance (half had more, half had less) was only $35,286.

Why such a big difference between the average and the median? Because a small group of investors with large balances pull up the averages. Forty percent of participants had less than $20,000 in their retirement accounts.

Distribution of account balances

$20,000-$99,999 30%

$100,000-$249,900 15%

$250,000 + 15%

Source: Vanguard

Median balances for those near retirement are still low

A different way to look at the problem is to ask how much people who are retirement age have saved, because it's an indication of how prepared they are for imminent retirement.

Investors 65 years or older had an average account balance of $272,588, but a median balance of only $88,488.

A median balance of $88,488 is not much when you consider older participants have higher incomes and higher savings rates. That is not much money for a 65-year old nearing retirement.

Of course, these balances don't necessarily reflect total lifetime savings. Some have more than one retirement plan because they had other plans with previous employers. Most do have other sources of retirement savings, typically Social Security. A shrinking number may also have a pension. Some may have money in checking accounts, or have stocks or bonds outside a retirement account.

Regardless, the math does not look great

So let's do some retirement math.

A typical annual drawdown for a 401(k) account in retirement is about 4%. Drawing down 4% of $88,488 a year gets you $3,539 every 12 months.

Next, Social Security. As of January 2023, the average Social Security benefit was almost $1,689 per month, or about $20,268 per year.

Finally, even though pensions are a vanishing benefit, let's include them.

According to the Pension Rights Center, the median annual pension benefit for a private pension is $9,262 (government employees have higher benefits).

Here's our yearly retirement budget:

Personal savings $3,539

Pension $9,262

Social Security $20,264

Total: $33,065

It's certainly possibly to live on $33,000 a year, but this would likely only work if you own your home, have low expenses and live in a low-cost part of the country.

Even then, it would hardly be a robust retirement.

And these are the lucky ones. Only 57% of retirees have a tax-deferred retirement account like a 401(k) or IRA. Only 56% reported receiving income from a pension.

And that extra income largely determines whether a retiree feels good or bad about their retirement.

In 2023, four out five retirees said they were doing at least okay financially, but this varied tremendously depending on whether retirees had sources of income outside of Social Security. Only 52% of retirees who did not have private income said they were doing at least okay financially.

What can be done?

To have a more robust retirement, Americans are just going to have to save more.

One issue is investors still don't contribute the maximum amount allowed. Only 14% of participants saved the statutory maximum amount of $22,500 per year ($30,000 for those age 50 or older). The likely reason: most felt they couldn't afford to.

However, only 53% of even those with income over $150,000 contributed the maximum allowed. Given that the employee match is ""free money,"" one would think participants in that income bracket would rationally choose to max out their contribution. The fact that many still don't suggests that more investor education is needed.

Regardless, it's very dangerous to assume that retirees are going to be bailed out by an ever-rising stock market. Another year anywhere near 2022, when the S&P 500 was down 20%, and investor confidence in their financial future will likely deteriorate.","The bad news: account balances for the median 401(k) of a person approaching retirement (65+) remains very low.

Patrick Van Katwijk | Getty Images

AMSTERDAM — Europe is at risk of falling behind the U.S. and China on artificial intelligence as it focuses on regulating the technology, according to Prince Constantijn of the Netherlands. ""Our ambition seems to be limited to being good regulators,"" Constantijn told CNBC in an interview on the sidelines of the Money 20/20 fintech conference in Amsterdam earlier this month. Prince Constantijn is the third and youngest son of former Dutch Queen Beatrix and the younger brother of reigning Dutch King Willem-Alexander. He is special envoy of the Dutch startup accelerator Techleap, where he works to help local startups grow fast internationally by improving their access to capital, market, talent, and technologies. ""We've seen this in the data space [with GDPR], we've seen this now in the platform space, and now with the AI space,"" Constantijn added. European Union regulators have taken a tough approach to artificial intelligence, with formal regulations limiting how developers and companies can apply the technology in certain scenarios.

The bloc gave final approval to the EU AI Act, a ground-breaking AI law, last month. Officials are concerned by how quickly the technology is advancing and risks it poses around jobs displacement, privacy, and algorithmic bias. The law takes a risk-based approach to artificial intelligence, meaning that different applications of the tech are treated differently depending on their risk level. For generative AI applications, the EU AI Act sets out clear transparency requirements and copyright rules. All generative AI systems would have to make it possible to prevent illegal output, to disclose if content is produced by AI and to publish summaries of the copyrighted data used for training purposes. But the EU's Ai Act requires even stricter scrutiny for high-impact, general-purpose AI models that could pose ""systemic risk,"" such as OpenAI's GPT-4 — including thorough evaluations and compulsory reporting of any ""serious incidents."" Prince Constantijn said he's ""really concerned"" that the Europe's focus has been more on regulating AI than trying to become a leader innovating in the space. ""It's good to have guardrails.

DALIAN, China — For China's yuan to be used more globally, the currency needs more ""applications"" such as for stocks and bonds, Bonnie Chan, CEO of Hong Kong Exchanges and Clearing Limited, said on a panel Tuesday. Beijing has long touted its ambitions for increasing global use of the Chinese yuan — also known as the ""renminbi"" or ""RMB"" — in an international financial market where the U.S. dollar is the dominant currency. U.S. sanctions on Russia have also increased the pressure on some countries to have alternatives to the greenback. Chan, speaking during the World Economic Forum's ""Summer Davos"" meeting in Dalian, China, noted that people hold a currency for trade, or, more importantly, as a store of wealth. ""We're not just going to hold on to a bunch of RMB and put it into this bank account,"" she said. ""You want to have bonds, you want to have equities, etc."" ""One of our strategic imperatives [has] been changed to make sure that we continue to produce more RMB-denominated security products,"" Chan said, ""so that investors around the world can actually see more applications of the RMB and be able to use those as the medium to store wealth in the form of the RMB.""

Last year, the HKEX announced a ""Dual-Counter"" program that allows investors to trade Hong Kong-listed securities in Hong Kong dollars or Chinese yuan. In a significant step toward internationalization of the yuan, the International Monetary Fund in 2015 announced that it would add the yuan to its basket of reserve currencies the following year. The yuan was the fourth-most active currency for global payments by value in May, accounting for nearly 4.5% of such transactions, according to the interbank messaging network SWIFT. The U.S. dollar had a nearly 48% share. In trade finance, the yuan ranked third at about 5.1% in May, according to SWIFT. The euro was slightly higher at 5.6%, while the U.S. dollar dominated with a nearly 85% share, the data showed. Fred Hu, founder, chairman and CEO of Primavera Capital, said on the same panel Tuesday that the internationalization of the yuan is probably going to take longer than many expect, despite an increased amount of statements from Beijing. While China is the largest trading nation and has large financial centers, ""we're not as big, as deep as the U.S.,"" Hu said. ""Besides our capital account is also closed, it's not fully convertible, [which] also in some way [is] hampering the internationalization of the renminbi.""

A maturing financial market

Developing more Chinese yuan-denominated investment products also requires a maturation of the local financial sector. Part of that includes having a more sophisticated investor base. Chan said that during the annual Lujiazui Financial Forum in Shanghai last week, nearly every conversation with top leaders included the term ""patient investing."" The phrase has emerged in official releases to encourage long-term investing over short-term speculation. ""Patience comes from learning through the market volatility,"" Kenny Lam, CEO of Two Sigma Asia-Pacific, said during the same panel on Tuesday. He said that policymakers have been giving more thought to making their policies more stable and consistent.

Why life insurance purchases have 'steadily' fallen

Many Americans fail to plan for their mortality, neglecting to draft wills, put a power of attorney in place or designate beneficiaries for financial accounts. Overall, the share of households with life insurance has ""steadily"" decreased since the early 1970s, according to the ACLI. There are likely many reasons for that drop-off.

watch now

For one, younger generations are deferring big financial and life milestones such as getting married, buying a home and having kids relative to older generations. Each of these events generally acts as a key trigger to buy life insurance, experts said. Higher-costing homeownership and child care, coupled with rising debt burdens (for student loans, for example), may mean younger households are less willing or able to pay monthly insurance premiums, said Knoll, a senior financial planner at The Planning Center. Insurance costs themselves are also generally rising for consumers, Shapiro said. Additionally, life insurance is often not typically easy or quick to buy due to factors such as medical testing for underwriting, Shapiro said. ""It's a complex transaction,"" he said.

There are more benign factors at play, too: For instance, fewer consumers have sought out the tax benefits of certain life policies as other tax-advantaged savings options, such as 401(k) accounts and 529 plans, have come into existence, Knoll said. That said, even as fewer people buy life insurance, ""I do think there's a need for it,"" he added. Life insurance isn't necessarily right for everyone, though. Here are some key considerations.

When to buy life insurance

Consumers should consider their financial situation and the standard of living they want to maintain for survivors, such as dependents or spouses, according to the Illinois Department of Insurance. Absent a policyholder's income, there might be a financial shortfall in paying day-to-day household expenses, or for debts and big-ticket items such as tuition, for example. ""Who will be responsible for your funeral costs and final medical bills? Would your family have to relocate? Will there be adequate funds for future or ongoing expenses such as daycare, mortgage payments, or college?"" the department said in a consumer guide. Single people without kids may also have financial obligations, such as funeral expenses, medical bills, debts like credit cards or student loans, and financial support for elderly parents, the IDOI said.

What type of life insurance to buy

There are two broad types of life insurance: term and permanent. Term insurance will typically be best for most consumers, according to financial advisors. These policies last for a designated term, perhaps 10, 20 or 30 years. They generally carry fixed monthly premiums. The length of one's financial obligation is a good guide to the term one should choose, Shapiro said.

It's absolutely clear to me there's a very large gap here. Scott Shapiro U.S. insurance sector leader at KPMG

If a policyholder's spouse is 35 years old and the policyholder seeks a financial hedge until their spouse retires — perhaps at age 65 — the buyer might choose a term of 30 years, for example. Ensuring there's enough money for young kids to go to college might mean having a policy that lasts about 20 years. Permanent life insurance, such as a whole or universal life policy, is meant to last throughout life. It may make sense for consumers to pay for a lifelong policy if they want to leave a financial legacy for charities, or reasonably expect to develop a medical condition that can make it harder to get insurance later. Permanent insurance is generally more costly and complex than a term policy, advisors said. For example, it often carries an interest-bearing account in addition to the insurance component. Policyholders can build up cash value over time depending on factors such as dividends or investment returns. The cash value can have various uses: to pay insurance premiums, as collateral for a loan, or as cash in the event a buyer surrenders their policy in the future. However, there's a lot of fine print and consumers should avoid buying something they don't understand, advisors said.

CNBC,https://www.cnbc.com/2024/07/01/paramount-streaming-merger-talks.html,2024-07-01,20:57:17 UTC,"Paramount is hunting for a streaming partner, could kick off a wave of deals","Paramount Global is holding talks with other entertainment companies about merging its Paramount+ streaming service with an existing platform. If it reaches a deal, it may kick off a new wave of streaming partnerships that could put the entire media industry on firmer footing.

Paramount Global leadership is having active discussions with other media and tech company executives to determine if a structure makes sense for both parties where Paramount+ can be merged with another streaming entity and potentially co-owned, according to people familiar with the matter, who asked not to be named because the discussions are private.

One of the companies that has expressed a desire to reach a deal is Warner Bros. Discovery , according to people familiar with the matter. Combining Max and Paramount+ could strengthen both services by allowing them to better compete with Netflix and Disney's suite of platforms (Disney+, Hulu and ESPN) for eyeballs and future content.

Warner Bros. Discovery held preliminary merger talks for a deal for all of Paramount Global earlier this year, but talks didn't escalate.

Paramount Global is also considering partnering with a technology platform, the company's co-CEO Chris McCarthy said at an employee town hall on June 25.

""What they don't have is our scale of content, and together we will make for a very powerful combination to drive more minutes and greater profits,"" McCarthy said of a potential tech partner at the town hall, according to a transcript of the event obtained by CNBC.

A merged streaming service would mitigate churn by giving customers more diverse programming and fewer reasons to cancel each month, and it could take Paramount+ losses off Paramount Global's balance sheet by giving it new ownership.

While a structure for a hypothetical joint venture with Warner Bros. Discovery hasn't been discussed in detail, ownership likely wouldn't be a 50-50 split given the existing natures of the streaming assets and their finances, according to people familiar with the discussions.

Warner Bros. Discovery's direct-to-consumer business made $103 million in annual adjusted EBITDA in 2023 after losing $2.1 billion the year before. Paramount Global reported a loss of $1.67 billion in direct-to-consumer operating income before depreciation and amortization in 2023, narrower than its $1.8 billion loss a year prior.

Max has about 100 million global subscribers, with 52.7 million based in the U.S. Paramount+ ended its first quarter with 71 million subscribers.

Comcast's NBCUniversal has also expressed interest in a joint venture with Paramount+, as The Wall Street Journal first reported earlier this year. The talks didn't progress and never got particularly far, according to people familiar with the matter.

""The sheer volume of hit content that we could offer together would be tremendous across TV, film and sports, and would attract millions of viewers,"" McCarthy said during the town hall in reference to a potential partnership with an existing subscription streaming service like Max or Peacock. ""Plus, we would share in all other non-content expenses.""

Starbucks cafes across the country are starting to change how they make drink orders, among other tweaks designed to reduce bottlenecks and long wait times that have dogged the chain. The overhaul comes as the coffee giant prepares for an anticipated swell of orders through its mobile app. At the heart of the plan is Starbucks' ""Siren Craft System,"" a series of processes that are aimed at making baristas' jobs easier and speeding up service times for customers. Starbucks said more than 10% of its 10,000 stores have already implemented the system, which includes changing the production order for hot and cold drinks. It will be in use across North America by the end of July, according to the company. Executives hope the changes will provide a much-needed jolt to Starbucks. In April, the company reported a disappointing second quarter, as U.S. same-store sales fell 3% and traffic dropped 7%. The coffee chain cut its 2024 outlook. Starbucks reported rates of incomplete mobile app orders in the mid-teens and said occasional customers came in less. CEO Laxman Narasimhan mentioned the need to make improvements to stores. Katie Young, senior vice president of store operations at Starbucks, said the most immediate shift that needed to happen in cafes was better handling the unexpected. ""It's the ability to flexibly respond to things we cannot predict,"" she told CNBC in an interview.

The store changes will be key this month, as Starbucks on Monday started opening up its app to non-rewards members, which the company believes will increase traffic and orders. Analyst Peter Saleh, managing director at BTIG, said, ""My sense is that they have a lot of demand in certain stores, and the footprint of the kitchen is so small, you have to find ways to be more efficient."" Losing customers because of slow orders and other store frustrations could cost Starbucks at a particularly vulnerable time. Americans have become cost conscious in the face of ongoing inflation, and in some cases have pulled back on morning or afternoon beverages and snacks. Narasimhan in April said consumers are spending more cautiously. Starbucks has done something uncharacteristic in recent weeks, joining the stream of value offerings with a $5 food and beverage combo option. Communicating value to customers is also part of the plan to drum up business.

The Siren system

Starbucks has been diagnosing the bottleneck issue for more than a year, since the company's reinvention plan rollout in 2022, said Young. At the time, Howard Schultz was at the helm, having returned during a burgeoning unionization movement and shifts in consumer preferences. The changes underway in cafes were first previewed that fall, to be rolled out in the years to come. Narasimhan took over for Schultz in March 2023. The Siren system processes were developed with worker feedback on which issues stopped them from creating beverages and connecting with customers. Starbucks said it plans to add a role akin to an expediter in a restaurant production line, a ""play caller"" who steps away from production and helps solve logjams in cafes, handling tasks such as restocking cups or helping when an unexpected crowd arrives. The company plans to train existing workers for the role or potentially add new baristas, if needed. ""One of the pain points we saw was [that] our espresso machine was often running all the time, and that was one of the things that kept our partners from being able to check in. And another thing we saw that you didn't necessarily know was which part of the store would get crowded,"" Young said. ""We needed to actually have a partner that was dedicated when things got busy to pulling out of production and just helping."" Starbucks said it will also change the order in which beverages are made. Previously, cold drinks were prioritized from start to finish, even if a hot beverage order came in first, as pulling espresso shots was the last step. This could create a traffic jam in the drive-thru, for example, if a person ordered one of each beverage, as the cold item would be ready while the hot drink was still in production. Macoy McLaughlin, manager of Seattle's First and Walker Starbucks location, said producing beverages in the order they were placed allows for a faster, streamlined process. ""We actually have proper sequencing between our hot and cold bars, versus cold bars becoming as popular as ever, to really have a consistent experience for the customers. So we're actually making them in the order they're coming in,"" McLaughlin said, adding that the cafe feels busier, but customers in store and in the drive-thru are getting drinks faster. Baristas also will have more control over the company's digital production manager, an iPad system that controls the sequencing of orders in various channels from cafes, mobile orders and the drive-thru, the company said. Workers will have more flexibility over changing order priority.

It said it agreed to pay $37.25 a share in Boeing stock for Spirit, giving the aerospace company an equity value of $4.7 billion. Including Spirit's debt the deal has a transaction value of $8.3 billion Boeing said. Spirit's shares closed Friday at $32.87 a share, giving it a market capitalization of about $3.8 billion.

Boeing in March disclosed it was in talks to acquire the Wichita, Kansas-based company, weeks after a fuselage panel blew out midair from a nearly new Boeing 737 Max 9 on an Alaska Airlines flight, sparking a fresh crisis for Boeing. Spirit makes the fuselages for the 737 and other parts, including sections of Boeing's 787 Dreamliners.

In 2005, Boeing spun off operations in Kansas and Oklahoma that became the present-day Spirit AeroSystems. Boeing accounted for about 70% of Spirit's revenue last year, while roughly a quarter came from making parts for Boeing's main rival, Airbus, according to a securities filing.

Boeing CEO Dave Calhoun, who has said he will step down at the end of the year, on Monday said bringing Spirit in-house will ""fully align"" the companies' production systems and workforces.

""Among the many actions we're taking as a company, this is one of the most significant in demonstrating our unwavering commitment to strengthen quality and make certain that Boeing is the company the world needs it to be,"" Calhoun said in a message to employees.

He said he expects the deal to close mid-2025, subject to approval by regulators, Spirit shareholders and the sale of Spirit's operations dedicated to Airbus planes.

Spirit's CEO, Pat Shanahan, is considered a possible successor for Calhoun.

Airbus, meanwhile, said Monday it has reached an agreement with Spirit so that the European aircraft manufacturer is compensated $559 million by Spirit to acquire its manufacturing lines dedicated to Airbus planes. Those include operations in Belfast, Northern Ireland, where the wings and mid-fuselage of the A220 are produced, A220 pylons in Wichita and A350 fuselage sections in North Carolina.","Boeing said Monday that it will buy back its struggling fuselage maker Spirit AeroSystems in an all-stock deal that the plane maker has said will improve safety and quality control.

Boeing declined to comment, and it wasn't immediately clear if it would accept a plea deal. A guilty plea could complicate its ability to get government contracts. Boeing is a major defense contractor.

The Justice Department didn't immediately respond to a request for comment.

The DOJ said in May that it was reviewing whether Boeing violated a 2021 settlement that protected the company from federal charges tied to the 2018 and 2019 crashes of its best-selling 737 Max planes, which killed all 346 people on the two flights. Under that agreement, Boeing said it would pay $2.5 billion.

The DOJ revisited the agreement after a door panel blew out of a new 737 Max 9 midair during an Alaska Airlines flight in January, sparking a new safety and quality control crisis for one of the world's two suppliers of large commercial airplanes. The so-called deferred prosecution agreement was set to expire days before the door panel blew out.

Boeing admitted in 2021 that two of its pilots defrauded the Federal Aviation Administration by concealing its addition of a new flight-control system to the planes before they were flown commercially. That system was later implicated in the two crashes.

The plea deal would require Boeing to pay an additional fine of about $247 million and call for the installation of an outside monitor on Boeing, according to Paul Cassell, one of the lawyers. Cassell called the new deal a ""slap on the wrist.""","U.S. prosecutors plan to seek a guilty plea from Boeing over a charge tied to two fatal crashes of 737 Max planes, attorneys for the victims' family members said Sunday, blasting a potential agreement as a ""sweetheart deal.""

Disney and Pixar's ""Inside Out 2"" is the newest member of the billion-dollar club.

The animated feature has tallied $1.014 billion worldwide as of Sunday, making it the highest-grossing film of 2024 and the first film since Warner Bros.′ ""Barbie"" to top $1 billion at the global box office.

""On behalf of movie theatre owners across the country and around the world, we want to congratulate Disney's 'Inside Out 2' for grossing $1 billion faster than any animated movie in history,"" said Michael O'Leary, president and CEO of the National Association of Theatre Owners. ""The film's stunning global success once again illustrates that audiences the world over will respond to compelling, entertaining movies, and that they want to enjoy them on the big screen.""

The billion-dollar benchmark is a much-needed win for Disney's Pixar animation hub. A once prolifically successful studio, Pixar has suffered at the box office in the wake of the pandemic. Much of its difficulties have come, in part, because Disney opted to debut a handful of animated features directly on streaming service Disney+ during theatrical closures and even once cinemas had reopened.

As a result, before ""Inside Out 2,"" no Disney animated feature from Pixar or its Walt Disney Animation studio had generated more than $480 million at the global box office since 2019.

""Inside Out 2"" has also showcased how vital the family audience is to the box office. This underserved crowd accounted for more than 70% of those in attendance during the film's domestic debut, according to data from EntTelligence.

While this audience came out in droves for Universal's ""The Super Mario Bros. Movie,"" which generated more than $1.36 billion at the global box office, there was little for them to feast on until the recent releases of Sony's ""The Garfield Movie"" and Paramount's ""IF.""

""Inside Out 2"" also drove the coveted teen demographic to cinemas, with 14% of foot traffic coming from those aged 13 to 17. This younger generation has been largely absent from the market in recent years.

As the future of moviegoing, this group is particularly important to the industry. Getting them back to the big screen has become a top priority for studios and movie theater operators.

Next up for family and teens is Universal and Illumination's ""Despicable Me 4,"" due out in theaters during the July Fourth holiday weekend.

Pride month is winding down — and this year, the corporate world took a more cautious approach. June tends to bring a wave of rainbow-themed merchandise and affirming ads and social media posts from retailers and consumers brands, coinciding with parades and other events that celebrate the LGBTQ+ community. As the presidential election approaches, however, some companies have grown quieter about diversity, equity and inclusion efforts to avoid stepping into the culture wars or facing the blowback from conservative customers that Target and Bud Light did a year ago. The starkest example of that came late Thursday: Tractor Supply, a retailer that sells animal feed, cowboy boots and lawn supplies in rural parts of the country, said it is ending all spending tied to diversity and environmental causes. That includes no longer sponsoring Pride festivals, the statement said. The move, while an outlier in its magnitude, underscores how some companies that made inclusion commitments in recent years are treading cautiously. It is difficult to track how many companies shared supportive messages, donated to LGBTQ+ causes or sold rainbow-themed merchandise in June compared to previous years. According to Gravity Research, a Washington, D.C.-based reputational research firm, 45% of Fortune 100 companies had at least one social media post on LinkedIn or X explicitly related to Pride as of June 21 this year, compared with 51% last June. Gravity Research President Luke Hartig said the volatility of the presidential election and the two candidates' willingness to call out companies by name has also made companies less likely to go public about their stand. ""There's a little bit of like, 'keep our heads down while we go through this election,'"" he said. Tim Bennett, cofounder of Tribury Productions, a marketing company that specializes in reaching LGBTQ+ Americans, works with Fortune 500 companies, including recent projects with Procter & Gamble. He said more clients have taken ""a wait-and-see"" approach to marketing to LGBTQ+ consumers or decided to scatter efforts throughout the year instead of making a big splash in a single month. ""June this year has not been like the last five or six,"" Bennett said. That may not be a bad thing for LGBTQ+ initiatives and charities. Sarah Kate Ellis, CEO of nonprofit advocacy group GLAAD, said she's seeing more companies get involved with year-round philanthropy and activism in more meaningful ways. She also pointed to a survey by Gravity Research that found that 78% of companies did not plan to change their Pride strategy this year. Thirteen percent were unsure whether they'd make changes and 9% said they planned to revise their strategy. Gravity Research surveyed 45 corporate executives and Fortune 500 leaders across industries in April. ""The visibility of companies putting flags out and having product to celebrate our Pride and to mark a month that's really significant and important for our community is really important, and I don't want to ever devalue that,"" Ellis said. ""I do think, though, those companies must look inside and make sure that they have the policies and the HR practices that match their outward marketing."" Major companies are still writing checks for LGBTQ+ causes, too. A GLAAD spokesperson said Friday that the group has not seen donations or corporate support decline this Pride month, though it does not yet have a total tally. On Friday, when the Stonewall National Monument Visitor Center officially opened its doors to commemorate the New York City bar that was a catalyst in the LGBTQ+ rights movement, the event had major backing from the business community. Supporters included Google, Amazon, JPMorgan Chase and Booking.com. President Joe Biden also made an appearance and remarks at the monument's opening.

The Bud Light and Target effect

Consumer staples brands were the most likely to say they planned to shift their Pride month strategy this year, according to Gravity Research's survey. That may stem from the conservative boycotts of Target and Bud Light last year. Target has carried a Pride collection for over a decade. Yet last year, the big-box retailer removed some items and moved displays after employees faced threats. Boycotters targeted items for transgender shoppers, such as ""tuck-friendly"" swimsuits, and also criticized separate Pride merchandise for kids. Instead of putting Pride merchandise in all stores this year, Target only carried it in the locations that accounted for 90% of total Pride sales in 2022 and 2023. It also stopped selling any Pride apparel for kids. On the company's website and in those select stores, shoppers can find a wide variety of Pride-themed items. The volume of negative feedback to the Pride collection externally and internally is ""significantly lower"" this year than in 2023, according to a Target spokesperson. In a statement, Target said it is ""committed to supporting the LGBTQIA+ community during Pride Month and year-round"" and would participate in Pride events across the country and support LGBTQ+ groups, in addition to offering Pride products.

Anheuser-Busch InBev and other large beer brands, on the other hand, have backed away from public support of the LGBTQ+ community. Conservatives like singer Kid Rock and Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis called for a boycott of the beer and its parent company, Anheuser-Busch InBev, after Bud Light sent personalized cans of its beer to transgender influencer Dylan Mulvaney. The marketing campaign coincided with the March Madness college basketball tournament. Bud Light sales tumbled around 25%, and the brand lost its spot as the best-selling beer in the U.S., ceding the position it held for more than two decades to Constellation Brands' Modelo. AB InBev distanced itself from Mulvaney and fired Bud Light's vice president of marketing. In October, AB InBev CEO Michel Doukeris said the brand would focus its marketing more on events like sports games and concerts. It also returned as the official sponsor of the UFC. In recent months, some consumers have returned to Bud Light, as RBC Europe analysts estimate that the brand's U.S. volume is down only about 10% these days. For its part, Bud Light hasn't posted in support of Pride month on its Instagram or X pages this year. The boycott was unusually sticky for a few reasons, according to Neil Reid, a geography professor at the University of Toledo who researches the beer industry. Studies have shown that consumers' loyalty to top-selling beers may be more tied to the brand than the taste, Reid said. Right-wing news outlets like Fox News also devoted plenty of airtime to the controversy, stretching its duration and potentially reaching new consumers who missed the initial reaction. Plus, once Bud Light sales fell, retailers gave more shelf space to its rivals. ""You can look at this issue from a moral, ethical perspective or you can also look at it from a pure business perspective. Those two often don't result in the same strategy,"" Reid said.

For 20 years, the joint venture between AMC , Regal and Cinemark has been best known for bringing alternative content to the big screen in the form of classic Hollywood titles, live telecasts of theater and opera productions, concerts and even television series.

Most recently, it ventured into the specialty distribution space to deliver ""The Blind,"" ""The Chosen,"" ""Jesus Thirsts: The Miracle of the Eucharist"" and ""Waitress: the Musical"" to audiences. Still to come is ""Andrea Bocelli 30: The Celebration.""

In 2023, Fathom generated $100 million at the box office, a 116% increase over 2019 levels and its highest-grossing year ever. And that momentum has continued into 2024, as the company tallied $43 million in the first quarter, up nearly 140% compared to the $18 million it tallied in the year-earlier period.

Fathom's relationships with Hollywood's biggest studios and its cinematic reach — as the partnership of the industry's three biggest theater chains — has made it a formidable force at the box office. Its value proposition is twofold: It breathes new life into older films, and into theaters.

""Falling mostly under the event film banner, anniversary titles have truly come into vogue seemingly more so now than in years past with a particular emphasis given to these beloved older films,"" said Paul Dergarabedian, senior media analyst at Comscore. ""These anniversary re-releases are a win-win, providing joy to movie fans and notably additional revenues to movie theaters often decades after initial theatrical run.""

In post-pandemic times, Fathom has acted as a crutch for many smaller cinema operators, providing much-needed content for the big screen amid a drought caused by pandemic and strike-related production shutdowns.

Season 4 of ""The Chosen,"" a faith-based television show about the life of Jesus, generated $32 million at the box office for Fathom, around 75% of its first-quarter haul.

""'The Chosen' was through [Fathom], and it was huge for us,"" said Brock Bagby, president and chief content, programming and development officer at B&B Theatres. ""It gave us a lot of extra revenue in February and the beginning of March that we wouldn't have had.""

Fathom has also benefited from its anniversary titles and classic cinema showings. Each year, the company brings films back to theaters to celebrate milestone years alongside fan-favorite titles.

""We've seen that there's a growing segment in the box office, people that are interested in seeing older films on the big screen,"" said Jordan Hohman, vice president of project development at Phoenix Theatres. ""These audiences are getting to enjoy classic films, either for the first time or for the first time, in a new way. I think that that's valuable.""

This year, the company celebrated the 85th anniversaries of ""The Wizard of Oz"" and ""Gone with the Wind"" as well as the 35th anniversary of ""Steel Magnolias."" Still on the calendar is the 50th anniversary of ""Blazing Saddles,"" the 70th anniversary of Alfred Hitchcock's ""Rear Window,"" the 40th anniversary of ""Neverending Story"" and the 20th anniversary of ""Mean Girls.""

It also has a film series called Studio Ghibli Fest, which features 14 films from the studio in their original Japanese and English dubbed versions. This year, the lineup boasts the 20th anniversary of ""Howl's Moving Castle,"" the 35th anniversary of ""Kiki's Delivery Service"" and the 30th anniversary of ""Pom Poko.""

And these titles can generate big box-office hauls even decades after they were first released.

Fathom's three-weekend run of the original Lord of the Rings trilogy resulted in $8.2 million at the box office.

""Lord of the Rings was wildly successful nationwide, and for us,"" Bagby said. ""We just did 4DX Lord of the Rings this weekend in our new Dallas theater, and we sold out every single show.""

4DX is a screen format that utilizes motion seats, practical effects and sensory elements to immerse viewers in a movie experience.

Audiences are already buying tickets for showings in August celebrating the 15th anniversary of ""Coraline,"" which will be shown widely in 3D for the first time since its original release.

Fathom re-released ""Coraline"" twice before with great success. In 2022, the film showed in 800 theaters for one day and tallied $1.2 million in ticket sales. Last year, the film extended its release to five days and snared $7.1 million, making it the highest-grossing classic film release in Fathom history.

That $7.1 million figure is about 10% of the initial domestic run for ""Coraline"" in 2009 and 42% of its opening weekend, according to data from Comscore.

What's more, 53% of the audience who attended screenings of the film last year were 34 years old or younger.

""New audiences are seeing it for the first time although the film is 15 years old,"" said Ray Nutt, CEO of Fathom Events.

Fathom reports presales for this year's screenings of ""Coraline"" are selling seven times as many tickets per location as were sold during the same period last year, with two-thirds of those ticket sales for the 3D version of the film.

Because Fathom has a wide footprint through its parent companies and nationwide marketing, it does the heavy lifting for smaller theater chains.

""[Fathom has] built a lot of relationships,"" Phoenix Theatre's Hohman said. ""They worked out the licensing and they created the marketing behind re-releasing these classic films that, you know, we just can't do ourselves. It's a national campaign. So, I think that they just offer a lot of value.""","At a time when the box office is starved for content and audiences seem pickier than ever, Fathom Events is posting record revenue gains.

DETROIT — Purchasing a vehicle has never been that easy. But shoppers entering traditional dealer showrooms for the foreseeable future may have a new challenge: An alphabet soup of ""electrified"" vehicle offerings. As all-electric vehicle adoption crawls along in the U.S., automakers are increasingly releasing various hybrid vehicles as alternative options to EVs and traditional gas-powered engines. A variety of models means more customer choice, but also more complexity for automakers and consumers, many of whom are returning to the new vehicle market for the first time in years following unprecedented supply chain shortages and record used vehicle prices. ""More choice in the marketplace is good for consumers, but only if they understand the differences,"" said Paul Waatti, director of industry analysis at AutoPacific. ""There needs to be more clarity on what the terms and acronyms actually mean, and what the potential benefits and drawbacks are."" A car shopper today has their pick of traditional internal combustion engine (ICE) vehicles; mild-hybrid electric vehicles (MHEVs); hybrid electric vehicles (HEVs); plug-in hybrid electric vehicles (PHEVs); fuel cell electric vehicles (FCEVs) and battery-electric vehicles (BEVs), also commonly known as EVs. Also coming later this year from Stellantis : range-extended electric vehicles (REEVs) that are similar to plug-in hybrid vehicles but can exclusively function as an EV, with its electric motors powered by a gas engine. Each type of vehicle may be better for a different kind of customer. All except EVs and fuel-cell vehicles continue to offer a traditional internal combustion engine combined with ""electrified"" technologies such as a battery or motor to assist in performance or fuel economy. Heather Seymour, of St. Johns, Florida, said she did quite a bit of research prior to purchasing a 2022 Jeep Wrangler Rubicon plug-in hybrid electric vehicle, known as a 4xe model. ""I knew I wanted to kind of dip my toe in the water of the hybrids. I wasn't ready to go full electric, so the plug-in was definitely of interest to me,"" said Seymour, who said she typically uses the all-electric range of the SUV, except on longer trips. ""The more we learned about it, the more we figured out what we wanted.""

EV naming

While consumers may not need to know every acronym or technology to find their right model, automakers aren't exactly helping the situation with their consumer-facing naming. For example, Hyundai's Genesis brand calls its all-electric vehicles ""electrified,"" while many others reserve that term for hybrids. Chrysler's Pacifica minivan is a plug-in hybrid labeled as a regular ""hybrid,"" and Toyota markets some of its traditional hybrids as ""hybrid EVs."" Stellantis says its REEV vehicles are not PHEVs, despite operating similarly. ""Every automaker is using different terms. There's no standardization, and that causes some confusion on the consumer side,"" Waatti said.

Some automakers such as General Motors also use traditional nameplates such as the Chevrolet Blazer and Equinox for new EVs that share little to nothing with their gas-powered counterparts other than the name. Stellantis' Jeep also uses the ""Wagoneer"" moniker for two large gas-powered SUVs as well as a smaller, all-electric Wagoneer ""S"" SUV. Jeep CEO Antonio Filosa has said he isn't worried about any confusion, as the brand has a strong naming heritage and customers can decide which vehicle is best for their needs. ""I believe that we need education, but after education we have a lot of choices for the consumer,"" he said during a recent interview. ""It's all for the benefit of the consumer. They will have a lot of flexibility.""

Education is key

One thing automotive executives from Japan and South Korea to Detroit and Germany can agree on is the need for consumer education. Whether vehicles are electrified or all-electric, they're critical for automakers to meet tightening emissions and fuel economy targets as well as to build production scale, reduce prices and increase profits. ""We don't want to force a customer to do something they're not ready for,"" Kia America VP of Marketing Russell Wager told CNBC earlier this year. ""We're trying our best to educate them.""

Kia and its dealers have put out myth-busting pages online to answer concerns or frequently asked questions about EVs and hybrids. They range from technical questions about batteries to practical questions like whether you can go through a car wash in an EV (you can). GM has taken it a step further. The Detroit automaker launched ""EV Live"" in 2022. It's an online video platform, now known as ""GM Energy Live,"" that allows participants to interact one-on-one with EV specialists and learn about electric vehicles and charging. Ford Motor recently launched its own video-based training program, geared toward its more than 3,000 U.S. franchised dealers to improve customer service, better engage employees and provide dealers and the company with more data to help in selling the vehicles. Auto executives say it's up to the companies as well as their dealers to be trained and educated about the benefits of the vehicles, whatever they may be. ""Each customer, in the end, is very different,"" said Jérémie Papin, chair of Nissan Americas, earlier this year. ""I think it's what the vehicle can do for them,"" not necessarily how the technology works, he said.

They typically allow drivers to travel a certain number of miles using the battery before the engine is needed to power the car or truck.

Range-extended electric vehicles (REEV): These are an emerging technology that largely function as a PHEV, however after the battery runs out of energy to power the vehicle, an engine works as a generator to exclusively power electric motors. The vehicle still drives like an EV instead of having the engine directly power the vehicle's motion.

More than 2,400 companies exhibited their foods and drinks for attendees, which include restaurant operators, specialty food retailers and trendspotters. Past show trends that are making their way to mainstream consumers' palettes include yuzu, mushrooms and sophisticated alcohol substitutes. Previous shows have also been a springboard for small brands seeking a wider audience. Honest Tea, Ben & Jerry's and Tate's Bake Shop are among the companies that attended the show in their early days on their way to becoming well-known consumer brands now owned by the industry's biggest players. Here are some highlights from this year's Summer Fancy Food Show:

Honey — as a flavor

Humans have been eating honey for thousands of years, but it's taking center stage as a flavor with some food and beverage makers. In the SFA's preliminary report on the show, its trendspotters called out honey, noting its health benefits. Honey was the star in both foods and drinks across the show. Green Bee showed off its honey soda, which includes a Honeycomb Cider flavor. Owl Creek Organics & Natural Flavors displayed honey spreads, with flavors ranging from caffe mocha to lemon poppyseed. And Dutch company Klepper & Klepper used honey as a flavor for their licorice.

Tinned fish

In years past, tinned fish was relegated primarily to booths in the Spanish and Portuguese pavilions. But this year, exhibitors showed off their tinned fish products across the show floor. TikTok helped fuel the tinned fish trend last year, boosting sales of canned sardines. Now specialty food companies are responding. This isn't the canned tuna of yore. There are more flavors, different seafood varieties and trendier packaging. Wildfish Cannery, an Alaska-based company that was founded in 1987, showed off a new retro design for its sockeye salmon, giving it a more upscale feel. Krill Arctic Foods exhibited its canned krill meat, which may lack the same curb appeal on its packaging but boasts about the food's nutritional profile.

Fish to go

Exhibitors also showed off new ways to eat fish on the go, hoping to capitalize on consumers' desire for convenience and more protein in their diets. The association named ""satisfying snacks"" as one of the trends that it's been watching. Acme Smoked Fish highlighted its new Lox in a Box snack kits, available with cream cheese or avocado. Legend of Master International, an Asian food supplier, sampled its Kani fish cake sticks, made to eat like string cheese or for cooking.

Upgraded charcuterie

Like tinned fish, the popularity of charcuterie boards owes a lot to social media, where users can dazzle their followers with elaborate displays of preserved meats, cheeses and fruit. Companies at the Summer Fancy Food Show showed off some new options to level up the charcuterie — especially the salami. Tempesta Artisan Salumi offered up black truffle-flavored salami, while Salt & Twine's selection included a mezcal and salted lime flavor. But exhibitors weren't just having fun with the flavors. Some are looking beyond pork to make the cured meat. Driftless Provisions' salami uses elk, venison and bison alongside pork. Fossil Farms' salami lineup included lamb and wagyu beef.

There's an army of unsponsored athletes commanding attention at the U.S. Track & Field Olympic Trials this year, decked out in all-black, logo-less gear.

The 35 athletes are supported by apparel company Bandit Running's Unsponsored Project, an effort to challenge the standard sponsorship model for professional athletes and boost up-and-coming competitors.

Unsponsored athletes in track and field would typically purchase their own apparel bearing the emblems of major brands, effectively providing free advertising for the companies. Instead, Bandit Running offers Olympic hopefuls the all-black kits and warmups — along with short-term endorsement deals.

Bandit co-founder Tim West said the company is giving out at least 35 two-week deals for unsponsored runners at the trials, a U.S. Olympian's gateway into the four-year games. The deals consist of unbranded apparel, a platform and cash to cover expenses. Last year, Bandit partnered with nine athletes.

""We're really hoping for a new sponsorship model where brands take a healthy piece of their budget and apply it to the kind of amateur, sub-elite athlete to help grow the sport. I think when you lift up, sort of the bottom, everything pushes up,"" West told CNBC.

Bandit's deals have a built-in release clause, West said, allowing an easy out for athletes who get a traditional sponsorship offer during the trials.

Given the high prices associated with competing, West said unsponsored athletes are ""investing in themselves,"" posing an opportunity for brands to step in and help out.

And, the all-black, logo-free kits help call attention to which athletes may be available to strike a longer-term deal.

Among them is Courtney Okolo, a 400-meter runner.

After winning a gold medal in the 2016 Rio Olympics and being sponsored by Nike for four years, Okolo, 30, is embracing the Unsponsored Project. She said getting support while competing without a sponsorship is difficult, but Bandit's initiative makes it feel like she isn't doing it all on her own.","Christopher Royster, left, and JT Smith, athletes who participate in Bandit Running's Unsponsored Project, at the 2024 Olympic trials in Eugene, Oregon.

Pfizer had a ""phenomenal"" first quarter — and Wall Street took notice, CEO Albert Bourla told thousands of employees during a companywide town hall on May 2, according to a recording heard by CNBC. A day earlier, the pharmaceutical giant's stock had closed 6% higher after its quarterly results topped analyst estimates and it hiked its full-year outlook. It was a far cry from the year prior, when Pfizer's shares plunged more than 40%, making it one of the worst-performing large pharmaceutical stocks of 2023. Its market cap of about $157 billion is now less than half of its 2021 peak of nearly $350 billion. Few companies benefited from the pandemic as much as Pfizer did. The drugmaker's profits boomed, fueled by its Covid vaccine and antiviral pill Paxlovid. After Pfizer and German company BioNTech rapidly developed and deployed a lifesaving shot that helped the world emerge from the pandemic, Pfizer drew widespread praise. Pfizer's success contributed to its equally jarring fall from grace. When the virus receded in 2023, its Covid products revenue plummeted. The world, which hailed Pfizer as a pandemic hero a few years earlier, no longer needed the company in the same way. Pfizer may be on its way toward stabilizing its business and winning back Wall Street's favor after the strong first quarter. But the company is struggling to balance that with the fears of its employees, some of whom said they feel uncertain about their future and unmotivated after the sudden reversal of fortune. In October Pfizer launched a multibillion-dollar cost-cutting program, slashing research and development spending and laying off hundreds of employees — including in the once-lauded Covid vaccine unit. In May the company said it's on track to deliver $4 billion in savings by the end of the year.

Stock Chart Icon Stock chart icon Pfizer's stock surged after it rolled out its Covid vaccine and antiviral treatment, then plunged when the company's Covid revenue started to drop.

Now, as Pfizer appears poised to turn a corner, the company is trying to boost employee morale to match Wall Street's optimism. CNBC spoke with 11 current and former Pfizer employees — all of whom asked to remain anonymous for fear of retaliation — about Pfizer's dizzying climb, rapid decline and turnaround strategy. The company's seesawing fortunes have fueled uncertainty within Pfizer's workforce. Most of the current and former employees CNBC spoke with called Pfizer a good place to work, and some current employees said they feel optimistic about the direction of the company after the first quarter. But other current employees are dissatisfied with where the strategy shift has left them. Some cited higher workloads after teams were stretched thin by budget cuts, a return-to-office policy they said has forced out some remote workers, and doubts about how the business will perform moving forward. The company's separate multiyear cost-cutting program announced in May is also stoking fears about the potential for new U.S. layoffs, according to some current workers. Some employees working in certain manufacturing and supply chain divisions, which they believe are likely to be affected by the cuts, described having low morale and motivation to work. Meanwhile, several former Pfizer employees, most of whom were laid off over the last six months or left voluntarily, said they're unhappy with how the company handled cost cuts in 2023. Some alleged that Pfizer management provided little transparency around the layoffs and seemed more focused on the company's stock performance than its staff throughout the process. During the latest town hall, Bourla told employees that layoffs in the U.S. have been completed but that more are occurring internationally. He called the job cuts ""very, very painful"" and said it was ""killing"" him to let employees go. But he also acknowledged that Wall Street likes the cuts. ""And, of course, I'm very concerned with everyone that could be affected and impacted by that, but it works,"" Bourla said, according to the recording. ""And we saw it, how the Street will respond."" A Pfizer spokesperson said reducing costs will ""put us on strong footing towards margin expansion and improved financial returns moving forward."" The spokesperson added that cutting expenses is one of Pfizer's five priorities for the year, along with maximizing the performance of new products, innovating its drug pipeline, growing its oncology business with its acquisition of cancer drugmaker Seagen, and allocating capital to increase its dividend, reduce outstanding debt and reinvest in the business. To cut costs, apart from layoffs the company is trimming its drug portfolio and direct marketing spending, shrinking its real estate footprint and reducing its investment in Covid, among other efforts, said the spokesperson. The spokesperson said Pfizer does not take the layoffs ""lightly"" and that the company is ""focused on providing our impacted colleagues with the resources and compassion they deserve.""

What went wrong in 2023

Pfizer entered 2023 on a high. The company had just capped a record-breaking 2022 with $100 billion in sales, more than half of which came from its Covid vaccines and Paxlovid. Employee morale at Pfizer was relatively high at the time, some current and former workers told CNBC. The company had gone on a hiring spree and piled money into different projects, they said. The success came with trade-offs. Two former employees involved in developing the Covid vaccine manufacturing process said they were experiencing burnout at the start of 2023. In January 2023, Pfizer forecast a steep drop in annual revenue, to between $67 billion and $71 billion. That outlook included $13.5 billion and $8 billion in sales of Covid vaccines and Paxlovid, respectively. But it could not predict at the time just how much revenue would dry up.

During an earnings call that same month, Pfizer executives said they expected roughly 24% of the U.S. population to get an annual Covid booster in 2023. But by December, only around 17% of U.S. adults had received the new Covid shots from Pfizer and Moderna, according to data from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Many Americans who got previous Covid shots felt they did not need more protection because the threat of the virus had diminished, according to recent surveys. Meanwhile, use of Paxlovid in the U.S. was dented by reductions in Covid testing and infection rates, and by doctors' concerns about interactions with common medications, among other factors. As demand plummeted, the federal government returned millions of the antiviral treatment courses to Pfizer. In January this year, however, Pfizer said fewer courses were returned by the end of 2023 than it had expected. The company soon acknowledged the challenges its Covid business faced towards the end of 2023. In October, Pfizer said it slashed both ends of its 2023 sales guidance by around $9 billion ""solely due to its Covid products."" At the same time, Pfizer started to cut costs. The company still hasn't said how many employees it laid off, though it reduced staff around the world. Pfizer's 2023 revenue ultimately came in at $58.5 billion, including $11.22 billion from its Covid vaccine and $1.28 billion from Paxlovid. The end of the year brought other challenges for Pfizer: The company scrapped the twice-daily version of its experimental weight loss drug, danuglipron, and saw slower uptake for a newly launched RSV vaccine in the U.S. than competitor GSK saw with its own version. After the string of difficulties, investors showed relief when Pfizer announced the cost cuts. But for many employees, the shift in post-pandemic strategy was a nightmare, they told CNBC. During a conference in January, Bourla acknowledged that 2023 was a rough year for the company and its stock price. But he said Pfizer took steps to start 2024 with a ""clean slate."" Those included renegotiating multibillion-dollar Covid contracts with the EU and other governments, transitioning its Covid products to the commercial market in several countries and writing off unused stock of its vaccine and Paxlovid. ""So it's not simple, how many people will use the vaccine. There were a lot of things we had to remove"" he said. Bourla also touted Pfizer's portfolio of new products that it said will boost sales, including nine new product approvals in the U.S. last year and a pipeline of drugs that could bring in more future revenue. Pfizer has also repeatedly said that the Seagen deal brings a proven antibody-drug conjugate platform that enhances its commercial structure and could help the company become a ""world-class oncology leader."" Pfizer has said Seagen could contribute more than $10 billion in risk-adjusted sales by 2030 with its targeted cancer therapies. Those revenue streams would help Pfizer prepare for upcoming patent expirations for blockbuster drugs, including its breast cancer treatment Ibrance, and Eliquis, a blood thinner it shares with Bristol Myers Squibb .

A 'slap in the face'

Some current and former employees said they knew early in 2023 that wide-scale layoffs were possible. Those people alleged that Pfizer has long had a culture of hiring too many people and later laying many employees off — a cycle seen at many other large companies. Pfizer wasn't the only Covid-boom company whose business declined. Biotech company Moderna 's revenue from its Covid shot also plunged in 2023. Companies outside the pharmaceutical industry that flourished in 2020, including fitness firm Peloton and digital meeting platform Zoom , also struggled to adjust as people returned to their pre-pandemic lives. Other drugmakers big and small are still downsizing and restructuring their workforces. Big pharmaceutical companies, such as Bristol Myers Squibb, are trying to conserve cash as they could lose revenue from upcoming drug patent expirations and Medicare drug price negotiations, among other threats. Biotech companies are also working to stay afloat after a rough 2023 marked by rising interest rates, a poor deal market and a lack of fundraising. At Pfizer, there were other warnings of trouble ahead, according to current and former employees: a small round of layoffs during the first quarter of 2023 and budget restrictions that limited travel, team lunch outings and purchases of new lab and manufacturing equipment. Pfizer's announcement in March 2023 that it would acquire Seagen for a whopping $43 billion was another sign, according to some current and former employees. While most of the 11 workers acknowledged that the deal made sense for Pfizer's growth, they said the hefty price tag at a time when Covid sales had already started to decline left them uneasy. Still, a few former employees said they felt blindsided by the company's decision to let go of staff, saying they were relatively optimistic about the business before the October cost-cut announcement. One former employee who worked at a site focused on gene therapies in Durham, North Carolina, said they were repeatedly told their job would be safe — even as Pfizer divested much of its early stage portfolio for those treatments at the start of 2023. The company confirmed with news outlets in October that it would close that site and lay off an undisclosed number of staff. Notably, Pfizer's layoffs also affected some workers involved in the research, development and manufacturing of the company's Covid vaccine, according to some current and former employees. They said those workers, whom Pfizer celebrated as pandemic heroes just a year earlier, felt especially betrayed by the cuts. ""It felt like we were tossed out the door when they no longer needed us,"" said one former employee who worked on the vaccine.

All the current and former employees who spoke with CNBC said they believed the company handled the layoffs and the months leading up to them poorly. Some workers said they were disappointed with what they called higher management's lack of transparency around the layoffs. Some also questioned why Pfizer did not set more realistic expectations for its Covid business earlier, especially as cases and public concern about the virus diminished in the U.S. On Oct. 17, just a few days after Pfizer publicly announced its cost-cutting program to investors, executives held a companywide town hall with Pfizer's more than 80,000-person workforce that one worker described as ""disastrous"" and another called a ""slap in the face."" On the town hall, Bourla and Pfizer Chief Human Experience Officer Payal Sahni Becher acknowledged the company's Covid business was struggling but said it was positioning for growth with the cost cuts, according to some current and former employees. Those people said the executives addressed the looming layoffs during the town hall but provided scant details on how many workers, teams or sites they would affect, when they would occur or how the company decided who would lose their jobs. Many workers also alleged that Bourla and Becher were too casual during the town hall, cracking light jokes and chuckling at some of the questions asked by staff, such as one about employee bonuses.

Return-to-office policies

On top of layoffs, return-to-office policies launched in 2023 forced out some workers in fully remote roles, some current and former employees said. Those people said some fully remote employees had their virtual work status revoked and were asked to start working in person at their site starting on a certain date under the new mandates. While some workers were asked to come in only two or three days a week, even that was impossible for staff members who lived too far from their sites, according to the employees. Some remote workers who did not comply over time were let go, the current and former employees said. A Pfizer spokesperson did not confirm or provide any details about its recent return-to-office policies. ""The return to office has been possibly the worst managed factor in all of this,"" one current employee said.

Those policies also applied to workers who were relocated from recently closed facilities, according to some employees. For example, Pfizer in October said it would shut down its office in Peapack, New Jersey in 2024, which affected nearly 800 workers. The company first announced those plans in 2021. Pfizer told news outlets that the majority of employees would be relocated to its headquarters in New York City. For one employee, a 15-minute commute to work became closer to an hour-and-a-half trip. During another town hall, on Oct. 26, Pfizer Chief Global Supply Officer Mike McDermott said the decision to close the Peapack site ""wasn't made lightly."" But he said having Peapack employees work in person at the company's headquarters was ""right for Pfizer's culture,"" according to a recording heard by CNBC. He said the company isn't taking away remote work as an option. Pfizer leadership has been vocal about asking employees to work in person again. ""Teleconferencing is simply no substitute for the personal interaction that makes it possible to share ideas, build connection, or even agree to disagree,"" Bourla said during the APEC CEO Summit in November. Pfizer is just one of several companies across different industries to push for in-person work again after the pandemic. Tech giants such as Google similarly reversed course on remote work in 2023 after offering flexibility to employees throughout Covid, reportedly frustrating workers.

Employee morale

Employee morale plummeted in the months after the October layoff announcement, according to current and former employees. Some of those people said they were unmotivated to work with their job security in question, while one worker described ""walking on eggshells"" for weeks out of fear that they would lose their job. Other employees said they were stretched thin due to understaffing and a lack of other resources. A few workers said they struggled to keep up with abrupt internal changes, such as being assigned to new managers or being moved onto different teams. Some current employees said Pfizer has held several so-called transparency meetings, which allow workers to anonymously ask questions and provide feedback to senior leadership. Faith in executive leadership also plunged among some workers, according to most of the current and former employees who spoke with CNBC. Some employees acknowledged that executives have a duty to care about their company's stock price but said that Bourla and other officials appeared to be hyper-focused on Pfizer shares even as people lost their jobs. Some current workers said that hasn't appeared to change after the town hall on May 2. Others said Bourla's remarks were encouraging and sounded far more genuine.

Nike CEO John Donahoe appears to be on thin ice. The former top executive of eBay , who has been at the helm of Nike since January 2020, is starting to lose Wall Street's confidence after the company capped off a lackluster fiscal year with more bad news. On Thursday, Nike warned that sales in its current quarter were expected to decline by a staggering 10% – far worse than the 3.2% drop LSEG had projected – after it posted its slowest annual sales gain in 14 years, excluding the Covid-19 pandemic. The company also said it expects fiscal 2025 sales to be down mid-single digits when it previously expected them to grow. The warning signs led shares to close 20% lower on Friday -- making it the worst trading day in the company's history since its IPO in Dec. 1980. The plunge wiped about $28 billion off of Nike's market cap, bringing it to just under $114 billion from $142 billion a day earlier. As Wall Street digested the dismal outlook from the world's largest sportswear company, at least six investment banks downgraded Nike's stock. Analysts at Morgan Stanley and Stifel took it a step further, specifically calling the company's management into question. ""The FY25 guide (the 5th downward consensus revision in 6 quarters), pushes prospects for growth inflection further into 2025 (perhaps FY4Q or spring '25 at the earliest) asking investors to both underwrite success of not yet proven styles and look across an uncertain consumer discretionary backdrop into 2HCY24 until momentum could build again into 2HCY25,"" wrote Stifel analyst Jim Duffy. ""Management credibility is severely challenged and potential for C-level regime change adds further uncertainty.""

Stock Chart Icon Stock chart icon Nike stock has underperformed the S&P 500 during CEO John Donahoe's tenure.

Since Donahoe took over as Nike's top executive, its stock is down more than 25% as of Friday's close, significantly underperforming both the S&P 500 and the XRT – the retail-focused ETF – which saw gains of around 67% and 66% in that time period, respectively. Nike finance chief Matt Friend on Thursday attributed the guidance cut to a host of factors. Some, like softness in China and challenging foreign exchange headwinds, are outside of Nike's control, but others are problems it squarely created under Donahoe's leadership. The company is expecting wholesale orders to be slow as it scales new styles, pulls back on classic franchises and works to repair its relationships with key retail partners after spending the last few years cutting them off in favor of a direct-selling strategy. At the same time, loyal customers who shop on Nike's website are no longer springing for new pairs of Air Force 1s, Air Jordan 1s or Dunks, the company's core franchises. Critics say the sneaker lines have dominated the retailer's offerings for too long and turned customers away as they sought fresh styles and innovative designs from a slew of upstart competitors. That's left Nike to win back some of its most essential customers – runners. As the retailer focused on its direct-selling strategy at the expense of innovation, scrappy competitors like On Running and Hoka snatched up market share.","In this article NKE Follow your favorite stocks CREATE FREE ACCOUNTJohn Donahoe, attends the first day of the annual Allen & Company Sun Valley Conference, in Sun Valley, Idaho.

NASA and Boeing are further extending the first Starliner crewed flight but are not yet setting a new target date for returning the capsule to Earth, the organizations announced Friday.

Boeing's Starliner capsule ""Calypso"" will stay at the International Space Station into next month while the company and NASA conduct new testing back on the ground. Boeing's crew flight test represents the first time Starliner is carrying people, flying NASA astronauts Butch Wilmore and Suni Williams.

Officials say the Starliner team is starting a test campaign of the spacecraft's thruster technology at White Sands, New Mexico — testing that will be completed before Starliner returns to Earth.

""We think the testing could take a couple of weeks. We're trying to replicate the inflight conditions as best we can on the ground,"" NASA's Commercial Crew manager Steve Stich said during a press conference.

Before launching on June 5, Boeing and NASA planned for Starliner to be in space for nine days. As of Friday, the Starliner flight has tallied 24 days and counting.

Despite the extended stay at the ISS, officials emphasized that Starliner is safe to return at any point in case of an emergency. NASA and Boeing say the delay for testing is solely to gather more data about the spacecraft's performance, in particular its thruster system.

""I want to make it very clear that Butch and Suni are not stranded in space,"" Stich said.

The Starliner crew flight test represents a final major step before NASA certifies Boeing to fly crew on operational, six-month missions. Yet, similar to the previous two spaceflights that were uncrewed, Starliner is running into several problems during the mission.","Boeing's crew flight test represents the first time Starliner is carrying people, flying NASA astronauts Butch Wilmore and Suni Williams.

Ford Motor expects to introduce a $30,000 all-electric vehicle that will be profitable in roughly two and a half years, CEO Jim Farley said Friday during the Aspen Ideas Festival.

Farley did not release many other details about the vehicle, which is being developed by a Ford ""skunkworks"" team, but said its main competitors are expected to be Chinese automakers such as BYD and an anticipated entry-level car from U.S. EV leader Tesla .

Farley said Ford is first focusing on smaller EVs instead of larger all-electric trucks and SUVs, which have historically been gas-powered profit engines for the company, because such vehicles are ""never going to make money.""

""You have to make a radical change as an [automaker] to get to a profitable EV. The first thing we have to do is really put all of our capital toward smaller, more affordable EVs,"" Farley said during an interview with CNBC's Julia Boorstin. ""That's the duty cycle that we've now found that really matches. These big, huge, enormous EVs, they're never going to make money. The battery is $50,000. … The batteries will never be affordable.""

A Ford spokesman later clarified Farley was referring to large vehicles such as the company's Super Duty models or vehicles that require massive battery packs to achieve significant EV ranges of 500 miles. He was not referring to ones such as Ford's current all-electric F-150 Lightning pickup or next-generation EVs.

Ford earlier this year said it was postponing production of a large three-row SUV at a plant in Canada to 2027 from its initial plan of 2025. It also postponed a next-generation pickup, codenamed ""T3,"" from late 2025 to 2026.

Farley on Friday reiterated Ford's next-generation vehicles would be profitable.

He also said Americans need to ""get back in love"" with small cars instead of larger ones, a surprising statement given a majority or Ford's profits come from trucks and considering American carmakers have historically had trouble making money on small models.

""We have to start to get back in love with smaller vehicles. It's super important for our society and for EV adoption,"" Farley said Friday. ""We are just in love with these monster vehicles, and I love them too, but it's a major issue with weight.""

Ford's EV unit lost $1.32 billion during the first quarter of this year on 10,000 vehicles wholesaled. While the unit also includes EV-related business such as software, those losses equate to a loss of $132,000 per vehicle the unit sells.

Farley said it is crucial for Ford to make profitable EVs in the next five years as Chinese automakers continue to expand globally.

""If we cannot make money on EVs, we have competitors who have the largest market in the world, who already dominate globally, already setting up their supply chain around the world,"" he said. ""And if we don't make profitable EVs in the next five years, what is the future? We will just shrink into North America.""","Ford Motor expects to introduce a $30,000 all-electric vehicle that will be profitable in roughly two and a half years, CEO Jim Farley said Friday during the Aspen Ideas Festival.

Tractor Supply, a retail chain that sells home improvement equipment, livestock and agricultural supplies for farmers and pet owners, is eliminating diversity, equity and inclusion roles; withdrawing carbon emission goals; and walking back support for the LGBTQ community as part of sweeping changes to environmental, social and governance initiatives, the company announced this week.

The retailer said in a Thursday release that it will no longer submit data to the Human Rights Campaign, an LGBTQ advocacy group. The company will also stop sponsoring Pride festivals and voting campaigns, the release said. The company previously earned a perfect score on the Human Rights Campaign Foundation's 2022 Best Places to Work Corporate Equality Index.

The announcement comes in the final days of Pride Month.

Tractor Supply is also retiring initiatives aimed at reducing environmental impact and improving employee diversity. The company had set goals to achieve net zero carbon emissions in operations by 2040 and to reduce its water usage by 2025. Its DEI targets included boosting the number of employees of color at the manager level and above by 50% by 2026.

Tractor Supply said it's making the changes to better represent the values of the communities and customers it serves. The retailer caters to largely rural communities, with 50,000 employees across 2,250 stores in 49 states, according to company data.

""Rural communities are the backbone of our nation and what make America great,"" Tractor Supply said in the news release. ""We have heard from customers that we have disappointed them. We have taken this feedback to heart.""

Tractor Supply said it has invested millions of dollars in veteran causes, state fairs, animal shelters, rodeos and farmers markets and that it invests in the future of rural America by being the largest supporter of FFA, a nonprofit that promotes agricultural education for middle and high schoolers.

The retailer was previously included on Newsweek's list of America's Greatest Workplaces for Diversity in 2023 and was named to Bloomberg's Gender Equality Index for 2022 and 2023.

The publicly traded company has a market valuation of about $29 billion. CNBC contacted Tractor Supply for more details about the changes, and the company declined to comment beyond the release.

The changes come amid a growing wave of anti-DEI sentiment in the wake of a U.S. Supreme Court decision in 2023 to strike down affirmative action in colleges. Experts at the time predicted the ruling could have implications for corporate hiring or recruiting.

Companies, including Starbucks , Disney and Target , have faced legal challenges over DEI initiatives for LGBTQ customers and employees. In February 2023, pharmaceutical giant Pfizer dropped race-based eligibility requirements for a fellowship program designed for college students of Black, Latino and Native American descent, the Associated Press reported.","Shoppers are seen at the parking lot of a Tractor Supply Co. store near Bloomsburg.

Shares of Nike plunged on Friday after the retailer cut its full-year guidance and said it expects sales to drop 10% during its current quarter as it warned of soft sales in China and ""uneven"" consumer trends across the globe.

The expected 10% first-quarter slump is far below the 3.2% drop that analysts had expected, according to LSEG.

Nike shares plunged nearly 20% in trading Friday.

The sneaker giant, which reported quarterly earnings Thursday, now expects fiscal 2025 sales to be down mid-single digits, compared to analyst estimates of a 0.9% increase. Nike previously expected sales to grow. The company also expects sales in the first half to be down in the high single digits, compared to previous guidance of declines in the low single digits.

""A comeback at this scale takes time,"" the retailer's finance chief Matthew Friend said on a call with analysts Thursday. ""Although the next few quarters will be challenging, we are confident that we are repositioning Nike to be more competitive with a more balanced portfolio to drive sustainable, profitable, long-term growth.""

The company cut its guidance as it contends with slower online sales, planned declines in classic footwear franchises, ""increased macro uncertainty"" in the Greater China region and ""uneven consumer trends"" across Nike's markets, Friend said. It also expects sales into wholesalers to be slower as it scales new innovations and pulls back on classic franchises.

For the fiscal fourth quarter, the company handily beat earnings estimates as its cost-cutting efforts continue to bear fruit, but Nike fell short on revenue.

Here's how Nike did during the period compared with what Wall Street was anticipating, based on a survey of analysts by LSEG:

Earnings per share: $1.01 adjusted vs. 83 cents expected

$1.01 adjusted vs. 83 cents expected Revenue: $12.61 billion vs. $12.84 billion expected

The company's reported net income for the three-month period that ended May 31 was $1.5 billion, or 99 cents per share, compared with $1.03 billion, or 66 cents per share, a year earlier.

Sales dropped to $12.61 billion, down about 2% from $12.83 billion a year earlier.

In fiscal 2024, Nike posted sales of $51.36 billion, which is flat compared to the prior year. It's the slowest pace of annual sales growth the company has seen since 2010, excluding the Covid-19 pandemic.

Nike executives attributed the sales miss to a range of factors. They said its lifestyle business declined during the quarter and that momentum in its performance business, such as its basketball and running shoes, wasn't enough to offset it.

Online performance was soft because Nike had a higher share of lifestyle products, more promotions and fewer sales of classic franchises, such as its Air Force 1. It also saw traffic in China decline across all channels beginning in April due to macro conditions in the region.

Despite the traffic decline in China, sales in the region exceeded Wall Street expectations, according to StreetAccount, coming in at $1.86 billion, compared with estimates of $1.79 billion. It was the only geographical segment to top estimates for the period.

Sales in North America, its largest market, came in at $5.28 billion, below StreetAccount expectations of $5.45 billion.

In Europe, Middle East and Africa, Nike posted revenue of $3.29 billion, compared to estimates of $3.32 billion. In Asia Pacific and Latin America, Nike saw $1.71 billion in sales, compared to estimates of $1.77 billion.

Still, Friend later warned of the ""softer outlook"" in China and said had it not been for Chinese marketplace Tmall's early start to the region's 618 shopping holiday, sales in the country would've fallen short of Nike's internal expectations.

""The China marketplace remains highly promotional, and we continue to manage both Nike and partners' inventory carefully,"" said Friend. ""While our outlook for the near term has softened, we remain confident in Nike's competitive position in China in the long term.""

Nike's Converse brand was once again a significant underperformer in the overall results. The division saw revenue plunge 18% to $480 million, largely due to declines in North America and Western Europe.","Nike previously expected sales to grow.

She bought an inflatable pool from Sam's Club.

The pool began leaking air after just a few uses.

For Crozier, chief merchant of the Walmart -owned membership club, that trashed pool — and the disappointment that came with it — helped kickstart a years-long effort to catch up with chief rival Costco and the popularity of its private brand, Kirkland Signature.

As Sam's Club opens more locations, it is trying to raise the bar for its own brand, Member's Mark. The label's makeover has become critical for Sam's Club as it aims to close the gap with Costco, which has roughly the same number of U.S. clubs but about twice as much annual revenue. Net sales for Sam's Club totaled $86.2 billion in its most recent fiscal year, compared with $176.63 billion for Costco's U.S. clubs.

Sam's Club CEO Chris Nicholas told CNBC the brand's revamp was inspired, in part, by the retailer's chief rival.

""The club model survives because you have brilliant merchants focusing on creating or buying exceptional items,"" he said in an interview. ""Costco did such a great job of that over the years with Kirkland and we saw that be successful.""

The success of Member's Mark will help determine how Sam's Club fares as its expands, with plans to open more than 30 stores over the next four years. At least some stores will be in regions where potential customers belong to a competing club like Costco or B.J.'s Wholesale , or in areas where customers may need convincing to pay an annual membership to be able to shop.

Overtaking Costco and its beloved private label won't be easy for Sam's Club, said Michael Baker, a retail analyst for D.A. Davidson.

""Never say never,"" he said. ""Who knows? But I think it's going to take a long time.""

But he added Costco's success with Kirkland Signature created a formula that Sam's Club can follow.

The popularity of Kirkland's brand, which includes a diverse range of items like vodka, batteries and dress shirts, has helped to drive membership sign-ups and renewals. It is one of the features that Costco highlights when the retailer's pitch to members.","As Sam's Club opens more locations, it is trying to raise the bar for its own brand, Member's Mark.

Though the price increases have slowed this year in comparison to the past decade, the higher costs are raising out-of-pocket expenses for consumers. The average American spends $16.26 out of pocket per prescription, according to the data.

""When things increase … inevitably, they do trickle down to consumers, especially those who are in a high deductible plan or who don't have insurance or find themselves paying substantially out of pocket,"" said GoodRx director of research Tori Marsh.

GoodRx said the patients' share of the cost continues to grow due to rising copays, coinsurances and deductibles. The company found that over the past 10 years, the average person's deductible nearly doubled, and copays are rising as the majority of plans are adding another tier of drugs with higher copays.

It is a dynamic GoodRx deems ""the big pinch."" High medication costs are coupled with reduced insurance coverage. Analyzing coverage for more than 3,700 Medicare Part D plans between 2010 and 2024, GoodRx found that the portion of medications covered dropped 19% during that period.

""The impact is really kind of threefold,"" Marsh said. ""Rising costs or rising prices are a big part of it, but it's really that with the combination of increased friction. … It's hard for people to, in some ways, access their medication or access a pharmacy. And then on top of that, insurance is not what it used to be. It's not covering as much as it used to.""

On average, Americans pay two to three times more for prescription drugs than consumers in other developed countries, according to the White House.

Drug costs have become a focus for President Joe Biden, particularly as he approaches the 2024 election. The Biden administration has taken several measures to lower out-of-pocket drug expenses.

On Wednesday, the White House announced it would lower prices on 64 prescription drugs for some Medicare beneficiaries as a result of inflation penalties on drugmakers.

The lower costs, effective during the third quarter, will benefit roughly 750,000 people who use the drugs annually, some of whom could save up to $4,593 per day, according to the release.

""Despite efforts by policymakers and industry leaders to break down affordability and accessibility barriers, a patient's actual out-of-pocket cost continues to increase and is often a huge surprise to them,"" said GoodRx interim CEO Scott Wagner in a news release.

Tesla is losing its lead over legacy automakers in the quality of its new all-electric vehicles, according to an annual influential study conducted by J.D. Power.

The 2024 U.S. Initial Quality Study found the quality of Tesla's battery-electric vehicles, or BEVs, and those of traditional carmakers were the same, at 266 problems reported per 100 newly sold or leased vehicles.

Previously, Tesla models had outperformed the electric vehicles of legacy automakers in the annual survey. Last year, the Tesla received a rank of 257 problems per 100 vehicles, compared with 265 problems per 100 vehicles on average for EVs from traditional automakers.

The study attributes Tesla's growing problems to a negative response from customers after the company removed traditional feature controls, such as turn signals and wiper stalks.

Across the broader industry, not just BEVs, Tesla has consistently ranked toward the bottom in initial quality since J.D. Power began including Tesla in the study in 2022.

Overall, the study, which included repair visits data of franchised dealers for the first time, found electric vehicles such as BEVs and plug-in hybrid electric vehicles (PHEVs), are plagued with more problems than traditional gas- and diesel-powered vehicles with internal combustion engines.

""Owners of cutting edge, tech-filled BEVs and PHEVs are experiencing problems that are of a severity level high enough for them to take their new vehicle into the dealership at a rate three times higher than that of gas-powered vehicle owners,"" J.D. Power's senior director of auto benchmarking, Frank Hanley, said in a news release.

The study found that plug-in vehicles require more repairs than gas-powered vehicles across all repair categories.

BEVs averaged 266 problems per 100 vehicles, 86 points higher than gas- and diesel-powered vehicles, which averaged 180 problems per 100 vehicles, according to the study. A lower score indicates higher vehicle quality.

Top concerns included features, controls and displays as well as wireless smartphone integration, as customers reported frequent difficulties with Apple CarPlay and Android Auto.

The study also reported frustration over false warnings, unnecessary traffic alerts and automatic braking features. Specifically, rear seat reminders contribute 1.7 problems per 100 vehicles across the industry, as owners report receiving signals even when no one is in the rear seat.

""It is not surprising that the introduction of new technology has challenged manufacturers to maintain vehicle quality,"" Hanley said.

A Thursday investor event for Rivian Automotive that focused on cost-cutting efforts, efficiency gains and in-house technologies and software wasn't enough to build on the company's significant share growth this week. Shares of the all-electric vehicle startup fell by about 2% to 6% for much of the event, eating into some of its 23% gain in shares the day before on news of an up to $5 billion investment by Volkswagen Group . Rivian's stock closed Thursday down 1.8% to $14.47 per share, off by roughly 39% year to date amid investor concerns regarding cash burn and a slowdown in EV sales. Rivian on Thursday reconfirmed its 2024 guidance that included production of 57,000 vehicles and a path to positive gross profit during the fourth quarter, including regulatory credits. It also outlined longer-term growths, such as plans to achieve positive adjusted earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization in 2027. ""Everything that you're hearing from us, around our product, around how we're running the business, around how we're driving toward profitability, my hope is that you're seeing really an extreme sense of urgency,"" Rivian CEO RJ Scaringe said during the event. ""We're very, very fast driving towards the improvements necessary to get to positive free cash flow and, before that, positive margins this year.""

Rivian also outlined long-term financial targets of a roughly 25% gross margin, 10% free cash flow and adjusted profit margin in the ""high teens."" The company did not release a time frame for these targets. Scaringe spent much of his time during the roughly four-hour presentation discussing efficiencies in products and manufacturing, which he said are expected to lead to 20% material cost reductions in its current vehicles, followed by 45% targeted reductions in its upcoming ""R2"" vehicles, which are projected to begin production in early 2026. The reductions range from physical savings, such as a 54% decrease in design costs of its R2 vehicles compared with current models, to lower costs on more complex systems such as battery packs and electrical hardware. For example, the company is using 10 fewer in-house electronic control units, or ECUs, in its recently redesigned R1 vehicles, allowing it to remove 1.6 miles in wiring harness length and 44 pounds out of the vehicle. Rivian's software expertise is at the center of VW's plans to invest $5 billion in the automaker by 2026, including an anticipated joint venture between the companies to create electrical architecture and software technology. Volkswagen is expected to use Rivian's electrical architecture and software stack for vehicles beginning in the second half of the decade, Scaringe said during the investment announcement. He said the joint venture does not include anything with battery technologies, vehicle propulsion platforms, high voltage systems or autonomy and electrical hardware.

The retail pharmacy giant now expects fiscal 2024 adjusted earnings of $2.80 to $2.95 per share. That compares with the company's previous outlook of between $3.20 and $3.35 per share.

""'We assumed ... in the second half that the consumer would get somewhat stronger"" but ""that is not the case,"" Walgreens CEO Tim Wentworth told CNBC.

He added that ""the consumer is absolutely stunned by the absolute prices of things, and the fact that some of them may not be inflating doesn't actually change their resistance to the current pricing. So we've had to get really keen, particularly in discretionary things.""

Still, Walgreens topped revenue estimates for the quarter on strong performance in its health-care segment. The company views that business division as critical to its ongoing push to transform from a major drugstore chain into a large health-care company.

The results come as Walgreens works to slash costs after a rocky last year marked by low pharmacy reimbursement rates, weakening demand for Covid products and a challenging macroeconomic environment.

The company on Friday said it is simplifying its U.S. health-care portfolio and finalizing plans to close underperforming U.S. stores over multiple years, among other ongoing cost-cutting efforts.

""Seventy-five percent of our stores drive 100% of our profitability today,"" Wentworth said. ""What that means is the others we take a hard look at, we are going to finalize a number that we will close.""

Here's what Walgreens reported for the three-month period ended May 31 compared with what Wall Street was expecting, based on a survey of analysts by LSEG:

Earnings per share: 63 cents adjusted vs. 68 cents expected

63 cents adjusted vs. 68 cents expected Revenue: $36.4 billion vs. $35.94 billion expected

Walgreens booked sales of $36.4 billion for the quarter, up 2.6% from the same period a year ago.

The company reported net income of $344 million, or 40 cents per share, for the quarter. That compares with net income of $118 million, or 14 cents per share, for the same period a year ago.

Excluding certain items, adjusted earnings were 63 cents per share for the quarter.

Walgreens did not provide a new revenue forecast for the fiscal year. The company has not offered that guidance since October, when it said it expected $141 billion to $145 billion in sales.","Shares of Walgreens closed more than 20% lower on Thursday after the company reported fiscal third-quarter earnings that fell short of expectations and slashed its full-year adjusted profit outlook, citing a ""challenging"" environment for pharmacies and U.S. consumers.

Chinese automakers are expected to continue rapidly expanding outside of their home country to achieve 33% of the global automotive market share by 2030, according to a new report released Thursday by prominent consulting firm AlixPartners. Much of the growth, from a forecast 21% market share this year, is expected to come outside of China. Sales outside of China are expected to grow from 3 million this year to 9 million by 2030, representing growth from 3% to 13% of market share by the end of this decade. The rapid expansion of Chinese automakers is a growing concern for legacy automakers and politicians globally. Many fear that the less-expensive, China-made vehicles will flood the markets, undercutting domestic-produced models, especially all-electric vehicles.

AlixPartners said it expects the Chinese brands to grow across all markets globally. However, the firm added that it expects far smaller expansion in Japan and North America, including the U.S., where vehicle safety standards are more stringent and a 100% tariff on imported Chinese EVs has been announced. ""China is the industry's new disruptor – capable of creating must-have vehicles that are faster to market, cheaper to buy, advanced on tech and design, and more efficient to build,"" Mark Wakefield, global co-leader of the automotive and industrial practice at AlixPartners, said in a statement. In North America, Chinese automakers are forecast to only achieve a 3% market share, largely in Mexico, where one in five vehicles are expected to be Chinese brands by 2030. In most other major regions of the world, AlixPartners reports that the share of Chinese automakers is expected to exponentially grow. Those areas include Central and South America, Southeast Asia and the Middle East and Africa. Chinese brands in China also are expected to grow from 59% to 72% in market share, according to AlixPartners. Legacy automakers such as General Motors have lost significant ground in China in recent years amid the rapid rise of China's domestic automotive industry and companies such as BYD , Geely and Nio .

JPMorgan Chase said late Wednesday that the Federal Reserve overestimated a key measure of income in the giant bank's recent stress test, and that its losses under the exam should actually be higher than what the regulator found.

The bank took the unusual step of issuing a press release minutes before midnight ET to disclose its response to the Fed's findings.

JPMorgan said that the Fed's projections for a measure called ""other comprehensive income"" — which represents revenues, expenses and losses that are excluded from net income — ""appears to be too large.""

Under the Fed's table of projected revenue, income and losses though 2026, JPMorgan was assigned $13 billion in OCI, more than any of the 31 lenders in this year's test. It also estimated that the bank would face roughly $107 billion in loan, investment and trading losses in that scenario.

""Should the Firm's analysis be correct, the resulting stress losses would be modestly higher than those disclosed by the Federal Reserve,"" the bank said.

The error means that JPMorgan might require more time to finalize its share repurchase plan, according to a person with knowledge of the situation who declined to be identified speaking about the regulatory process. Banks were expected to begin disclosing those plans on Friday after the market closes.

The news is a wrinkle to the Federal Reserve's announcement Wednesday that all 31 of the banks in the annual exercise cleared the hurdle of being able to withstand a severe hypothetical recession, while maintaining adequate capital levels and the ability to lend to consumers and corporations.

Last year, Bank of America and Citigroup made similar disclosures, saying that estimates of their own future income differed from the Fed's results.

Maxar Technologies | Via Reuters

NASA will have a spacecraft from Elon Musk's SpaceX guide the International Space Station's destruction later this decade, the agency announced Wednesday. The National Aeronautics and Space Administration awarded an $843 million contract to SpaceX to build the so-called ""U.S. Deorbit Vehicle."" The spacecraft will be designed to guide the football-field-sized research laboratory back into the Earth's atmosphere after retiring in 2030. The SpaceX-built vehicle will effectively destroy the ISS by pushing the station into reentry from orbit. ""It is crucial to prepare for the safe and responsible deorbit of the International Space Station in a controlled manner,"" NASA said in a press release, with the U.S. Deorbit Vehicle needed to ""ensure avoidance of risk to populated areas.""

NASA did not specify whether SpaceX's design for the U.S. Deorbit Vehicle will be based on one of the company's existing spacecraft, such as its Dragon capsules. SpaceX and NASA did not immediately respond to CNBC's request for comment on the design. Sign up here to receive weekly editions of CNBC's Investing in Space newsletter. The U.S. – along with four international partner agencies representing Russia, Europe, Canada, and Japan – has been preparing for the eventual end of the ISS, which has been crewed since 2000. The ISS, primarily created as a crewed research laboratory, has seen more than 3,300 experiments conducted in microgravity. That includes research not possible on Earth such as medical sciences and technology demonstrations.

Aging ISS

But the ISS is aging, with NASA and its lead partner Roscosmos, unable to solve a worsening problem of microscopic leaks on the station. NASA published a study on Wednesday with analysis of why it decided to intentionally destroy the ISS in a controlled reentry. The agency evaluated a variety of alternatives, including disassembling the station in orbit or trying to raise the ISS to a higher orbit with a large spacecraft like SpaceX's Starship. ""The space station is a unique artifact whose historical value cannot be overstated. NASA considered this when determining if any part of the station could be salvaged for historical preservation or technical analysis,"" the agency wrote. Ultimately, the agency study determined that any attempts to preserve or reuse the ISS were technically or economically infeasible. NASA noted the possibility the ISS' operational lifetime could be extended beyond 2030, but that is yet to be determined and requires agreement with its international partner agencies. NASA is planning to replace the ISS through private space stations and is helping fund U.S. companies' development through the Commercial LEO Destinations (CLD) program. The ISS totaled about $150 billion to develop and build and costs NASA about $4 billion each year to operate, so the agency sees privately built space stations as a way to replace the ISS at a fraction of the cost.","A satellite image shows an overview of the International Space Station with the Boeing Starliner spacecraft, June 7, 2024.

The jeans creator on Wednesday posted fiscal second-quarter revenue that fell just short of Wall Street's expectations at a time when shoppers are stocking their wardrobes with denim dresses, skirts and ultra low-rise baggy pants.

Levi's posted better-than-expected earnings as its direct sales to consumers and cost cutting continue to bear fruit. The company raised its dividend by 8% to 13 cents per share, its first increase in six quarters.

Still, shares fell about 15% in extended trading.

Here's how Levi's performed during the quarter compared with what Wall Street was anticipating, based on a survey of analysts by LSEG:

Earnings per share: 16 cents adjusted vs. 11 cents expected

16 cents adjusted vs. 11 cents expected Revenue: $1.44 billion vs. $1.45 billion expected

The company's reported net income for the three-month period that ended May 26 was $18 million, or 4 cents per share, compared with a loss of $1.6 million, or zero cents a share, a year earlier. Excluding one-time items, Levi's posted earnings of $66 million, or 16 cents per share.

Sales rose to $1.44 billion, up about 8% from $1.34 billion a year earlier. However, the sales jump was coming off of an easier comparison.

In the year-ago period, sales were down 9% after Levi's shifted its wholesale shipments from its fiscal second quarter into its fiscal first quarter. The shift reduced sales last year by about $100 million, the company said previously. Excluding the shift, as well as the exit of Levi's Denizen business, sales would have been up by only about 1% in its most recent quarter compared to the year-ago period.

Finance chief Harmit Singh attributed the sales miss to unfavorable foreign exchange conditions and weak sales at Docker's. During the quarter, the khaki and chinos brand saw $82.4 million in sales, up 8.6% from $75.8 million in the year ago period. It's not clear how sales at Docker's were affected by the timing of Levi's wholesale orders.

""People are generally cautious,"" Singh told CNBC in an interview. ""It's not necessarily an environment where people are buying a lot, people are cautious.""

While Levi's posted a strong earnings beat, it only reaffirmed its full-year guidance, which was in line with estimates. The company continues to expect full-year earnings per share to be between $1.17 and $1.27, which now includes a 5-cent hit coming from the company's new distribution and logistics strategy.

Levi's said it is transitioning from a primarily owned-and-operated distribution and logistics network in the U.S. and Europe to one that relies more on third parties.

""In the near term, these changes require the parallel operation of new and old facilities for the rest of 2024, resulting in a transitory increase in distribution costs,"" the company said.

The change allows Levi's to shift the responsibility of final mile delivery to third parties. The denim maker noted that it has new terms with its supplier that result in Levi's taking ownership of inventory closer to the point of shipment rather than its eventual destination. Levi's distribution network was built for a business that primarily sold to wholesalers, and now it needs to change into one that's more focused on selling directly to consumers.

The changes are necessary because nearly half of Levi's sales these days are coming from its own website and stores.

Direct-to-consumer sales jumped 8% during the quarter, representing 47% of overall sales. Online sales increased 19%.

""Our transformational pivot to operating as a DTC-first company is yielding positive results around the world, giving me great confidence that we will achieve accelerated, profitable growth for the rest of the year and beyond,"" CEO Michelle Gass said in a statement.

During the quarter, wholesale revenue grew 7%, but excluding the shift in timing of wholesale orders, sales in the channel decreased 4%. Singh noted that wholesale revenue improved on a sequential basis, but the company has a ""conservative"" view of the channel's growth moving forward.

By building out its own direct channels, Levi's enjoys higher profits, better data on its consumers and less reliance on shaky wholesalers like Macy's and Kohl's, which are continuing to shrink and fall out of favor with consumers.

However, selling directly can also be more expensive, and can come with unexpected hiccups that can impact sales and drain profits. For example, when someone buys a pair of Levi's from Macy's and wants to return them, Macy's typically bears that cost. Under a direct model, that responsibility, including the cost and logistics, would fall on Levi's.

Nike has come to be known as a cautionary tale for retailers long reliant on wholesalers that try to expand direct sales.

For a while, Nike's focus on direct sales boosted revenue and profits, but some critics said the strategy shift led to a slowdown in innovation, and ultimately, market share losses.

Recently, the company acknowledged that it erred when it cut off so many of its wholesale partners and said it has since ""corrected"" that.

CNBC,https://www.cnbc.com/2024/06/26/fed-banks-stress-test-2024.html,2024-06-26,21:26:37 UTC,Federal Reserve says all 31 banks in annual stress test withstood a severe hypothetical downturn,"Federal Reserve Board Vice Chair for Supervision Michael Barr testifies before a House Financial Services Committee hearing on the response to the bank failures of Silicon Valley Bank and Signature Bank, on Capitol Hill in Washington, D.C., on March 29, 2023.

The Federal Reserve said Wednesday that the biggest banks operating in the U.S. would be able to withstand a severe recession scenario while maintaining their ability to lend to consumers and corporations.

Each of the 31 banks in this year's regulatory exercise cleared the hurdle of being able to absorb losses while maintaining more than the minimum required capital levels, the Fed said in a statement.

The stress test assumed that unemployment surges to 10%, commercial real estate values plunge 40% and housing prices fall 36%.

""This year's results show that under our stress scenario, large banks would take nearly $685 billion in total hypothetical losses, yet still have considerably more capital than their minimum common equity requirements,"" said Michael Barr, the Fed's vice chair for supervision. ""This is good news and underscores the usefulness of the extra capital that banks have built in recent years.""

The Fed's stress test is an annual ritual that forces banks to maintain adequate cushions for bad loans and dictates the size of share repurchases and dividends. This year's version included giants such as JPMorgan Chase and Goldman Sachs , credit card companies including American Express and regional lenders such as Truist .

While no bank appeared to get badly tripped up by this year's exercise, which had roughly the same assumptions as the 2023 test, the group's aggregate capital levels fell 2.8 percentage points, which was worse than last year's decline.

That is because the industry is holding more consumer credit card loans and more corporate bonds that have been downgraded. Lending margins have also been squeezed compared to last year, according to the Fed.

""While banks are well-positioned to withstand the specific hypothetical recession we tested them against, the stress test also confirmed that there are some areas to watch,"" Barr said. ""The financial system and its risks are always evolving, and we learned in the Great Recession the cost of failing to acknowledge shifting risks.""

The Fed also performed what it called an ""exploratory analysis"" of funding stresses and a trading meltdown that applied to only the eight biggest banks.

In this exercise, the companies appeared to avoid disaster, despite a sudden surge in the cost of deposits combined with a recession. In a scenario where five large hedge funds implode, the big banks would lose between $70 billion and $85 billion.

""The results demonstrated that these banks have material exposure to hedge funds but that they can withstand different types of trading book shocks,"" the Fed said.

Banks are expected to begin announcing their latest share repurchase plans on Friday.","The Federal Reserve said Wednesday that the biggest banks operating in the U.S. would be able to withstand a severe recession scenario while maintaining their ability to lend to consumers and corporations.

It's been almost 20 years since the founding of Alphabet's YouTube, and Hollywood still doesn't really know what to do with it. YouTube, which effectively invented user-generated content, claims a daunting share of overall media consumption. And it's no longer just dominating the internet, it's dominating the living room, too. YouTube made up 9.7% of all viewership on connected and traditional TVs in the U.S. in May — the largest share of TV for a streaming platform ever reported by Nielsen's monthly ""The Gauge"" report. Netflix ranked second, claiming 7.6% of viewership. Among streamers only, YouTube's total viewership was close to 25% market share. ""We're not talking about your mobile phone, your laptop, that I'm sure you see your kids using all the time, but on the biggest screen in the house, the TV,"" said LightShed media analyst Rich Greenfield. ""Every [media] executive has to be paying attention."" But media companies such as Netflix, Disney and Warner Bros. Discovery aren't sure whether YouTube is friend or foe. Some media executives see YouTube as a companion platform to subscription streaming services and cable TV — an unwieldy behemoth of non-narrative, creator-led content with a social media slant that doesn't really fit the New York-Hollywood nexus of professional media. Others — even at times the same executives — view YouTube as an existential threat to the entertainment industry, stealing viewership from subscription streaming services and, with it, the cultural center of American youth. Those competing truths have led media and entertainment companies to concoct a wide array of strategies to combat the growing threat. Disney leaders discuss YouTube ""every day"" in strategic meetings and have considered adding user-generated content to Disney+, though it's not on the immediate roadmap, according to people familiar with the matter, who asked not to be named because the discussions are private. Netflix and Warner Bros. Discovery, on the other hand, have consciously chosen to focus on the other 90% of the TV viewing world that isn't YouTube. ""I do think it snuck up on people that YouTube was as important a presence in people's lives and people's viewing experiences not just on the phone but in the living room,"" said Tara Walpert Levy, YouTube's vice president of Americas, in an interview. ""When Nielsen first noted that YouTube was winning the streaming wars in terms of viewing, full stop, not just for ad-supported platforms, I had a ton of my friends from advertising, from media, who were like, 'Can you believe it?' It exceeded even our expectations,"" she said.

YouTube's growing dominance

Earlier this year, YouTube Chief Executive Officer Neal Mohan announced that users watch more than 1 billion hours of YouTube content on TV screens each day. More than 150 million Americans watch YouTube on connected TVs each month, according to the company. Ad dollars have followed. In 2023, YouTube took in $31.5 billion in advertising revenue, up 8% from 2022 and 271% from six years ago. In the first quarter of 2024, YouTube's ad revenue climbed 21% from a year earlier to $8.1 billion. YouTube, founded in 2005, sold to Google for $1.65 billion a year later. It's since ballooned in size as advertisers flocked to the platform. MoffettNathanson media analyst Michael Nathanson estimated in March that YouTube would be worth a whopping $400 billion as a standalone company — more than Disney and Comcast combined. ""YouTube is still the 800-pound gorilla in this space, and I do believe they're a pretty unstoppable juggernaut,"" said Candle Media co-CEO Kevin Mayer, who previously ran Disney's streaming business and was briefly CEO of TikTok.

Disney's YouTube focus

Disney executives are particularly attuned to YouTube's rising dominance, given its grip on younger people, according to people familiar with the company's thinking. Disney has a legion of super-fans who flock to YouTube and other social media sites to promote and critique its parks, rides and merchandise, movies and TV shows. Integrating some of that content as shoulder programming to Disney's scripted series and movies could help keep users on Disney+. A Disney spokesperson declined to comment on conversations about adding original content to the platform. The company claims 11.4% of TV viewership, according to Nielsen's ""The Gauge"" report, when adding up cable and streaming, including Hulu and ESPN.

You're betraying your audience. You're leaving YouTube to act, and then you're not posting online anymore, and you're asking them to wait on a project that's in development for what? A year, two years? People are going to forget about you, girl. That's how the internet works."" Brittany Broski YouTube creator

""I think what we're seeing from all of these traditional media companies is they don't have enough content, and it's too expensive to produce the types of premium content at scale that they need. And so maybe the [user-generated content] economy is a place they look ... not to create their competitor, but as a lower cost way to add content to their services,"" said LightShed's Greenfield. Disney is also considering putting more full episodes of Disney+ and Hulu series geared to older kids and adults directly on YouTube to entice an audience that isn't currently subscribing to its streaming platforms, said a person familiar with the matter. This is a strategy Disney has done with kids content for years, helping amplify hit animated series such as ""Bluey,"" ""Spidey and his Amazing Friends"" and ""Mickey Mouse Clubhouse.""

""At the end of the day, Disney is a storytelling machine,"" said Mayer. ""We used short-form video on YouTube as a promotional device for our content. But I don't think that we at Disney, nor have any other traditional media companies, leaned into YouTube as an original storytelling device the way they probably should have."" According to internal research, Disney executives concluded that younger Americans use YouTube as an online encyclopedia, said one of the people familiar with the company's discussions. That's led the company to focus on the benefits of the platform's discovery functionality while also programming against it, the person said. Disney has made bespoke YouTube content for its new preschool series ""Disney Junior's Ariel,"" which debuts June 27, to introduce the mermaid character to kids. It has also developed a series of ""Winnie the Pooh"" shorts so that it can research how the animated bear and his friends resonate with today's youth. The company is now considering making a full-length animated series on ""Winnie the Pooh"" based on the short-form video data, the person said.

Netflix's muted response

Netflix is taking on YouTube from a different angle. It doesn't view the platform as the same singular threat to viewership that some of its peers do. Netflix famously considers everything that could occupy a user's time, even sleep, as a long-term competitor. For the time being, Netflix executives consider YouTube as catering to a different consumer need. ""We have built a hard-to-replicate combination of a strong slate, superior recommendations, broad reach and intense fandom, which drives healthy engagement on Netflix. Improvement in these key areas is the best way to delight our members and continue to grow our business,"" Netflix said in its most recent quarterly shareholder letter. Netflix has even found some success duplicating content on YouTube in specific instances. ""Cocomelon,"" the animated toddler-geared short-form video series owned by Candle Media's Moonbug Entertainment, has become massively popular on both YouTube and Netflix. ""Cocomelon"" has 175 million subscribers to its English language YouTube channel, and ""many more if you add in all languages,"" Mayer said. At the same time, ""Cocomelon"" frequently tops Netflix's most-watched list among kids shows.

The more immediate YouTube threat for Netflix comes from an advertising perspective. Netflix is now going head-to-head with YouTube for marketing dollars after introducing its ad-supported tier in November 2022. Netflix said in May that it has 40 million global monthly active users for its advertising tier. That's a far cry from YouTube's more than 2 billion monthly active users. Netflix is even contemplating launching free versions of its service in certain international markets to court advertisers, though there's nothing concrete planned, Bloomberg reported earlier this week. Netflix declined to comment for this story.

Other strategies

Comcast -owned NBCUniversal has experimented with new ways to copy the rabbit-hole effect of YouTube Shorts, which force-feed users content based on interest, by offering curated clips of ""Saturday Night Live"" sketches, scenes from ""The Office"" or favorite Bravo show moments. If younger users are being conditioned to watch in a certain way, NBCUniversal's Peacock streaming service wants to give consumers that choice in addition to its long-form movies and TV shows. But simply curating feeds within a content vertical now feels like a ""YouTube 1.0 strategy"" given how TikTok, YouTube Shorts and Instagram Reels have redefined short-form viewing, according to Nathanson. ""I don't think, at this point, there's a strategy in place among any of the traditional media players to create content for the YouTube generation that's more than just their branded strategy they're doing now,"" said Nathanson. ""The future strategy is to use AI to deliver personalization for each of us. Today, none of the traditional media players has that. That's YouTube 2.0."" Amazon is trying a more direct plan of attack — pay YouTube's biggest star to make a show for their own service. The company announced a deal earlier this year with MrBeast, whose real name is Jimmy Donaldson, to make a reality TV show, ""Beast Games,"" that will pay the winner $5 million in cash. The format will largely borrow from previous MrBeast giveaway videos that pit many contestants against each other for cash, using a ""fast-paced and high-production format,"" as Amazon has promised.

MrBeast's YouTube channel has the most subscribers worldwide at 289 million and expects to take in a whopping $700 million in revenue in 2024, primarily through advertising and brand deals. But while MrBeast may have crossover appeal, there's skepticism among creators that YouTube celebrities will have success making shows for subscription streaming services. Moreover, the entire Hollywood system may operate too slowly for a younger generation that demands immediate content.

YouTube's community

The popularity of YouTube stems from the authentic relationship creators have with their fans, according to Brittany Broski, 27, whose YouTube channel has more than 2 million subscribers. ""I still watch Netflix and HBO, where if I want a good fantasy series or whatever, I know where to go for that. But what YouTube is more concerned with is in this digital age, we've lost a sense of community and a sense of third spaces where we can go to hang out and meet new friends,"" Broski said. Broski's audience, which she described as Generation Z and young millennial women and members of the LGBTQ+ community, ballooned during the pandemic. Stuck at home with limited social options, hundreds of thousands of people found Broski as they searched for fresh, real-time content. That personal relationship is YouTube's secret sauce, and it doesn't translate when creators port to other services, Broski said. ""You're betraying your audience,"" said Broski. ""You're leaving YouTube to act, and then you're not posting online anymore, and you're asking them to wait on a project that's in development for what? A year, two years? People are going to forget about you, girl. That's how the internet works.""

The business model of YouTube for successful creators incentivizes staying on the platform. YouTube has shared more than $70 billion with its creators over the last three years through its Partner Program, which shares advertising revenue with more than 3 million channels on the platform. ""Why would I create a show and sell it to a network when I could just put it on YouTube?"" Broski said. ""You're self-funding, but if the money you're making from AdSense is going right back into your content to make more money, why do you even have to contact that third party?"" YouTube also benefits from a low barrier to entry to create content and from instant feedback through comments from fans that often help shape future content immediately. That model can't be replicated in a scripted form, where full seasons of TV shows are premade and rolled out on specific schedules. ""In the traditional industry, it's about proving to other people that the content deserves to be made, deserves to be seen, deserves a marketing campaign, deserves dollars behind it,"" said YouTube star and former professional cyclist Michelle Khare, 31, whose channel has more than 4.5 million subscribers. ""With YouTube, if you have the drive, the ability, and in many cases, your phone, you can skip those steps and put it out into a democratic platform where the audience ultimately decides what rises to the top.""

Morgan Stanley is pushing further into its adoption of artificial intelligence with a new assistant that is expected to take over thousands of hours of labor for the bank's financial advisors. The assistant, called Debrief, keeps detailed logs of advisors' meetings and automatically creates draft emails and summaries of the discussions, bank executives told CNBC. Morgan Stanley plans to release the program to the firm's roughly 15,000 advisors by early July, marking one of the most significant steps yet for the use of generative AI at a major Wall Street bank. While the company's earlier efforts involved creating a ChatGPT-like service to help advisors navigate the firm's reams of research, Debrief brings AI into direct contact with advisors' most prized resource: their relationships with rich clients. The program, built using OpenAI's GPT-4, essentially sits in on client Zoom meetings, replacing the note-taking that advisors or junior employees have been doing by hand, according to Jeff McMillan, Morgan Stanley's head of firmwide artificial intelligence. ""What we're finding is that the quality and depth of the notes are just significantly better,"" McMillan told CNBC. ""The truth is, this does a better job of taking notes than the average human.""

Consent required

Importantly, clients must consent to being recorded each time Debrief is used. Future versions will allow advisors to use the program on corporate devices during in-person meetings, said McMillan. The rollout will serve as a real-world test for the vaunted productivity gains of generative AI, which took Wall Street by storm in recent months and has bolstered the value of chipmakers, tech giants and the broader U.S. stock market. Morgan Stanley's wealth management division hosts about 1 million Zoom calls a year, the bank told CNBC. While estimates vary, one Morgan Stanley advisor involved in the Debrief pilot said the program saves 30 minutes of work per meeting; advisors typically spend time after meetings creating notes and action plans to address client needs.

""As a financial adviser I'm doing four, five or six meetings a day,"" said Don Whitehead, a Houston-based advisor who's been testing the software. By ""having the note-taking service built in through AI, you can really be invested in the meeting, you're actually a lot more present."" It remains to be seen what advisors will do with the hours reclaimed from essential grunt work. In a sense, Morgan Stanley's projects in generative AI amount to a ""grand experiment in productivity,"" said McMillan. If, as McMillan and others believe, advisors will spend more time serving clients and prospecting for new ones, the technology should boost Morgan Stanley's growth in assets under management, as well as retention of clients and advisors. Morgan Stanley's wealth management division is one of the world's largest with $5.5 trillion in client assets as of March; the firm wants to reach $10 trillion. It will take at least a year to determine whether the technology is boosting advisor productivity, McMillan said. ""I'm the analytics guy, but the advisors will tell you that they're at their best when they're engaging"" with clients, said McMillan. ""None of them will tell you they love taking notes or looking at research reports, right? That's not why they got into this business.""

CNBC,https://www.cnbc.com/2024/06/27/nike-nke-earnings-q4-2024.html,2024-06-28,15:11:44 UTC,"Nike shares plunge after retailer says quarterly sales will fall 10%, warns on China weakness","Nike shoes and logo are seen at a store in Nice, France on May 28, 2024.

Shares of Nike plunged on Friday after the retailer cut its full-year guidance and said it expects sales to drop 10% during its current quarter as it warned of soft sales in China and ""uneven"" consumer trends across the globe.

The expected 10% first-quarter slump is far below the 3.2% drop that analysts had expected, according to LSEG.

Nike shares plunged nearly 20% in trading Friday.

The sneaker giant, which reported quarterly earnings Thursday, now expects fiscal 2025 sales to be down mid-single digits, compared to analyst estimates of a 0.9% increase. Nike previously expected sales to grow. The company also expects sales in the first half to be down in the high single digits, compared to previous guidance of declines in the low single digits.

""A comeback at this scale takes time,"" the retailer's finance chief Matthew Friend said on a call with analysts Thursday. ""Although the next few quarters will be challenging, we are confident that we are repositioning Nike to be more competitive with a more balanced portfolio to drive sustainable, profitable, long-term growth.""

The company cut its guidance as it contends with slower online sales, planned declines in classic footwear franchises, ""increased macro uncertainty"" in the Greater China region and ""uneven consumer trends"" across Nike's markets, Friend said. It also expects sales into wholesalers to be slower as it scales new innovations and pulls back on classic franchises.

For the fiscal fourth quarter, the company handily beat earnings estimates as its cost-cutting efforts continue to bear fruit, but Nike fell short on revenue.

Here's how Nike did during the period compared with what Wall Street was anticipating, based on a survey of analysts by LSEG:

Earnings per share: $1.01 adjusted vs. 83 cents expected

$1.01 adjusted vs. 83 cents expected Revenue: $12.61 billion vs. $12.84 billion expected

The company's reported net income for the three-month period that ended May 31 was $1.5 billion, or 99 cents per share, compared with $1.03 billion, or 66 cents per share, a year earlier.

Sales dropped to $12.61 billion, down about 2% from $12.83 billion a year earlier.

In fiscal 2024, Nike posted sales of $51.36 billion, which is flat compared to the prior year. It's the slowest pace of annual sales growth the company has seen since 2010, excluding the Covid-19 pandemic.

Nike executives attributed the sales miss to a range of factors. They said its lifestyle business declined during the quarter and that momentum in its performance business, such as its basketball and running shoes, wasn't enough to offset it.

Online performance was soft because Nike had a higher share of lifestyle products, more promotions and fewer sales of classic franchises, such as its Air Force 1. It also saw traffic in China decline across all channels beginning in April due to macro conditions in the region.

Despite the traffic decline in China, sales in the region exceeded Wall Street expectations, according to StreetAccount, coming in at $1.86 billion, compared with estimates of $1.79 billion. It was the only geographical segment to top estimates for the period.

Sales in North America, its largest market, came in at $5.28 billion, below StreetAccount expectations of $5.45 billion.

In Europe, Middle East and Africa, Nike posted revenue of $3.29 billion, compared to estimates of $3.32 billion. In Asia Pacific and Latin America, Nike saw $1.71 billion in sales, compared to estimates of $1.77 billion.

Still, Friend later warned of the ""softer outlook"" in China and said had it not been for Chinese marketplace Tmall's early start to the region's 618 shopping holiday, sales in the country would've fallen short of Nike's internal expectations.

""The China marketplace remains highly promotional, and we continue to manage both Nike and partners' inventory carefully,"" said Friend. ""While our outlook for the near term has softened, we remain confident in Nike's competitive position in China in the long term.""

Nike's Converse brand was once again a significant underperformer in the overall results. The division saw revenue plunge 18% to $480 million, largely due to declines in North America and Western Europe.","Nike previously expected sales to grow.

The retail pharmacy giant now expects fiscal 2024 adjusted earnings of $2.80 to $2.95 per share. That compares with the company's previous outlook of between $3.20 and $3.35 per share.

""'We assumed ... in the second half that the consumer would get somewhat stronger"" but ""that is not the case,"" Walgreens CEO Tim Wentworth told CNBC.

He added that ""the consumer is absolutely stunned by the absolute prices of things, and the fact that some of them may not be inflating doesn't actually change their resistance to the current pricing. So we've had to get really keen, particularly in discretionary things.""

Still, Walgreens topped revenue estimates for the quarter on strong performance in its health-care segment. The company views that business division as critical to its ongoing push to transform from a major drugstore chain into a large health-care company.

The results come as Walgreens works to slash costs after a rocky last year marked by low pharmacy reimbursement rates, weakening demand for Covid products and a challenging macroeconomic environment.

The company on Friday said it is simplifying its U.S. health-care portfolio and finalizing plans to close underperforming U.S. stores over multiple years, among other ongoing cost-cutting efforts.

""Seventy-five percent of our stores drive 100% of our profitability today,"" Wentworth said. ""What that means is the others we take a hard look at, we are going to finalize a number that we will close.""

Here's what Walgreens reported for the three-month period ended May 31 compared with what Wall Street was expecting, based on a survey of analysts by LSEG:

Earnings per share: 63 cents adjusted vs. 68 cents expected

63 cents adjusted vs. 68 cents expected Revenue: $36.4 billion vs. $35.94 billion expected

Walgreens booked sales of $36.4 billion for the quarter, up 2.6% from the same period a year ago.

The company reported net income of $344 million, or 40 cents per share, for the quarter. That compares with net income of $118 million, or 14 cents per share, for the same period a year ago.

Excluding certain items, adjusted earnings were 63 cents per share for the quarter.

The stock pared losses slightly to trade down 13% by 9:00 a.m. London time.

The world's second largest retailer said operating profit for the period between March and May came in at 7.1 billion Swedish kroner ($672 million), below the 7.37 billion Swedish kroner anticipated by analysts, according to an LSEG poll cited by Reuters.

The second-quarter result was nevertheless above the 4.7 billion Swedish kroner recorded in the same period last year.

The company also said that bad weather was likely to dampen sales in June, which it expects to decline by 6% in local currencies, compared with the same period of last year.

Further weighing on stock, H&M CEO Daniel Ervér cast doubt over the company's ability to meet its margin target this year.

""Our goal of an operating margin of 10 percent for full-year 2024 remains in place,"" he said. ""However, the conditions for achieving that level this year have become more challenging as it is assessed that external factors that influence our purchasing costs and sales revenues, including materials and foreign currency, will have a more negative impact than we expected in the second half of the year.""

He added that the company was continuing to invest in both its online and in store experiences, with upgrades to stores in Paris, Milan, Berlin, Stockholm, Hamburg and Munich to follow those already undertaken in New York, London and Tokyo.

It comes as higher living costs and a slowdown in post-pandemic spending have weighed on both high street and luxury retail sales.

Micron shares fell about 7% in extended trading on Wednesday as investors looked past better-than-expected results and focused instead on a revenue forecast that was in line with estimates.

Here's how the company did versus LSEG consensus estimates for the fiscal third quarter ended May 30:

Earnings per share : 62 cents adjusted vs. 51 cents expected

: 62 cents adjusted vs. 51 cents expected Revenue: $6.81 billion vs. $6.67 billion expected

Micron, which makes computer memory and storage, said it expects adjusted earnings per share of $1.08 on revenue of $7.6 billion in the current quarter. Analysts were expecting earnings per share of $1.05 on revenue of $7.6 billion.

The shares have more than doubled in the past year as the company rides the artificial intelligence boom. Micron's most advanced memory is needed for AI graphics processing units (GPUs) like Nvidia's , putting the company in position to benefit from demand for technology to train and deploy AI applications like OpenAI's ChatGPT.

Micron reported $332 million in net income, or 30 cents per share, versus a net loss of $1.9 billion, or $1.73 per share, in the year-ago quarter.

Micron CEO Sanjay Mehrotra highlighted the company's AI business in a statement while saying that its smartphone and PC markets remain sluggish.

Mehrotra said the company's AI-oriented products were likely to increase in price and that the company's data center business grew 50% on a quarter-to-quarter basis.

""Robust AI-driven demand for data center products is causing tightness on our leading-edge nodes,"" Mehrotra said in a statement. ""Consequently, we expect continued price increases throughout calendar 2024 despite only steady near-term demand in PCs and smartphones.""

On a call with analysts, Micron said that its high bandwidth memory, the kind used in AI chips, is sold out through 2025.

""We believe that Micron will be one of the biggest beneficiaries in the semiconductor industry in the multiyear growth opportunity driven by AI,"" Mehrotra said.

Sales rose to $1.44 billion, up about 8% from $1.34 billion a year earlier. However, the sales jump was coming off of an easier comparison.

In the year-ago period, sales were down 9% after Levi's shifted its wholesale shipments from its fiscal second quarter into its fiscal first quarter. The shift reduced sales last year by about $100 million, the company said previously. Excluding the shift, as well as the exit of Levi's Denizen business, sales would have been up by only about 1% in its most recent quarter compared to the year-ago period.

Finance chief Harmit Singh attributed the sales miss to unfavorable foreign exchange conditions and weak sales at Docker's. During the quarter, the khaki and chinos brand saw $82.4 million in sales, up 8.6% from $75.8 million in the year ago period. It's not clear how sales at Docker's were affected by the timing of Levi's wholesale orders.

""People are generally cautious,"" Singh told CNBC in an interview. ""It's not necessarily an environment where people are buying a lot, people are cautious.""

While Levi's posted a strong earnings beat, it only reaffirmed its full-year guidance, which was in line with estimates. The company continues to expect full-year earnings per share to be between $1.17 and $1.27, which now includes a 5-cent hit coming from the company's new distribution and logistics strategy.

Levi's said it is transitioning from a primarily owned-and-operated distribution and logistics network in the U.S. and Europe to one that relies more on third parties.

""In the near term, these changes require the parallel operation of new and old facilities for the rest of 2024, resulting in a transitory increase in distribution costs,"" the company said.

The change allows Levi's to shift the responsibility of final mile delivery to third parties. The denim maker noted that it has new terms with its supplier that result in Levi's taking ownership of inventory closer to the point of shipment rather than its eventual destination. Levi's distribution network was built for a business that primarily sold to wholesalers, and now it needs to change into one that's more focused on selling directly to consumers.

The changes are necessary because nearly half of Levi's sales these days are coming from its own website and stores.

Direct-to-consumer sales jumped 8% during the quarter, representing 47% of overall sales. Online sales increased 19%.

""Our transformational pivot to operating as a DTC-first company is yielding positive results around the world, giving me great confidence that we will achieve accelerated, profitable growth for the rest of the year and beyond,"" CEO Michelle Gass said in a statement.

During the quarter, wholesale revenue grew 7%, but excluding the shift in timing of wholesale orders, sales in the channel decreased 4%. Singh noted that wholesale revenue improved on a sequential basis, but the company has a ""conservative"" view of the channel's growth moving forward.

By building out its own direct channels, Levi's enjoys higher profits, better data on its consumers and less reliance on shaky wholesalers like Macy's and Kohl's, which are continuing to shrink and fall out of favor with consumers.

However, selling directly can also be more expensive, and can come with unexpected hiccups that can impact sales and drain profits. For example, when someone buys a pair of Levi's from Macy's and wants to return them, Macy's typically bears that cost. Under a direct model, that responsibility, including the cost and logistics, would fall on Levi's.

Nike has come to be known as a cautionary tale for retailers long reliant on wholesalers that try to expand direct sales.

For a while, Nike's focus on direct sales boosted revenue and profits, but some critics said the strategy shift led to a slowdown in innovation, and ultimately, market share losses.

Recently, the company acknowledged that it erred when it cut off so many of its wholesale partners and said it has since ""corrected"" that.

Here's how the company did in its fiscal fourth quarter compared with what Wall Street was anticipating, based on a survey of analysts by LSEG:

Earnings per share : $5.41 adjusted vs. $5.35 expected

: $5.41 adjusted vs. $5.35 expected Revenue: $22.11 billion vs. $22.07 billion expected

The company reported net income for the three-month period that ended May 31 of $1.47 billion, or $5.94 per share, compared with $1.54 billion, or $6.05 per share, a year earlier.

Revenue rose to $22.1 billion, up slightly from $21.9 billion a year earlier. For the full fiscal year, revenue was $87.7 billion, down from $90.2 billion.

FedEx reported that capital spending for fiscal 2024 was $5.2 billion, down 16% from $6.2 billion in fiscal 2023 and less than the $5.7 billion it forecasted in its fiscal 2024 guidance last year.

For fiscal 2025, the company said it expects low to mid-single-digit revenue growth year over year, driven in large part by e-commerce and low-inventory levels, FedEx Chief Customer Officer Brie Carere said on the company's earnings call.

""We think e-commerce is going to outpace the B2B growth,"" Carere said. ""We like the fundamentals from an e-commerce perspective that will help us here in the United States and around the world.""

The capital spending decline comes as the company amps up its cost-cutting measures as part of a sweeping commitment to cut $4 billion by the end of fiscal 2025.

Following weak freight demand, FedEx enacted its DRIVE transformation program to cut costs and consolidate the business.

""DRIVE continues to change the way we work at FedEx. We achieved our target of $1.8 billion in structural costs out in fiscal year '24,"" CEO Raj Subramaniam said on the call.

Subramaniam said the company is firmly on track to achieve the $4 billion cost-cutting goal and further expects another $2 billion from the company's plans to consolidate its air and ground services.

As part of the DRIVE initiative, FedEx announced in April 2023 that it will be consolidating its delivery companies Express, Ground, Services and others into a unified Federal Express Corporation, operating under the FedEx brand and alongside the company's Freight segment which will continue to exist separately. The company said at the time that it expects the combined delivery business to handle all deliveries starting June 2024.

The newly combined segments are expected to be the larger driver of fiscal year 2025 adjusted income and margin improvement, finance chief John Dietrich said on the call.

FedEx further expects the demand environment to moderately improve through the next fiscal year, according to Carere.

Investor's eyes are also on the company's largest segment Express, which has been struggling with margin growth the past year. The segment's margins ended the fourth quarter at 4.1%, unchanged year over year. Its operating margin for fiscal 2024 was 2.6%, up slightly from 2.5% last year.

Subramaniam said improving performance of the Express segment is a ""top priority"" for the company.

While the company hiked its quarterly dividend by 10% earlier this month, investors do foresee headwinds, particularly after the company lost its U.S. Postal Service contract to rival United Parcel Service n April.

UPS will become the primary air cargo provider for USPS starting Sept. 30, after FedEx's contract expires. USPS was the largest customer for the company's Express segment. The company shared that it expects a $500 million headwind from the loss in fiscal 2025.","FedEx shares soared more than 15% after hours Tuesday after the company reported results that topped analysts' estimates in both earnings and revenue.

The Financial Action Task Force, an international watchdog organization dedicated to combating money laundering and illicit cash flows, on Friday removed Turkey from its ""gray list"" of countries that need special monitoring, handing a major vote of confidence to the country in the midst of its economic turnaround efforts.

In a lyric on her latest album, Beyoncé sings ""denim on denim, on denim, on denim."" Levi Strauss shoppers are taking that advice to heart. Levi Strauss executives are ecstatic. Western wear is booming as consumers opt for top-to-bottom denim looks, the iconic, 171-year-old clothing maker said on Wednesday. As the style wins cultural favor, its popularity is juicing denim niches — like shirts, skirts and dresses — that fall outside Levi's widely-known blue jean offerings. ""The growing popularity of Western wear is at an all-time high,"" CEO Michelle Gass told analysts Wednesday night after the California-based retailer's latest earnings report for the quarter ended in May. A Western renaissance has been gaining traction over the past several months, sending stylish shoppers searching for pieces like jeans, boots and cowboy hats. Levi's scored a huge hit when its jean brand was referenced in Beyoncé's song ""Levii's Jeans,"" released earlier this year. Beyond Beyoncé's chart-topping ""Cowboy Carter"" album, the increased ubiquity of Western style has also been tied to a fashion line unveiled by Louis Vuitton earlier this year and Taylor Swift's ongoing Eras Tour.

Gass, who took over as Levi Strauss CEO earlier this year after previously serving as the CEO at Kohl's , has touted that denim is having a moment in the popular imagination, with Western wear trending more broadly throughout the culture. More specific data shared on the company's earnings call Wednesday showed how Levi Strauss is taking advantage of demand for denim beyond its popular ""501"" jeans. Sales of denim skirts, jumpsuits and dresses all at least doubled in the latest quarter, Gass said. Western shirts sales are also up significantly, she said, especially on the women's side. Levi is find success in what the 55-year-old chief executive described as a new strategy of trying to dress customers denim — from head-to-toe. ""Our new focus is, yes, continuing to own jeans, but taking that denim top to bottom,"" Gass said on CNBC's ""Mad Money"" late Wednesday. While noting that the denim skirt and dress categories haven't been historically large for the company, now ""they're exploding,"" she said.

Denim rage sets a high bar on Wall Street

To be sure, the well-documented denim craze alone isn't necessarily impressing Wall Street. Levi Strauss tumbled more than 15% on Thursday in response to its latest numbers, its second worst day since going public in early 2019. Levi Strauss posted $1.44 billion in revenue in the fiscal second quarter, slightly missing the $1.45 billion consensus forecast of analysts polled by LSEG despite the denim boom. The company's finance chief told CNBC that the sales miss was driven by unfavorable foreign exchange rates and weakness in the Dockers brand. On the other hand, Levi Strauss earned 16 cents per share, excluding items, ahead of the 11-cent average estimate by analysts. In the year through Wednesday, shares had run up amid the buzz around the cotton-based fabric and the resurgence of Western clothing. Following Thursday's drop, the stock is still up more than 18% on the year. For comparison, shares of Kontoor Brands , the parent of denim brands Wrangler and Lee, have risen 5% year to date.

CNBC,https://www.cnbc.com/2024/06/28/may-pce-inflation-report.html,2024-06-28,19:35:23 UTC,"Key Fed measure shows inflation rose 2.6% in May from a year ago, as expected","Including food and energy, headline inflation was flat on the month and also up 2.6% on an annual basis. Those readings also were in line with expectations.

Both numbers were in line with the Dow Jones estimates. May marked the lowest annual rate since March 2021, which was the first time in this economic cycle that inflation topped the Fed's 2% target.

The core personal consumption expenditures price index increased just a seasonally adjusted 0.1% for the month and was up 2.6% from a year ago, the latter number down 0.2 percentage point from the April level, according to a Commerce Department report .

An important economic measure for the Federal Reserve showed Friday that inflation during May slowed to its lowest annual rate in more than three years.

""It is just additional news that monetary policy is working, inflation is gradually cooling,"" San Francisco Fed President Mary Daly told CNBC's Andrew Ross Sorkin during a ""Squawk Box"" interview. ""That's a relief for businesses and households who've been struggling with persistently high inflation. It's good news for how policy is working.""

The Fed focuses on the PCE inflation reading as opposed to the more widely followed consumer price index from the Labor Department's Bureau of Labor Statistics. PCE is a broader inflation measure and accounts for changes in consumer behavior, such as substituting their purchases when prices rise.

While the central bank officially follows headline PCE, officials generally stress the core reading as a better gauge of longer-term inflation trends.

Outside of the inflation numbers, the Bureau of Economic Analysis report showed that personal income rose 0.5% on the month, stronger than the 0.4% estimate. Consumer spending, however, increased 0.2%, weaker than the 0.3% forecast.

Prices were held in check during the month by a 0.4% decline for goods and a 2.1% slide in energy, which offset a 0.2% increase in services and a 0.1% gain for food.

However, housing prices continued to rise, up 0.4% on the month for the fourth straight time. Shelter-related costs have proven stickier than Federal Reserve officials have anticipated and have helped keep the central bank from reducing interest rates as expected this year.

Stock market futures were modestly positive following the report while Treasury yields were negative on the session.

Investors have been trying to handicap the Fed's intentions on rates this year and have had to scale back expectations. Whereas traders earlier in 2024 had been expecting at least six rate cuts this year they are now pricing in just two, starting in September. Fed officials at their June meeting penciled in just one reduction this year.

""The lack of surprise in today's PCE number is a relief and will be welcomed by the Fed,"" said Seema Shah, chief global strategist at Principal Asset Management. ""However, the policy path is not yet certain. A further deceleration in inflation, ideally coupled with additional evidence of labor market softening, will be necessary to pave the way for a first rate cut in September.""

The Fed targets 2% inflation and began raising interest rates in March 2022 after a year of dismissing rising prices as transitory effects from the Covid pandemic that likely would fade. The central bank last raised rates in July 2023 after taking its benchmark overnight borrowing level to a range of 5.25%-5.50%, the highest in some 23 years.

Recent economic data has painted a picture of an economy that has withstood the Fed's aggressive monetary tightening. Gross domestic product rose at a 1.4% annualized rate in the first quarter and is on pace to increase 2.2% in the second quarter, according to the Atlanta Fed.

There have been some slight cracks in the labor market lately, with continuing jobless claims hitting their highest level since November 2021. However, the unemployment rate is still 4%, low by historical means though also rising at a slow pace.","Including food and energy, headline inflation was flat on the month and also up 2.6% on an annual basis.

Here's what to expect,"People purchase beverages in a store on a sweltering afternoon in Brooklyn, New York, on the first day of summer on June 21, 2024.

The official Dow Jones forecasts for Friday's numbers are for the headline, or all-item, PCE price reading to come in flat on the month, while core is projected to rise 0.1%. That would compare to respective increases of 0.3% and 0.2% in April . Both headline and core are forecast at 2.6% on a year-over-year basis.

If that date rings a bell, it's when core PCE first passed the Fed's coveted 2% inflation target during this cycle. Despite a series of aggressive interest rate increases since then, the central bank has yet to wrest the pace of price increases back into its target range.

But even more importantly, when stripping out volatile food and energy prices, the core PCE price index, which draws even closer scrutiny from Fed policymakers, is set to indicate its lowest annual reading since March 2021.

The personal consumption expenditures price index, an inflation measure the Federal Reserve watches closely, is expected to show little, if any, monthly increase for May, the first time that would be the case since November 2023.

There could be some pretty good inflation news on the way from the Commerce Department when it releases a key economic report Friday.

Should the core PCE price forecasts transpire, it will serve as a milestone of sorts.

""We are in line with [the forecast] that the PCE core pricing data will come in soft,"" said Beth Ann Bovino, chief economist at U.S. Bank. ""That's good news for the Fed. It's also good for people's pocketbooks, although I don't know if people feel it just yet.""

Indeed, while the rate of inflation has receded precipitously from its mid-2022 peak, prices have not. Since that March 2021 benchmark, core PCE is up 14%.

That steep climb and its pernicious effect is why Fed officials are not ready to declare victory yet, despite the obvious progress made since the rate hikes began in March 2022.

""Returning inflation sustainably to our 2% target is an ongoing process and not a fait accompli,"" Fed Governor Lisa Cook said earlier this week.

Cook and her colleagues have been circumspect about the timing and pace of rate cuts, though most agree that easing is likely at some point this year as long as the data stays in line. Futures markets are currently pricing in a good likelihood that the Fed will enact its first quarter-percentage-point cut in September, with another to follow by the end of the year. Policymakers at their meeting earlier this month penciled in just one cut.

""We do expect softening in the real economy — not falling off a cliff, just softening — that suggests that inflation will be softer as well later on. That gives us reason to expect the Fed will be able to likely have their first cut in September,"" Bovino said.

""Now we all know it depends on the data and the Fed is still watching,"" she added. ""Could they wait? Could it just be a one and done this year? I can't rule it out. But it does look like the numbers might give the Fed cover to cut rates two times this year.""

In addition to the inflation numbers, the Commerce Department at 8:30 a.m. ET will release figures on personal income and consumer spending, with estimates at a rise of 0.4% and 0.3%, respectively.","If that date rings a bell, it's when core PCE first passed the Fed's coveted 2% inflation target during this cycle.

The annual survey conducted by the China General Chamber of Commerce in the U.S. found that nearly 60% of companies aim to maintain a stable level of investment and that about 30% plan to boost it.

""A notable degree of long-term optimism persisted, with the majority expressing positive future revenue expectations,"" CGCC said, adding that the survey reflected ""a commendable sense of optimism, determination, and resilience.""

The survey was conducted in April and May of this year, polling nearly 100 Chinese companies across various industries about performance and outlook.

The report said Chinese firms remain committed to the U.S. market despite growing negative sentiment about the overall business environment amid rising trade tensions between the world's two largest economies.

Over the past year, the Biden administration has ramped up curbs on Chinese businesses, scrutinizing certain China-dominated industries, placing new sanctions on various Chinese firms and goods and trying to outright block Chinese ownership of certain companies and platforms.","A recent survey of Chinese enterprises in the U.S. has found that a majority remain bullish on the market long term despite growing concerns about U.S.-China relations and the broader business environment.

CNBC,https://www.cnbc.com/2024/06/25/fed-governor-bowman-says-shes-still-open-to-raising-rates-if-inflation-doesnt-improve.html,2024-06-25,16:07:05 UTC,Fed Governor Bowman says she's still open to raising rates if inflation doesn't improve,"Michelle Bowman, governor of the US Federal Reserve, speaks during the Exchequer Club meeting in Washington, DC, US, on Wednesday, Feb. 21, 2024.

Federal Reserve Governor Michelle Bowman said Tuesday the time is not right yet to start lowering interest rates, adding she would be open to raising if inflation doesn't pull back.

""Should the incoming data indicate that inflation is moving sustainably toward our 2 percent goal, it will eventually become appropriate to gradually lower the federal funds rate to prevent monetary policy from becoming overly restrictive,"" Bowman said in prepared remarks for a speech in London. ""However, we are still not yet at the point where it is appropriate to lower the policy rate.""

Those comments reflect a prevailing sentiment at the central bank, in which most policymakers have said in recent weeks that, while they still expect inflation to get back to the Fed's 2% target, they need more evidence.

Recent readings have shown moderating inflation, with the Fed's preferred indicator running just under 3%. However, the rate-setting Federal Open Market Committee noted after its last meeting that there has been only ""modest further progress.""

Bowman noted that there are ""a number of upside risks"" prevailing that could accelerate her outlook, which is among the most hawkish of all policymakers.

""I remain willing to raise the target range for the federal funds rate at a future meeting should progress on inflation stall or even reverse,"" she said. ""Given the risks and uncertainties regarding my economic outlook, I will remain cautious in my approach to considering future changes in the stance of policy.""

The Commerce Department on Friday will release its reading on the May personal consumption expenditures price index, the Fed's preferred inflation gauge. Economists surveyed by Dow Jones expect a 12-month inflation rate of 2.6% on both the all-items and core, which excludes food and energy prices.

While that would represent a nudge lower from April, Bowman said she still expects the Fed to hold its key overnight borrowing rate in a range between 5.25%-5.50% ""for some time.""

Moreover, she indicated she is not being swayed by rate reductions from the Fed's global counterparts such as the European Central Bank, which recently lowered its key rates by a quarter percentage point. Bowman said ""it is possible over the coming months that the path of monetary policy in the U.S. will diverge from that of other advanced economies.""

In other Fed news Tuesday, Governor Lisa Cook expressed optimism that inflation would show more significant progress in 2025, allowing the Fed to lower rates at some point.

""With significant progress on inflation and the labor market cooling gradually, at some point it will be appropriate to reduce the level of policy restriction to maintain a healthy balance in the economy,"" Cook told the Economic Club of New York.

While Cook said she is optimistic that inflation will head lower and supply and demand in the labor market is coming into better balance, she also noted that risk factors remain. They include higher credit card delinquency rates and tighter credit conditions, along with the difficulty in assessing economic data that has come under continuous and significant revision.

Both officials' remarks follow other policymakers saying Monday that they're hesitant to cut.

San Francisco Fed President Mary Daly rejected the idea of doing a preemptive cut to hedge against deterioration in the labor market and a slowing economy.

""I do think that preemptive cutting is something that you do when you see risks,"" Daly told CNBC's Deirdre Bosa during a public event in San Francisco. ""We're going to be resolute until we finish the job. That's why not taking preemptive action when it's not necessary is so important.""

Also, Chicago Fed President Austan Goolsbee told CNBC's Steve Liesman earlier on Monday that if he sees ""more months"" of good inflation data, then he would question whether policy needs to be as restrictive as it has been, paving the way for cuts.

As governors, Cook and Bowman are permanent FOMC voters. Daly also gets a vote this year while Goolsbee does not, though he does get a voice at meetings and submits his forecast to the committee's

CNBC,https://www.cnbc.com/2024/06/30/top-wall-street-analysts-favor-these-dividend-stocks-for-better-returns.html,2024-06-30,10:55:21 UTC,Top Wall Street analysts favor these dividend stocks for better returns,"A sign is posted in front of an Olive Garden restaurant on June 20, 2024 in Rohnert Park, California.

Dividend-paying stocks can help investors bolster their portfolios and boost returns.

Investors searching for these names will need to find companies that have a track record of making steady payments, backed by robust financials.

Here are three attractive dividend stocks, according to Wall Street's top pros on TipRanks, a platform that ranks analysts based on their past performance.

Darden Restaurants

The first dividend stock is Darden Restaurants (DRI), which operates several popular brands in full-service dining, including Olive Garden, LongHorn Steakhouse and Yard House. The company recently announced mixed results for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2024. While Darden exceeded analysts' earnings expectations, its sales slightly missed the Street's consensus amid increased discounting by rivals.

Darden issued $628 million in dividends and committed $454 million to share repurchases in fiscal 2024. Moreover, the company announced a dividend hike of nearly 7%, bringing the quarterly dividend to $1.40 per share. The stock has a dividend yield of 3.5%.

Following the results, BTIG analyst Peter Saleh reiterated a buy rating on DRI stock with a price target of $175. The analyst highlighted that at the mid-point, Darden's earnings per share outlook of $9.40 to $9.60 indicates double-digit total shareholder return, which is in line with the company's long-term targets.

Saleh thinks that the company can achieve its targeted return metrics, supported by several factors, including a modest rise in pricing, advertising initiatives and easing inflation.

""We view Darden Restaurants as one of the strongest operators in the industry with historical sales and restaurant margin performance that has consistently exceeded peers,"" said Saleh.

Saleh ranks No. 360 among more than 8,900 analysts tracked by TipRanks. His ratings have been successful 61% of the time, with each delivering an average return of 11.7%. (See Darden's Financial Statements on TipRanks)

International Seaways

Next up is International Seaways (INSW), a tanker company that offers energy transportation services for crude oil and petroleum products. On June 26, the company paid a combined dividend of $1.75 per share. The company's combined dividend represented 60% of its first-quarter adjusted net income.

In its first-quarter results, INSW highlighted that its combined dividend payments of $5.74 per share over the last twelve months reflected a dividend yield of more than 13%.

Following meetings with INSW's management, Stifel analyst Benjamin Nolan reaffirmed a buy rating on the stock and increased the price target to $68 from $66. The analyst noted that the tanker market remains cyclically strong due to a continued increase in global oil consumption, the limited supply of new ships and the longer average voyage lengths caused by the ongoing geopolitical troubles.

Accordingly, Nolan increased his rate assumptions for 2024 and 2025. The analyst expects International Seaways to continue to deliver higher cash flows, fueled by a favorable backdrop for the tanker market.

Nolan expects INSW to sustain high supplemental dividends, given the estimated $200 million to $300 million of excess cash flow after capital expenditure (assuming there is no new debt associated with tanker acquisitions). ""We are modeling $5.51/share in 2024 dividends, although there is room to be a little higher,"" said the analyst.

Nolan ranks No. 68 among more than 8,900 analysts tracked by TipRanks. His ratings have been successful 67% of the time, with each delivering an average return of 19.5%. (See International Seaways' Stock Charts on TipRanks)

Citigroup

Finally, let's discuss this week's third dividend stock, banking giant Citigroup (C). At a quarterly dividend of 53 cents per share, Citigroup offers a yield of 3.3%.

The bank held its Services Investor Day on June 18. Management expressed confidence about achieving the 2024 guidance, driven by revenue growth across all the core businesses despite macro uncertainty and the possibility of lower interest rates.

Following the event, Goldman Sachs analyst Richard Ramsden reiterated a buy rating on Citigroup stock and slightly raised his price target to $72 from $71. The higher price target reflects an increase in the analyst's EPS estimates for 2024, 2025 and 2026 based on management's commentary, which indicated that the bank's strategic transformation plan is gaining momentum.

Ramsden noted that Citi is highly focused on its transformation efforts, with the bank making steady progress on risk control and data quality. Coming to the Services business, the analyst noted that management established strategic priorities for this vital component of the company's financial targets. The analyst estimates that the Services business will account for 25% of the group revenue growth through 2026.

""The Services business is well positioned to maintain their market leading positions with potential to continue share gains across businesses,"" said Ramsden. The analyst's optimism is based on Citi's extensive global network in 95 countries, well-established long-term client relationships, and market share gains that are expected to be driven by investments in technology and innovative offerings.

Ramsden ranks No. 969 among more than 8,900 analysts tracked by TipRanks. His ratings have been successful 65% of the time, with each delivering an average return of 11.9%.

CNBC,https://www.cnbc.com/2024/06/29/two-paths-for-jana-to-bolster-shareholder-value-at-rapid7.html,2024-06-29,11:55:40 UTC,Activist Jana has a stake in Rapid7. There are two paths to bolster value at the cybersecurity company,"Business: Rapid7 is a global cybersecurity software and services provider. Its products span across information security, cloud operations, development and information technology teams, enabling them to understand attackers and leverage that information to take control of their fragmented attack surface. Rapid7 Managed Threat Complete is the company's flagship offering, and it includes the Rapid7 Managed Detection and Response program. Rapid7 also provides risk and threat coverage through InsightIDR and Insight VM services, making them available in a single package. Its security solutions help more than 11,000 global customers unite cloud risk management and threat detection.

Activist Commentary: Jana is a very experienced activist investor founded in 2001 by Barry Rosenstein. The firm made its name taking deeply researched activist positions with well-conceived plans for long term value. Rosenstein called his activist strategy ""V cubed."" The three ""Vs"" were"" (i) Value: buying at the right price; (ii) Votes: knowing whether you have the votes before commencing a proxy fight; and (iii) Variety of ways to win: having more than one strategy to enhance value and exit an investment. Since 2008, the firm has gradually shifted that strategy to one which we characterize as the three ""Ss"" (i) Stock price: buying at the right price; (ii) Strategic activism: sale of company or spinoff of a business; and (iii) Star advisors/nominees: aligning with top industry executives to advise them and take board seats if necessary.

Rapid7 is a cybersecurity company that expands the expertise of its clients' security operations. Its Managed Threat Complete flagship offering combines end-to-end 24/7 managed detection and response with vulnerability management offerings. Historically, the company has focused on on-site cybersecurity operations, but it has begun to expand into the explosive growth area of cloud security. Rapid7 operates in a highly attractive industry and is the beneficiary of some meaningful tailwinds. In a time where software budgets are being cut or reallocated toward AI, the threat of cyberattacks looms large and presents a great enough risk that spend is either flat or increasing for these types of services. In addition, cybersecurity analysts and internal security staff are limited, so there is a tremendous need for outsourcing. With more complex operations and numerous applications both on-site and in the cloud, Rapid7 is well-positioned to continue growing and aims to be a high-quality provider for subject matter experts who may not be able to retain the services of their largest and most expensive competitors.

Despite its favorable position, the company has delivered negative returns on a one-, three-, and five-year basis. Rapid7 is one of three main players in vulnerability management, yet it's assigned a much smaller revenue multiple (3x) compared to peers Tenable (5.5x) and Qualys (8x). One factor in this is that Rapid7 offers a combination of low- and high-growth cybersecurity offerings, which is difficult to value, but more important are the multiple slip-ups by management, exacerbated by a lack of oversight by the board. First, the company has undergone changes to its sales model, including a shift to selling packaged products from selling offerings individually. It's also moved to a channel model from direct. Next, the company has encountered challenges in bringing its cloud product to market. In addition, to shift from pure growth to a profitable software company, Rapid7 has focused on meeting targets for $160 million in free cash flow and improved margins. In August 2023, likely in pursuit of these goals, the company abruptly announced plans to reduce its staff by 18%. Rapid7 has had further retention problems in key executive roles, including the departure of its chief innovation officer and its critically important chief operating officer and president. Finally, the company has not been able to properly make forecasts, leading to tremendous investor uncertainty and questions of board oversight. In February 2024, the company announced its 2024 guidance, which it stated it was highly confident in, only to cut it in May when the company delivered its Q1 results. That led to a 17% stock price decline on May 8. This is a company operating in a highly complex and dynamic space – it is doing everything all at once and has seemingly failed to deliver.

With a company like this, there are generally two paths to shareholder value creation: (i) a long-term plan involving board reconstitution, management overhaul and review of strategic and operational plans and (ii) a shorter-term plan to sell the company to an interested buyer who can make those changes. With respect to the long-term plan, Jana generally works with industry executives and consultants in performing due diligence and implementing its activist plans, and we do not expect this situation to be different. The firm will often bring these individuals to the table to serve as director nominees, if deemed necessary. Jana is experienced in getting these experts on company boards, where they often serve as assets in getting the company to correct its issues, from operational to governance to capital allocation. But Jana also has extensive experience in strategic activism and getting portfolio companies sold. We expect that Jana will advocate for the strategy it expects will maximize shareholder value on a risk- and time-adjusted basis. Given the problems the company has been experiencing and the lack of CEO focus (Aside from being chairman and CEO of Rapid7, Corey Thomas is on the National Security Telecommunications Advisory Committee, chair of the Federal Reserve Bank of Boston and a member of the Council on Foreign Relations. He also serves on the boards of the Blue Cross Blue Shield of Massachusetts, LPL Financial and Vanderbilt University.), a sale looks like it could be the easier and more certain path if there is a suitor at the right price.

Given industry tailwinds, there may be several strategic and financial buyers interested in this company. Recent transactions in the cybersecurity sector include Cisco's $28 billion takeover of Splunk and Francisco Partners' $1.7 billion acquisition of Sumo Logic. If Jana does advocate for a sale of Rapid7, it will ask the board to do it through a full sales process that attains the highest value for shareholders. In addition, Jana has a strategic partnership with Cannae Holdings, which could be helpful in providing the equity in a strategic transaction with a private equity firm. Consider that in 2019, Cannae joined with private-equity firms to buy Dun & Bradstreet. It is important to note that even if Jana thinks a sale of the company is the best way to optimize shareholder value, the firm will still have to get the board to agree. This does not look like a board and management team that will just go quietly. In such a case, Jana's remedy would be to launch a proxy fight, but that could take some time. The 2024 annual meeting just passed on June 13 and the director nomination window does not open until Feb.13, 2025.

In a lyric on her latest album, Beyoncé sings ""denim on denim, on denim, on denim."" Levi Strauss shoppers are taking that advice to heart. Levi Strauss executives are ecstatic. Western wear is booming as consumers opt for top-to-bottom denim looks, the iconic, 171-year-old clothing maker said on Wednesday. As the style wins cultural favor, its popularity is juicing denim niches — like shirts, skirts and dresses — that fall outside Levi's widely-known blue jean offerings. ""The growing popularity of Western wear is at an all-time high,"" CEO Michelle Gass told analysts Wednesday night after the California-based retailer's latest earnings report for the quarter ended in May. A Western renaissance has been gaining traction over the past several months, sending stylish shoppers searching for pieces like jeans, boots and cowboy hats. Levi's scored a huge hit when its jean brand was referenced in Beyoncé's song ""Levii's Jeans,"" released earlier this year. Beyond Beyoncé's chart-topping ""Cowboy Carter"" album, the increased ubiquity of Western style has also been tied to a fashion line unveiled by Louis Vuitton earlier this year and Taylor Swift's ongoing Eras Tour.

Gass, who took over as Levi Strauss CEO earlier this year after previously serving as the CEO at Kohl's , has touted that denim is having a moment in the popular imagination, with Western wear trending more broadly throughout the culture. More specific data shared on the company's earnings call Wednesday showed how Levi Strauss is taking advantage of demand for denim beyond its popular ""501"" jeans. Sales of denim skirts, jumpsuits and dresses all at least doubled in the latest quarter, Gass said. Western shirts sales are also up significantly, she said, especially on the women's side. Levi is find success in what the 55-year-old chief executive described as a new strategy of trying to dress customers denim — from head-to-toe. ""Our new focus is, yes, continuing to own jeans, but taking that denim top to bottom,"" Gass said on CNBC's ""Mad Money"" late Wednesday. While noting that the denim skirt and dress categories haven't been historically large for the company, now ""they're exploding,"" she said.

Denim rage sets a high bar on Wall Street

To be sure, the well-documented denim craze alone isn't necessarily impressing Wall Street. Levi Strauss tumbled more than 15% on Thursday in response to its latest numbers, its second worst day since going public in early 2019. Levi Strauss posted $1.44 billion in revenue in the fiscal second quarter, slightly missing the $1.45 billion consensus forecast of analysts polled by LSEG despite the denim boom. The company's finance chief told CNBC that the sales miss was driven by unfavorable foreign exchange rates and weakness in the Dockers brand. On the other hand, Levi Strauss earned 16 cents per share, excluding items, ahead of the 11-cent average estimate by analysts. In the year through Wednesday, shares had run up amid the buzz around the cotton-based fabric and the resurgence of Western clothing. Following Thursday's drop, the stock is still up more than 18% on the year. For comparison, shares of Kontoor Brands , the parent of denim brands Wrangler and Lee, have risen 5% year to date.

CNBC,https://www.cnbc.com/2024/06/26/your-401k-is-up-but-a-new-report-says-americans-need-to-save-more-.html,2024-06-26,11:00:06 UTC,"Your 401(k) is up, and a new report shows increased savings. But Americans need to do more","How's your 401(k) looking? A new report shows Americans are saving more, but probably need to do even more.

Vanguard has released its annual report, How America Saves 2024. Vanguard and Fidelity are the two biggest sponsors of 401(k) plans, and this is a snapshot of what nearly five million participants are doing with their money.

The good news: stock market returns are up and, thanks largely to automatic enrollment plans, investors are saving more than they did in the past.

The bad news: account balances for the median 401(k) of a person approaching retirement (65+) remains very low.

The takeaway: Americans are still very reliant on Social Security for a large chunk of their retirement.

Higher returns, participation rates, savings rates

Why do we care so much about 401(k) plans? Because it's the main private savings vehicle Americans have for retirement. More than 100 million Americans are covered by these ""defined contribution"" plans, with more than $10 trillion in assets.

First, 2023 was a good year to be an investor. The average total return rate for participants was 18.1%, the best year since 2019.

But to be effective vehicles for retirement, these plans need to: 1) have high participation rates, and 2) hold high levels of savings.

On those fronts, there is good news. John James, managing director of Vanguard's Institutional Investor Group, called it ""a year of progress.""

Plan participation reached all-time highs. Thanks to a change in the law several years ago, a record-high 59% of plans offered automatic enrollment in 401(k) plans. This is a major improvement: ipreviously, enrollment in 401(k) plans were often short of expectations because investors had to ""opt-in,"" that is they had to choose to participate in the plan. Because of indecision or simple ignorance, many did not. By switching to automatic enrollment, participants were automatically enrolled and had to ""opt-out"" if they did not want to participate.

The result: enrollment rates have gone up. Plans with automatic enrollment had a 94% participation rate, compared with 67% for voluntary enrollment plans.

Participant saving rates reached all time highs. The average participant deferred 7.4% of their savings. Including employee and employer contributions, the average total participant contribution rate was 11.7%.

A few other observations about Vanguard's 401(k) plan investors:

They prefer equities and target date funds. They love equities over bonds or any other investments. The average plan contribution to equities is 74%. A record-high 64% of all 2023 contributions went into target-date funds, which automatically adjust stock and bond allocations as the participant ages.

They don't trade much. In 2023, only 5% of nonadvised participants traded within their accounts; 95% did no trading at all. ""Over the past 15 years, we have generally observed a decline in participant trading,"" Vanguard said, which it partially attributed to increased adoption of target-date funds.

Despite gains in the market, account balances are still low

In 2023, the average account balance for Vanguard participants was $134,128, but the median balance (half had more, half had less) was only $35,286.

Why such a big difference between the average and the median? Because a small group of investors with large balances pull up the averages. Forty percent of participants had less than $20,000 in their retirement accounts.

Distribution of account balances

Less than $20,000 40%

$20,000-$99,999 30%

$100,000-$249,900 15%

$250,000 + 15%

Source: Vanguard

Median balances for those near retirement are still low

A different way to look at the problem is to ask how much people who are retirement age have saved, because it's an indication of how prepared they are for imminent retirement.

Investors 65 years or older had an average account balance of $272,588, but a median balance of only $88,488.

A median balance of $88,488 is not much when you consider older participants have higher incomes and higher savings rates. That is not much money for a 65-year old nearing retirement.

Of course, these balances don't necessarily reflect total lifetime savings. Some have more than one retirement plan because they had other plans with previous employers. Most do have other sources of retirement savings, typically Social Security. A shrinking number may also have a pension. Some may have money in checking accounts, or have stocks or bonds outside a retirement account.

Regardless, the math does not look great

So let's do some retirement math.

A typical annual drawdown for a 401(k) account in retirement is about 4%. Drawing down 4% of $88,488 a year gets you $3,539 every 12 months.

Next, Social Security. As of January 2023, the average Social Security benefit was almost $1,689 per month, or about $20,268 per year.

Finally, even though pensions are a vanishing benefit, let's include them.

According to the Pension Rights Center, the median annual pension benefit for a private pension is $9,262 (government employees have higher benefits).

Here's our yearly retirement budget:

Personal savings $3,539

Pension $9,262

Social Security $20,264

Total: $33,065

It's certainly possibly to live on $33,000 a year, but this would likely only work if you own your home, have low expenses and live in a low-cost part of the country.

Even then, it would hardly be a robust retirement.

And these are the lucky ones. Only 57% of retirees have a tax-deferred retirement account like a 401(k) or IRA. Only 56% reported receiving income from a pension.

And that extra income largely determines whether a retiree feels good or bad about their retirement.

In 2023, four out five retirees said they were doing at least okay financially, but this varied tremendously depending on whether retirees had sources of income outside of Social Security. Only 52% of retirees who did not have private income said they were doing at least okay financially.

What can be done?

To have a more robust retirement, Americans are just going to have to save more.

One issue is investors still don't contribute the maximum amount allowed. Only 14% of participants saved the statutory maximum amount of $22,500 per year ($30,000 for those age 50 or older). The likely reason: most felt they couldn't afford to.

However, only 53% of even those with income over $150,000 contributed the maximum allowed. Given that the employee match is ""free money,"" one would think participants in that income bracket would rationally choose to max out their contribution. The fact that many still don't suggests that more investor education is needed.

Regardless, it's very dangerous to assume that retirees are going to be bailed out by an ever-rising stock market. Another year anywhere near 2022, when the S&P 500 was down 20%, and investor confidence in their financial future will likely deteriorate.","The bad news: account balances for the median 401(k) of a person approaching retirement (65+) remains very low.

Comfort, known for his viral videos and engaging Gospel-sharing, recently sent a gift basket to the civil rights group after the organization sued Lousiana over its decision to become the first U.S. state to mandate the Ten Commandments be displayed in public school classrooms.

Listen to the latest episode of “Quick Start”

Rather than deride the ACLU, Comfort offered a “thank you” for giving massive and renewed cultural attention to the famed biblical commandments.

“The ACLU, in wanting to sue the state of Louisiana, have done us a great favor,” he told CBN News. “Their lawsuit was big news in the secular media, and so the Ten Commandments have featured from Newsweek to Time magazine, USA Today, to The New York Times, CNN, MSNBC, NBC, ABC, Fox, on huge podcasts, ‘The View,’ all throughout social media, and comedian Jimmy Kimmel even quoted all of the Ten Commandments to his massive viewing audience. You can’t buy that sort of publicity!”

Considering this inadvertent “gift,” Comfort decided to send the ACLU a large basket filled with chocolate and a thank-you card.

That card included a message that read, “Thank you for publicizing The Ten Commandments. America needs to be reminded of God’s Law, and you’ve certainly done that. Very grateful.”

The ACLU reportedly hasn’t responded to the gesture and note, but Comfort said he doesn’t expect the organization to do so. Comfort has long advocated for Christians — and humans more generally — to pay attention to the Ten Commandments and implement these moral truths into their lives.

He told CBN News that Americans today can learn a great deal by studying biblical Israel and understanding its timeless parallels to our current situation.

“America is no different than Israel in the Old Testament who forgot the Ten Commandments, and consequently gave themselves to sin,” Comfort said. “And the reason they did so was because of the sin of ‘idolatry.'”

He continued, “When we forsake the Law that forbids making up false gods and committing adultery, we tend to make up our own congenial image of God and run headlong into sexual sin. And that’s what’s happened to the United States.”

Comfort believes the only catalyst for awakening Americans to their national sin is a “fresh look at the Ten Commandments.” In fact, Comfort’s ministry, Living Waters, has spent four decades teaching Christians about the importance of the Ten Commandments and equipping them to share the Gospel.

Comfort said he would love to see every school in the U.S. display the Ten Commandments, but noted he believes too many people are “brainwashed into believing in the fallacy of ‘separation of church and state.'”

As CBN News previously reported, the ACLU is suing after Louisiana Republican Gov. Jeff Landry signed H.B. 71 into law, meaning every classroom from kindergarten to the university level, which receives state funding, would be required to display the commandments “on a poster or framed document that is at least 11 inches by 14 inches.”

The effort, slated to be privately funded, will require a poster-sized display accompanied by a four-paragraph explanation offering context. The text will note that the Ten Commandments “were a prominent part of American public education for almost three centuries.”

These classroom posters are due to be posted by the start of 2025.

The ACLU, its Lousiana branch, the atheist-led Freedom From Religion Foundation, Americans United for Separation of Church and State, and nine Lousiana families joined forces to challenge the law. CBN News will continue to cover the case as it unfolds.

Most recently, Living Waters released the “Trump/Biden Million Dollar Bill,” a free tract leading up to the U.S. election in November. It can be ordered here.

These Horrific Weather Events from Long Ago Tell the True Story,"Is This a Climate Emergency? These Horrific Weather Events from Long Ago Tell the True Story

The phrase ""extreme heat"" is being used over and over in news coverage as if to signal that a climate emergency has arrived.

We're told 2023 is on track to be the hottest year on record, while two-thirds of Americans in a PBS/Marist Poll now say climate change is affecting the weather.

Denver resident Mike Barela said, ""People are starting to realize that there is an effect."" Miami resident Stephen Escudero said, ""This definitely feels like we're in that point of no return that people have talked about for a long time.""

Some have called on President Biden to declare a 'climate emergency' amid searing summer temperatures. And UN Secretary-General António Guterres has called for immediate action on climate change, saying, ""The era of global warming has ended; the era of global boiling has arrived.""

Weather history, however, tells a different story – that the worst weather events, including the hottest years, have all been in the past.



The worst hurricane in history? The Great Hurricane of 1780, which killed over 20,000 people in the Caribbean.



The worst wildfire in U.S. history? The Peshtigo Fire in Wisconsin in 1871 killed at least 1,500 people and burned over a million acres.

The worst flood in world history was in 1931 – the Yangtze River Flood in China, which killed almost 4 million people.

The worst flood in U.S. history was in 1889, in Johnston, Pennsylvania.



The deadliest tornado in recorded U.S. history was in 1925. The Tri-State Tornado, which struck Missouri, Illinois, and Indiana, killing some 700 people.

And the hottest year was not 2023, but 1936. In 1936, 21 states had their all-time temperature records.



Steve Milloy of Junkscience.com said, ""We know in the United States that the 1930s were extremely hot – 1936 is the hottest year on record in the United States and probably throughout the northern Hemisphere.""

Some northern cities saw temperatures between 115 and 120 degrees that year. Many thousands died across the country and the resulting Dust Bowl forced the migration of 3 and half million climate refugees out of the Great Plains and Midwest.

There is no dispute that the Earth has been warming incrementally since an extremely cold period known as Little Ice Age ended in 1850.



But Weatherbell Chief Forecaster Joe Bastardi blames this summer's sweltering temperatures on a huge amount of water vapor created by an immense underwater volcanic eruption in Tonga last year that was 1,000 times more powerful than the nuclear bomb dropped on Hiroshima, and by warming oceans.

Bastardi told us, ""There's been an increase in what we call geothermal spreading since the early 1990s. And what it does is it develops a cumulative buildup of heat in the oceans, which then has to be released through the El Ninos, which then puts all sort of water vapor in the air, which then leads to the warming that you're seeing. It's all water vapor.""



There have also been record-breaking cold temperatures this summer, but that weather news is ignored.

Florida Governor Ron DeSantis reminded reporters Sunday that while Hurricane Idalia was very damaging, it paled in comparison to the Category 5 Labor Day storm of 1935, which had peak winds of 200 miles per hour and killed more than 400 people.

“There were people that got caught up in the storm that their clothes got ripped off their bodies, that the wind was so strong. So I think that the notion that somehow, hurricanes are something new that's just false and, and we've got to stop politicizing the weather and stop politicizing natural disasters,"" DeSantis said at a post-hurricane press conference.

Milloy says, ""It's a very complicated issue that the alarmists just like want to boil down to 'fossil fuel use is destroying the planet.' The whole climate is a lot more complicated.

A U.S. district court has ruled that CEF Bible clubs must be provided equal opportunity as other clubs throughout the island state.

Liberty Counsel filed the case against the Hawaii State Department of Education after the continual rejection of Good News Club over a span of three years.

VICTORY! We received a preliminary injunction on behalf of Child Evangelism Fellowship of Hawaii and its Good News Clubs for after school Bible clubs to be given equal access as similarly situated clubs on public school campuses across Hawaii. See morehttps://t.co/pGXN8hhXK8 — Liberty Counsel (@libertycounsel) June 28, 2024

CBN News reported previously that CEF Hawaii had submitted applications to host Good News Clubs in several schools, including Nu'uanu Elementary, Lincoln Elementary, Waimea Elementary, Kalihi Waena Elementary, Kohala Elementary School, and Pearl City Elementary. All submissions were continually denied by the state's Department of Education (DOE).



While the Hawaii DOE argued that the prohibition of these clubs was based on ""misappropriation of school policies,"" CEF argued that their decision reflected ""blatant religious discrimination.""



In a reply brief filed back in April, the legal organization explained that the department chose ""silence"" over correcting ""unequal and unconstitutional treatment"" by its own officials.



The awarded preliminary injunction serves as a big win for religious freedom within schools in Hawaii.

Liberty Counsel Founder and Chairman Mat Staver said, ""This is a great victory for Child Evangelism Fellowship, parents, and the students in Hawaii public schools. The U.S. Supreme Court has ruled that public schools cannot discriminate against Christian viewpoints regarding use of school facilities. Child Evangelism Fellowship gives children a safe space that offers moral and character development from a Christian viewpoint. Good News Clubs should be in every public elementary school.""

Good News Clubs, which meet weekly, are led by community volunteers. These clubs encourage learning, service, and spiritual growth while also existing to help develop a child's social skills, leadership skills, emotional well-being and character.

CBN,https://www1.cbn.com/cbnnews/world/2024/july/beryl-makes-landfall-as-category-4-hurricane-on-caribbean-island,2024-07-01,18:27:02 UTC,Beryl Makes Landfall as Category 4 Hurricane on Caribbean Island,"SAN JUAN, Puerto Rico (AP) - A dangerous and extremely powerful Hurricane Beryl made landfall Monday on the Caribbean island of Carriacou after becoming the earliest storm of Category 4 strength to form in the Atlantic, fueled by record warm waters.

Winds up to 150 mph (240 kph), just shy of a Category 5 storm, blew off roofs, uprooted trees and caused other damage on Carriacou, one of the islands of Grenada, and elsewhere in the southeast Caribbean.

“This is an extremely dangerous and life-threatening situation,” the National Hurricane Center said.

Hurricane warnings were in effect for Barbados, Grenada, Tobago and St. Vincent and the Grenadines as thousands of people hunkered down in homes and shelters. The last strong hurricane to hit the southeast Caribbean was Hurricane Ivan 20 years ago, which killed dozens of people in Grenada.

NBC Radio in St. Vincent and the Grenadines said it received reports of roofs being torn off churches and schools as communications began collapsing across the southeast Caribbean.

In nearby Grenada, officials received “reports of devastation” from Carriacou and surrounding islands, said Terence Walters, Grenada’s national disaster coordinator. Prime Minister Dickon Mitchell said he would travel to Carriacou as soon as it’s safe, noting that there’s been an “extensive” storm surge.

Grenada officials had to evacuate patients to a lower floor after hospital roof was damaged, he said.

“There is the likelihood of even greater damage,” he told reporters. “We have no choice but to continue to pray.”

Later on Monday morning, Beryl was about 30 miles (50 kilometers) north of the island of Grenada, moving west-northwest at 20 mph (31 kph).

In Barbados, officials received more than a dozen reports of roof damage, fallen trees and downed electric posts across the island, said Kerry Hinds, emergency management director. Wilfred Abrahams, minister of home affairs and information, said drones - which are faster than crews fanning across the island - would assess damage once Beryl passes.

A tropical storm warning was in effect for St. Lucia, Martinique and Trinidad. A tropical storm watch was issued for Haiti’s entire southern coast, and from Punta Palenque in the Dominican Republic west to the border with Haiti. A hurricane watch was issued for Jamaica.

Forecasters warned of a life-threatening storm surge of up to 9 feet (3 meters) in areas where Beryl made landfall, with 3 to 6 inches (7.6 to 15 centimeters) of rain for Barbados and nearby islands and possibly 10 inches in some areas (25 centimeters), especially in Grenada and the Grenadines.

The storm was expected to weaken slightly over the Caribbean Sea on a path that would take it just south of Jamaica and later toward Mexico’s Yucatan Peninsula as a Category 1.

“Beryl is forecast to remain a significant hurricane during its entire trek across the Caribbean region,” the National Hurricane Center said.

Officials in some southeast Caribbean islands announced controlled power outages and warned of water cuts ahead of the storm, as well as landslides and flash floods. Schools, airports and government offices shuttered.

Beryl strengthened from a tropical depression to a major hurricane in just 42 hours - a feat accomplished only six other times in Atlantic hurricane history, and with Sept. 1 as the earliest date, according to hurricane expert Sam Lillo.

It also was the earliest Category 4 Atlantic hurricane on record, besting Hurricane Dennis, which became a Category 4 storm on July 8, 2005.

“This is a dangerous hurricane for the Windward Islands,"" said hurricane specialist and storm surge expert Michael Lowry. Beryl amassed its strength from record warm waters that are hotter now than they would be at the peak of hurricane season in September, he said.

Beryl is the second named storm in the Atlantic hurricane season, which runs from June 1 to Nov. 30. Earlier this month, Tropical Storm Alberto made landfall in northeast Mexico and killed four people.

The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration predicts the 2024 hurricane season is likely to be well above average, with between 17 and 25 named storms. The forecast calls for as many as 13 hurricanes and four major hurricanes.

An average Atlantic hurricane season produces 14 named storms, seven of them hurricanes and three major hurricanes.

While the court did issue some major rulings about immunity, the justices chose not to rule directly in Trump's specific case, kicking it back down to the lower courts. That move will delay special counsel Jack Smith's criminal case against Trump, likely pushing it until after the November election.

In its Trump v. United States ruling, the high court said the lower courts simply hadn't finished the job yet.

Chief Justice John Roberts explained, ""The lower courts rendered their decisions on a highly expedited basis"" and ""did not analyze the conduct alleged in the indictment to decide which of it should be categorized as official and which unofficial,"" according to SCOTUSblog.

Historic Ruling on Presidential Immunity

The Supreme Court did make several statements about immunity that those lower courts will need to apply to Trump’s case.

In a historic ruling, the justices declared that former presidents have absolute immunity from prosecution for their official acts based on core constitutional powers. But they also declared, ""There is no immunity for unofficial acts.""

""It's a very big win for former President Trump. Recognizing for the first time this sort of immunity of ex-presidents from criminal prosecution,"" said Prof. Kate Shaw of the University of Pennsylvania Carey Law School.

Former President Donald Trump has claimed that he acted in his official duties as president when he challenged the certification of the 2020 election on January 6 and should be immune from prosecution.

But Chief Justice John Roberts wrote, ""Trump asserts a far broader immunity than the limited one we have recognized.""

Officers with the Irving Police Department said in the aftermath of the attack that they do not believe the double homicide was a random act of violence. Rather, they said, it was a “targeted” assault. And the suspect, identified as 37-year-old Oved Bernardo Mendoza Argueta, fled the scene before officers arrived, KXAS-TV reported.

Once police arrived on the scene, they pronounced two victims dead inside the restaurant.

Mendoza Argueta reportedly fled the scene in a 1997 Honda four-door sedan. He is married to a Chick-fil-A employee who witnessed the crime and identified her husband to authorities. Mendoza Argueta was captured by police in the early morning hours Thursday and booked in the Irving City Jail.

Listen to the latest episode of “Quick Start”

He has been charged with capital murder.

The alleged perpetrator was swiftly placed on an immigration detainer by the U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement, which means ICE intends to take custody of the assailant.

A spokesperson for ICE told the New York Post that its Enforcement and Removal Operations in Dallas “lodged an immigration detainer with the Irving Police Department” regarding Mendoza Argueta.

“Our hearts are broken by the tragedy that unfolded inside our restaurant Wednesday,” the local Chick-fil-A franchise owner said in a statement. “We will miss our two team members dearly. Right now, our focus is on providing care for our team and the victims’ families.”

News of the killing comes as President Joe Biden and former President Donald Trump sparred in Thursday night’s debate over illegal immigration and trouble at the U.S.-Mexico border,” which the presumptive Republican presidential nominee described as “the most dangerous place anywhere in the world.”

“When he was president, he was … separating babies from their mothers, put him in cages, making sure that the families were separated,” said Biden, according to CBN News. “That’s not the way to go.”

Trump retorted, “We have the largest number of terrorists coming into our country right now. All terrorists all over the world, not just in South America, all over the world. They come from the Middle East, everywhere, all over the world. … And this guy just left it open.”

When we feel stressed out, depressed, or otherwise unhappy, many of us tend to reach for comfort foods like ice cream, macaroni and cheese, or fried chicken, to feel better. Doctors say while these dishes stimulate the pleasure center in our brains giving us instant satisfaction, in the long run, they can actually harm our mental health.

Sugar is the Enemy

Psychiatrist Daniel Amen, author of Change Your Brain Every Day, told CBN News our diet plays a major role in how well our brain functions. The types of foods and drinks we consume directly contribute to the way we think and feel through a complex system of neurotransmitters, hormones, and more.

""Sugar is the enemy of brain health,"" Dr. Amen said. ""Sugar is pro-inflammatory, and inflammation is clearly associated with depression.""

Dr. Amen says good mental health begins with minimizing the consumption of junk foods like sugary, processed foods and drinks that are loaded with chemical additives and lack fiber and other nutrients.

""We reach for things that help us feel better now, but not later,"" he said.

Dr. Amen said a brain-healthy diet consists of 70% fruits and vegetables and 30% good protein, like pasture-raised chicken and healthy fats like salmon and olive oil.

""Brain and mental health, just like spiritual health, is a daily practice,"" he said.

The Gut-Brain Connection

Psychiatrist UmaNaidoo, author of This is Your Brain on Food: An Indispensable Guide to the Surprising Foods that Fight Depression, PTSD, ADHD, Anxiety, OCD, and More, told CBN News the brain and the intestines are linked by the vagus nerve.

""These two organ systems start from the exact same cells in the human embryo. And so they are inextricably connected throughout our lives,"" she said.

Dr. Naidoo says research shows mental health can be improved by increasing the good bacteria in the gut and minimizing the bad bacteria. She said for better or worse, these tiny organisms play a major role in the way we think and feel.

""The way that we eat is not just about our weight or our waistline,"" said Dr. Naidoo, ""it's also about our mental well-being.""

Dr. Naidoo points out that a gut-healthy diet is high in fruits and vegetables, whole grains, and healthy fats and contains very few processed foods and sugar.

Dr. Naidoo says a healthy diet is not usually meant to replace prescription medication for people suffering from mental health disorders but can often offer additional benefits beyond drugs.

""I would never suggest eliminating or removing one form of treatment, because as a psychiatrist I've seen those can be very valuable, in fact, life-saving to some individuals,"" she said. ""So this is really meant to be an additional tool in your toolkit.""

However, she said many patients who were struggling with mental health issues like depression and anxiety but not taking medication saw their conditions improve just with diet alone.

""I see it all the time. I will get calls and emails coming back at me saying, 'I'm feeling calmer, I'm sleeping better,'"" she said. ""People notice the difference.""

Tailor-Made Diets

Dr. Naidoo said while a generally healthy diet can help people with just about every type of mental health problem, there are specific recommendations for certain diagnoses.

For example, Dr. Naidoo said people with ADD, ADHD, or people who experience difficulty focusing should eat a healthy breakfast every day. She said while intermittent fasting can be helpful for some, people with difficulty focusing should avoid fasting in the morning and instead consume a meal rich in polyphenols, such as those found in green tea, coffee, berries, cherries, kale, and chia seeds.

She said people with OCD or anxiety issues should consider avoiding too many glutamates, which are often found in seemingly healthy foods like tomato sauce, fish sauce, and miso. Glutamates are amino acids that act as neurotransmitters that are deeply intertwined with OCD symptoms.

President Biden's tired and confused appearance at the presidential debate has some in the media and the party calling for him to get out of the race.

Both the New York Times and Atlanta Journal-Constitution have called for him to step aside, as have some major party donors.

Democrats are now worried Biden could cost them the Senate and keep them from flipping the House.

Maryland Democrat Congressman Jamie Raskin said there are different opinions about the path forward.

""There are very honest and serious and rigorous conversations happening at every level of our party because it is a political party and we have differences in point of view,"" Raskin said.

Politico reports members of Biden's family are urging him to stay in the race and privately calling for his top advisors to be fired for the president's poor performance, saying he was not properly prepared.

Delaware Democrat Sen. Chris Coons, a Biden ally, brushed off the president's performance, saying Biden still has the support of many in the Democratic Party.

""He had a scratchy, rough voice, and he answered in ways that were not forceful, but side by side, Donald Trump had a horrifying debate performance. Yes, he spoke plainly, but what he said was lie after lie after lie,"" Coons said.

Former House Speaker Nancy Pelosi told CNN Democrats will still retake the House with Biden on the ticket. ""Let us not make a judgment about a presidency on one debate. I don't think it's a problem. It's a bad night,"" Pelosi said.

But a new CBS/YouGov poll shows 72% of voters believe Biden does not have the mental and cognitive health to serve as president.

Even the former White House photographer weighed in, posting on Instagram ""It's time for Joe to go"" and telling Axios, ""The debate was not the first bad day, and it's not gonna be the last.""

Democratic strategists admit there is no way to change the party's nominee unless Biden himself steps aside.

The Biden campaign says that would lead to chaos.

Trump supporters offered their opinions to CBN News at a rally in Virginia on Friday.

Lauren Euhus said, ""I think at this point it's kind of a lost cause.""

Rie Sadler said, ""I think we started to see really how badly Joe's in decline and it's just sad.""

Today, the Trump campaign is expecting a Supreme Court ruling on his claim to presidential immunity, which could shield him from criminal prosecution.","Democrats Divided After Biden Debate FlopPresident Biden's tired and confused appearance at the presidential debate has some in the media and the party calling for him to get out of the race.

JERUSALEM, Israel – After President Joe Biden's shocking debate performance Thursday, Israelis are alarmed, as are many other allies. They worry evil actors on the world stage might take advantage of the world's greatest superpower being led by a frail, weak, commander-in-chief.

If America's Leader is Frail & Weak, Will Israel's Enemies Choose Now to Strike Harder?

As columnist Amnon Lord put it in Israel Hayom, “In a world rife with aggressive forces, the unflattering image of an American president – the leader of the free world – appearing weak and incoherent encourages them to exploit opportunities.”

Israeli columnist Nadav Eyal added in Yediot Ahronot, ""Weakness is not a trait that an American president can convey, by any means.""

Sen. John Barrasso (R-WY) expressed similar worries on Fox News this weekend, saying, ""It's what foreign leaders – our enemies – saw in that debate, in China, Russia, Iran, North Korea. Right now are they thinking, 'This is our moment of opportunity?'""

Biden Administration Accused of Still Withholding 7 Weapons Systems from Israel

Israeli Defense Minister Yoav Gallant told Israel Defense Forces in northern Israel this weekend it's their military might that may intimidate Hezbollah enough that it will halt its daily attacks in the region and negotiate a peace deal.

Gallant declared the nation is readying either for war or for peace, noting Israel is ""preparing the military force, defense, attack, and this can happen quickly. On the other hand, the political alternative is being prepared. It is always preferable. We are not looking for war, but we are ready for it.""

He added, ""The thing that gives us the flexibility to be able to discuss political solutions is that we have military solutions.""

But as Israel may soon face war with Hezbollah and its more than 150,000 missiles, one highly-placed U.S. lawmaker says the Biden administration is still withholding seven weapons systems from the Jewish Nation.

On Fox News Sunday, Rep. Michael McCaul (R-TX), who chairs the powerful House Foreign Affairs Committee revealed, “This is what is most disturbing to me, is that we’re withholding weapon systems that I have signed off on and Congress has appropriated with the intent of sending those weapons to Israel.”

'Hamas Is the Only Obstacle'

Noa Argamani, one of those four Israeli hostages rescued in Gaza recently, is speaking out. She's reminding the nation that so many hostages remain in captivity.

In a video, she implored, ""We can't forget about the hostages who are still in Hamas captivity, and we must do everything possible to bring them back home.""

Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu is pointing out that no hostage deal can currently be worked out because Hamas refuses to deal.

As he put it, “And today everyone knows a simple truth: Hamas is the only obstacle to the release of our hostages.""

Hamas claims the problem is that Israel won't agree to end the war and remove all its troops from Gaza. ""Without this being achieved, all that is presented is just a waste of time,"" said senior Hamas official Osama Hamdan.

Netanyahu, though, contends that there is no way to end the war until Hamas is completely defeated by Israeli forces.

""Every day they (the IDF) eliminate dozens of terrorists,"" Netanyahu stated. ""It is a difficult struggle that is waged above ground, sometimes in face-to-face battles, and it is also waged underground.""

“Anthem of Grace” kicked off with a massive global broadcast on Good Friday, hitting tens of millions of people with the Gospel. Translated into 60 languages, millions more are still consuming the content in nations across the world months after the event was first aired.

“It’s been amazing to see what God is doing,” Hall, founder of the Pulse Movement, told CBN News. “And I think we all know this, but … there’s a revival spreading. There’s joy, there’s hope.”

The evangelist said the Anthem of Grace campaign centers, in part, on “Amazing Grace,” the “most sung and most translated hymn ever.” Beyond that, he said the campaign seeks to focus on the power of the Gospel to change hearts and minds.

“[It also focuses on the] story of every believer whose life has been changed by this and trying to tell the story of God’s grace in our lives, and welcoming people into that anthem of grace,” Hall said.

The faith leader said the mission of highlighting the change God has made in people’s lives and helping others discover the same transformation in their own journeys is the pinnacle of the campaign.

“It’s just incredible to see the hunger, and we’re really just trying to see a global movement of just pointing back to the grace of God,” Hall said. “And, hopefully, equipping as many believers as possible to share that story of how God’s changed them.”

Hall said he is humbled to see how God has used his ministry to reach so many hearts.

Listen to the latest episode of “Quick Start”

“This is amazing. … I’ve got three kids, I’m in a ministry now 20 plus years,” he said. “And I’m just incredibly humbled and incredibly thankful to still be following Jesus. I’m thankful to be more in love with Jesus than I’ve ever been.”

At the end of the year, Hall said he hopes “Anthem of Grace” helps light a fire in the hearts of people who have not yet encountered the Lord.

“In my heart and talking to so many believers … I just believe Jesus is coming soon … I just go to, you know, ‘How do we see as many people as possible hear the Gospel and know the Gospel?'”

Hall continued, “Because we know that … the Word promises things, right? The Word’s going to go to the ends of the Earth and then Christ is going to return.”

The preacher offered a reminder of what the Bible says about the end of days, noting how Jesus proclaims there will be “wars, and rumors and wars” and other happenings. Every generation since Christ has awaited His return, but Hall said world conditions right now make it feel more impending.

“It does seem like there’s a quickening around the world,” he said. “And I think what we’re seeing is that the dark is getting darker and the evil is getting greater. And, with that, the light is seeing brighter.”

Hall wants every person who claims to know Jesus to “testify to the goodness of God” — something he believes would immediately transform global circumstances.

“It would change the world overnight … just the testimony of the saints,” Hall said. “Even in Revelation, it says, ‘We’re going to overcome by the blood of the lamb and the word of their testimony.'”

Thus, he hopes people’s testimonies make a massive difference by proving the Gospel’s power and sway to a watching world.","Evangelist Nick Hall is in the midst of yet another monumental, year-long evangelism campaign — and he believes hearts and souls are being transformed.

Hengaw, an organization reporting on human rights violations against Kurds in Iran, stated there has been no reason given for the charges against the five Christians.

Listen to the latest episode of “Quick Start”

Hamid Afzali was sentenced to 10 years behind bars, followed by Nasrollah Mousavi, Bijan Gholizadeh, and Iman Salehi, each of whom were sentenced to five years, and Zohrab Shahbazi, who received a nine-month jail sentence, The Jerusalem Post reported.

In a statement to CBN News, Todd Nettleton, vice president of message for the Voice of the Martyrs, said, “The growth of the church in Iran is wonderful news for Christians around the world, and a great reminder of God’s ability to grow His church in spite of anything that any government might do to stop it.”

“But the high price our Iranian brothers and sisters are paying to follow Christ is a different kind of reminder: to pray often for them as they willingly suffer for the name of Christ,” he added.

The report from Hengaw noted that, while Christians are “acknowledged as a religious minority in Iran, authorities impose severe penalties, especially on those who convert from Islam to Christianity.”

Iran’s decision to imprison the five Christian converts violates article 18 of the United Nations’ International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, which states, “Everyone shall have the right to freedom of thought, conscience and religion. This right shall include freedom to have or to adopt a religion or belief of his choice, and freedom, either individually or in community with others and in public or private, to manifest his religion or belief in worship, observance, practice, and teaching.”

In addition to these five Christian arrests, Hengaw noted that another recent Christian convert in Iran, Yasin Mousavi, has been sentenced to 15 years in prison for charges including “membership in groups or associations aimed at disrupting security” and “propaganda against the government through promoting Christianity.”

OpenDoors.org, which tracks Christian persecution around the globe, has placed Iran at No. 9 on its World Watch List and rates the persecution Christians face in the Muslim-ruled country as “extreme.”

“For Christians who convert from Islam, not even the veneer of tolerance is present. Conversion from Islam to Christianity is illegal in Iran, and anyone caught as a convert can be arrested and imprisoned,” the organization explained in part. “The government views conversion as an attempt by the West to undermine Islam and the Islamic government of Iran. This means that anyone who is discovered to be a member of a house church can be charged with a crime against national security, which can lead to long prison sentences.”

Now, it's on a mission to build 40 more megachurches in the next 10 years.

Most roads in Hyderabad on Sundays lead to Calvary Temple. Shortly after 4 a.m., side streets around the church here are already jammed.

As church volunteers coordinate traffic, shuttle buses, auto rickshaws, and motorcycles ferry thousands of people, all trying to get here two hours ahead of Calvary's first of five services that begin at 6 a.m.

By sunrise, the faithful have taken their seats.

The main sanctuary holds 18,000 people supported by adjacent Bethlehem Hall with 15,000 and a third structure accommodating more than 3,000 more.

Hundreds more watch on television screens scattered around the sprawling Calvary campus.

Pastor Satish Kumar preaches all five services with the last one ending at 8 p.m.

""I've been given the grace to pastor this church which is beyond my dream and imagination,"" Pastor Kumar told CBN News.

Calvary Temple started in 2005 with about two dozen people. Today, it boasts more than 300,000 members making it one of the largest churches in the world.

They have 11 satellite churches with plans for more nationwide expansion.

""God put a burden in my heart to establish 40 mega churches just like what you see here during the next 10 years,"" said Kumar.

Pastor Kumar says the church adds some 3,000 new believers each month in a sign that the Lord is moving mightily across the country.

""God's hand is upon India, it's a time for India to reach the lost, not only within the country but across the globe,"" Kumar said.

In addition, the church produces over 650 TV programs each month in 17 of the country's major languages for broadcast on national television.

""It's not only within the nation, but also in Bangladesh, Nepal, Sri Lanka, Afghanistan, Pakistan and Gulf countries,"" said Kumar.

Millions more follow on social media. The reason for the church's success?

""Preaching the pure Word of God is what attracts people, and practicing the Word of God is what keeps people within the church,"" said Kumar.

That practical demonstration is on full display here each Sunday.

Narayana Podhili works as a civil engineer during the week. On Sunday, he leads an army of 150 church volunteers who spend hours chopping, slicing, peeling, and stirring – all to prepare free breakfast, lunch, and dinner meals for 50,000 people.

""We are committed to come here every Sunday at 3:30 a.m., 4 a.m., and we keep working till evening,"" Podhili told CBN News as he marshaled his forces.

Nagavalli Mendem has served in the Calvary kitchen for seven years after making a promise to God that if He healed her cancerous tumor, she would serve the church in this capacity.

""Because I made that promise, God healed me completely without surgery,"" Mendem said. ""God cleared the tumor in my chest and healed me. As a thanksgiving to Him, I serve here at the Lord's house.""

She and volunteers feed more than 200,000 people each month.

""In India, we say, 'service to mankind is service to God' so that is what we try to practice,"" Kumar said. ""We try to show God's love in action in every possible way that we find.""

Calvary also has an on-campus hospital where members get free medical treatment on Sundays and medicines at reduced cost.

""The majority of the people who come here are poor and cannot afford treatment,"" said Dr. Vinod Kumar of Calvary Hospital.

Members also have access to church facilities to hold marriages. And when a church member passes away, Calvary handles all funeral, burial, and meal arrangements – again, all for free.

In 2007, Calvary Temple created an access card system, the first of its kind, to follow up with members and their families.

""I have thousands of people. How do I know who hasn't shown up on a Sunday? As I was praying God put access card into my mind,"" Kumar said.

Each member must swipe their card when attending any one of the five Sunday services.

""Without fail, if we don't show up to church, we get a call,"" said Chandraiah, a Calvary Temple member. ""They'll ask me why I didn't come to church and after they find out they will pray for me. I'm happy when I receive that call. Not only that, but the fact also that they care for us is special, and because of that we will surely come to the next service.""

Pastor Kumar says prayer has always been an integral part of their success. The church has held 40 days of prayer and fasting regularly since 2005 drawing tens of thousands of young participants to stadiums around the country.

""During this 40 days of fasting and prayer, I teach from Genesis to Revelation,"" Kumar told CBN News. ""Every book I try to explain. Hundreds of thousands of young kids end up reading the whole Bible.""

Each month, the church, along with its satellite campuses, holds a ""Night with God"" as members pray for revival.

""About 25,000 to 30,000 people join. That has been the biggest, largest all-night prayer services in our nation,"" Kumar said.

In recent years, however, India has witnessed an unprecedented uptick in violence against Christians.

""The more the persecution, the more the church grows and that's what's happening in India,"" Kumar said.

Most attacks are carried out by Hindu extremist groups who accuse Christians of forcibly converting people to Christianity.

Pastor Kumar, a Hindu convert to Christianity himself, says resistance produces power.

""No persecution has ever succeeded in stopping the preaching of the Word of God, it always promoted the Word of God and spread the Word of God across the countries,"" said Kumar. ""It's my passion, my burden that before I die, I want to see every Indian will hear the gospel and know the Savior.""

Oklahoma's top education official ordered public schools to incorporate the Bible into lessons for grades five through 12 this week.

State school superintendent Ryan Walters says his mandate is compulsory and “immediate and strict compliance is expected.”

He points out that since the Bible's influence on America and Western civilization has been foundational, students need to be educated about its role in U.S. and world history.

""The Bible is an indispensable historical and cultural touchstone,"" Walters said. ""Without basic knowledge of it, Oklahoma students are unable to properly contextualize the foundation of our nation which is why Oklahoma educational standards provide for its instruction.""

Walters has previously noted that America is in a culture war and he doesn't want “woke ideology” spread by the state's public schools.

Left-wing groups have predictably threatened legal action calling the state school superintendent's move a violation of the U.S. Constitution. “Public schools are not Sunday schools,” said Rachel Laser, president and CEO of Americans United for Separation of Church and State.

Oklahoma law explicitly allows Bibles in the classroom and lets teachers use them in instruction.

But earlier this week the Oklahoma Supreme Court blocked the state's attempt to launch the first publicly funded religious charter school in the U.S.

He went on to condemn the modern political left as “aggressively anti-common sense” during an interview with English journalist Tina Brown at the Aspen Ideas Festival in Colorado.

“Part of it the left has to own,” he told Brown. “They are aggressively anti-common sense. The Democrats keep running on this one idea, saying to the American people, ‘You can’t possibly think you can do worse than Donald Trump.’ And they keep saying, ‘Yes, we can. Yes, we can.'”

Maher went on to explain he has Democratic friends who have leftist children, many of whom, the comedian suggested, accuse their parents of “old thinking” and not understanding their progressive points of view.

“Tear down statues of Lincoln? Maybe give communism another shot? Get rid of the border patrol? Get rid of capitalism? White supremacy has never been worse? Gender is always just a social construct? It’s OK to have penises in the women’s swimming pool, in women’s prisons?” he said, listing a handful of the views held by leftists. “No, it’s not that I’m old; it’s that your ideas are stupid.”

Listen to the latest episode of “Quick Start”:

Maher explained to Brown that, if Democrats insist on embracing far-leftist ideals and refuse to collaborate in any way with Republicans who oppose Trump, they are only aiding the GOP in defeating incumbent President Joe Biden.

“That’s as good as it gets,” he said. “If you can’t talk to those people, you’re just abandoning the country to half the people who are even worse, who are going to vote for Trump this next time — and they are — and he very likely will win, and then what are we going to do?”

“I think we should keep the dialogue open,” the HBO’s “Real Time” host added.

Maher recently appeared on the ABC talk show “The View,” where he condemned those on the left who have chosen to vehemently oppose Israel and protest in support of Hamas.

“If I had any doubt that I was right about the change that’s happened in the left, watching people protest for a terrorist organization like Hamas — that straightened me out pretty quick,” he said, later adding, “It’s astounding to me that they can’t tell the good guys from the bad guys, just morally. If you’re for Hamas, just live in Gaza for a day … [even] before the war.”

Ultimately, he said the best way to stop Israel from retaliating is to “stop attacking Israel.”

In what's widely known as the Chevron case, the court took a step to curb the ability of the ballooning federal bureaucracy to bypass Congress with backdoor regulations.

In the other case, the high court issued a ruling about obstruction that could have a big impact on the future of President Trump and Capitol riot defendants.

The Chevron Case & the 'Deep State'



In a far-reaching decision, the Supreme Court upended the 40-year-old Chevron precedent that made it easier for federal government agencies to create their own rules on issues like the environment, public health, and business regulations.

The original Chevron decision allowed federal agencies to unilaterally fill in the details whenever government officials claimed the laws passed by Congress were too ambiguous.

Critics have argued for decades that only Congress has been given the power to legislate, so allowing bureaucrats broad power to invent thousands of regulations violates the U.S. Constitution. It's one of the reasons those critics have referred to the massive size of the federal government as the ""nanny state"" or even the ""deep state"" because unelected bureaucrats often seized that opportunity to operate autonomously from the legislative or judicial branches.

THE CHEVRON CASE David v Goliath: Small Businesses Fight Federal Bureaucracy at US Supreme Court

BREAKING: In a major blow to the unelected administrative state, the Supreme Court has overruled the Chevron doctrine, which required courts to defer to the legal interpretations of unelected bureaucrats.



“Chevron is overruled.” pic.twitter.com/tqC5EYaUBl — Sean Davis (@seanmdav) June 28, 2024

Chief Justice John Roberts wrote the court's opinion stating, ""Perhaps most fundamentally, Chevron's presumption is misguided because agencies have no special competence in resolving statutory ambiguities. Courts do.""

Tyler O'Neil, managing editor of the Daily Signal, wrote on X, ""This is a huge step forward for holding the administrative state—and the deep state—accountable.""

The Capitol Riot and Obstruction

In the other major case, the Supreme Court made it harder to charge Capitol riot defendants with obstruction, a charge that also has been brought against former President Donald Trump.

In a 6-3 ruling, the court ruled that charging someone with obstructing an official proceeding must include proof that defendants tried to tamper with or destroy documents. Only some of the people who breached the Capitol on Jan. 6, 2021, fall into that category, so many of those cases are expected to be affected by reduced sentencing.

Liberty Counsel Founder and Chairman Mat Staver said, ""This new narrow interpretation will make it difficult for these indictments to stand.""

Chief Justice John Roberts wrote Friday's decision, joined by Justices Samuel Alito, Neil Gorsuch, Brett Kavanaugh, and Clarence Thomas, and by Biden nominee Justice Ketanji Brown Jackson.

It's unclear how the court's decision might affect the obstruction case by Special Counsel Jack Smith against Trump in Washington. But the high court is expected to release a separate decision Monday regarding presidential immunity, and that ruling will directly impact Smith's case.

But the amount of firepower being assembled on Israel's northern border suggests that war could start any day now.

By the tens of thousands, Israeli troops continue gathering and preparing on that border with Lebanon. Their purpose is to stop Hezbollah terrorists who've been attacking northern Israel from Lebanon almost daily for months.

That's forced some 80,000 Israelis to flee their homes and empty out whole communities near the border. As Kiryat Shmona resident Yarden Haziza puts it, ""Living right now in Kiryat Shmona is very sad. The city is empty most of the time.""

Hezbollah hit the north with some 40 rockets on just Thursday alone. The terrorists say it was to avenge a number of recent Israeli air strikes on Hezbollah infrastructure and personnel.

'On the March to Conquer the Middle East'

As the war against Hamas grinds on in Gaza and tensions mount in the north, Israel's prime minister keeps trying to get the world to focus on the threat from Iran, the massive power behind both Hezbollah and Hamas. Benjamin Netanyahu insists Iran's jihadists have an evil goal.

He's warning Iran and its proxies are, as he put it, ""On the march to conquer the Middle East.""

Visiting the north this week, Israel's president complained the international community is doing little to stave off war. So Isaac Herzog said it shouldn't be surprised if, as he said, ""The situation spirals out of control.""

Exuberant Defiance of Terrorism

Even as Israel braces for what could be another massive and painful war, the Tribe of Nova came together in Tel Aviv Thursday in exuberant defiance of terrorism. They held their first mass concert since Hamas attacked their festival near Gaza on October 7th.

Nimrod Arnin's sister was among the more than 360 festival-goers killed there.

He told the concert crowd, “On that Saturday at the beginning of October, our light was put to the test - a test which in our worst nightmares we didn’t imagine we would have to pass. The ultimate darkness challenged the big light of the Tribe of Nova.""

The Thursday concert featured dozens of dancers on stage re-enacting the horror of that morning. And the crowd of tens of thousands all stood quiet in a long moment of silence commemorating all who were lost.

'We Will Dance Again!'

But the main message of the day wasn't at all somber. It was that Israelis will not let the terrorists steal away their lust for life, or their joy, or their dance.

As concert attendee Maxim Mileyev put it, ""Nothing can stop us from living our lives here in Israel. And nothing can stop us from keeping on dancing and living.”

Nimrod Arnin summed up what so many in the Tribe of Nova have come to know. He told the concert crowd, ""In a moment of enlightenment we realized what is going to be the essence of our life from now and on. We will dance again!""

The crowd cheered him...and danced for hours. They wanted to show that while Hamas worships death, Israelis embrace life...and life to the fullest.

Some are even calling for Biden to be replaced as the nominee.



Voters were also concerned by what they saw from the president as he struggled and stumbled throughout the evening.



Within the opening minutes, he flubbed a line saying, ""What I've been able to do with the Covid, excuse me, with, dealing with everything we have to do with, look, if we finally beat Medicare.""

Cognitive Concerns



It became clear to the former President's surrogates, that Biden was in trouble.

Rep. Elise Stefanik (R-NY) said, ""The Biden campaign said this would be the reset moment for Joe Biden's candidacy and what they saw, what the American people saw, was a weak, horrible president, who is the weakest president in our nation's history.""



Voter concerns about Biden's age and mental sharpness were on display during the 90-minute debate as the president struggled at times to answer questions.



Sen. Marco Rubio (R-FL) said, ""He repeated things that were not true and he also said things that, to be frank, there were times that I could not understand what he was saying.""



The showdown had Biden and Trump, the two oldest candidates to ever seek the White House, trading barbs on a number of topics.



On the Economy



""The only jobs he created are for illegal immigrants and bounce back jobs that bounce back from the Covid. He has not done a good job, he's done a poor job, and inflation is killing our country,"" Trump said.



On Abortion



""We are not for late-term abortion. Period. Period, period,"" Biden said.

Trump replied, ""Under Roe v Wade, you have late-term abortion. You can do whatever you want. Depending on the state, you can do whatever you want. We don't think that's a good thing. We think it's a radical thing. We think the Democrats are the radicals.""



On Immigration



Biden said, ""When he was president, he was taking separating babies from their mothers, put him in cages, making sure that the families were separated. That's not the way to go.""



Trump pushed back accusing Biden of putting in place weak border policies that make America unsafe.

""We have the largest number of terrorists coming into our country right now. All terrorists all over the world, not just in South America, all over the world. They come from the Middle East, everywhere, all over the world. That pouring in. And this guy just left it open.""

Biden's Poor Performance



The two also tackled wars in Ukraine and Gaza.



But by the end of the night, everyone was talking about President Biden's poor performance.

Michigan resident Rosanne Ponkowski said, ""I have dealt with people that have dementia before, and it's very obvious just from the look on his face, not understanding what's going on, the surprised and shocked look sometimes, the eyes, the very stiff face, the very stiff hands, they're all very prominent signs of what's going on.""

The White House tried to put a brave face on the evening telling reporters that Biden had a cold.



Surrogates like California Governor Gavin Newsom (D) attempted to side-step voter concerns that the president is too old.



CBN News directly asked Gov. Newsom, ""There's a lot of concern about the president's stamina and mental health. Are you concerned, 81 years old, are concerned about that going forward?"" Newsom replied, ""I'm worried about President Trump's stamina."" We followed up with, ""No, I'm talking about the president."" Newsom replied, ""No, I'm talking about President Trump as well.""



One top Biden donor reportedly called the president's performance disqualifying, telling Reuters that he expects Democrats will urge him to step aside ahead of the party's national convention in August.

Still, in a post-debate rally, Biden told supporters that he was confident he could win against Trump. ""Look, we're going to beat this guy. We need to beat this guy. And I need you in order to beat him. You're the people I've run for,"" Biden said.



Coming into the debate, Biden and Trump found themselves nearly tied in some national opinion polls. We'll see in the coming days whether this debate did anything to significantly change those dynamics. For now, though, the race is set to be decided here in Georgia and a handful of other key swing states like Wisconsin, Michigan, and Arizona. Meanwhile, voters there and across the country will get another look at the candidates on September 10th.","ATLANTA – Democrats are panicking over President Biden's shaky performance in last night's historic debate with former President Trump.

The hijab — the headscarf traditionally worn by many Middle East women — is becoming harder to spot in Iran these days.

For many Iranian women, the hijab has become a symbol of oppression. They're refusing to wear it, even under the threat of beatings and imprisonment.

Change is coming to the autocratic, saber-rattling Islamic Republic of Iran that Americans see on the news. And it's coming fast.

It's clearly visible on the streets of the capital Tehran in the wake of the mass protests that began in September 2022, following the death in police custody of Mahsa Amini, a 22-year-old woman who resisted wearing her hijab.

The raw emotion of the protests — including images of women publicly burning their hijabs — has evolved into a controlled expression of resoluteness and strength.

Explosive Yearning

The protests, known as the ""Women, Life, Freedom Movement"", burst the cork out of the bottle. The demonstrations, resulting in thousands of arrests and more than 500 deaths over several months, were an explosion of yearning for women's rights.

And the Iranian regime got the message loud and clear.

The protests cleared the fog and smoke between the demands of the people and the demands of the state. A clear line has been drawn. Both know what each other's demands are. The government has resumed its ""morality police"" project to force women to wear the hijab. But Iranian women are not backing off.

This movement continues to gather momentum.

Increasingly, Iranian men are showing broad support for women's rights and freedoms. They're recognizing core human rights that benefit the whole of society. This would have been unimaginable just a few years ago.

The change is not only social. It's religious, too.

Christians in Iran have long been subjected to persecution and even torture and death. Today, Iran has the third highest number of religious prisoners, with 347 citizens behind bars for their faith — and those are just ones we know about.

But most Iranians don't see Christians as ""the enemy"" anymore.

A generation ago, the idea of being an Iranian and a Christian was unthinkable, unforgivable even. Now it's accepted without a blink.

Yet the hardline regime still denies citizens the freedom to attend church or convert to Christianity. Officially, there isn't a single Farsi-speaking church in the entire nation of 90 million people.

Illegal house churches — believers secretly meeting in homes — are raided routinely by the police, their leaders interrogated and imprisoned.

A New Revolution

But new media platforms, including Zoom, Instagram, and WhatsApp, are revolutionizing church for Iran's ""isolated"" believers.

They're worshiping online in real-time with other isolated believers outside Iran in places such as Türkiye, building a sense of Christian unity in a region that's 97% non-Christian. Respected Iranian Bible teachers living in exile overseas teach and preach via Zoom and on-air via live broadcasts, encouraging and strengthening the underground church.

There's more to this new media revolution.

SAT-7, the multimedia ministry with which I serve in the Middle East, launched the first-ever Christian video-on-demand streaming service in the region, which is totally free to watch.

Social media, especially Instagram, allows us to connect directly with Iranians watching live programs on satellite television or on their phones and digital devices. Viewers, young and old, pepper us with questions about Jesus and Christianity.

A boy named Kaamran told us: ""The kids at school know I'm a Christian. They ask questions and I don't know how to answer. I pray for them. I really want the Lord's throne to be set up here in Iran.""

Change is coming to Iran. It's coming fast.

In fact, it's already here.

(AP Photo/Alex Brandon)

In one of the most eagerly anticipated opinions of this term, the U.S. Supreme Court has essentially decided to kick the can down the road on Idaho's abortion law.

The official release of the ruling comes a day after the decision was prematurely leaked by someone at the Supreme Court. It was published online briefly on Wednesday before being removed. A court spokeswoman said the post was a mistake.

The decision will allow emergency abortions for now in a procedural ruling that leaves key questions unanswered. For now, the Idaho case will continue to play out in lower courts, and could end up before the Supreme Court again.

Liberty Counsel Founder and Chairman Mat Staver explained, ""This order means that the case returns to the Ninth Circuit, which had ordered that the appeal of the preliminary injunction be decided by the full court on an expedited basis without any further briefing. The abortion ban currently remains in place in Idaho, except for those in emergency room situations.""

WATCH Our Analysis: Supreme Court Rules on Idaho Abortion Ban

What the Case Is Really About

The Biden administration had sued Idaho claiming the state's law violates a federal law called the Emergency Medical Treatment and Labor Act (EMTALA). The White House insists the EMTALA requires hospital emergency rooms to provide abortions to women if their general health is at risk. Idaho's law already provided an exception to save the life of the mother, so the case is seen as an effort to expand abortion access beyond that.

Idaho Solicitor General Joshua Turner suggested the Biden administration's ""health"" definition is too broad because it could be interpreted to include many non-life-threatening health concerns, including mental health.

And the Alliance Defending Freedom accused the Biden administration of trying to invent ""a federal abortion mandate by manipulating EMTALA.""

During the arguments at the court, Justice Samuel Alito said the EMTALA was not intended to include abortion because it specifically identifies unborn children as patients who should be cared for in emergency rooms.

""One potentially very important phrase in EMTALA,"" he said, ""is the reference to the woman's unborn child. Isn't that an odd phrase to put in a statute that imposes a mandate to perform abortions? Have you ever seen an abortion statute that uses the phrase, 'unborn child?'""

Alito pointed out, ""So in that situation, the hospital must stabilize the threat to the unborn child. And it seems like the plain meaning is that the hospital must try to eliminate any immediate threat to the child. Performing an abortion is antithetical to that duty.""

Abortion Leaks at the Supreme Court

Two years ago, Politico obtained a draft of the Dobbs ruling that overturned Roe v. Wade, stoking widespread outrage by pro-choice activists before the ruling was officially meant to be revealed. It fueled extremists who began firebombing and vandalizing pro-life pregnancy clinics and issuing death threats to the workers who try to help women facing unexpected pregnancies.

The Supreme Court never discovered who infamously leaked that Dobbs ruling, and now there is speculation about why this Idaho abortion ruling was also leaked.



Pro-life activist Kristan Hawkins posted on X, ""With media reporting on what appears to be a disappointing outcome in the EMTALA case, you have to wonder whether it's time for some people working on our nation's highest court need to be invited to find new jobs. Did the person who leaked the Dobbs decision 'accidentally' post today? Inquiring minds want to know.""","An pro-life protestor is seen on the ground after being pushed during a protest by abortion activists at the Supreme Court, June 24, 2024.

During the great North Korea starvation in 1998, Mrs. Son served in the military, as caretaker of supplies and later as a broadcaster of the Juche, North Korea's propaganda outlet.



She told CBN News, ""My father was the provincial governor and bribed the military officer with a pig so I could get in because it was a way we can get food rations and not starve like the rest of the country. But things got bad when my father lost the elections. He became very sick and died. My brother was detained and died of starvation in prison.""



In order to survive, Mrs. Son and her mother escaped to China.



""We swam across the Tuman River for two days and bribed the North Korean soldiers and brokers in China. There we found a Christian church who helped us,"" Mrs. Son said.



After a few months, Chinese police began to trail them. Mrs. Son shared her harrowing experience.

""My mom noticed the police. She told me to jump out of the van when it stopped. I took off my clothes and shoes and gave to my mom because it was winter time and she needed to be warm. With only my underwear on, I jumped out of the van and 8 Chinese police chased me. I was already a Christian but not deep. But I knew it was God who protected me and instructed me to hide and hold onto the under bars of a truck. I got away but my mom was taken back to North Korea. I went back to try to find her only to find out that she suffered and died in prison because she did not deny her Christian faith.""



Mrs. Son eventually returned to China where she married a Chinese Christian. Several months later, she was re-captured though this time her husband gave her money to help her escape.



""Right before I was transferred to North Korea, I put all the money, the paper bills in plastic bags and swallowed them so that the soldiers will not see them. A week later, I got them all out. I used this to bribe the soldiers and brokers to go back to China.""



After yet another arrest, Mrs. Son spent 400 days in a North Korean prison under inhumane conditions where once again, she experienced God's help.



""The guard was my friend and he gave me rice. But it was the worse because I had to eat insects to survive. After 400 days, I was released… malnourished and could barely walk. This was when my husband used his Chinese citizenship to get me to South Korea,"" Mrs. Son recounted.



Once in South Korea, Mrs. Son joined the Seopyoung Church where she grew in her Christian faith. She realized how God saved her miraculously each time she was arrested.

Rev. Chun Myeong Guen, head pastor of Seopyoung Church, said, ""It is impossible for North and South Korea to reunite politically because of different cultures and backgrounds. Therefore, reunification can only happen through faith because there will be no misunderstanding of each other. Only faith can make us reunite overnight.""

""During the starvation, many North Korean defectors escaped to China. Many believed Jesus, received Christian education in other countries and became missionaries in North Korea where there are now about 600,000 Christians in underground churches,"" he reports. ""Many Christians in South Korea who are praying for reunification believe it will happen in 5 years. It is like a ticking bomb.""



North Korean Christians like Mrs. Son can help make this happen.



""I want to thank my Mom and be like her. She gave her life for her Christian faith. I am also dedicating my life to serve Jesus Christ and spread the gospel and worship Him until I die,"" Mrs. Son said.","""We swam across the Tuman River for two days and bribed the North Korean soldiers and brokers in China.

Those are the words of Lex Renick, a female who formerly identified as a transgender male before she and her husband — who used to identify as homosexual — came to faith in Jesus.

Nic and Lex Renick got married on May 30, 2020, when both of them were living out their LGBT lifestyles. They have since turned away from their past decisions, with Lex restoring her female identity and returning to the name she was given at birth and Nic abandoning his homosexual identity.

Listen to the latest episode of “Quick Start”

The pair married one another as husband and husband but, since their respective salvation experiences, now identify as a heterosexual couple — husband and wife. They recently spoke with The Daily Wire’s Michael Knowles about their salvation experiences in a lengthy interview.

Knowles, a Catholic, described the couple’s testimony as “one of the wildest stories I’ve ever heard.”

In addition to restoring their live spiritually, Lex and Nic told Knowles they are seeing physical restoration. The two now share a healthy baby and, early on in their relationship, Lex underwent biopsies and was told she had cancerous cells in her body. But a doctor from Planned Parenthood recently told her, “This doesn’t make physical possible sense, but you no longer have any cancerous cells in your body.”

“I think it just goes to show that anyone can transform or turn into anything that they want,” said Nic of their experience together. “But nobody talks about transforming back to the original design that you’re supposed to be.”

He continued, “The world can tell you so much about who you’re ‘supposed to be’ based off of your interests or your personality type, and try to fit you into all of these crazy, outlandish boxes that might … make you feel included for a time.”

For her part, Lex opened up about the fact she believed the “lie” of the LGBT community.

“The whole world in the queer community was saying, ‘Well, you know if God made you then God made you this way,'” she recalled hearing. “[But] that argument doesn’t work with the trans community. Because, if we say, ‘God made me this way,’ then that means that I should have been a woman.”

Lex went on to explain to Knowles she found solace in the LGBT community because she was desperate for identity and belonging — something she had not previously found in her family or faith.

She grew up in an abusive household — one that claimed to be “Christian” — with a mother who struggled with alcoholism and even once told Lex, “If I would have known that you were going to be my child, I would have aborted you,” a comment her mother made after learning Lex struggled with her sexuality and gender identity.

Every time she tried to find comfort and safety in her family or in a church, Lex said they would “reject me.” Ultimately, she found the belonging she desired in the LGBT movement.

“I ran to this loving community, and that was the queer community, because they accepted me for me, not that I needed edifying or acceptance from the church,” she recalled. “I just needed a loving body of believers or family to wrap their arms around me and say, ‘Hey, we’re going to walk with you through this journey.’ But all I faced was rejection.”

Nic, on the other hand, began identifying as homosexual as a teenager but never faced the kind of isolation and rejection Lex experienced. His family, he said, “never tried to change me,” even though they took issue with his sexual identity, believing it contradicted God’s design for males and females.

“They didn’t condone or agree with what I was doing, and that is the exact Christian model of how I feel we should address the community,” he said. “We can’t shun or reject nor condone at the same time.”

Initially, as a transgender male — meaning biologically female — and a homosexual male, the couple wanted to have children, even when Lex was identifying as a man. But since their transformation, they have abandoned their former identities and now are true to their biological realities: a female and a male.

They currently share one child and just announced they are pregnant with their second baby.

The couple said they eventually found a church in Las Vegas where, even though its leaders didn’t condone their LGBT lifestyles, they welcomed them in as they were. It was there that they experienced true spiritual transformation.

“They chose to love us,” Lex said of the church they attended. “And that ministered to our hearts so much because we got to hang out with more believers and allow God to do the work on our hearts and then have friends in our lives to encourage us in the leading of the Lord rather than separating and kind of gatekeeping Jesus by taking people out of the church.”

In March, Lex and Nic renewed their wedding vows for the first time as husband and wife.

“I’m so in AWE of the Goodness of God,” Lex wrote in an Instagram post. “He is so so good! So many tears hearing my husband say, ‘I do,’ after Pastor Ivan said, ‘Do you take her to be your bride.’ Words, I never thought would be so sweet to hear deep within my soul. What an honor it is to be Nic’s bride. What an honor it is to serve God together and build His Kingdom.”

Now there's been a major revelation about how the Biden administration has pushed the transgender agenda when it comes to children.

According to the New York Times, Biden officials played a significant role in convincing an international pro-transgender medical group to remove age limits from its guidelines for trans surgeries.

""Email excerpts from members of the World Professional Association for Transgender Health (WPATH) recount how staff for Adm. Rachel Levine, assistant secretary for health at the Department of Health and Human Services and herself a transgender woman, urged them to drop the proposed limits from the group's guidelines and apparently succeeded,"" The Times reports.

The administration was reportedly concerned that age minimums would trigger political backlash that could fuel legislation opposing the trans ideology.

More than two dozen states now have laws restricting gender-altering medical experiments on the bodies of minors. And this week, the Supreme Court agreed to hear the Biden administration's challenge to one of those laws.

LATEST Supreme Court Takes up Hot Topic of Gender-Altering Procedures on Children

Critics say children are too young to make these irreversible, life-altering decisions while supporters claim that young people with gender dysphoria need the procedures right away.

But as CBN News reported earlier this year, U.S.-based think tank Environmental Progress reported that even the WPATH admitted behind closed doors that ""children and adolescents cannot comprehend the lifelong consequences of 'gender-affirming care,' and in some cases, due to poor health literacy, neither can their parents.""

MORE Leaked Files Reveal Major Risks with Transgender Experiments: 'It Is Not Medicine'

When we confronted WPATH about those claims, Marci Bowers, M.D., president of the group, told us in a statement, ""The world is not flat. Gender, like genitalia, is represented by diversity. The small percentage of the population that is trans or gender diverse deserves healthcare and will never be a threat to the global gender binary.""

Meanwhile, England and other European nations are backing away from transition procedures on minors after studies showed ""weak evidence"" that they lead to long-term positive impacts.

""This is one instance in which I think Europe is headed in the right direction,"" Sarah Parshall Perry of the Heritage Foundation told CBN's Wendy Griffith. ""In addition to that, we are now seeing Norway, Finland, Sweden, and now the most recent edition is Scotland who has backed off the use of chemical castration agents as well.""

There is also a growing number of people who regret undergoing gender transition and are seeking to revert back to their biological gender. They're warning distressed children and their families about rushing into life-altering medical decisions.

This debate is also the earliest in modern history, well ahead of the traditional fall schedule.

New rules aim to prevent chaotic scenes from past debates. There will be no live audience, no opening statements, and both candidates' microphones will be muted unless it's their turn to speak.

Performance on the debate stage might be the most crucial aspect for the 81-year-old Biden as Republicans highlight his age and mental health.

""Which Joe Biden's going to show up?"" asked House Speaker Mike Johnson. ""My summary is this: It doesn't matter if he drinks a whole gallon of energy drinks, he's not going to be able to match the acumen and the readiness of Donald Trump.""

Nathan Gonzales from Inside Elections tells CBN News that because some Republicans have portrayed Biden as too old and incompetent, the real challenge may lie with Donald Trump. ""Trump is used to feeding off the crowd and energy in the room, and that's just not going to be there,"" Gonzales explained. ""Trump is going to have to be disciplined when it comes to time and whether the mic is on or off. He must avoid being perceived as a bully.""

Biden is expected to focus on Trump's 34 felony convictions—a first for a presidential candidate—and other pending criminal cases. He will also likely address the abortion issue after the Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade, thanks to three Trump appointees. Trump, on the other hand, is expected to highlight issues such as the flood of unchecked migrants on the U.S. southern border and high inflation.

President Biden has been preparing for the debate at Camp David over the past several days. Former President Trump has been on the campaign trail, and Wednesday night, he attended a prayer conference call with members of a faith advisory board.

That news comes as top Israeli leaders visited the border with Lebanon where war could break out any day.

Aides to the prime minister have reportedly told the White House that when Netanyahu addresses a joint session of Congress in July, he'll present a new take on achieving a pathway to a Palestinian state. That would be a huge shift.

Yet those reports may be wrong. The Prime Minister's Office told The Times of Israel that Netanyahu ""opposes a Palestinian state and will not change his position in his address to Congress.""

The prime minister has consistently opposed Palestinian statehood in recent years, as poll after poll shows a huge majority of West Bank Palestinians themselves don't want a state next to Israel. They just want Israel destroyed.

Itamar Marcus, director of Palestinian Media Watch, points out most Palestinians hail the murderous attacks on Israelis, including what happened on October 7th.

""There's tremendous support within the West Bank for what happened on October 7th,"" Marcus stated. ""There was a poll taken a month and a half after October 7th – and everyone knew what happened, everybody knew about the rape and the destruction and the massacres – and Palestinians were asked 'With everything that's happened up till now, does it make you proud as a Palestinian?' And 98 percent of Palestinians said it made them proud.""

Preparing for War with Hezbollah & US Weapons Delays

On another front, both Netanyahu and Israeli President Isaac Herzog toured Israel's northern border with Lebanon this week. That's where all-out war may soon come, as the Jewish nation seeks to end daily attacks from Hezbollah on Israeli communities along the border.

In Washington, Israel's Defense Minister Yoav Gallant has supposedly made progress in speeding up shipments of weapons to the U.S. from Israel.

Netanyahu has accused the Biden administration of deliberately slow-walking such shipments.

For the first time, the U.S. administration is admitting there have been bottlenecks in getting some of those weapons shipped.

Gallant addressed Americans, saying Israel needs the U.S. by its side. ""The powerful and enduring bond between the United States and Israel is key to our nation's strategy and our security,"" the defense minister said.

Pennsylvania Sen. John Fetterman has been one Democrat particularly strong in supporting Israel's war with Hamas as others have wavered. He's met with Netanyahu on his first visit here. ""We stand with Israel through this and I'm so sorry for what's been done to this nation,"" Fetterman declared.

Turkey's President Recep Tayyip Erdogan pledged that his nation will stand with Hezbollah if it comes to war. He's condemning Western nations for backing Netanyahu, whose mental fitness he questioned. Erdogan asserted, ""It is extremely bad and pathetic that governments that talk about freedom, human rights, and justice are captives of a mentally ill person like Netanyahu.""

Antisemitism in NYC

In New York City, a masked man who demanded Jews get off a subway car earlier this month faces criminal charges of attempted coercion. He had yelled, ""Raise your hands if you're a Zionist – this is your chance to get out!""

Earlier this week, several dozen people protested against Manhattan District Attorney Alvin Bragg for his refusal to prosecute most of the anti-Israel demonstrators who illegally occupied Columbia University's Hamilton Hall this spring.

One protester said of Bragg, ""He's either a coward or an antisemite.""

Fortune,https://fortune.com/europe/2024/07/02/uk-most-wfh-friendly-country-europe-culture-war-france-lags-behind/,2024-07-02,05:00:00 UTC,"A WFH ‘culture war’ has broken out across Europe, with the U.K. leading the charge as the most WFH-friendly country, while France lags behind","Sometime between March 2020 and the end of 2021, ‘office workers’ ceased to be a thing.

Offices didn’t, of course, and nor did the kind of work that people typically did in offices before the pandemic. But the inherent connection between the two was irrevocably severed, as working from home became first a necessity, and then forever afterwards a possibility.

Now, WFH has become a point of contention across the world, as workers clash with management over where people work and who gets to choose. As Professor Mark Mortensen at business school INSEAD tells Fortune, “There is a culture war happening right now.”

Like most wars, the struggle over remote and hybrid working has multiple fronts. So where in Europe is WFH winning?

What does the data say?

The U.K. leads Europe in the home-working league table, according to the Global Survey of Working Arrangements (G-SWA), an authoritative annual study by leading economists into the behaviors and preferences of over 40,000 workers in 34 countries.

In fact, the average British employee with a graduate education spends twice as much time working remotely as their French—and three times more than their Greek—counterparts. Countries that have actively targeted remote working foreign ‘digital nomads’, like Portugal and Italy, meanwhile, have middling levels.

Days working per week, selected European countries:

U.K.: 1.8 (the same as the U.S.)

Germany 1.5

Netherlands/Italy/Spain/Sweden 1.2 (the same as the European average)

Portugal 1.0

France 0.9

Denmark 0.8

Greece 0.6

G-SWA’s latest data was from the spring of 2023, but the pattern seems to be holding.

According to LinkedIn data prepared for Fortune, 41% of U.K. job postings on its platform were for hybrid roles in April 2024, compared with 32% for the wider Europe, the Middle East and Africa region.

Britain also had the highest proportion of remote-only roles in Europe, at 9%—three times higher than in France and Netherlands, which was the pre-pandemic leader in remote working.

Perhaps the most compelling indicator is transport usage figures. Analysis by the U.K. Department for Transport found that between May and June 2024, London Underground usage only hit between 75% and 87% of 2019 levels, with Mondays and Fridays consistently far below pre-pandemic averages.

For comparison, according to the Global Cities Survey 2024, Paris Rail had returned to 91% of pre-pandemic usership by the second quarter of 2023.

Why?

Various factors affect remote and hybrid working rates, including wifi connectivity, divergent lockdown experiences and the sector mix in different countries. Put simply, manufacturing and retail don’t lend themselves to WFH, while coding and publishing do.

The U.K. economy is more skewed towards services than most of its European neighbors, particularly to finance and tech, so structurally you’d expect to see more hybrid and remote working there.

But there’s another, arguably more important factor, says INSEAD’s Mortensen: a national culture of individualism.

“The more individualistic a country is, the more people like and push for remote and hybrid working,” he says, pointing to high levels of individualism in countries like the U.K. and the Netherlands, and much lower levels in Asian countries like Japan, China and South Korea, where working from home levels are also far lower.

“That’s another reason that the U.S. tends to be very big on it,” Mortensen adds.

In fact, analysis by the international economists behind the G-SWA suggests that two-thirds of the variance between countries can be explained by their level of collectivism versus individualism.

It certainly seems to play out in what people in different countries say about how willing they are to go along with return to office orders. Recruiter Randstad’s 2024 Work Monitor, which surveyed 35,000 workers globally, found that Brits were significantly more attached to at-home working than their peers on the continent.

When asked whether they would quit if their employer tried to force them to work from the office more, 55% of U.K. respondents said yes, compared with only 23-26% for French, German, Italian and Dutch respondents, 29% of Spaniards and 30% of Swedes.

Does it matter?

Demand for flexible working arrangements remains widespread, with employees in countries that have low WFH levels, like Greece and Turkey, expressing a desire to work at home comparable to their peers in the U.K.

In the Netherlands, meanwhile, remote job applications account for a share of total applications five times higher than the share of job listings that are remote.

There are no signs of this preference changing, at least yet. “Our data shows professionals are not willing to give up the flexibility and work-life balance that comes with remote and hybrid roles, with competition for these jobs at a high,” says LinkedIn Career Expert Charlotte Davies.

If employee preference for flexible working persists, you might expect to see more concessions from companies competing for top talent, particularly where WFH is currently less entrenched.

This is particularly the case if legislation or trade union policy entrenches the right to work at home.

Microsoft and Meta are finding about the “degradation of social relationships” from people not working together face to face. Getty Images

Mortensen, though, isn’t convinced. “It drives me crazy when people using [pandemic era] data and saying, well it worked during COVID, which was a giant existential dread and people didn’t have any other option….the company not falling apart in two years doesn’t mean that remote working is the best way you can organize.”

He points to what companies like Microsoft and Meta are finding about the “degradation of social relationships” from people not working together face to face, the lack of “enculturation” of new starters, and the decline in creativity and collaboration that has accompanied higher levels of home working.

“We know that things that are beneficial for organizations are often beneficial for individuals. People feel engaged and motivated by doing something new and innovative, so maybe [being in the office] is not just good for the company, it’s good for me too,” Mortensen says.

In other words, if too much time at home hurts performance—and for that matter career progression and job security—it will cease to look all that appealing to employees.

Ultimately, we’re still dealing with relatively new arrangements that have unknown long-term impacts. The situation is still evolving, as is our understanding of how to manage it as employers, and how we feel about it as employees—and that applies wherever you live.","As Professor Mark Mortensen at business school INSEAD tells Fortune, “There is a culture war happening right now.”Like most wars, the struggle over remote and hybrid working has multiple fronts.

Culp could remain at GE’s helm through 2028 if he and the board agree, the company said in a securities filing on Monday. The extension comes after Culp orchestrated a multiyear turnaround of the former conglomerate, culminating with the April spinoff of its energy-related businesses. That left GE Aerospace, the world’s largest maker of jet engines, as the remaining company. It separated its health-care division in 2023.

Culp’s existing contract at GE was set to expire in August. He had been cited by analysts and others as a candidate to succeed Boeing’s Dave Calhoun, who has said he plans to step down by the end of the year. For his part, Culp has downplayed that possibility, saying he intended to remain at GE Aerospace.

GE shares gained 56% this year through Monday’s close, well ahead of the S&P 500 Index’s 15% increase.","General Electric Co. agreed to extend Chief Executive Officer Larry Culp’s leadership of the aerospace manufacturer through at least 2027, removing him from the field of potential candidates to be Boeing Co.’s next CEO.

Fortune,https://fortune.com/2024/07/01/gamestop-stock-investor-lawsuit-dropped-keith-gill-roaring-kitty-pump-and-dump/,2024-07-01,22:52:55 UTC,GameStop investor drops pump-and-dump lawsuit against ‘Roaring Kitty’ just 3 days after filing it,"A lawsuit accusing popular stocks influencer Keith Gill, better known as “Roaring Kitty,” of engaging in a “pump and dump” scheme involving GameStop Corp. shares was dropped within days of its filing.

In a proposed class action filed Friday in Brooklyn, New York, federal court, GameStop shareholder Martin Radev sued Gill for securities fraud, claiming he was seeking to manipulate the stock for his own gain. In a court filing late Monday afternoon, Radev said he was voluntarily dismissing the lawsuit.

It’s unclear why Radev dropped the suit, and his lawyers didn’t immediately respond to requests for comment. The dismissal was without prejudice, meaning he is free to file the suit again.

Gill also didn’t respond to an email seeking comment.

One of the public faces of the 2021 meme-stock craze, Gill amassed more than a million followers across his “Roaring Kitty” YouTube channel and “DeepF***ingValue” Reddit page. He reemerged in May and again began posting about Gamestop on X, the social media platform formerly known as Twitter.

The suit alleged that Gill acquired 120,000 call options in GameStop before he began posting about the company in May. The stock, which had been trading around $17 just before Gill began to post, soared to $48.75 on May 14.

On June 2, he revealed that he owned 5 million shares of GameStop and 120,000 call options that were set to expire on June 21. By June 13, Gill’s holdings had risen to more than 9 million shares of GameStop with no outstanding call options.

Gill “quietly sold and/or exercised (i.e., dumped) all 120,000 of his GameStop call options for a large profit, seemingly to increase his own stake in GameStop stock by over 4 million shares,” Radev said in the suit.

GameStop shares have since fallen, though they’re still higher than they were before Gill’s posts. They closed at around $23 on Monday afternoon.

GameStop’s recent rise was less pronounced than during the meme-stock frenzy. The company surged more than 1,700% during one stretch in January 2021, and the stock’s stratospheric rise appeared to pit scrappy individual investors against sophisticated hedge funds that were heavily shorting the troubled mall retailer.

On Monday, Chewy Inc. shares spiked as much as 10% after Gill disclosed a 6.6% passive stake in the online pet food and product retailer.

The filing with the US Securities and Exchange Commission came days after the investor posted a photo with a puppy without any comment on X. The post briefly sent the pet food retailer to a one-year high on Thursday.

Fortune,https://fortune.com/2024/07/01/australia-vape-vaping-prescription-pharmacy-law/,2024-07-01,21:47:55 UTC,Australians now need a prescription to buy a vape under new ‘world-leading’ law,"While the U.S. languishes on e-cigarette reforms, Australia on Monday introduced some of the world’s most restrictive vaping laws as part of a global effort to combat what the World Health Organization calls an “alarming” rise in youth vaping.

Effective immediately, the reforms prohibit the supply, manufacture, import, or sale of a vape device outside a pharmacy in Australia. The ban applies to all vape devices regardless of whether they contain nicotine.

Under the new regulations, Australians must also have a prescription from their general practitioner to purchase a device. At the pharmacy, they will have a limited choice of three flavors: menthol, tobacco, and mint, and will need to engage in a discussion with the pharmacist before making a purchase.

The concentration of nicotine in these vapes will be controlled, and their packaging will be “pharmaceutical-like,” according to the bill. The law aims to address the “scourge” of recreational vaping, Mark Butler, the health minister, said in a statement.

“It is a public health menace, particularly for children and for young people,” Butler said. About 22% of 18- to 24-year-old Australians reported using e-cigarettes or vaping devices at least once, governmental data last year showed. Yet at least 61% of these vapers in a similar age group have expressed the desire to quit, according to the Associated Press.

The laws “will return vapes and e-cigarettes” to their intended purpose: a therapeutic remedy for smoking cessation, the health department said in a statement after the law passed.

Why Australia’s approach is unique

Many countries have moved recently to regulate their e-cigarette markets. As many as 121 countries or territories regulate electronic nicotine delivery systems, according to a 2023 WHO report. Of those nations, 33 have banned the sale or importation of vapes entirely, though e-cigarette black markets thrive in some of these countries, including India and Turkey.

Australia’s prescription-based model is unique, but many of the nation’s other reforms have been replicated by its affluent peers. Australia banned disposable vapes starting Jan. 1, and the United Kingdom followed quickly, then went a step further, banning the sale of tobacco to anyone born in 2009 and after to create a “smoke-free generation.”

In the U.S., regulations have moved much more slowly. The FDA has authorized only 27 tobacco– and menthol-flavored e-cigarette products and devices, largely from popular brands including NJOY and Vuse. Notably, other brands such as Juul, Lost Mary, and Elf Bar don’t make the list, and these vapes continue to be sold illegally. Chinese e-cigarette manufacturers also flout vape restrictions, making millions importing flavored disposable vapes into the American market.

Last month, American politicians tore into top public health officials for not enforcing their own laws during a contentious hearing on youth vaping.

“You’re failing!” Senate Judiciary Committee Chair Dick Durbin (D-Ill.) said during a heated exchange with Deputy Assistant Attorney General Arun Rao, representing the Justice Department. These officials, during the meeting, pledged to act quicker on enforcement.

Loopholes and problems in the law

While Australia may be touting a “world-leading” reform for vaping restrictions, its new law comes with loopholes already in place. Under a last-minute amendment, restrictions will soon ease up slightly. Starting in October, adults over the age of 18 will no longer need a prescription, but will be required to have a “conversation” with their pharmacist before purchasing a vape over the counter. Children under the age of 18 will still need a prescription to purchase a vape.

Additionally, vapes purchased in Australia can have a nicotine concentration of no higher than 20 mg/ml, which is the limit many other nations have. In the U.S., vapes with more than twice that nicotine content dominate the market, according to Truth Initiative, an anti-smoking nonprofit.

A previous version of Australia’s law already required a prescription to buy vapes, which could be more widely sold—but retailers were able to skirt the law by pretending their vapes don’t contain nicotine. Young people have found it easy to obtain these vapes.

But now that it’s illegal to sell vapes outside pharmacies, the law effectively transfers the burden of managing the nation’s e-cigarette supply from tobacco shops and retailers to pharmacists.

The Pharmacy Guild of Australia, which represents the nation’s pharmacy owners, opposed the bill, arguing that they did not want to sell “highly addictive” vapes without a prescription.

“The Senate’s expectation that community pharmacies become vape retailers and vape garbage collectors is insulting,” the guild said in a statement.

It is now up to each individual pharmacy to decide whether to sell vape products. Pharmacists will have to verify the age of the buyer, provide them with advice on smoking cessation, and ensure that they have not purchased more than one month’s supply. It is not yet clear what that supply refers to, or how it is quantified.

While illegal vape sellers could spend up to seven years in jail for violating the new provisions, the law does not criminalize possessing personal-use quantities of vapes, including illicit ones. A person can have up to nine vapes on them at a time, according to the Guardian. There will be a 12-month amnesty period, in which people with more than nine vapes can surrender or dispose of their surplus vapes.

Michael Bonning, a spokesperson for the Australian Medical Association, the nation’s top doctors’ group, said the new law would create a “seismic shift in how accessible vapes are.”

“These are world-leading reforms that doctors and all health professionals have pushed for,” Bonning told the Australian Broadcasting Corp.

However, it is unclear yet how enforcement of the retail ban will work. As of Monday, several convenience stores and tobacconists continued to easily sell their flavored nicotine products, the Guardian reported.

“No ban. We keep selling,” a cashier at a convenience store in a Melbourne suburb told the Guardian.","Effective immediately, the reforms prohibit the supply, manufacture, import, or sale of a vape device outside a pharmacy in Australia.

Fortune,https://fortune.com/2024/07/01/butter-prices-record-high-dairy-producers-cheese-bird-flu-cows-milk-output/,2024-07-01,21:45:52 UTC,Butter prices jump to all-time high as bird flu keeps U.S. milk output tight,"Butter has never been this expensive as a limited world supply has buyers scrambling before the holiday baking season later this year.

Prices hit an average of $7,350 per metric ton on the latest Global Dairy Trade auction, surpassing a previous peak of $7,086 in 2022. The auction, which holds its next sale Tuesday, helps set the direction for dairy prices, including the Chicago futures market.

Record butter prices come as world dairy processors have been devoting more milk to making cheese, demand for which has been soaring for foods like pizza. Butter, meanwhile, has enjoyed a demand tailwind since consumers started stockpiling more at home following the Covid-19 pandemic. Butter buyers now are making sure they have enough to meet demand for the baking surge for year-end holiday meals and desserts.

“US manufacturers haven’t invested in butter capacity in many years,” said Mike Lynch, who trades physical supplies for Burt Lewis International in Chicago. “All of the capital dollars are going toward cheese while butter has been the star of the dairy category for a few years now.”

In the US, milk is relatively tight as output has been under pressure from the highly virulent bird flu virus that recently made the jump to dairy cows.

The price of butter is hitting food and confectionery makers already facing high costs for cocoa after prices for beans hit a record earlier this year. And even as overall inflation in food has moderated, goods such as orange juice and robusta coffee have skyrocketed this year.

The record butter price “highlights desperation from global buyers that are running into a tight fat environment throughout the Northern Hemisphere summer and are willing to pay a premium for nearby delivery,” said Alyssa Badger, vice president of global operations and insights at brokerage Highground Dairy.

Relief may be coming soon, at least temporarily. For the past two years, butter prices have slumped at Global Dairy Trade’s auctions in early July.","Prices hit an average of $7,350 per metric ton on the latest Global Dairy Trade auction, surpassing a previous peak of $7,086 in 2022.

Fortune,https://fortune.com/2024/07/01/brooke-shields-actors-equity-plan-agenda/,2024-07-01,21:37:03 UTC,Brooke Shields has found a job she ‘doesn’t resent’—the model and screen actor is fighting for stage actors’ well-being,"“I have spent my entire life in the spotlight,” Brooke Shields said in a campaign video to be the President of Actors’ Equity Association, a union for those working in live performances. And rather than shirk fame, Shields is leaning into the limelight and lending her image to a cause she truly cares about.

The 1990s supermodel-turned-TV-icon has found herself in a new leading role—having won the election in late May and now representing the union which is comprised of more than 51,000 actors and stage managers. At the helm for the next four years, Shields has her work cut out for her. But Shields insists she isn’t afraid of a challenge.

“How do I use Brooke Shields — that thing that is separate from me, that’s a job, and is a commodity of some sort — to make a difference for a community that’s given nothing but love and acceptance to me when it was not cool to cast somebody who had zero Broadway training,” she pondered in a interview with the New York Times’ Michael Paulson, adding that the theater community has always been welcoming and had her back.

Her public persona is something Shields “struggled with my entire life,” said the actor who took her first role at 11 months. “So how do I turn it into something I don’t resent?”

The Hollywood strikes are done, but not the fight

While Shields is an industry name, she’s more known for her work on the screen than her stage performances. That being said, Shields has gone on Broadway as a replacement for roles like Morticia Addams in “The Addams Family” and Sally Bowles in “Cabaret.” As Paulson notes, Shields defeated two other contenders for union president who had more significant union experience.

Shields says the first union meeting she ran was like a scene out of Monty Python—she was unaware of the lingo or even the procedure, like Robert’s Rules of Order. There’s “a huge learning curve,” Shields says, but “I’m ready.”

Famously, Shields is not the only ‘90s icon lending her name to the union cause. Last summer, Fran Drescher, known for “The Nanny,” traded her cheetah print blazers for SAG-AFTRA union tees.

“I am shocked by the way the people that we have been in business with are treating us,” Drescher said at a famous press conference a year ago. “They plead poverty, that they’re losing money left and right, when giving hundreds of millions of dollars to their CEOs. It is disgusting.”

In 2023, the screen actors’ and writers’ unions negotiated new contracts. Workers fought for a number of things, including better conditions, fair wages amidst a new streaming economy with paltry residuals, and greater checks on artificial intelligence usage.

Coming out of the Hollywood strikes tentatively victorious, the unions still have to bat off future fights with studios as AI advances with minimum mitigation. Hollywood workers aren’t alone: names mostly in the music industry have since come out to call for intervention, stating that AI poses risk to their artistic integrity.

And some big names have started to come to the front lines, as by nature of their name and net worth they have less to lose as their industry goes through, at best, growing pains or, at worst, a complete evisceration. Famed producer Tyler Perry recently voiced his fears of AI making jobs obsolete to the Hollywood Reporter, adding that he’s putting his studio expansion on pause after seeing OpenAI’s Sora.

“I absolutely think that it has to be an all hands on [deck], whole industry approach,” Tyler Perry said to the outlet of the need for everyone to get involved. “It can’t be one union fighting every contract every two or three years. I think that it has to be everybody, all involved in how do we protect the future of our industry because it is changing rapidly, right before our eyes.”

What Shields’ theater kids need: fair wages

It seems as if not everyone can afford to be on the front of the picket lines in this economy, by nature of the industry’s infamous paltry wages. The previous president of the Actors’ Equity Association, Kate Shindle, announced she wouldn’t seek re-election because she spent so much time on the unpaid work of managing the members’ crises, she had too few working hours to qualify for the union’s health insurance.

While the fight against unchecked AI has been mostly waged in Hollywood for now, Broadway, too, is taking note. Some stars like Idina Menzel, Bette Midler, and Kristin Chenoweth have spoken out against the usage of AI platforms in the industry, according to Broadway World. And the fight for fair wages continues for creatives off the screen. Negotiations stalled for the union as Equity Negotiating Team Chair Stephen Bogardus said in a statement that “the wage package put across the table by The Broadway League was just plain unacceptable,” adding that the proposed rate for the next five years meant members would be unable to afford to work.

As such, the union has gone on strike against developmental work—meaning projects in development will go on hold while negotiations are worked out. “People aren’t being compensated fairly,” Shields says of the strike.

Shindle noted that her successor would have to tackle paltry wages or deal with a looming strike. “There’s a battle on many fronts,” she told the Times, adding, “ it is a moral imperative for people who decide that they want to produce theater to build their structures around living wages for the artists that work for them.”

And years after COVID-19 first hit, Broadway is still struggling to get a strong audience back. “It’s not fully recovered, obviously, from the pandemic,” Shields adds, noting though that there have been some refreshing new shows.

“I don’t like to fight; I like to discuss,” she says to the Times, though it’s not time yet for her to hang up boxing gloves as the battle for artists is still just beginning.","And rather than shirk fame, Shields is leaning into the limelight and lending her image to a cause she truly cares about.

Fortune,https://fortune.com/2024/07/01/american-express-tock-acquisition-restaurant-reservations-resy-cardholder-perks-gen-z/,2024-07-01,21:28:34 UTC,The secret to securing an elusive reservation at some of the most in-demand restaurants may just be applying for an American Express card,"Known for being the card of choice for business types, American Express is delving deeper into the competitive reservation space with a $400 million deal that could benefit its cardholders.

The company, which bought reservation app Resy in 2019, struck an all-cash deal to acquire Tock, another reservation app, previously owned by Squarespace. The latest acquisition will give Amex influence over a portfolio of 7,000 restaurants and other bookable entertainment experiences listed on Tock.

The company already gives cardholders special table access not available to the general public through Resy. Some of its highest-paying customers, including those with American Express Platinum and Delta SkyMiles Reserve cards, are eligible for the company’s Global Dining Access program that can get them exclusive reservations at the best times, preferential notifications when tables open up, and access to special dining experiences from notable chefs.

With the new acquisition, American Express wants to offer more choices to its cardholders, who spent $100 billion at restaurants in 2023, according to the company.

“Now, we can connect even more premium customers with the most exciting restaurants, while providing merchants and restaurants more technology to help their businesses thrive,” American Express president of U.S. consumer services, Howard Grosfield, said in a statement announcing the acquisition.

In recent years, Amex has moved beyond its stuffy reputation as the credit card of the business elite by reaching out to younger generations like millennials and Gen Z. The effort has largely been a success, with these younger customers making up about 75% of new cardholders for Amex’s Platinum and Gold cards last year, Grosfield told Fortune last month. Compared with their older counterparts, younger cardholders are more actively engaging with Amex perks like travel, dining, and special events.

“Until about 10 to 15 years ago, we thought that no-fee cards were the entry point to bring in younger customers to the franchise,” he said at the time. “We’ve learned that that’s not the right strategy for millennials and Gen Zs. They like the brand affiliation. They like to travel and eat out, and they like the special access and experiences that come with our premium cards.”

American Express did not immediately respond to Fortune’s request for comment on the Tock deal.

Created in 2014 by restaurateur Nick Kokonas, Tock helps restaurants cut down on no-show diners by “selling” reservations for a small deposit. Tock’s technology is also used by other non-restaurant businesses such as wineries, breweries, and museums, that could expand Amex’s network.

Amex’s reservation moves come as it has grown increasingly difficult to reserve tables at some of the best restaurants in big cities. Some of this difficulty is thanks to online booking as well as a flourishing alternative market for reservations secured through bots and fake phone numbers.

One of the people helping sell reservations to the highest bidder is Jonas Frey, who created the platform Appointment Trader in 2021 to let people sell their existing reservations on a virtual marketplace. Over the past 12 months, more than $6 million in reservations have been sold through the site, and Appointment Trader takes a 20% to 30% cut each time, Frey told the New York Times.

Another notable seat slinger is Brown University undergrad Alex Eisler, who said he made $70,000 from his reservation side hustle last year.","Known for being the card of choice for business types, American Express is delving deeper into the competitive reservation space with a $400 million deal that could benefit its cardholders.

Fortune,https://fortune.com/2024/07/01/roaring-kitty-keith-gill-lawsuit-favorite-stocks/,2024-07-01,20:13:14 UTC,Roaring Kitty faces securities fraud lawsuit as his favorite stocks tank,"Meme stock king Keith Gill—also known as Roaring Kitty—seems to be losing his golden touch. Shares of the viral stock picker’s newest target, the online pet retailer Chewy, fell more than 6.5% on Monday even after Securities and Exchange Commission filings revealed his $245 million stake over the weekend. Chewy stock soared last Thursday after Gill simply posted a photo of a cartoon dog on social media, but they’re now 6.6% below Wednesday’s closing price. It was a similar story for Gill’s favorite stock, GameStop, which saw its shares plunge 5.4% on Monday.

This comes as the meme stock king faces a lawsuit in the Eastern District of New York accusing him of committing securities fraud for a string of social media posts about GameStop.

Gill has made a name for himself by leading an army of retail traders into the unloved stocks of struggling companies in an effort to turn a quick profit. The goal of these meme stock traders, as they’ve become known, is to lift the share prices of floundering stocks enough to spark a short squeeze against the (mostly) professional traders that have big bets out against them. Rising share prices force short-sellers—those who’ve borrowed shares in order to bet against a company—to cover their positions by buying stock, thus forcing prices ever higher.

The short-squeeze tactic has proved incredibly effective over the past few years, at least in brief bursts, but the rallying cry behind the meme stock trend is slowly waning.

Gill was able to marshall thousands of retail traders to follow him into stocks like GameStop during the pandemic based on the idea that they were profiting off the misery of Wall Street short-sellers. Many meme stock traders made a central villain out of Citadel founder and CEO Ken Griffin when surging prices of key meme stocks led some brokerages to pause trading because of extreme volatility in 2021. Citadel, a market maker, was even hit with a lawsuit at the time alleging that it colluded with brokerages to pause trading, but a U.S. district judge threw it out shortly after, citing lack of evidence.

Now, with the retail vs. Wall Street narrative fading, Gill’s ability to drive big moves in struggling stocks may be heading down a similar path. Of course meme stocks’ underperformance this year likely has multiple causes: The additional pressure of higher interest rates, the ailing financials of GameStop and other meme stock favorites, and the cooling of the U.S. economy and thus consumers’ willingness to invest in risky stocks could all be to blame.

The slowing of the meme stock trend could also be merely a temporary setback. The good news for Gill’s loyal fans is the latest lawsuit against the meme stock king is likely dead on arrival, at least according to Eric Rosen, a defense attorney and former federal prosecutor who works at the law firm Dynamis.

The plaintiff in the case, Martin Radev, alleges that Gill operated a “pump and dump” scheme that caused him material losses in May. This is when a fraudster attempts to artificially inflate a stock’s price for a short-term gain knowing that the information they’ve shared to do so is false.

But Rosen explained in a June 28 article that this complaint is likely “doomed” for several key reasons. For one, the plaintiff would need to prove that he purchased GameStop’s stock based on false statements made by Gill. That’s difficult when the post the lawsuit is mainly based on is a meme of a man leaning forward to look at a TV.

“The tweets can hardly be described as false. Rather, posting a meme of a guy thinking about GME is not even a fact that can be proven or disproven,” Rosen argued.

Pomerantz LLP, the law firm representing Martin Radev, did not respond to Fortune’s request for comment. Gill did not immediately respond to an X message seeking comment.

Another important issue the plaintiff will need to overcome is the “reasonable investor” standard. In order to prove that the plaintiff was injured by Gill’s social media posts that boosted GameStop’s share prices (prior to a big drop), the prosecution will need to provide evidence that a reasonable investor would see Gill’s picture of a man leaning forward as investment advice. But Rosen argued that a social media post is clearly “not material to reasonable investors.”



“It is clear that the plaintiff here sought to profit simply because Gill tweeted, not because of the content of the tweets,” he wrote. “The tweets of a meme stock icon were not something that a ‘reasonable investor’—one who reads earnings reports and analyzes company news—would take into account when making a decision.”

The plaintiff will also need to prove that Gill both failed to disclose his intent to sell, and was required to disclose his intentions.

“They need to show that Roaring Kitty had a duty to disclose his intent to sell. And this is a high barrier. Generally, only financial advisors or fiduciaries have to disclose their positions or intent or things of that ilk,” Rosen noted.","Meme stock king Keith Gill—also known as Roaring Kitty—seems to be losing his golden touch.

The team’s ownership group, Boston Basketball Partners LLC, has decided to sell the franchise for estate and family planning considerations, according to a Celtics statement. The owners expect to sell a majority interest this year or early 2025, with the remainder closing in 2028.

The Celtics are going on sale at a time of surging valuations for pro sports teams. That’s prompted more franchises to sell minority stakes or offer up control. In the past year, the NBA alone has seen three franchises change hands, with the Phoenix Suns, Charlotte Hornets and Dallas Mavericks all going for $3 billion or more.

Boston won its 18th title last month — the most in league history — and had the best record (64-18) in the regular season. The franchise boasts young stars in Jayson Tatum and Jaylen Brown.

Sportico values the Celtics at $5.1 billion, the fourth-highest in the league. The current ownership group, led by Wyc Grousbeck and including Stephen Pagliuca, bought the team for $360 million in 2002.

The sale comes at a time where the league is in the midst of negotiating a $76 billion media dealwith ESPN, Comcast and Amazon. The deal has not yet been announced. NBA Commissioner Adam Silver has said when the league finishes negotiating its media deal it will look to expand, likely adding two new franchises.

ESPN reported the news earlier.","The reigning NBA champion Boston Celtics are going on the market.

As millions flock to Paris for the eagerly awaited 2024 Summer Olympic Games, France is set to serve 15,000 athletes over the eight-week event, offering everything from sandwiches to buffets and gourmet dining experiences.

Sodexo Live, partner of the Paris Olympic Games, has meticulously planned 500 recipes over the last two years focusing on developing menus, creating recipes, and sourcing the best high-quality ingredients from across France. This includes 3 million bananas, 20 tons of coffee, and for the first time ever, over 47,000 reusable plates.

At the heart of this culinary operation is the Athletes’ Village, which will transform into a 1,200-table, around-the-clock eatery—literally becoming the world’s largest restaurant. Here, Olympians will have the chance to indulge in French delicacies alongside a variety of international cuisines, with an unprecedented 30% of the meals being plant-based, according to Sodexo Live.



“Plant-based food is not only great tasting and flavorful, it’s also great for the environment, and we are helping to reduce the carbon footprint by twofold,” Sodexo Live’s chef Jeff Leidy told Fortune.

With a focus on reducing the carbon footprint and a commitment to sustainability, Paris 2024 hopes to halve the environmental impact through four key actions: reducing animal proteins, limiting food waste, reducing the use of single-use plastic, and prioritizing local and seasonal products. The Games’ food vision emphasizes that adding more plant-based ingredients is the most effective way to significantly reduce the carbon footprint of catering.

Sodexo Live’s goal? “To make this the greenest Olympics ever,” according to Leidy.

Leidy will serve as one of 25 head chefs in the village, leading a team of 1,000 culinary professionals set to serve approximately 40,000 meals a day.

He gave Fortune an exclusive preview of four delectable dishes—three of which are plant-based—that will be served in the village, each tailored to help athletes fuel up and recover from the Games.

Cauliflower Alfredo

Henry Sanchez



When it comes time to pasta, the possibilities are endless. But the “caulifredo” is 100% plant-based, made with cashew cream to achieve that smooth and creamy texture traditionally found in alfredo sauce.

“I personally love this dish just for the flavor. You don’t miss that it doesn’t have real cream or butter,” Leidy says, noting that the tricolor cauliflower, oven-roasted tomato chili threads, and bucatini pasta are enveloped in a velvety cashew cream sauce, enriched with shallots, garlic, and vegan Parmesan cheese.

“This dish has great carbohydrate,” Leidy says. “It’s something that adds a lot of calories for the athlete and it’s a great way to prepare for their event.”

Roast vegetable, summer squash, and farro bowl

Henry Sanchez



“The farro in this dish is an ancient grain. It’s easy to cook, and it has a great nutty flavor.”

Made with cremini mushroom, micro squash, roasted chickpeas and vegetables, toasted walnuts, pomegranate seeds, and cooked farro, the bowl offers athletes an energizing meal to fuel their competitions.

“I love how clean this dish eats, especially for an athlete as they’re preparing for their event.”

The carbs in this dish are important to help athletes boost energy. But Leidy’s favorite part of this bowl is the pomegranate seeds, which “adds a fresh element to the meal.”

Seared scallop, parsnip puree, and roasted beets

Henry Sanchez

For a plant-based twist on this dish, Leidy offers swapping out scallops for trumpet mushrooms.

“Scallops are high in protein, very lean, and high in omega-3 fatty acids,” Leidy says.

The dish features seared scallops or mushrooms, asparagus tips, parsnip puree, and roast beets. Leidy sears the scallops or mushrooms for three to five minutes, allowing them to achieve the perfect caramelization, while cooking the asparagus tips on the side. His finishing touches include citrus beurre blanc, chive, and lemon zest.

Summer citrus salad

Henry Sanchez



While this menu item isn’t completely plant-based, the team decided to serve a citrus salad dish “given that it’s summer, it’s refreshing, and it’s great for a post-event recovery.”

This vibrant dish includes ruby grapefruit, blood orange, and a medley of basil, accented with sumac, roasted pistachios, pearl mozzarella, and watermelon, all dressed in a zesty citrus vinaigrette. Rich in vitamin C and antioxidants, it offers athletes a rejuvenating boost, while the addition of pearl mozzarella and pistachios ensures a protein-packed punch to fuel their endeavors.

Business Daily,https://www.businessdailyafrica.com/bd/markets/commodities/mystery-of-russian-fertiliser-cargo-that-didn-t-reach-kenya-4676192,2024-07-02,03:00:00 UTC,Mystery of 564 tonnes of Russian fertiliser cargo that didn’t reach Kenya,"A consignment of 564 tonnes of fertiliser donated to Kenya by Russia last year disappeared in the high seas, new details show, pointing to a possible theft of the agricultural input.

The missing consignment was part of the 34,400 tonnes of raw fertiliser material Kenya received from Russia during its charm offensive to win the backing of African countries in its deadly battle against Ukraine.

The raw fertiliser material was expected to be used in tripling the production of ready-to-use product for distribution to farmers across the country, notes Auditor-General Nancy Gathungu in her latest report.

The public auditor says the missing consignment did not arrive at the port of Mombasa, suggesting it left Russia, but never arrived in Kenya.

“NCPB (National Cereals and Produce Board) received 33,835.9 metric tonnes hence a short landing of 564.1 metric tonnes from the 34,400 metric tonnes of fertiliser raw materials donated from Russia. The cause of the short landing was not explained,” notes Ms Gathungu in an audit on NCPB.

The 564 tonnes of the missing raw fertiliser would have produced 1,643 tonnes of ready-to-use fertiliser, valued at Sh197 million at the market price of Sh6,000 for a 50kg bag.

The Russian Embassy in Kenya in August last year noted that the 34,400 tonnes that Moscow donated to Nairobi would produce 100,200 tonnes of the finished product after reformulation.

“More than 34,000 tonnes of fertiliser donated to Kenya by the Russian Uralchem-Uralkali Group are now being reformulated to produce 100,200 tonnes of fertiliser. This will help Kenya a lot to get a good harvest this year,” the Embassy stated on August 3, following the landing of the input in the country.

Upon reformulation, the fertiliser (34,400 tonnes) would have a Sh12 billion market value. Russia’s donation came amid increasing prices of the input globally.

The price of fertiliser soared in the wake of Moscow’s full-scale invasion of Ukraine in February 2022, as sanctions imposed on Russia limited availability of natural gas, a main input for nitrogen fertilisers such as ammonia and urea.

This hit farmers financially while some, especially in Africa, stopped using fertiliser altogether, hampering yields and deepening a food crisis.

Since then fertiliser prices have eased as natural gas prices have come down, but Europe’s fertiliser industry is still struggling as Russian imports take a bigger share of the market.

The price of a tonne of fertiliser shot to peak at Sh87,510 in 2022 when the Russia-Ukraine war broke, but eased at Sh68,849 last year. Producing 51.9 million tonnes annually, Russia ranks as the third largest fertiliser producer globally, trailing the US which produces above 54 million tonnes, and India with an annual production of 52.6 million tonnes. It is not clear at what point the 564 tonnes of fertiliser donated to Kenya by Russia went missing.

The fertiliser disappeared in the middle of claims that NCPB distributed fake fertiliser through a subsidy programme. Eighty percent of legislators present in Parliament voted in favour of removal of Agriculture Cabinet Secretary Mithika Linturi for allegedly flouting constitutional provisions on integrity and the prudent use of public resources, according to the motion in the National Assembly.

The minister is alleged to have approved the “procurement and distribution of fake fertiliser.” He escaped the impeachment.

Yesterday, Mr Linturi did not respond to requests for comment on the whereabouts of the missing fertiliser, which could be applied on between 15,000 and 30,000 acres of land, at the rate of 50kg/acre to 100kg/acre.

The Auditor-General also notes that the NCPB has not produced a breakdown of costs associated with the raw material of fertiliser, including shipping cost, transportation cost from the port to the granulator and handling costs. The costs would shed light on how much the NCPB spent to have a 50kg bag of the finished product.

“In the circumstances, the accuracy and completeness of the fertiliser granulation costs and the quantities of the various fertilisers granulated could not be confirmed,” Ms Gathungu says.

The government continues to maintain the importance of the fertiliser subsidy programme, committing about a fifth of the budget to the agriculture sector to the programme.","The 564 tonnes of the missing raw fertiliser would have produced 1,643 tonnes of ready-to-use fertiliser, valued at Sh197 million at the market price of Sh6,000 for a 50kg bag.

Business Daily,https://www.businessdailyafrica.com/bd/economy/murkomen-on-the-spot-for-delay-lowering-expressway-toll-fees-4676186,2024-07-02,03:00:00 UTC,Murkomen on the spot for delay lowering Expressway toll fees,"The Kenyan government has delayed lowering Nairobi Expressway toll charges despite the falling inflation and strengthening of the shilling against the dollar, boosting the earnings of the Chinese firm that owns the road.

The Business Daily has established that the Ministry of Roads and Transport is sitting on an advisory from the Kenya National Highways Authority (Kenha) to lower the toll charges that were reviewed upwards on January 1.

The highways authority, which regulates the expressway operations, reckons that the strengthening of shilling and lower inflation should trigger a drop in the toll charges.

“We had mentioned the need to reduce toll fees to the PS,” said a top official at Kenha, who sought anonymity given the sensitivity of the matter.

“The adjustment could be at the CS’s whims and they (the contractor) have no control. It is the CS who can gazette.”

The current toll charges were based on inflation at 6.85 percent and the shilling at Sh143.75 against the dollar.

The shilling has since February extended gains against the dollar as Kenya’s settlement of the Eurobond that matured in June calmed investors, pushing the local currency to Sh129.50 from Sh157.32 at the start of the year.

Inflation also dropped to a 44-month low of 4.6 percent in June compared to 6.6 percent in December, bringing the cost of living measure to within the State’s target range of 2.5 percent to 7.5 percent.

After the adjustment of toll fees in January, motorists driving saloon cars from Mlolongo to Nairobi Westlands saw their user fees increase by 38.9 percent to Sh500 from the rate of Sh360 that had been set earlier in April 2022.

Driving the same vehicle from Westlands to Jomo Kenyatta International Airport (JKIA) costs Sh410, an increase of more than a third from Sh300. The toll for the distance between Museum Hill and the JKIA.

Motorists had hoped for lower rates to be announced from July 1 in line with macro-economic changes.

The law gives the Cabinet Secretary for Transport the powers to adjust the toll rates downwards if inflation falls and the shilling strengthens as part of the public private partnership (PPP) that the country inked with the Chinese contractor — Moja Expressway, a subsidiary of China Road and Bridge Construction (CRBC).

On December 19, Transport Cabinet Secretary Kipchumba Murkomen issued a Kenya Gazette notice announcing the higher charges that took effect on January 1.

The reluctance to reduce the toll rates has parallels with the rocket-and-feather pricing where upstream changes are adjusted upwards at rocket-speeds while the lower prices come down at the pace of a feather.

Monday, Mr Murkomen did not respond to requests for comments via calls and text messages.

The State opened a window allowing the Chinese company to adjust the Nairobi Expressway toll charges annually based on inflation in fees that will be paid in dollars. The inaugural toll charges were based on the dollar trading at Sh103.79 and reviewed based on inflation and the rate of the shilling to the dollar. This technically means that the toll charges are dollar-based and will cushion the Chinese operator from exchange rate losses. It has since reviewed the rates upwards twice.

The Chinese firm is expected to earn an estimated Sh106.8 billion profit for the 27 years it will own the double-decker road.

The expressway involves a four-lane and six-lane dual carriageway within the existing median of Mombasa Road/Uhuru Highway/Waiyaki Way and 11 interchanges or exits and entry routes that act as toll ramps.

The toll charges are forecast to generate Sh302.5 billion revenues, which will offer the Chinese firm an annual profit of Sh3.9 billion.

At Sh3.9 billion, CRBC’s forecast annual earnings from the double-decker road dwarfs the profits of the majority of firms listed on the Nairobi Securities Exchange (NSE) — underlining the outsized cash the expressway will generate over the 27 years.

Toll fees were introduced in the late 1980s but were scrapped in the mid-90s in favour of the roads maintenance levy currently charged at Sh18 per litre of petrol and diesel.

The return of toll fees is the result of using private investments in State infrastructure to build roads, energy plants and housing, with investors recouping their cash from charging user fees.

Kenya is seeking to maintain the pace of spending on new infrastructure with funding from private backers while reducing borrowings and the budget deficit.

The government is planning for more highways to be constructed through the PPP arrangement, depending on the success of the two.","The highways authority, which regulates the expressway operations, reckons that the strengthening of shilling and lower inflation should trigger a drop in the toll charges.

“We have dropped the Finance Bill. What does that mean? It means we have gone back almost two years. It means that this year, we are going to borrow Sh1 trillion to be able to run our government,” said Dr Ruto.

Interestingly, even after saying that borrowing would increase, from the initial target of Sh597 billion to Sh1 trillion, the President still claimed that the rejected Finance Bill would have huge consequences on certain expenditures the government had lined up.

“It means we will not confirm the JSS (Junior Secondary School) teachers, 46,000 of them; it means we cannot support the farmers with Sh2 billion for us to make sure that farmers get a fair return of Sh50 per kilo per milk; it means cannot sort out the coffee debt; it means we cannot support the cherry,” said the President.

Other victims of the decision by the government to shelve the finance billion from widespread protests include sugar cane farmers in Mumias, said the head of state. He added that Kenya will continue importing potatoes, to the chagrin of local producers.

Additionally, in the same interview, President Ruto agreed with the push to scrap the controversial offices of the First Lady as well as those of the spouses of Deputy President Rigathi Gachagua and Prime Cabinet Secretary Musalia Mudavadi.

But with the conflicting statements, the President has only added more confusion on the budget for the fiscal year starting this month.

The budget is a balancing act. The expenditure and revenue sides have to balance. On the expenditure side, is the spending by the national government (Executive, Parliament, and Judiciary) and the 47 counties. And on the revenue side, there are taxes, non-tax revenues, grants, and loans.

If the President increased the borrowing target to Sh1 trillion, the country’s total spending would remain at Sh3.997 trillion. Increasing the borrowing by Sh403 billion to Sh1 trillion would mean a Sh57 billion increase in the size of the budget.

But on June 28, when President Ruto passed the Appropriations Bill, which he said would “guarantee continuity of government operations, especially in providing critical services,” he had a different perspective. He did not talk of the government increasing borrowing, but he talked of reducing expenditure including by his office.

“I have therefore assented to the Appropriations Bill 2024 and instructed the National Treasury to immediately prepare supplementary estimates to reduce expenditure by the amount of revenue that was expected to be generated by the rejected Finance Bill,” said Ruto in a statement.

“The reduction in expenditure, amounting to Sh346 billion, will be borne eaquitable by both levels of government: the national and county governments. With respect to the national government, the reduction will be borne by the Executive, the Legislature, the Judiciary, and our constitutional commissions,” added the head of State.

In his speech, while rejecting the Finance Bill on Wednesday last week, President Ruto had called for expenditure cuts to cover the expected shortfalls in revenues, including allocations to the Executive.

Dr Ruto, whose administration has come under pressure for wasteful spending since the anti-tax protests started, directed for implementation of austerity measures that would involve expenditure cuts affecting all levels of government.

“I direct that operational expenditure in the Presidency be reduced to remove allocations for the confidential vote, reduce travel budget, hospitality and purchase of motor vehicles, renovations, and other expenditures,” he said.

The Finance Bill 2024, which has since been withdrawn following widespread protests that left scores dead, had intended to raise an additional Sh346 billion through various tax measures including the introduction of a 2.5 percent motor vehicle tax, the raising of excise duty on airtime and mobile money transfer fees.

Other tax measures in the condemned Finance Bill include the introduction of value-added tax (VAT) on bread, and increased excise duty on alcoholic beverages, cigarettes, and gambling. There was also a new eco levy that was to be applied on finished imported goods that were deemed harmful to the environment.","“We have dropped the Finance Bill.

The system hitch has caused a major backlog in the approval of dialysis sessions, inconveniencing thousands of patients with the life-threatening condition.

Patients fully reliant on NHIF have been forced to raise alternative cash to pay for dialysis or miss out on the treatment.

Jonathan Wala, chairman of the Kenya Renal Association, said that the NHIF has linked the situation to the initially planned switch to the new Social Health Insurance Fund (SHIF) on July 1. The shift to SHI has since been postponed to October 1, 2024, amid challenges with the digital platform designed to support contributions and registration into the scheme.

“Patients in need of dialysis in various hospitals have been forced to wait since there are a lot of claims that have not been approved because of the slow system. This is also causing a lot of confusion for both the healthcare providers and the patients,” he said.

“The challenges NHIF has created, the small transition time window, and the job security threat faced by employees makes this transition from NHIF to Social Health Authority (SHA) an even more precarious one,” Dr Wala added, noting that stand-alone dialysis centres are particularly affected by the issue as they have no other source of income apart from NHIF reimbursement. The stand-alone centres exclusively deal with renal ailment.

NHIF members are entitled to two dialysis sessions per week, each costing Sh9,500, bringing the total annual payment to an average of Sh960,000.

Healthcare providers have also reported technical problems with the main NHIF service portal, making it difficult to serve patients who now forced to pay cash for healthcare services. The system failure on the main NHIF portal was first reported on Friday.","A glitch in the National Health Insurance Fund (NHIF) entered its second week Monday, dealing a blow to patients reliant on it for payments towards kidney dialysis.

The lenders booked a pre-tax profit of Sh73.5 billion in the first three months of this year, new Central Bank of Kenya (CBK) data shows. The pre-tax profits earned in the three months to March represent a 12.9 percent increase on the Sh65.1 billion the banks realised over the same period last year.

The higher sector’s profit also indicates the industry’s resilience and agility to grow income amidst high interest rates and loan defaults.

“Quarterly profit before tax increased by Sh25 billion from Sh48.5 billion in the quarter ended December 2022 to Sh73.5 billion in the quarter ended March 2024. The increase in profitability was mainly attributable to an increase in quarterly income by Sh9.1 billion and a decrease in quarterly expenses by Sh15.9 billion,” CBK indicated.

The continued rise in profitability has been delivered against the backdrop of a faster drop in total operating expenses as the lenders’ incomes grow at a slower pace.

The overall drop in banks’ operating expenses has been despite rising costs to secure customer deposits and the requirement for higher provisions from rising loan defaults.

Top banks have nevertheless struggled to cut their overall expenses, pressured by high-interest expenses on customers from their huge deposit holdings and higher loan defaults.

Equity Group for instance saw its first quarter total operating expenses rise to Sh29.6 billion from Sh23.1 billion, as the bank nearly doubled its loan-loss provisions to Sh6 billion from Sh3.4 billion.

The lender however grew its net profit for the period by 25 percent as its first-quarter income climbed to Sh15.3 billion from Sh12.3 billion previously.

Its peer KCB also struggled with higher expenses in the opening quarter as interest costs hit Sh18 billion from Sh11.5 billion while loan-loss provisions were higher at Sh6.3 billion from Sh4.1 billion.

KCB however posted a quarterly profit of Sh16 billion from Sh9.5 billion previously on higher income.

Stanbic Bank Kenya was among the few outliers in the tier I category having trimmed its non-interest related expenses in the quarter to Sh4.7 billion from Sh5.6 billion on lower other expenses.

The lender however contended with higher interest expenses at Sh5.6 billion from Sh2.4 billion previously.

The bank posted a 2.7 percent rise in net profit in the quarter to Sh3.9 billion, a marginal change from a Sh3.8 billion net income in March 2023.

The banking industry's total assets declined by 2.7 percent in the three months to Sh7.5 trillion from Sh7.7 trillion in December, on the decrease of gross loans and advances to customers which fell to Sh4 trillion from Sh4.1 trillion at the end of 2023.

“The decrease in gross loans was largely witnessed in the manufacturing, personal and household, trade and real estate sectors. The decrease was mainly due to the foreign exchange rate decline. Foreign currency loans dropped from Sh1.2 trillion in December 2023 to Sh990.2 billion in March 2024,” CBK added.

Total deposits were, however, higher in March at Sh5.8 trillion from Sh5.5 trillion at the end of December even as foreign currency deposits dropped from Sh1.9 trillion to Sh1.6 trillion in the same period.

The industry’s asset quality meanwhile deteriorated further on rising defaults with the rate of non-performing loans spiking to 15.7 percent, from 14.8 percent at the end of the prior quarter.

Banks' capital and liquidity ratios however remain strong at 18.6 percent and 53.6 percent against a statutory requirement of 14.5 and 20 percent respectively.","Commercial banks’ profits jumped 12.9 percent in the three months to March on the backdrop of cost-cutting measures and higher income from loan interest charges, setting the stage for continued dividend and executive bonus boom.

NSE data shows that foreign net portfolio flows to the bourse in June were, however, lower than May’s Sh1.49 billion—a pointer to some waned appetite among the investors.

The net purchases trend by the offshore investors nonetheless stood for a third month since April when they took up Sh1billion worth of stocks --signifying the return of the external investors to the bourse.

Foreigners remained buyers of locally listed stocks in June, representing the third straight month of purchases by offshore investors which affirms confidence in the domestic market.

The consecutive foreign inflows to the NSE mark the extended confidence in the market by foreigners who were previously sellers, with the exits being driven by concerns about foreign exchange availability and better returns from higher interest rates in advanced economies.

The raising of interest rates by the Central Bank of Kenya (CBK) has improved the attraction of the local market to foreigners, while the improvements in the exchange rate have provided liquidity for offshore investors, allowing them to enter and exit the market at will.

A stronger Kenyan shilling has moreover sweetened the deal for the foreigners with dollar returns from the NSE peaking at 63.44 percent as of the end of May allowing investors cashing out to get more dollars for the same value of stocks sold in local currency after the rally.

The dollar returns from Kenya on a year-to-date basis have outperformed the average return of 5.95 percent from frontier markets according to the Morgan Stanley Capital International (MSCI) index.

Foreigners portfolio flows into the NSE, so far in 2024, currently stand at Sh644.7 million factoring in selloffs seen in the first three months of the year before the shifting of the tide.

The local bourse has also benefited from the favourable reviews including the end of restrictions on the availability of foreign exchange by the MSCI and the FTSE Russell indexes.

Kenya had been placed under the watch of the two investor service providers in 2022, following reports of foreign investors facing difficulties in accessing dollars from the local forex market to repatriate dividends and proceeds of share sales.

The red herring dented investor confidence by discouraging flows while forcing holders to hold off from selling in dollar-starved markets.

The NSE had expected the reclassification of the bourse to boost inflows from the foreigners.

NSE’s attraction to offshore investors has gotten a further lift from the inclusion of KCB Group to the MSCI frontier market index which has increased the counter’s visibility to foreigners.

KCB has joined Safaricom, Equity Group, and East African Breweries Plc who are already constituents of the frontier market index which captures large and mid-cap stocks across 28 markets.

Foreign investors are an integral part of the NSE bourse based on their active participation in trading activity.

Average foreign participation as a share of equity turnover has recovered from a low 30.1 percent in March 2023 to 62.84 percent in March this year according to additional data from the NSE.","Offshore investors bought a net Sh419.5 million worth of shares on the Nairobi Securities Exchange (NSE) in June, extending the trend to a third straight month.
NSE data shows that foreign net portfolio flows to the bourse in June were, however, lower than May’s Sh1.49 billion—a pointer to some waned appetite among the investors.
The net purchases trend by the offshore investors nonetheless stood for a third month since April when they took up Sh1billion worth of stocks --signifying the return of the external investors to the bourse.
Foreigners remained buyers of locally listed stocks in June, representing the third straight month of purchases by offshore investors which affirms confidence in the domestic market.

In a scandal exposing leakages within the Fund managing billions of shillings belonging to Kenyans, Auditor-General Nancy Gathungu reveals that in the year to June 2023, NHIF paid Sh814.9 million claims yet hospitals only billed Sh447.12 million through some 10 schemes.

The NHIF then blamed the excess payment on “typing errors” by hospital clerks, but could not provide proof of either having recovered the excess payments or asked the hospitals to reconcile the data, Ms Gathungu reveals.

“Review of payment data revealed that the hospitals billed Sh447,122,141 against claims paid amounting to Sh814,893,467 resulting to unexplained variance of Sh367,771,326,” Ms Gathungu said in her report on NHIF.

The audit reveals that in the year to June 2023, out of Sh37.1 million that different hospitals billed NHIF with regards to the Linda Mama scheme, the Fund paid Sh91.6 million (Sh54.5 million in excess).

In total, NHIF reported paying claims totaling Sh4.1 billion relating to Linda Mama Programme- which supports free child delivery for all women in the country.

The audit notes that claims relating to the programme were filled with possible cases of fraud, including instances of multiple duplications.

“The amount includes an amount of Sh5,713,000 paid to NHIF accredited hospitals whose analysis revealed 656 duplicate case code (01) on caesarean section deliveries procedures carried out on the same patient. Similarly, the amount includes a balance of Sh41,332,700 whose analysis revealed 10,860 duplicated case code (02) on normal deliveries on the same patient,” the audit notes.

Under the National Health Scheme (NHS) the audit also exposes instances of duplications and excess payments. In one instance while hospitals billed the Fund Sh280.6 million through the NHS Scheme, the NHIF paid Sh486.6 million (an excess of Sh205.9 million that the Fund did not explain).

The audit also exposes that out of a Sh12 billion debt owed to healthcare providers, Sh2.9 billion was found to contain “duplicated healthcare providers with the same name but different outstanding amounts and different hospital codes.”

The excess payments and duplications in claim payments were just part of the loopholes Ms Gathungu flagged in the management of the NHIF, which exposed it to loss of billions of shillings, even as patients relying on its cover continue to suffer poor services and denial of services in some instances.","The National Health Insurance Fund (NHIF) has claimed that it paid out Sh368 million in excess claims due to ""typing errors"" and has no proof of where the money went.

Home Afrika said it is looking to sell six housing units off its Mitini Scapes Development along Kiambu Road and Lake View Heights in Kisumu to repay its restructured debt facilities to the bank.

The company said as part of the debt restructuring programme, its directors engaged in negotiations with various lenders including I&M Bank, Cooperative Bank and NCBA Bank to restructure the defaulted facilities.

""During the year ended December 31, 2023, the directors negotiated a final and full settlement with the bank (I&M) of Sh100 million and the group paid Sh22 million during the year, towards settlement of the loan balance,"" said Home Afrika.

""The outstanding balance of Sh79 million will be repaid in the next financial year from proceeds realised from the sale of six housing units under Mitini Scapes Development Limited and the sale of 5 acres of land under Lake View Heights Limited in Kisumu.""

The firm did not disclose how much it had borrowed from I&M Bank and other lenders but in the year ended December, borrowings from I&M Bank amounted to Sh78.9 million from Sh141.3 million in 2022.

The loans were secured by Sh1.3 billion worth of guarantors including a mortgage, debenture and an indemnity corporate guarantee both personal and joint, from the directors.

The developer also has borrowed funds from lenders after failing to raise money privately from a bond issue in 2014.

""The management negotiated for full and final settlement of Sh320 million and Sh460.95 million with Cooperative Bank and NCBA Bank Kenya Plc respectively during the year under review.""

The property firm said the negotiations were key in bringing down their finance costs by 37 percent in the year under review while borrowing and private bonds also decreased by 25 percent. The firm is also in battle over an asset with Ecobank after failing to repay a facility.

The bank went to court to liquidate the asset but the high court ordered the pan-African bank to repurchase the property at market value.

The World Bank said it debarred the EY Kenya after investigations revealed it was guilty of conflict of interest and corruption in two public programmes in Somalia.

EY Kenya was found in breach of the bank's code of conduct relating to the Somali Core Economic Institutions and Opportunities Program (Score) and the Second Public Financial Management Capacity Strengthening Project (PFM II).

“According to the facts of the case, EY Kenya failed to disclose a conflict of interest during the selection and implementation of four contracts under the Score and PFM II projects, and the involvement of an agent in those contracts,” read the statement from the WB published on June 26.

“In addition, during the execution of one of the contracts, EY Kenya made a provision for allowances to be paid to project officials. This conduct constitutes fraudulent and corrupt practices under the World Bank Consultant Guidelines.”

The sanctions dent EY Kenya’s reputation because potential clients or even partners may keep off for fear of association with a tainted firm. This can lead to a loss of business opportunities and a decrease in competitive edge in the market.

EY Kenya is the latest Kenyan firm to have been blacklisted by the WB on any projects being financed by the Washington-based institution.

“It is part of a settlement agreement under which the company admits culpability for sanctionable practices and agrees to meet specified integrity compliance conditions as a requirement for release from debarment. “

Business Daily,https://www.businessdailyafrica.com/bd/lifestyle/gardening/how-jacqie-abuga-built-her-dream-home-garden-4675866,2024-07-02,01:00:00 UTC,"How Jacqie Abuga built her dream home, garden","Jacqie Abuga’s house is the ‘house on the hill.’ As you get into her driveway you climb up a steep hill. It is here, in Karen, that Jacqie’s beautiful garden comes to life and her four-bedroom mansion nears completion.

Ms Abuga takes us through her journey of home ownership.

“I bought this quarter-acre piece of land for Sh5 million in 2011 and left it fallow until 2016. Back then there was no road. I didn’t initially plan to build a home, the plan was to hold on to it and let its value appreciate. But things took a turn when I got access to fairly priced mortgage facilities,” explains Ms Abuga.

Then came her dilemma; whether to buy or to build a house.

“With the mortgage, I could afford ready-made houses that were way out of town, but they didn’t have a garden. So I figured, I could build on the piece of land.”

Having decided to build on the piece of land, Ms Abuga had to contend with the steep terrain that her land lay on.

“It took about a year to get the plans in place because first, the architect did not take cognisance that the land was not flat as his drawings indicated. Of course, there was a way we could lower the ground level. Unfortunately on one side of the land is a huge slab of rock which would have required that I blast it with dynamite, a process that would affect my neighbours,” Ms Abuga tells the BDLife.

So she got a new architect.

“The new architect was like ‘but this is already a solid foundation. We can build on it instead of digging deep into it,” Jacqie says.

When she started building she then realised “there will be empty places in some parts of the house which meant an additional room I had not budgeted for, so the cost went up,” she notes.

The bank was not happy about the changes so even with the mortgage she had to dig deep into her pockets to build her house.

“I started gardening in 2016 as the house was being constructed. I started with the kei apple fence and the bougainvillaea on the front because it is very beautiful and at some point in the year, around March and November, it is filled with pink and white flowers. In 2018, when I moved here, I added the duranta.”

Gardening journey

Ms Abuga grew up on a farm in Kericho where they had a lot of space and grass. “I’d always tell myself that if I had my way, I would design the garden in a particular way. I never actualised my dream in my parents’ compound so when I got this place, I said, ‘This is now the time for me.”

Her Karen land being a very hilly place, Ms Abuga needed to level the ground to create her garden. She spent almost Sh1 million on terracing to create different levels and layers of the garden.

“I used a lot of stone and red soil to backfill this garden. I had to get the levels right before I started landscaping. This was done all while the house construction was taking place. It was quite costly but I was determined to make it a garden so I didn’t stop at anything,” says the communication specialist.

She adds, “I grew up on a farm where we got all the food from the farm. The only thing we ever bought was sugar and flour. I was determined to have that for myself.”

Jacqie’s garden is divided into three levels.

The white garden

The first level is her white garden which is still coming into shape. “If you look there is no flower here that is of a different colour. It is all green and white. Even the rose here is white.” At the centre is the fragrant yesterday today and tomorrow flower.

The Arabica grass

The second level of her garden is the masterpiece. This is where her well-pampered Arabica grass resides.

“I have uprooted the grass three times until finally, I settled for Arabica. Everyone will discourage you and tell you that Arabica is very stubborn and is hard to grow. I agree it’s a very needy type of grass because it needs a lot of water and fertiliser. The first two types of grass I had planted were not very ‘carpety’ or bouncy. There was first, Kikuyu grass, which attracts weeds so it becomes difficult to maintain. Then there as the Zimbabwe grass which is okay but it is the grass that you are growing when you are not trying hard enough. But with Arabica grass, if you take care of me, it will take care of you,” the mother of two fondly says about her one-year-old grass.

On this second level, the grass grows on its own and on the edges grows her trees.

“I decided that I will not have any plants on the grass so that in case I have a function, I have a place to host the guests. Surrounding this area (the second level) is the bamboo which I want to form a boundary fence between the garden and the pathway. For the trees, my most treasured one is the araucaria pine tree. I have always wanted a pine tree so that come Christmas time we are able to drape it with lights,” she tells us.

Other trees in the garden are the Thika palms and the traveller’s palm.

The vegetable garden

The third level of Jacqie’s garden is her vegetable garden where she grows her tomatoes, kales, spinach and fruit trees including the loquats, tree tomatoes, bananas, oranges, and hass avocado trees.

Ms Abuga utilises various items to hold her plants. Apart from used cans, car tyres are also used as planters.

“Every time I have a changeover of tyres I come and use them in the garden. My wheelbarrow broke down, so I painted it white and here it is now with some plants.

The grand entrance

In Jacqie’s garden is an array of potted plants neatly arranged as you climb the stairway to her house. At a distinct position is her Irish ivy that is held by circular wire and the dark pink anthurium growing on the same pot.

The potted plants give you a warm embrace as you get into the house.

“Part of the reason I have this stairway is because of the terrain. I did not want to sink my house lower so I was like ‘Why don’t I have a grand entrance into the house?’ I love pink so you’ll notice that most of my potted flowers have a little pink here and there,” she explains.

Apart from the healthy anthuriums, as you walk into Jacqie’s house you’ll get to experience the beautiful fuschias, the all-seasons jade plant and the purple-pink Egyptian starcluster.

Taking care of the garden

Having a beautiful well-maintained garden does not come cheaply.

“Because of the rains at the moment, I don’t need to water the garden but when it is dry, we water every morning and evening. When there is no rain, my water consumption shoots up by at least Sh2000 a month. In a month, I spend around Sh15,000 on maintaining the garden depending also on the plants I have to buy. I mostly work with a gardener who comes in twice a week to maintain it. Gardening is a journey, today you think you’re okay then tomorrow you have a light bulb moment and think ‘I could change this or add that plant. Your love for gardens has to come from within for you to care about it,” says Jacqie who prides herself on having created the garden at her workplace.

Her biggest challenge has been the termites “because there is red soil so you have to do the termite fumigation often. Moles also come in to destroy the plants.”

Advice for homeowners

For those seeking to own a home, Ms Abuga advises, that you consider the terrain of the land as you settle on the mortgage. You should also get a like-minded architect.

“You need someone who is not stiff and can tap into your dream. Get someone who is flexible, creative and can think out of the box. Bear in mind that there will always be unforeseen costs,” she says.

Being present during the construction is essential.","Jacqie Abuga’s house is the ‘house on the hill.’ As you get into her driveway you climb up a steep hill.

Businesses and investments have become tricky to run. And sometimes, marital relationships are built on foundations that might be considered sandy.

Some people end up together only based on the financial benefits they receive from their partners. Nowadays, it is not uncommon for spouses to help each other out in financial matters concerning the household.

The growth and a couple’s standing in society is also considered not only in terms of the family’s size (children) and careers of the spouses but also their financial muscle and assets accumulation.

However, financial or money matters are also among the leading causes of strain in many marriages. When hard times happen in most unions, it is not unheard of that a partner will walk away from the situation.

Some even refuse to bail out the other if they feel either the finances required will endanger the financial capabilities of the family or the risk is too high. Sometimes, a spouse can find themselves locked out of what they thought were investments or properties they thought were matrimonial property.

Matrimonial property

Matrimonial property is any property that you acquire during the subsistence of the marriage. However, matrimonial property can only be put in place where no other law supersedes it.

For example, unless spouses open a joint account when putting money in financial institutions, then whoever is stated as “next of kin” or “beneficiary” gets left with the money after the demise or incapacity (physical or mental inability to manage one's affairs).

Martha Nzomo, an accredited financial adviser working at ICEA Lions Group helps individuals, companies and groups invest their money depending on their short-term, medium-term and long-term needs. She also helps do pension transfers and consolidation.

“In my experience, not everyone automatically puts their spouses as next of kin. Because it’s not a must, I can put my father, mother, sister or brother. Unless I come and update that later,” says Ms Nzomo.

She says people prefer putting the names of people they trust in the beneficiary’s clause of their investment products’ forms as you don't need to put your spouse. Others say they are doing that to diversify and ensure there’s no family conflict since they’ve already put their spouses on their other investments.

Joint accounts

In instances where couples want to have a short-term savings account, like a money market account where you can access money from time to time, the company’s policy is that they must have opened a joint bank account where the money can be deposited when making withdrawals.

“Today, we may have been on good terms and we opened a joint money market account. But along the way we fall out. Who are they then supposed to pay that money to? How are they supposed to favour one party over the other? We can’t pick sides,” says Ms Nzomo on the reason for the policy.

However, for things like school fees policy, because it is done through consent. The couple can decide to who the money is sent in the end; after maturity of the policy.

Outline financial obligations

However, she believes that agreeing that the financial obligations that they each individually had before coming together should stay separate and not automatically consolidated is the best way.

“Whatever you did with your money, that’s yours. Whatever I did with mine, that’s mine. However, you need to state what the purpose of opening a joint account is, like family trips or the children’s future education. Always make sure the mandate (how the account is to be run) requires both of your consents; on everything,” says Ms Nzomo, who has been in the industry for slightly over 10 years.

Read the fine print

Another thing you might want to also do is make sure you read all documents on matters financial that a spouse brings to you with regards to assets or accounts you hold together. The law states that ignorance is not a defence, and that also comes down to where a spouse claims they did not know what the other person was attaching as collateral to loans taken for various reasons.

“You may have owned a piece of land, but while in a marriage you built on that piece of land. The buildings then become matrimonial property while the land remains individual property. Matrimonial property is co-owned with your spouse even if they did not contribute money in their acquisition through what is called contribution in kind. However, the other spouse has to have knowledge of the dealings of the other or else they won’t be able to claim these,” says Christine Muthoni, an advocate of the High Court.

After divorce

After a divorce, the next thing that happens is the division of property. If you have a lawyer, you will file a suit called a declaration of interest in matrimonial property. A good lawyer will file this even before filing for division of matrimonial property; pending hearing and determination of the divorce; to ask for an injunction giving a list of the properties one knows they own so that they are not interfered with.

Interference may include transfer of ownership to either one’s mother or a company they have registered, or selling off of some property whose benefits they believe the other spouse shouldn’t be able to enjoy.

Even inheritance received during the subsistence of a marriage becomes matrimonial property and the other spouse is entitled to a share of that, says Ms Muthoni.

“If you don’t want your spouse to interfere with anything you acquired before or during your marriage, I encourage people to do pre-nuptial agreements. Disclosure is important. You list down everything and say in case of a divorce, the property I have before the date of the marriage cannot be touched,” adds the certified divorce coach, by the International Coach Federation – ICF, who is a published author with her book Conscious Uncoupling.","Sometimes, a spouse can find themselves locked out of what they thought were investments or properties they thought were matrimonial property.

But to elevate it into a work of art, infusing the right shades of colour is essential.

When Shirley Kadoch moved to Kenya from her country in the Middle East almost a decade ago, it struck her how most Kenyan homeowners were reluctant to experiment with colourful flowers and plant. It was always a dash of colour here and there in a sea of green.

“I have always loved flowers. Back in my country, I was a garden designer,” says Shirley.

She wanted to continue her career in garden design, but the local market was less vibrant.

“I realised that though roadside vendors had some good varieties, they didn’t have everything I was used to,” she says of the moment she decided to open a flower shop.

As a designer, I always look for bright colours. I wanted to offer a varied and beautiful mix of colours and greenery,” says Shirley.

In the last few years, her Flower Factory in Karen, Nairobi has helped homeowners create magnificent gardens. Retailers and corporates have also been turning to her to make their gardens awe-inspiring spaces.

Business journey

Starting a business can feel like playing snakes and ladders, with its ups and downs.

For Shirley, resilience and a strong passion for bringing together a unique collection of flowers and creating beautiful gardens have helped her navigate the tough entrepreneurship landscape in Kenya.

“It started as a small shop and slowly grew into something big. Now, as you can see, it looks magnificent,” says Shirley.

Current operations

Nestled within the tranquil Talisman Restaurant in Karen, the Flower Factory Garden is a haven for nature lovers. Shirley says the name of the garden was informed by her anticipation of producing numerous flowers. What began with just three flowers has now grown into a vibrant collection of houseplants, herbs, and fruit trees.

The garden also offers hanging baskets, stylish pots, and essential gardening tools. This carefully curated collection, Shirley says, aims to add colour and vitality to both indoor and outdoor spaces.

“Here you will experience the perfect blend of gardening simplicity and fun, all in a unique environment that reconnects you with nature,” she says.

Varieties

The Flower Factory is home to more than 30 species of potted plants, including the short-lived, tender Argyranthemum that blooms in full sun, the ornamental Calibrachoa which grows best in a pot, and Chrysanthemum, Dahlia, Dianthus, Fuchsia Jollies, Gaura, and Gerbera, each with more than three varieties.

The large number of varieties allows her to maintain a wide range of stock for her customers.

“We are always adding more and more. Each time we introduce something new to keep our customers interested. Once you have a bag of flowers, you keep coming back for more,” she says.

Her favourite flower, the petunia, comes in up to five varieties in pink, red, white, and purple, for both standing and hanging pots. It is also a top seller.

“I love the colours, the shape, and the fact that it comes in so many varieties,” she says.

Because they are annuals, Ms Kadoch stresses that they should be replaced every six months.

“I usually recommend using mostly perennials in your garden and leaving a small area for seasonal colour. Since adding colour with annuals is not expensive, you can change it twice a year and still have an amazing effect,” she notes.

The garden also includes Lobularia, New Guinea; an annual flower that lasts one full growing season. There are also ornamental grasses, portulaca, salvia, and sunflowers, which she buys either as seeds or seedlings, and take between two and six months to flower, depending on the plant.

Herb garden

The herb garden has mint, with up to five varieties, including pineapple and chocolate, as well as lemongrass, strawberry, coriander, parsley, rosemary, thyme, curry, sage, and aloe vera.

The basil comes in three varieties, including regular, Thai, and holy basil for her Indian customers.

“I like to have a variety of plants because it attracts a lot of customers and we also want to keep it interesting,” she says.

In the middle of the garden is a bird bath decorated with petunias to add to the fun. Water and seeds are added to attract birds to the garden, creating an almost complete ecosystem.

Flower Factory's most prized possessions come from local growers, major stores, and their farm in Athi River, where they grow many of their flowers.

Her clients include China Square, Carrefour supermarkets and other companies through partnerships.

“Not everyone likes to come to Karen, so we try to reach them everywhere,” she says.

Challenges and successes

“The business is hard, hectic, but it’s fun. The turnover, half of it goes to our customers, the partnerships, so it doesn’t represent our profits. But we are not complaining. We are constantly investing in equipment, greenhouses, and agronomists to train our staff,"" says Shirley.

She adds, “We face challenges such as climate change affecting sunlight, excessive humidity leading to bacterial growth, and reduced shelf life.”

Surrounding oneself with beautiful plants has a positive effect on mental health and well-being. The 44-year-old mother of three says that flowers and gardens have always made her feel younger.

Future plans

Looking ahead, she is striving for improve her business. Her team, which has grown from three to nearly 50, serves as a vital support system. She credits their strength and dedication for keeping her motivated.

The success of the Flower Factory, she says, also depends on loyal customers who return for more plants and advice.","In the last few years, her Flower Factory in Karen, Nairobi has helped homeowners create magnificent gardens.

Justice Sewe further noted that the stance taken by KPA against the Mombasa water firm's application for leave was unsustainable.

The company, led by its director Peterson Mitau, approached the court following their victory in a case against the parastatal last year.

Business Daily,https://www.businessdailyafrica.com/bd/economy/kenya-bets-on-carbon-markets-in-20-year-green-growth-drive-4676090,2024-07-01,22:00:00 UTC,Kenya bets on carbon markets in 20-year green growth drive,"The government says Kenya is creating an enabling environment to inspire confidence in investors and attract carbon finance in the country’s climate-positive growth drive.

Speaking at the Carbon Markets Conference in Nairobi in April, Bianca Gichangi, a carbon markets expert and adviser at the Office of the Climate Envoy, Executive Office of the President of Kenya, said the country has been active in the carbon markets space for more than two decades and is a leader in Africa with around 23 percent market share of voluntary carbon credits issued.

According to Ms Gichangi, carbon markets are prioritised as a pivotal component of Kenya’s climate-positive growth and carbon credits are envisioned as the next major export.

This is why on the path to realising this vision, Kenya has marked notable strides by establishing robust legal and institutional frameworks through amending the Climate Change Act to incorporate carbon markets and is close to finalising regulations that provide clarity on implementation.

But what is carbon trading and what are carbon markets?

Dr Olufunso Somorin, the regional principal officer of, the climate change and green growth programme for East Africa at the African Development Bank Group(AfDB) said we are in an era where we need trillions, if not billions to respond to the devastating impacts of the climate crisis.

“There is an international mechanism under Article 6 of the Paris Agreement that sets out how countries can pursue voluntary cooperation to reach their climate targets.

“It enables international cooperation to tackle climate change and unlock financial support for developing countries.”

This, he says, means that under Article 6, countries can transfer carbon credits earned from the reduction of greenhouse gas emissions to help one or more countries meet their climate targets.

Through this mechanism, a company in one country can reduce emissions and have those reductions credited for sale to another company in a different country.

That second company may use them to comply with its emission obligations or to help it meet net-zero targets.

Dr Somorin said there are three tools countries can draw upon under Article 6, one of which is the Paris Agreement Crediting Mechanism (PACM)—the UN’s new high-integrity carbon crediting mechanism.

“This international mechanism allows possible projects for climate mitigation such as carbon sequestration—the process of capturing and storing atmospheric carbon dioxide to reduce the amount of the gas in the atmosphere in efforts to ease global warming—to happen in developing countries paid for by a country paid for by a country or entity in a developed country.

“So if you can’t fully achieve emissions reduction in your country because of the system, there’s an opportunity for you to achieve emissions reduction in another country, and that reduction in another country generates carbon credits which can be sold by the country supplying those credits to the countries that are in demand of those credits, that trading is what the carbon markets are about, it’s a very complex market,” he said.

The expert adds that there is a very big difference between carbon trading and greenwashing.

“One key element of the carbon market is that it is a trust market, when I pay you to generate carbon credits, you have to do it. Greenwashing is misleading the public to believe that an entity is doing so, it promotes false solutions to the climate crisis that distract from and delay concrete and credible action.”

Greenwashing manifests itself in several ways, including claiming to be on track to cut a company’s emissions when no credible plan is in place, being purposely vague about a company’s operations or materials used, applying intentionally misleading labels such as “green” or “eco-friendly,” which do not have standard definitions and can be easily misinterpreted, implying that a minor improvement has a major impact, or promoting a product that meets the minimum regulatory requirements as if it is significantly better than the standard.

According to the UN, the science is clear.

“Greenhouse gas emissions, such as carbon and methane, from human activities are wrapping the Earth in a blanket of pollution that has warmed the planet and led to severe impacts such as more intense storms, droughts, floods, and wildfires.

Greenwashing undermines credible efforts to reduce emissions and address the climate crisis. Through deceptive marketing and false claims of sustainability, greenwashing misleads consumers, investors, and the public, hampering the trust, ambition, and action needed to bring about global change and secure a sustainable planet.”

This is why, according to Ms Gichangi, Kenya will soon be unveiling frameworks to promote high-integrity carbon market activities and provide an enabling policy environment for investment and flow of carbon finance into enhancing energy access, safeguarding our terrestrial and marine ecosystems, boosting agricultural yields, and contributing to green industrialisation.

“There’s an opportunity to build technical capacity and generate employment for our burgeoning population. End-to-end integrity in carbon markets is crucial to ensuring the credibility and effectiveness of carbon market activities, providing confidence to investors and stakeholders that carbon credits represent genuine environmental and social benefits. It safeguards against double counting and fosters transparency that enhances trust in the carbon market system,” she said.

Ms Gichangi added that last year, at the world’s biggest climate meet in Dubai (COP28), President William Ruto launched the Africa Green Industrialisation initiative, building upon the Nairobi Declaration, with a vision to propel green industries in the country and on the continent.

Kenya, endowed with abundant renewable energy, aspires to boost its renewable energy production from 3GW to 100 GW by 2040. This ambitious goal will position Kenya as a premier green industrial hub, attract international ventures, and foster the adoption of carbon management technologies, she said.













According to the government, the rise of e-mobility in Kenya is set to reduce reliance on fossil fuels, mitigating urban air pollution and enhancing public health.

“Carbon revenues can subsidize electric vehicle technology, promoting its adoption while leveraging more climate finance through public-private partnerships.

Additionally, the country aims to address energy access challenges by utilizing carbon finance to subsidize transformative high tier clean cooking technologies, benefiting 45 million Kenyans without access to clean cooking by the end of the decade,” Ms Gichangi added.

Dr Somorin agrees with Ms Gichangi that the ordinary Kenyan can and will benefit from all this.

“The question should be how can an average group of people within a defined scope of project benefit?”

Here explains that there is an opportunity within the carbon market structure which is an incentive market for the ordinary people to benefit but in order for that to happen it has to be done at scale which means people have to register as a group or community and do projects together.

This is because the cost of transacting most carbon projects is very high which is why one has to do it at scale for it to make economic sense.

“This is why we have been here for two days; to discuss how we can turn carbon market opportunities in priority sectors into real investment.

We have been expounding on different innovative finance models and the role local financial institutions can play in supporting private sector project developers as well as unpacking the complexities of pricing and building infrastructure to enhance integrity, transparency, and accounting, “MS Gichangi said.

On the question of the amount of land / trees needed to execute carbon trading initiatives, Dr Somorin told climate action that there are multiple approaches when it comes to removing carbon dioxide from the atmosphere.

“Some of the opportunities that give the biggest emission reduction are largely land-based first of all which is why there’s a lot of interest in trees and forests, this is what we call nature-based solutions.

The reason for this is because of the biology of life, a tree absorbs carbon dioxide from the atmosphere and releases oxygen and so when you have millions of trees the more photosynthesis happens but when it comes to how many trees one needs, there’s no straight answer, this is because no two trees sequester carbon the same way.”

He explains that there is a difference in sequestration between an older tree and a younger one, there’s also a difference in sequestration between a tree in Europe and a tree in Africa as well as tiny trees that are fast growing and huge trees that are slow growing.

“We have an advantage in Africa because the type of tree species that we have here are the best when it comes to sequestration globally, that’s why there is a lot of interest.”

Apart from trees, he points out that biofuels can also be used for carbon trading.

Dr Somorin reminds that the world is on the threshold of transitioning from the petroeconomy, fuelled by carbon from the past, to the bioeconomy, fuelled by biomass created through photosynthesis.

The petroeconomy is overwhelmingly carbon positive—contributing carbon to the load already imposed, and increasing at the rate of approximately eight gigatonnes per year.

The bioeconomy is widely considered to be carbon neutral, in that the carbon emitted through burning replaces the carbon absorbed during the growing of the crop.

However, a furious debate has been ongoing over the real degree of carbon neutrality achieved by biofuels, with some produced in temperate climates such as North America and Europe being argued to be almost entirely carbon positive, due to the heavy inputs of fossil-fuelled activities and products such as fertilizers.

“If you shift from fossil fuel powered systems to clean energy systems such as hydro, geothermal, wind or solar energy that is a potential carbon project and in fact some of the geothermal projects in Kenya have been funded through carbon finance,” he told Climate Action.

Ali Mohammed, the special envoy on Climate Change at the Office of the President of the Republic of Kenya said that contrary to what many people have been saying, the government does not do carbon credit deals in secret.","According to Ms Gichangi, carbon markets are prioritised as a pivotal component of Kenya’s climate-positive growth and carbon credits are envisioned as the next major export.

Among these methods is body transformation, where actors either add or lose a lot of weight in the process of ""becoming"" the character.

A good example would be 50 Cent in All Things Fall Apart (2011), and of course, Christian Bale, who is known for taking on various forms and sizes for different projects. Lupita Nyong'o has now joined this group. If you've been following her over the last few months, you may have noticed her frail appearance, which at times had her fans concerned and worried. With time we came to discover that the weight was for movie which just came came out (June 27, 2024)

So, did the sacrifice and effort she put into the project pay off?

A Quiet Place: Day One

A Quiet Place: Day One is a 2024 American apocalyptic horror film written and directed by Michael Sarnoski. It is based on a story by Sarnoski and John Krasinski, which is the third installment in the A Quiet Place film series. This installment acts both as a spin-off and prequel to the previous films.

Lupita stars as a terminally ill woman navigating the early stages of an invasion in New York City by extraterrestrial creatures with exceptionally acute hearing. The supporting cast includes Joseph Quinn, Alex Wolff, and Djimon Hounsou, reprising his role from the second film.

Heads up

This is a blockbuster summer movie; however, unlike your conventional apocalypse film, it isn't solely about action and explosive scenes with an indestructible protagonist. Instead, it focuses much more on character development. Don't get me wrong. The action and creatures are still there, but the director and producers clearly understood the caliber of actors at their disposal and chose to fully capitalise on their talents.

So, if you are going into this expecting an action creature feature, consider yourself warned.

What works

The exposition in this film is handled very well. Rather than spoon-feeding the audience, the screenplay allows the story and character arcs to evolve organically. Visual cues play a significant role in advancing the narrative, particularly since silence is pivotal in the film, forcing actors to rely solely on expressions.

The performances are outstanding. Alex Wolff, nearly unrecognisable, delivers a fantastic performance, and Joseph Quinn adds an intriguing layer to the story.

However, the standout is Lupita. She fully embodies her character, and her physical transformation adds profound visual depth to her portrayal. Her ability to convey emotions through facial and physical expressions is the cornerstone of the film. Although her character's motivation may seem unconventional, it remains clear throughout the movie.

The character development is also impressive. The protagonist is already going through a lot from the outset, and following her journey through the invasion stimulates empathy from the audience.

Another memorable character is Frodo the cat, whose atypical behavior contributes to some of the film's most tense moments.

The movie is full of tense and anxiety-inducing scenes, consistent with the thematic motif of the Quiet Place series.

While the creatures deliver expected terror with impressive visual effects and design, they take a secondary role in this character-driven narrative.

The cinematography beautifully captures New York City before and after the invasion, complementing the story's nature. Additionally, the costumes effectively define each character's personality.

Nitpicks

As mentioned earlier, it's important to emphasise: don't expect an action-packed alien invasion movie as the trailers might suggest.

While it stands as a worthy counterpart to the first two films, in terms of creature innovation, this installment doesn't introduce anything significantly new. Additionally, the story structure may feel somewhat familiar.

Final Word

While watching this movie, I found myself thinking of making this article more about why Lupita might be one of the best actors of this generation rather than focusing on a conventional movie review. She is really good in this film.","A Quiet Place: Day OneA Quiet Place: Day One is a 2024 American apocalyptic horror film written and directed by Michael Sarnoski.

According to the 32nd edition of the Cybersecurity Report by the Communications Authority of Kenya, the mind-boggling surge includes sophisticated malwares and social engineering scams that target corporate IT systems by duping employees to share their logins and passwords online.

Cybercriminals are constantly evolving their tactics that have enabled them to siphon cash from would-be victims inflicting devastating financial losses on unsuspecting companies. This growing threat has made a strong case for cybersecurity or cyber insurance, which offers a critical safety net for operating in this environment.

And online presence being a key lifeline for every company and government entity, every entity has no options but to maintain active online through their websites, software applications for both their internal and external customers.

Cyber insurance goes beyond traditional firewalls, providing businesses with financial protection against cyberattack-related costs.

This includes covering expenses related to data recovery, forensic investigations, legal fees, and even credit monitoring for affected customers.

Looking at the devastating impact that cybersecurity has on businesses, insurance is a worthy investment.

In 2022, for example, a new report released by global cybersecurity firm Trend Micro shows Kenya’s losses to cyber criminals reached Sh3.6 billion ($36 million), compared to Nigeria and South Africa where they are nearly tenfold at Sh50 billion ($500 million) and Sh57 billion ($570 million), respectively.

While cybercrime is now a grim reality, Kenya still lags in cyber insurance product development with the main challenge being a severe deficit of cybersecurity expertise. Kenya has a paltry 2,000 personnel mainly working for private firms compared to the current demand of between 40,000 to 50,000. The situation calls for urgent mitigation with each sector defining its cybersecurity needs.

For the insurance industry, the rigorous underwriting process and financial capacity needed to support it has become a key hindrance affecting most insurance companies’ ability to develop new products. To circumvent the challenges, insurance companies must adopt new technologies such as machine learning, artificial intelligence and data analytics to generate new solutions for a myriad of challenges being witnessed.

As we move along in technological advancement, a cyberattack is no longer a matter of “if” but “when” it will occur. That is why all businesses need to secure a cyber insurance policy to be cyber-ready. For all stakeholders in the sector, a challenge lies ahead on how to make the product readily available, affordable and tailored to the needs of those who need it.","This growing threat has made a strong case for cybersecurity or cyber insurance, which offers a critical safety net for operating in this environment.

This integration is not just a response to global sustainability trends but a proactive move to address local and regional challenges. By adopting ESG frameworks, insurance firms can contribute significantly to the sustainable development of the country.

The integration of ESG principles is transforming the industry, not just by altering investment patterns and underwriting practices, but by reshaping the very ethos of insurance companies. This transformation is driven by the recognition that long-term sustainability and profitability are inextricably linked to the well-being of the environment and society at large.

In Kenya, where the effects of climate change are discernible, the insurance sector's role in environmental stewardship is critical. By offering innovative products like Index-Based Flood and Crop Insurance, insurers are providing a safety net for those most vulnerable to climate-related disasters. These initiatives not only offer immediate financial relief but also encourage sustainable agricultural practices and disaster preparedness, contributing to the resilience of local economies.

Socially, the insurance industry's impact is profound. Through micro insurance offerings, insurers are bridging the gap in financial services for the underserved, fostering inclusivity and security. These programmes are more than just a business strategy; they represent a commitment to social equity and the upliftment of disadvantaged communities. By partnering with healthcare providers, insurers are also playing a pivotal role in improving health outcomes and promoting preventive healthcare, which is essential for the long-term health and productivity of the population.

Strong governance in insurance sector ensures accountability and transparency, which are vital for investor confidence and consumer trust. By adhering to international standards and best practices, Kenyan insurers are setting a precedent for ethical conduct and responsible business operations. This commitment to governance extends beyond compliance; it is about building a legacy of integrity that will define the future of the industry.

Moreover, ESG-focused insurance companies can influence public policy by advocating for regulations that support sustainable development. They can also collaborate with non-governmental organisations and the private sector to launch initiatives that address pressing ESG issues. Through these actions, the insurance industry can become a catalyst for positive change, driving economic growth while also ensuring the well-being of the environment and society.

The insurance sector's embrace of ESG is a testament to its adaptability and foresight. It reflects a deep understanding that the path to sustainable growth is paved with responsible practices that consider the broader impact on society and the environment. As the sector continues to evolve, its alignment with ESG principles will undoubtedly play a pivotal role in shaping a resilient and sustainable future for Kenya.","Kenya's insurance sector is poised to play a transformative role in integrating Environmental, Social, and Governance (ESG) principles into its operations.

National Assembly Speaker Moses Wetangula has since transmitted the President’s directive to the Assembly’s Finance and Planning Committee, which is expected to report back to the House upon resumption on July 23.

It is my prayer that among the proposals to be tabled by the Committee upon resumption will be the consideration of a Tax Laws Amendment Bill designed to salvage the progressive proposals that were contained in Finance Bill 2024 yet ended up being a victim of the withdrawal of the Bill in entirety.

How do we salvage the proposal to extend the just ended Tax Amnesty Programme from the June 30, 2024 sunset date to the March 31, 2025 that was proposed in Finance Bill 2024 via amendment to Section 37E of the Tax Procedures Act?

The extension of the Tax Amnesty Programme would be of particular benefit to Kenyans given that according to the National Assembly Finance and Planning Committee as at June 25, 2024, the amnesty programme had mobilised Sh31 billion against the targeted Sh51 billion, translating to a performance rate of just 60.8 percent.

How do we salvage the proposal to increase the quantum of allowable pension deduction from Sh20,000 to Sh30,000 and in so doing provide the much-needed boost for workers disposable incomes even as they create a safety net for their sunset years? This was a very welcome proposal in Finance Bill 2024.

Still on pensions, how do we salvage the proposal to migrate Kenya’s pensions system from exempt-exempt-tax to exempt-exempt-exempt and in so doing, ensure that when senior citizens finally tap into their accrued pension benefits, they are spared the tax that currently comes with it? Not only was this a proposal in Finance Bill 2024, it is a core pillar of the National Pensions Policy.

How do we salvage the proposal to increase the allowable deduction when contributing to a post-retirement medical scheme from Sh10,000 to Sh15,000 and in so doing, make the prospect of preparing for one’s post-retirement medical expenses a lot more attractive?

This was a very important and much needed proposal in Finance Bill 2024. Data from the Retirement Benefits Authority shows that the average lumpsum payment by pension schemes to a retiree in Kenya is Sh1,956,727. And that the most common uses of this lumpsum is paying off loans, medical bills and children’s school fees. That aspect of using one’s pension lumpsum to settle medical bills needs to be addressed in this country.

How do we salvage the proposal to amend the tax free per diem rate from the current Sh2,000 per day to five percent of an employee’s gross monthly income? This proposal was extremely welcome since it was designed to create an incentive to have proper accountability around per diem payments in the country.

Another proposal that was contained in Finance Bill 2024 that ought to be salvaged is the one to increase the amount allowable for deductible purposes when it comes to employees’ non-cash benefits from the present Sh36,000 ceiling to Sh48,000. This proposal was designed to provide more headroom for employees to enjoy non-cash benefits from employers without increasing their taxable income.

How do we salvage the plan to introduce Advance Pricing Agreements between taxpayers and the Kenya Revenue Authority (KRA), and in so doing enhance the certainty with which parties engaged in transfer pricing arrangements are dealing with the taxman?

A tax laws amendment bill is not a strange phenomenon in this country. Kenyans will remember that it was through the Tax Laws Amendment Act No.1 of 2020 that the government undertook Covid-19-related tax measures designed to provide a stimulus for the crisis-hit economy.

It is through the Tax Laws (Amendment) Act No.1 of 2020 that the corporate income tax rate for resident companies was revised downward from 30 percent to 25 percent. It was also this Act that provided much needed reprieve for small businesses when it expanded the ceiling for Turnover Tax eligibility from the initial Sh5 million to Sh50 million as well as reducing the Turnover Tax rate from three percent to one percent.

I believe in the prevailing unprecedented environment, just like it did during the unprecedented Covid-19 environment, a Tax Laws Amendment Bill could be used to unlock these gains for Kenyans.","It is my prayer that among the proposals to be tabled by the Committee upon resumption will be the consideration of a Tax Laws Amendment Bill designed to salvage the progressive proposals that were contained in Finance Bill 2024 yet ended up being a victim of the withdrawal of the Bill in entirety.

It is through the Tax Laws (Amendment) Act No.1 of 2020 that the corporate income tax rate for resident companies was revised downward from 30 percent to 25 percent.
I believe in the prevailing unprecedented environment, just like it did during the unprecedented Covid-19 environment, a Tax Laws Amendment Bill could be used to unlock these gains for Kenyans.","['rate', 'laws', 'amendment', '2024', 'salvage', 'bill', 'proposal', 'pension', 'finance', 'tax']",https://www.businessdailyafrica.com/resource/image/4280368/landscape_ratio3x2/1200/800/5f906745cebf36d1f5831d7060cdae47/PV/bunge.jpg,
Business Daily,https://www.businessdailyafrica.com/bd/opinion-analysis/columnists/cut-red-tape-to-regain-position-as-top-fdi-destination-4675960,2024-07-01,21:00:00 UTC,Cut red tape to regain position as top FDI destination in East Africa,"Kenya, long considered East Africa’s economic powerhouse, finds itself at a crossroads. Recent data from the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development World Investment Report 2024 paints a concerning picture: foreign direct investment (FDI) inflows to Kenya dipped by $93 million (about Sh12 billion) in 2023 to $1.504 billion from $1.597 billion the previous year or 5.85 percent decline.

This is a stark reminder that Kenya’s attractiveness to foreign investors is waning compared to its regional peers.

The primary culprit behind this decline is clear—bureaucratic red tape. Despite significant strides in digital government services, including the lauded eCitizen platform, investors continue to grapple with a labyrinth of regulatory requirements.

The multiplicity of licences and permits required at national and county levels has created a difficult environment for doing business. This bureaucratic morass not only deters new investments but also hampers the expansion plans of existing enterprises.

Kenya’s predicament becomes even more apparent when viewed in the context of its East African neighbours. Ethiopia, once considered a less favourable investment destination, has surged ahead, accounting for a staggering 29.07 percent ($3.26 billion) of the region’s FDI inflows.

Similarly, Uganda, despite its smaller economy, attracted $2.89 billion in FDI, representing a 2.37 percent growth. Even Tanzania, traditionally seen as a less dynamic economy, saw its FDI grow by 5.85 percent to $1.34 billion. These figures underscore a shifting landscape where Kenya’s traditional advantages—strategic location, skilled workforce, and relatively advanced infrastructure—are no longer sufficient to maintain its competitive edge.

The implications of this trend extend far beyond mere statistics. FDI is a crucial driver of growth, bringing not just capital but also technology transfer, expertise, and access to global markets. As Kenya aspires to achieve middle-income status and create jobs, attracting and retaining foreign investors becomes paramount.

President William Ruto’s administration has recognised the potential, identifying renewable energy, housing, manufacturing, agriculture, and ICT as sectors with the greatest potential to attract investors. However, identifying potential is only the first step. The real challenge lies in creating an enabling environment that allows these sectors to flourish and attract the desired investment.","This is a stark reminder that Kenya’s attractiveness to foreign investors is waning compared to its regional peers.

Business Daily,https://www.businessdailyafrica.com/bd/economy/kenya-agoa-exports-dip-42pc-deny-traders-dollar-windfall-4675728,2024-07-01,13:45:00 UTC,"Kenya Agoa exports dip 42pc, deny traders dollar windfall","Kenya’s export earnings to the US under the Africa Growth and Opportunity Act (Agoa) dipped 41.7 percent last year, new data shows, hit by an overall drop in shipments of apparel products and denying traders gains during a period when the shilling had substantially weakened against the dollar.

The Office of the United States Trade Representative (USTR) in a newly published report said that Kenya exported products worth Sh65.77 billion ($510million) to the US under the Agoa scheme in 2023, bucking a growth trend from the previous year when Washington took up goods worth Sh66.88 bllion ($517million) from the country.

“Kenya, Madagascar, and Lesotho were significant suppliers of apparel under Agoa in 2023,” USTR said in its report, noting that overall US apparel imports from all Agoa-legible countries, however, fell to $1.1 billion (Sh141.88 billion) in 2023 from $1.4 billion (Sh180.57 billion) in 2021.

The dip in Agoa fortunes means that Kenyans missed a dollar windfall through 2023 when the shilling plummeted to record levels against the greenback. The shilling hit record low of 160.75 against the dollar in January after bad run throughout 2023—which meant good tidings for exporters paid in dollars.

More than half of Kenyan exports to the US are comprised of clothing, macadamia, coffee, titanium ores and concentrates, and black tea. Three-quarters of US-bound exports benefit from duty-free access to the US under the Agoa.

The Agoa pact, first enacted in 2000 before renewal for 10 years in June 2015, allows duty- and quota-free access to the US for thousands of products like food and beverages, wood, plastics, and rubber from sub-Saharan Africa, but Kenya has largely tapped the apparel line.

The Agoa is due to expire next year with President Joe Biden’s administration keen to extend it. The US Congress has put down proposals that would see Agoa extended to 2041, thus remaining in effect for 16 years.

Senators Chris Coons (Democrat-Delaware) and James Risch (Republican-Idaho) in April this year introduced the bipartisan Agoa Renewal and Improvement Act of 2024, which would see Agoa cover 54 out of the previous 32 African countries.

The extension is expected to integrate Agoa with the African Continental Free Trade Agreement to support the development of intra-African supply chains.

Kenya has long sought a sustainable full free trade agreement with the US outside of the two-decade-old Agoa deal, but progress has been dragged by regime change in both countries.

The two countries are locked in negotiations under the US-Kenya Strategic Trade and Investment Partnership (Stip) whose terms Kenya and the US started stitching together in July 2022 before the end of former President Uhuru Kenyatta’s term in office.

The US, however, maintained that the Stip will not graduate Kenya out of Agoa, which the US trade representative was keen to renew upon expiry mid-2025, subject to approval by lawmakers – the Congress.

The Stip targets wide areas of governance, investment, climate change, agriculture, and trade facilities in areas such as customs procedures.

For example, in agriculture, the US and Kenya negotiating measures to facilitate agricultural trade and enhance transparency besides improving Sanitary and Phytosanitary (SPS) measures.

The two countries are negotiating on fighting graft through information sharing of best practices to prevent and combat bribery and corruption and will explore negotiating specific commitments.","The dip in Agoa fortunes means that Kenyans missed a dollar windfall through 2023 when the shilling plummeted to record levels against the greenback.

EU-Kenya Economic Partnership Agreement (EPA), which preserves unrestricted access of Kenyan goods to the European bloc except for arms, came into force on Monday, Kenya’s Cabinet Secretary for Investment, Trade and Industry Rebecca Miano announced.

“The EU-Kenya EPA is one of the most ambitious agreements negotiated between the European Union and an African country in terms of promoting economic sustainability. It can serve as a template for other African countries, particularly those in Eastern Africa to adapt,” Ms Miano said in a statement.

“The agreement includes trade, economic and development cooperation and a chapter on trade and sustainable development which covers provisions on labour issues, gender equality, forestry and environment and the fight against climate change.”

The pact, the first trade agreement between the EU bloc and a developing country, ensures Kenya’s largely agricultural produce such as vegetables, cut flowers, fruits, tea and coffee continue to enter the bloc duty-and quota-free.

Nairobi, on the other hand, has committed to gradually lower duty on imports from Europe within 25 years after which trade will be liberalised.

This means no duty will apply for goods from Europe such as machinery as well as mineral and chemical products, while investments from the EU will also be incentivised.

The EPA deal, however, has a protectionist clause which bars the EU from applying blanket subsidies to agricultural exports to Kenya in the absence of a deepened policy dialogue with Nairobi. This clause is aimed at safeguarding agriculture and food security in Kenya against unfair competition from the EU.

Trade between the two parties favours the EU, which sold goods worth Sh223.12 billion to Kenya, while importing Sh150.08 billion.

The enforcement of the EU-Kenya EPA comes after approval from the European Parliament on February 29, paving the way for heads of State and government to complete the ratification process.

Some 366 EU lawmakers voted in favour of the deal with 86 members rejecting it, while 56 members abstained.

Kenyan lawmakers also approved the document for it to become enforceable.

The document is largely a modification of the text in the stalled EU-East African Community pact, which was first agreed in October 2014 subject to approval by respective parliaments. The major change is the inclusion of clauses around climate change.

The implementation of the EU-EAC treaty, which Kenya endorsed in 2016, had stalled after the other EAC countries rejected it.

Rwanda signed but did not ratify, while Tanzania and Uganda refused to approve the pact for various economic and political interests, including the fear of European goods flooding the market.

Unlike Kenya, which is a lower middle-income country, the other EAC countries are shielded from higher tariffs on exports under the ""everything but arms"" trade arrangement for least-developed countries.

This is provided for under the World Trade Organisation’s (WTO’s) Special and Differential Treatment (S&D) because they are the least-developed countries (LDCs).

The refusal to cooperate by EAC peers prompted Nairobi to enter into a temporary special arrangement with the EU, which has allowed Kenya’s exports to continue accessing the EU markets duty- and quota-free.

The EAC Heads of State Summit in February 2021, however, allowed partner members to sign bilateral trade deals on condition that they leave room for other EAC countries to join in future.

Kenya and the EU have utilised this window to re-engage on the pact, leaving the door open for other EAC member States to join when they choose to.","Kenya and the European Union have enforced a trade deal after a decade of negotiations, opening up the domestic market for tax-free goods from the 27-country bloc after 25 years.

Business Daily,https://www.businessdailyafrica.com/bd/economy/dar-port-starts-facelift-in-hub-status-fight-against-mombasa--4674792,2024-07-01,03:00:00 UTC,Dar Port starts facelift in hub status fight against Mombasa,"Tanzania’s seaport operations are set for a major overhaul after private investors took over the running of the maritime assets with plans to shore up the efficiency and competitiveness of the Dar es Salaam port in the fight for regional businesses with the port of Mombasa.

The refurbishment of Dar port has seen the number of containers entering the inland container depot (ICD) increase by more than 16 fold to 100 containers in 12 hours from six within the same amount of time, while the number of containers ferried by a single truck in 24 hours to 36 hours has increased from one to six.

“It is beneficial to the port because I can see a lot of competition by the private sector. It is a sign of improvement for the port,” says Emmanuel Mallya, an expert in port issues in Tanzania.

“We are seeing positive prospects for the growth of the port. We used to bring to our ICD six containers for 12 hours. Now for 12 hours we are bringing more than 100.”

Dar Port and Mombasa Port play pivotal roles in the East African maritime trade, serving as primary gateways for international trade, facilitating the smooth flow of goods and functioning as transhipment hubs within the region.

The two ports' efficiency affects regional integration, economic growth and trade.

Port users are already seeing early dividends in the shift to allow private players to run the port at a time when Tanzania is working to attract more cargo to its shores.

According to Mr Mallya, a truck initially used to take between 24 hours to 36 hours to bring one container to the ICD but things are changing and currently one truck brings up to six containers.

“All our inland container yards are now full of containers. We don’t know where to send additional ones,” he says.

Dar port serves countries such as Malawi, Zambia, Eastern DRC, Burundi, Rwanda, Zimbabwe and Uganda while Mombasa caters to Uganda, South Sudan, Northeastern DRC, Burundi, and Rwanda.

Tanzania has handed over the operations and management of its maritime sea assets to Dubai’s DP World and India’s Adani International Ports Holdings (AIPH) for a period of 30 years.

The country hopes to overhaul the performance of its maritime assets and strategically position Dar port to compete effectively with the port of Mombasa.

Mombasa port bypassed its main regional competitors, Djibouti and Dar es Salaam in the latest World Bank global ports index over ship delays and non-tariff barriers.

The Container Port Performance Index (CPPI) 2023, shows that the port of Dar es Salaam dropped 55 places from 312 to 367, blamed on inefficiencies while increasing business bottlenecks in the Djibouti port, a facility touted as the region’s maritime hub, resulted in a drastic drop from position 26 in 2022 to 379 in 2023.

DP World and the Tanzanian government signed a deal in October 2023 for the Emirati logistics company to manage two-thirds of Dar es Salaam port for the next 30 years. Under the deal, DP World will operate and modernise the multi-purpose Dar Port.

DP World will initially invest more than $250 million to upgrade the port and the investment could increase to $1 billion during the concession period, alongside hinterland logistics projects.

The agreement aims to optimise the port’s operations to improve transport and logistics services throughout Tanzania and its hinterland.

Adani has also been granted a 30-year concession to manage Dar es Salaam port’s Container Terminal 2, which includes four berths and has an annual cargo handling capacity of 1 million Twenty-Foot Equivalent Units.

With this development, foreign investors now control eight out of 12 berths at the facility.

Kenya is also considering privatisation initiatives for multiple berths at the Mombasa and Lamu ports.

Last year, the Kenya Port Authority invited investors to express their interest in leasing port infrastructure through public-private partnerships.

Dar Port, handles 90 percent of Tanzania’s trade, clearing $15 billion of merchandise annually.

DP World has begun to enhance the port's efficiency with new equipment and systems, promising significant economic benefits for Tanzania and its neighbouring countries.

Recently, the port witnessed the operation of ship-to-shore cranes for the first time, powered by mega generators moved into the terminal by DP World.

This new infrastructure enabled the completion of the first sulfur vessel in a record four days, marking a historic milestone for the port.

Additionally, the modernisation efforts have allowed the longest vessel ever to dock at the port.","Dar port serves countries such as Malawi, Zambia, Eastern DRC, Burundi, Rwanda, Zimbabwe and Uganda while Mombasa caters to Uganda, South Sudan, Northeastern DRC, Burundi, and Rwanda.

Business Daily,https://www.businessdailyafrica.com/bd/economy/how-kenya-paid-sh197bn-interest-on-debut-eurobond--4675074,2024-07-01,03:00:00 UTC,How Kenya paid Sh197bn interest on debut Eurobond,"Kenyan taxpayers paid $1.53 billion (Sh197.4 billion) in interest on the 2014 Eurobond whose last instalment was repaid last Friday, underlining the heavy cost of reliance on commercial debt to fund the budget.

The interest paid is the equivalent of 55.6 percent of the $2.75 billion (Sh354 billion in Monday’s rate) that the Treasury borrowed in the debut sovereign bond in June 2014.

This bond was sold in two tranches of five and 10 years, split at $750 million (Sh96.5 billion) and $2 billion (Sh257.4 billion) and paying interest at rates of 5.875 percent and 6.875 percent respectively.

Eurobonds attract a fixed rate of interest during the life of the loan, and the principal is repaid in a bullet payment upon maturity, rather than on a reducing balance basis.

This is unlike the concessional loans whose principal amount is paid down progressively alongside interest, sparing the borrower having to pay high interest throughout the life of a loan.

Eurobond loans also pose a repayment problem upon maturity as the borrower is required to settle the principal in one go, causing foreign currency liquidity pressure on the exchequer.

For the five-year bond—which the government repaid in June 2019—the interest charge totalled $214.2 million (Sh27.6 billion). On the 10-year paper, the total interest amounted to $1.32 billion (Sh169.8 billion), owing to its higher quantum and longer tenor.

The 10-year bond was partially repaid ahead of time in February through a buyback that was financed by a new Eurobond sale. The buyback saw the State retire $1.44 billion worth of notes early, with the balance being repaid last Friday using the proceeds of a $1.2 billion loan contracted from the World Bank.

“Payment was settled on June 21. Bondholders have received their due (and) the matter is behind us,” Public Debt Management Office director-general Haron Sirima said.

At the time of issuance, the debut Eurobond was seen as a relatively cheap option for development financing owing to the prevailing low international interest rates, and therefore an alternative for domestic borrowing in order to reduce competition for credit with the private sector.

The government identified a number of infrastructure projects in agriculture, transport and energy for funding using the proceeds of the bond, although subsequent audits did not show direct allocation to the projects as had been planned.

In the energy sector, the Treasury indicated that the money would go to expanding transmission lines, and exploration and drilling of geothermal wells.

In the transport sector, the Treasury identified the dredging of the Lamu Port, which was in its initial stages of development at the time, and an urban commuter rail linking the Nairobi city centre the Jomo Kenyatta International Airport as priorities for fund allocation.

In agriculture, funding was earmarked for the Galana-Kulalu irrigation project. These projects were supposed to generate income to help service the loan, according to the initial plans by the government.

A special audit done in 2019 by the Office of the Auditor-General, however, found that the funds were likely put into general budgetary use by ministries after being transferred to the exchequer account.

This made it difficult to identify whether the proceeds of the bond were put into the specific projects that had been earmarked for funding.

Subsequent Eurobond sales have tended to go towards general funding of the budget, or repaying other maturing debt.

In February 2018, part of the proceeds of the second Eurobond sale, which raised Sh202 billion, was used to retire syndicated loans contracted in 2015 and 2017.","Kenyan taxpayers paid $1.53 billion (Sh197.4 billion) in interest on the 2014 Eurobond whose last instalment was repaid last Friday, underlining the heavy cost of reliance on commercial debt to fund the budget.

Official estimates showed that the items listed as non-essential for the President’s office total Sh667 million— putting the focus on the size of chops that would be effected to justify his austerity promise while avoiding inconvenience to his day-to-day activities.

Cuts to travel expenditure may see Dr Ruto reduce local and foreign trips, while the planned refurbishment of his office in Nairobi’s Central Business District and the modernisation of the government printing press could also be halted in the rationalisation plan.

The pronouncement by the President proposing cuts to his office budget was forced upon by days of deadly protests in which the public demanded an end to wasteful and frivolous spending by the State amidst lean times caused by high debt levels.

The proposed cuts to spending by the Executive Office of the President are expected to precede further reductions in spending plans with President Ruto directing the National Treasury to pursue additional austerity measures to cut non-essential spending by Parliament, the Judiciary, and county governments.

“I direct immediate further austerity measures extending to the entire Executive arm of government. I direct that operational expenditure in the Presidency be reduced to remove allocations for the confidential vote, reduce travel budget, hospitality and purchase of motor vehicles, renovations, and other expenditures,” President Ruto said.

The listed spending areas had an allocation of Sh667 million for the financial year starting today, according to data from the National Treasury budget books.

Spending on domestic and foreign travel had been estimated at Sh10.4 million and Sh7.5 million respectively, a higher allocation compared to the Sh5.2 million and Sh7.2 million programmed in the budget ended June 30. The hospitality supplies and services budget was however lower at Sh84.7 million in contrast to Sh144.1 million previously.

The purchase of vehicles and other transport equipment for the Executive Office of the President would have however gobbled up Sh50 million from Sh27.3 million previously.

Other recurrent spending areas for the office cover printing, advertising, and information supplies and services; training expenses, purchase of fuel and lubricants, purchase of office furniture and the routine maintenance of vehicles and other transport equipment.

Proposed cuts to development spending by the office cover the refurbishment of buildings at Harambee House which hosts the Executive Office of the President and the modernisation of the press and refurbishment of buildings at the government printer which sits on Haile Selassie Avenue in the capital city.

The budget to refurbish the President's office in Nairobi CBD was set at Sh14.3 million while the upgrade of the government printer would cost Sh500 million.

The total budget to the Executive Office of the President had been set at Sh5.3 billion for the year to June 2025.

President William Ruto can implement the desired changes to the Sh3.92 trillion budget through the 1st supplementary estimates for the 2024/25 financial year having signed the 2024 Appropriations Bill into law on Friday as passed by MPs.

The President indicated that the supplementary budget would achieve cuts of Sh346 billion covering the hole resulting from the withdrawal of the 2024 Finance Bill.

The initial Sh3.92 trillion budget included Sh2.78 trillion in recurrent spending, Sh687.9 billion in development spending, Sh446.1 billion in transfers to counties including equitable share, Sh43.6 billion to Parliament, and Sh23.6 billion to the Judiciary.

The National Treasury expected to fund the budget through Sh3.3 trillion in total revenue collections including Sh2.91 trillion in taxes, leaving behind a balance of Sh597 billion to be plugged by Sh33.8 billion in external financing and Sh263.2 billion in domestic borrowing.","President William Ruto faces public scrutiny and delicate juggling over his pledge to cut non-essential expenditures in his office, including travel, hospitality, and the purchase of motor vehicles to curb the wastage of funds.

The dictionary continues to explain that the term gaslighting originated from the title of a 1938 play and the movies based on that play, the plots of which involve a man attempting to make his wife believe that she is going insane. His mysterious activities in the attic cause the house’s gas lights to dim, but he insists to his wife that the lights are not dimming and that she can’t trust her own perceptions.

I ended my column last Monday by saying that following the Gen Z protests the previous week, corporate leaders need Gen Z mentors to help them get a real-time understanding of their current and future customers. Then things became hotter last Tuesday and Thursday.

Gas flame hot. Conversations on various social media platforms became emotive, passionate and even incendiary. Two debates on two different groups that I am a member of stood out for me. The first, a neighbourhood group, had two Members of Parliament (MPs) who voted yes and were specifically called out for this. One MP hugged a mute tree and remained as silent as a Manchester United fan at a Premier League Recent Winner’s Whatsapp group as the group chatter went on and on about how tone-deaf the political class were choosing to be against their constituents.

The second MP chose to leap off the self-incriminating cliff with defensive clapbacks on why they voted yes, once a video of them speaking in Parliament supporting the controversial Finance Bill was posted on the group. This MP thumped their chest and said they had nothing to apologise for. The abuses that followed sent the second MP to join the first one sitting under the Old Trafford mute tree.

The second debate was on a different group of professional colleagues. Amongst them is a senior public servant who chose to come in and throw a grenade. Rather than reading the room where there was also much discussion about the reason behind the tax protests, the individual chose to paint a picture of chaos, fear and despondency if the protests, which by this time had started having violent outcomes, didn’t end.

The individual did not for a single minute explain the rationale behind the Finance Bill. Not a single minute. Consequently, many of the other group members called the individual out, asking them to remove the rose-tinted glasses and red carpet-lined blinkers that were blocking them from seeing what the mood of the nation was. Following the withdrawal of the Finance Bill later that day, nothing has been heard from the individual who likely joined the other MPs sitting under the Old Trafford mute tree.

Legislators post dancing videos on Tiktok, swaying their hips with shiny faces lifted to the Range Rover heavens, thanking their Lexus gods for the far they have come.

When called out for the exuberance of their instant coffee wealth, they rubbish the naysayers and call them jealous.

Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of business, the financial markets and the world economy.

Sales at Sainsbury’s have slowed despite a 25% jump in people buying TVs during Euro 2024, partly because of a big drop in sales at its Argos chain.

Food inflation has eased, and the supermarket group battled a “tough trading backdrop” on clothing and general merchandise amid poor weather and the cost of living crisis.

Like-for-like sales (at stores open at least a year), excluding fuel, slowed to 2.7% in the 16 weeks to 22 June, from 4.8% in the previous quarter.

Food sales growth eased to 4.8% from 7.3% as inflation across the market eased.

Argos sales plunged by 6.2% in the latest quarter, because people bought less garden furniture, paddling pools and other seasonal products than last year due to cold and wet weather. Sales electronics such as video games were also weak.

Sainsbury’s said:

Consumers continue to shop general merchandise more cautiously but respond to value. More positive signs are coming through now in general merchandise with the better weather and the Summer of Sport ramping up.

As the warm weather hit last week, people immediately stocked up on cooling and garden products. Sainsbury’s said it sold more fans in one week than it had in the year to date. Thanks to the euros, TV sales have surged, as fans upgraded to better sets ahead of the big matches.

The supermarket chain stuck to its forecast of a retail underlying operating profit of between £1.01bn and £1.06bn this year, up between 5% and 10% from last year.

Later this morning, we’ll be getting ‘flash’ inflation figures for June from the eurozone.

Inflation in the 20-nation eurozone is expected to have fallen slightly, to 2.5% from 2.6% in May.

Eurostat, the European Commission’s office, will release the data at 10am BST. The core rate, which excludes volatile items like food and energy, is forecast to have eased to 2.8% from 2.9%.

The Guardian,https://www.theguardian.com/money/article/2024/jul/02/next-uk-government-poised-to-benefit-from-fall-in-inflation-and-fuel-prices,2024-07-01,23:01:27 UTC,Next UK government poised to benefit from fall in inflation and fuel prices,"Britain’s next government is poised to benefit from easing pressure on household finances after a slowdown in inflation in stores and a fall in fuel prices, but costs remain “too expensive” for many families.

Figures from the British Retail Consortium (BRC) show that annual UK shop price inflation cooled last month to 0.2%, down from 0.6% in May – the slowest pace since October 2021 – as retailers cut the prices of many of their key products, including butter and coffee.

Coming before Thursday’s general election, separate figures from the RAC show that petrol and diesel prices fell for a second straight month in June to ease pressure on families affected by the cost of living crisis. The organisation said, however, that filling up on the forecourt was still “too expensive” in England, Wales and Scotland.

According to the RAC’s monthly fuel watch, the average price of petrol in the UK at the end of June was just under 145p a litre, down from 148p at the start of the month. Diesel dropped from nearly 154p to about 150p.

“Fuel prices are still nowhere near where they should be despite falling for the second consecutive month,” the RAC said. It highlighted the lower cost of filling up in Northern Ireland, where petrol is 4.5p a litre cheaper on average and diesel 8p cheaper than in the rest of the UK.

The RAC’s head of policy, Simon Williams, said: “While it’s good news prices at the pumps have fallen for the second month in a row, this also leaves a bad taste in the mouth because we know drivers in Great Britain are continuing to get a raw deal as both petrol and diesel are still much more expensive than in Northern Ireland.”

He said prices at forecourts owned and run by Shell and BP were the most expensive, highlighting Competition and Markets Authority data showing that Shell-owned sites were the most expensive in the UK.

“We remain baffled how the very same fuel can be sold for such vastly different prices by the biggest retailers, whether they’re run by supermarkets or the world’s largest oil companies,” he said.

Rishi Sunak has made lower inflation the cornerstone of the Conservatives’ general election campaign after a return in the official headline rate to the Bank of England’s target of 2% in May, down from a peak of 11.1% in October 2022.

The shadow chancellor, Rachel Reeves, however, has said pressure on household finances remains “acute” as average prices remain significantly higher than before the cost of living crisis took hold.

According to the latest snapshot from the BRC, food inflation slowed to 2.5% in June, down from 3.2% in May, in the 14th consecutive deceleration for annual growth in grocery prices. The figures suggest average prices in UK shops are continuing to rise, albeit at a slower pace than in previous months.

The chief executive of the BRC, Helen Dickinson, said retailers had, however, cut the prices of some key products including butter and coffee. Non-food prices were also in deflation – meaning average prices are falling compared with a year earlier – as shops tried to boost their sales by discounting products.

“This was particularly true for TVs with great deals to capitalise on the Euros fever,” she said. “Whoever wins Thursday’s election will benefit from the work of retailers to cut their costs and prices, easing the cost of living for millions of households.”","Britain’s next government is poised to benefit from easing pressure on household finances after a slowdown in inflation in stores and a fall in fuel prices, but costs remain “too expensive” for many families.

The Guardian,https://www.theguardian.com/technology/article/2024/jul/02/can-ai-boom-drive-nvidia-to-a-4tn-valuation-despite-investor-doubt,2024-07-02,05:00:35 UTC,Can AI boom drive Nvidia to a $4tn valuation despite investor doubt?,"When Jensen Huang spoke at the Nvidia annual general meeting last week, he made no mention of a share price slide.

The US chipmaker, buoyed up by its key role in the artificial intelligence boom, had briefly become the world’s most valuable company on 18 June but the crown slipped quickly. Nvidia shed about $550bn (£434bn) from the $3.4tn (£2.68tn) peak market value it had reached that week, as tech investors, combining profit-taking with doubts about the sustainability of its rocketing growth, applied the brakes.

Huang, however, spoke like the CEO of a business that took 30 days this year to go from a valuation of $2tn to $3tn – and sees $4tn coming into view.

He described a forthcoming group of powerful new chips, called Blackwell, as potentially “the most successful product in our history” and perhaps in the entire history of the computer. He added that the new wave for AI would be automating $50tn of heavy industry, and described what sounded like an endless loop of robotic factories orchestrating robots that “build products that are robotic”.

Wrapping up, he said: “We’ve reinvented Nvidia, the computer industry and very likely the world.”

These are the kinds of words on which a $4tn valuation, and the AI hype cycle, are built. Nvidia shares are inching back, returning above $3tn this week, because it remains the best way to buy shares in the AI boom. Is that enough to propel it to $4tn despite the emergence of investor doubt?

Alvin Nguyen, a senior analyst at the research company Forrester, said “only a collapse of the genAI market” would prevent Nvidia from reaching $4tn at some point – but whether it got there first ahead of tech rivals was another matter. Currently, Microsoft – another big player in AI – and Apple are first and second respectively in terms of market size, with Nvidia third.

If OpenAI’s next big AI model, GPT-5, and other new models were astonishing, the share price would stay buoyant and could get to $4tn by the end of 2025, said Nguyen. But if they underwhelmed, then the share price could be affected, given its status as a flag-carrier for the technology. A technological breakthrough could result in less computing power being needed to train models, he added, or interest from businesses and consumers in generative AI tools could be less robust than hoped.

“There is a lot that is unknown and out of Nvidia’s control that could impact their path to $4tn,” said Nguyen. “Such as disappointment with new models that come out, model improvements that reduce the computational needs, and weaker than expected demand from enterprises and consumers for genAI products.”

Private AI research labs such as OpenAI and Anthropic – the entities behind the ChatGPT and Claude chatbots – aren’t traded on public markets, leaving vast sums of money floating around in investor accounts with no way to access some of the big hitters in the generative AI frenzy.

Buying shares in multinationals such as Microsoft or Google is already expensive, and only a fraction of an investment is related to the hot new thing. There could be a vast AI boom but if, for example, Google’s search ads business faltered as a result, then the company wouldn’t necessarily be a net winner.

Nvidia, by contrast, is selling spades in a gold rush. Despite years of investment in capacity, it continues to sell its top-end chips faster than it can make them. Huge proportions of the investments in frontier AI research flow straight out of the labs and into Nvidia’s coffers, with companies such as Meta committing billions of dollars of spend to secure hundreds of thousands of Nvidia’s GPUs (graphics processing units).

That type of chip, the company’s specialty, was once sold to enable gamers to experience crisp and smooth graphics in 3D games – and through a monumental stroke of good luck, turned out to be exactly what cutting-edge researchers needed to build massive AI systems such as GPT-4 or Claude 3.5.

GPUs are able to carry out, at great volume and speed, the complicated calculations that underpin the training and operation of AI tools such as chatbots. So any company wanting to build or operate a generative AI product, such as ChatGPT or Google’s Gemini, needs GPUs. The same goes for deployment of freely available AI models such as Meta’s Llama, which also requires vast amounts of chips as part of its training phase. In the case of systems known as large language models (LLMs), training involves crunching through huge blocks of data. This teaches the LLM to recognise patterns in language and gauge what should be the next word or sentence in response to a chatbot query.

Nvidia has never quite cornered the AI chip market, though. Google has always relied on its own chips, which it calls TPUs (for “tensor”, a feature of an AI model), and others want to join it. Meta has developed its Meta Training and Inference Accelerator, Amazon offers its Trainium2 chips to companies using AWS (Amazon Web Services), and Intel has produced the Gaudi 3.

None of the big rivals compete with Nvidia – yet – at the absolute top end. But that’s not the only place where competition is happening. A report from the Information, a tech news site, highlighted the rise of “batch processing”, offering businesses cheaper access to AI models if they’re OK with waiting for their queries to be run at periods of low demand. That, in turn, allows providers such as OpenAI to buy cheaper, more efficient chips for their datacentres rather than focus all their spending on the fastest possible hardware.

At the other end, smaller businesses are starting to offer increasingly specialised products that beat what Nvidia can provide in a head-to-head race. Groq (not to be confused with Elon Musk’s similarly named Grok AI, the launch of which sparked an ongoing trademark dispute) makes chips which can’t be used to train AI at all – but which run the resulting models blazingly fast. Not to be outdone, the startup Etched, which has just raised $120m, is building a chip that only runs one type of AI model: a “transformer”, the T in GPT (generative pre-trained transformer).

Nvidia doesn’t just need to hold its own in the face of competition, big and small. To hit the next milestone, it needs to thrive. Market fundamentals are out of fashion, but if the company were valued like a traditional, low-growth enterprise, even a $3tn market cap would require it to sell a trillion of its top-end GPUs a year, at a 30% profit margin, forever, one expert noted.

Even if the AI industry grows enough to justify that, Nvidia’s own profit margin may be harder to defend. The company has the chip designs to hold the lead, but the real bottlenecks in its supply chain are the same as for much of the rest of the industry: at the advanced semiconductor foundries, of the sort operated by Taiwan’s TSMC, America’s Intel, China’s SMIC and precious few others around the world. Notably not on that list is Nvidia itself, which is a customer of TSMC. No matter how advanced Nvidia’s chipsets are, if it needs to eat into the rest of TSMC’s order book to match demand, then the profit will inevitably flow that way too.

Neil Wilson, the chief analyst at the brokerage firm Finalto, said the bear case against Nvidia – market jargon for a sustained fall in share price – rested on the argument that once the company worked through its order book, it would go back to less frenetic levels of demand.

“All their customers have been rushing to order the GPUs but they won’t be doing that forever,” said Wilson. “Customers over-order and then start cancelling. It’s a sweet spot now but it cannot be sustained.” He could see Nvidia getting to $4tn and beyond, but “maybe not at the current pace”.

Jim Reid, Deutsche Bank’s head of global economics and thematic research, published a note this week asking if Nvidia was “the fastest growing large company of all time?” Pointing out that Nvidia went from $2tn to $3tn in 30 days, Reid said conversely, it had taken Warren Buffett 60 years to get Berkshire Hathaway close to $1tn.

Nonetheless, in a world of low productivity – a measure of economic efficiency – and declining working age populations and rising government debts, the economic promise of AI was welcome, said Reid.

“If AI is the catalyst for a fourth Industrial Revolution, that would be very good news,” he wrote. “If not then markets will ultimately have a big problem.”

More is at stake than winning a race to $4tn.","Nvidia shares are inching back, returning above $3tn this week, because it remains the best way to buy shares in the AI boom.

Members of the union were scheduled to begin industrial action on 8 July, days after Indian-owned Tata began a wind-down process that will ultimately end more than 70 years of making steel from scratch at the plant.

On Monday, however, Unite confirmed it had cancelled its strike plans after Rajesh Nair, the UK boss of Tata Steel, wrote to unions over the weekend to offer a further round of discussions about future investments at the south Wales site.

Unite said Tata had confirmed that “it was now prepared to enter into negotiations about future investment for its operations and not just redundancies”.

The union’s general secretary, Sharon Graham, said: “This is a significant development in the battle to protect jobs and the long-term future of steelmaking in south Wales. Investment from Labour secured by Unite will be key to the future of the site.

“This breakthrough would not have come about without the courage of our members at Port Talbot who were prepared to stand up and fight for their jobs. Workers were simply not prepared to stand idly by while steelmaking ended and their communities were laid to waste.

“It is essential that these talks progress swiftly and in good faith with the focus on fresh investment and ensuring the long-term continuation of steelmaking in south Wales.”

Tata Steel had originally planned to begin shutting down Port Talbot’s blast furnace No 5 this week, with No 4 slated for closure in September.

It brought forward the second half of the plan to this week in response to Unite calling the strike, saying it could not operate the site safely without enough workers.

On Monday, however, Tata Steel said it had received written confirmation that industrial action would not go ahead.

A spokesperson said: “As a result, and given we can now be confident of ensuring appropriate resourcing of activities to operate safely, we will halt preparations for the early cessation of operations on blast furnace 4 and the wider heavy end in Port Talbot, planned for this week. We welcome the fact that we have avoided having to progress down this path.

“The resumption of discussions with the UK Steel Committee [which represents the Community, Unite and the GMB unions] will progress from the position reached in the last meeting of 22 May and will focus on the future investments and aspirations for the business, and not on a renegotiation of our existing plan for the heavy-end closure or the enhanced employment support terms.

“The wind-down process for blast furnace 5 has now begun to plan and we expect to produce the final iron at the end of this week.”

Community, which represents more steelworkers than Unite and has often disagreed with its sister union over how to protect Port Talbot workers, welcomed the decision.

“Tata confirmed that if the strike was called off they are ready to resume discussions on a potential [memorandum of understanding], through the multi-union steel committee, which is chaired by Community,” said Alun Davies, a national officer for the organisation.

“The truth is Tata never walked away from those discussions, and at our last meeting on 22 May all unions agreed to conclude the negotiations and put the outcome to our members. Community will welcome resuming those discussions, but we regret that zero progress has been made since 22 May.

“With thousands of jobs at stake, we welcome Unite’s decision to withdraw their strike action and get back around the table with their sister steel unions.”

The Guardian,https://www.theguardian.com/business/article/2024/jul/01/thames-water-accused-of-chicanery-over-150m-dividend-payment,2024-07-01,14:46:02 UTC,Thames Water accused of ‘chicanery’ over £150m dividend payment,"Thames Water has been urged to show greater transparency over its finances and accused of “financial chicanery” after it emerged its board had approved a £150m dividend hours before its shareholders U-turned on providing emergency funding.

The Guardian revealed last week that the board of the struggling water supplier agreed to the payout at a meeting on 27 March.

The following day, the debt-laden company said its investors were no longer willing to provide £500m of funding they had previously pledged, raising the prospect that the company may be temporarily nationalised. Thames Water made no mention of the dividend payment at that point.

The water industry regulator, Ofwat, planned to investigate the circumstances around the dividend paid by Thames, sources said. The company was already under investigation over its decision to pay a separate £37.5m dividend at the time the £150m dividend was paid.

Britain’s biggest water supplier said the payment was made from the regulated company to an intermediate parent company, Kemble Water Eurobond, to “settle a pension top-up payment” and “surrender relief” on tax losses.

Gary Carter, GMB national officer, said: “Thames Water has once again shown an alarming lack of transparency.

“Of course GMB wants our members’ pension pots to get back in the black – but shareholders should be topping it up.

“Instead they’re taking money out of the regulated company, money needed to stop spills and pay our members’ wages.”

He added: “Thames Water needs to front up about its financial chicanery, while shareholders need to cough up to fill the pensions black hole – not customers or taxpayers.”

The Liberal Democrat Treasury spokesperson Sarah Olney, who has called for Thames Water to be put into special administration by the government and for it to be reformed as a public benefit company, said: “This is a scandalous payout while our rivers are polluted with sewage and the company stands on the brink of bankruptcy.

“It is concrete evidence of why we need to abolish Ofwat and create a new water regulator with real teeth and power.

“The public will never forgive the Conservative party for how they have let water firms get away with financial mismanagement and environmental vandalism.”

Adrian Ramsay, co-leader of the Green party of England and Wales, said: “The further revelations about Thames Water further prove that the experiment of a privatised water system has fundamentally failed.

“At a time when our rivers are choked with sewage and water pipes are at bursting point, it’s unconscionable that water companies continue to prioritise payouts over their responsibilities to the public and the environment.”

The campaigner and former Undertones singer Feargal Sharkey said: “The dividend illustrates yet again the utter contempt and disdain that the water industry treats regulators and the politicians that oversee it with.

“Ofwat seems to have no ability to control them. There is an arrogance and contempt towards customers and regulators – that’s what happens when you have a company operating a monopoly with no proper oversight.”

The £150m did not reach external Thames shareholders but did leave the ringfenced portion of the group’s complex corporate structure. Ofwat has been clamping down on the flow of cash from ringfenced water companies to holding companies, amid concerns that payouts are weakening the finances of regulated water companies.

Ofwat is due to publish its draft response to water firms’ five-year business plans on 11 July. Thames’s annual results need to be published by 15 July.

The Guardian,https://www.theguardian.com/technology/article/2024/jul/01/meta-facebook-instagram-eu-digital-markets-act,2024-07-01,12:05:04 UTC,"Meta breaches digital law by charging for ad-free social networks, EU says","Mark Zuckerberg’s Meta has breached the EU’s new digital laws with an advertising model that charges users for ad-free versions of Facebook and Instagram, according to the European Commission.

Meta launched a “pay or consent” model last year in an effort to comply with the bloc’s data privacy rules, under which users pay a monthly fee for an ad-free version of Facebook or Instagram that does not use their personal data for advertising purposes. Users who do not pay consent, as part of the signing up process for the platforms, to their data being used to tailor personalised adverts that appear in their social media feeds.

The European Commission, the EU’s executive body, said the model did not comply with the Digital Markets Act (DMA), which is designed to rein in big tech companies. The commission issued preliminary findings from an investigation into “pay or consent” on Monday and found the model “forces users to consent” to their data being collected from multiple platforms. It also does not allow users to choose a service that uses less of their data but is broadly similar to the “with adverts” versions of Facebook and Instagram, the commission said.

“In the commission’s preliminary view, this binary choice forces users to consent to the combination of their personal data and fails to provide them a less personalised but equivalent version of Meta’s social networks,” it said.

It said in order to comply with the DMA, Meta must launch “equivalent” versions of Facebook and Instagram that use less of people’s data.

A Meta spokesperson said the new model had been designed to comply the DMA and other regulatory demands.

“Subscriptions as an alternative to advertising are a well-established business model across many industries, and we designed subscription for no ads to address several overlapping regulatory obligations, including the DMA. We will continue to engage constructively with the commission,” they said.

The Guardian,https://www.theguardian.com/business/article/2024/jul/01/french-markets-marine-le-pen-euro-dollar,2024-07-01,12:21:48 UTC,French market leaps amid hopes Le Pen will fall short of outright victory,"Shares on the French stock market have risen after the first round of voting in the country’s parliamentary election eased concerns about an outright victory for the rightwing National Rally (RN) party.

The euro rose against the dollar, while the risk premium investors demand for holding French government bonds fell as the markets took the view that the result could have been worse.

But despite a 1.5% jump in France’s benchmark stock market measure – the Cac 40 – on Monday, shares have fallen 5% in the past month amid fears that Marine Le Pen’s RN could still emerge from next Sunday’s second round of voting with an overall majority.

RN secured 33% of the vote, while the leftwing New Popular Front secured 28% and Emmanuel Macron’s centrist bloc won the support of 20% of those who voted.

Alex Everett, an investment manager at the fund management company abrdn, said: “We are not out of the woods yet. The National Rally exceeded expectations and may yet pick up the second-round votes for a relative or even absolute majority.

“Intense horse trading until Tuesday evening will likely see deals cut between the left and centre parties to try to derail this.”

On Friday, the gap between the interest rate (yield) on French and German bonds had widened to its highest since the eurozone debt crisis in 2012, but the spread narrowed slightly from 0.85 percentage points to 0.75 points after the results came in. The gap was less than 0.5 points before the snap election was called.

Krishna Guha, an analyst at the US investment bank Evercore, said: “The vote is far from definitive but leans in favour of the less bad scenario of a hung parliament, political paralysis in Paris and chronic dysfunction at the EU level rather than the worse scenarios of an outright win for the far right or far left that might directly lead to a new European sovereign crisis.”

The Guardian,https://www.theguardian.com/business/article/2024/jul/01/boeing-to-buy-supplier-spirit-aerosystems-deal,2024-07-01,08:11:32 UTC,Boeing to buy supplier Spirit AeroSystems in $4.7bn deal,"Boeing has agreed a $4.7bn (£3.7bn) deal to buy the parts supplier it sold nearly 20 years ago, as it seeks to improve safety on its production lines after a panel blew off an Alaska Airlines-operated plane mid-flight earlier this year.

The under-pressure US planemaker will buy Spirit Aerosystems, which supplies it with fuselage and wing parts, as it attempts to improve safety and quality in its manufacturing processes.

Talks to buy back Spirit began just weeks after a door panel blew out in mid-air on one of Boeing’s 737 Max 9s in January, shortly after it took off from Portland, Oregon.

Investigations by the US safety regulator later discovered the panel appeared to be missing four key bolts. The National Transportation Safety Board said the four bolts were removed while workers repaired damaged rivets last year at Boeing’s facility in Renton, Washington.

The deal to bring Spirit back in house marks a shift away from Boeing outsourcing key components for its planes. Spirit was spun off from Boeing in 2005 but it still accounts for about 70% of all of its orders, with roughly 25% coming from Airbus – Boeing’s arch-rival.

The Boeing president and chief executive, Dave Calhoun, said: “By reintegrating Spirit, we can fully align our commercial production systems, including our safety and quality management systems, and our workforce to the same priorities, incentives and outcomes – centred on safety and quality.”

Airbus will take over the part of Spirit’s business in Northern Ireland that makes wings and fuselage for its A220 jet. Spirit is one of Northern Ireland’s largest manufacturing employers, with about 3,500 staff across the country.

About 40% of Spirit jobs in Northern Ireland are linked to production for companies including Bombardier and Rolls-Royce, and Airbus has said it will aim to sell some of these parts.

Boeing will pay Airbus $559m in compensation to take over operations at four of its plants, including the plant in Belfast.

The total transaction value is about $8.3bn when Spirit’s net debt is included, Boeing said. Spirit shareholders will receive $37.50 a share as part of the deal.

It was revealed on Sunday that the US Department of Justice is poised to charge Boeing with fraud. However, plans to offer the planemaker a plea deal – according to sources familiar with the matter – have infuriated the loved ones of hundreds of passengers who died in two fatal crashes five years ago.

Boeing will be granted until the end of this week to decide whether it will plead guilty to the charge and avoid trial, officials told families of those onboard the fatal Lion Air flight 610 and Ethiopian Airlines flight 302, which claimed 346 lives.

Attorneys representing the relatives accused the federal government of cooking up “another sweetheart plea deal” with Boeing.","Boeing has agreed a $4.7bn (£3.7bn) deal to buy the parts supplier it sold nearly 20 years ago, as it seeks to improve safety on its production lines after a panel blew off an Alaska Airlines-operated plane mid-flight earlier this year.

Britain’s largest building society said prices had risen slightly in June amid the impact of higher mortgage costs, with a 0.2% month-on-month increase.

On an annual basis house price growth accelerated from 1.3% in May to 1.5% in June, leaving prices about 3% below the record high set in summer 2022. The average price of a UK home was £266,064 in June, Nationwide said.

House prices in the UK fell last year as households came under pressure from 14 consecutive interest rate rises from the Bank of England, but they remain at historically high levels relative to earnings. Prices returned to growth earlier this year, but activity has been constrained by persistently higher borrowing costs and prices remaining unaffordable for many households.

Robert Gardner, the Nationwide chief economist, said mortgage rates were still well above the record lows of 2021 and that rising costs had outstripped the benefit from stronger levels of average pay growth in recent months.

“As a result, housing affordability is still stretched. Today, a borrower earning the average UK income buying a typical first-time buyer property with a 20% deposit would have a monthly mortgage payment equivalent to 37% of take-home pay – well above the long run average of 30%,” he said.

Separate figures from the Bank of England revealed a slowdown in housing market activity in May as people borrowed £1.2bn of mortgage debt, down from £2.2bn in April. Net mortgage approvals for house purchases also fell slightly from 60,800 in April to 60,000 in May.

Official figures show average annual wage growth in the three months to April was 6%, above the rate of inflation, which fell back to the Bank’s target of 2% in May after reaching a peak of 11% in October 2022, the highest level in four decades.

The figures come as Labour and the Conservatives promise to boost housing affordability in their manifestos for Thursday’s general election, including pledges to build millions of new homes and support households with raising deposits and accessing cheaper mortgages.

Since 2010, despite a succession of government pledges, the average age of a first-time buyer in the UK has risen, rents have soared, homelessness has more than doubled and housebuilding targets have been missed.","House prices in the UK remain unaffordable for many households despite wages rising above inflation for the typical earner, Nationwide has said.

A study released by abrdn Financial Fairness Trust, a research body set up by the fund manager, said the public are willing to support policies that they don’t think will benefit their own finances, despite almost two in five (39%) of households now classed as having serious financial difficulties. The number of households with finances in distress has increased by 2.9 million since the last election in 2019, when 28% were in that situation.

About a third of the 5,572 people surveyed said they supported raising their taxes if it benefitted other people with more hours of free childcare, cheaper energy tariffs for lower-income households and an increase in child benefit.

Mubin Haq, the trust’s chief executive, said: “People realise in terms of what the parties are promising on public services that there is a massive gap on what’s needed and what money is available. That is why the public backs these tax rises, because they would rather have that than even more deterioration of public services.”

Both parties have ruled out tax rises for income tax and VAT, while the Conservatives have said they would knock 2p off national insurance contributions, cut stamp duty and give a tax break to pensioners.

In June, the Guardian reported that the Labour party has been drawing up options to raise money to rebuild public services with extra wealth taxes.

The next government will have to implement further cuts of between £10bn and £20bn on unprotected Whitehall departments if it wants to reduce debt and avoid raising taxes, according to the Institute for Fiscal Studies (IFS).

However, the head of the IFS, Paul Johnson, said a Labour government would raise taxes or soften debt rules before it embarked on another round of cuts. Johnson said the pressures on public spending were so powerful that he could not envisage a Labour chancellor making cuts to balance the books.

The Aim-listed company, which owns the shipyard where the Titanic was built, said on Monday that it would suspend trading with immediate effect because accounts had not been filed.

It expects to publish the accounts in the week commencing 8 July, with share trading resuming at that point.

The Belfast-based shipbuilder was plunged into uncertainty last month when it was reported that the UK government was witholding the approval of a £200m loan guarantee promised in December to shore up its finances.

The update on Monday said that because of the “multi-year and complex nature” of some of its contracts, it had been in “extensive discussions” with auditors over how best to record revenues over the duration of a build programme.

It said that this was particularly relevant when assessing incomes from its seven-year contract with the Spanish shipbuilder Navantia to assist in the construction of fleet support ships for the Royal Navy, a deal that is expected to net the UK company £750m.

It added: “The assessment of the split in revenues between current year’s revenues and deferred revenues has caused a delay to the audit process and hence the publication of the company’s annual report and audited financial statements.”

The company was able to publish unaudited accounts in which it posted an operating loss of £24.7m for the 12 months until 31 December 2023, an improvement on a £58.5m loss a year earlier. Revenues increased from £27.8m in 2022, to £86.9m this year.

In May, the GMB union wrote to the chancellor warning that any decision to block the £200m loan guarantee that had been offered to Harland & Wolff would put jobs at threat.

The letter was prompted by reports that the government was looking to withdraw support for a £200m loan facility Harland & Wolff had applied for through UK Export Finance. The money would allow it to borrow to pay off expensive debts owed to Riverstone Credit Partners, a US investor.

In the update, the company said further work was continuing on the facility and it expected that a decision would be made after Thursday’s general election.

It added: “Should there be any material delays to securing the facility post the general election, the company’s ability to execute new and large contracts would be adversely affected.”

The Guardian,https://www.theguardian.com/business/article/2024/jun/30/better-economic-news-will-not-stop-tories-from-suffering-their-biggest-ever-defeat,2024-06-30,10:14:41 UTC,Better economic news will not stop Tories from suffering their biggest ever defeat | Larry Elliott,"Down the years the Conservative party has taken some heavy election beatings but the one in prospect this week could be of a different order of magnitude.

Assuming the polls are right – and they have been consistent since the start of the campaign – the Tories will do worse even than in 1906, their previous nadir. Back then, the Conservatives and their Liberal Unionist allies won just 156 seats, a repeat of which on Thursday would now be considered a good result.

But in 1906, Arthur Balfour’s outgoing government secured more than 43% of the vote, while Rishi Sunak is polling at about half that level. And Balfour’s defeat could at least be attributed to a policy issue – free trade versus protectionism. Today, voters just seem sick of the Tories.

News on the economy since the election was called has had little or no impact on the polls. In part, that’s because the signals have been mixed: inflation fell back to its 2% target and growth in the first quarter of 2024 has been revised up, but the economy stagnated in April and unemployment has increased.

Living standards are certainly improving. The Resolution Foundation thinktank calculates that real per capita household disposable income – a guide to whether people are getting better off after inflation is taken into account – rose by 2.4% over the past year.

That’s the good news. The bad news is that over the 2019-24 parliament as a whole, living standards fell by 0.6% and one of the unwritten rules of political economy is that governments don’t remain popular when voters are getting poorer.

Only twice in the past century have living standards been lower at the end of a parliament than when it commenced: in 1918-22, when the UK suffered from a post-first world war boom-bust, and in the short parliament of 1950-51, when inflation rose sharply as a result of the rearmament programme for the Korean war.

In the inevitable postmortem examination that will follow the election, attention will focus on whether the Tories might have done better had Sunak delayed the election so that in time more voters would have come to think an economic corner genuinely had been turned. Another quarter or two of rising living standards would not have saved the Conservatives from defeat but it would probably have limited the scale of it.

As it is, Rachel Reeves will be the beneficiary. Analysts have been revising up their growth estimates for 2024 and 2025 on the basis that consumers will start to run down the precautionary savings they accumulated during the cost of living crisis.

Other recent developments – especially those overseas – are not so welcome. Joe Biden’s poor performance in his head to head debate with Donald Trump has made it more likely that the latter will win the US presidential election. Tariffs will be raised and taxes will be cut if that happens, threatening higher inflation and rising debt.

Meanwhile, the first round of voting in France’s parliamentary election looks set to show sizeable gains for Marine Le Pen’s rightwing National Rally party and a defeat for Emmanuel Macron’s centrist government.

Events in both the US and France highlight how things have changed in the near decade and a half since Labour was last in power.

Most obviously, the world has become a less safe place. The war between Ukraine and Russia is now well into its third year and has shattered the notion that permanent peace can be guaranteed for western developed nations. There are always demands for Labour governments to spend more on the NHS and on the welfare state. This time there will also be pressure to raise defence spending.

Globalisation has gone into retreat. Weak growth since the financial crisis of 2008-09 has seen a marked increase in protectionist measures – not just on goods but on people too. In Europe, North America and Australasia alike there have been demands for governments to restrict the number of foreign nationals entering the country.

What’s more, multilateral bodies are for the most part weaker than they were in 2010. The increasingly fractious relationship between the US and China means the G20 group of leading developed and developing nations cannot agree on much. The World Trade Organization is a much-diminished institution, unable to fulfil either of its core functions: to negotiate multilateral trade deals and be the final arbiter in trade disputes. The EU is having to contend with rising nationalist sentiment, a function of feeble economic performance and a reaction against rule by unelected technocrats.

The developing world has been even harder hit by Covid and the cost of living crisis than the rich west, increasing the incentive for migrants to look for a better life elsewhere. Yet aid budgets have been cut and promises to help poor countries cope with the impact of climate change have not been fulfilled. The world is getting hotter and the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank urgently need more money to meet demands for their assistance.

So those are the sort of challenges that Labour will face when it takes office later this week. Not the world of 1997, when Russia was seen as an ally rather than a strategic threat. Not the middle of the Great Moderation – the period between the fall of communism and the global financial crisis – when the west enjoyed year after year of growth and low inflation, but rather a world still trying to claw its way out of the Great Stagnation of the past 15 years.

And an angrier world where voters can quickly turn on their governments. Labour should enjoy its honeymoon period. It might not last long.","And Balfour’s defeat could at least be attributed to a policy issue – free trade versus protectionism.

We need an economy based on human rights,"Economic growth will bring prosperity to all. This is the mantra that guides the decision-making of the vast majority of politicians, economists and even human rights bodies.

Yet the reality – as detailed in a report to the United Nations Human Rights Council this month – shows that while poverty eradication has historically been promised through the “trickling down” or “redistribution” of wealth, economic growth largely “gushes up” to a privileged few.

In the past four years alone the world’s five richest men have more than doubled their fortunes, while nearly 5 billion people have been made poorer. If current trends continue, 575 million people will still be trapped in extreme poverty in 2030 – the deadline set by the world’s governments to eradicate it. Currently, more than 4 billion people have no access whatsoever to social protection.

Hundreds of millions of people are struggling to survive in a world that has never been wealthier; many are driven to exhaustion in poorly paid, often dangerous jobs to satisfy the needs of the elite and to boost corporate profits. In low-income countries, where significant investment is still required, growth can still serve a useful role. In practice, however, it is often extractive, relying on the exploitation of a cheap workforce and the plundering of natural resources.

Concrete steps can be taken now, starting with choosing measures of progress other than gross domestic product

The endless quest for growth at all costs, and the escalating use of the natural resources it demands, is pushing our planet way beyond its limits. Six of the nine “planetary boundaries” – Earth’s life-support systems – have already been crossed. For too long, the health of our planet has been sacrificed for inequitable material gain.

Our economies are failing us. We urgently need to look beyond profit, beyond the short term and beyond the interests of the few.

A “human rights economy” can deliver for people and the planet because it shifts our focus from growth to humanity – grounding the purpose of the economy in fundamental, universal human values. It offers human rights as a guardrail to keep the economy on track – meeting the challenges of the climate crisis, addressing inequalities and eradicating poverty.

This proposition is not some fairytale. Concrete steps can be taken now, starting with choosing measures of progress other than gross domestic product (GDP) – which tells us nothing about the ecological or social fallout of economic activity.

And we need to start valuing what really counts. GDP has no way of accounting for the estimated 16.4bn hours spent every day worldwide on unpaid work, largely carried out by women, that underpins the global economy: caring for children, people with disabilities and older citizens.

Unpaid domestic and care work should be remunerated through paid parental and carers’ leave, included in pension calculations, and supported through access to safe water, sanitation, affordable childcare facilities and other essential services.

Financing these services while reducing our dependence on GDP growth is achievable through progressive tax policies such as inheritance and wealth taxes, preventing illegal financial flows and tax evasion, and tackling corruption. More effective international cooperation on tax, debt and social protection is also needed.

This is a major undertaking. The barriers are real: most people have been led to believe that economic growth equals human progress. Yet a growing movement is rallying against our growth-driven economic model: climate activists, workers and trade unions, scientists and academics, young people, environmental and human rights defenders, Indigenous peoples, progressive economists, and activists fighting inequality, gender disparities and colonialism are speaking out.

As world leaders prepare to gather for the Summit of the Future in September – a UN initiative that aims to forge a global consensus around what our future should look like – this groundswell of support for an alternative vision of progress must be embraced. Without a roadmap for a global economy that protects human rights, including the right to a clean, healthy and sustainable environment, the final document leaders agree in New York will continue to lead us down the path to extinction.","Economic growth will bring prosperity to all.

It was a political choice on the part of George Osborne and David Cameron to advance their class interest, cleverly camouflaged by stories of Labour profligacy when the economic crisis to which it was the alleged response was caused by a surfeit of financial deregulation advocated by Osborne and Cameron and supinely accepted by Labour.

The American political economist Clara E Mattei, in her 2022 book, The Capital Order: How Economists Invented Austerity and Paved the Way to Fascism, showed how similar policies were applied in Britain and Italy after the first world war, essentially to keep workers in their place, and how in Italy they led to the rise of Mussolini and fascism. Let us be warned.

Prof Roger Brown

Paul Krugman is right about the impact of austerity on the UK economy – here are a couple of reasons why. First, those who advocate the shrinking of the state fail to appreciate how the economy is interdependent. Most public authorities require tendering for services. Generally, the private or voluntary sectors get the tender. So if the public sector is starved of finance and catches a cold, the private and voluntary sectors start to sneeze too.

Second, the assumption is that if the public sector is smaller, the private sector will take up the slack. This ignores the fact that the private sector’s bottom line is its profitability and ability to satisfy its shareholders, not the public interest. In practice, this means that the private sector will cherry-pick the easy and profitable tasks, as with the failed privatisation of the probation service, while leaving anything difficult or unprofitable to the public sector.

Alternatively, as with the failed privatisation of the railways, the private sector demands subsidies out of our taxes so that it can pay a dividend to its shareholders, thereby taking money out of the system that could otherwise be used to improve the infrastructure, reduce fares, or both.

Austerity was an ideological choice by the coalition government. While I would have expected little better from the Conservatives, I would have hoped that their Liberal Democrat coalition partners would have drawn enough red lines to prevent the government from following through on its economic illiteracy and choking off the first signs of recovery from the 2007-08 crash. As it is, we’ve suffered from the consequences ever since.

Paul Krugman does an excellent job of exposing the disastrous consequences of 14 years of austerity for both society and the economy. But in solely blaming the Tories, he neglects to acknowledge the role of the Liberal Democrats in both enabling austerity and even co-authoring the genesis of the policy through the key role played by the then chief secretary to the Treasury David Laws.

Although in post for only a short time, his role was pivotal in developing the first drastic cuts in public expenditure. We now live with the consequences of 14 years of monetarist dogma ruthlessly, pitilessly and unfairly applied.

The Guardian,https://www.theguardian.com/politics/article/2024/jun/29/transport-labour-tories-potholes-hs2-rail-road-pricing,2024-06-29,08:00:46 UTC,"From potholes to HS2, transport gets voters going – but some solutions are unsayable","Better railways, safer roads, cleaner fuels: in another decade, they would be the kind of transport issues commanding a pragmatic consensus in British politics.

But this election lands with transport wildly politicised, with clean air, speed limits and high-speed rail all dragged into the wider culture wars.

Meanwhile, transport has become emblematic of decline and the fraying public realm, from failing rail services to the potholes that pockmark Britain’s tarmac.

So what might the election resolve – and what are the transport policies deemed too difficult to sell?

The culture war battleground: drivers, Ulez and HS2

One of Keir Starmer’s less convincing recent repositionings may have been declaring Labour “the only party on the side of drivers” – a response to the long Conservative campaign to hammer home its backing for “people’s freedom to use their cars”.

The Tory plan for motorists was first outlined by the transport secretary, Mark Harper, in 2023 in a conference speech that appeared to echo online conspiracy theories about 15-minute cities, and signalled a clear move away from some of the urban planning measures the government had backed during Covid.

Now the party’s manifesto highlights its “backing drivers bill” in a chapter dedicated to “strengthening our communities”, pledging to curb low-traffic neighbourhoods (LTNs) and 20mph zones and reverse the expansion of London’s ultra-low emission zone (Ulez) – an unpopular move pinned firmly on Labour via the mayor, Sadiq Khan, despite the government’s own part in setting it up.

The rhetoric of ending a “war on motorists” is shared in Reform UK’s manifesto, which would scrap 20mph speed limits, LTNs and the Ulez, along with net zero commitments to transition from fossil fuel to electric vehicles.

Campaigners are concerned by the inflammatory language. Silviya Barrett, policy and research director of the Campaign for Better Transport (CBT), says: “We’re all more than just a driver, just a cyclist – we all need a range of means by which to move. Many drivers use buses and trains too, many walk their kids to school, and most drivers are keen to have more options.”

Another headline Conservative promise is to “stop road pricing”, implicitly accusing Labour of planning a pay-per-mile scheme. Starmer’s party has not backed any such policy, even though transport experts – including motoring organisations – believe some such scheme eventually must come.

Beyond roads, HS2 has perhaps been the only other transport issue as divisive. Scrapping the entire route, including that already half-built from London to Birmingham, is Reform’s headline transport policy, whose back-of-an-envelope calculations claim to save another £25bn.

Any mention of HS2 is conspicuously absent from Labour’s manifesto, while the Conservatives’ reiterates the derided “Network North” mixture of schemes funded by a putative £36bn saving from axing HS2’s northern leg. Only a lonely Liberal Democrat paragraph proposes finding a way to rekindle the high-speed railway to Manchester and beyond.

The post-election action areas: rail reform – and potholes

Despite the fate of the UK’s biggest engineering project, both big parties are pledging to speed up infrastructure delivery, with a Labour review under the ex-Siemens boss Jürgen Maier claiming both time and money could be saved.

But the humble pothole is perhaps focusing more minds: as Labour’s manifesto puts it, “the potholes cratering our roads are a visible sign of the decline after 14 years of Conservative rule”. The Tories have already earmarked £8bn to fill roads instead of building HS2. And even in a Labour manifesto where additional spending is all but forbidden, an extra £65m a year for potholes will be found by putting off a road-building scheme, the planned A27 bypass in West Sussex.

A bigger Labour pledge, but one that it argues is cost-free, is immediate rail reform, with the shadow transport secretary, Louise Haigh, promising “the biggest overhaul to our railways in a generation”.

Labour can afford to go large on reform plans that in many ways align with the Conservatives’ own belated attempts to force through change. Even what might once have been regarded as an ideological red line between the parties – partial renationalisation of rail – has been reluctantly enacted under the current government, as franchising collapsed and more train operators were taken into public hands.

Whoever wins, a new Great British Railways with a shake-up of the railway’s structure and fares is promised. The “guiding mind” will have plenty to work at: latest annual figures from the rail regulator, the Office of Rail and Road, show that only 85% of trains were officially on time (ie within five or 10 minutes of schedule) in 2023-24 – the worst performance in 19 years.

A critical task will be to end the disruption from rail’s long-running industrial relations standoff. While the Conservatives recommit to the ill-fated minimum service levels legislation, Labour makes no direct mention of the strikes, but a manifesto laced with references to working in partnership with unions to “end chaos” suggests a possible reset.

Off limits: road pricing and curbing flying

The vast majority of taxation from motoring comes from fuel duty paid via the petrol pump: about £27bn in annual Treasury revenue destined to dwindle and vanish as cars turn electric. For many transport experts, some form of road pricing appears inevitable and the fairest system. Politics, however, is likely to rule it out.

“Road pricing is toxic because it is very complicated,” says Steve Gooding, director of the RAC Foundation, who was once tasked as a civil servant with drawing up a plan that produced enormous public backlash. “People think – ‘I’m not driving in the rush hour because I like it, but because my employer wants me to turn up’.”

View image in fullscreen The Campaign for Better Transport advocates a charge of 2p a km for electric cars. Photograph: Ceri Breeze/Alamy

Barrett and the CBT have proposed a 2p per km charge for electric cars to make sure all drivers contribute to the exchequer. Gooding counsels that any scheme should be as simple as possible, citing the kind of pay-per-mile schemes being introduced in Iceland and New Zealand. He adds: “The dilemma is the government wants you to buy an electric car – but how do you do that if you charge people to drive it?”

But, he says: “I would be flabbergasted if someone in the Treasury building isn’t already doing that calculation. We all think this charge is coming. The sooner you are honest about it, the sooner people can factor it into their decisions.”

However, parties appear to be shying away from even the lip service paid to future net zero commitments. A Greenpeace/Friends of the Earth manifesto analysis scores the Conservatives on 1.5 out of 10 on transport, compared with 4.5 for Labour and 8.5 and 9 for the Lib Dems and Greens respectively.

Tackling aviation emissions is a harder, and could be even less electorally popular to fix than the transition for cars. The Lib Dems and Greens espouse some kind of frequent flyer levy, a ban on short domestic flights where a rail alternative exists, and increased taxation, on private jets in particular. Both main parties affirm support for the sector and its dubious solution of sustainable aviation fuels.","But this election lands with transport wildly politicised, with clean air, speed limits and high-speed rail all dragged into the wider culture wars.

The Guardian,https://www.theguardian.com/environment/article/2024/jul/01/north-sea-oil-transition-plan,2024-07-01,10:43:07 UTC,North Sea oil decline: ‘We can’t have a repeat of what happened to 80s miners’,"“In this city, everyone feels the decline of the North Sea,” says Chris Douglas, 39, who has lived in Aberdeen his whole life and began working as a taxi driver in the Granite City 20 years ago. He now has his own cab company, which in the past was entirely reliant on bookings from the oil and gas industry – today it’s “maybe 50%”, he says.

“You only have to look around: there are industrial estates decimated, hotels no longer trading. The good days are long gone,” he says. “And no political party is coming along to say they are going to rejuvenate the industry. There are just different plans for how to close it down.”

The oil and gas fields in the North Sea are in terminal decline. Last year, the oil basin produced 34m tonnes of oil, its lowest since production in the North Sea was established in the 1970s. As its accessible fossil fuels dwindle, big oil companies have pulled out of the ageing oil basin. And despite the government issuing a rush of licences since Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, the amount of oil set to be extracted is rapidly shrinking.

Meanwhile, the climate crisis – fuelled by gas, oil and coal extraction – is accelerating at a frightening speed and the world’s leading scientists and energy analysts are clear: there can be no new oil and gas projects if humanity is to avoid catastrophe.

In the far north-east of Scotland, this combination of factors could spell disaster for the almost 60,000 workers supported by the oil and gas industry, their families and communities. For the past four decades they have prospered on the well-paid, secure jobs North Sea oil has provided. But now they are looking into an abyss.

“Most of my friends went into the North Sea industry because for them, and for their fathers and their grandfathers, it has always been seen as a sure thing. Does the green economy offer that same security, the same pay?” Douglas says.

This is a crucial moment for these communities, according to Joe Rollin, a senior organiser at the union Unite, which represents tens of thousands of oil and gas workers. “We simply can’t let these workers be the coalminers of this generation, with all the devastation to lives and communities that would entail,” he says.

This is the challenge facing politicians in Westminster and Holyrood before this week’s general election. How do they manage the inevitable and urgent decline of North Sea oil and gas – and can they ensure a just transition to new low-carbon jobs that are fully unionised, well-paid and secure?

For Mika Minio-Paluello, a policy officer at the Trades Union Congress (TUC), there is a lot on the line.

“Whatever happens to the people working in North Sea oil and gas, it is being closely watched by those in different industries and sectors – not just across the UK but also in other countries – to see if we can take working people on this journey.

“It is a test case in some ways, for the whole idea of a just transition, of what happens when we decarbonise … we simply can’t have a repeat of what happened to coal workers in the 80s.”

The spectre of the miners’ plight after the pit closures in the 1980s hangs over this debate. The communities that were decimated when the then Conservative prime minister Margaret Thatcher closed the pits and smashed the coalminers’ union never recovered.

Arguably the stakes now are even higher. The escalating climate crisis demands a rapid end to fossil fuel production, but the populist right across Europe is on the rise and it has climate action in their sights – describing it as a remote, elite project being done at the expense of ordinary workers.

The UK’s main political parties are divided on the issue. The Conservative party is still promising to “max out” oil and gas in the North Sea by granting licences for new exploration every year. Meanwhile, Labour has promised to put an end to new licences, and raise taxes on the large profits being made by companies operating in the North Sea. The party is also promising “not a single job” will be lost during the transition.

In response, the Scottish National party has U-turned on its pledge to phase out fossil fuel licences and is trying to tread a “middle ground”, saying it will approve licences if they meet strict climate conditions – although most experts struggle to see how this could be possible.

Nigel Farage, the leader of the insurgent populist Reform UK party, is waiting to capitalise, vowing at his manifesto launch last month to axe net zero policies and fast-track licences to open up the North Sea.

“If we fail to do this transition in a way that takes communities with us, then we leave the way open for Farage and the far right,” said Minio-Paluello. “The risk of the far right culture wars building a wave of support on the back of our failure is very, very real.”

There is little doubt the writing is on the wall for the industry. Experts point out that the number of jobs supported directly and indirectly by oil and gas has more than halved in the past decade – from 441,000 to 214,00 – during which time the government has issued roughly 400 new licences in six licensing rounds.

According to the former head of the oil and gas regulator, new licences would make a difference to gas production only “around the edges”. Even BP’s former chief executive has said North Sea drilling is “not going to make any difference” to Britain’s energy security.

Ajay Parmar, a director at ICIS, a commodity data provider, says:“The UK’s oil supply decline has been in the works for decades. Labour’s policy will hasten the decline but only marginally.”

Critics of the Tory pitch to “max out” North Sea oil claim it is part of a culture war framing what will only result in workers being stranded in a declining industry with no plan to save their livelihoods or communities.

Analysts and trade unions agree that unless it is managed properly, the transition will have a devastating impact on the Scottish economy. According to a report by the consultancy EY, which was commissioned by the Scottish government, North Sea workers have an annual average salary of £88,000, while those working in the oil and gas supply chain earn an average of £51,000 a year. This is well above the average annual salary of £29,000 in Scotland – and above the £42,600 average wage of employees in the clean energy sector, according to figures from the Energy and Climate Intelligence Unit.

As high-wage oil jobs are replaced with clean energy roles, the gross value of Scotland’s employment sector could plummet from £19bn a year in 2019 to £12bn by 2050, according to the report.

For people like Dale Green, who has been working on the rigs for the past 22 years, those statistics could be life-changing.

“When I was growing up, the only option for me really if I wanted a good job, good money, was to work on the rigs,” says the 39-year-old scaffolder. “It has allowed me to move on from the council estate where I grew up and to be able to afford a decent life – to look after my children, get a house, get a car.”

Dale fears that unless the transition is properly managed the chances he has had will be denied to future generations.

“Taking away opportunities that someone like me has enjoyed, a scaffolder from a working-class community who grew up on a council estate, it could just decimate certain areas,” said Green.

If it wins the election, Labour plans to set up a taskforce with Scottish Labour, the big energy companies and the unions to “secure a future for every oil and gas worker”. It says the new jobs will mostly be in renewables, carbon capture and storage, and hydrogen.

But Labour has dropped its expertly costed £28bn-a-year green investment pledge, sparking concerns among unions and environmental campaigners about whether it had set aside sufficient funds to ensure a smooth transition from fossil fuels.

Critics say the party’s plans are vague, that there is little or no industrial base in Scotland, and that there are few renewable jobs to transfer workers to. They argue a well-funded, pro-active industrial strategy will be required to create the jobs in wind turbine manufacturing, installation and maintenance, as well as in the wider supply chain for renewables.

Unite says much more needs to be done. Its general secretary, Sharon Graham, refused to sign off the party’s manifesto at its “clause V” last month – in part because of fears Labour’s plans for oil and gas workers in the North Sea were too vague.

“We should not be letting go of one rope until we have hold of another,” Graham said earlier this year. “These types of transitions must have workers at the heart. Unite will not stand by and let these workers be thrown on the scrap heap.”

The union is running a grassroots “No ban without a plan” campaign across north-east Scotland, urging Labour to outline more detailed and funded proposals before banning new licences. Last week, more than 200 small businesses published a letter backing the campaign and calling on Labour to spell out exactly where the jobs will come from.

Previously, this position might have seen trade unions pitted against climate groups calling for a rapid winding down of the industry. However, behind the scenes there has been an unlikely alliance emerging.

Last week, 60 leading climate organisations including Greenpeace UK, Friends of the Earth England, Wales and Northern Ireland, Oxfam UK and Extinction Rebellion signed an open letter calling for a “clear and funded” transition plan for workers and communities reliant on the oil and gas industry.

The letter, which was sent to all party leaders, is based on a report created in consultation with workers and backed by Unite, the National Union of Rail, Maritime and Transport Workers (RMT), the Public and Commercial Services Union (PCS), and Unison Scotland.

A spokesperson for Unite says the union welcomed “support from the climate movement”.

“We are fully behind a transition to greener energy, but this must be a fair transition, one that has workers and communities at its heart … we will continue to work with climate groups who are calling for ambitious government action on a just transition.”

Ruby Earle, from the campaign group Platform, which helped coordinate the letter, says it shows “how far the climate movement and unions have come in building relationships”.

“Government support for a just transition cannot be an afterthought. A clear and funded industrial strategy, alongside publicly owned energy, is not only essential for workers, communities, and the millions of people living in fuel poverty, but also to ensure the transition happens within climate limits.”

Jake Molloy, a former oil and gas worker and trade unionist for almost 20 years, who now sits on the Scottish government’s Just Transition Commission, is at the sharp end of this emerging coalition.

“If I had suggested, 20 years ago [to his colleagues in the industry] that they go and meet Greenpeace or another climate group, they would have thought I meant for a fight because these groups were seen as wanting to destroy our jobs, our communities.”

But he says that has changed in recent years, with a huge amount of work going on behind the scenes. Molloy says this has resulted in more climate groups recognising that the necessary transition away from fossil fuels cannot be done at the expense of ordinary working people. At the same time, some unions and workers have accepted that the transition is necessary and – if done correctly – positive.

“More and more people on both sides are realising that this is an industrial revolution on an unprecedented scale and that we need change – change so fundamental as to strip away the ideology that we’ve worked in for the last 40 years.”

Molloy warns that many of the much-heralded “new jobs” in renewables do not exist in Scotland – citing a recent windfarm development that has been built, installed and maintained entirely by overseas companies and governments.

Tessa Khan, the director of campaign group Uplift, says the next government needs to “get everyone around the table – the Scottish government, trade unions, worker representatives and affected communities – to come up with a coherent plan that works in everyone’s interests”.

Crucially, she says, the transition plans must be taken out of the hands of the oil and gas industry.

“The majority of operators in the basin invest nothing in UK renewable energy, but nor are they investing in UK oil and gas production. The record profits of recent years have gone to their shareholders, not to investment in the transition. [They] aren’t interested in creating clean jobs and growing the UK economy but in making as much money as they can for themselves, for as long they can get away with it.”

Last month the supreme court in London ruled the climate impact of burning oil and gas must be taken into account when deciding whether to approve projects.

Experts say this is likely to be another nail in the coffin of North Sea oil and gas, making it it harder to secure new licences. It could even threaten some of those that have been approved, including the controversial Rosebank oil and gas field, to be operated by the Norwegian company Equinor.

A Labour source said if the party did form the next government, and Rosebank was still in the balance, then ministers could refuse the remaining consents it needed to operate.

Molloy, who has spent years working on a just transition for his colleagues in the industry, says whatever the result in the election it is essential that politicians and corporations are not able to pit those worried about the climate crisis against those who want to ensure a decent future for workers, their families and communities.

“I‘ve got four grandsons who will never forgive me if I get this wrong, and I’ve been trying for considerable time to get it right, because their future – and that of millions around the world – relies on us getting this right.”","There are just different plans for how to close it down.”The oil and gas fields in the North Sea are in terminal decline.

JN, London

This is an unnerving experience. It does seem likely the stranger has used your address to validate a fake identity to claim benefits or credit. The good news is that he does not appear to have stolen your names and therefore you don’t face a trashed credit rating.

Credit reports are based on an individual, not an address, and you are not liable for any bills or fines he incurs using your address.

The bad news is there’s no simple way of stopping the flow of mail other than sending it back marked “not known at this address”.

Scratch out the barcode on the envelope in case a human eye does not read and note your message. Keep your household’s entry on the electoral register up to date so that anyone not resident is removed, and keep an eye on bank statements.

The time to worry is if unfamiliar transactions start appearing in your name. You could consider applying for protective registration with the crime prevention agency Cifas.

A warning flag against your name and address will show you are at heightened risk of identity fraud, so organisations will know to carry out extra checks to ensure they are dealing with you, not a fraudster.

Several lenders offer “concessionary purchase” mortgages, meaning that a tenant can buy the property they are living in from their landlord at a marked-down price.

There has been a rise in take-up as tax changes on buy-to-lets and much higher mortgage costs prompt more landlords to sell. Now TSB, one of the lenders that offers these deals, reports significant demand.

“It’s gone from a product we never really spoke about to something that regularly comes up. We’re doing a steady number … there’s a demand for it,” says Roland McCormack, TSB’s mortgage distribution director.

For tenants given the chance to buy this way, it may be the best financial deal they are ever offered. And while it involves a landlord agreeing to take a lower price than they could potentially get on the open market, it also means a quicker, smoother sale – and no estate agent fees.

How do they work, and who can get them?

Quite a few banks and building societies offer mortgages that allow someone to buy a family member’s property for less than its market value – for example, when a parent wants to help their child on to the property ladder, so agrees to sell at a discounted price.

However, some lenders also accept mortgage applications from sitting tenants wanting to buy from their landlord, and from employees wanting to buy from their employer.

These are basically standard mortgages, but with one or two key differences.

Crucially, the seller typically has to agree to sell for at least 10% below its market value. Many landlords might find that hard to swallow. However, the seller will enjoy cost savings that, it is claimed, could offset about half of that loss.

In many, but not all, cases, the tenant does not need to put down a penny of their own cash as a deposit – in mortgage-speak, the landlord is giving the tenant “a gift of equity”, which is taken by the lender as a deposit. Assuming a 10% discount, the buyer would then take out a 90% loan-to-value (LTV) mortgage.

However, the buyer may wish to put in some of their own money to boost the deposit and bring down the LTV, which hopefully will give them access to a better rate.

The discount has to be a gift, not a loan, with no conditions attached.

These deals are something of a niche product but are clearly enjoying a bit of a moment.

Which banks or lenders offer these deals?

In addition to TSB, there’s the likes of Halifax, Nationwide, Barclays and NatWest.

Terms can vary. For example, TSB and Nationwide are among those that explicitly state they do not require the tenant to put down any deposit. However, both Barclays and NatWest say buyers need to contribute their own deposit on top – a minimum of 5%.

Typically, this is going to be an arrangement between a private landlord and tenant, though TSB and Halifax say the landlord can also be a local authority, indicating this could be an option for a council tenant where the right to buy is not available.

Why would a landlord agree to do this?

A combination of a less favourable tax regime for buy-to-let properties, and a string of mortgage-rate rises over the last two years, has led to many landlords baling out of the rented sector or evaluating their options. So there will definitely be some who are keen to sell.

By selling to their tenant, they avoid paying the costs normally associated with a house sale – notably estate agent fees, which can vary from less than 1% to as much as 3.5%. It also means they will not be paying perhaps several months of mortgage interest while the property is empty and on the market.

McCormack reckons those two savings will in effect cut the amount the landlord is giving away from 10% to more like 5%. “They are still out of pocket, but it’s a much smoother transaction for them,” he adds. “They don’t have to have a tenant move out of the property, do it all up and then wait several months – all while not receiving rent.”

On top of that, the landlord does not have to bother finding a buyer and dealing with lots of inquiries about the property.

One of the key benefits for a landlord would be the speed of a sale, “and, potentially, they don’t want to do a disservice to a tenant who has perhaps been living there for a long time”, says David Hollingworth of broker L&C Mortgages. If the landlord has made a decent amount from the property and has a good relationship with the tenant, they may like the idea of helping them become a homeowner.

Is this as good as it seems for the buyer?

Yes: they typically don’t need a deposit and are saving at least 10% on the market value.

Also, they know the property and the area, says McCormack. “They know the heating works, they know the neighbourhood, they know the glitches and they know the neighbours.”

A landlord’s £31,000 ‘gift’

First-time buyers Graham and Lisa received a huge financial helping hand to get on the housing ladder in the form of a £31,000 equity “gift” from their landlord to buy the home they had been living in for over three years.

They started renting the two-bedroom bungalow near Cheltenham in late 2019, and then, early last year, the landlord said he was looking to sell.

The couple, who had been thinking of trying to buy the property, spoke to a mortgage adviser who suggested a TSB concessionary purchase mortgage.

The couple made sure the terms were OK with the landlord – in particular, the 10% discount. He agreed, and they went ahead.

The house had a market value of £310,000. Once the £31,000 discount was applied, they required a £279,000 loan.

“We put in another £20K, so the deposit was £51,000,” says Graham, 32. That meant they were able to take out a mortgage (a five-year fix) for £259,000.

“This is probably the easiest way we could have got on the ladder,” says Graham, a production engineer working in aerospace. The couple did not need to move or compete with other buyers or “deal with any of the really difficult parts of housebuying”.

They are paying more monthly than they were when they were renting. “However, it’s into a mortgage, and the property is ours. Of course, we’ve got £30K of equity we did not pay for,” says Graham.","A growing number of people are taking out a little-known type of mortgage that allows them to buy a property without having to put down a deposit.

When they arrived, they found their view of the stage completely blocked by a tent and large items of technical equipment shrouded in black plastic.

They asked to be moved and were put in the very back corner next to fans who had paid a fraction of what I had.

AXS appears to be ignoring my email suggesting they sold tickets that were not as described.

ST, Gloucester

The premium package you purchased promised “unforgettable seats” along with branded merchandise. A restricted view was not mentioned, either, on the sales page or the confirmation. “Unforgettable”, at least, was an accurate description. Your daughters say they will never forget the disappointment.

AE of Faversham, Kent fears her Taylor Swift tickets in August will be similarly memorable, for she too has booked VIP seats, paying over £1,320 for two.

Feedback and photos from friends and social media suggest that she has also invested in a view of a large tent and bulky sound equipment.

“From the row we’ve been allocated, it looks as though we’ll just about be able to see the screen but nothing else,” she writes. “I’ve asked AXS for the VIP tickets we were sold – with a view of the stage – but have had no response and neither have friends who have already attended the concert and found they could see nothing.”

Other furious fans have reported on social media that their premium seats were barricaded behind stage equipment. The tent that blocks the view, ironically, is to lodge celebrity guests who probably get their tickets gratis.

Seats with a restricted view are supposed to be advertised as such, and priced accordingly. The venues are vast, and the stage viewed from the seated areas is always going to be in the far distance. But it’s an outrage fans have seemingly been misled into paying for a first-class experience when the stage configuration prevents them seeing it at all.

Neither AXS nor its sister ­company AEG Presents, the organiser of the tour, responded to my request for comment. They don’t need to. Performances are a sellout, with fans prepared to pay any money to get a seat.

ST’s next option is to make a claim for breach of contract and statutory rights via the small claims court, now Money Claim Online. The Consumer Rights Act states that purchases must be as described and fit for purpose, and ST can claim the difference between the price she paid, and the price of the seats her daughters ended up in. According to consumer lawyer Gary Rycroft, she can also try claiming for damages.

AE’s situation is less clear-cut, he says, since she has not yet attended the concert. “If the retailer offers a full refund, the logic is she will either have to agree, or not,” he says. “A cynical retailer may take a view that Swifty is in such demand they can easily sell on a refunded ticket at a similar price with full disclosure of the restricted view.”

On the night, you could demand to be moved, citing the Consumer Rights Act, and take photos of the blocked view to support any claim.

However, the latest cap applies only from July until the end of September, and bills are expected to rise again this winter, leaving millions struggling to heat their homes.

Monday’s adjustment reflects lower costs in the wholesale gas and electricity markets – but bills are still more than £500 a year higher than they were before Russia’s war on Ukraine upended global energy prices.

National Energy Action (NEA) has estimated that about 5.6 million households in Great Britain will remain in fuel poverty over the summer, even with lower prices.

Adam Scorer, NEA’s chief executive, said: “Any drop in energy bills is welcome, but modest falls in summer look set to be wiped out by bigger rises in autumn when people will need to put the heating back on.”

The energy price cap is expected to rise by 10% to £1,723 a year from October, according to analysts at the energy consultancy Cornwall Insight, as wholesale markets have climbed higher. It expects bills to remain at a similar level into the first months of 2025.

Analysts at the Energy and Climate Intelligence Unit (ECIU), a thinktank, have warned that energy prices are likely to remain significantly higher than they were before the Russian invasion for the rest of the decade.

The conflict has ended Europe’s gas pipeline imports from Russia, which was once its largest source of gas. This has left European markets more exposed to global energy price fluctuations as it relies more on imports from the US and the Middle East.

Europe’s gas market prices were lower in the early months of the year after a relatively mild winter, allowing energy bills to fall this summer. But markets have started to climb again, in part due to stronger gas demand from Asian economies, which will spell higher bills again this winter.

Simon Cran-McGreehin, the head of analysis at the ECIU, said: “The UK’s high dependence on gas for electricity generation and heating has cost bill payers £2,000 so far during the gas crisis, and the economy as a whole tens of billions of pounds.”

“Commonsense measures like investing in insulating the poorest homes, switching to electric heat pumps and fast-tracking British renewables will leave us less vulnerable to the whims of the international gas markets,” he said.

The consumer group Which? has urged households to take a meter reading as close to 30 June as possible “to ensure you don’t pay over the odds for any energy used after the new price cap takes effect”.

Scorer said: “Whoever is in power on 5 July inherits a fuel poverty crisis that causes misery, despair, ill-health and early death. A new government will need a new plan.

The Guardian,https://www.theguardian.com/money/article/2024/jun/29/unpaid-uk-carers-financial-hit-income-benefits-bills,2024-06-29,06:00:49 UTC,Unpaid UK carers ‘face financial hit that can last decades’,"People who look after family members free of charge are taking a huge hit to their finances which could continue into their retirement as they find themselves unable to balance paid work with their caring commitments.

Recent analysis of official figures by the financial firm Just Retirement found seven in 10 people who were receiving carer’s allowance were not in paid work, and missing out on earnings and private pension contributions.

Andresearch last year by the charity Carers UK found that 40% of those providing high levels of care for an ill, elderly or disabled relative or friend had left their employment, while 22% had reduced their working hours.

“Too often for unpaid carers in work, the immense stresses and challenges of the role with little support can mean having to reduce working hours or come out of the workplace altogether,” says Helen Walker, the chief executive of Carers UK. “This can have a significant impact on household finances, exacerbated by the current cost of living crisis.”

With just days to go until the election, the party that looks most likely to take power has said very little about what it would do to help the UK’s army of unpaid carers. The Labour manifesto does not include a single mention of the word “carer”. The Conservative manifesto does include a few brief mentions. Only the Liberal Democrats have put forward substantial proposals for better support.

Carer’s allowance is now worth £81.90 a week and is available to people who provide at least 35 hours a week of care to a disabled person.

Carers UK has been conducting an annual survey for several years, each time asking people about the impact of their role on their finances. Last year, it found 75% of those receiving carer’s allowance were struggling with cost-of-living pressures, with almost half cutting back on essentials including food and heating. The proportion saying that they were struggling to make ends meet had risen to 45%, from 39% in 2022.

The survey found that 72% were worried about the financial hit from expenses linked to caring, such as petrol for hospital visits, heating and specific dietary requirements.

Those who were employed worked in low-paid jobs as a result of the strict rules around carer’s allowance. An earnings limit means you do not qualify if you earn more than £151 a week – after that, you lose the entire benefit. The Guardian has revealed that carers who have inadvertently earned more have been taken to court by the Department for Work and Pensions.

Carers UK and Just Retirement say that these rules make it hard for people to stay in paid work.

“Removing unnecessary pressures and ensuring those who can, and want to, remain in paid work is essential,” Walker says.

She says the low level of the payments doesn’t recognise what carers do, “and there are clear problems in the way that it’s delivered, making even small amounts of work challenging. Raising the earnings limit is something that would help more carers to stay in paid work and help avoid some devastating overpayments.”

Stephen Lowe from Just Retirement says carer’s allowance was never intended to be a “wage” or payment for caring services. “However, if the rules are stopping or limiting people from taking up employment and earnings opportunities that are available to them, then we have to question whether it is fit for purpose.”

He warns that if people restrict their work or give it up entirely to provide care, “that loss of income and other work benefits such as employer pension contributions is likely to have an impact on their lives for decades to come, as well as on the businesses who lose key staff.”

Among proposals in the party manifestos for next week’s general election are a pledge by the Lib Dems to increase carer’s allowance by £20 a week and to introduce a new earnings taper of £183, after which carers would start to lose some of their allowance. Labour has previously said it would review the system but included no details in its election pledges.

Walker says that without better support for working carers, the problems they face will show no sign of abating.

“The last decade has seen a significant rise in the number of hours of unpaid care being provided and a reduction in social care available,” she says. “Our recent YouGov research revealed that 62% of UK adults – the equivalent of 10 million current or former unpaid carers – said they have had no choice about taking on an unpaid caring role.”","Carers UK has been conducting an annual survey for several years, each time asking people about the impact of their role on their finances.

While students are exempt from the tax during the course, they are liable to pay as soon as they finish their final year.

The UK government says student status ends the day after the close of a university’s summer term, usually at the beginning of June.

Student accommodation leases from private landlords typically run until late June, July or even August, and this discrepancy means the risk of a surprise bill.

Megan Lloyd, a debt expert at Citizens Advice, says: “Students become liable for council tax from the day after they formally stop being a student. This could be when their course officially ends, or the day after they abandon it or get dismissed from their studies.

“For example, if a student’s final term ends on 10 June, they will become liable for council tax from 11 June,” she says.

She adds: “This only applies to final-year students; students don’t have to pay council tax during the summer holidays between years of study.”

Manchester city council has already sent out letters billing graduating students for days since term ended. Other councils are less proactive.

A spokesperson for Council Tax Advisors said: “It’s advisable for students to check with their local council for precise details, as there can be variations in how councils handle the end of term exemptions and the start of council tax liability.”

Council tax bills are based on a property’s value so how much students could become liable for depends on the property they are renting.

According to Gov.uk, from 2024 to 2025, the average bill for a band D property (priced between £68,001 and £88,000 in value on 1 April 1991) will be £2,171 a year. This is about £181 a month – a lot when a third of students live off less than £50.

Students who receive a letter or due payment notice should take action so it does not result in a debt.

There can be serious consequences for council tax arrears, including legal action or a visit from a bailiff.

Students who can prove they are no longer living in the property may be able to get an exemption at their council’s discretion.

However, for the most part, those in this position will need to pay.

A number of fixed-rate savings bonds currently pay 5%-plus – on these accounts your return is guaranteed and you will be earning more than twice the current rate of inflation.

However, with most analysts expecting the first Bank of England base rate cut in August or September, followed by several more over the next year or two, the rates available right now may not hang around for long, some commenters claim.

Mark Hicks, a savings expert at investment firm Hargreaves Lansdown, says: “This is a window of opportunity for savers, so now is the time to clamber in and grab a decent rate before it closes.”

Lucinda O’Brien, of the comparison website money.co.uk, has a similar message: “Now is the time to act, before it’s too late.”

Earlier this month it was announced that inflation measured by the consumer prices index (CPI) fell to 2% in May. It’s a far cry from the period in 2022 and 2023 when inflation was running at 10% to 11%, eating into the value of millions of people’s nest-eggs.

Many of the highest-paying savings accounts offering a rate of 5%-plus are fixed-rate deals where you have to tie your money up for 12 months.

At the time of writing, a number of players were offering one-year fixed-rate savings bonds paying 5.2% or more. These include the My Community Bank credit union and Union Bank of India (UK), both paying 5.22%; Vanquis Bank, offering 5.21%; and Close Brothers Savings, paying 5.2%.

These require a minimum deposit of £1,000, except Close Brothers Savings, which requires £10,000 to open an account.

However, Sarah Coles, the head of personal finance at Hargreaves Lansdown, says that while you can earn the most interest with a one-year fixed-rate account, “you would need to track down another fix when it matured [and] there’s a decent chance the rates on offer by then will be significantly lower”.

This is why two-year fixed savings bonds are looking attractive, she says. “You could consider tying up any cash you don’t need for two years, and making the most of the great rates while they’re around.”

On Thursday, the highest-paying two-year fixed-rate savings bonds were those offered by Vanquis Bank and Close Brothers Savings, paying 5.06% on minimum balances of £1,000 and £10,000 respectively.

Other providers offering two-year fixed savings accounts boasting best-buy rates included Hodge Bank (4.97%), Market Harborough building society (4.95%), and Atom Bank (4.9%). The minimum deposits for these are £1,000, £10,000 and £50 respectively.

“This is a really sensible time to consider locking in a fixed rate,” says Coles. She believes the Bank of England is not going to be in a hurry to cut rates, but they are likely to get progressively lower. “By the middle of next year [rates] are forecast to be 4.5%, and by the middle of 2026 they are expected to hit 4%.”

It is a good idea to review your savings rates anyway, if you have not done so during the past six to 12 months, says Rachel Springall, of the financial data provider Moneyfacts.

Loyalty “does not always pay”, and the average easy-access account interest rate paid across the biggest high street banks is 2.01%, which is 0.05% less than it was six months ago, based on a snapshot of rates on 19 June.","UK savers are being urged to lock into an inflation-beating savings account before interest rates start their downward journey.

Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of business, the financial markets and the world economy.

Sales at Sainsbury’s have slowed despite a 25% jump in people buying TVs during Euro 2024, partly because of a big drop in sales at its Argos chain.

Food inflation has eased, and the supermarket group battled a “tough trading backdrop” on clothing and general merchandise amid poor weather and the cost of living crisis.

Like-for-like sales (at stores open at least a year), excluding fuel, slowed to 2.7% in the 16 weeks to 22 June, from 4.8% in the previous quarter.

Food sales growth eased to 4.8% from 7.3% as inflation across the market eased.

Argos sales plunged by 6.2% in the latest quarter, because people bought less garden furniture, paddling pools and other seasonal products than last year due to cold and wet weather. Sales electronics such as video games were also weak.

Sainsbury’s said:

Consumers continue to shop general merchandise more cautiously but respond to value. More positive signs are coming through now in general merchandise with the better weather and the Summer of Sport ramping up.

As the warm weather hit last week, people immediately stocked up on cooling and garden products. Sainsbury’s said it sold more fans in one week than it had in the year to date. Thanks to the euros, TV sales have surged, as fans upgraded to better sets ahead of the big matches.

The supermarket chain stuck to its forecast of a retail underlying operating profit of between £1.01bn and £1.06bn this year, up between 5% and 10% from last year.

Later this morning, we’ll be getting ‘flash’ inflation figures for June from the eurozone.

Inflation in the 20-nation eurozone is expected to have fallen slightly, to 2.5% from 2.6% in May.

Eurostat, the European Commission’s office, will release the data at 10am BST. The core rate, which excludes volatile items like food and energy, is forecast to have eased to 2.8% from 2.9%.

We need an economy based on human rights,"Economic growth will bring prosperity to all. This is the mantra that guides the decision-making of the vast majority of politicians, economists and even human rights bodies.

Yet the reality – as detailed in a report to the United Nations Human Rights Council this month – shows that while poverty eradication has historically been promised through the “trickling down” or “redistribution” of wealth, economic growth largely “gushes up” to a privileged few.

In the past four years alone the world’s five richest men have more than doubled their fortunes, while nearly 5 billion people have been made poorer. If current trends continue, 575 million people will still be trapped in extreme poverty in 2030 – the deadline set by the world’s governments to eradicate it. Currently, more than 4 billion people have no access whatsoever to social protection.

Hundreds of millions of people are struggling to survive in a world that has never been wealthier; many are driven to exhaustion in poorly paid, often dangerous jobs to satisfy the needs of the elite and to boost corporate profits. In low-income countries, where significant investment is still required, growth can still serve a useful role. In practice, however, it is often extractive, relying on the exploitation of a cheap workforce and the plundering of natural resources.

Concrete steps can be taken now, starting with choosing measures of progress other than gross domestic product

The endless quest for growth at all costs, and the escalating use of the natural resources it demands, is pushing our planet way beyond its limits. Six of the nine “planetary boundaries” – Earth’s life-support systems – have already been crossed. For too long, the health of our planet has been sacrificed for inequitable material gain.

Our economies are failing us. We urgently need to look beyond profit, beyond the short term and beyond the interests of the few.

A “human rights economy” can deliver for people and the planet because it shifts our focus from growth to humanity – grounding the purpose of the economy in fundamental, universal human values. It offers human rights as a guardrail to keep the economy on track – meeting the challenges of the climate crisis, addressing inequalities and eradicating poverty.

This proposition is not some fairytale. Concrete steps can be taken now, starting with choosing measures of progress other than gross domestic product (GDP) – which tells us nothing about the ecological or social fallout of economic activity.

And we need to start valuing what really counts. GDP has no way of accounting for the estimated 16.4bn hours spent every day worldwide on unpaid work, largely carried out by women, that underpins the global economy: caring for children, people with disabilities and older citizens.

Unpaid domestic and care work should be remunerated through paid parental and carers’ leave, included in pension calculations, and supported through access to safe water, sanitation, affordable childcare facilities and other essential services.

Financing these services while reducing our dependence on GDP growth is achievable through progressive tax policies such as inheritance and wealth taxes, preventing illegal financial flows and tax evasion, and tackling corruption. More effective international cooperation on tax, debt and social protection is also needed.

This is a major undertaking. The barriers are real: most people have been led to believe that economic growth equals human progress. Yet a growing movement is rallying against our growth-driven economic model: climate activists, workers and trade unions, scientists and academics, young people, environmental and human rights defenders, Indigenous peoples, progressive economists, and activists fighting inequality, gender disparities and colonialism are speaking out.

As world leaders prepare to gather for the Summit of the Future in September – a UN initiative that aims to forge a global consensus around what our future should look like – this groundswell of support for an alternative vision of progress must be embraced. Without a roadmap for a global economy that protects human rights, including the right to a clean, healthy and sustainable environment, the final document leaders agree in New York will continue to lead us down the path to extinction.","Economic growth will bring prosperity to all.

The Guardian,https://www.theguardian.com/money/article/2024/jul/02/next-uk-government-poised-to-benefit-from-fall-in-inflation-and-fuel-prices,2024-07-01,23:01:27 UTC,Next UK government poised to benefit from fall in inflation and fuel prices,"Britain’s next government is poised to benefit from easing pressure on household finances after a slowdown in inflation in stores and a fall in fuel prices, but costs remain “too expensive” for many families.

Figures from the British Retail Consortium (BRC) show that annual UK shop price inflation cooled last month to 0.2%, down from 0.6% in May – the slowest pace since October 2021 – as retailers cut the prices of many of their key products, including butter and coffee.

Coming before Thursday’s general election, separate figures from the RAC show that petrol and diesel prices fell for a second straight month in June to ease pressure on families affected by the cost of living crisis. The organisation said, however, that filling up on the forecourt was still “too expensive” in England, Wales and Scotland.

According to the RAC’s monthly fuel watch, the average price of petrol in the UK at the end of June was just under 145p a litre, down from 148p at the start of the month. Diesel dropped from nearly 154p to about 150p.

“Fuel prices are still nowhere near where they should be despite falling for the second consecutive month,” the RAC said. It highlighted the lower cost of filling up in Northern Ireland, where petrol is 4.5p a litre cheaper on average and diesel 8p cheaper than in the rest of the UK.

The RAC’s head of policy, Simon Williams, said: “While it’s good news prices at the pumps have fallen for the second month in a row, this also leaves a bad taste in the mouth because we know drivers in Great Britain are continuing to get a raw deal as both petrol and diesel are still much more expensive than in Northern Ireland.”

He said prices at forecourts owned and run by Shell and BP were the most expensive, highlighting Competition and Markets Authority data showing that Shell-owned sites were the most expensive in the UK.

“We remain baffled how the very same fuel can be sold for such vastly different prices by the biggest retailers, whether they’re run by supermarkets or the world’s largest oil companies,” he said.

Rishi Sunak has made lower inflation the cornerstone of the Conservatives’ general election campaign after a return in the official headline rate to the Bank of England’s target of 2% in May, down from a peak of 11.1% in October 2022.

The shadow chancellor, Rachel Reeves, however, has said pressure on household finances remains “acute” as average prices remain significantly higher than before the cost of living crisis took hold.

According to the latest snapshot from the BRC, food inflation slowed to 2.5% in June, down from 3.2% in May, in the 14th consecutive deceleration for annual growth in grocery prices. The figures suggest average prices in UK shops are continuing to rise, albeit at a slower pace than in previous months.

The chief executive of the BRC, Helen Dickinson, said retailers had, however, cut the prices of some key products including butter and coffee. Non-food prices were also in deflation – meaning average prices are falling compared with a year earlier – as shops tried to boost their sales by discounting products.

“This was particularly true for TVs with great deals to capitalise on the Euros fever,” she said. “Whoever wins Thursday’s election will benefit from the work of retailers to cut their costs and prices, easing the cost of living for millions of households.”","Britain’s next government is poised to benefit from easing pressure on household finances after a slowdown in inflation in stores and a fall in fuel prices, but costs remain “too expensive” for many families.
“Fuel prices are still nowhere near where they should be despite falling for the second consecutive month,” the RAC said.

The Guardian,https://www.theguardian.com/world/article/2024/jul/01/greece-introduces-growth-oriented-six-day-working-week,2024-07-01,16:26:54 UTC,Greece introduces ‘growth-oriented’ six-day working week,"Companies in countries worldwide may be toying with the idea of implementing shorter working weeks, but in Greece employees have been told that, henceforth, they can put in a sixth day of labour in an unorthodox step aimed at turbocharging productivity.

After outpacing other Europeans in terms of economic growth, the nation once at the heart of the continent’s worst financial crisis has bucked the trend again, introducing a 48-hour working week. The measure, decried as “barbaric” by unions, takes effect from Monday.

“It makes no sense whatsoever,” said Akis Sotiropoulos an executive committee member of the civil servants’ union Adedy. “When almost every other civilised country is enacting a four-day week, Greece decides to go the other way.”

The pro-business government of the prime minister, Kyriakos Mitsotakis, says the initiative was made necessary by the twin perils of a shrinking population and shortage of skilled workers. Prior to announcing the legislation – part of a broader set of labour laws passed last year – Mitsotakis described the projected demographic shift as a “ticking timebomb”. In an unprecedented exodus, about 500,000 mostly young educated Greeks are estimated to have emigrated since the near decade-long debt crisis erupted in late 2009.

The six-day scheme, officials say, will only apply to private businesses providing round-the-clock services. Under the extended working week, staff in select industries and manufacturing facilities will have the option of working an additional two hours a day or an extra eight-hour shift, rewarded with a top-up fee of 40% added to the daily wage.

Either choice, the centre right government claims, will redress the issue of employees not being paid for overtime while also tackling the pervasive problem of undeclared work.

“The nucleus of this legislation is worker-friendly, it is deeply growth-oriented,” Mitsotakis said before the Greek parliament endorsed the law. “And it brings Greece in line with the rest of Europe.”

But the backlash has been fierce. In a country with almost no tradition of inspections in the workplace, critics contend the reform ultimately sounds the death knell of the five-day working week, not least because it enables employers to dictate whether a sixth day of labour is required.

For opponents, who have already taken to the streets in protest, the reform erodes legal protections and rolls back long-established workers’ rights in the name of flexibility.

“In reality this has been passed by a government ideologically committed to generating ever bigger profits for capital,” said Sotiropoulos. “Better productivity comes with better work conditions, a better quality of life [for employees] and that, we now know, is about less hours not more.”

The measure, he said, had been made possible partly because trade unions had also seen their power wane as a result of debt-stricken Athens enacting austerity measures in return for rescue funds during the country’s financial crisis. Unions have long argued that overtime enables employers to hold back on hiring more staff.

Trialled four-day week programmes have repeatedly shown increased levels of productivity with researchers attributing the outcome to improved levels of focus. Belgium in 2022 legislated to give employees the legal right to spread their working week over four days instead of five, and pilot schemes have been carried out in countries including the UK, Germany, Japan, South Africa and Canada.

Greeks already work the longest hours in Europe, putting in an average 41 hours a week according to the EU’s statistics agency, Eurostat, although surveys have also proved they get paid much less. The left-wing opposition has frequently decried “Bulgarian salaries in a country of British prices”, claiming the phenomenon has only exacerbated the brain drain.

People on pensions, who have also been encouraged to work under the legislation, have weighed into the debate.

“What the government is essentially saying is ‘go and work longer, we’ll turn a blind eye even if you’re a pensioner,’” said Grigoris Kalomoiris who heads the union of retired teachers (Pesek).

“It knows that the majority of Greeks, on an average monthly salary of €900, can only survive until the 20th of the month. This latest barbaric measure is not going to solve the fundamental problem of labour shortages and a lot of us feel it is very unfair to unemployed young Greeks who may never have a job.”","After outpacing other Europeans in terms of economic growth, the nation once at the heart of the continent’s worst financial crisis has bucked the trend again, introducing a 48-hour working week.

The Guardian,https://www.theguardian.com/politics/article/2024/jul/01/nick-hartley-obituary,2024-07-01,15:54:44 UTC,Nick Hartley obituary,"Nick Hartley, who has died aged 80, was a respected economist and in the 1990s served as head of energy, economics and statistics at the Department of Trade and Industry.

His reputation was made as chief economist at Oftel (the Office of Telecommunications) for six years from 1984. He was then chief economist at the Department of the Environment (1990-94), before becoming head of energy, economics and statistics at the DTI, a post, he liked to point out, once held by Harold Wilson. In 1996, Nick joined the economic consultancy Oxera, from where he was seconded to the Cabinet Office to head up a report on energy policy.

Born in London, the only child of Nancy (nee Fulton), a dressmaker, and Edward Hartley, a publican, Nick went to St Clement Danes grammar school, Hammersmith, where he and I met in 1955. Sitting side by side in assembly for the headteacher’s address to the new boys, he introduced himself: “Hello, I’m Hartley, like the jam.”

In the sixth form we were told by our economics teacher, Jack Harvey, to apply to St Catharine’s College, Cambridge, to study economics. We arrived in 1962 during a winter so cold that the River Granta froze, and Nick and I would walk on it to Grantchester.

After graduating, Nick passed the civil service exam and became assistant principal at the Department for Education, where he worked for JAR Pimlott setting up polytechnics (1965-69). From there, he moved to the Treasury as an economic adviser (1969-84). He was seconded from the Treasury twice, in 1970-71 to do an MPhil at York University, and in 1974-77, to the Royal Commission on the Press.

Latterly he was a companion of the Guild of St George, a charity for arts and crafts founded by John Ruskin who, Nick said, “was asking all the right questions about the way work and society should be organised”. Nick travelled throughout Italy with Ruskin’s work in mind, and artistic interests were central to his life.

He wrote several books, including The Prince of Privateers (2012), a life of one of his forebears who was on the British side in the American war of independence, and Monuments Officer (2012), a novel.

An enthusiastic theatregoer, as an undergraduate he played Lucky in a production of Waiting for Godot. After hearing Bob Dylan’s second album in 1962 he became a lifelong fan of the musician. He was also a keen reader of the magazine Cahiers du Cinéma, so after watching a film at Cambridge, whether Hammer horror or Truffaut, he would give notes on “auteur theory”.

The novelist and playwright Nigel Williams described Nick as having a “unique brisk theatricality”. Perfect words with which to preserve my own memories of him, particularly as the briskness often involved the sort of expansive gestures that put any wine glasses on a table at risk.

Nick is survived by Jenny (nee Stern), whom he married in 1975, and by their sons, Ned and Gabriel, and granddaughters, Violet, Hazel and Hana.","Nick Hartley, who has died aged 80, was a respected economist and in the 1990s served as head of energy, economics and statistics at the Department of Trade and Industry.

It was a political choice on the part of George Osborne and David Cameron to advance their class interest, cleverly camouflaged by stories of Labour profligacy when the economic crisis to which it was the alleged response was caused by a surfeit of financial deregulation advocated by Osborne and Cameron and supinely accepted by Labour.

The American political economist Clara E Mattei, in her 2022 book, The Capital Order: How Economists Invented Austerity and Paved the Way to Fascism, showed how similar policies were applied in Britain and Italy after the first world war, essentially to keep workers in their place, and how in Italy they led to the rise of Mussolini and fascism. Let us be warned.

Prof Roger Brown

Paul Krugman is right about the impact of austerity on the UK economy – here are a couple of reasons why. First, those who advocate the shrinking of the state fail to appreciate how the economy is interdependent. Most public authorities require tendering for services. Generally, the private or voluntary sectors get the tender. So if the public sector is starved of finance and catches a cold, the private and voluntary sectors start to sneeze too.

Second, the assumption is that if the public sector is smaller, the private sector will take up the slack. This ignores the fact that the private sector’s bottom line is its profitability and ability to satisfy its shareholders, not the public interest. In practice, this means that the private sector will cherry-pick the easy and profitable tasks, as with the failed privatisation of the probation service, while leaving anything difficult or unprofitable to the public sector.

Alternatively, as with the failed privatisation of the railways, the private sector demands subsidies out of our taxes so that it can pay a dividend to its shareholders, thereby taking money out of the system that could otherwise be used to improve the infrastructure, reduce fares, or both.

Austerity was an ideological choice by the coalition government. While I would have expected little better from the Conservatives, I would have hoped that their Liberal Democrat coalition partners would have drawn enough red lines to prevent the government from following through on its economic illiteracy and choking off the first signs of recovery from the 2007-08 crash. As it is, we’ve suffered from the consequences ever since.

Paul Krugman does an excellent job of exposing the disastrous consequences of 14 years of austerity for both society and the economy. But in solely blaming the Tories, he neglects to acknowledge the role of the Liberal Democrats in both enabling austerity and even co-authoring the genesis of the policy through the key role played by the then chief secretary to the Treasury David Laws.

Although in post for only a short time, his role was pivotal in developing the first drastic cuts in public expenditure. We now live with the consequences of 14 years of monetarist dogma ruthlessly, pitilessly and unfairly applied.

21m ago 14.45 CEST German inflation drops as European Central Bank mulls further rate cuts German inflation has dropped slightly more than expected to 2.2% year-on-year in June, as the European Central Bank (ECB) considers whether to cut interest rates again. It dropped from 2.4% in May, and was slightly lower than the 2.3% forecast. The ECB has a 2% inflation target, but it has cut borrowing costs because it believes that inflationary pressure is easing. A further reduction in inflation could support that view. Carsten Brzeski, global head of macro at ING, a Dutch investment bank, said the reading keeps the door open to further ECB rate cuts, but added that inflation “remains sticky above 2%. He wrote: Looking ahead, the stickiness of inflation at slightly too high a level looks set to continue as favourable energy base effects are petering out while, at the same time, wages are increasing. With recent new wage demands, it is hard to see German wage growth coming down in the second half of the year. Claus Vistesen, chief eurozone economist at Pantheon Macroeconomics, a consultancy, a September cut is likely. He said: said: Looking further ahead for Germany, we see scope for a further decline in headline inflation to below 2% by August, helping to get a 25 basis point rate cut over the line in September, before a rebound to just under 2.5% by the end of the year.

Photograph: Kirill Kudryavtsev/AFP/Getty Images Mark Zuckerberg’s Meta has breached the EU’s new digital laws with an advertising model that charges users for ad-free versions of Facebook and Instagram, according to the European Commission. Meta launched a “pay or consent” model last year in an effort to comply with the bloc’s data privacy rules, where users pay a monthly fee for an ad-free version of Facebook or Instagram that does not use their personal data for advertising purposes, writes the Guardian’s Dan Milmo. Users who do not pay have, as part of the signing up process for the platforms, consented to their data being used to tailor personalised adverts that appear in their social media feeds. The European Commission, the EU’s executive body, said the model does not comply with the Digital Markets Act, which is designed to rein in big tech companies. The commission issued preliminary findings from an investigation into “pay or consent” on Monday and found the model “forces users to consent” to their data being collected from multiple platforms. It also does not allow users to choose a service that uses less of their data but is broadly similar to the “with adverts” versions of Facebook and Instagram, the commission said.

1h ago 13.57 CEST Unite the union has said that Tata Steel will enter talks about “future investment for its operations and not just redundancies”, after suspending strikes. Other unions have complained that there has been no progress in the last six weeks, but Unite suggested that Tata had changed stance. Tata has stuck to its position that the two blast furnaces must close this year. However, a plan backed by counterpart unions Community and GMB suggested keeping one furnace open for longer while readying a large investment in greener technology (such as a direct reduced iron plant) to convert iron ore to iron, which could then be fed into an electric arc furnace. That plan would preserve jobs on the blast furnaces for several years, and would then require more workers to run in the longer term – although nowhere near the 2,800 employees who could be out of work by the autumn.

Photograph: Jacob King/PA Sharon Graham, Unite’s general secretary, said: This is a significant development in the battle to protect jobs and the long-term future of steel making in South Wales. Investment from Labour secured by Unite will be key to the future of the site. This breakthrough would not have come about without the courage of our members at Port Talbot who were prepared to stand up and fight for their jobs. Workers were simply not prepared to stand idly by while steel making ended and their communities were laid to waste. It is essential that these talks progress swiftly and in good faith with the focus on fresh investment and ensuring the long-term continuation of steel making in South Wales. Share

Owner of Port Talbot steelworks offers fresh talks as last furnace faces closure Read more The unions are hopeful that a Labour government would persuade Tata Steel to delay the closure of at least one blast furnace, preserving thousands of jobs for several years. Unite had threatened strike action from 8 July – after the planned closure of the first blast furnace. The other unions were hanging on for a Labour government after 4 July. Shadow business secretary Jonathan Reynolds has already been in talks with the unions and the company in an effort to avert the closures. Alun Davies, national officer for Community, which represents most of the affected steelworkers, said: With thousands of jobs at stake, we welcome Unite’s decision to withdraw their strike action and get back around the table with their sister steel unions. Tata confirmed that if the strike was called off they are ready to resume discussions on a potential [memorandum of understanding], through the multi-union steel committee which is chaired by Community. The truth is Tata never walked away from those discussions, and at our last meeting on 22 May all unions agreed to conclude the negotiations and put the outcome to our members. Community will welcome resuming those discussions, but we regret that zero progress has been made since 22 May. Share

3h ago 12.16 CEST There has been a rush of manufacturing data today. The UK’s purchasing managers’ index (PMI) from S&P Global suggests it is doing better than Europe. The PMI reading came in at 50.9 in June, still well into expansionary territory, in contrast to the two-year contraction in Europe. The reading was worse than the initial flash estimate of 51.4, and down slightly from May’s 22-month high of 51.2. View image in fullscreen Output from the UK manufacturing sector has picked up in recent months. Photograph: S&P Global Rob Dobson, director at S&P Global Market Intelligence, said: The UK manufacturing sector is enjoying its strongest spell of growth for over two years, with June seeing output and new order growth sustained at robust rates similar to May’s recent highs. The performance of the domestic market remains a real positive, providing a ripe source of new contract wins. In contrast, the ongoing weak export performance is concerning, with manufacturers reporting difficulties in securing new business in several key markets including the US, China and mainland Europe. However, that did not stop companies from making job and spending cuts and trying to run down inventories of unsold products, Dobson said. Inflation may be partly behind that: This is coming from a backdrop of renewed cost inflation pressure, with manufacturers’ input prices now rising at the quickest pace since the start of 2023. This renewed upward lurch in manufacturing prices will likely add to concerns over the potential stubbornness of underlying inflationary pressures among hawkish rate setters at the Bank of England.

4h ago 10.56 CEST On the French election, Swiss investment bank UBS said there is uncertainty over what will happen in the second round because of 250+ “triangular votes”, with second rounds contested by three candidates. But the UBS analysts, led by Claudia Panseri, chief investment officer at UBS Wealth Management France, say that “the probability that no majority emerges from the election appears significant”. (And on that basis they tell investors to avoid overreaction in the coming days.) The reach of the French far right will depend in part on whether other parties work together to stop them, UBS said: By 6pm on 2 July, the candidates will need to confirm if they want to enter the second round or withdraw and lend their support to another candidate. It will also be important to see whether the various parties will give explicit guidance to their voters on which candidate to vote for in the second round in constituencies where their own candidate fared less well. Gabriel Attal, France’s prime minister, has called on members of his party who came in third to withdraw in favor of a “candidate who defends the values of the Republic”. For now, the left is calling on its third-placed candidates to withdraw in order to defeat the RN. But either way, a “period of political instability” is very likely, they write in a note to clients. France’s main stock index may have gained this morning, but UBS is cautious about the implications for company share prices, because uncertainty will be the name of the game for at least a week, and possibly longer. They wrote: The poor showing by Macron’s Ensemble alliance in the first round is likely to mean that French and Eurozone equities struggle to recover some of their recent losses.

5h ago 10.25 CEST Holger Schmieding, chief economist at Berenberg, a German investment bank, said the French election result was “not worse than expected”. Marine Le Pen’s National Rally (RN) and its allies received 33% of the national popular vote, with the leftwing New Popular Front in second with 28%. President Emmanuel Macron’s centrist bloc was third on 20% of the vote. Schmieding said RN’s vote share was two points below opinion polling, meaning “a hung parliament remains the most likely outcome”. RN could still win an absolute majority in the second round on Sunday 7 July, but that “now looks even slightly less likely than it did before”, he wrote in a note to clients. He also noted that the possibility that the leftwing coalition could “take power and implement its costly agenda seems to have receded further”. (Investors have generally not been in favour of the potentially free-spending leftwing coalition.) Schmieding sketches out three scenarios (quoted here in full): Gridlock: The most likely outcome remains a hung parliament in which neither the far right nor the united left nor the Macron’s centrists can muster a majority. In this case, any (new) government would not get much done. Worse than gridlock: Although the united left and RN are polar opposites on issues of migration, culture and identity, they have all opposed Macron’s pro-growth reforms. As a result, we see a risk that Le Pen’s party and parts of the left may still join forces in a hung parliament on a few select issues to soften Macron’s pension reform and enhance the “purchasing power” of citizens, for instance through lower VAT on energy products or via additional subsidies. Marine Meloni: With a significantly lower probability than the first two scenarios, Le Pen’s party may still win a majority of seats and install RN boss Jordan Bardella as prime minister. If so, she would probably focus on winning the 2027 presidential election, staying on the more moderate track which she has signalled during the campaign. She may concentrate on some signature policies (e.g. being tough on immigration) rather than on expensive or disruptive fiscal promises. Put differently, Le Pen may try to largely follow the example of Italy’s prime minister Giorgia Meloni. To do so, she may possibly explain to RN voters after a lengthy fiscal review that most of her original fiscal ideas could only be implemented slowly over time – or only if she became president in 2027. Schmieding sees “a change for the worse” after Macron’s “pro-growth economic reforms”. He thinks they will mean higher spending relative to government income, plus a much more combative relationship with the EU. Share Updated at 10.28 CEST

5h ago 10.10 CEST Back on the French election fall-out, let’s look at what economists have had to say this morning. Marine Le Pen, leader of the victorious National Rally, formerly called for France to leave the euro currency and the EU. She has done her best to distance herself from any anti-euro sentiments in recent times, realising they are unpopular with people whose savings are in euros, but concerns over the future of Europe have been a major part of investor concerns over a far-right government. A hung parliament – as indicated by the first round of voting – would assuage some of those concerns. However, it could also stop Macron from making changes such as pension reforms that might boost economic growth, but which have proven unpopular with voters. Mohit Kumar, chief economist of Jefferies investment bank, said: The result is probably better-than-feared, but not as good as the status three weeks ago pre-elections. We could still be looking at the next few years of political paralysis in France with a stalling of the reform process. However, any fears of Frexit or a euro area breakup would be unfounded. Share

5h ago 10.07 CEST Two-year recession for European manufacturing sector Output from Europe’s manufacturing sector dropped in June as Germany’s economy continued to struggle, according to a closely followed index. That marked two years of contraction for the sector. The purchasing managers’ index (PMI) for the eurozone dropped from 47.3 points in May to 45.8 in June, according to S&P Global. Germany’s enormous manufacturing sector is usually the powerhouse of Europe, but it has now been in contractionary territory for two years, according to the PMI reading. The latest Germany reading for June came in at 43.5, a marked drop from May’s 45.4 reading. That was marginally better than expectations, but remains well below the 50-point mark that denotes expansion. Cyrus de la Rubia, chief economist at Hamburg Commercial Bank, said: We are inclined to see this more as a temporary blip rather than a sign of a prolonged downturn. Manufacturing growth was seen in other parts of the world in June, such as the United States, UK, and India, according to their respective Flash PMI. This global recovery provides a supportive backdrop for Eurozone manufacturers. Additionally, optimism about future production remains as high as it was in May, indicating that businesses are still confident about the coming year. Share

5h ago 09.51 CEST UK house price rises pick up pace slightly in June View image in fullscreen An aerial view of the residential properties in London, in April. Photograph: Anadolu/Getty Images UK house prices rose by 1.5% in the year to June, a slight acceleration compared to 1.3% in the year to May, according to lender Nationwide. During June prices rose by 0.2% to an average of £266,604. The relatively slow pace of increases – certainly compared to the run of the last decade – is mostly down to higher interest rates, according to Robert Gardner, Nationwide’s chief economist. He said: Housing market activity has been broadly flat over the last year, with the total number of transactions down by around 15% compared with 2019 levels. Transactions involving a mortgage are down even more (nearly 25%), reflecting the impact of higher borrowing costs. By contrast, the volume of cash transactions is actually around 5% above pre-pandemic levels. While earnings growth has been much stronger than house price growth in recent years, this hasn’t been enough to offset the impact of higher mortgage rates, which are still well above the record lows prevailing in 2021 in the wake of the pandemic. The biggest price increases were in Northern Ireland, up 4.1% compared with the second quarter of 2023. Across England overall, prices were up 0.6% year-on-year, while Wales and Scotland both saw a 1.4% year-on-year rise. Prices fell 0.3% across southern England in the second quarter compared to a year earlier. Share

Airbus will take over manufacturer of fuselage sections for the A350 jet in Kinston, North Carolina, and St Nazaire, France, A220 pylons in Wichita, Kansas, and of the A220’s wings and mid-fuselage in Belfast, Northern Ireland, and Casablanca, Morocco. Boeing chief executive Dave Calhoun, who retires later this year, said: We believe this deal is in the best interest of the flying public, our airline customers, the employees of Spirit and Boeing, our shareholders and the country more broadly.

The Guardian,https://www.theguardian.com/business/article/2024/jul/01/london-investment-bankers-bonuses-interest-rates,2024-07-01,05:00:44 UTC,London investment bankers to rake in bigger bonuses after two-year slump,"London’s investment bankers are expected to rake in bigger bonuses this financial year, as the City begins to recover from a two-year slump in deals caused by surging interest rates.

Demand for investment banking services – such as facilitating mergers and acquisitions, advising companies and governments on fundraising, and underwriting new stock and bonds – was hit by a sharp increase in borrowing rates after the pandemic, as central banks acted to tame runaway inflation. Jobs and pay were cut as investment banks sought to reduce costs.

But the rate hike cycle has ended, with the UK and US expected to begin reducing the cost of borrowing before Christmas. Forecasters say the recent increase in dealmaking is likely to be felt during the spring bonus season.

“The outlook for 2024 is brightening after a promising first quarter and there are signs of capital markets activity thawing after a two-year freeze,” Dartmouth Partners, a recruiter for banks, consulting firms and startups, said in its annual compensation survey covering London investment bankers.

That is likely to mean bigger bonuses for investment bankers at the London offices of “bulge bracket” firms including JP Morgan, Goldman Sachs, and Deutsche Bank, rewarding those who managed to keep their jobs and wait out nearly two years of falling payouts.

“It feels like there’s more of a an upswing happening,” the Dartmouth Partners founder, Logan Naidu, told the Guardian. “Even if the revenue is not quite there, the activity is and I would suspect that compensation would go up on last year. Will it be back up to where it was in 2021-22? I doubt it is going to be that good. But I think it will be better than than last year.”

Naidu said the UK’s decision to scrap the banker bonus cap, which previously limited bonuses to 100% of salaries, would probably mean that salary rises could be replaced with larger bonuses over the long term. “What might happen is base pay starts to get a bit more suppressed, and variable comp starts to become a larger part of the narrative again, which is probably good news for the banks in terms of how they manage their cost base.”

There is still time for most investment bankers to build their bonus pots. While junior analysts will be paid out at the end of the summer, bonus decisions for higher-level staff will be made at the end of the year.

Dartmouth Partners released data showing average pay tumbled last year across most investment banking positions at eight of the major investment banks, ranging from junior-level analysts to more senior associates and vice-president roles.

While lower-paid analysts took home bonuses worth an average of £44,267 in 2023 – marking a near 50% increase compared with a year earlier – mid-tier associates’ bonus payouts fell by nearly a fifth to £80,065 on average, sending their total pay down 8.3% to £213,940.

Meanwhile, some vice-presidents had their bonuses slashed by 22% to £135,183, reducing total average pay by 11.8% to £303,204.

The survey, which interviewed more than 250 London-based bankers – working at Goldman Sachs, JP Morgan, UBS, Barclays, Morgan Stanley, Citi, Deutsche Bank and Bank of America – found that a number of bankers working at European firms were hoping to jump ship to their American rivals, which tend to offer higher overall compensation.

But even Goldman Sachs cut pay for its vice-presidents by 7.6% on average, while its associates were hit by an 8.3% drop. JP Morgan vice-presidents experienced a 7% cut and associate pay fell by 4.6%.

London-based vice-presidents at Morgan Stanley were hit by the largest drop in total pay on average last year, with it falling nearly by 26.8%, followed by Bank of America where vice-president-level pay fell 23.5%.

Global banks collectively cut more than than 600,000 jobs in 2023, making it one of the biggest years for redundancies since the 2007-08 financial crisis.

“Even though bonuses have been poor, many bankers said they are happy to still have a job,” the survey said.

Agustín Carstens, the general manager of the Bank for International Settlements (BIS), said the world economy was on course for a “smooth landing” from the inflation crisis, but he warned that policymakers, especially politicians, needed to be careful.

Global government debt is already at record levels and elections ranging from the US presidential vote in November, to recent polls in Mexico and South Africa, and votes in France and Britain in the coming week, all carry risks.

Emmanuel Macron’s decision to call a snap election in France has sent the country’s bank stocks crashing and alarmed the bond markets, exacerbating fiscal sustainability concerns in the eurozone’s second-largest economy.

Polls released before the first round of voting on Sunday suggested the far right could win the largest share of the vote, amid record turnout.

Carstens said the BIS was not calling out any “one or two” governments but that the message was clear.

“They [governments] must cut short the rise in public debt and accept that interest rates may not return to the pre-pandemic ultra-low levels,” he said. “We need a solid foundation to build upon.”

With interest rates not about to go back to ultra-low levels, and cost pressures from ageing populations, climate breakdown and rebuilding defence capabilities, economic stimulus plans and a general rise in protectionism could unsettle sensitive markets, BIS warned as it published its annual report.

“They can surprise you with not much notice,” Carstens told reporters, pointing to the turbulence in Britain’s markets after then prime minister Liz Truss’s budget plans, which put some pension funds at risk of collapse. “You really want to avoid that.”

France’s main parties have all promised new spending. Macron’s government had promised to cut the budget deficit from 5.5% of gross domestic product last year to a European Union ceiling of 3% by 2027 – an objective that may be unattainable after the vote, which concludes with a second round on 7 July.

If it forms a government, Marine Le Pen’s National Rally (RN) wants to cut value-added tax (VAT) on energy, which it says would cost €7bn (£5.9bn) for the rest of this year and €12bn in a full year. The RN would also scrap a 2023 increase in the retirement age to 64 from 62, and says its spending plans would be paid for by cutting contributions to the EU budget.

The left-wing New Popular Front alliance, now polling second, says its first moves would include a 10% civil servant pay hike, providing free school lunches, supplies and transport while raising housing subsidies by 10%.

The turmoil has sent the cost to the French government of servicing its debt on the international markets rocketing, with the risk premium, or spread, demanded by holders of French debt over Germany’s rising to its highest level since 2012.

France’s blue-chip CAC 40 index is down 6% since Macron dissolved parliament, with French banks having been among the biggest losers. The big three – Société Générale, BNP Paribas and Crédit Agricole – are down 10%-14% since Macron’s announcement.

French banks have a large amount of debt and are expected to suffer if credit costs increase sharply.

The positive for Carstens was that central banks have successfully reined in inflation, which had hit decades-long highs after the Covid-19 pandemic, and then Russia’s 2022 invasion of Ukraine, which riled commodity markets.

“Compared to last year, I have to say we are in a much better place,” the former Mexican central bank governor said.

Although Carstens said central banks deserved praise for navigating a difficult path that could have resulted in a wave of recessions, he added that they needed to persevere, likening the inflation fight to a course of antibiotics to tackle an illness.

He described an “extreme” scenario where inflation raced up again and central banks needed to raise rates further. But that is not what the BIS expects.","Rising government debt levels could disturb global financial markets, the head of the body that advises central banks said on Sunday before France’s high-stakes parliamentary elections.

The Guardian,https://www.theguardian.com/business/article/2024/jun/30/unusual-economic-indicators,2024-06-30,11:00:20 UTC,What can lipstick and underwear sales tell us about the economy?,"Is the country heading towards a recession? Ask 10 economists and you’ll likely get 10 different answers. Which is why some people have given up on the traditional data – GDP, jobs, etc – and have instead recently been tinkering with more unusual economic indicators to help them guide their companies. Here are a few that I’ve seen.

Uniform patches

One known economic indicator is jobs and for that we tend to rely on unemployment numbers from the Bureau of Labor Statistics. But maybe there’s something better. Like the number of uniform patches sold each year. Uniform patches? Yes, those are the emblems that go on the uniforms worn by millions of workers, from fast food cashiers to drywall contractors. The financial data of one of the world’s largest makers of emblems and patches – privately held World Emblem – can’t be easily obtained. But the company’s owner recently told USA Today that sales are up 19% from the same period last year. A recession? “We’re not seeing it,” says Randy Carr, CEO of the Fort Lauderdale, Florida-based company. “It’s hard to believe there would be.”

Men’s underwear

Ask any guy about underwear, and they’ll usually admit the same thing. When times are good, we’re buying the good material. When money’s tight, we’re wearing those things until they literally fall off. So do men’s underwear sales mirror the economy overall? Some – including former Federal Reserve chief Alan Greenspan – think so. If you want to check out how the men’s underwear business is doing you can look at Hanesbrands or PVH Corp (which owns several leading brands, including Calvin Klein and Tommy Hilfiger) or Ralph Lauren Corporation. “Bottom” line: men’s underwear sales have been mostly flat over the past 12 months.

Lipstick

For the most part, lipstick is a relatively inexpensive accessory, with a typical tube costing anywhere from $5 to $20. History has shown that women will cut back on more expensive beauty goods like makeup and perfume when times are tight. But lipstick? Don’t even go there. When lipstick sales increase as luxury beauty item accessories decrease, that’s another potential sign of economic headwinds. Where to research lipstick sales? Try the big cosmetics companies like L’Oreal, Estee Lauder and Ulta Beauty. All three companies have shown strong revenue gains over the past year.

Overseas freight

World shipping has a significant impact on our economy and instead of tracking units and cargo activity, some economists instead track the price of freight. Why? Because in a supply and demand world, the greater the demand for shipping, the more freight should cost. To track this phenomena, look no further than the Baltic Dry Index. This is a well-watched measure of freight costs for shipping items across the Baltic Sea, one of the world’s busiest shipping lanes. So how are freight costs doing? They’re up more than 55% over the past year and even slightly higher than pre-Covid times.

Recreational vehicles

If you’ve never taken a trip in a recreational vehicle (RV), you’re missing out. It’s fun and a great way to explore our national parks. Some economists think that RV sales are an economic indicator because RVs – a luxury item - are not only expensive to buy, but they come with high maintenance costs and tend to calculate gas usage by gallons per mile. So how’s the RV industry doing? Judging by one of America’s largest makers of these vehicles – Winnebago – not so great. Sales have been declining for the past few years and the company’s stock price has fallen 35% in the past year.

I’m only scratching the surface on unusual economic indicators. Besides RVs you can follow the sales of champagne. Instead of men’s underwear you can also track women’s hemlines (which are believed to rise and fall along with the stock market). You can dig into the buttered popcorn index (which some say increases during times of recession as a small bit of a luxury in an otherwise cruel world). You can even keep track of hairstyles in Japan, where some say that women wear their hair longer when times are good and shorter when times are tough. Good luck finding this data, let alone making any sense of it.

Goofy economic metrics like these are fun to talk about with your friends and colleagues. But they shouldn’t be taken seriously. I run a business, and my go-to economic indicator is my clients. I’ve learned that the best way to insulate my business from the economy is to diversify: have as many clients in as many industries and geographic locations as possible. The US is a big country, and even when one client is cutting back on his underwear purchases in Illinois, I’ll likely have another buying uniform emblems in Texas. Focus on this instead of lipstick.","So do men’s underwear sales mirror the economy overall?

Assuming the polls are right – and they have been consistent since the start of the campaign – the Tories will do worse even than in 1906, their previous nadir. Back then, the Conservatives and their Liberal Unionist allies won just 156 seats, a repeat of which on Thursday would now be considered a good result.

But in 1906, Arthur Balfour’s outgoing government secured more than 43% of the vote, while Rishi Sunak is polling at about half that level. And Balfour’s defeat could at least be attributed to a policy issue – free trade versus protectionism. Today, voters just seem sick of the Tories.

News on the economy since the election was called has had little or no impact on the polls. In part, that’s because the signals have been mixed: inflation fell back to its 2% target and growth in the first quarter of 2024 has been revised up, but the economy stagnated in April and unemployment has increased.

Living standards are certainly improving. The Resolution Foundation thinktank calculates that real per capita household disposable income – a guide to whether people are getting better off after inflation is taken into account – rose by 2.4% over the past year.

That’s the good news. The bad news is that over the 2019-24 parliament as a whole, living standards fell by 0.6% and one of the unwritten rules of political economy is that governments don’t remain popular when voters are getting poorer.

Only twice in the past century have living standards been lower at the end of a parliament than when it commenced: in 1918-22, when the UK suffered from a post-first world war boom-bust, and in the short parliament of 1950-51, when inflation rose sharply as a result of the rearmament programme for the Korean war.

In the inevitable postmortem examination that will follow the election, attention will focus on whether the Tories might have done better had Sunak delayed the election so that in time more voters would have come to think an economic corner genuinely had been turned. Another quarter or two of rising living standards would not have saved the Conservatives from defeat but it would probably have limited the scale of it.

As it is, Rachel Reeves will be the beneficiary. Analysts have been revising up their growth estimates for 2024 and 2025 on the basis that consumers will start to run down the precautionary savings they accumulated during the cost of living crisis.

Other recent developments – especially those overseas – are not so welcome. Joe Biden’s poor performance in his head to head debate with Donald Trump has made it more likely that the latter will win the US presidential election. Tariffs will be raised and taxes will be cut if that happens, threatening higher inflation and rising debt.

Meanwhile, the first round of voting in France’s parliamentary election looks set to show sizeable gains for Marine Le Pen’s rightwing National Rally party and a defeat for Emmanuel Macron’s centrist government.

Events in both the US and France highlight how things have changed in the near decade and a half since Labour was last in power.

Most obviously, the world has become a less safe place. The war between Ukraine and Russia is now well into its third year and has shattered the notion that permanent peace can be guaranteed for western developed nations. There are always demands for Labour governments to spend more on the NHS and on the welfare state. This time there will also be pressure to raise defence spending.

Globalisation has gone into retreat. Weak growth since the financial crisis of 2008-09 has seen a marked increase in protectionist measures – not just on goods but on people too. In Europe, North America and Australasia alike there have been demands for governments to restrict the number of foreign nationals entering the country.

What’s more, multilateral bodies are for the most part weaker than they were in 2010. The increasingly fractious relationship between the US and China means the G20 group of leading developed and developing nations cannot agree on much. The World Trade Organization is a much-diminished institution, unable to fulfil either of its core functions: to negotiate multilateral trade deals and be the final arbiter in trade disputes. The EU is having to contend with rising nationalist sentiment, a function of feeble economic performance and a reaction against rule by unelected technocrats.

The developing world has been even harder hit by Covid and the cost of living crisis than the rich west, increasing the incentive for migrants to look for a better life elsewhere. Yet aid budgets have been cut and promises to help poor countries cope with the impact of climate change have not been fulfilled. The world is getting hotter and the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank urgently need more money to meet demands for their assistance.

So those are the sort of challenges that Labour will face when it takes office later this week. Not the world of 1997, when Russia was seen as an ally rather than a strategic threat. Not the middle of the Great Moderation – the period between the fall of communism and the global financial crisis – when the west enjoyed year after year of growth and low inflation, but rather a world still trying to claw its way out of the Great Stagnation of the past 15 years.

And an angrier world where voters can quickly turn on their governments. Labour should enjoy its honeymoon period. It might not last long.","And Balfour’s defeat could at least be attributed to a policy issue – free trade versus protectionism.

The Guardian,https://www.theguardian.com/business/article/2024/jun/30/the-baby-bust-how-britains-falling-birthrate-is-creating-alarm-in-the-economy,2024-06-30,10:00:21 UTC,The baby bust: how Britain’s falling birthrate is creating alarm in the economy,"Having children has become an unaffordable luxury for many of her generation, says Vanessa, a 35-year-old project manager living in Brighton.

“My friends who managed to start a family, without exception, all received large sums of money from their parents to get on the property ladder. For those of us not fortunate enough, we are trapped in the rental market, largely with insecure, poorly paid employment.”

Vanessa’s outlook is also clouded by concerns about the climate crisis, crumbling public services and the “plummeting mental health of young people”, she says. “Put these into the mix and you have a perfect storm for declining birthrates.”

Her decision is replicated worldwide. The number of women of child-bearing age is in long-term decline across Europe, parts of Asia, South America and the US, a situation made worse by the steep drop in the number of women, and their partners, who either want or are able to have children.

These factors have led to a sharp fall in fertility rates – the number of children born to each woman.

While the issues facing governments from rapidly ageing populations are relatively familiar, a decline in fertility rates that was once limited to Japan has spread across the world. Today, almost every continent has a growing age-dependency ratio as average birthrates fall and people live longer. If the global population hits 10.4 billion in the 2080s as predicted, it will only be because sub-Saharan Africa has continued on its current trend, pushing the population across the African continent from about 1.5 billion to as many as 2.5 billion.

Here we look at the trends, and the implications for future governments, of a demographic revolution.

How the UK is affected

The total fertility rate across England and Wales fell to 1.49 children per woman in 2022, from 1.55 in 2021, according to the Office for National Statistics (ONS).

As a benchmark, the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) says that to maintain a population, the “replacement rate”, often known as the “R-rate”, needs to be at least 2.1 children per woman.

It has been well documented that the pandemic, rather than spark a baby boom, had the reverse effect. Yet the recent drop in fertility has shocked demographers. The rate was already declining, starting in 2010: then came Covid-19, the Russian invasion of Ukraine and a deepening of the climate crisis, which all appeared to add a further downward shift, taking the fertility rate to the lowest since comparative data began being kept in the 1930s.

Ann Berrington, a professor of demography and social statistics at Southampton University, says: “The Human Fertility Database covering England and Wales documents the 1960s baby boom, 1970s baby bust, the fluctuations of the 1980s and 1990s that kept things fairly stable, increases through 2000s to 2010, and then a decline to the historical low levels seen today.”

The trend in Scotland follows the same pattern, but on a lower trajectory during each period over the last 60 years. Northern Ireland follows the same pattern on a slightly elevated path. ONS figures tracking live births tell the same story of decline. They show 605,479 in England and Wales in 2022, a 3.1% fall from 2021 and the lowest number since 2002.

This figure is not an all-time low because the UK’s population has been expanding since 2003, when the UK embraced the free movement of people from countries that had recently joined the EU. Opening its doors to workers from eastern Europe resulted in an increase in total births, and maintained fertility rates, which were about the same for UK-born and foreign-born women at the time.

But when record numbers of women are reaching the age of 30 child-free, the effect has clearly waned.

According to the latest data, half of women born in 1990 were childless by their 30th birthday – the first generation for which that is true.

It’s the economy …

When the Observer asked readers, including Vanessa, to say why they had not had children, or had restricted the size of their family, most replied that financial constraints were the main reason.

Hannah, a 35-year-old marketing executive living in London, says she had been unable to have the two children she wanted with her partner of 10 years, despite moving to a cheaper area to secure a bigger home.

Childcare costs were prohibitively high, along with other costs of living, she says. “The family we want to have is financially out of reach. We have only ever had one holiday together since our relationship began. We are cutting down on food bills and looking for extra work to make having a child happen.” She and her partner are considering moving abroad.

In the early 00s, Britain and France were outliers in Europe. Both countries had generous family benefits and governments with a stated aim of supporting children. The scale of generosity, from tax credits for low earners to an expansion of early years centres and childcare subsidies, meant both countries – under Labour in the UK and the Gaullist centre-right in France – arrested declines over previous decades.

In the UK and France, these subsidies were scaled back after the recessions of 2008-09. Austerity across all public services was the message from Nicolas Sarkozy, France’s president from 2007 to 2012, and from the UK ’s coalition government from 2010 to 2015.

For all the impact of welfare and public service cuts, a study by Fathom Consulting indicates those interested in creating a family look further ahead. In the aftermath of the financial crash of 2008, it was clear the future for many households looked bleak, with incomes flat and costs, especially housing, on a steady incline. Without the optimism of previous generations, couples decided not to have children, according to the initial findings from a study of Japan that links declines in fertility with periods when the future outlook for the economy was uncertain.

“It turns out that there is a good relationship between forecasts of 15-year forward growth in Japan at any point in time and the fertility rate in Japan at the same point in time,” says the report.

“In other words, people have kids when they feel optimistic that, when their kids join the workforce, the standard of living they will enjoy will be better than it is now.”

To measure growth, the report used national income per capita, which has improved in Japan while the overall economy has stagnated. Japan’s fertility rate is 1.3, just ahead of Italy’s 1.2 and South Korea’s 0.8.

The consultancy’s director, Erik Britton, says the research is ongoing and the conclusions only tentative, but the initial findings reveal that government support, while a necessary element, might not be the most important factor. A nation confidently growing its economy is the comfort people need before starting a family, he says.

… but also other factors

Recent data from the UK Generations and Gender Survey tells us that the ideal family size remains relatively high, with an average of about two children. There remains evidence of a two-child family ideal.

Berrington says that when her team asked childless people whether they intend to have children, there was “a lot of uncertainty in the answers”. Higher proportions of young adults said they probably or definitely would not have children, as compared with the proportions reported by millennials at a similar age.

Fiona Powley, 49, a life coach, knew she did not want children by the age of 12, and knows many contemporaries who also prefer to be child-free; she runs the group Bristol Childfree Women. As an indication of the problem faced by any government seeking to boost fertility, she says that when she asks people as they join her community what they enjoy most about being child-free, “they talk about time and freedom: finances don’t usually feature”.

She adds: “A common judgment from others asks ‘who will look after you when you’re old?’, to which most members might say they’ve made good financial provision for older-age care and pensions as they’ve not have the financial strain of children.”

Sarah Harper, a professor of gerontology at Oxford University, says one of the main issues is equality, meaning equal treatment by the state and within a relationship.

It is only when women believe they can continue working and have spare time that they will take the plunge into motherhood, she says – though the evidence from the Nordic countries, where fertility rates have followed the general downward trend, is weak. However, it might explain why traditional South Korea’s fertility rate is so low.

“These days women say they have no obligation to reproduce and ‘I’m not going to have a baby who turns my life upside down’,” says Harper, who advised the David Cameron’s government on the implications of an ageing society.

Public services

The Treasury’s independent forecaster, the Office for Budget Responsibility (OBR), says falling birthrates are going to have a negative effect on tax receipts. That is a situation that is not necessarily solved by higher immigration.

In a recent report, it said that while every additional migrant generally boosts the level of output in the economy, “the size of this impact and the effect on per-person living standards is highly uncertain.

“The age, education, skill level, and participation rate of migrants, alongside the investment response of businesses, are all factors that determine the impact of migration on per-person output,” it said.

At the moment, the UK population is increasing – by an estimated 6.6 million to 73.7 million over the next 15 years – but the economy is on course to grow at a slower pace, meaning there is less of the financial pie to go around.

Without a healthy rise in tax receipts, governments will struggle to pay for vital services.

Schools are in the frontline of cuts as pupil numbers decline, according to the Resolution Foundation. In England, they could lose up to £1bn in funding by 2030, with exceptional falls in pupil numbers prompting closures as some establishments cease to be financially viable. Councils across the country have begun to consult local residents about mergers and closures to make the system viable.

According to the Education Policy Institute (EPI), a thinktank, the north-east is projected to see the greatest decline in primary pupil numbers, down 13% by 2028-29.

Primary school teachers could face redundancy, such is the dramatic loss of young children, says Lindsey Macmillan, an education policy expert at University College London. She says secondary schools that are now suffering teacher shortages will see the gap close as classes are cut and schools merged.

Pupil numbers had grown because of a fertility surge in the 00s, but that cohort has moved through primary and on to secondaries, leaving empty seats in their wake.

Looking ahead, even with real terms increases in per-pupil funding over the remainder of the decade, the EPI predicts that many schools will suffer funding cuts due to fewer pupils causing income to fall, though costs will remain high.

What about ageing?

Plenty of questions arise over the fact that the birthrate is falling while medical improvements are helping older people live longer. Will robots be able to look after elderly people? Could a new social contract between young and old give millennials and gen Z the security and encouragement they need to have more children? And can the UK import all the missing labour it needs, such as from sub-Saharan Africa, where births are expected to be higher?

Nik Lomax, a professor of population geography at Leeds University, says one problem faced by the next government will be how different regions are affected.

“One way of thinking about the implications of this is to assess the old-age dependency ratio – the number of people of retirement age for every 1,000 people of working age,” he says. “This reveals striking differences by geography, and will get larger over time as the number of old people relative to working age people increases.”

Just as fertility rates are falling fastest in the north-east, Wales, the south-west and parts of the Midlands, the dependency ratio is increasing in these regions too.

Harper says a clear trend shows fewer people entering the workforce and older people living longer, and not necessarily in good health.

“Men in areas that rank in the lowest third by average incomes will live until they are 80, but spend their 70s in ill health,” she says. “Men who live in the top third of affluent areas will live until their late 80s and won’t be ill or have a disability, on average, until they are 80.”

Harper says the Cameron government put ageing into its industrial strategy and considered many of the implications of falling birthrates and rising levels of ill health among a growing number of over-65s. But the industrial strategy and policy initiatives were later jettisoned.

Given that we are not going to change the dynamics of fertility rates and have women go back to producing three to four children, we need to extend people’s lives in a healthy way, Harper says.

Berrington says the implications for policymaking are “very significant – for example, the short-term decline in demand for childcare, maternity services and other parts of the economy that depend on people buying goods and services for children. “Policy responses to low fertility have tended to focus on ways to increase fertility,” she says. “However, many pronatalist policies do not work, especially cash benefits, as they tend to just bring forward in time births that would happen anyway, and not increase the overall number of births.”

Pronatalist policies – those that attempt to boost the birthrate – are also often problematic in terms of entrenching gender inequality and reducing reproductive freedom.

A report by the Social Market Foundation thinktank in 2021 said the tens of billions of pounds it would take to support an expansion of family welfare could be better spent. “We do not recommend that the government pursues a distinct ‘population strategy’ to increase the birthrate. However, the government should convene a cross-departmental working group to examine how different policies affect the birthrate,” it said.

Berrington says healthy ageing is crucial to the prospects for the economy, providing more workers and helping fill the state’s coffers.

“And governments will need to look to other policy solutions, such as increasing employment among groups which for different reasons – poor mental wellbeing, or because they have young children – have relatively high inactivity rates.”","These factors have led to a sharp fall in fertility rates – the number of children born to each woman.

The Guardian,https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/article/2024/jun/30/labour-needs-billions-to-fund-its-plans-and-i-know-where-it-can-be-found,2024-06-30,08:00:16 UTC,Labour needs billions to fund its plans – and I know where it can be found | Will Hutton,"Since its foundation in 1900, the Labour party has had a Janus-headed attitude to capitalism. It needs capitalism to be successful, dynamic and job creating, even while it instinctively distrusts capitalism, with its capacity to generate extreme inequality, invest too little, cut corners and treat workers exploitatively. But its past efforts at improving things – nationalisation, top-down planning, championing strong trade unions or simply (as New Labour did) largely giving capitalism its head – have not been notably successful. It has been a standoff that the Conservative party has ruthlessly exploited.

The seismic importance of 4 July is that Conservatism’s approach to wealth generation – trying to shrink the state whose size and excess taxes supposedly “crowds out” suppressed investment and enterprise – is exposed as a dead end of stagnant living standards and eviscerated public services. Keir Starmer, boxed in by this dreadful legacy, has declared that Labour will become the party of growth and wealth generation. Only thus can sustained tax revenues be generated to repair the ravages of the past 14 years. My bet is that he has a better than even chance of pulling it off – and transforming Labour into Britain’s natural party of government.

His first advantage is that the economic evidence is unambiguous: the state does not “crowd out” investment, and low taxes do little to stimulate enterprise. What capitalism needs from the state is well-designed and stable policy that proactively manages the business cycle while “crowding in” innovation, infrastructure and abundant fit-for-purpose training, and shapes the savings system to deliver buoyant company share prices – the necessary if insufficient precondition for raising capital to enable higher investment and a startup and scale-up boom.

This is becoming the new common sense in business, finance and the financial markets. It is why investors are buying shares anticipating a Labour government, and why Dame Amanda Blanc, CEO of Aviva, suggested last week that there could be as much as £100bn from UK insurers ready to flow into business investment if chancellor Rachel Reeves can deliver her promises on stability. That alone would go some way to lift British public and private investment by £100bn every year – the scale of the gap between us and our major competitors – while not risking another Liz Truss-style fiasco.

One important avenue to growth, cited in the Labour manifesto, is the prospect of unleashing some of the £1.4tn funds fossilised in Britain’s 5,100 defined benefit pension fund schemes. Linked to a generous fraction of workers’ final year’s pay, they have become a financial burden. To wind them up, companies have closed them to new members, creating a £1.4tn universe of wholly risk-averse zombie funds. They need to be consolidated into bigger funds that can take risks – and the money made to work to accelerate Britain’s investment recovery.

There is the tool to hand. One of the most startling policy successes of the past 20 years has been New Labour’s Pension Protection Fund (PPF), established in 2005, which takes over the management of distressed defined benefit pension funds, guaranteeing the future pensions. Managed with great professionalism, the PPF has already consolidated more than 1,100 pension funds and is currently worth £33bn with a £12bn investment surplus – one of the most successful funds of its type globally in securing high investment performance. Industry insiders believe that there is another £600bn locked up in small, high-cost zombie funds that could be liberated for productive investment.

The first staging post would be to scale up the current PPF to at least £100bn. Conservative objections that this would leave the pension funds with no fiscal backstop can be easily overcome; backed by the state, the PPF will become the new backstop via a guarantee that does not score as public borrowing. Nor, because the PPF is so rich, would the state ever be at risk. Reeves will be on her way.

Britain would have an investment trio of financial institutions dedicated to multibillion-pound economic development

After all, such a guarantee is already delegated to the UK Infrastructure Bank (UKIB) to underwrite £10bn of commercial bank lending on infrastructure projects. Reeves should lift the facility to £50bn. A similar guarantee would enable the British Business Bank (BBB) to offer venture debt to startups and scale-ups, and seek out promising companies to back: there is an estimated annual shortage of up to £10bn of venture lending that needs to be closed. My understanding is that a scaled-up PPF would support both the UKIB and BBB; at a stroke, Britain would have equipped itself with an investment trio of financial institutions dedicated to serious multibillion-pound economic development and resultant growth – without additional direct government borrowing. It’s a fiscal get-out-of-jail-free card.

Against this background, Reeves can use her proposed rewriting of the fiscal rules to supplement public investment directly. The Financial Times recently reported that asset managers would buy an extra £20bn-£30bn of government debt if it were earmarked for investment projects and R&D. Altogether, the UK’s growth rate could accelerate to above 2.5% by the end of the parliament, with even the dropped £28bn target for green spending met. Growth would be higher again the more Britain regained access to lost EU markets.

In the near future, before growth kicks in, Starmer and Reeves may have to increase the current yields from capital gains, inheritance and council tax by up to another 1% of GDP. But overall there will be the funds to resuscitate education, the NHS, local government, defence, the criminal justice system, the arts and welfare. Do I dream? Some commitments are in the manifesto, others set out in Reeves’ Mais lecture in March, others have not been excluded during the election campaign, and the ambitious teams in the investment trio are all standing by for the call.

Some in the Treasury will oppose. And never underestimate the conservatism and parochialism of the pension fund world. Geopolitics may kill all hopes. But Britain under Labour could at last fulfil its economic promise and build a high-investment, inclusive, high-wage capitalism that treats its workers fairly. This time, no mistakes.","Since its foundation in 1900, the Labour party has had a Janus-headed attitude to capitalism.

Tory messaging has become ever more bizarre as this gaffe-strewn campaign lurches towards a close, but Thursday’s example, warning that Labour may make the UK’s labour market un peu French, hit new heights of weirdness.

For one thing, the mention of France seems more likely to evoke pleasant holidays than picket lines. More importantly, polling suggests the policies Rayner set out in the clip – employment rights from day one of a job, banning fire and rehire, binning bogus self-employment – are popular with the public.

Recent TUC polling found that two-thirds of people supported employees having the right to unfair dismissal from day one – including 61% of 2019 Tory voters. Similarly, two-thirds were in favour of a ban on fire and rehire.

Two things probably underlie the groundswell of opinion that tougher rules are needed in the labour market. One is the plain fact that too many people have found themselves working hard and still un­able to make ends meet. Real wage growth has been all but stagnant for the best part of 15 years, with average earnings a pathetic £16 a week higher than in 2010 – despite significant increases in the minimum wage (rebranded as the “national living wage”) under successive Conservative governments.

Against that backdrop, it is hardly surprising some feel the balance has tipped too far from workers to employers – a sentiment that perhaps also partly explains the ­support for public sector strikes last year.

It is more than that, however: there is a sense not just of a lack of bargaining power, but of unfairness, injustice even, in the way the labour market works for those trapped at the bottom.

From “self-employed” gig economy workers summarily laid off via an app to social care staff exploited by rogue employers and shift workers unable to plan childcare because of last-minute changes, there is an infuriating impotence about so many people’s interactions with the labour market. That is only likely to increase as new technologies are used to monitor and even manage workers as they go about their jobs.

In theory, Labour’s new deal for working people should help to turn the tide, particularly when combined with the tougher approach to enforcement Rayner has promised.

Social care is set to be the testing ground for a new approach of “fair pay agreements” under which employers and unions will have to hammer out terms and conditions that ministers will then apply across the sector.

Unions will be given the right to enter workplaces and make the case for membership – something the GMB has only just won at Amazon’s Coventry warehouse under strict conditions as part of a statutory ballot. And a new Labour government would consult about establishing a single employment status, abolishing the halfway house of “worker”, which comes with more obligations than rights.

As with so many areas of Labour’s agenda, however, the details will be critical – as will timing. Fair pay agreements were introduced in New Zealand in 2022, but implementation took so long that not a single one had come into force before the government changed and the plan was scrapped.

When, as seems likely, Rayner arrives at her desk as deputy prime minister on Friday, she will face intense pressure to water down the plans from business groups – and from some in her own party.

The Tory attack video ­echoed a line that originated with the CBI’s president, Rupert Soames, that Labour is poised to create a “European model” for the labour market. It is worth stressing how far away the UK is from that at present: Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development data suggests that 26% of workers here are covered by collective bargaining, for example, compared with 100% in Italy, 98% in France and 54% in Germany.

Regulation of the labour market has the potential to change millions of people’s lives for the better

But Soames’s concerns will find an echo among some in Labour. Furious unions confronted the party earlier this year over what they saw as an effort to undermine the new deal for workers – with union insiders claiming the shadow chancellor, Rachel Reeves, was keen to burnish her business credentials by being seen to push back against the plans. A fragile peace broke out after a face-to-face meeting between union general secretaries and shadow cabinet members, including Keir Starmer, but much about the fine details will only become clear the other side of the election.

The necessity to regain business backing has been a key part of Labour’s plan to win Thursday’s vote. If it succeeds, as polls suggest, the question facing the party on Friday will be a very different one: how to wield that power?

Regulation of the labour market is knotty, unglamorous and the subject of intense lobbying, but it has the potential to change millions of people’s lives for the better. Rayner should embrace the beret, face down the doubters and be bold.","Tory messaging has become ever more bizarre as this gaffe-strewn campaign lurches towards a close, but Thursday’s example, warning that Labour may make the UK’s labour market un peu French, hit new heights of weirdness.
Two things probably underlie the groundswell of opinion that tougher rules are needed in the labour market.

The upward revision to Q1 GDP growth from 0.6% quarter-on-quarter to 0.7% q/q this morning (see opening post) suggests whoever is Prime Minister this time next week may benefit from the economic recovery being a bit stronger than expected.

So says Paul Dales, chief UK economist at Capital Economics.

He told clients that the economy may grow faster than expected this year – a boost to the winner of next Thursday’s general election.

The larger rise in GDP in Q1 was mainly due to upward revisions to consumer spending (from +0.2% q/q to +0.4% q/q) and the contribution from net trade (from +0.4ppts to +0.6ppts) more than offsetting downward revisions to government spending (from +0.3% q/q to 0.0% q/q) and residential investment (from +4.1% q/q to +3.2% q/q). The revision suggests that real GDP growth in 2024 as a whole may be more likely to come in a bit above our existing forecast of 1.0%.

Dales adds:

It now looks as though real household disposable income will grow by more than our forecast of 2.0% this year and we are expecting a solid 3.5% gain next year too. This underpins our forecast that consumer spending will be the main driver of a rise in GDP of at least 1.0% this year and about 1.5% next year. Should the saving rate fall back from its unusually high level, the economic recovery could be even stronger. This is certainly good news for whoever will be the Prime Minister this time next week, although it could also contribute to the Bank of England cutting interest rates a bit slower than otherwise.","So says Paul Dales, chief UK economist at Capital Economics.

Gross domestic product (GDP) rose by 0.7% in the first three months of 2024, revised upwards by the Office for National Statistics from a first estimate of 0.6%.

The first-quarter figures were lifted by growth in the services sector, up by 0.8%, as well as the production sector, which expanded by 0.6%, although that was revised down from 0.8% in the initial estimate. Other areas of the economy fared less well, with bad weather hampering the construction sector, where output fell by 0.6%.

The data confirmed that the UK was the fastest-growing economy in the G7 during the first quarter after a short recession in the second half of last year.

Real household disposable income – how much each home is left with after tax, adjusted for inflation – is estimated to have increased by 0.7% in the first quarter of this year, matching the growth in the final quarter of 2023, according to the ONS.

The strength of the economy has been a big issue in the general election campaign after voters suffered a squeeze from higher inflation and increased mortgage rates over the past three years.

Rishi Sunak has insisted that the UK economy has turned a corner but the latest encouraging data comes less than a week before polling day.

The Resolution Foundation thinktank said living standards – as measured by real household disposable income per head – were up by 2.4% as a result of pay rising faster than prices.

Despite the improvement as cost of living pressures have eased, living standards over the 2019-24 parliament as a whole fell by 0.6%, leaving the average person £120 a year worse off than they were at the time of the last election.

Adam Corlett, the thinktank’s principal economist, said it was only the third time since the first world war that living standards had been lower at the end of a parliament than at the start.

The UK economy showed no growth in April, with an increase in the services sector offset by falls in production and construction after heavy rain hampered building work and deterred shoppers from spending on the high street.

However, more recent figures show consumer confidence is returning – bolstered by falling inflation and stronger retail sales. UK inflation fell to 2% in May returning to the official target rate for the first time in nearly three years. Figures released last week showed retail sales bounced back with 2.9% growth in May after a weather-affected drop of 1.8% the previous month.

Economists said the improving economy was likely to benefit the incoming prime minister, with the Bank of England widely expected to cut interest rates later this year.

“It now looks as though real household disposable income will grow by more than our forecast of 2.0% this year and we are expecting a solid 3.5% gain next year too,” said Paul Dales, the chief UK economist at the research company Capital Economics.

“This is certainly good news for whoever will be the prime minister this time next week, although it could also contribute to the Bank of England cutting interest rates a bit slower than otherwise.”

Dales said the household savings ratio – the proportion of disposable income saved rather than spent – stood at 11.1% in the first quarter, its highest level since the second quarter of 2021.

Households tend to save more when they feel uncertain about the future, and the savings ratio rose during the cost of living crisis. Dales said that should the savings ratio come down from its “unusually high level” growth could be stronger than the 1% and 1.5% he was expecting for 2024 and 2025 respectively.","The UK economy grew at a faster rate than previously thought in the first quarter of 2024, handing the next prime minister an improved economic backdrop.

Unless the polls are wildly inaccurate, the Conservative party is heading towards a catastrophic defeat in the coming election.

All across the rich world, voters are angry at their governments – they blame politicians for a burst of inflation that happened almost everywhere and is now subsiding almost everywhere, including in the UK. But the Conservatives deserve defeat more than most: they took power 14 years ago promising to deliver responsible policies and economic success. Instead they have presided over economic stagnation and a collapse in public services.

Why has Conservative governance gone so badly? It is natural to blame Brexit, which did indeed increase trade frictions and therefore surely had a negative effect on British real income. However, Brexit has not had the disastrous effects some predicted, and has somewhat perversely led to a rise rather than a fall in immigration, especially of the highly skilled.

In fact, the roots of Britain’s poor economic performance are older and deeper than Brexit. Though many bad decisions undoubtedly contributed, one central cause was the way David Cameron and George Osborne gratuitously embraced fiscal austerity when they came to power after the global financial crisis.

At the time, this looked like an obvious macroeconomic error; more than a decade later, it has become a social and political catastrophe.

Let us recall the circumstances when the Conservatives took power. The financial crisis had produced a severe global recession; by 2010 the world economy was growing again, but all major economies, Britain included, were still operating far below capacity and had high unemployment.

Textbook economics tells us that when unemployment is high and inflation is low, governments should try to stimulate demand with reduced interest rates and fiscal deficits. Interest cuts were not an option because rates were already close to zero, so the indicated policy was fiscal stimulus.

Yet the Cameron government chose to do the opposite, pulling back fiscal support from an economy that still needed it badly. Britain was not the only nation turning to fiscal austerity in the face of high unemployment – Greece engaged in savage austerity, while Portugal, Spain, Italy and Ireland made large cuts, and fiscal policy in the US also turned contractionary.

What made the British case unique was that it was almost entirely an unforced error. Southern European austerity was a response to pressure from the bond markets: Greece was in effect cut off from private markets, while other nations faced sharply increased borrowing costs, becoming dependent on official lenders who insisted on budget cuts as a condition for loans. Bond buyers never lost faith in the US, but after 2010 Barack Obama faced a deeply hostile Congress, which in effect blackmailed him into spending cuts by threatening to provoke a government default.

While Britain had low borrowing costs like the US, its government was not divided. The Cameron executive could have chosen to maintain spending. Why did it turn to austerity?

Part of the answer is that policymakers were genuinely spooked by the sudden emergence of the crisis in Greece. Until Greece hit the wall, debt crises were generally thought of as a problem that happened only in poorer nations. It is understandable that many observers, at least initially, wondered if the Greek crisis was the leading edge of a broader attack by bond vigilantes.

But UK debt was clearly far smaller relative to the economy than Greece’s – and it became obvious early on that contagion from the Greek debt crisis was restricted to eurozone nations. So there was no reason to continue believing that the UK risked “becoming Greece”, as many politicians recklessly claimed at the time.

In fact, it soon became clear that even the eurozone crisis was more a matter of market panic than one of fundamentally unsustainable levels of debt. As the economist Paul De Grauwe has said, nations with debts in another country’s currency can suffer something similar to a bank run: panicked investors seeking to pull out their funds can cause a government to run out of cash, forcing it into default. Nations that borrow in their own currency are not vulnerable to such a self-fulfilling crisis, because they can in effect print money in a crunch.

This analysis was validated in 2012 when Mario Draghi, the president of the European Central Bank (ECB), said three words: “Whatever it takes.” This was taken to mean that the ECB would, if necessary, supply cash to governments facing a market panic. And suddenly the euro “debt” crisis faded away, with investors demanding much lower interest rates on the debt of Italy, Spain and so on.

Since Britain has not adopted the euro and had debts in its own currency, it was not vulnerable to this kind of cash crisis.

The bottom line is that there was no pressing economic need to slash spending in the face of high unemployment. I would argue that the best way to explain Britain’s austerity is not economic but sociological.

Sociology? I used to talk about the push for austerity being led by Very Serious People (a term I borrowed from the blogger Duncan Black). This was not really a joke: if you spend any time consorting with members of the global policy elite, you realise that many of them are driven primarily by the desire to appear “serious”. In economic terms, this usually means pushing policies that will cause significant hardship – to other people, of course.

The obsession with perceived seriousness reflects peer pressure, but in some ways also reflects personal careerism. Officials in democratic nations cannot expect to remain in office for more than a few years. What do they do next? If they have lobbied for “serious” policies, they can have a bright future giving speeches at Davos about the importance of making “tough choices”. Or they might even end up employed by the financial industry to lobby their former colleagues – where a reputation for “seriousness” is a prerequisite, no matter how much damage those policies have caused. (Indeed, Osborne has done both.)

Sociology partly explains the Conservative embrace of austerity. But there was also political calculation. Denunciations of debt and deficits often go hand in hand with demands for smaller government, in particular a shrunken welfare state. In effect, politicians whose real goal is to move policy to the right exploit fear of deficits to push an agenda that would be deeply unpopular if stated openly. The Oxford economist Simon Wren-Lewis calls this the “deficit deceit” hypothesis. The deceit aspect is especially obvious in the US, where Republican leaders routinely denounce deficits while pushing for budget-busting tax cuts. But there is every reason to believe that the same kind of cynicism played an important role in UK austerity.

It turns out, however, that exploiting debt fears to engineer cuts in public spending tends not to work out quite the way that small-government advocates hope.

What serious conservatives – they do exist – want is a less generous social safety net, with fewer income transfers to households, while governments concentrate on those functions that only government can perform. I do not share that desire, but never mind. What is important is that voters do not share that desire: cutting direct financial aid is deeply unpopular.

What does this have to do with deficit deceit? Even when a government manages to build support for spending cuts by scaring the public about debt and deficits, it generally finds itself shying away from spending cuts that will directly affect families’ incomes. Instead, it tries to save money by shortchanging public investment and public services, a strategy that seems preferable because the consequences of these spending cuts may not be all that visible in the short run.

But the effects of inadequate public investment cumulate over time, so that a fiscal strategy advertised as an exercise in responsibility ends up being deeply irresponsible, leading to crumbling infrastructure and deteriorating public services. This is how Cameron and Osborne’s error has compounded over the past decade.

Consider the NHS. I am clearly not an expert on the system, and I am sure that the NHS’s problems have multiple causes. But it is obvious to an outsider that direct public provision of healthcare, while it has major advantages, creates a special form of political vulnerability.

Compare the NHS with single-payer systems – including Medicare, which serves older Americans – in which the government pays the bills but does not employ the doctors or operate the hospitals. An attempt to save money by underfunding Medicare would provoke an immediate public outcry – in fact, false rumours of such a move created an outcry in 2010. But a government can underfund the NHS for years before the consequences become obvious to voters, and by that time the crisis can be very hard to fix.

To sum up: a decade ago, the main critique of austerity was macroeconomic – it was holding back recovery from the severe recession that followed the global financial crisis. And it did. But that was not the end of the story. Austerity also gradually undermined public services, including healthcare.

What will a Labour government do to reverse this damage? There are two reasons to worry it will fall short.

First, the era of Conservative austerity coincided with an era of low interest rates and substantial excess capacity, exactly the conditions under which Britain should have been investing in its future. The current environment is much less favourable.

Second, Labour’s stated plans lack any ambition to reverse austerity. In the US, the Biden administration came in with bold plans and managed to accomplish a significant fraction of them despite having only a razor-thin congressional majority. I am not hearing anything comparable from Labour, even though Keir Starmer seems on course to have political capital beyond the wildest dreams of US progressives.

I hope to be proved wrong. But right now it looks as though the shadow of austerity policies adopted in error 14 years ago will continue to darken Britain’s prospects for many years to come.","Though many bad decisions undoubtedly contributed, one central cause was the way David Cameron and George Osborne gratuitously embraced fiscal austerity when they came to power after the global financial crisis.

The Guardian,https://www.theguardian.com/politics/article/2024/jun/27/labour-europe-eu-brexit-jonathan-reynolds,2024-06-27,16:47:34 UTC,Labour to seek ‘stable position’ with Europe rather than reopen Brexit debate,"Labour would rather have stability in the UK’s relationship with Europe than try to seek accelerated economic growth by rejoining the EU’s single market or customs union, the shadow business secretary has said.

Addressing the British Chambers of Commerce (BCC) conference on Thursday, Jonathan Reynolds acknowledged that Brexit had been “very difficult for businesses” because it had erected trade barriers, but said reopening the debate would be worse.

With less than a week to go until polls open in the general election, Reynolds was trying to woo business leaders at the London event with a pitch that emphasised policy stability and encouraged businesses to invest.

Some business leaders and economists have said Labour’s hopes to grow the economy – and thereby pay for improved public services – could flounder without improved access to EU trade. But Reynolds argued that returning to the tumultuous debate over Brexit would be economically harmful because businesses would hold back investments further.

“You could not relive the argument and provide people with the assurance they need that we are moving to a period where British politics is going to be in a stable position rather than frankly causing you more difficulties,” he said.

“The practical, trade-based agreements that we put forward, rather than the constitutional arguments around customs unions or single markets, are a genuinely better way to do that.”

Kemi Badenoch, Reynolds’s Conservative counterpart, appeared later at the same event. She portrayed a Labour government as a threat to the sector and said her party believed in the “power of business to do good”.

However, the business secretary focused much of her appearance on “my favourite topic, of course, the divisive topic of identity politics”.

Badenoch compared Labour plans to monitor ethnic pay disparities to apartheid South Africa, saying she thought that the policy – an idea previously proposed by the Tory prime minister Theresa May – was “morally repellent” and claimed Labour wanted ethnicity to influence pay.

Labour’s manifesto does not say ethnicity should influence pay. The party has pledged to “enshrine in law the full right to equal pay for Black, Asian and other ethnic minority people” as well as make larger companies report the gap between pay for disabled and ethnic minority employees and the broader workforce. The Conservative party introduced similar gender pay gap reporting in 2017.

Shevaun Haviland, the BCC’s director general, told the conference that the political parties must stop “walking on eggshells” and try to improve the UK’s relationship with Europe, notably on aligning food and drink regulations, VAT and mutual recognition of professional qualifications. However, she added that Reynolds was right that “businesses don’t want a renegotiation”.

Amanda Blanc, the chief executive of the FTSE 100 insurer Aviva, told the conference that “an air of weariness and cynicism hangs over our economy” and that some of the “doom and gloom” was justified. However, she said she was optimistic that stable public policy after the election would allow businesses to invest in growing the economy.

Labour’s emollient message to business contrasts with 2019, when it lost the last election under the leadership of Jeremy Corbyn. Reynolds said the party’s relationship with business was “one of the most visible ways that Labour has changed since 2019”.

He was challenged at the conference by the owners of one business who said they were concerned about Labour’s pledge to give workers stronger rights, such as statutory sick pay and parental leave, from their first day of employment rather than after two years.

Fintan and Alison Galvin, a couple who serve as the chief executive and chief people officer of the Surrey-based software company Inv Group, said they were concerned that the changes would make it riskier for them to hire and train new workers.

“It seems very anti-business,” Alison Galvin said. “All of a sudden to have this potential curveball … You’ve got your probation period, but then after that what does that all look like?”

Fintan Galvin said: “To grow a business you’ve got to take risks. Anything that enhances a risk profile of employing a person is bad.”

Reynolds said he did not believe that Labour’s changes would affect the company’s recruitment practices, and he invited them to meet him to discuss their concerns.

During the election campaign Labour has also avoided making surprise policy announcements, mostly sticking with longstanding policy. Reynolds defended the party against accusations of running a boring campaign.

“I’m told by some commentators they don’t think Labour’s campaign is exciting enough,” he said. “Look, my friends, we’re not pitching you a new Netflix series, you know, we’re not putting on politics as entertainment.”","But Reynolds argued that returning to the tumultuous debate over Brexit would be economically harmful because businesses would hold back investments further.

Newsflash: The Bank of England has warned that financial markets remain at risk of a sharp correction.

In its latest financial stability report, the BoE says that high inflation, or geopolitical risks, could trigger a selloff.

The Bank says risks to the UK financial system are “broadly unchanged” since the first quarter of the year.

But some asset prices have continued to rise, it points out, while the risk of a sharp correction persists.

European markets are up around 8% so far this year, while the US Nasdaq Composite index has surged by 18%.

The report, which is designed to track the stability of the financial system, says:

The prices of many assets such as shares and bonds remain high relative to historical norms, and some have continued to rise. This suggests that investors in financial markets are continuing to expect the economy to recover and inflation to fall. They are placing less weight on risks, such as geopolitical developments or continued high inflation, that might cause weaker growth or interest rates to stay higher than expected. These risks make it more likely that there could be a sharp correction in asset prices that could ultimately make it more costly and difficult for UK households and businesses to borrow.

Overall, UK households and businesses have remained resilient to the impact of higher interest rates.","['risks', 'financial', 'system', 'households', 'report', 'high', 'businesses', 'happened', 'correction', 'bank', 'uk', 'gdp', 'sharp', 'markets', 'risk', 'revised']",https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/1d159073dad20491092b34324a6d2eb5b19e1cfe/760_1344_5017_3011/master/5017.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctbGl2ZS5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=54032d54dd47427ca43d02193595c867,False
The Guardian,https://www.theguardian.com/business/article/2024/jun/27/global-elections-uk-economy-bank-of-england,2024-06-27,11:33:58 UTC,"Global wave of elections could hit UK financial system, warns Bank of England","Uncertainty caused by a global wave of elections, starting this weekend in France, risks destabilising the UK’s financial system, the Bank of England has warned.

Officials are concerned about the kind of policies that newly elected governments may enforce in large economies, including the US, where Donald Trump is vying for another term as president in the run-up to the election in November.

The French president Emmanuel Macron’s shock announcement of a parliamentary election, with a first round of voting on 30 June and Marine Le Pen’s far-right National Rally party forecast to make significant gains, had shown how political uncertainty could impact economic growth forecasts and cause volatility in financial markets, affecting government debt prices, the Bank’s financial policy committee (FPC) said.

But it is the sheer number of elections taking place this year that was cause for concern, with more than 80 countries – more than half the world’s population –heading to the polls this year. That includes the UK, where citizens will vote in a general election on 4 July.

“Policy uncertainty associated with upcoming elections globally has increased,” the Bank’s financial stability report said. Questions over a country’s political direction could amplify geopolitical risks, increase government borrowing costs, and lead to further global fragmentation, in a way that was “relevant to UK financial stability”, it said.

The FPC said it was still monitoring the impact high interest rates were having on households and businesses in the UK, with the Bank’s monetary policy committee having held rates at 5.25% this month for the seventh consecutive time.

That includes the 400,000 households whose monthly mortgage payments are expected to soar by 50% as they roll off fixed rates between now and the end of 2026.

In total, about 3 million – or 35% – of mortgageholders are still on fixed rates of below 3% and are due to see their payments jump over the next two years.

However, if headline interest rates drop from August onwards, as markets predict, another 2 million mortgageholders – including those on variable rates or coming off mortgages set at a higher level – could benefit, offsetting refinancing pressure for some households.

There are also concerns about the financial system’s exposures to the $8tn private-equity industry, which boomed during a period of low interests rates and has grown to play a significant role in financing UK businesses.

“Although the sector has been resilient so far, it is facing challenges in the higher rate environment,” the FPC said, noting this was becoming apparent as firms were forced to refinance their debt at much higher prices.

The FPC said it had also found “gaps” in the way UK banks were managing their exposure to the private-equity industry. The Bank of England and Financial Conduct Authority said they were working together to address a lack of transparency in overall borrowing levels, as well as the valuation of private-equity firms and their investments.

Policymakers said they would continue to test the resilience of the UK’s banking sector, revealing they would be testing the industry against the possibility of two separate and “severe” economic shocks.

The first – a “supply-shock scenario” echoing the ripple effects of Russia’s invasion of Ukraine – would cause inflation and interest rates to soar to 12% and 9%, respectively, as geopolitical tensions disrupt supply chains and cause the price of global commodities to soar.

The second “demand-shock scenario” – which has similarities to the impact of Covid-era lockdowns – assumes demand for global goods and services in decline, sending inflation and interest rates below 0.5% for a prolonged period of time.

In both cases, unemployment is projected to peak at 8.5% and the property industry would take a big hit, with commercial real estate prices declining by nearly 50%.

This year’s so-called desk-based stress tests are the second to be conducted without input from individual banks since they were launched a decade ago in response to the 2008 financial crisis.

The turbulent rally comes days after the investor, known for triggering the meme-stock rally of 2021, posted an uncaptioned picture of a puppy on the social media platform X that briefly sent Chewy shares to a near one-year high on Thursday.

Chewy reversed all its gains and entered the red shortly after the New York Stock Exchange opened on Monday. It finished the day down 6.6%.

The filing with the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), which lists Gill as the reporting person, included a section “Check the appropriate box to designate whether you are a cat” under which the descriptor “I am not a cat” was checked.

The SEC, Chewy and Gill did not immediately respond to requests for comment.

The filing showed that Gill owns 9m shares of Chewy, equating to a stake worth about $245m at the stock’s Friday closing price of $27.24. The stake would make Gill Chewy’s third-largest shareholder, according to LSEG data.

Meme stocks – boosted by memes on social media – first e​merged as a force three years ago, when amateur traders mobilized on platforms including Reddit to boost shares in GameStop.

Their bids triggered an extraordinary, but fleeting, increase in GameStop’s stock market value. It also left hedge funds that had bet against the company nursing heavy losses.

Gill, who led an army of retail investors backing GameStop, is known for his posts on Reddit – where he is known as “DeepFuckingValue” – and YouTube. While silent on the platforms for years after 2021’s frenzy, he has re-emerged in recent months.

Shares of Chewy, which sells pet food as well as medicine online, have risen 15% so far in 2024 but declined in the three preceding years as spending on pets slowed after a post-pandemic boom.

Its sales have been stable in the past few quarters despite weaker consumer spending on discretionary items. “Pet humanization” is a key part of Chewy’s strategy, in which owners splurge on pets as they are considered a part of the family.

Some analysts said last week that Gill’s interest in Chewy could also be influenced by the fact that the pet retailer was founded by GameStop CEO Ryan Cohen.","Shares of Chewy rose 15% premarket on Monday, before reversing sharply, after a filing showed Keith Gill, the stock influencer known as “Roaring Kitty”, had picked up a 6.6% stake in the pet products e-retailer.

Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of business, the financial markets and the world economy.

Sales at Sainsbury’s have slowed despite a 25% jump in people buying TVs during Euro 2024, partly because of a big drop in sales at its Argos chain.

Food inflation has eased, and the supermarket group battled a “tough trading backdrop” on clothing and general merchandise amid poor weather and the cost of living crisis.

Like-for-like sales (at stores open at least a year), excluding fuel, slowed to 2.7% in the 16 weeks to 22 June, from 4.8% in the previous quarter.

Food sales growth eased to 4.8% from 7.3% as inflation across the market eased.

Argos sales plunged by 6.2% in the latest quarter, because people bought less garden furniture, paddling pools and other seasonal products than last year due to cold and wet weather. Sales electronics such as video games were also weak.

Sainsbury’s said:

Consumers continue to shop general merchandise more cautiously but respond to value. More positive signs are coming through now in general merchandise with the better weather and the Summer of Sport ramping up.

As the warm weather hit last week, people immediately stocked up on cooling and garden products. Sainsbury’s said it sold more fans in one week than it had in the year to date. Thanks to the euros, TV sales have surged, as fans upgraded to better sets ahead of the big matches.

The supermarket chain stuck to its forecast of a retail underlying operating profit of between £1.01bn and £1.06bn this year, up between 5% and 10% from last year.

Later this morning, we’ll be getting ‘flash’ inflation figures for June from the eurozone.

Inflation in the 20-nation eurozone is expected to have fallen slightly, to 2.5% from 2.6% in May.

Eurostat, the European Commission’s office, will release the data at 10am BST. The core rate, which excludes volatile items like food and energy, is forecast to have eased to 2.8% from 2.9%.

The euro rose against the dollar, while the risk premium investors demand for holding French government bonds fell as the markets took the view that the result could have been worse.

But despite a 1.5% jump in France’s benchmark stock market measure – the Cac 40 – on Monday, shares have fallen 5% in the past month amid fears that Marine Le Pen’s RN could still emerge from next Sunday’s second round of voting with an overall majority.

RN secured 33% of the vote, while the leftwing New Popular Front secured 28% and Emmanuel Macron’s centrist bloc won the support of 20% of those who voted.

Alex Everett, an investment manager at the fund management company abrdn, said: “We are not out of the woods yet. The National Rally exceeded expectations and may yet pick up the second-round votes for a relative or even absolute majority.

“Intense horse trading until Tuesday evening will likely see deals cut between the left and centre parties to try to derail this.”

On Friday, the gap between the interest rate (yield) on French and German bonds had widened to its highest since the eurozone debt crisis in 2012, but the spread narrowed slightly from 0.85 percentage points to 0.75 points after the results came in. The gap was less than 0.5 points before the snap election was called.

Krishna Guha, an analyst at the US investment bank Evercore, said: “The vote is far from definitive but leans in favour of the less bad scenario of a hung parliament, political paralysis in Paris and chronic dysfunction at the EU level rather than the worse scenarios of an outright win for the far right or far left that might directly lead to a new European sovereign crisis.”

Agustín Carstens, the general manager of the Bank for International Settlements (BIS), said the world economy was on course for a “smooth landing” from the inflation crisis, but he warned that policymakers, especially politicians, needed to be careful.

Global government debt is already at record levels and elections ranging from the US presidential vote in November, to recent polls in Mexico and South Africa, and votes in France and Britain in the coming week, all carry risks.

Emmanuel Macron’s decision to call a snap election in France has sent the country’s bank stocks crashing and alarmed the bond markets, exacerbating fiscal sustainability concerns in the eurozone’s second-largest economy.

Polls released before the first round of voting on Sunday suggested the far right could win the largest share of the vote, amid record turnout.

Carstens said the BIS was not calling out any “one or two” governments but that the message was clear.

“They [governments] must cut short the rise in public debt and accept that interest rates may not return to the pre-pandemic ultra-low levels,” he said. “We need a solid foundation to build upon.”

With interest rates not about to go back to ultra-low levels, and cost pressures from ageing populations, climate breakdown and rebuilding defence capabilities, economic stimulus plans and a general rise in protectionism could unsettle sensitive markets, BIS warned as it published its annual report.

“They can surprise you with not much notice,” Carstens told reporters, pointing to the turbulence in Britain’s markets after then prime minister Liz Truss’s budget plans, which put some pension funds at risk of collapse. “You really want to avoid that.”

France’s main parties have all promised new spending. Macron’s government had promised to cut the budget deficit from 5.5% of gross domestic product last year to a European Union ceiling of 3% by 2027 – an objective that may be unattainable after the vote, which concludes with a second round on 7 July.

If it forms a government, Marine Le Pen’s National Rally (RN) wants to cut value-added tax (VAT) on energy, which it says would cost €7bn (£5.9bn) for the rest of this year and €12bn in a full year. The RN would also scrap a 2023 increase in the retirement age to 64 from 62, and says its spending plans would be paid for by cutting contributions to the EU budget.

The left-wing New Popular Front alliance, now polling second, says its first moves would include a 10% civil servant pay hike, providing free school lunches, supplies and transport while raising housing subsidies by 10%.

The turmoil has sent the cost to the French government of servicing its debt on the international markets rocketing, with the risk premium, or spread, demanded by holders of French debt over Germany’s rising to its highest level since 2012.

France’s blue-chip CAC 40 index is down 6% since Macron dissolved parliament, with French banks having been among the biggest losers. The big three – Société Générale, BNP Paribas and Crédit Agricole – are down 10%-14% since Macron’s announcement.

French banks have a large amount of debt and are expected to suffer if credit costs increase sharply.

The positive for Carstens was that central banks have successfully reined in inflation, which had hit decades-long highs after the Covid-19 pandemic, and then Russia’s 2022 invasion of Ukraine, which riled commodity markets.

“Compared to last year, I have to say we are in a much better place,” the former Mexican central bank governor said.

Although Carstens said central banks deserved praise for navigating a difficult path that could have resulted in a wave of recessions, he added that they needed to persevere, likening the inflation fight to a course of antibiotics to tackle an illness.

He described an “extreme” scenario where inflation raced up again and central banks needed to raise rates further. But that is not what the BIS expects.","Rising government debt levels could disturb global financial markets, the head of the body that advises central banks said on Sunday before France’s high-stakes parliamentary elections.

The upward revision to Q1 GDP growth from 0.6% quarter-on-quarter to 0.7% q/q this morning (see opening post) suggests whoever is Prime Minister this time next week may benefit from the economic recovery being a bit stronger than expected.

So says Paul Dales, chief UK economist at Capital Economics.

He told clients that the economy may grow faster than expected this year – a boost to the winner of next Thursday’s general election.

The larger rise in GDP in Q1 was mainly due to upward revisions to consumer spending (from +0.2% q/q to +0.4% q/q) and the contribution from net trade (from +0.4ppts to +0.6ppts) more than offsetting downward revisions to government spending (from +0.3% q/q to 0.0% q/q) and residential investment (from +4.1% q/q to +3.2% q/q). The revision suggests that real GDP growth in 2024 as a whole may be more likely to come in a bit above our existing forecast of 1.0%.

Dales adds:

It now looks as though real household disposable income will grow by more than our forecast of 2.0% this year and we are expecting a solid 3.5% gain next year too. This underpins our forecast that consumer spending will be the main driver of a rise in GDP of at least 1.0% this year and about 1.5% next year. Should the saving rate fall back from its unusually high level, the economic recovery could be even stronger. This is certainly good news for whoever will be the Prime Minister this time next week, although it could also contribute to the Bank of England cutting interest rates a bit slower than otherwise.","So says Paul Dales, chief UK economist at Capital Economics.

Newsflash: The Bank of England has warned that financial markets remain at risk of a sharp correction.

In its latest financial stability report, the BoE says that high inflation, or geopolitical risks, could trigger a selloff.

The Bank says risks to the UK financial system are “broadly unchanged” since the first quarter of the year.

But some asset prices have continued to rise, it points out, while the risk of a sharp correction persists.

European markets are up around 8% so far this year, while the US Nasdaq Composite index has surged by 18%.

The report, which is designed to track the stability of the financial system, says:

The prices of many assets such as shares and bonds remain high relative to historical norms, and some have continued to rise. This suggests that investors in financial markets are continuing to expect the economy to recover and inflation to fall. They are placing less weight on risks, such as geopolitical developments or continued high inflation, that might cause weaker growth or interest rates to stay higher than expected. These risks make it more likely that there could be a sharp correction in asset prices that could ultimately make it more costly and difficult for UK households and businesses to borrow.

Our Financial Stability Report looks at the risks in our financial system and what we are doing to ensure households and businesses can rely on it. https://t.co/OeyRKKWGZw #FinancialStabilityReport pic.twitter.com/BJGPfvopyz — Bank of England (@bankofengland) June 27, 2024

The report also warns that

The Guardian,https://www.theguardian.com/business/article/2024/jun/26/human-rights-group-fca-shein-lse-flotation-uyghurs,2024-06-26,16:11:48 UTC,Human rights group urges UK financial regulator to block Shein’s LSE flotation,"A human rights group has urged Britain’s financial regulator to block the Chinese fast-fashion retailer Shein’s planned blockbuster flotation on the London Stock Exchange.

Stop Uyghur Genocide, a UK-based human rights charity that alleges minority Uyghur people are being used as forced labour at some of Shein’s cotton suppliers in China’s north-western Xinjiang region, has begun a legal campaign against the planned stock market listing.

Represented by the law firm Leigh Day, the campaign group has written to the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) to argue that “any attempt by Shein to list on the LSE should be refused”.

The China-founded company, which was valued at $66bn (£52bn) in a fundraising round last year, began to explore a listing on the LSE early this year, and is expected to file a prospectus with the UK regulator soon. Shein abandoned its original plan to list in New York after opposition from US politicians.

On Tuesday, Amnesty International UK said Shein’s potential London listing would be a “badge of shame” for the London market because of the fast-fashion firm’s “questionable” labour and human rights standards.

The fast-fashion retailer said on Wednesday: “Shein has a zero-tolerance policy for forced labour and we are committed to respecting human rights. We take visibility across our entire supply chain seriously and we require our contract manufacturers to only source cotton from approved regions.”

Stop Uyghur Genocide said it had reminded the FCA that its US counterpart, the Securities and Exchange Commission, has already refused to recommend the listing of Shein for trading on the US stock exchange because of concerns around labour practices in the company’s supply chains.

The group said the London listing should not be allowed to go ahead because the UK has signed up to International Labour Organization conventions, which set out minimum standards for engaging workers. Any concerns about companies engaging workers in their supply chains that may breach those minimum standards are inconsistent with the UK’s convention obligations, it said.

“The FCA has a statutory duty of integrity and to protect its investors,” the group added.

The Leigh Day solicitor Ricardo Gama, who represents Stop Uyghur Genocide, said: “Stop Uyghur Genocide expects UK financial institutions to uphold the high ethical standards that they pay lip service to, and to make clear that London isn’t the place to come for a ‘no questions asked’ approach to capital. At the very minimum regulators must make sure that laws in place to root out modern slavery are complied with.”

Stop Uyghur Genocide said it was concerned about the London Stock Exchange’s ability to detect and respond to any alleged forced labour in Shein’s supply chains.

Stop Uyghur Genocide is preparing a detailed submission to the regulator to support its letter.

In the meantime, the campaign group’s lawyers have asked the FCA to obtain more information from Shein about the “accuracy of its published modern slavery statement”.



Under the Modern Slavery Act, large businesses have to publish a statement every year that sets out the measures they have taken to ensure slavery and trafficking do not occur in their own operations and their supply chains.

Leigh Day lawyers have urged the regulator to “refuse Shein’s listing application unless the FCA is satisfied that its products are not tainted by forced labour”.

Rahima Mahmut, executive director of Stop Uyghur Genocide, said she was “deeply concerned” about Shein’s potential London listing and said the organisation had been highlighting concerns from national security and human rights experts that Shein “could be associated with egregious human rights abuses, including modern slavery, and pose ethical and security risks to businesses and citizens”.

“Our investment community must not support companies like Shein who are reportedly linked to the Chinese state and which we believe may enable the ongoing genocidal policies against Uyghurs.”

The FCA declined to comment on Shein’s potential listing. It noted that it has no investigation or enforcement powers relating to alleged breaches of legislation not within its remit, such as the Modern Slavery Act or tax legislation.

Before a company’s shares can be admitted to the LSE, the firm must apply to the FCA for admission to listing and to approve its prospectus. The watchdog said it was the company’s responsibility to ensure the information in its prospectus is accurate, and not the FCA’s role to independently verify the accurate of information.

Michael Polak, barrister and chair of Lawyers for Uyghur Rights, said: “A firm alleged to have involvement in goods directly produced by slave labour in the Uyghur region creates a risk that those vital principles will be violated. We will ask the FCA to consider the expert evidence that we will provide to them before deciding on a public listing in the UK.”","A human rights group has urged Britain’s financial regulator to block the Chinese fast-fashion retailer Shein’s planned blockbuster flotation on the London Stock Exchange.

Today’s report says: The eurozone has exited the recent manufacturing recession, putting it cyclically ahead of the U.S. Meanwhile, the labor market continues to slow although the unemployment rate remains near all-time lows. Southern Europe (Spain and Italy) continues to outperform Northern Europe (Germany) not only due to a prevalence of services, but also a rise in productivity in the case of Spain. Recent slower growth at the eurozone level reflects in part a faster passthrough of monetary policy, which has led to weaker inflation pressures. Share

However, the UK growth forecast in 2025 has been trimmed to 1.2%, from 1.4%. Spain’s growth forecast has also been revised up, to 2.2% in 2024 from 1.8%. This is to reflect “robust household balance sheets and rapid disinflation”, Gruenwald explains. Share

5d ago 14.35 CEST S&P Global: soft-landing narrative remains valid The global economy remain on track for a soft landing, as central banks start to lower interest rates followin recent falls in inflation. So says credit rating agency S&P Global, in its latest global economic update. S&P Global is still optimistic that policymakers will pull off a ‘soft landing’ – bringing down inflation without triggering a recession. It explains: GDP growth has moderated in most economies (the U.S. remains an outlier) and recessions have been avoided. Demand pressures have come down, bringing inflation back toward target. Services demand and employment remain robust, moderating the speed of decline, and bolstering the probability of a soft landing. S&P Global argues that central banks have reached “the beginning of the end-game”, as some – such as the Bank of Canada, the Swiss National Bank and the European Central Bank – have recently started cutting interest rates in response to falling inflation. Although inflation has been stickier than hoped, S&P Global argues this is “just the flipside” of resilient spending and strong jobs markets, and compatible with a soft landing. They say: A recession with a sharp drop in employment and labor demand would likely produce a faster decline in inflation, but is that what we really want? Share

5d ago 14.32 CEST Dominic Chappell must repay £50m over BHS collapse Back in the UK retail sector, the former head of BHS is digesting a court ruling that he must pay at least £50m to cover losses racked up before its collapse. Yeterday, a judge found that Dominic Chappell had sought to “plunder” the UK department store chain, which collapsed in 2016. Mr Justice Leech said Chappell had agreed to purchase BHS without “any prospect” of obtaining working capital to meet its day-to-day financial needs. He then took the “opportunity to plunder the BHS Group as and when he could”, the judge explained. The Financial Times has more details: At a hearing on Tuesday, the judge said Chappell “should make the payments” set out in a draft order. A copy of the order, seen by the Financial Times, shows the sums include £21.5m for a wrongful trading claim, £17.5m for breach of fiduciary duty, plus costs and interest, totalling at least £50m. Back in 2020, Chappell was been sentenced to six years in jail for evading tax on the £2.2m income he received from his doomed takeover of BHS.

The CBI’s latest healthcheck on UK retailers, just released, found that retail sales volumes fell in the year to June, following a modest recovery in May. The CBI’s retail sales volume gauge fell to -24% this month, from +8% in May, showing that a majority of retailers reported a drop in volumes compared to the previous year.

Sales volumes are expected to remain below seasonal norms in July, albeit to a lesser extent (-29%).

Orders placed upon suppliers fell moderately in the year to June at a broadly similar pace to last month (-14% from -11% in May). Retailers expect the cutback in orders to continue next month (-16%). Alpesh Paleja, CBI interim deputy chief economist, says: “Last month’s nascent recovery in sales proved to be short-lived, with retailers reporting a faster-than-anticipated decline this month. Unseasonably cold weather in June may have played a role, but it’s notable that internet retail sales fell sharply in our survey, too. Consumer fundamentals are improving, with inflation now at the Bank of England’s 2% target and real incomes rising. But it’s clear that households are still struggling with the legacies of the cost-of-living crisis, with the level of prices still historically high in some areas. With consumer demand still on shaky ground, an incoming government can help business by ensuring that the UK is the most attractive place to start, grow and run a business. This will require bold action such as delivering a holistic cross-economy solution to the UK’s overly complex business rates system, which is a particular burden for retailers. This would help to alleviate the burden of higher costs.” Share

5d ago 11.34 CEST LGIM will also divest from TJX Legal & General Investment Management has also decided to divest its stake in US retail chain TJX, the parent company of UK chain TK Maxx. LGIM says TJX, like Glencore, failed to sufficiently address concerns raised in recent years about its environmental impact. LGIM says it concerned over TJX’s lack of a zero-deforestation policy and insufficient disclosure of “material Scope 3 emissions” that fail to account for its material value chains’ emissions. Today’s decisions will raise the number of divestments through LGIM’s Climate Impact Pledge to 16. LGIM says this “stewardship” of its investments is a critical lever in the global push to reach net zero. Stephen Beer, senior manager sustainability and responsible investment at Legal & General Investment Management, adds: We find that as time progresses, our conversations with companies can become harder-edged; not necessarily more difficult, but more focused. We use tools such as voting and divestment to encourage companies to meet our expectations on net-zero, while also sending a clear signal to the wider market. While divestment is one of the many stewardship tools we use as a mechanism for driving change, we see it as a last resort and by no means the last stage of engagement. Our engagement will continue, and where companies make sufficient progress, they will be reinstated. Ultimately, whilst we are focused on a net-zero objective, there is no one size fits all approach; our engagement approach is nuanced, it is about listening to companies and understanding the challenges they face, as well as the potential opportunities ahead, in accelerating the pace of the transition at a global scale.” Share","Share5d ago 14.56 CEST S&P Global have raised their forecast for the UK economy this year.

The UK authorities and the London Stock Exchange should not facilitate SHEIN’s listing until transparent and binding safeguards regarding internationally accepted human rights standards covering its entire supply chain are agreed and applied, and any abuses identified fully remedied. “Rewarding SHEIN’s current methods via a flotation would be a badge of shame for the London Stock Exchange, the bankers helping bring it to market, and any investors set to profit from it. It would be an appalling example of a process which delivers for the rich by squeezing the poor. It validates the view that it is acceptable to regard workers and their rights, company products and the environment as expendable – which cheapens us all. “It is essential the new UK government does not allow a race to the bottom in terms of corporate and human rights standards. It should require companies to prevent serious environmental harms and human rights abuses occurring throughout their entire operations and supply chains. It should enable workers whose rights are abused by company activities anywhere in the world recourse to justice through UK courts.” Shein has been accused of using forced labour to make its affordable clothing, such as t-shirts and sweaters. ‘Worst of the worst’: why is fast fashion retailer Shein launching a reality show?

6d ago 14.25 CEST Fed Governor Bowman open to raising rates if inflation doesn’t improve A US central bank policymaker has indicated she would be open to raising interest rates if inflation not fall as hoped. In a speech in London today, Federal Reserve governor Michelle Bowman also said the time is not right yet to start lowering borrowing costs. Bowman explained: Should the incoming data indicate that inflation is moving sustainably toward our 2% goal, it will eventually become appropriate to gradually lower the federal funds rate to prevent monetary policy from becoming overly restrictive. However, we are still not yet at the point where it is appropriate to lower the policy rate. In my view, we should consider a range of possible scenarios that could unfold when considering how the FOMC’s monetary policy decisions may evolve. I remain willing to raise the target range for the federal funds rate at a future meeting should progress on inflation stall or even reverse. Latest comments from Fed's Bowman, though at the more hawkish end of the spectrum, suggest chances of the US Fed cutting rates this year (notwithstanding the Nov Presidential Elections) rapidly receding.

It is the story of how Europe and Russia remain locked in a tense relationship of economic dependence, even as they supposedly cut their ties. It is the story of the uncomfortable truth behind why the cost of living crisis came to an end.

But before all of that, it is the story of a ship - a very unusual ship indeed.

If you ever spot the Yakov Gakkel as it sails through the English Channel or the Irish Sea (I first set eyes on it in the Channel but at the time of writing it was sailing northwards, about 20 miles off the coast of Anglesey) you might not find it all that remarkable.

At first glance it looks like many of the other large, nondescript tankers and cargo vessels passing these shores. Its profile is dominated by an enormous blue prow which reaches high out of the water and ends, 50 metres further back, at its unexpectedly angular stern.

Yet the ship's slightly odd shape - all hull and barely any deck - is the first clue about what makes the Yakov Gakkel so special. Because this is one of the world's most advanced liquefied natural gas (LNG) tankers, with an unusual trick up its sleeve.

Image: The Yakov Gakkel tanker

LNG tankers are extraordinary ships, with insides so cleverly engineered they are capable of holding vast amounts of natural gas at temperatures of approximately −163C.

For all that the world is embracing renewable energy, natural gas remains one of the most important energy sources, essential for much of Europe's heating and power, not to mention its industries. For the time being, there is no cheap way of making many industrial products, from glass and paper to critical chemicals and fertilisers, without gas.

Once upon a time, moving natural gas from one part of the world to another necessitated sending it down long, expensive, vulnerable pipelines, meaning only countries with a physical connection to gas producers could receive this vital fuel. But LNG tankers like the Yakov Gakkel are part of the answer to this problem, since they allow gas producers to send it by sea to anywhere with a terminal capable of turning their supercooled methane back into the gas we use to heat our homes and power our grids.

Image: Politicians in Europe promised to end the continent's reliance on Russian gas

But the Yakov Gakkel can also do something most other LNG tankers cannot, for that enormous blue double hull allows it to carve through ice, enabling it to travel up into the Arctic Circle and back even in the depths of winter.

And that is precisely what this ship does, more or less constantly: travelling back and forth between Siberia and Europe, through winter and summer, bringing copious volumes of gas from Russia to Europe. It is part of the explanation for how Europe never ran out of gas, even after the Russian invasion of Ukraine.

This is not, it's worth saying, the conventional wisdom. Back when Russia invaded Ukraine, European policymakers declared they planned to eliminate the continent's reliance on Russian gas - which accounted for roughly a third of their supplies before 2022.

And many assumed that had already happened - especially after the Nord Stream pipeline, the single biggest source of European gas imports, was sabotaged in late 2022. But while volumes of Russian pipeline gas into Europe have dropped dramatically, the amount of Russian LNG coming into Europe has risen to record levels.

Image: LNG tankers sail between Siberia and various ports in Europe, including Zeebrugge

Russia helps Europe replenish gas stores

Today, Europe still depends on Russia for around 15% of its gas, an ever-growing proportion of which now comes in via the sealanes, on tankers like the Yakov Gakkel. And while the US has stepped in to make up some of the volumes lost when those pipelines stopped, only last month Russia overtook the US to become the second biggest provider of gas to the continent. It's further evidence that those LNG volumes carried on ships through the North Sea, the Irish Sea and the English Channel, are increasing, rather than falling.

This Russian gas has helped Europe replenish its gas stores, it has helped keep the continent's heavy industry going throughout the Ukraine war. And this dependence has not come cheap: the total amount Europe has paid Russia for LNG since 2022 comes to around €10bn.

The continued presence of Russian gas running through European grids is at least part of the explanation for why European energy prices have fallen so sharply since those post-invasion highs. Back then, many in the market were pricing in a complete end of Russian gas supply to Europe - something that would have had disastrous consequences. But it never actually happened.

Perhaps this explains why the continent's politicians have, so far, stopped short of banning imports of Russian gas: they are aware that their economy would struggle to withstand another sharp spike in inflation - which would almost certainly eventuate if it stopped taking Russian gas altogether.

Image: Russian gas has helped keep Europe's heavy industry going throughout the Ukraine war

This week, European leaders agreed to stop allowing Russia to use its ports to ""trans-ship"" its LNG - essentially acting as a stop-off point towards other destinations. However, those transshipments account for only a fraction - at most a quarter - of the Russian gas coming in on tankers to Europe. The vast majority ends up in Belgium, France and Spain, heating European homes, fuelling power stations and powering machinery in factories.

While European leaders have imposed wide-ranging sanctions and price caps on shipments of oil, no such controls exist for liquefied natural gas. So the Yakov Gakkel and a fleet of LNG tankers carry on sailing between Siberia and various ports in Europe - Zeebrugge, Dunkirk, Montoir and Bilbao - keeping the continent supplied with the Russian hydrocarbons it still cannot live without.

British firm's role in lucrative trade

But there is another reason why this ship is particularly unique, for the Yakov Gakkel - this critical cog in the financial machine that helps finance the Russian regime - is actually part-owned and operated by a British company.

That brings us back to a street overlooking the Clyde in Glasgow, where, in a glass-fronted office block, you will find the operational headquarters of a company called Seapeak. The chances are you haven't heard of Seapeak before, but this business owns and operates a fleet of LNG tankers all across the world.

That fleet includes the Yakov Gakkel and four other LNG icebreakers that ply this Siberian trade. That a British company might be facilitating this lucrative trade for Russia might come as a surprise, but there is nothing illegal about this: the sanctions regime on Russia just turns out to be significantly more porous than you might have thought.

We tried repeatedly to speak to Seapeak - to ask them about the Yakov Gakkel and whether they felt it was appropriate - given the UK has forsworn LNG imports - that a British company and British workers are helping administer this Russian trade. We sent emails with questions. However, they did not respond to our calls or our emails.

When, after weeks of efforts to get a response, I visited their offices in Glasgow, I was met by a security guard who told me Seapeak would not see me without an appointment (which they were refusing to give me). Eventually I was told that if I would not leave they would call the police.

Image: A security guard at Seapeak's offices in Glasgow said no one was available to speak to Sky News

Seapeak is not the only British company helping keep Russian gas flowing. While British insurers are banned from protecting oil tankers carrying Russian crude, there's no equivalent sanction on Russian LNG ships, with the upshot that many of these tankers are insured by British companies operating out of the Square Mile.

We spent some time tracking another icebreaking tanker, the Vladimir Rusanov, as it approached Zeebrugge. It is insured by the UK P&I Club, which also insures a number of other LNG carriers.

In a statement, it said: ""The UK Club takes great care to observe all applicable sanctions regulations in relation to Russian energy cargoes, but the direct carriage of LNG from Yamal to Zeebrugge, and provision of insurance services for such carriage, is not presently sanctioned. If the EU and G7 nations were to change their policy… the Club would of course comply by adjusting or withdrawing its services, as necessary.""

Image: The Vladimir Rusanov off the coast of Zeebrugge

The transport of Russian gas into Europe - its dependence on British operators and insurers - is only one small example of the loopholes and omissions in the UK sanctions regime. But while government ministers have expressed concern about the effectiveness of the broader sanctions regime, there is still scant evidence they intend to tighten up this corner of it.

Before the election was called the Treasury Select Committee was in the middle of collecting evidence for its own inquiry into the regime, which was expected to focus on insurers of vessels taking Russian goods. However, the inquiry was wound up prematurely when the election was called in May.

In the meantime, ships like the Yakov Gakkel carry on taking billions of cubic metres of gas from the gas fields of Yamal in Siberia down to Europe, in exchange for billions of euros. And those and other hydrocarbon revenues are one of the main explanations for how Russia is able to produce more missiles and weapons than the Ukrainians.

So Europe carries on fuelling its industry and its power and heating grids with molecules of gas coming from Siberian gasfields, while assuring itself it's doing everything it can to fight Vladimir Putin.

It is, in short, a discomforting situation. But given the alternative is to induce another cost of living crisis, there is little appetite in Europe to change things.","Because this is one of the world's most advanced liquefied natural gas (LNG) tankers, with an unusual trick up its sleeve.

A selective fee-paying school, Hulme is one of around 2,500 independent schools that educate 7% of the school population, a minority that is the target of one of Labour's few unapologetically tax-raising policies.

If elected, Labour says it will end the VAT exemption on fees, making them subject to 20% tax, raising an estimated £1.6bn the party says will be used to hire 6,500 teachers in the state sector that educates 93% of children.

Private school parents fear the increase will be passed on directly, pricing some children out, while industry bodies claim some schools will close.

Oldham is one of the poorest towns in England and Hulme is one of the country's more affordable independent schools, its fees around the national average and well short of the £50,000 charged by Eton and the prime minister's alma mater Winchester College.

Headteacher Tony Oulton, state educated and with experience working on both sides of Britain's educational divide, says Labour's policy misrepresents the majority of private schools and punishes parents.

""The sector is not Eton or Harrow or Winchester, the big posh boarding schools largely based in the south of England.

""The majority is made up of schools like mine where parents are making real sacrifices to pay the school fees because that's how they are choosing to prioritise their spending.""

'They are prioritising education the way some prioritise holidays'

Even without the Labour policy, fees at Hulme will rise 5.5% next year, a figure Mr Oulton says reflects the wider costs pressures, primarily wages for teachers. He says he cannot absorb the VAT rise without sacrificing the 24-child class size limit he believes parents are paying for.

""I lament the political debate, the loss of nuance and insight into the impact on children.

""The idea they are buying privilege and separation would not resonate with parents here. They don't recognise the rhetoric that sits around this, that they are part of some privileged elite. They are prioritising education the way some prioritise holidays.""

Privately educated children do nevertheless enjoy advantages. At £15,000 the average fee is double the £7,500-per-head funding in the state sector, and selection allows independent schools to choose who they want to educate.

Analysis by the Institute for Fiscal Studies meanwhile shows that private school attendance is concentrated among the wealthiest households, with three quarters of pupils drawn from the 30% of highest earners, and most from the top 10%.

This perhaps explains why Labour has felt able to concentrate one of its few openly tax-raising policies on the sector.

It argues that the needs of the state system, relied on by 93% of parents, make it popular while unspoken is the possibility that complaints of those who can afford fees in the first place will elicit little sympathy.

They are relaxed too about warnings that increasing fees will lead to an exodus of pupils that will put state schools under pressure.

Private school rolls have remained constant despite average fees increasing almost 50% in the last decade, and state secondary registers are forecast to fall 7% in the next decade as a population bulge passes through the system.

State education is facing undeniable challenges, including recruitment and retention, with one in four teachers leaving after three years in classrooms.

The growth in demand for special educational needs provision is also putting schools and local authorities under pressure. Some 576,000 children had an active education and health plan in January, almost as many as the total private school roll of around 615,000.

Headlands School in Bridlington faces typical challenges, all while working to clear a £1m deficit from its budget.

Assistant head teacher Adam Woolley said the issues for state education go beyond the school gate.

""It is not just about school funding but funding all the services around young people. A million people are in child poverty so there is only so much schools can do if children come in hungry, cold and without that stable foundation,"" he says.

""I take the argument from private schools and parents that it is a squeeze on people being aspirational for their children, but all parents are aspirational. State schools can and absolutely should be a place where you can send your child and aspire to great things, but that needs funding.""","Private school parents fear the increase will be passed on directly, pricing some children out, while industry bodies claim some schools will close.

Unite is suspending its industrial action, it said, after the news on Thursday that the Indian conglomerate owner, Tata, would, in response, close the site earlier than first announced.

Talks throughout the weekend yielded a ""significant development"" in the form of an agreement from Tata to discuss future investment and not just redundancies, the union said.

The closure date is now 7 July, the day before the previously planned strike and roughly two months before the September timeline originally announced to close the final blast furnace in which steel is made.

Up to 2,800 jobs are to be lost - 2,500 in the next year, and a further 300 in three years - despite a £500m taxpayer cash injection to support the site's transition to cheaper, greener steel production to cut emissions.

The first steel blast furnace was due to close at the end of June in a push to reduce carbon emissions at what is the UK's single largest source of CO2.

The previous fossil-fuel-powered blast furnaces are being replaced by a single electric arc furnace.

In February, research by CBI economists found the 9% growth in the UK's net zero economy had far exceeded general GDP growth of around just 0.1% in the last year, indicating the need for a clear green plan to attract private investment.

The research suggested the next government could add as much as £57bn to the economy from green growth by 2030.

Green issues were high up the agenda during the last UK general election in 2019, after protests by Extinction Rebellion (XR), school strikes led by Greta Thunberg and a ban on fracking had all been making headlines.

But while last time parties were clamouring to come up with the biggest tree-planting pledge, this year it has been made a wedge issue, dividing the parties.

The CBI leader will call on both main parties to commit to delivering steps to achieving green growth.

""The next government has got to be loud and proud in making green growth part of a new investor pitch for Brand Britain,"" she will say.

""No more prevarication, no more rowed back commitments. Whoever forms the next government has to let the world know it's serious about the investment opportunities from net zero and that we're in this for the long haul. Make decisions and stick to them.""

She will add that businesses want the creation of an Office for Net Zero to co-ordinate action across government departments.

""It's a dangerous error to try and separate [the economy] from net zero.

Mr O'Hare, who will join BlackRock as a vice-chair, said today: ""BlackRock is known for excellence in both investment management and financial technology, and together we can accelerate our efforts to deliver better private markets data and analytics to all of our clients at scale.

""I look forward to joining BlackRock and continuing to play a role in the continued growth and success of Preqin and our customers.""

High-flying O'Hare

Preqin is not the first business to have been built and sold by 65-year old Mr O'Hare.

Educated at the University of Cambridge, where he graduated with a first in Mathematics and Mathematical Statistics, Mr O'Hare - who also represented his college in rowing - went on to study finance at London Business School before joining Boston Consulting Group (BCG), advising clients in Europe, the US and Africa across several industries including financial services, healthcare, retail, industrial and consumer products.

After seven years at BCG, Mr O'Hare - who was born in London but was raised in Glasgow and speaks with a slight Scottish accent - left in 1986 to set up an independent consultancy called Goodall, Alexander, O'Hare & Co. Then, in 1993, he launched Citywatch, a provider of financial information which specialised in the monitoring and measuring of UK equity ownership.

He sold the business to Reuters in 1998 for a reported £2.5m - four-fifths of which went to him - and left the following year reunited with his former colleague Chris Goodall to set up e-Acorn.com, a business launched to provide seed funding and advice to internet start-ups.

While the bursting of the dot-com bubble put paid to those plans, Mr O'Hare - a part-time pilot who in June 1999 crash-landed his Piper Seneca seven-seat light aircraft - resurfaced in 2003 to launch Private Equity Intelligence, or Preqin.

As private equity grew in importance as an asset class, so too did Preqin, which in 2016 acquired Baxon Solutions as a way of providing its data and solutions via the cloud. It sold the business three years later but two years on from that, in 2021, snapped up a private markets technology, services and administration business called Colmore.

Preqin Academy

Around the same time it also launched Preqin Academy as a free online resource for students, early-career professionals and market participants wanting to learn more about the alternative assets industry.

Mr O'Hare, a frequent correspondent to the letters pages of the Financial Times down the years, stepped down as chief executive in 2022 and it was reported that the business had been put up for sale.

The sale price, though, is considerably higher than the initial £1bn valuation that was originally touted. The FT reported today that the ratings and financial data giant S&P had expressed an interest in Preqin, as had Bloomberg, the terminals giant.

Preqin is the latest big-ticket acquisition involving a data provider.

IHS Markit, another UK-founded business, was acquired in 2020 for £32bn by S&P while the same year saw the London Stock Exchange Group (LSEG) pay Thomson Reuters £20bn for its financial and risk business Refinitiv.

Fast-growing private markets sector

For BlackRock, the attraction of Preqin is that it takes the funds giant further into the fast-growing field of private markets, an area of growing interest to fund managers and their clients.

Rob Goldstein, chief operating officer at BlackRock, noted that the company had been a client of Preqin for a number of years.

He added: ""BlackRock's vision has always been to bring together investments, technology, and data to offer solutions that meet our clients' needs across their whole portfolio.

""As clients increasingly evolve their focus from choosing products to constructing portfolios, this shift requires technology, data, and analytics that create a 'common language' for investing across both public and private markets. We see data powering the industry across technology, capital formation, investing, and risk management.""

Away from work, Mr O'Hare and his South African-born wife Lindy, who have four children, have other passions.

Thorington Theatre

The couple own Stone House Farm, a Grade-II listed farmhouse near Southwold on the Suffolk coast, where in 2019 - just before the pandemic - they decided to build an open-air theatre in a patch of woodland where there was a natural clearing as a result of a Second World War bomb.

Thorington Theatre, a 350-seat venue, welcomed its first audiences in June 2021. Initially, the couple thought the venue would just be used by local theatre and amateur dramatic groups, but it rapidly became much bigger.

Mrs O'Hare, a former interior designer, told The Stage last year her ultimate ambition was to have the Royal Shakespeare Company bring a production of A Midsummer Night's Dream to the theatre.

But she added: ""One day, Ed Sheeran will come. He lives at Framlingham, so he's only down the road. That's the dream.""

A greater proportion of take-home pay is going on mortgage bills, according to the lender's house price index.

Someone earning the average UK income seeking to buy their first home with a deposit worth 20% of the asking price will have a monthly mortgage bill of 37% of their end pay packet.

It's above the long-standing average of 30%.

The mortgages affect

While people have been typically earning more and house prices are 3% lower than the all-time high two years ago, rising mortgage costs have made unaffordability worse.

Please use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player 3:44 Lloyds Banking Group chief executive Charlie Nunn said the era of ultra low interest rates is over.

With high interest rates - raised to 5.25% by the Bank of England to bring down inflation - have come more expensive mortgage costs.

According to Nationwide, the interest rate on a five-year fixed-rate deal for a borrower with a 25% deposit was 1.3% in late 2021. That has soared and is now around 4.7%.

Latest official figures showed basic pay grew 6% in the three months to April, while inflation - the rate of price rises - was 2.3% in the same month. But data from living-standards thinktank the Resolution Foundation said weekly wages have increased by just £16 in 14 years when inflation is factored in.

Compounding affordability problems is the fact UK house prices are back on the rise and were 1.5% more last month compared to June 2023.

Fewer mortgages, more cash

There have been fewer house-buying transactions over the past year, Nationwide added.

The total number of transactions is down by roughly 15% compared to the pre-pandemic year of 2019.

Higher borrowing costs have meant transactions involving a mortgage are down even more, nearly 25%.

Cash transactions, however, are up 5% on pre-pandemic levels.

Figures released by the Bank of England on Monday morning showed mortgage approvals continued to fall.

House sales are likely to fall as the number of mortgages approved dropped to 60,000 in May from 60,800 in April.

Would-be buyers borrowed half the amount of money to purchase a home, the Bank said, £1.2bn was loaned in May, down from £2.2bn in April.

The same data showed that personal lending, such as credit card debt and personal loans, grew. It suggests increased consumer demand.

The cap, which limits what suppliers can charge per unit of energy, fell by 7% overnight in the wake of the latest three-month review by industry regulator Ofgem.

The reduction meant that typical 12-month bills will be around £500 cheaper than a year ago.

It left the average bill at £1,568 - a figure that will apply until the result of the next review takes effect in October.

However, a report by the Energy & Climate Intelligence Unit (ECIU) said on Monday that consumers should brace for an additional hit of up to £600 over the coming winter, largely due to higher wholesale prices.

It pointed to a possible £200 price cap hike from October on the back of some analyst calculations, suggesting it was plausible the total could remain around that level until June.

One calculation, by experts at Cornwall Insight and released on Friday, predicted a 10% - or £155 - increase from 1 October to £1,723 a year but said there remained uncertainty on the market path ahead.

Consumer groups say there is an alternative to the price cap, pointing to a growing number of fixed-rate deals on the market following a dearth of competition in recent years.

Recent pressures have included strong competition from Asia, particularly China, for liquefied natural gas (LNG).

That has replaced some of the Russian natural gas volumes that were stripped away in the wake of the invasion of Ukraine in February 2022.

A planned extension of the European Union's sanctions regime against Russia will see its LNG exports targeted for the first time - potentially placing further pressure on supply across the continent.

UK household costs for both gas and electricity stood at an average of just below £1,090 ahead of the Russia-Ukraine war.

The ECIU report said: ""By September 2025, the average household could have paid an extra £2,600 on energy bills during the ongoing gas crisis.

""With the government also spending £1,400 per home earlier in the crisis, the total extra costs could be £4,000 per home, and counting.""

Energy has been among the big battlegrounds of the election.

Much of the debate has centred on costs but the impact of gas use in particular has fuelled argument too on the UK's climate commitments.

Dr Simon Cran-McGreehin, head of analysis at ECIU, said: ""The UK's high dependence on gas for electricity generation and heating has cost bill payers £2,000 so far during the gas crisis and the economy as a whole tens of billions of pounds.

""Common sense measures like investing in insulating the poorest homes, switching to electric heat pumps and fast-tracking British renewables will leave us less vulnerable to the whims of the international gas markets.

""North Sea gas output is declining so unless we make the switch we'll be ever more dependent on foreign imports.

""The maths is clear, when it comes to energy independence, new drilling licences are a side show making a marginal difference compared to the immense quantity of homegrown energy that offshore wind and other renewables can generate.""

She added: ""With the price cap predicted to rise again in October, many consumers will also be wondering whether to fix their energy deal.

Sky News has learnt that Mr Varley, who stepped down as the audit firm's chairman and managing partner in 2020, is to chair DWF, which is now majority-owned by the private equity firm Inflexion.

His appointment will be announced on Tuesday, according to insiders.

One said the recruitment of Mr Varley would underline the scale of DWF's ambition, nine months after it was taken private by Inflexion.

The former EY chief, who took on a global sustainability role at the big four accountant after leaving his UK role there, became one of Britain's most prominent business leaders during his nine years at the helm.

During his time running the firm, it doubled in size, closing the gap with rivals Deloitte, KPMG and PricewaterhouseCoopers.

Prior to joining Ernst & Young, Mr Varley worked at Accenture, while he subsequently became a member of advisory councils appointed by two prime ministers.

Then, however, the fuselage maker was flung into the spotlight when a Boeing 737 MAX jet operated by Alaska Airlines suffered a mid-air blow-out of a door plug.

Spirit, whose operation in Wichita, Kansas, had made the fuselage for the jet, saw its shares plunge by as much as 20% and found the quality of its work coming under heavy scrutiny as Boeing scrambled to convince regulators and customers that its aircraft were safe.

It subsequently emerged that the fuselage contained defective rivets but a preliminary report by the US National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) also found that four bolts needed to secure the door plug were missing - pointing to errors by Boeing's own workers at its plant at Renton, Washington.

Money latest:

'Bleak' new security measure seen in Tesco

One solution rapidly touted to resolve quality issues at both companies was for Boeing to acquire Spirit - which was originally part of Boeing but was spun off as a separate company in 2005.

The pair began negotiations in March this year and, today, an agreement was reached.

Boeing will pay $4.7bn (£3.7bn) in shares to acquire Spirit. It will also take on Spirit's debt - putting a total enterprise value on the business of $8.3bn (£6.6bn).

Image: The Alaska Airlines flight was forced to make an emergency landing with a hole in its fuselage in January. Pic: Reuters.

Separately, Spirit will pay Airbus $559m to take on work done for the European aircraft manufacturer at four of its plants. These include the production of A350 fuselage sections in Kinston, North Carolina and at Saint Nazaire on the west coast of France, as well as the production of wings and mid-fuselage for the A220 in Belfast.

The latter, which employs more than 3,000 people, is one of Northern Ireland's biggest private sector employers and its second biggest manufacturing employer.

The sale to Airbus marks the second time the operation has changed hands in five years. It was acquired by Spirit in 2019 from Canadian engineering combine Bombardier - which had itself bought the business, previously called Short Brothers, in 1989. Shorts, which was founded in 1908, famously claimed to be the world's first aircraft maker after receiving an order the following year from the aviation pioneers Wilbur and Orville Wright. It moved to Belfast in 1936.

The takeover of Spirit has taken a while to stitch together because of the involvement of Airbus which had, reportedly, been seeking compensation of $1bn for taking on the operations - which also include a site at Casablanca in Morocco.

The Airbus transaction - it is being compensated because the operations it is taking on are loss-making - has echoes of a deal that Airbus cut with Bombardier in 2017 to buy the latter's C-Series small jetliner programme for just $1. The jet was later renamed the A220.

Not included in the sale, though, are Spirit's other operations in Belfast which do work for customers other than Airbus and operations in Prestwick, South Ayrshire, that do support Airbus programmes. Spirit said today that it was seeking to sell these two businesses and a third one in Subang, Malaysia.

For Boeing, taking on the activities of its biggest supplier is hugely important in seeking to better integrate fuselage manufacturing into its overall processes, a key element in its aim of overseeing quality control more effectively.

As Dave Calhoun, Boeing's chief executive, put it: ""By reintegrating Spirit, we can fully align our commercial production systems, including our quality and safety management systems, and our workforce with the same priorities, incentives and outcomes, focused on safety and quality.

""We believe this agreement is in the best interest of the flying public, our airline customers, Spirit and Boeing employees, our shareholders and the country as a whole.""

One troubled company absorbs another

No one should be under any illusions, though, that this is one troubled company taking control of another troubled company.

Integrating Spirit and its 14,000 employees into Boeing will take a long time - and, accordingly, it will be some time before the company can convince its stakeholders that it has got to grips with quality issues at both Spirit and in its own operations.

It is also worth noting that the deal, which is not expected to close until the middle of next year, is being done in shares and not cash.

This is in order to protect Boeing's credit rating as the company, which has debts of nearly $58bn, fights to stave off a downgrade to 'junk' status.

Moody's joined S&P and Fitch in April in downgrading Boeing's credit rating to 'Baa3' (also known as triple-B minus) while all three have Boeing on a so-called 'negative outlook' list - which means it could be further downgraded in future. A downgrade to junk status would expose Boeing to the risk of some investors not being allowed to buy its bonds in future.

Brian West, Boeing's chief financial officer, told investors in April that the company - which burned through $4bn of cash in the first three months of the year - was making a priority of maintaining an investment grade rating.

In the meantime, Bloomberg reported over the weekend that Boeing is to be charged with fraud after violating the terms of a 2021 deferred prosecution agreement with the US Justice Department in May this year. That could expose the company to tens of millions of dollars worth of fines.

So, while this agreement with Spirit is probably a step in the right direction, Boeing still has numerous challenges with which to contend.

Who could take over as Boeing boss?

Perhaps the biggest question still being asked by investors is when the company will name a new chief executive to replace Mr Calhoun who, at the end of March, announced he would step down before the end of the year.

Stephanie Pope, a long-time Boeing executive who was made chief operating officer earlier this year, is the top internal candidate but Boeing is thought to be keen to hire a new broom from outside the company.

That process, though, has taken time. The Wall Street Journal reported last month that Larry Culp, the chief executive of GE Aerospace, had turned down the role - while others linked with it include Wes Bush, the former chief executive of the aerospace and defence giant Northrop Grumman.

Greg Smith, the chair of American Airlines and a former Boeing chief financial officer, is another who has been tipped.

The most intriguing would-be candidate, though, is Pat Shanahan, who became Spirit's chief executive in October last year and who previously spent 31 years at Boeing, as well as having a spell as US deputy secretary of defence. He has been at the centre of the negotiations to sell Spirit to Boeing and can now be seen as the front-runner.","Separately, Spirit will pay Airbus $559m to take on work done for the European aircraft manufacturer at four of its plants.

Article Thesis

Rolls-Royce Holdings plc (OTCPK:RYCEY) is an aerospace supplier that has performed well over the last year, but the longer-term past is pretty checkered. Shares have gotten rather expensive in recent months, I believe, which makes me believe that Rolls-Royce is not the best pick for aerospace exposure.

Company Overview

While the name Rolls-Royce may sound a bell when it comes to luxurious automobiles, these are not manufactured by Rolls-Royce Holdings plc. Instead, the Rolls-Royce automobile business, called Rolls-Royce Motor Cars, belongs to BMW Group (OTCPK:BMWYY). Rolls-Royce Holdings is a company that designs, produces, and sells power and propulsion systems, primarily for aircraft, but also for sea and land vehicles, with some on-site (stationary) power systems being sold on top of that.

Rolls-Royce has a history dating back way more than 100 years and its product line-up has, of course, changed significantly over that time. Airplane engines did not exist when Rolls-Royce Holdings was founded in 1884, and neither did nuclear-powered submarines and other products for which Rolls-Royce has become a supplier over the years and decades. But while Rolls-Royce's history is long, it is checkered -- the company has not been running from success to success and even had to declare bankruptcy in 1971. As we can easily see in the following chart, the last twenty years were far from perfect as well:

Data by YCharts

Rolls-Royce's revenues rose relatively consistently from the beginning of the century to 2014, before trailing off for a couple of years. During the initial phase of the pandemic, when many aircraft were grounded due to travel restrictions, revenues took a big hit, although the company has recovered quickly as the pandemic waned. Still, revenues are around 10% below all-time highs right now, which, factoring in inflation over the last decade, is quite meaningful.

The company's share price fared even worse, however -- Rolls-Royce currently trades at around one-fourth of the all-time high price seen a decade ago. When a company sees its shares drop this much, there must be major issues at play, especially when we consider that the broad market (SPY) has almost tripled over the last decade. While investors turned $10,000 in the S&P 500 into $27,000, before dividends, over the last decade, a $10,000 investment in Rolls-Royce at the highs from 2014 would have turned into a measly $2,700.

We also see that the descent began way before the pandemic; thus, while the pandemic caused temporary headwinds, Rolls-Royce Holdings' issues began before that. Looking at the company's past results, we see that Rolls-Royce Holdings generated losses for a couple of years, in 2016 and from 2018 to 2020. With losses of up to $5 billion per year, the company lost tremendous amounts of money even while generating solid revenues. The issue thus was clearly on the cost side, not on the revenue side. Rolls-Royce Holdings had to write down more than $4 billion of assets in 2016, its worst year from a net income perspective, with these write-downs being mainly related to currency hedges and other financial items.

Cost-cutting programs followed, and Rolls-Royce let go of thousands of people, which, of course, caused additional one-time expenses in the following years due to severance payments, etc. With the pandemic causing airlines to reduce their orders and with supply chain issues resulting in lower aircraft production numbers, the next problems appeared, although Rolls-Royce Holdings wasn't at fault when it came to the pandemic -- it was unlucky to be active in an industry that was hit harder than many others.

The good news is that Rolls-Royce Holdings has seen its operating performance improve markedly since the pandemic, as revenues have risen sharply and as the restructurings have begun to pay off, with Rolls-Royce Holdings seeing an improved cost structure that allowed the company to generate a nice $3.1 billion net profit last year -- the highest since 2017.

Rolls-Royce Holdings: Active In Growth Markets

And in 2024 and beyond, Rolls-Royce Holdings could see ongoing business growth as well. The company is forecasted to see its revenues expand by 9% this year, with revenue growth for 2025, 2026, and 2027 being forecasted at 8%, 7%, and 6%, respectively, using the Wall Street analyst consensus estimate.

This growth will likely be driven across several of Rolls-Royce Holdings' business units. First, the civil airplane market is experiencing nice growth, and the company will benefit as a major civil aircraft engine manufacturer. Global air travel numbers continue to rise, despite high costs and environmental concerns. Growth is driven by countries with fast economic growth such as India. Over the last couple of years, Indian airlines have made massive new aircraft orders, as these carriers want to expand their fleets considerably in order to service the growing domestic market as well as increasing demand for international travel. Around a year ago, Seeking Alpha reported a gigantic 500 aircraft order from India's IndiGo, and other Indian carriers such as Akasa Air have recently made huge orders as well. While not all of these airplanes will use engines from Rolls-Royce Holdings, overall growth in the civil aircraft market will be beneficial for Rolls-Royce for sure. India is not the only growing market, as China is seeing growing airline travel as well, and even in lower-growth markets such as Europe, airlines want to improve their fuel efficiency and are thus upgrading their fleets to bring down emissions and fuel expenses -- which means that new, more efficient engines are needed.

Rolls-Royce Holdings' second major market, defense equipment, is growing as well. Due to a range of conflicts around the world, many militaries are upping their defense spending. In the United States, military spending has been growing for years as well:

US military spending (statista.com)

Rolls-Royce Holdings benefits from increased military spending by the US, other NATO members, and other US allies via the sale of components such as military aircraft engines, naval engines, and even nuclear power plants for submarines. While the defense unit is smaller than the civil aircraft engine unit, it is still a meaningful contributor to Rolls-Royce Holdings' overall business growth.

Rolls-Royce Holdings' Power Systems and New Energy units are smaller, but some might argue that they could be major growth drivers in the future. After all, Rolls-Royce Holdings is working on small modular reactors (a type of nuclear power plant) that are seen, by some, including Bill Gates, as an important future source of electrical energy. Whether the concept is ultimately successful and economical is not yet known for sure, and we also don't know which of the companies in this space are best-positioned -- Bill Gates, for example, has funded one of Rolls-Royce's competitors. Small modular reactors are receiving funding from institutions such as the European Union, thus Rolls-Royce Holdings is active in a field that looks highly attractive, although success is, as mentioned above, not certain.

Rolls-Royce Holdings: Rather Expensive

So Rolls-Royce has a checkered past, partially due to company-specific issues and self-inflicted wounds, partially due to macro headwinds such as the pandemic. The outlook over the coming years is positive, but investors should also consider the company's valuation, which is rather high today.

Based on current estimates for this year, Rolls-Royce Holdings is trading for a little more than 28x net profits, which pencils out to an earnings yield of just 3.5% -- at a time when zero-risk treasuries yield much more than that. Of course, exceptionally strong growth may warrant a premium valuation, but Rolls-Royce Holdings' forecasted growth isn't extreme -- it is very solid, but far from Nvidia-like (NVDA). Even when we look at profit estimates for 2026, i.e. two years from now, the earnings multiple stands at 23, with forecasted growth between 2024 and 2026 being around 25% cumulatively, or around 12% per year. The PEG ratio is thus rather elevated, at around 2, making me believe that Rolls-Royce Holdings is not very attractively priced today.

Investors that want aerospace and defense exposure could instead opt for companies such as Lockheed Martin (LMT), trading at just 18x net earnings, offering a nice dividend, having a better track record, and offering nuclear power potential as well. Airbus (OTCPK:EADSY) trades for 26x forward earnings, is forecasted to grow by 12% per year in 2025 and 2026 as well, offers a dividend, and arguably has a bigger moat than Rolls-Royce while also benefitting from Boeing's (BA) problems.

Overall, Rolls-Royce Holdings is far from a bad company, but the stock is not trading at a valuation deserving of a ""Buy"" rating. For those who bought this company closer to the lows, it has been a great investment, but I wouldn't put new money into Rolls-Royce at more than 28x net profits.

Investment action

I recommended a buy rating for UniFirst Corp. (NYSE:UNF) when I wrote about it in January this year, as I expected the business to continue growing at a mid-to-high single-digit percentage. As the business scales, it should continue to win share and expand margins. Based on my current outlook and analysis, I recommend a buy rating. My key update to my thesis is that I am now more confident that UNF can continue to expand margins as it scales, especially with the success that management has seen with its merchandise costs. However, the mixed revenue growth outlook has forced me to reset my expectations lower. That said, I believe the market is focused on UNF’s ability to expand margins; hence, so long as UNF can continue to grow margins while growing top line in line with guidance, valuation should rerate upwards.

Review

UNF reported 3Q24 earnings last week, where its revenue grew 4.1% organically. By segment, Core Laundry, which is the largest segment (88% of total 3Q24 revenue), grew by 4.7% organically, while the other two smaller segments: Specialty Garments declined by 3.7%, and First Aid grew by 6.9% organically. Adj EBIT margins saw a strong expansion of 130bps to 8.7% (adjust for the $3.9 million in key initiative cost), driven by Core Laundry's adj EBIT margins expansion of 170bps to 7.7%. At the EPS level, UNF reported an adj. EPS of $2.19. On a GAAP basis, year-to-date earnings have tracked well ahead of my $123 million expectation previously (annualized year-to-date earnings = $134 million).

At the top line, organic revenue growth expectations are quite mixed. Starting with the positives. Core Laundry growth was solid at 4.7% organically, and this is consistent with the past 2 quarters (5.2% in 1Q24 and 4.8% in 2Q24). I continue to be positive about the growth outlook for this segment as UNF continues to win new logos (in particular, UNF saw strong traction with large accounts) and benefit from previous pricing actions. Therefore, I think the visibility of positive organic growth is very likely. What was worrying is that management noted multiple growth headwinds. For example, UNF witnessed a step-up in client churn rates, net wearer levels fell, and pricing increases for current clients became more difficult. And because of these headwinds, management guided Core Laundry organic growth (on a same-day basis) to decelerate to 3.5% in 4Q24 (from the 4.7% organic growth on a same-day basis seen in 3Q24). FY25 Core Laundry organic growth on a same-day basis was also guided to be more modest than 4Q24. That said, I am not too eager to turn super negative on the FY25 guidance yet, as I believe a part of the slower growth is due to the lapping of large national account wins. Also, management sounded quite positive that FY25 revenue could see upside if they win more national accounts.

Despite a mixed revenue outlook at the topline, UNF did deliver on margin expansion, and this supports my point that as UNF scales, its margin should continue to expand (on track to meet >10% EBIT margin). Importantly, 3Q24 Core Laundry performance (7.7% adj EBIT margin, an expansion of ~170bps vs. 3Q23) showed the market that the 2Q24 adj EBIT margin decline (from 8.6% in 1Q24 to 4.3% in 2Q24) was not indicative of a structural impairment to margins. Although 100bps of the ~170bps expansion was driven by tailwinds from lapping elevated healthcare claims and legal reserves in the prior year quarter, the notable aspect was that UNF saw 70bps of structural improvements from favorable trends in merchandise, payroll, and other operating input costs. Since merchandise amortization costs have been a consistent headwind for a while now, hearing about the improvement in merchandise costs was very encouraging. We can see that management has put in a lot of effort and has seen success in recent quarters. For instance, merchandise cost went from being a 20bps headwind to Core Laundry's EBIT margin in 1Q24 to a 20/30bps tailwind in 3Q24.

Looking ahead, on a consolidated basis, management maintained its FY24 revenue guide of $2.415 to $2.425 billion but raised GAAP EPS range to $7.17 to 7.49. If we adjust back for the key initiative costs, this implies a midpoint adj EPS guide of $7.81, or ~$147 million adj net income.

All in all, despite the mixed messaging at the topline, I was very encouraged by the margin performance and the underlying drivers. The revised EPS guide was also supportive of the fact that margins are expanding nicely, which is supportive of my bull thesis. Given that the market has reacted very positively (stock was up 13.5% post-results) on this set of results, I am inclined to believe that the market is focused on margin expansion more than topline performance.

Valuation

Author's work

Given the mixed topline outlook, I have revised my growth expectations downward accordingly to reflect reality (the fact that management called out those headwinds for two consecutive quarters suggests that they are stickier than expected). Using the qualitative comment provided for FY25, I assumed growth to be 3.4% (similar levels to 4Q24), followed by a recovery back to 5% in FY26 (assuming that it can at least recover back to mid-single-digit levels as the economy gets better).

However, for margins, I am much more positive considering the performance seen in 4Q23. The step-up in guidance was extremely encouraging as well. Using the revised guidance, it implies GAAP earnings of $137 million for FY24, or 5.7% net margin, which is 60bps above my previous estimates. I have increased my margin expectations by 60bps for the next two years as well.

Overall, I believe the bull case for UNF is still tracking well, and margins can continue to expand as the business scales. While growth is not as good as I thought, I believe the mentioned headwinds are likely to stem from the weak macroenvironment rather than UNF mis-execution. As such, I still expect UNF to see its valuation revert back to its historical average of 23x over the next 2 years.

Risk

If organic growth continues to worsen, falling behind my estimates (or management guidance) by a wide margin, this may force the market to shift its focus from margin expansion to topline growth weakness. This could happen if the macro situation turns for the worse, and it is a fact that UNF is already seeing some negative impacts from this.

Final thoughts

My recommendation is a buy for UNF. While top-line growth is encountering headwinds, UNF ability to expand margins remains impressive. Strong Core Laundry segment performance and management's success in controlling merchandise costs gave me more confidence that UNF can continue to scale profitably. The market's positive reaction to the latest earnings report made me believe that its focus is more on margin expansion. The key risk lies in a significant deterioration of organic growth, potentially causing the market to prioritize top-line performance over margin expansion.","However, the mixed revenue growth outlook has forced me to reset my expectations lower.

Oscar Health (NYSE:OSCR) turned profitable in Q1 2024 and is expected to be profitable for the year. This is likely sustainable, as the company could maintain profitability in future years as well. The reason for the sustainability of profits is due to Oscar Health's efforts to reduce expenses, by gaining variable cost efficiencies, by increasing fixed cost leverage, and through lower risk adjustment as a percentage of premiums. The stock's recent pullback could present a good buying opportunity. However, there are some uncertainties to be aware of beyond 2025.

Oscar Health's Business Background

Oscar Health provides health insurance in the United States, where the company scaled up to over 1 million members. OSCR's insurance includes health plans for individual and small group markets. The company also offers +Oscar, a tech platform that assists providers and payors to shift to value-based care. Oscar Health also offers reinsurance products. The company is focused on optimizing its member experience and its cloud-based platform.

Oscar Health's Profitability Improvements and Growth Catalysts

Oscar Health's efforts to increase margins to improve profitability is the main catalyst for the company going forward. OSCR has been increasing margins through multiple strategies. One strategy is scaling up and driving membership growth to increase revenue growth. Revenue increased by an impressive 46% in Q1 2024 to $2.1 billion over Q1 2023. The strong growth was attributed to above-average membership growth during open enrollment SCP (specialty care provider) member additions, while achieving strong retention. Oscar Health is diligent with offering competitive prices, which helps to grow memberships.

Another strategy was to pull out of the Medicare Advantage business, which was not profitable for Oscar. OSCR felt that the provider relationships that were in place were not sustainable and that they were not able to fix the situation to convert them into profits. The large increase in revenue growth plus the exiting of the Medicare business resulted in Oscar achieving its first profitable quarter. The operating margin was just under 9%, the EBITDA margin was 9%, and the net income margin was 8% for Q1 2024 as compared to negative margins in Q1 2023 and all previous quarters prior to 2024.

Oscar Health has been building its overall strategy around the current trends in the healthcare industry. This includes consumerization, digitization, and the shift to personalization. OSCR's strategy to capitalize on these trends includes: retaining existing members, acquiring new members, introducing new products/health plans, expanding into new markets & lines of business, and by monetizing its +Oscar platform.

The +Oscar platform addresses consumerization (adapting technology and tools to meet consumer's needs) by directing members to the right care at the right time. The platform takes complex member-specific workflows and turns it into a user-friendly experience for non-technical users. The platform uses digitization as it converts member information into digital form. It addresses the shift to personalization by building trust and engagement with members as the platform routes members to care that is specific to their needs while saving them money.

Here are some statistics that back up the claims regarding the +Oscar platform:

9x higher mobile app downloads

90% member retention

13% ER reduction

15% increase in annual wellness visits

20% reduction in virtual no-show rates

75% of members use Care Router

2/3 choose a recommended provider

About 7% cost savings for members

20% administrative cost reduction for +Oscar partners

The exiting of the Medicare business and the strong scaling of revenue through Oscar's strategies and +Oscar platform should help to drive profitability going forward.

Attractive Valuation

Since Oscar Health hasn't been profitable prior to 2024, the price/sales ratio should be the most appropriate valuation measure for the stock. OSCR is trading with an attractively low trailing price/sales ratio of 0.55 and a forward price/sales of 0.42. P/S ratios below one are considered undervalued. The Healthcare Plan industry is also trading with an attractive low trailing P/S ratio of 0.61. Oscar is trading attractively below its industry.

The company is expected to achieve an impressive revenue increase of 51% in 2024 to $8.87 billion, according to consensus estimates from Oscar Health's four covering analysts. Oscar Health is off to a great start with the 46% revenue increase in Q1. I think Oscar can achieve its revenue estimate for the year as the company scales up with the +Oscar platform and its growth strategies.

Oscar is also expected to turn a profit for the full year of 2024 with an estimate for EPS of $0.05. This looks feasible with the strong increase in revenue and the elimination of the non-profitable Medicare business leading to an increase in margins.

Technical Perspective

Oscar Health (OSCR) Daily Stock Chart with RSI (TradingView)

The stock recently sold off significantly about 33%. This brought the stock down to an oversold condition on the RSI. The sell-off resulted from a downgrade from Bank of America (BAC). BoA downgraded OSCR to Neutral from a previous Buy rating. Bank of America stated that 85% of the direct policy premiums that Oscar's members paid were subsidized by advanced premium tax credits [APTCs]. These APTCs have been extended through 2025. However, the fear is that they could expire and not be extended after 2025. Bank of America put a 50% chance that the subsidies will expire. This is the biggest risk for Oscar Health in my opinion, as the expiration of subsidies could lead to less revenue growth and a narrowing of margins. The expiring of APTCs could cause Oscar to return to being unprofitable.

On the bright side from a technical perspective, there is a hidden bullish divergence on the daily chart. The stock made a higher low from April through June. At the same time the RSI made a lower low. This divergence typically results in a price reversal to the upside from what I have observed.

Of course, we may need to get clarification on an extension of the APTCs beyond 2025 to catalyze the stock to new highs. The stock could also experience a technical bounce higher since it is oversold and the company is likely to be profitable in 2024 and probably in 2025.

Another risk for Oscar Health is the potential failure to monetize its +Oscar platform. Oscar Health might be required to obtain licenses and approvals in new and existing markets including for 3rd party administrative services, pharmacy benefit administration, and other services. Obtaining these approvals could take longer than expected, leading to delays in earning revenue.

The company could also experience slower growth than it has in the past. Oscar Health could struggle to add new members or to retain existing ones. It is possible that members could find more attractive options in the Marketplace.

Oscar Health's Long-Term Investment Outlook

Currently, the uncertainty of the APTCs expiring or not beyond 2025 is weighing on the stock. News of an extension of the APTCs would likely catalyze the stock higher. In the meantime, the Q2 earnings report scheduled for August 8, 2024 could be a near-term catalyst. Also, there is the possibility of the stock to bounce higher from the current oversold condition.

The longer-term hinges on Oscar Health getting an extension for the APTCs. If the company assures investors that Oscar could thrive with an extension or not, it could cause the stock to return to an upward trajectory.

Oscar Health looks good at least through 2025. The valuation is attractive, and the company achieved profitability. However, potential investors may want to wait for more clarity on an extension of the APTCs. Because of that uncertainty, I would rate the stock a HOLD.","One strategy is scaling up and driving membership growth to increase revenue growth.

Elevator Pitch

I rate International Container Terminal Services, Inc. (OTCPK:ICTEF) [ICT:PM], or ICTSI, as a Buy. On its investor relations website, the company describes itself as the ""world's largest independent terminal operator across six continents"" which was ""established in December 1987 in the Philippines"" with its ""flagship operation, the Manila International Container Terminal.""

This is an update of my August 30, 2019 initiation piece for ICTSI. In the latest write-up, my focus is on the expectations for the company's FY 2024 financial performance, and its inorganic growth prospects. I raise my rating for ICTSI from a Hold to a Buy after considering the company's positive outlook. A tariff hike for the Manila International Container Terminal will help to boost the company's FY 2024 results, while ICTSI has both the intention and financial strength to engage in inorganic growth initiatives.

Investors should be aware that ICTSI's shares are traded on the Over-The-Counter market and the Philippine Stock Exchange. The trading liquidity for the company's OTC shares is low with a three-month mean daily trading value of slightly above $10,000 as per S&P Capital IQ data. ICTSI's Philippines shares boast a higher average daily trading value of $8 million (source: S&P Capital IQ) for the last three months. Readers can engage the services of Singapore's OCBC Securities and Hong Kong's Boom Securities to trade in ICTSI's comparatively more liquid Philippines-listed shares.

Expecting A Better Set Of Results For 2024 With Key Asset's Tariff Hike

The company's most recent Q1 2024 financial performance was good, and ICTSI's full-year 2024 financial results are expected to be superior to that for 2023.

ICTSI's earnings per share or EPS grew by +37% YoY from $0.072 in Q1 2023 to $0.099 for Q1 2024. The company's actual first quarter bottom line beat the consensus EPS forecast of $0.08 (source: S&P Capital IQ) by +24%. Looking ahead, the sell side analysts are projecting that ICTSI's top line growth will accelerate from +6.5% last year to 10.0% this year. Also, the market sees the company's EBITDA margin expanding by +100 basis points to 64.0% for FY 2024. The consensus financial projections are obtained from S&P Capital IQ.

In the earlier part of this article, I indicated that ICTSI's key asset or ""flagship operation"" was ""the Manila International Container Terminal."" Also, the company's 2023 annual report reveals that the Manila International Container Terminal boasts a ""70% share of the international container traffic in Manila.""

A recent June 21, 2024 article posted on PortCalls Asia (ports industry news portal) noted that ""The Philippine Ports Authority approved the 16% increase in cargo-handling tariff at Manila International Container Terminal.""

ICTSI guided at the company's Q1 2024 analyst call (audio recording and transcript not publicly available) that its revenue per TEU or yield could potentially increase from $182 in the previous fiscal year to between $190 and $200 for the current fiscal year. It is realistic to think that the increase in tariffs for ICTSI's key Manila International Container Terminal asset will be supportive of the company's FY 2024 guidance pertaining to yield expansion.

Inorganic Growth Prospects

ICTSI has the intention to execute on inorganic growth initiatives, and the company has the financial capacity to support future acquisitions or investments.

At its earlier Annual Shareholders' Meeting in April this year, ICTSI stressed that it is ""actively looking for investments in regions"" where it has been ""successful"" like ""Asia, Latin America, Africa, and the Middle East."" It is reasonable to infer from the company's comments that ICTSI views inorganic growth as a key priority.

The company's cash flow generation is strong and its balance sheet is healthy. Free cash flow for ICTSI increased by +46% YoY to $358 million in the recent Q1 2024, which is equivalent to an impressive free cash flow margin of approximately 12%. As of March 31, 2024, the company's debt-to-EBITDA ratio was a reasonably manageable 1.8 times. ICTSI also has limited refinancing risks, considering its long weighted average debt maturity period of 4.7 years. The above-mentioned metrics were sourced from the company's Q1 2024 earnings presentation slides. ICTSI's trailing twelve months' interest coverage ratio is also decent at 3.7 times as per S&P Capital IQ data.

There is a potential near-term inorganic growth driver in sight for ICTSI. South African media publication The Mail & Guardian reported in April 2024 that ICTSI was chosen as ""the preferred bidder to partner in a 25-year joint venture to develop and upgrade"" the ""Durban Pier 2 Container Terminal."" This will be a significant deal for the company. The Durban Container Terminal ""handles 72 percent of the port’s throughput and 46 percent of South Africa’s port traffic"" and is referred to as ICTSI's ""largest operation in Africa"" as per the company's disclosures.

At its Q1 2024 analyst briefing, ICTSI noted that it remained confident that it can conclude the Durban Container Terminal transaction by the third quarter of the current year. This deal would have been completed even earlier in 1H 2024, if not for a legal case filed by Maersk (OTCPK:AMKBY) (OTCPK:AMKBF) (OTCPK:AMKAF), which lost the bid for the Durban Container Terminal. A May 7, 2024 Bloomberg report mentioned that Maersk ""seeks to overturn the award of a concession to run"" the Durban Container Terminal on the basis that ICTSI ""fell short of tender requirements."" A potential short-term re-rating catalyst for ICTSI will be the completion of the Durban Container Terminal deal, if and when Maersk is defeated or withdraws its lawsuit.

Even if the conclusion of the Durban Container Terminal transaction is delayed due to legal issues, ICTSI's inorganic growth prospects for the intermediate term remain bright. As mentioned above, the company has both the ability (financial strength) and the willingness (Annual Shareholders' Meeting comments) to identify and execute on new inorganic growth initiatives.

Variant View

Certain scenarios pose downside risks to ICTSI's outlook.

If there are unfavorable economic or political developments in the Philippines or other markets where the company's assets are located, ICTSI's actual volume or revenue growth might come in below expectations.

ICTSI could find it hard to execute on the company's inorganic growth strategy, if assets available for sale are overpriced or that regulators tighten their approval criteria for potential M&As or investments.

Final Thoughts

ICTSI's outlook is favorable as per my analysis outlined above, and the company's shares are undervalued. The stock's PEG (Price-to-Earnings) multiple is 0.74 times or below the 1 times that implies fair valuation. This is calculated based on its consensus next twelve months' normalized P/E of 17 times and its consensus FY 2023-2026 normalized EPS CAGR estimate of +23% (source: S&P Capital IQ).

Fashion and apparel in general has been seeing some turbulence lately. To name a few, Burberry (OTCPK:BURBY) and Kering (OTCPK:PPRUF), in higher fashion, saw just as intense declines as Nike (NKE) which has lately reported issues itself, although different in nature - more to do with upstarts taking share. Hugo Boss (OTC:HUGPF)(OTCPK:BOSSY) has noticeably overperformed, although still declined particularly from peaks.

Data by YCharts

In the case of Boss and the higher end fashion stocks, the situation has been a double-effect of both declining expendable income as the economy resets and rates take their toll. Fashion stocks have also been affected by the fallout from the Chinese economy, where East Asian demand has been an important buoy for these stocks over the past cycle. Part of Hugo Boss' relative outperformance has been the more limited APAC exposure compared to the likes of Kering, which allowed for growth. All declined on either weak/decelerating growth or guidance for weaker growth. With a pretty compressed multiple and latent earnings growth from some investments in their brick and mortar presence, we think the stock offers up a decent GARP proposition.

Earnings Comments

The first thing to call out are the geographies, since the Chinese exposure in this sector the market is important to track.

Geography (PR Q1)

Whereas Kering has around 35% of revenue from APAC ex-Japan, Boss has only around 14% of revenue from the ailing region, driven by the poor economic performance of China on the back of their real estate slump.

Segment (Q1 PR)

There was some investment going on into the brick and mortar retail locations. Higher payroll and rent, and all the other associated costs with expanding space, drove YoY increases in SG&A company-wide, even though components of SG&A, specifically marketing, is on the decline YoY. Admin expenses also came down as a consequence of incremental cost management. There is some latent growth to be expected here. Also, Q2 tends to be non-promotional, and the company is already baking in its current tenor of marketing expenses into guidance, which is seeing between 5-15% EBIT growth, with consequent growth in net income. Q2 topline will be tough to beat though, with Q2 2023 being a strong topline quarter - so comp effects will work against the coming quarter. But investments in retail should benefit from some operating leverage, as the bulk of improvements here have already been expended for. This is in spite of the more significant exposure to China in this segment. UK hasn't been great either. The company fully expects volume to drive the brick and mortar retail revenues, along with space, with no further price increases planned.

Incremental improvements in logistics and sourcing are going to create incremental margin. Current Q1 run-rate gross margins are below the range of 62-64%, expected from a mix of operating leverage as investments come to fruition and calmed down freight costs YoY.

Further on marketing, the company is targeting a range of 7-8% of revenues to be spent on marketing. They are suggesting that with some major Times Square campaigns as well as another campaign with tennis start Taylor Fritz, their current 7.5% rate of marketing spend may actually be somewhat on the high side, and there is space for some dozens of bps in reduction of costs here.

Bottom Line

The news coming out of other fashion stocks has definitely been more negative. Boss is on the back of a 100 mono-branded store increase in the last 18 months, and is seeing some idiosyncratic benefit there. They have less China exposure. The higher European exposure also means less volatility, since Europe has, in general, been neither bad nor good from a macro point of view. They have also managed to win share in Europe. The US is driving growth, consistent with the superior consumer environment, and in general, they have a more confident guidance profile. It helps that they are not designer-tier in fashion either. Their fundamentals are more in line with a company like G-III (GIII), which also occupies a similar strata of the fashion market, although with its idiosyncrasies around manufacturing licenses with Hilfiger and Calvin Klein. Their performance has similarly been better than some of the higher fashion groups.

At around 10x forward PE, and with a decent growth year planned as their sales grow into their newly established space and start driving some operating leverage over indivisible expenses, it is actually quite a compelling prospect. The other stocks mentioned are significantly higher multiple, at least 14x. Our concern is just around the entire fashion sector. When looking at the impact to shareholders of Nike from upstarts like On Holding (ONON) taking sudden share over the course of only a couple of years, the risks in the sector become evident, and it becomes necessary to augur trends in the industry. Furthermore, the US driver could become derailed if the consumer there eventually becomes affected by the current rate regimes, though the US consumer is appearing rather unstoppable and the Fed unlikely to raise rates beyond this point to protect systemic elements of the financial system. It's not uncompelling, but by no means a slam dunk on account of risks.

In the last few years, I covered several pharmaceutical companies - including Gilead Sciences, Inc. (GILD), Novo Nordisk A/S (NVO) or Eli Lilly and Company (LLY) - and wrote in one way or another about many different pharmaceutical companies. But one major pharmaceutical company I never wrote about is Pfizer Inc. (NYSE:PFE). The company is one of the oldest and major pharmaceutical companies in the world and among the top 10 pharmaceutical companies (according to market capitalization).

Data by YCharts

In the following article, I will look at Pfizer and try to answer the question if the stock could be a good investment after declining 54% from its previous all-time high.

Business Description

Pfizer is a company that probably needs no introduction, as most people (and investors) are familiar with the pharmaceutical company. Nevertheless, I will offer a short description anyway. Pfizer was founded in 1849 in New York by two Germans - Charles Pfizer and Charles F. Erhart. In the last 175 years, the company developed into one of the major pharmaceutical companies in the world, with about 88,000 employees and $60 billion in annual revenue. Pfizer is developing medicines and vaccines. In the last few years, Pfizer was especially known for its COVID-19 vaccines, but it is also offering pharmaceuticals for immunology, oncology, cardiology and neurology.

Quarterly Results

When looking at the last quarterly results, we see a company that doesn't seem to be in great shape. Total revenue declined from $18,846 million in Q1/23 to $14,879 million in Q1/24 - resulting in a 21.0% year-over-year decline. Income from operations also declined 43.7% YoY from $5,555 million in the same quarter last year to $3,128 million this quarter. And finally, diluted earnings per share declined from $0.97 in Q1/23 to $0.55 in Q1/24 - also resulting in a 43.3% YoY decline.

Pfizer Q2/24 Presentation

At first, the results seem horrible, and Pfizer seems to be in big trouble. However, there is a rather simple explanation for the results. In the last three years, Pfizer generated a lot of revenue with pharmaceuticals related to COVID-19 and with COVID-19 not being a major issue anymore, revenue from these products is declining.

When looking at the three different segments - Primary Care, Specialty Care and Oncology - it is especially Primary Care that got hit hard. Revenue declined 38% year-over-year to only $7,211 million in revenue, but as mentioned above, this was due to the pharmaceuticals used for COVID-19 treatment and vaccination. Comirnaty sales declined steeply from $3,064 million in the same quarter last year to only $354 million this quarter (88% YoY decline) and Paxlovid sales declined from $4,069 million in Q1/23 to $2,035 million in Q1/24 (50.0% YoY decline). When excluding these two, revenue for the Primary Care segment increased 8.9% year-over-year from $4,427 million to $4,822 million. Especially, Eliquis is a major contributor and generated $2,040 million in revenue and grew 8.9% year-over-year. The second major contributor is the Prevnar family, which generated $1,691 million in revenue and grew 5.6% year-over-year.

The second major segment is Specialty Care, which generated $3,843 million in total revenue and compared to the same quarter last year grew 6.3% YoY. Here we have a very diversified portfolio with only one blockbuster drug and several other drugs generating revenue in the hundreds of millions. Only the Vyndaqel family generated $1,137 million in quarterly revenue and was also the major driver of growth with a 66% YoY increase.

The third segment is Oncology, and this might be one of the most promising segments for Pfizer right now. In Q1/24, it generated $3,549 million in revenue and grew 18.4% year-over-year. The major blockbuster is Ibrance, which generated $1,054 million in revenue. However, year-over year, revenue declined 7.9%. Other major contributors to revenue were Xtandi generating $418 million in revenue (23.3% YoY growth), Padvec generating $341 million in revenue (has not been approved in Q1/23) and the portfolio of oncology biosimilars generating $264 million in revenue.

Growth

When looking at Pfizer's guidance for fiscal 2024, management is expecting revenue to be between $58.5 billion and $61.5 billion. Compared to fiscal 2023 results, this would result in 0% to 5% growth for the top line. Adjusted diluted earnings per share are expected to be between $2.15 and $2.35. And not only raised Pfizer its guidance from previously $2.05 to $2.25 in earnings per share, but this would also result in 17% to 28% bottom-line growth.

Pfizer Q2/24 Presentation

And when looking at the guidance we must take into account that Comirnaty generated $11,220 million in revenue in fiscal 2023 and Paxlovid generated $1,279 million in revenue. For fiscal 2024, Pfizer is expecting these two pharmaceuticals to generate only about $8 billion in revenue and the company therefore also must set off $4.5 billion in losses.

Pfizer Earnings Estimates (Seeking Alpha)

When looking not only and the current fiscal year but also the bigger picture, analysts are expecting earnings per share to grow in coming years, but in a few years from now, stagnation is expected again. Of course, it is extremely difficult to estimate revenue for a pharmaceutical company in 5 or 10 years from now due to patent losses and not knowing how the pipeline will turn out. And as a result, analysts are rather cautious about pharmaceutical companies in 5 or 10 years into the future.

The past is also showing us a rather messy picture. Of course, Pfizer grew with a high pace in the last few years and generated huge amounts of revenue and free cash flow. But that was due to COVID-19 and won't most likely not be repeated. In the years before, the business rather stagnated.

Data by YCharts

Nevertheless, we can be optimistic for the years to come and when asking the question of where future growth for Pfizer might come from, the answer could be the oncology segment and acquisitions. Different studies are expecting high growth rates for the oncology market and are expecting at least high single digit growth rates in the years to come (some studies are even expecting double-digit growth).

And recently, Pfizer completed a major acquisition. In mid-December, the company announced the completion of the $43 billion acquisition of Seagen. As part of this acquisition, Pfizer acquired four approved medications (and of course several other pipeline candidates). Seagen is especially focused on transformative cancer medicines. Pfizer acquired all outstanding common stock of Seagen for $229 in cash per share.

Balance Sheet

And of course, such a major acquisition also had an impact on the balance sheet. As a consequence of the acquisition, Pfizer has now (on March 31, 2024) only $719 million in cash and cash equivalents as well as $11,209 million in short-term investments on the balance sheet. This is still enough to operate and face no liquidity issues. But before the acquisition, Pfizer had as much as $41 billion in short-term investments on the balance sheet.

On March 31, 2024, Pfizer also had $8,232 million in short-term borrowing on the balance sheet as well as $61,307 million in long-term debt. This might seem like a high amount of debt, but we also have to take into account $92,558 million in shareholder's equity and this leads to an acceptable debt-equity-ratio of 0.75

Aside from comparing the total debt to total shareholder's equity, it is more important to compare the total debt to either the operating income or free cash flow, as those metrics will tell us how long it will take the company to pay off the debt. Usually, we take the operating income of the last four quarters, but in the case of Pfizer this was only $3,100 million - a number that is not really representative of the business. In the previous years, Pfizer also generated amounts close to $40 billion, but that is also not representative (as already mentioned above). A realistic amount would be $15 billion annually and when subtracting cash and short-term investments from the total debt, it would take Pfizer less than 4 years to repay the outstanding debt. This is not great, but acceptable, and Seagen will also contribute to operating income (not reflected in the numbers so far).

Risks

Despite all optimism about high potential growth rates for the oncology business, we should not ignore that Pfizer is generating the biggest part of revenue not from oncology. And when only oncology is growing with a high pace, this is not enough for the overall business to achieve meaningful growth rates. The primary care and specialty care business also must contribute to growth, otherwise Pfizer will not be able to grow overall revenue and earnings.

Annual Report Fiscal 2023

And of course, Pfizer is also facing the risk of biosimilars and other competitor's products once patent protection is lost. In the next two years, Pfizer will lose patent protection for Inylta, Xeljanz, Prevnar 13 and Eliquis. And all four are blockbusters generating at least $1 billion in annual revenue. Especially, Eliquis is generating $6.7 billion in annual revenue, and losing this kind of revenue would certainly be a major hit to Pfizer. And while more than $10 billion in annual revenue could be at risk here, scenarios are different. When a company loses patent protection for its products, it could lead to steeply declining revenues. But sometimes competitors are just not able to bring a similar product to the market that is also accepted by medical personnel and patients in a similar way.

Dividend

Pfizer could certainly be interesting for its dividend and a stock a dividend investor might buy. Right now, Pfizer is paying a quarterly dividend of $0.42, resulting in an annual dividend of $1.68 and is resulting in a dividend yield of 6.1%. And although bonds are paying a high yield, investing in Pfizer could make sense for investors seeking passive quarterly income. Pfizer is not a dividend king or dividend aristocrat but increased the dividend for 13 years in a row.

Of course, treasury bonds yield 4.3% right now (10-year treasury bond), but Pfizer not only has a higher dividend yield, but investors might also profit from a rising stock price. On the other hand, treasury bonds are extremely safe and in case of Pfizer we at least must add a question mark to the dividend safety. For fiscal 2024, earnings per share are expected to be $2.34 and this would result in a payout ratio of 72%, which is rather high and should make us cautious. In the last four quarters, the company paid $9,316 million in dividends but the generated free cash flow was only $5,106 million. This means that Pfizer is paying out much more in dividends than it generated in free cash flow.

Data by YCharts

Here we must look at the free cash flow in the last few years (or decades) to get a feeling what free cash flow might be realistic. Of course, we can't take the extremely high free cash flow of the last three years, Pfizer generated due to COVID-19 and offering a successful vaccine (in collaboration with BioNTech SE (BNTX)). However, when looking at free cash flow of the last 10 to 15 years, it seems reasonable to assume Pfizer can generate at least $10 billion in free cash flow, which would be enough to cover the dividend. We could be even a little more optimistic. In the last ten years, the company generated $15.5 billion in free cash flow on average, and we can assume that Pfizer can generate a similar free cash flow in the next few years.

Intrinsic Value Calculation

A final step in every analysis is the calculation of an intrinsic value for a stock to determine if we are also dealing with a great investment (a company can be a great business, but a stock does not automatically have to be a great investment).

We can start by looking at simple valuation multiples, but when looking at the price-earnings ratio we see that the company is not reporting a P/E ratio right now as the trailing twelve months EPS is negative. Instead, we can look at the price-free-cash-flow ratio. But as free cash flow declined constantly in the last few quarters (see section about the dividend), the P/FCF got higher and higher (despite a declining stock price). At the time of writing, Pfizer is trading for 33 times free cash flow.

Data by YCharts

In the last ten years, this is the highest price-free-cash-flow ratio Pfizer has been trading for. In the meantime, Pfizer is trading close to the lowest stock price in the last ten years. And here we already see that it is not so easy to reach a conclusion just based on simple valuation metrics.

Instead, we should rather use a discount cash flow calculation to determine an intrinsic value for the stock. Here we must make several assumptions. As always, we use the last reported diluted number of shares outstanding (5,697 million at the point of writing) and a 10% discount rate (as this is the annual return on our investment we like to achieve at least). I often take the free cash flow of the last four quarters as the basis for the calculation, but as already mentioned above, the numbers reported in the last few quarters might not be representative of the business.

In such a case, we can take the average free cash flow of the last 10 years as a realistic basis (of course, this is including the very successful years 2021, 2022 and 2023 during the COVID crisis). But I still think this is a realistic assumption to use in our calculation. Let's calculate with $15 billion in free cash flow. On the other hand, let's be rather cautious about the growth potential, as it seems very unlikely that Pfizer will suddenly grow at a high pace again. But assuming about 2-3% growth annually (in line with GDP) seems reasonable for Pfizer. This would lead to an intrinsic value of $37.61 for Pfizer, and the stock is undervalued at this point and might even consider a bargain.

Conclusion

Pfizer is certainly not a high growth business, but with its high dividend yield and cheap stock price, it seems like a mistake to ignore Pfizer at this point. We should expect Pfizer to grow only in the low to mid-single digits over the long run, as it also had troubles growing in the past, and we don't know if the growth stemming from acquisitions and the oncology business is enough. Nevertheless, Pfizer's stock seems to be undervalued at this point and maybe a good long-term investment and a rather recession-resilient business.","But one major pharmaceutical company I never wrote about is Pfizer Inc.

Large-cap growth was the star of the market show in the first half. ETFs tracking the upper-right corner of the US stock market style box returned more than 20%. Contrast that to tepid returns in value and among mid-caps. Small caps were basically flat, losing ground to both inflation and high cash yields.

Let’s revisit the Vanguard Mid-Cap Index Fund ETF Shares (NYSEARCA:VO). I had a buy rating in late October 2023, which proved to be a timely call as that was right near the bottom of the market correction in the second half of last year. But VO is up just 24% in total return since then, underperforming the S&P 500’s 30% return. “Higher for longer” interest rates and AI euphoria among the megacaps have been the primary drivers of VO’s negative alpha.

I reiterate a buy rating, but my mood is less sanguine today given a higher P/E ratio and uncertain technicals.

According to the issuer, VO seeks to track the performance of the CRSP US Mid Cap Index, which measures the investment return of mid-capitalization stocks. The ETF provides a convenient way to match the performance of a diversified group of mid-sized companies, and it follows a passively managed, full-replication approach. Yardeni Research points out that the S&P MidCap 400 trades at 15.6 times forward earnings estimates, about 5.5 turns cheaper than the S&P 500. That multiple is up about 3.5 handles from October last year.

VO is a large ETF with $163 billion in assets under management as of June 28, 2024. The fund sports strong ETF Grades by Seeking Alpha. Its 0.04% annual expense ratio is very low, earning the fund an A+ in that category. VO pays just a 1.6% trailing 12-month dividend yield, but that is a bit above the yield of the S&P 500. Share-price momentum remains decent, but has turned less strong compared to earlier in the year.

Being a low-cost and diversified equity ETF, VO has generally favorable risk ratings. Muted volatility across markets lately has helped keep the ETF’s standard deviation in check going back to November 2023. Finally, VO is highly liquid, averaging more than 500,000 shares daily with a 30-day median bid/ask spread of just two basis points, per Vanguard.

Looking closer at the portfolio, the 4-star, Gold-rated ETF by Morningstar plots across the middle of the style box, but Morningstar’s assessment puts the fund partially into the large-cap row. What’s ideal for investors seeking diversification is that there’s about an even split between value and growth whereas the SPX is tilted to growth. The allocation’s P/E is now close to 19, which is not a bargain, but long-term EPS growth is near 10%, resulting in a decent PEG, but by no means a screaming deal.

Last year, I highlighted that mid-caps have quietly outperformed both large- and small-cap stocks throughout history, and I like how VO’s complexion today has a nice mix of growth and value sectors.

With a higher valuation today and underperformance to large-cap growth, VO’s technical chart is generally favorable, but there are indicators to monitor. Notice in the graph below that shares are currently consolidating in a symmetrical triangle with an apex that would be in the low $240s. A rally through the 2024 peak of $248 would be bullish, suggesting an upside measured move price target to near $265 based on the height of the current coil pattern. A breakdown under $240 may lead to a fall into the low $220s, however.

But take a look at where long-term support appears. The $227 to $230 zone was key resistance time and again from Q2 2022 through the middle of last year. Shares also consolidated there before rallying earlier this year. I see that spot as the likely area where the bulls will defend VO. What’s more, the ETF’s long-term 200-day moving average is rising, currently just shy of the $230 mark. While the RSI momentum gauge at the top of the chart has been deteriorating over the past six months, it has not spent much time in technical oversold conditions.

The Southern Company (NYSE:SO) is an electric utility conglomerate that offers power generation assets of many and varied types including nuclear, wind, solar, natural gas, coal, hydro and battery storage facilities. It incorporated in 1945 breaking away from Commonwealth Southern to form in 1949 The Southern Company.

It is the largest US electricity producer and wholesale provider in the Southwest US, with 9 million customers over 7 states.

The main energy divisions and states are mixed to a degree but are divided by the power generation type and services offered.

1 - Electric

The regulated electric operations are named after the states they operate in: Alabama, Georgia and Mississippi Power have 44,000 MW of electric and gas capacity. It includes 27,000 transmission lines, 3700 substations and 300,000 acres of right of way access.

2 - Gas

Regulated natural gas operations cover 4.68 million retail customers in the 4 states of Illinois, Virginia, Tennessee, Georgia under the following 5 company names:

- Southern Co Gas

- Atlanta Gas Light

- Chattanooga Gas

- Nicor Gas in Illinois is its most recent purchase, bought in 2016.

- Virginia Nat Gas.

3 - Other

-Southern Wholesale Energy ""SWE"" markets the retail operating companies' surplus generating capacity to the wholesale market.

It operates 77,900 miles of gas pipelines along with 14 storage facilities.

Vogtle Nuclear Power Plant

Southern Company Vogtle nuclear power GA (SO company website )

Southern Company 4 Unit Nuclear power towers.

Alvin W. Vogtle Electric Generating Plant in Waynesboro, GA provides the largest generation of clean low carbon energy in the US with Unit 3 opening July 31, 2023, becoming the first new nuclear reactor in the United States in 7 years. Unit 4 just entered commercial operation on April 29, 2024. These units will provide power to 1 million homes for 60-80 years as it also had its licenses renewed by the Nuclear Regulatory Commission in 2009 for an additional 20 years to January 16, 2047, for Vogtle Unit 1, and September 2, 2049, for Unit 2; as they were powered up separately. It is the 2nd largest power station in the US and the only one with 4 units.

Units 1&2 are Westinghouse 4 loop pressurized water reactors using General Electric steam and turbine generators, completed in 1987 & 1989. They have twin natural draft cooling towers, both 548 ft. tall for the main condensers with 4 smaller mechanical draft towers to provide nuclear service cooling water for safety and auxiliary non-safety components along with removing decay heat from the reactor when it is offline. Bechtel designed the containment steel lined prestressed post tensioned concrete cylinders with a hemispherical dome that was adopted, with the final cost jumping from $660 million to $8.87B.

Units 3&4 permits were applied for in 2006 and were approved in 2009 by the NRC when preliminary construction began as well. The Towers selected had an increased height to 600 ft.

Westinghouse AP 1000 reactors were chosen in Dec 2011 after 19 revisions to plans.

Certified construction costs were $14 Billion in 2017 and then the cost increases began to rise with the bankruptcy of Westinghouse, which was owned by Toshiba. To make a long story short, costs rose to $25B in 2018, $28.5 B in 2021 and upped to $34B in 2023 with Unit 4 yet to be completed. Bechtel was the finalized contractor for Unit 4 and did finish it in 2024, after a delay of ~2 years.

Management actually had numerous setbacks and government regulation issues that pushed out costs and final opening dates, but overcame it with exceptional resilience and determination to finalize the project. Government loan guarantees and a settlement from Toshiba helped reduce refinancing costs for Georgia Power along the way. It is a major, expensive achievement and should be regarded as a superior quality carbon-free energy source for years to come.

It is important to note Southern Company has set a goal of Zero Carbon in all operations by 2050. Only new environmental legislation and other fossil fuel regulations can put that plan in jeopardy. It is well on its way to success with the newly operational nuclear power plant units and retiring 8 coal plants by 2028.

Kemper Mississippi Plant Project - finished 2017 but not as planned

This was to be a renewable carbon capture project utilizing coal to provide clean energy. It had the potential to be the single most important experiment in developing electricity in the world. It was designed and approved during the Obama administration and became an expensive failure with huge cost overruns of ~$6B. It missed all its targets and goals for ""clean coal"" syngas energy production and has been functional since 2017 as a plant burning natural gas only.

Through it all and the $ billions spent, the company maintains an A- S&P credit rating.

It is important to note there are other companies that own and operate nuclear power plants and are shown in the chart below.

Leading operators of nuclear power plants in the United States as of July 2023, by capacity (in megawatts)

Top 10 Nuclear Power generating companies 2023. (Statista.com)

Constellation Energy (CEG) is #1 and operates Mid-Atlantic, Midwest, New York and Texas/ERCOT, with Duke Energy (DUK) being #2, operating in the Carolinas, Florida and the Midwest US.

Southern Company sits comfortably in the middle of the top 10 providers.

Dividend

Southern Company has 24 years of paying a rising dividend. This raise was 2.9% from 70 to 72c and will be paying $2.88 per year. It has a 3.16% 5-year DGR, making this recent one a bit below average. The normal payout is also close to average at 76.16%.

At the current price of $77.57 it has a yield of 3.7%.

Earnings

FAST Facts on the right side of the graph also lists most of the statistics mentioned below.

Normal (blue line) 7-year P/E is 19.72x, and it is selling at 20.34x, running a bit over value lately.

2024 estimated earnings rise of 10% is much better than the 1% seen in 2023. Estimates for 2025 and 2026 are good, with each predicted to be 7%.

SO 7-year technical chart (FAST Graphs June 30, 2024)

Earnings and cash flows should continue to rise with numerous positive tailwinds for it, including:

- newly operating, long-awaited opening of Unit #3 and #4 nuclear energy plants in GA.

- low utility rates in the southern US and continued good political ties to maintain those.

- growing energy demands and contracts signed with numerous customers over 10 years.

- Rate relief should happen with improved macroeconomic improvements.

Only long-term environmental issues should be the negatives for it and all energy providers.

Chowder#

A measure of investing success is the Chowder# which is obtained by adding the current dividend yield + the 5-year dividend growth rate. At the current price the yield is 3.7%, and it has a 5-year DGR of 3.16% giving it a C# of 6.86, almost 7.

The C# desired for a utility is 8, which means it does not currently pass that metric.

Rose Take & Recommendation

Great quality company, but amazing to think it might now be overvalued if using the normal P/E and C#. A 4.84% minimal yield is needed to pass the C#. This is a company I have enjoyed owning for many years and in the past, I looked for a 5% yield to add to the position, meaning ~$58 currently. The Rose Recommendation is a hold and watch for that lower valuation and higher yield to buy.

Summary/Conclusion

Utilities in general are not in favor, and to find Southern Company up in value was a bit of a surprise. It most likely is for the good reason the nuclear units #3 and this year #4 are in operation and will push more positive earnings for this year in the future. The Rose's Income Garden portfolio of 85 stocks in all sectors is up this year by 7.21% and has a yield of 6.2%. It holds 9 investments in the utility sector, with a CEF holding the top value spot, followed by Duke and then SO. I consider owning utility stocks as defense for the portfolio and recommend getting some for any diversified portfolio.","It incorporated in 1945 breaking away from Commonwealth Southern to form in 1949 The Southern Company.

Arbor Realty Trust, Inc. (NYSE:ABR) is a well-managed real estate investment trust that is focused on mortgage investments, particularly in the multi-family sector.

The trust originates loans and provides servicing for the single-family and multi-family industries, and also owns other commercial real estate assets.

What makes Arbor Realty Trust a compelling yield-driven investment for passive income investors is the trust's $0.43 per share per quarter dividend that has been consistently covered by distributable earnings in the last year and the trust's consistent growth in book value per share.

I think Arbor Realty Trust puts a high quality 12.1% yield offer on the table that passive income investors will find hard to resist.

My Rating History

My last stock classification on Arbor Realty Trust was Strong Buy because I thought the mortgage real estate investment trust's multi-family investments made the trust a unique investment vehicle in the mortgage market.

Arbor Realty Trust has avoided dividend cuts in its recent history, which is something that can't be said for every mortgage trust. I think the 12% yield is reasonably safe and the trust's excess coverage provides an additional buffer for the dividend.

Portfolio Breakdown

Arbor Realty Trust's business is made up of two parts. The main part, the Structured Business, consists of investments in the multi-family, single-family rental and commercial real estate markets. Mostly these are multi-family loans of various kinds (bridge loans, mezzanine loans), but the trust also invests in other mortgage-related securities.

The Agency Business, the second pillar of Arbor Realty Trust's investments, deals with the selling and servicing of multi-family loan products through, for instance, government-sponsored enterprises Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac. Multi-family assets made up the majority of the trust's structured portfolio (87%) and balance sheet as of March 31, 2024.

Portfolio Breakdown (Arbor Realty Trust)

The Structured Business held a whopping 90% of assets as of March 31, 2024, or a total of $13.2 billion. In total, the mortgage trust owned $15.1 billion in assets, reflecting a decline of 4% QoQ due to loan sales.

Asset And Liabilities Overview (Arbor Realty Trust)

Arbor Realty Trust's assets produce a steady stream of income for the mortgage trust: In 1Q24, the mortgage real estate investment company produced $103.6 million in net interest income, the trust's key source of income that gets passed through to shareholders, reflecting a 5% decline YoY, primarily due to loan sales.

What matters most for a mortgage trust like Arbor Realty Trust is to earn its dividend with distributable earnings, which the trust has had no problems with.

Revenues (Arbor Realty Trust)

Well-Covered 12% Yield

Arbor Realty Trust out-earned its dividend with distributable earnings in the first quarter as well as in the last year. The trust's portfolio assets produced $0.47 per share in distributable earnings in the first quarter, which equated to a dividend payout ratio of 91.5%.

Accounting for a $1.6 million realized loss on a non-performing loan, Arbor Realty Trust had adjusted distributable earnings of $0.48 per share and a dividend payout ratio of 89.6%.

In the last twelve months, Arbor Realty Trust paid out only 81.90% of its distributable earnings, non-adjusted, which implies that the mortgage trust offers passive income investors a very well-covered 12% yield.

The largest mortgage real estate investment trust in the industry, Annaly Capital Management, Inc. (NLY) paid out 90.6% of its distributable earnings, so Arbor Realty Trust is going better than the industry's heavyweight as far as the margin of safety is concerned.

Distributable Earnings (Author Created Table Using Trust Information)

Book Value Growth And Multiple

Arbor Realty is making a differentiated value proposition for passive income investors through its ability to grow its book value even in difficult markets.

The mortgage real estate investment trust has been able to grow both its book value and dividend since 1Q19 and has outperformed its mortgage trust peers by a considerable degree.

Arbor Realty had a GAAP book value of $13.02 as of March 31, 2024 (my intrinsic value estimate) which was 36% higher than in 1Q19.

Book Value Per Share (Arbor Realty Trust)

Passive income investors are presently paying a 9% premium for the opportunity to invest in Arbor Realty Trust's business. Other mortgage real estate investment trusts with large agency investment approaches, like Annaly Capital Management and AGNC Investment Corp. (AGNC) are selling for book value multiples of 1.0x.

Since both Annaly and AGNC own large portfolio of mortgage-backed securities, which are interest rate-sensitive, their stocks have suffered selling and valuation pressure after the central bank said in June that it would now only consider one cut to short-term interest rates as opposed to up to three cuts previously.

The fact that Arbor Realty Trust is selling for a higher premium to book value is attributable to the trust's lesser focus on interest rate-sensitive mortgage-backed securities, a robust dividend payout ratio, as well as its ability to grow its book value per share over time.

Data by YCharts

Why An Investment In Arbor Realty Trust Might Underperform

Arbor Realty Trust is concentrated in multi-family assets and therefore could suffer a hard blow if the multi-family sector were to get hit by either higher interest rates or a wave of loan problems. If more borrowers default on their multi-family payments, Arbor Realty Trust would likely take a serious hit to its earnings and book value.

Higher interest rates or a correction in the U.S. real estate market could be a catalyst for such as scenario to emerge.

My Conclusion

Three things stand out with Arbor Realty Trust:

The mortgage real estate investment trust is focused on multi-family investments, which separates it from other mortgage trusts that are overly invested in Agency MBS; Arbor Realty Trust's dividend is well-covered by distributable earnings, and has been so consistently in the last twelve months; The trust has avoided the troubles of other mortgage trusts that are more heavily geared towards Agency mortgage-backed securities and has thus succeeded in growing its book value per share, leading to a higher book value multiple.

In my view, passive income investors have an opportunity here to collect a solid 12.1% yield from a differentiated mortgage trust.

I think that the trust's performance track record, particularly as far as book value growth is concerned, is a strong reason to overweight ABR. I have made Arbor Realty Trust a core holding in my passive income portfolio with a 3% weight.","I think Arbor Realty Trust puts a high quality 12.1% yield offer on the table that passive income investors will find hard to resist.

Morningstar's Best Value Stocks

On June 26, Morningstar published 10 Best Value Stocks to Buy for the Long Term 10 Best Value Stocks to Buy for the Long Term.

Morningstar noted:

Best Value Stocks Criteria (Morningstar)

Morningstar's 10 Best Value Stocks to Buy are listed below.

Morningstar

Morningstar gives a fair value estimate for each of the stocks. They have a price to fair value ranging from 53% to 85%. A list of the ratio of the stock's price on June 28 compared to Morningstar's fair value estimate, Morningstar Uncertainty Rating, Morningstar Capital Allocation rating and Industry is shown below. One of the 10 Best Value Stocks - Comcast (CMCSA) also appeared in Morningstar's 10 Best Dividend Stocks article published on May 6. It had the highest potential rate of return among those 10 dividend stocks per the analysis I performed and published on May 27 Going Beyond Morningstar's 10 Best Dividend Stocks List.

Attributes of Morningstar's 10 Best Value Stocks (Morningstar)

Valuation and Estimated Potential Total Return Analysis Approach

Morningstar did not discuss price earnings ratio, earnings growth rate, dividend growth rates, nor potential total future returns in their article. Their fair value estimated comes from a discounted cash flow analysis. In my opinion, selecting a stock based on discounted cash flow without considering other valuation metrics such as price multiple or potential total return is a job half done. I performed a valuation analysis of each of the stocks, then estimated their potential future total rate of return. I used FAST Graphs to estimate earnings growth from now through the end of 2026. I then computed each stock's PEG ratio using Peter Lynch's favorite metric - PE divided by earnings growth rate + dividend yield. That metric is particularly useful for dividend stocks such as these, which tend to have above-average dividend yields but below-average earnings growth rates. I then used FAST Graphs to estimate the potential total rate of return of each stock.

S&P 500 Valuation and Potential Total Return

I first performed a valuation analysis of the S&P 500 (SPY) and estimated its potential future return. I did this to compare the potential total return of Morningstar's 10 Best Value Stocks to investing in the S&P 500 instead. The analysis, summarized below, illustrates the analysis performed on each of the Morningstar 10 Best Value Stocks.

FAST Graphs calculates that the current blended PE of the S&P 500 is 24.3. Earnings are expected to grow at an annual rate of 13.06% from now through the end of 2026. SPY has a 1.26% dividend yield. The S&P 500's PEG Ratio - PE/ (EG + DY) - is 1.69. Somewhat above what Peter Lynch deemed optimum (less than 1).

The 20-year price performance of the S&P 500 is shown below. Adjusted (Operating) earnings per share (EPS), EPS change, and dividends are listed at the bottom for each year. The black line is the historic stock price. The average annual earnings growth rate, from 2003 through 2026 is 7.84%. The average price multiple that the market has placed on the S&P 500's earnings over the last 20 years has been 19 and the blue line shown is 19 times earnings. Over the last 20 years, the price of the S&P 500 has oscillated above and below its 20-year average of 19 times earnings. It currently sits considerably above its 20-year average, signifying that the S&P 500 is historically overvalued. The blue line shows the price of the S&P 500 if its PE ratio was its 20-year average of 19 and earnings grow as estimated.

S&P 500 20-Year Stock Performance (FASTGraphs)

As shown below, if the S&P 500's PE reverts to its 20-Year average, and it achieves its estimated earnings, its price would grow at an annual rate of 2.5%. Add its estimated dividends, and the annual rate of return of the S&P 500 if it reverted back to its 20-year average PE ratio by the end of 2026 would be 4.1%.

Rate of Return if the S&P 500 reverts back to its 20-year average PE (FASTGraphs)

Over the last 5 fiscal years, the S&P 500's earnings have grown faster, and its price multiple has been higher, than its 20-year-long term average. The five-year look below shows that the S&P 500's average annual earnings growth rate has been 8.85% and its average PE 21.18 compared to the 20-year 7.84% and 19 respectively. It is still overvalued compared to its recent 5-year average price multiple but less so. If the S&P 500 reverts to its 5-year average price multiple by the end of 2026, it would give an average annual rate of return of 8.5%.

Rate of Return if the S&P 500 reverts back to its 5-year average PE (FASTGraphs)

Finally, if the PE ratio of the S&P 500 did not change but remained at its current 24.3 price multiple, its rate of return would be its earnings growth rate plus dividend yield. That would give a (13.06 + 1.26) = 14.3% annual rate of return.

I averaged each of the three rates of return - S&P 500 reverting back to its 20-year-long term price multiple, reverting back to its 5-year recent price multiple, or keeping its current multiple to produce a blended potential rate of return through the end of 2026. That gives an estimate of 9.0% annual rate of return through the end of 2026 for the currently overvalued S&P 500. This approach to estimating future returns uses all the information available - current price multiple, historic price multiple, best estimates of future earnings and dividends and I believe is an excellent approach to estimate potential future returns to compare different stocks as potential investments.

I used this approach to estimate Morningstar's 10 Best Dividend Stocks future total return.

Valuation and Potential Total Return of Morningstar's 10 Best Value Stocks to Buy for the Long Term

Polaris

The first stock listed by Morningstar is Polaris (PII)

FAST Graphs calculates that the current blended PE of Polaris is 9.15. FAST Graphs estimates earnings will grow at an annual rate of 9.55% from now through the end of 2026. Polaris has a 3.37% dividend yield. Polaris's PEG Ratio - PE/ (EG + DY) - is 0.71. Quite a bit lower than the S&P 500.

The 20-year performance of Polaris stock is shown below. The average annual earnings growth rate, from 2003 through the 2026 estimate, is 9.52%. Higher than the S&P 500's and about the same as its current estimated earnings growth rate. The average price that the market has placed on Polaris earnings over that time period was 16.47 times earnings, and the blue line shown is 16.47 times earnings. The price of Polaris has oscillated above and below its 20-year average of 16.47 times earnings and now sits considerably below its 20-year average price multiple signifying that Polaris is undervalued. Earnings are expected to grow again after 2024. The blue line shows the price of Polaris if its PE ratio was its 20-year average and earnings grown as expected.

Polaris 20-Year Stock Performance (FASTGraphs)

As shown below, if Polaris's price reverts to its 20-year normal PE, and it achieves its estimated earnings, its price would grow at an annual rate of 38.5%. Add its estimated dividends, and the potential annual rate of return if Polaris reverts to its 20-year normal PE ratio would be over 40%.

Rate of Return if Polaris reverts back to its 20-year average PE (FASTGraphs)

Polaris's stock performance over the last 5 fiscal years is shown below. Polaris's 6.38% average annual earnings growth rate over the last five years through 2026 estimates and 11.60 average price multiple is lower than the 20-year 9.52% and 16.47 respectively. Polaris' price fell when earnings fell after peaking in 2022. That said, its earnings are expected to begin growing again after 2024. Earnings expected to grow from now to the end of 2026 at about the same rate as over the last 20 years. If Polaris reverts to its 5-year average price multiple, it will return 23% annually from now through the end of 2026.

Finally, if the PE ratio of Polaris did not change but remained at its current undervalued 9.15 price multiple, its rate of return would be its earnings growth rate plus dividend yield. That would give a (9.55+ 3.37) = 12.9% annual rate of return.

Averaging the rates of each of the three rates of return gives a 25.5% estimated annual rate of return through the end of 2026 for the currently undervalued Polaris.

Bristol-Myers

Bristol-Myers (BMY) has the highest potential rate of return of all of Morningstar's 10 Best Value Stocks.

FAST Graphs calculates Bristol-Myers current Blended PE is 10.15. That PE is a little bit misleading as it reflects current blended earnings, which FAST Graphs calculates as about midway between decent trailing 2023 and terrible forward 2024 earnings. PE based on trailing 2023 earnings is much lower at 5.5. Bristol-Myers earnings are expected to grow at an annual rate of 18.92% from now through the end of 2026. Bristol has a 5.78% dividend yield. Bristol's PEG Ratio - PE/ (EG + DY) - is 0.41. It would certainly meet Peter Lynch's desire for stocks with PEG's below 1.0.

Shown below is Bristol-Myers stock's 20-year performance. Its 5.66% 20-year average annual earnings growth rate is about 25% lower than the S&P 500's. The average price multiple that the market has placed on Bristol-Myers's earnings has been 16.73 and the blue line shown would be the stock price at 16.73 times earnings.

Bristol-Myers 20-year Stock Performance (FASTGraphs)

Bristol-Myers PE has ranged from being severely overvalued, over 30, during a period of exuberance in 2016 to being severely undervalued with PEs under 7 recently. Bristol-Myers earnings peaked in 2022 and have softened since then. Bristol-Myers stock is down 19% year to date. A contributor to its stock price drop has been the collapse of estimated 2024 earnings. The drop in earnings was due to Acquire In-Process Research and Development (IPR&D) as noted below in Bristol-Myers revised 2024 Guidance released with its 1st quarter earnings. Acquired means it was the result of recent company acquisitions it made. IPR&D is expensed to income. 2024 earnings without the Acquired IRP&D would have been between 7.13 to 7.43. The acquired R&D lays the foundation for future income growth.

Bristol-Myers 2024 Guidance (Bristol-Myers)

Neither company Cash Flow nor Free Cash Flow were affected by the IPR&D. Free Cash Flow history is shown below.

Bristol-Myers 20-Year Free Cash Flow Performance (FASTGraphs)

Bristol-Myers current price sits significantly below its 20-year multiple from either Earnings, Cash Flow or Free Cash Flow perspectives, signifying that BMY is significantly undervalued. Earnings are expected to grow after 2024. The blue line on the chart below shows the price of the Bristol-Myers if its price multiple reverts to its normal 20-year average PE while its earnings grow as estimated.

If Bristol-Myers' price to earnings reverts back to its 20-Year average, and it achieves its estimated earnings, its total return, price growth + dividend, would be over 48% annually.

Rate of Return if Bristol-Myers reverts back to its 20-year average PE (FASTGraphs)

Bristol-Myers stock performance of the last 5 fiscal years is shown below. Bristol-Myers recent price appears to be closely following recent earnings and 5-year average PE.

BMY's 5.95% average annual earnings growth rate from 2018 through 2026 estimates is about the same as its 5.66% 20-Year growth rate. But its 10.08 average price multiple is considerably lower than its 20-year 16.73 price multiple. Earnings are expected to begin growing again after 2024.

Bristol-Myers 5-year stock performance (FASTGraphs)

If Bristol-Myers reverts to its 5-year average price multiple and earnings estimates are achieved, it will give an average annual rate of return of 23.2%.

Rate of Return if Bristol-Myers reverts back to its 5-year average PE (FASTGraphs)

If the PE ratio of BMY did not change but remained at its current 10.15 price multiple, its rate of return would be its earnings growth rate plus dividend yield. That would give (18.92 + 5.78) = 24.7% rate of return.

Averaging the rates of each of the three rates of return gives an estimate of a 32.1% annual rate of return through the end of 2026 for the currently undervalued Bristol-Myers.

Bristol-Myers is also undervalued from both Cash Flow and Free Cash Flow perspectives. Bristol-Myers 20-year normal Price to Cash Flow is 16.94. The stock currently has a significantly lower 6.07 prices to cash flow. Its 20-year normal Price to Free Cash Flow is 22.47. The stock currently has a price to free cash flow of 6.36. Estimated future returns from now through 2026 were similar for all three metrics.

Summary of Valuation and Estimated Return of Morningstar's 10 Best Dividend Stocks

I performed the above analysis for each of the remaining Morningstar dividend stocks. The table below summarizes the key data, valuation, and estimated return of each stock. The stocks are ordered by estimated return, from the highest Bristol-Myers to the lowest Campbell Soup (CPB). Companies in blue carry Morningstar's Exemplary Capital Allocation ratings.

Valuation and Estimate Rate of Returns of Morningstar's 10 Best Value Stocks to Buy for the Long Term (Morningstar, FASTGraphs, Author)

Polaris currently has the lowest ratio of price compared to Morningstar's estimate of fair value. UPS has the highest. The next valuation measure - current PE divided by 20-year average PE; British Tobacco has the lowest valuation 50% of its 20-year average PE while Pfizer has the highest with its current PE being 13% higher than its 20-year average PE signifying that British Tobacco is significantly undervalued while Pfizer is fairly valued.

The third valuation measure PE / (EG + DY) shows BMY and BTI are the most undervalued and Campbell Soup the most overvalued. Finally, Average Estimated Rate of Return (ROR) is the average of the rates of return of each stock if the price multiple returns to its 20-year, 5-year, or keeps its current PE. Bristol-Myers has the highest estimated rate of return, while Campbell Soup has the lowest.

The chart below compares the estimated rates of return to current price divided by Morningstar's fair value estimate. Morningstar estimates that the general stock market is overvalued by 2% which I used as an estimate for the S&P 500 (SPY) current price to fair value ratio.

Estimated Rate of Return versus Stock Price to Fair Value Ratio For Morningstar's 10 Best Value Stocks (Morningstar, FASTGraphs, Author)

Morningstar uses a discounted cash flow approach to estimate fair value. That approach is fraught with issues such as estimating a company's cash flow many years into the future and deciding a suitable discount rate, with the resulting fair value sensitive to errors in those assumptions. Plus, most individual investors do not run discount cash flow analysis before investing. That said, the estimated rate of returns calculated and the stock price to Morningstar's Fair Value generally agree on which stocks are better investments today.

Estimated rate of return versus the PEG valuation metric is shown below. PEG is a useful valuation metric, but it treats all stocks equally. It does not consider what the market has actually paid for a dollar of earnings for different companies. That said, the estimated rates of return and PEG ratios correlate very well.

The chart below compares the dividend yield of Morningstar's 10 Best Value Stocks to Buy and their estimated annual rate of return through 2026. I like using this chart to compare dividend stocks. As a retired investor, I am interested not only in high dividend yields but also total return. The blue line below is my ""goodness line"". I am willing to buy a stock with zero dividend yield if it has an estimated return about twice the S&P 500's. I will trade total return for higher dividend yield. I would be willing to buy a stock with a 10% dividend yield, but only has a 10% estimated rate of return. This is the bird in hand worth two in the bush scenario, trading off potential total return for the higher probability dividend return. Also, a stock which gives a 10% dividend with 10% total return would, by definition, have zero price appreciation. That return would be analogous to a bond but with about twice the yield of current government bonds.

Dividend Yield versus Estimated Returns for Morningstar's 10 Best Value Stocks (FASTGraphs, Author)

Stocks to the right of the line are better investments, have higher estimated returns for the same dividend yield, than stocks to the left of the line. The further to the right, the better the potential investment. BTI, BMY, CMCSA, PII, USB, UPS appear to be superior investments than GILD, TD, PFE, CPB and the S&P 500. They are blue-chip companies with wide economic moats, standard to exemplary capital allocation ratings, and have much higher dividend yields and potentially higher total returns than the S&P 500. Those are the best Morningstar 10 Best Value Stocks to Buy for the Long Term.

Risks to Investors

There are three principal risks to investors. The first is that the companies do not achieve their estimated earnings per share. The five best companies are blue-chip companies with multiple analysts following each of them and with fairly well predicted earnings. FAST Graphs provides an analyst scorecard, and these companies tend to meet their earnings estimates. British Tobacco, for example, met its two years out earnings estimate 92% of the time. Bristol-Myers met its two-year earnings estimates 75% of the time and beat it 25% of the time. Altria (MO) met its two-year out earnings estimates 100% of the time. Pfizer (PFE) had the worst record, beating estimates 17%, meeting 67%, and missing 17% of the time.

The second risk is that these undervalued stocks continue to remain undervalued and do not revert back to their longer-term price multiples over the next 2 1/2 years. If this happens and the PEs of five stocks noted above do not change, their price would still appreciate at their earnings growth rate while an investor would collect a nice dividend yield being paid to wait for them to revert to fairly valued. For the case of the Best Balanced 5, earnings would appreciate 13% a year. Add in the 6.5% dividend yield and an investor could earn a 19.5% annual return waiting for price multiples to revert back to long-term mean.

Finally, the third risk is the risk of an economic downturn. That said, value investing does just fine in recessions.","RichVintageMorningstar's Best Value StocksOn June 26, Morningstar published 10 Best Value Stocks to Buy for the Long Term 10 Best Value Stocks to Buy for the Long Term.

One of the biggest beneficiaries to the AI rally this year is a company most investors have hardly heard of: SoundHound AI (NASDAQ:SOUN), a company best recognized for using AI and automation technology to power restaurant drive-throughs. Secular tailwinds and a surge of interest in AI have driven a massive bona fide growth spurt for this company, which is now nearly doubling its revenue growth y/y. It's capitalizing on this surge of interest as well to expand, acquiring rival SYNQ3 for an undisclosed sum.

Amid this fundamental moment, shares of SoundHound have surged nearly 90% year to date. As is always the case when stocks shoot up this far so quickly, it's a great time to take a step back and assess whether it's worth holding on for this rally.

Data by YCharts

At its new bloated valuation, SoundHound is a mixed bag

I last wrote a bullish article on SoundHound in November, when the stock was still trading well under $2 per share. I've enjoyed massive gains on my position since then, but owing to the sharpness of this year's rally (even after fizzling out from even stronger gains seen since March), I've decided to de-risk my position and exit SoundHound. I'm now downgrading the stock to a neutral rating.

While I acknowledge the strength of SoundHound's results (we'll cover its Q1 update in more detail in the next section), I can no longer justify SoundHound's valuation in the context of its longer term potential. To be sure, I still see a number of positive factors in the stock's favor:

Rapid and accelerating growth. Though admittedly small at a <$100 million annualized revenue scale, SoundHound is growing revenue at a rapid >70% y/y pace, which is a signal of strong execution and a largely greenfield market for its technology.

Though admittedly small at a <$100 million annualized revenue scale, SoundHound is growing revenue at a rapid >70% y/y pace, which is a signal of strong execution and a largely greenfield market for its technology. Blue-chip customers. Though small, SoundHound has already amassed a nice and growing roster of premier customers, ranging from Oracle (ORCL), Toast, Square (SQ), Hyundai, and Jeep. A new partnership with Olo (which we'll discuss in this article) also gives SoundHound the capacity to expand to many more restaurants.

A new partnership with Olo (which we'll discuss in this article) also gives SoundHound the capacity to expand to many more restaurants. Secular tailwinds toward automation. Especially as wage labor costs rise in the service industries, more and more companies will be interested in deploying technology to bring down labor and increase margins as much as possible.

But at the same time, there are risks that have emerged that we must keep in mind:

SoundHound is niche, and its specific verticals may be subject to sharp cyclicality. The majority of SoundHound's business rests on quick-service restaurants, and particularly drive-throughs. We first have to ask whether drive-throughs, in the age of on-demand delivery, will run at the same volumes as in the past. SoundHound has additional exposure to the car manufacturing space, also volatile amid economic downturns.

We first have to ask whether drive-throughs, in the age of on-demand delivery, will run at the same volumes as in the past. SoundHound has additional exposure to the car manufacturing space, also volatile amid economic downturns. Weak gross margins. SoundHound's sub-70% pro forma gross margins lag behind many of its software peers (an argument for the company to trade at a discount vis-a-vis similarly growing peers), and it's nowhere near hitting break-even on adjusted EBITDA or pro forma operating income.

Above all, SoundHound's rally has rendered the stock quite expensive - though we do have to give the stock some credit for a deserved premium owing to its recent growth spurt (the question is if that growth can be sustained).

At current share prices just under $4, SoundHound trades at a market cap of $1.29 billion. After we net off the $211.7 million of cash and $85.5 million of debt off SoundHound's most recent balance sheet, the company's resulting enterprise value is $1.16 billion.

Meanwhile, for the current fiscal year, SoundHound has guided to a relatively wide revenue range of $65-$77 million, which represents 42-68% y/y growth (which to me indicates quite low visibility for this company, whereas many software peers guide to a much tighter range).

SoundHound outlook (SoundHound Q1 earnings release)

Meanwhile, for next year FY25, Wall Street consensus is calling for $103.5 million in revenue, or 46% growth versus the midpoint of FY24's range: which we can consider quite aggressive if we consider the fact that the SYNQ3 acquisition will be fully comped after Q1 and that this year represented a significant growth spurt that may be difficult to grow another >40% on top of.

Nevertheless, taking guidance and consensus at face value, we arrive at valuation multiples of:

16.3x EV/FY24 revenue

11.2x EV/FY25 revenue

Owing to my concerns on SoundHound's ability to execute at a larger scale, I'm not keen on paying a double-digit revenue multiple on a company that has only recently accelerated growth beyond the ~20% range. I'd take advantage of this year's rally to lock in any gains and move to the sidelines until the company provides better clarity on its growth trajectory.

Q1 download

SoundHound shocked and awed the markets with its tremendous growth this year. In Q1, as shown in the chart below, revenue grew 73% y/y to $11.6 million, substantially outperforming Wall Street's $10.1 million (+51% y/y) expectations.

SoundHound Q1 results (SoundHound Q1 earnings release)

The company has noted a few key restaurant vertical wins as one of the core drivers of outperformance. The company has signed new agreements and pilots with Church's Chicken (a Georgia-based chicken chain with over 1,000 locations) and Jersey Mike's, while one of its long-time customers, White Castle, has expanded its usage; alongside Applebee's.

The core thing we like to see, however, is SoundHound's expansion beyond restaurant voice AI. SoundHound refers to these use cases such as automated voice call assistants as its ""pillar two"", and it did note some significant wins in Q1, with over 100,000 locations in its pipeline compared to 10,000 in the existing base. Per CEO Keyvan Mohajer's remarks on the Q1 earnings call:

This quarter was a special quarter for our pillar two, where we offer AI customer service solutions for businesses. About 30% of our revenue was from pillar two with over 10,000 locations laid in production and over 100,000 in our pipeline. Just a year ago, these numbers were negligible [...] Last year, we expanded our AI customer service offering beyond restaurants with Smart Answering, a product that handles multiple calls at once 24/7, conveniently filtering out spam calls, providing verbal and SMS responses, taking configurable actions, capturing leads with intelligent messaging and answering questions about policies, hours, products, services, pricing and more. Smart Answering is showing rapid growth within pillar two and already has hundreds of locations signed up from single-location small businesses to brands such as Planet Fitness. We estimate our pillar two total addressable market to be over $100 billion with over 1 million restaurants and approximately 30 million businesses in North America alone that we can offer our solutions to. And with dozens of languages we already provide to our pillar one customers, we plan to also go international in pillar two. We believe with large language models and generative AI and most importantly, the data science and machine learning behind our proprietary software, the time is now.""

The expansion of this segment to 30% of revenue is what keeps me positive on SoundHound's prospects. We note as well that the company reported cumulative subscription and bookings backlog growing 80% y/y to $682 million, with an average duration of 7 years: which gives us some confidence in the company's ability to build its revenue base with long-term contracts that have potential for customer expansion.

We should keep in mind, however, some red flags on profitability in the Q1 earnings print. In particular, pro forma gross margins fell 680bps y/y to 65.5% (which as I pointed out earlier lags behind most software companies in the mid-70s). The company attributed the gross margin weakness to the inclusion of SYNQ3's results as well as poorer margins from a higher ""pillar two"" / contact center business revenue mix. The company is hoping for margin improvement back to pre-acquisition levels throughout this year as this business scales.

Adjusted EBITDA losses also widened slightly, 3% higher y/y at -$15.4 million, or a -132% adjusted EBITDA margin. This is something we should keep a close eye on, as SoundHound is nowhere near profitability.

Key takeaways

In my view, SoundHound has become a classic tech investment in the late cycles of a market rally: hypergrowth at all costs, big losses, and a big valuation. As my priority is to de-risk my portfolio in anticipation of a near-term correction, I'd prefer to move to the sidelines here until SoundHound returns to a better, safer price.","Secular tailwinds and a surge of interest in AI have driven a massive bona fide growth spurt for this company, which is now nearly doubling its revenue growth y/y.

Realty Income Corporation (NYSE:O), incorporated in 1969 and headquartered in San Diego, CA, owns and net-leases properties mainly to retailers.

I believe that this REIT is worthy of consideration for both income and value portfolios. Its portfolio diversification level and the nature of the leases can provide stable returns over the long term. But more importantly, the shares appear to be undervalued and now the dividend yield is quite attractive considering the track record and coverage. A shift in market perception driven by lower interest rates could also allow investors to realize unusually high total returns in the near term.

Dividend & Capital Growth

O currently pays a monthly dividend of $0.26 per share, resulting in a forward yield of 5.9%. With a payout ratio of 75.72% based on the last quarterly AFFO annualized and the past payment record, it's reasonable to assume that the yield is attractive and sustainable.

Seeking Alpha

The company also has a long history of delivering value to shareholders through its expansion, as reflected in the long-term growth of its stock price, making it a very good income vehicle:

Data by YCharts

As a result, O has greatly outperformed the real estate market and is only a bit behind the overall equity market as it recently became cheaper and the latter became expensive:

Data by YCharts

The yield is high enough to make this well-established REIT attractive but, first, let's take a look at the portfolio.

Portfolio and Leases

The REIT's portfolio consists of 15,485 properties that aggregate 334,223,900 square feet and are spread all over the U.S., with also exposure to Europe, Alaska, Hawaii, and Puerto Rico. The portfolio is also diversified on a property-type basis. As of the last quarterly report, 79.6% of the portfolio consists of retail properties and 14.7% was industrial, with the rest accommodating gaming, agriculture, office, and country clubs.

I also appreciate that 24.6% of rent comes from grocery stores, convenience stores, and drug stores, which can prove to be resilient revenue sources in adverse periods, providing stability for Realty Income. Additionally, the largest 20 tenants who are responsible for 36.3% of ABR, include large corporations like Dollar General, Walgreens, Dollar Tree, 7-Eleven, and FedEx, with the largest one being Dollar General which accounts for only 3.4% of ABR. The tenant base is clearly as well-diversified as the portfolio. Moreover, at the end of the first quarter, occupancy was very high at 98.6%.

Realty Income net-leases the overwhelming majority of the portfolio, which makes for long-term income generation and low costs; as of the end of the first quarter, the WALT was about 9.8 years and the weighted average rent escalation rate was ~2%. This is the other part of the appeal in O, the first being the attractive dividend frequency and payment record. The reliance on this REIT for monthly income is backed by a timeless need for the services that its tenants provide, as well as lease structures that make for predictability in that income. This reliance is anything but speculative.

Performance & Leverage

Because of the recent merger with Spirit Realty, the YoY rental revenue growth based on the last quarterly results was very high since the addition of Spirit's revenue to consolidated results during the quarter was responsible for ~55% of the change. Same-property rental revenue increased by 0.76% on a YoY basis which is natural for a net-lease REIT.

Last Quarter YoY Change Total Rental Revenue $1.2B 30.57% Same-Store Rental Revenue $843.4MM 0.76% AFFO/Share $1.03 5.1% Click to enlarge

AFFO per share increased by 5.1% YoY and this is higher than the management's currently projected growth rate of 4%, the latter indicating slower growth but nevertheless attractive. This, coupled with the high dividend yield, provides even more proof of the sustainability of the dividend and the prospects for dividend growth.

Now, with credit ratings of A3 and A- by Moody's and S&P, respectively, the REIT's cost of debt is very low. That's not surprising given its low leverage, strong liquidity, and very good interest coverage. The majority of its debt is also unsecured, providing them with great flexibility.

Also, the maturities are well-scheduled and low amounts are coming due in the next two years:

Investor Presentation

All in all, I think that the long-term outlook is good and the REIT will be able to keep taking advantage of attractive opportunities to expand the business in the short term.

Valuation

Rising interest rates have been hard for REIT stock prices and O is no different; today, the dividend yield of 5.9% represents good value, considering that its 4-year average yield is 4.71% and that the sector median is even lower at 4.32%. Moreover, SPG, KIM, and REG currently offer lower yields and average an FFO multiple of 13x which is higher than Realty Income's 12.53x:

Stock P/FFO O 12.53 SPG 11.97 KIM 12.21 REG 14.86 Average 13 Click to enlarge

Considering the growth prospects of the business and dividend, the AFFO yield of 7.8% appears attractive. In fact, in the last earnings call the CEO stated that they expect a ~10% return based on the yield and the AFFO growth. However, if interest rates start decreasing, the short-term returns may be even greater than that as market perception becomes more aligned with Realty Income's fundamentals.

Risks

Because of the diversification level of this REIT's business and the good stock price, there are no significant risks for those who are looking for a long-term income vehicle that is going to more than preserve their capital.

However, interest rates may stay high for too long and since there are more undervalued REITs out there that offer higher but sustainable yields, this represents an opportunity risk in the shorter term for those who are looking for more than a sustainable income stream.

And though there is no overreliance on any single tenant here, if something were to adversely affect retailers in general, the additional risk perceived by the market could drive the price lower. Shareholders who intend to buy and hold should monitor the market to better interpret the price changes of O and prevent themselves from making hasty decisions.

Verdict

It's fairly obvious that the prospects greatly outweigh the risks for Realty Income. As a result of the low valuation, investors could realize double-digit returns based on AFFO expectations, a high yield, and the prospect of lower interest rates. For these reasons, I am rating O stock a buy.

July 1st was definitely an interesting day for shareholders of both The Boeing Company (NYSE:BA) and Spirit AeroSystems Holdings (NYSE:SPR). Shares of both businesses moved a bit higher after both companies announced that Boeing will be acquiring Spirit AeroSystems in an all-stock transaction valued at $4.7 billion on an equity value basis and at about $8.3 billion on an enterprise value basis. This is an intriguing transaction that's different than most deals that most companies make. Usually, the goal here is to significantly expand the revenue base of the acquirer. But this is an odd transaction because the vast majority of the revenue currently generated by Spirit AeroSystems comes from its suitor.

Looking into the deal, I can understand why Boeing would want to make this maneuver. This is almost certainly an attempt to capture significant cost savings down the road. However, there does not appear to be much evidence that this will be successful. And when you look at the transaction from a revenue growth perspective, the situation doesn't look much better. At the end of the day, this deal does not change my overall neutral assessment of Boeing. But I do think this should be viewed favorably by investors of Spirit AeroSystems.

An interesting purchase

According to the press release issued by Boeing on July 1st, the company has agreed to acquire Spirit AeroSystems in exchange for $37.25 per share. This represents a premium of 13.3% compared to the $32.87 that the stock was trading at immediately prior to the announcement. Far more impressive is the fact that this represents a premium of 154.3% compared to the 52 week low mark that Spirit AeroSystems has traded at. This transaction initially translates to an equity value of $4.7 billion and to an enterprise value of $8.3 billion.

Author - SEC EDGAR Data

It is important to note, however, that the structure of this transaction means that the ultimate value that flows to shareholders of Spirit AeroSystems most likely will change between now and the time that the deal is expected to close in the middle of 2025. This is because it's an all-stock transaction. But it's not being done at a simple exchange ratio. The lower that shares of Boeing fall, the higher the exchange ratio that Spirit AeroSystems’ investors will receive. And the higher that shares of Boeing go, the lower the exchange ratio will end up being.

In the best-case scenario, where shares of Boeing trade at or below $149 per share, investors in Spirit AeroSystems will end up receiving 0.25 shares of Boeing for each share of Spirit AeroSystems that they currently own. And in the worst-case scenario, at or above a price of $206.94, the exchange ratio will be set at 0.18. At any point in between $149 per share and $206.94, the exchange ratio will be adjusted so that Spirit AeroSystems’ investors will receive exactly $37.25 per share in value.

This structure has certain advantages and disadvantages to it. One of the advantages is that, within the aforementioned range, it locks in the amount of value that shareholders of Spirit AeroSystems will be entitled to. Another advantage is that a slight weakening in the share price of Boeing will lead to a larger share of the conglomerate that Spirit AeroSystems’ investors will end up with. The obvious downside is that, the stronger that Boeing is between now and the time of closing, the smaller piece of the pie that investors of Spirit AeroSystems end up with. And if we see a decline in the price of Boeing below $149 per share, then the effective premium that investors in Spirit AeroSystems will receive shrinks or may even vanish entirely. In the first table of this article, you can see how all of this works out under different pricing regimes. The cells that are highlighted blue indicate the upper and lower ends of the range in question. And the cells highlighted green indicates where shares of Boeing are currently trading.

One other thing that I would like to highlight is that there are termination fees involved in this agreement. If the management team at Spirit AeroSystems decides to back out, for instance, that company will have to pay Boeing $150 million. In the event that Boeing backs out or is unable to achieve regulatory approval, it instead must pay Spirit AeroSystems the sum of $300 million. Neither of these are amounts that will make or break the businesses in question, especially Boeing. But it is some good information to have.

A look at the transaction

In some respects, the transaction that is now agreed upon makes sense for Boeing. And in other respects, it really doesn't. To understand why this is, we should first touch on what Spirit AeroSystems does and how its financial condition appears. Operationally speaking, the company has three different segments. The largest of these, accounting for 81% of revenue last year, is its Commercial segment. Next in line, we have the Defense & Space segment. It accounts for 13% of overall sales. And lastly, we have the Aftermarket segment, which is responsible for about 6% of revenue.

Through these segments, the company provides customers with a wide array of products and solutions. For the Commercial segment, for instance, the business is engaged in the design and production of fuselage sections for aircraft, as well as other products like flight control substances, horizontal and vertical stabilizers, wing structures, struts and pylons, and more. Under the Defense & Space segment, it produces fuselage, strut, nacelle, and wing aerostructures. It even provides training, engineering analysis, and more. For missiles and hypersonics, it produces solid rocket motor throats, nozzles, re-entry vehicle thermal protection systems, and more. Lastly, under the Aftermarket segment, the company provides maintenance, repair, and overhaul services, and provides products from its other two segments to customers on an as-needed basis.

Many companies that provide these types of products and services generate a lot of their revenue from the US government. However, that is not the case here. While Spirit AeroSystems absolutely does generate some revenue from government agencies, most of its revenue actually comes from none other than Boeing. From 2021 through 2023, the company saw its revenue grow from $3.95 billion to $6.05 billion. 64% of its revenue in 2023, amounting to $3.85 billion, came from its suitor. This was up significantly from the $2.21 billion generated by business with Boeing two years earlier.

Author - SEC EDGAR Data

It's the next largest customer, accounting for roughly 19% of sales last year, was Boeing competitor Airbus. Over the past three years, this customer was responsible for only a small portion of the company's revenue growth, with sales inching up from $945.6 million in 2021 to $1.14 billion last year. The rest of the company's revenue in 2023, about 17% in all, or $1.06 billion, was attributable to other miscellaneous customers like government agencies and other firms. This was up from $801.4 million back in 2021.

Growth for the company on the top line continued into the 2024 fiscal year. Overall revenue of $1.70 billion in the first quarter of the year beat out the $1.43 billion reported at the same time of 2023. Revenue from Boeing during this time expanded from $921.1 million to $1.09 billion. But we also saw growth from Airbus and other customers as well. Normally in a transaction like this, where the acquirer is buying a business that is already generating most of its revenue from the acquiring firm, the goal is not necessarily to generate more sales. In fact, any revenue generated by Spirit AeroSystems from Boeing after it is absorbed will ultimately be eliminated in consolidation. They are only major objective, then, would be to cut costs. But this seems to be an unlikely outcome to any significant extent.

Author - SEC EDGAR Data

The reason why I say this is because, as the chart above illustrates, Spirit AeroSystems has generated consistent net losses and cash outflows. Yes, EBITDA has been positive, but only marginally so. The picture has even gotten worse when it comes to the first quarter of 2024 relative to the same time last year. This is the problem with a company that, using data from 2023, has a gross profit margin of only 3.4%. In the past, Boeing clearly did business with Spirit AeroSystems because it could save money compared to doing things itself. And with these significant losses and cash outflows, it's difficult to imagine the management team at Boeing being able to cut costs by so much as to make this deal profitable.

This is not to say that some cost cutting cannot be had. There are some low hanging fruits. As of the most recent quarter, the weighted average interest rate for Boeing was only 4.75%. For Spirit AeroSystems, that number was 7.88%. This difference alone can result in $127.5 million in interest savings on an annualized basis. If we look at other expense and income items on the income statement, we might get other easy reductions of $101.3 million. It is possible that Boeing can also save materially on selling, general, and administrative costs, but it would be speculative to guess the extent to which this might be true.

This transaction also hinges on Spirit AeroSystems selling off the parts of its operations that do business with Airbus. Even if we assume that the enterprise value to sales multiple that Boeing is paying for Spirit AeroSystems is the same multiple that Spirit AeroSystems is able to get for its work with Airbus, that would reduce the effective purchase price by only $1.57 billion. This means that Boeing is ultimately paying $6.73 billion on an enterprise value basis for the prospect of some cost cuts and for revenue from other parties of about $1.06 billion. This translates to an enterprise value to net sales multiple that Boeing is paying of 6.37. That's well above the 1.96 multiple that Boeing itself is going for. This suggests that, unless Boeing can find a way to materially cut costs, this is going to be an expensive purchase for the business.

Takeaway

Because of the lack of detail that Boeing has decided to hit investors with, we don't really know the full value that the business is getting from this transaction. What we do know, however, is that this maneuver carries a lot of risks. The fact of the matter is that Boeing is making a large purchase for only a modest amount of incremental revenue. Unless it can cut costs significantly, which we have no evidence to justify such a hypothetical scenario, it's likely that the firm is overpaying for the business. Obviously, this would be a net benefit for Spirit AeroSystems since they are receiving a premium over where shares were trading prior to the announcement.

For those who believe that the transaction will go through and who are simultaneously bullish on Boeing, Spirit AeroSystems is a way to get some additional upside as opposed to buying Boeing directly. Of course, this is subject to the bounds of the exchange ratio. If you think, for instance, that shares of Boeing are going to be worth around $220 or more, it does actually just make more sense to buy into it as opposed to Spirit AeroSystems. Likewise, there is some downside protection for investors in Spirit AeroSystems that is worth considering. Personally, I view all of this in a rather neutral light. I think that the probability of the transaction going through is quite high. And if that is the case, Spirit AeroSystems will essentially be a bet on the success of Boeing. But seeing as how I am neutral on Boeing, I think that rating both companies a ’hold’ makes the most sense.","JHVEPhotoJuly 1st was definitely an interesting day for shareholders of both The Boeing Company (NYSE:BA) and Spirit AeroSystems Holdings (NYSE:SPR).

V.F. Corporation (NYSE:VFC) sells branded apparel, footwear, and accessories under a portfolio of brands. The brands include large, globally recognized names such as the North Face, Vans, Timberland, and Dickies, but also smaller brands including Icebreaker, Napapijri, JanSport, and Supreme which was acquired in 2020 for $2.1 billion.

The stock has lost the majority of its value from 2021 forward, with VFC’s poor brand management and expensive M&A strategy, leading to high debt and poorly performing brands. A thorough turnaround plan is in motion, but no effects were yet seen in Q4, as revenues declined by -13.4%.

Ten Year Stock Chart (Seeking Alpha)

VFC’s Lackluster Brand Performance Sees No End Yet

VFC has had a weak recent history of growing many of the company’s key brands. Vans, VFC’s largest brand until FY2024, revenues have shrunk from $4063.4 million in FY2020, prior to large Covid pandemic issues to just $2785.7 million in FY2024 at a CAGR of -9.0%. Timberland, the third largest VFC brand, has had a CAGR of -3.1% in the same period with Dickies following at a -1.1% CAGR – it seems that the company is unable to adapt to changing customer demand with many stagnant brands.

The 2020 acquisition of Supreme is also an example of VFC’s history of poorly led brands. The brand added around $500 million to VFC’s sales in FY2022, with ambitious plans to scale the growth into $1 billion through new stores, brand collaborations, and global expansion with VFC’s large global distribution network. Since Google Trends shows stable global search term volume for Supreme, and the company recorded goodwill and intangible asset impairment charges totaling $735 million in FY2023 with an additional $313.1 million in FY2024 due to the brand’s weak performance. VFC is now reportedly considering selling the business.

Author's Calculation Using VFC's 10-K Filing Data

The North Face brand is VFC’s outlier as the stagnant brand image from FY2014 to FY2017 has been turned around into an impressive CAGR of 8.0% from FY2020 to FY2024, as the company has become VFC’s largest brand. The rapid growth from the best-performing brand has started to stagnate too though, with -5.3% in year-over-year revenues in Q4 and a 1.7% growth in all of FY2024. The Q4 total revenue growth was -13.4%, showing one of VFC’s deepest revenue declines in recent history.

The poor sales performance has ultimately led to declining margins, as the operating margin in FY2024 was only 6.0% after a double-digit long-term level with an average of 11.4% from FY2016 to FY2020. Further declines pose a similar threat as well, as SG&A scales with inflation and failed growth initiatives against declining gross profit.

Don’t Take Reinvent Turnaround Plan Success at Face Value

To combat the poor performance, VFC introduced the Reinvent turnaround plan in the Q2/FY2024 report press release. The plan was introduced by Bracken Darrell, VFC’s new CEO that was appointed a few months prior to the plan’s announcement.

In the plan, VFC targets to improve results in North America with a change in the operating model, turn around the Vans brand with a new brand president appointment, cut costs by $300 million from fixed costs, and reduce debt – the changes reflect a key shift in VFC’s strategy, and a clear focus on changing Vans’ turnaround.

The $300 million in fixed cost reductions seems to be a great profitability driver, if successfully implemented without worsening organizational performance. Yet, a brand turnaround is needed for the company’s earnings to sustain, as margins have constantly taken a hit from lower sales, leveraged by VFC’s nearly $6 billion in interest-bearing debt.

I don’t believe that the Reinvent plan’s turnaround targets should be taken at face value before better demonstration from brands’ performance – a turnaround plan for Vans was already presented in the 2022 Investor Day for Vans, as was done for the North Face previously. Still, the Vans brand hasn’t yet even seen any stabilization several quarters later. Communicated growth targets for Timberland and Dickies have been missed as well, with continuous revenue declines.

The plan is now more thorough than the plan seen in the 2022 Investor Day, especially as Bracken Darrell was appointed as a new CEO to drive a change in the company. Bracken Darrell has an impressive resume, being the prior CEO of Logitech International (LOGI) and working in senior roles at Procter & Gamble (PG), Whirlpool (WHR), and General Electric (GE). Yet, leading fashion brands can be challenging, as maintaining and creating demand requires deep, constant customer and trend knowledge – while the new CEO is praised for the Old Spice brand turnaround, a similar turnaround of Vans could be more challenging, and likely requires a different type of branding strategy.

Performance continues to show no signs of improvements yet. Vans' sales declined by –26.3% in Q4, the North Face’s by -5.3%, Timberland’s by -13.7%, and Dickies’ by -15.2%. Other brands were near stable with a slight decline. The Vans search term still shows continued weakness on Google Trends.

More recently, in February, VFC announced that the company is going through a strategic portfolio review, and now seeks to potentially sell many of its smaller brands. The review could create upside, but no sales have been announced yet.

The Stock Valuation Prices In Too Much Improvements

I constructed a discounted cash flow [DCF] model to estimate a rough fair value for the stock. In the model, I factor a semi-successful turnaround, leaving margins higher than currently, but not quite at the long-term level.

For revenues, I estimate a -5% decline in FY2025, a -1.5% decline in FY2026, but a return into a better performance from FY2027 forward. From FY2026 to FY2034, I estimate the revenue CAGR at 3.4%, after which the growth ends at a perpetual 2%.

As VFC targets $300 million in cost savings, and as I estimate better revenues after a few years, I estimate the EBIT margin to be leveraged from 5.3% in FY2025 into an eventual 8.0%. The company has quite low capex and incremental working capital needs, making the cash flow conversion quite good.

DCF Model (Author's Calculation)

The estimates put VFC’s fair value estimate at $11.50, 17% below the stock price at the time of writing – even if the Reinvent turnaround plan shows good amount of improvements, the stock seems to have a moderate overvaluation. Good upside seems to require a near full brand turnaround, which I don’t believe that investors should yet expect.

A weighted average cost of capital of 8.06% is used in the DCF model. The used WACC is derived from a capital asset pricing model:

CAPM (Author's Calculation)

In Q4, VFC had $61.8 million in interest expenses, making the company’s interest rate 4.16% with the current amount of interest-bearing debt. I estimate a long-term debt-to-equity ratio of 60% due to VFC’s continued leveraged balance sheet, but plans for deleveraging. I believe that refinancing the debt would now likely result in a higher interest rate, posing a moderate risk to the cost of capital.

To estimate the cost of equity, I use the United States’ 10-year bond yield of 4.29% as the risk-free rate. The equity risk premium of 4.60% is Professor Aswath Damodaran’s latest estimate for the United States, updated on the 5th of January. Seeking Alpha estimates VFC’s beta at 1.42. Finally, I add a liquidity premium of 0.2%, creating a cost of equity of 11.02% and a WACC of 8.06%.

Notable Upside Risk

The bearish thesis still has a major upside risk – if the Vans turnaround turns out to be highly successful, a rise back into long-term margins and better growth could make the stock undervalued at the current price. At the FY2016-FY2020 average operating margin of 11.4% from FY2027 forward, the DCF model would estimate upside of 65%. Still, signs of such a turnaround aren’t yet seen, and such a scenario shouldn’t be priced as likely yet.

Also, the strategic alternative review could still well pose upside, if VFC is able to sell notable brands for a good price – the Timberland, Dickies, and Supreme brands could get VFC a good consideration if a potential buyer is more confident in leading the brands. Speculation around potential sales are rising, and a sale of one or more of VFC’s brands, in my opinion, is likely to happen at some point. Yet, the valuation in potential sales could be disappointing; sales aren’t a definite way to create upside.

I urge investors to watch the brand performance closely in the upcoming quarters, as a full turnaround could still be very valuable for shareholders.

Takeaway

VFC’s new CEO has started a significant turnaround plan to fix the underperforming brands. Costs are planned to be reduced dramatically, and Vans is planned to show a better performance through a leadership change and operational changes. Yet, investors shouldn’t believe in a near-full turnaround yet – a Vans turnaround has been tried for a while already, and Bracken Darrell doesn’t have a ton of experience in leading fashion brands, which could still prove to be a challenge. The Q4 performance also continues to show weakness across brands, with even the North Face now showing weakness after prior turnaround. The valuation seems to take good improvements as a base scenario, which I doubt for the time being. While brand sales or a turnaround could pose great upside, the risk-to-reward doesn’t seem good, and I initiate V.F.

Reddit,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1dtbnef/salesforce_shareholders_reject_compensation_plan/,2024-07-02,03:01:21 UTC,Dive into anything,"Salesforce investors voted against the company’s compensation plan for top executives, after shareholder advisory groups raised concerns about equity awards granted to CEO Marc Benioff.

According to a regulatory filing on Monday, the resolution to approve the compensation received 339.3 million votes in favor and 404.8 million against at the annual meeting held on Thursday.

The board had urged shareholders to vote in favor of the resolution. But two shareholder advisory firms, Glass Lewis and Institutional Shareholder Services, both recommended that investors vote down the measure.

For the 2024 fiscal year, Benioff received $39.6 million in total pay, up from $29.9 million in the prior year. While Benioff’s salary was flat at $1.55 million, he received additional stock and option awards and nonequity incentive plan compensation, according to the proxy statement. The most recent sum also included security fees that had not previously been invoiced to the company.

In January, the board’s compensation committee gave Benioff a second long-term equity award worth $20 million, in recognition of the company’s “successful transformation actions and strong financial performance in the fiscal year,” among other factors.

Glass Lewis wrote in its recommendation that “shareholders may reasonably be wary of the substantial discretionary equity grants” issued to Benioff in January, adding that there was a “lack of a fully convincing rationale” behind the grants.

Benioff was already among the largest holders of Salesforce, with a stake of over 2% valued at close to $6 billion. Glass Lewis said in its proxy paper that the additional performance-based restricted stock units and stock options were “unwarranted” because his interests were already aligned with that of shareholders.

The vote from the annual meeting is nonbinding.

“Our Compensation Committee, which is responsible for designing and administering our executive compensation program, values the opinions expressed by our stockholders and will consider the outcome of this vote when making future executive compensation decisions,” Salesforce’s board said in the company’s proxy statement.

The company declined to comment.

Salesforce shares rose 67% in the 2024 fiscal year ended Jan. 31, the strongest performance since 2011.

Net income jumped to $4.1 billion in the fiscal year from $208 million a year earlier, while revenue increased 11% to $34.9 billion from $31.4 billion. In January 2023, Salesforce announced plans to lay off 10% of employees, after activist investors began buying up stakes and demanding a better mix of profit and growth. Salesforce said in February it would begin paying a dividend to shareholders.

Salesforce shares are off 2.6% year to date.

Reddit,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1dtbq74/paramount_hunts_for_a_streaming_partner_could/,2024-07-02,03:05:32 UTC,Dive into anything,"Paramount Global is holding talks with other entertainment companies about merging its Paramount+ streaming service with an existing platform. If it reaches a deal, it may kick off a new wave of streaming partnerships that could put the entire media industry on firmer footing.

Paramount Global leadership is having active discussions with other media and tech company executives to determine if a structure makes sense for both parties where Paramount+ can be merged with another streaming entity and potentially co-owned, according to people familiar with the matter, who asked not to be named because the discussions are private.

One of the companies that has expressed a desire to reach a deal is Warner Bros. Discovery, according to people familiar with the matter. Combining Max and Paramount+ could strengthen both services by allowing them to better compete with Netflix and Disney’s suite of platforms (Disney+, Hulu and ESPN) for eyeballs and future content.

Warner Bros. Discovery held preliminary merger talks for a deal for all of Paramount Global earlier this year, but talks didn’t escalate.

Paramount Global is also considering partnering with a technology platform, the company’s co-CEO Chris McCarthy said at an employee town hall on June 25.

“What they don’t have is our scale of content, and together we will make for a very powerful combination to drive more minutes and greater profits,” McCarthy said of a potential tech partner at the town hall, according to a transcript of the event obtained by CNBC.

A merged streaming service would mitigate churn by giving customers more diverse programming and fewer reasons to cancel each month, and it could take Paramount+ losses off Paramount Global’s balance sheet by giving it new ownership.

While a structure for a hypothetical joint venture with Warner Bros. Discovery hasn’t been discussed in detail, ownership likely wouldn’t be a 50-50 split given the existing natures of the streaming assets and their finances, according to people familiar with the discussions.

Warner Bros. Discovery’s direct-to-consumer business made $103 million in annual adjusted EBITDA in 2023 after losing $2.1 billion the year before. Paramount Global reported a loss of $1.67 billion in direct-to-consumer operating income before depreciation and amortization in 2023, narrower than its $1.8 billion loss a year prior.

Max has about 100 million global subscribers, with 52.7 million based in the U.S. Paramount+ ended its first quarter with 71 million subscribers.

Comcast’s NBCUniversal has also expressed interest in a joint venture with Paramount+, as The Wall Street Journal first reported earlier this year. The talks didn’t progress and never got particularly far, according to people familiar with the matter.

“The sheer volume of hit content that we could offer together would be tremendous across TV, film and sports, and would attract millions of viewers,” McCarthy said during the town hall in reference to a potential partnership with an existing subscription streaming service like Max or Peacock. “Plus, we would share in all other non-content expenses.”

Spokespeople for Warner Bros. Discovery, NBCUniversal and Paramount Global declined to comment.

Streaming 2.0

Since late 2019, traditional media companies including Paramount Global, Disney, NBCUniversal and Warner Bros. Discovery have all launched streaming services that have hemorrhaged billions of dollars in losses.

There’s long been consensus in the industry that there are too many streaming services relative to the number of total paying customers. Many executives have speculated that just four or five global services can likely survive and flourish. The others would need to be consolidated or folded into existing platforms.

“There may be some combination of Paramount, Peacock and Max,” said Peter Chernin, former CEO and chairman of Fox Group, in an interview with CNBC last year.

If Paramount reaches an agreement on a joint venture with either Max or Peacock, there would be added pressure on whichever service is left out to do a deal of its own.

Media companies are now focused on better monetizing streaming content through bundles and partnerships. Disney and Warner Bros. Discovery have recently become more willing to license some of their content to rival streaming services, such as Netflix, to better monetize shows that aren’t adding a lot of new subscribers to their streaming services.

Comcast recently introduced a bundle of Peacock, Netflix and Apple TV+ for its cable, broadband and mobile customers for $15 a month.

Disney and Warner Bros. Discovery announced they plan to bundle their streaming services beginning in the summer. While the companies haven’t yet announced a price for the package, which will include Disney+, Hulu and Max, the discount will be “significant,” according to one of the people familiar with the matter.

Better windowing

Another hot topic of current discussions revolve around windowing movies and TV series through different streaming services at different price points.

This idea was something considered by Skydance Media, which nearly acquired Paramount Global before talks broke down last month.

Skydance’s plan for Paramount included merging Paramount+ with another streamer to create new streaming services which would better rationalize the assets, according to people familiar with the matter.

For example, Paramount’s Showtime library could be combined with another company’s prestige dramas to create a stand-alone ad-free service.

A different ad-supported service could then contain live sports and windowed prestige originals, which could appear on the second service after a certain amount of time. The services could be bundled together, such as how Disney bundles Disney+, Hulu and ESPN+.

A representative for Skydance declined to comment.

One app experience

There’s a widespread shared sentiment among traditional media leadership that better packaging of existing content can be more lucrative for the entire industry.

The downside to more bundling or windowing of content is customer confusion. Increased mix-and-match offers between streaming services can easily lead to customer frustration rather than satisfaction.

Several media executives said privately they expect Peacock, Paramount+, Max and Disney could ultimately team up their programming within one application to alleviate confusion and compete with Netflix, which dominates the subscription streaming industry with about 270 million global subscribers.

Two executives said Disney would be the most likely company to own the application, given its relative dominant position in the entertainment streaming industry. Any media company who contributed content to the streaming application could share in the revenue, similar to how cable economics work today, they added.

Still, company rivalries and tensions may make such a product difficult to put together. While Max and Disney have struck a bundling deal, Comcast and Disney have long had a strained relationship. The two parties are currently trying to unwind a joint venture — Hulu — to give Disney full control over the service that was initially co-owned by NBCUniversal, Fox and Disney.

Reddit,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1dsqlu5/boeing_agrees_to_buy_fuselage_maker_spirit/,2024-07-01,11:25:21 UTC,Dive into anything,"Boeing said Monday that it will buy back its struggling fuselage maker Spirit AeroSystems in an all-stock deal that the planemaker has said will improve safety and quality control.

It said it agreed to pay $37.25 a share in Boeing stock for Spirit, giving the aerospace company an equity value of $4.7 billion. Including Spirit’s debt the deal has a transaction value of $8.3 billion Boeing said. Spirit’s shares closed Friday at $32.87 a share, giving it a market capitalization of about $3.8 billion.

Boeing in March disclosed that it was in talks to acquire the Wichita, Kansas-based company, weeks after a fuselage panel blew out midair from a nearly new Boeing 737 Max 9 on an Alaska Airlines flight, sparking a fresh crisis for Boeing. Spirit makes the fuselages for the 737 and other parts, including sections of Boeing’s 787 Dreamliners.

In 2005, Boeing spun off operations in Kansas and Oklahoma that became the present-day Spirit AeroSystems. Boeing accounted for about 70% of Spirit’s revenue last year, while roughly a quarter came from making parts for Boeing’s main rival, Airbus, according to a securities filing.

CEO Dave Calhoun, who has said he will step down at the end of the year, on Monday said bringing Spirit in-house will “fully align” the companies’ production systems and workforces.

“Among the many actions we’re taking as a company, this is one of the most significant in demonstrating our unwavering commitment to strengthen quality and make certain that Boeing is the company the world needs it to be,” Dave Calhoun said in a message to employees.

He said he expects the deal to close mid-2025, subject to approval by regulators, Spirit shareholders and the sale of Spirit’s operators dedicated to Airbus planes.

Spirit’s CEO Pat Shanahan is considered a possible replacement for Calhoun.

Airbus, meanwhile, said Monday it has reached an agreement with Spirit so that the European aircraft manufacturer is compensated $559 million by Spirit to acquire its manufacturing lines dedicated to Airbus planes. Those include operations in Belfast, Northern Ireland, where the wings and mid-fuselage of the A220 is produced, A220 pylons in Wichita, Kansas, and A350 fuselage sections in North Carolina.

Mounting pressure

A preliminary report from the National Transportation Safety Board into the Jan. 5 accident said it appeared the bolts that hold the door plug in place weren’t attached to the Max 9 when it left Boeing’s factory and was handed over to Alaska Airlines months before the accident.

That was the most serious of a host of production problems on Boeing planes, which also included Spirit-made fuselages that had misdrilled holes and misconnected fuselage panels.

The crisis stemming from the door-plug blowout on the Alaska flight has slowed Boeing’s deliveries of new planes to airlines, and has driven financial hits for both Spirit and Boeing. Boeing’s CFO in May said the company would burn, rather than generate cash this year—about $8 billion in the first half of 2024. Boeing’s shares are down more than 30% this year.

One way Boeing has tried to improve quality is to accept only fuselages without defects so that repairs or additional manufacturing steps won’t have to be made out of sequence, reducing the changes of errors.

The Federal Aviation Administration has said it won’t let Boeing expand production until it is satisfied with its production lines.

Calhoun was skewered by lawmakers in a June Senate hearing over the company’s safety record and what some Senators lamented was a lack of improvement in the wake of two deadly Max crashes.

Even though the sale fell through it did get a baseline price of what the company could be worth for future suitors.

Without that acquisition I was neutral on the company as it is a very competitive market although DocuSign does have the brand recognition, I felt other companies like adobe etc could replicate this software with ease.

I use adobe e signature at work and honestly it is so bad. I am unfamiliar with other competitors and have used DocuSign in the past for my mortgage and it was a breeze.

With the acquisition they seem to be venturing more into making workflow of contracts easier on top of the one trick pony e signature.

I don’t have enough knowledge of contract software to know how much different it is to simple e signatures. Like for example getting sushi at a gas station difference or is this something they could integrate easily and become competitive in that market. Honestly I don’t even know who the best contract software company is right now.

We all know the Covid boom really took this companies stock on a rollercoaster but what it did in the positive is brand name recognition. How much value that has idk.

The metrics of this company seem to be going in a positive direction and they have consistently been building their user base, cash flow and profits.

This is a daily watchlist for trading.

I might trade all the stocks on here, or none of them, on any given day. I might trade stocks that do not appear on here! I hold no positions in any stocks long-term but Amazon/Mag7/general broad market indices. (unless otherwise noted in these tickers). If you are on old reddit, click “show images” at the top to see all the charts quickly.

I usually make these watchlists premarket, but can be delayed if I am trading the open. These are not mean to be taken as gospel or any recommendation to buy/sell.

Many stocks I post are <$500M market cap. These are potentially good candidates to day trade; I have no opinion on them as investments. PLEASE ask specific ones. Questions like “Thoughts on _____?” will be ignored unless you add detail to the question. “Is ___ a good investment?” will be ignored. I will block you if you are a troll.

News: Biden Allies Dismiss Calls to Quit in Frenetic Weekend Blitz

I’ll likely not be posting on Wednesday because the market closes early, and those days are typically pretty slow. Happy early fourth of July everyone!

CHWY- SEC filing reveals 6.6% stake by DFV. Watching this closely at open, and at $30/$35/$40 levels. For everyone who said it wasn’t his tweet that made the stock spike from 28 ->39

GME- Fell likely due to DFV’s reveal of his stake in CHWY. (WOOF as well)

SPR- BA agrees to buy SPR in $4.7B deal, SPR makes fuselages (the main body) for planes.

NKE- Earnings last Thursday, cut full-year guidance and said it expects sales to drop 10% during current quarter. I’m watching to see if we bounce at the open. Have a small position long but nothing huge in this.

AMZN- We nearly hit that $200 level yesterday and the day before, will continue to watch this but will remove from list (or keep as a footnote) tomorrow.","I might trade all the stocks on here, or none of them, on any given day.

Reddit,https://www.reddit.com/r/StockMarket/comments/1ds840v/sharing_research_on_pltr_after_tons_of_weekend/,2024-06-30,18:32:30 UTC,Dive into anything,"Sometimes, I see the name on Reddit…

...sometimes, the ticker pops up on StockTwits…

…sometimes, my friends and coworkers tell me about the gains they make from this ticker…

But after 3 weekend articles by Motley Fool surrounding Palantir Technologies, and while I look for my next long-term buy and hold going into Monday, as well as the inevitable rise of artificial intelligence over the next few years, I figured it was time…

…time for THE ULTIMATE DUE DILLIGENCE REPORT ON $PLTR - get your minds right and lock it in, because this is about to be some no-joke fucking research.

For a cute elevator-intro, Palantir Technologies ($PLTR ~ NYSE) was founded in 2003 by Peter Thiel, Alex Karp, and Stephen Cohen, with the mission to transform commercialized data analytics through the power of artificial intelligence.

The company develops software products for large institutions and government agencies that allows enormous data sets to be analyzed in just seconds.

Imagine blinking and you have a Pivot Table on Excel, except the data set is made up of a statewide census 🤯.

Looking at some basic financial valuations on the fundamental side, Palantir market cap is listed as $45 billion, while reeling in $2.21 billion in revenue in 2023 for a net income of $341 million. EPS in 2023 capped at $0.18.For profitability, the company reported an 81% gross margin in 2023, plus a net margin of 10%.

^I know, that is boring shit but it matters for a buy-and-hodl deal {;)}.

After at all that mumbo-jumbo, the big names in Wall Street research think that $PLTR is a ‘buy-and-hold’ for years to come - like I said, Motley Fool, Yahoo Finance, even Zacks.com, although they gave them a Zacks rating of #3 for the short-term, which means that they’re likely to move in the same direction as the market.

Now, with the SPX falling off a cliff in the back half of the trading day on Friday 6/28, I don’t know if a 2.69 5Y Beta stock is the best place to move position into, but July historically is a month for the Bulls - maybe $PLTR is MJ.

Moving right along, $PLTR closed the trading day 6/28 at $25.33 a share, after a 6.25% rise on the week, compared to $SPX’s stagnancy in the same period.

$PLTR has been up for inclusion on the S&P 500 since 2023, but has yet to make the cut - yet it seems to have a lot of attention.

Palantir Tech barely missed earnings projections by 1.59% just a short year ago, but since then has hit the market on all the analyst’s projections - their YOY earnings for the last missed projection is set to release in 36 days - this will be detrimental to the future of their shareholders.

Let’s size-up against the comp.

Being in big-tech and big-data puts you up against some big names. IBM is running the sector for data and AI innovation and Snowflake is on a popularity rise bigger than Palantir.

Nonetheless, $PLTR, has established secure government contracts like those of their competitors, but the business is heavily reliant on those contracts as it stands.

However, when your business model is centered around AI, I find it hard to believe that there won’t be further innovation from the company that can propel itself past the Titans o’ Tech, but the Bears have faked us out with the candlesticks before.

The Bear argument is centered around the dependency on government contracts and skepticism around the security of these lump-sums of data Palantir has at their disposal.

But the way a subreddit can be protected by AI Mod bots, I’m taking AI in 4 games against any hacker lol.

Artificial Intelligence is an immediate advantage in today's day and age, but more and more PTOs are taking advantage of the emerging flame - the team at Palantir will have their work cut out for them, but their advanced solutions and strong government relationships give me security for a long-term hold.

The Set Up

Plain and simple - we’re looking for a confirmed break over $27.45, buy, and forget my friends.

Let’s see what we get out of this squad in Denver. Hope you guys enjoyed the read and found something valuable here. Per usual, NFA.

Yeah, I've read enough to know that you're either a pumper or basher, and I'm neither. But I have a few questions if any of you can manage to be kind enough to answer.

Almost every post here (and on other message boards) complain about dark pools, naked shorting, stock price manipulation and many other illegal behaviors done by the so-called ""Big Money"" to steal money from you ""little people"". It's happening daily, constantly...for years? Maybe decades? I don't know. But isn't that criminal, and if so, why hasn't the SEC done anything about it? Why isn't this top World News? If those few things are indeed happening, then I can see why the smart people will never buy stocks. Personally, I think of investing as something you do for a POSITIVE return. But based on many your posts, you are all just trying to break even all the time! Lol, you are in a persistent losing mode. That's not investing. That's freely donating money to strangers and then asking them to kick you in the balls while they take it. Do you consider yourself an investor or a gambler? Correct me if I'm wrong, but if a company is doing well, meaning...the CEO and Board are making money quarter after quarter, year after year, why is it okay with you that your ownership is devalued? As part owner, does it not make sense to you that you should share in the revenues?

My intention is not to insult anyone, but as one who is forced to see a little of stock market stuff whenever I am casually watching TV, I just wonder why you do it. The homeless guy pandering on the highway corner is probably making more money than the average trader. Just sayin'

EDIT: 21 responses, downvoted (oh how shocking!) and I can see that only RaspingHaddock wants to discuss truths...why are the rest of you avoiding it? Does it make you angry or distressed or worried when people who notice things speak out? Is this stockmarket sub about discussing the stock market, or is it about hyping it? Is it about covering the truth by keeping everyone in the dark...distracted...entertained? I'd wager that most of you are trying to make money off those who are too stupid to know better...because that, my friends, makes the most sense considering how unwilling you are to get into the details that make up this so-called ""Fraud Market"". I am making the allegation...now it's incumbent upon you all who credit it so much to make your rebuttals. Explain why those three observations I made above are incorrect. If you can't do it, that means it's true.","That's freely donating money to strangers and then asking them to kick you in the balls while they take it.

We can see the trendlines coming all the way from 2018 local peak and the COVID-19 bottom, after which we experienced a significant bull market. We should read these trendlines as uptrend, BUT we can clearly see that the overall pattern is called an ascending channel or even a wedge since it is not broadening, nor closing. This pattern breaks to the downside over 80% of the times. Though, this frequently (since, not always) comes from a rejection from the upper trendline. Here, we can see that the most recent major level we tested was the lower trendline, which powered the price to start moving towards the upper trendline, which will act as a resistance and eventuate the pattern by starting to move towards the lower trendline, so as to break it and move lower. So, the ultimate scenario is breaking the the channel to the downside, either after we make contact with the upper trendline, or at any moment, just start moving lower. To be clear, I'm not going to take some kind of a Big Short, but being able to analyze macro trends is important in day-to-day life as well. As a sidenote, in general, we take an entry when the price closes below the trendline. So, in this case, we'd take an entry if the price was to close below the lower trendline. Though price likes to retrace back up to the lower trendline and reject from there to the downside, which usually is not a problem if the pattern is one-sided enough.","Though, this frequently (since, not always) comes from a rejection from the upper trendline.

The median price of a home sold in May was $419,300 — an all-time record. As we know the stock market is at all time highs as well. Now lets look at what's driving the stock market to all time highs, not hard to figure it out its big tech. Wall St has a love fest with big tech right now. Just buy big tech and get rich right? Not so quick, those of you that remember the dot.com bubble in the 90's remember how that ended. Between March 2000 and October 2002, the NASDAQ fell from 5,048 to 1,139, erasing nearly all of its gains during the dot-com bubble. By the end of 2001, most publicly traded dot-com companies had failed. I was a trader back then and bought many penny stocks that skyrocketed in price during the dot.com boom. Lucky for me I cashed out around the highs before most of them went bankrupt. This brings me to the current AI-boom which I missed out on. I am not saying the AI-boom is not justified. However, the market has already deemed the new winners. Just like it was during the dotcom boom there were winners but many went bankrupt. We shall see how the AI boom evolves, but when a sector is only thing leading the market to new highs history tells us a crash will follow.

Now lets look at housing. I lived through the first major correction in the housing market in 2008. I took my gains from the 90s dotcom boom and invested in real estate soon after. I got lucky and sold most of my real estate right before it crashed in 2008. The stock market and housing market crashes of 2008 trace their origins to the unprecedented growth of the subprime mortgage market that began in 1999. Could we have a repeat of previous events? Right now average people can not afford a home. Why is this? Could it be Wall St has become a major buyer of real estate remembering the government bailed them out last time, who knows. What I do know is what my ole grandpappy used to say, what goes up must come down. Baby boomers own most real estate and will soon be major sellers due to death or downsizing, this is just facts. Right now, boomers have a pretty large grip on the US housing market. The generation accounts for about 21% of the total US population, but they own 38% of American homes We shall see what happens in the future but history always repeats its self.

CHEERS!!

Until recently, vendors along Hollywood Boulevard were operating outside the law. And while that legal cloud has lifted, eking out a living remains a challenge. Cost-conscious tourists sometimes scoff at the prices, even if sellers struggle to break even. And while longtime street vendors respect and recognize the turf of other regulars, there are more sellers working in the area, and competition has increased.","“I knew I wanted to have my own business,” Mrs. Monrroy said on a recent weekday afternoon on Hollywood Boulevard, where her childhood wish has come true.

The Personal Consumption Expenditures index climbed 2.6 percent in May from a year earlier, matching what economists had forecast and down from 2.7 percent previously.

After stripping out volatile food and fuel prices to give a better sense of the inflation trend, a “core” price measure was also up 2.6 percent from a year earlier, down from 2.8 percent in the April reading. And on a monthly basis, inflation was especially mild, and prices did not climb on an overall basis.

The Fed is likely to watch the fresh inflation data closely as central bankers think about their next policy steps. Officials raised interest rates sharply starting in 2022 to hit the brakes on consumer and business demand, which in turn can help to slow price increases. But they have held borrowing costs steady at 5.3 percent since July as inflation has slowly come down, and have been contemplating when to begin lowering interest rates.","The Federal Reserve’s preferred inflation measure continued to cool as consumer spending grew only moderately, good news for central bankers who have been trying to weigh down demand and wrestle price increases under control.

Trump took to social media to share one of his central economic philosophies: “Trade wars are good, and easy to win.”

As president, Mr. Trump presided over the biggest increase in U.S. tariffs since the Great Depression, hitting China, Canada, the European Union, Mexico, India and other governments with stiff levies. They hit back, imposing tariffs on American soybeans, whiskey, orange juice and motorcycles. U.S. agricultural exports plummeted, prompting Mr. Trump to send $23 billion to farmers to help offset losses.

Now, as he runs for president again, Mr. Trump is promising to ratchet up his trade war to a much greater degree. He has proposed “universal baseline tariffs on most foreign products,” including higher levies on certain countries that devalue their currency. In interviews, he has floated plans for a 10 percent tariff on most imports and a tariff of 60 percent or more on Chinese goods. He has also posited cutting the federal income tax and relying on tariffs for revenue instead.

Mr. Trump, who once proclaimed himself “Tariff Man,” has long argued that tariffs would boost American factories, end the gap between what America imported and what it exported and increase American jobs.","They hit back, imposing tariffs on American soybeans, whiskey, orange juice and motorcycles.

Others have also expressed interest in acquiring National Amusements, including the media and finance executive Edgar Bronfman Jr. and Steven Paul, the Hollywood executive best known for his work on the “Baby Geniuses” franchise.

A bid to take control of Paramount would be a coda of sorts for Mr. Diller, 82, who tried to acquire Paramount Pictures in the early ’90s. He was outbid by Sumner Redstone, the bellicose media mogul whose daughter, Shari, now controls the company.

Mr. Diller was named head of Paramount Pictures in 1974 at the age of 32. He was credited with rejuvenating the studio, developing a cadre of talented lieutenants, like the future Disney chief executive Michael Eisner and the studio wunderkind Jeffrey Katzenberg, that became known as the Killer Dillers.

After Mr. Redstone outbid him for the company, Mr. Diller set his sights on continuing to build his new media empire, striking a series of audacious deals to expand IAC.

“They won,” Mr. Diller said in a statement after losing out to Mr. Redstone. “We lost. Next.”

National Amusements began exploring potential deals last year. As part of its talks with Skydance, Shari Redstone, the largest shareholder at National Amusements, would sell the company to Skydance, while Paramount would merge with Skydance through a separate transaction. That deal was scuttled after they could not agree on noneconomic terms after significant shareholder pushback.","It’s unclear how far along the talks between IAC and National Amusements are.

Eight-figure pay packages — rare a decade ago — are increasingly common for corporate lawyers at the top of their game, and many of these new heavy hitters have one thing in common: private equity.

In recent years, highly profitable private equity giants like Apollo, Blackstone and KKR have moved beyond company buyouts into real estate, private lending, insurance and other businesses, amassing trillions of dollars in assets. As their demand for legal services has skyrocketed, they have become big revenue drivers for law firms.

This is pushing up lawyers’ pay across the industry, including at some of Wall Street’s most prestigious firms, such as Kirkland & Ellis; Simpson Thacher & Bartlett; Davis Polk; Latham & Watkins; and Paul, Weiss, Rifkind, Wharton & Garrison. Lawyers with close ties to private equity increasingly enjoy pay and prestige similar to those of star lawyers who represent America’s blue-chip companies and advise them on high-profile mergers, takeover battles and litigation.","Hotshot Wall Street lawyers are now so in demand that bidding wars between firms for their services can resemble the frenzy among teams to sign star athletes.

Says","When Meta introduced a subscription option last year that would allow users in the European Union to pay for an advertising-free experience of Instagram and Facebook, it was meant to fix regulatory problems the company faced in the region.

The plan created new legal headaches instead.

On Monday, European Union regulators said Meta’s subscription, which costs up to 12.99 euros a month, amounted to a “pay or consent” scheme that required users to choose between paying a fee or handing over more personal data to Meta to use for targeted advertising.

Meta introduced the subscription last year as a way to address regulatory and legal scrutiny of its advertising-based business model. Of most concern was the company’s combination of data collected about users across its different platforms — including Facebook, Instagram and WhatsApp — along with information pulled from other websites and apps.

Meta argued that by offering a subscription, users had a fair alternative.

But regulators on Monday said the system was no choice at all, forcing users to pay for privacy. The authorities said Meta’s policy violated the Digital Markets Act, a new law aimed at reining in the power of the biggest tech companies.","When Meta introduced a subscription option last year that would allow users in the European Union to pay for an advertising-free experience of Instagram and Facebook, it was meant to fix regulatory problems the company faced in the region.

In buying Spirit, Boeing hopes to stem quality problems that have plagued the supplier in recent years. While it already has significant influence over Spirit, Boeing will more easily be able to monitor and change production practices by owning the business outright. Boeing has taken internal steps to improve quality, too, after a harrowing incident in which a panel blew out of one of its planes on a flight in January.

“By reintegrating Spirit,” Boeing’s chief executive, Dave Calhoun, said in a statement, the company “can fully align” its production and safety systems with its work force.

The deal, which was widely expected, was valued at $4.7 billion in stock or $8.3 billion including Spirit’s debt. It must be approved by regulators and Spirit’s shareholders to be completed.

The early results are not promising.

Only 113,000 cars qualified for trade-in subsidies through June 25 — a blip in a country where monthly sales exceed two million cars. And buyers of new appliances such as washing machines and refrigerators are being offered discounts of only about 10 percent, depending on what city they live in.

The incentives are not enough to bring customers into stores.

“If it is not needed, people will not go out of their way to find an old machine to participate,” said Dai Yu, the manager of an appliance store in Jingdezhen, a city in Jiangxi Province in south-central China.

The idea of providing financial incentives to spur consumer spending is not new.

In 2009, the United States, Germany, France, Spain and Austria offered so-called cash for clunkers programs to revive car sales. They paid households to scrap gas guzzlers and replace them with newer cars with better fuel economy. China itself gave extensive tax cuts and subsidies for consumers to buy new cars and household appliances. Prices for many appliances were cut in half, particularly for rural residents, and sales surged.","Four months ago, China’s leaders announced what seemed like a straightforward and proven plan to recharge the economy: Subsidize consumers who want to replace old cars and household appliances.

That frees the administration to cut certain borrowers’ payments by as much as half, a benefit that had been previously scheduled but blocked.

The order, from the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 10th Circuit in Denver, is the latest twist in a saga that began to unfold last week after two federal judges temporarily suspended parts of the plan known as SAVE. That program, which has about eight million enrollees, ties borrowers’ monthly payment amounts to their income and household size.

Two judges, one in Kansas and another in Missouri, last Monday issued separate preliminary injunctions, which are tied to lawsuits that were filed in the spring by two groups of Republican-led states that seek to upend the SAVE program.

The Kansas order suspended parts of the program that were not yet in place, including a big decrease in monthly payments for people with undergraduate debt — to 5 percent of their discretionary income from 10 percent — which was to take effect on July 1. The judge in Missouri blocked new debt cancellation through the SAVE program, though legal experts initially said it wasn’t clear how widely that ruling should be interpreted.","Major components of President Biden’s student loan repayment plan can continue to operate as lawsuits challenging it wind through the legal system, a federal appellate court ruled on Sunday.

The lawsuit, filed in New York Supreme Court in Manhattan, accuses Fox of violating a so-called revenge porn law in New York State that was passed in 2019. The law allows people to sue anyone who shares their sexually explicit photos and videos without permission.

“Fox published and disseminated these intimate images to its vast audience of millions as part of an entertainment program in order to humiliate, harass, annoy and alarm Mr. Biden and to tarnish his reputation,” the lawsuit states.","President Biden’s son Hunter Biden sued Fox News on Sunday, arguing that a mini-series produced by the company broke the law by sharing explicit photos and videos of him without his permission.

Saudi Arabia has become one of the few reliable sources of growth for the Trump family’s business operations, as new real estate deals in the United States have slowed or stopped since the Jan. 6, 2021, assault on the Capitol and since former President Donald J. Trump left the White House.

This new deal is like other international projects the Trump family has signed over the past decade. It offers the family’s name and brand to a well-financed developer that will build the project and sell luxury resident units, it hopes at a premium, based on the marketability of the former president’s perceived star power.

The vote was 6 to 3, split along ideological lines. Justice Amy Coney Barrett, writing for the conservative majority, rejected the government’s argument that the time limit to sue begins when an agency issues a rule.

Under the government’s view, she wrote, “only those fortunate enough to suffer an injury within six years of a rule’s promulgation” could sue.

The shock waves from last week’s presidential debate are still reverberating, as President Biden and his aides sought to allay concerns from despondent Democrats and wealthy donors about his age and fitness for office.

Donors are increasingly becoming reconciled to Biden remaining the Democratic nominee even after Biden’s disastrous performance. But some in the party, and in the markets, are increasingly expecting Donald Trump to win in November.

Here’s the latest fallout from the debate. Seventy-two percent of registered voters don’t believe Biden has the mental and cognitive health to serve as president, according to a CBS News poll published Sunday, compared with 65 percent in early June.

With the odds for a Trump win rising after the debate, Wall Street analysts are recalculating what that could mean for the economy and the markets. Among their forecasts are a slowdown in growth and resurgence in inflation that could muddle the Fed’s interest rate policy, especially if Trump carries out his proposals for mass deportation of undocumented migrants and higher tariffs.","Donors still on edgeThe shock waves from last week’s presidential debate are still reverberating, as President Biden and his aides sought to allay concerns from despondent Democrats and wealthy donors about his age and fitness for office.

Shields’s candidacy was a surprise, even to herself.

She was a childhood model, a preteen movie star, a sex object and an icon of beauty, all before she went off to college (Princeton, thank you very much). In the years since, she has acted onscreen and onstage, has written books, has spoken widely, particularly about depression, and has become a symbol and a subject for an evolving discussion about how women and girls have been sexualized by the entertainment and fashion industries.","Brooke Shields has a new office.

We don’t yet have “Madoff: The Musical,” but years after his 2021 death from kidney disease in a federal prison hospital, Bernie the Ponzi-scheming potentate keeps yielding cultural dividends. An experimental film shown at Lincoln Center. A Netflix documentary series, “The Monster of Wall Street.” And now, adding to a fat stack that includes a coloring book and an exposé by a New York Times reporter that generated its own Robert De Niro movie, a new prose probe entitled “Madoff: The Final Word.”

Final? As its own author, Richard Behar, admits: doubtful.

A longtime investigative journalist who has taken on, among other formidable institutions, the litigious Church of Scientology, Behar spent 15 years seemingly half-shackled to and half-tickled by this, his first book. Along with many, many secondary interviews, he visited Madoff in prison thrice; talked to him on the phone about 50 times; and received from him dozens of handwritten letters and hundreds of emails.(He’s far from the first or only reporter to have visited the man in the clink, but the passage of time has loosened some auxiliary tongues — though death has stilled others.)

For every dollar he stole, Madoff seems to have generated at least one piece of regular paper. The hoard of 30 million documents he didn’t manage to destroy, Behar writes, “is nearly half the size of the printed material collection of the U.S. Library of Congress.” The shredding operation Madoff ran starting in the mid-90s, in a Brooklyn facility now called Tuck-It-Away, was like an A.S.M.R. orgy: burlap bags of the scraps taken to a nearby recycling plant, his secrets “dissolving to mulch.”","MADOFF: The Final Word, by Richard BeharWe don’t yet have “Madoff: The Musical,” but years after his 2021 death from kidney disease in a federal prison hospital, Bernie the Ponzi-scheming potentate keeps yielding cultural dividends.

Scientists failed to find evidence that the virus can spread as a respiratory infection. Juergen Richt, a virologist at Kansas State University who helped lead the research, said that the results suggested that the virus is mainly infectious via contaminated milking machines.

In an interview, Dr. Richt said that the results offered hope that the outbreak could be halted before the virus evolved into a form that could spread readily between humans.

“I think this is good news that we can most likely control it easier than people thought,” Dr. Richt said. “Hopefully we can now kick this thing in the behind and knock it out.”","Ever since scientists discovered influenza infecting American cows earlier this year, they have been puzzling over how it spreads from one animal to another.

Julian Assange Lit the Fuse.,"On the morning of April 5, 2010, a tall, thin man with a shock of silver hair walked up to a lectern at the National Press Club in Washington, D.C. He’d been operating an obscure news website out of Iceland for four years, trying and failing to find a scoop that would set the world on fire. Many of the 40 or so journalists (myself included) who showed up had barely heard of him.

Still, it was hard to ignore his pitch. Three days earlier, we had received an email promising a “previously unseen classified video” with “dramatic proof and new facts.”

But even this bit of hype might have undersold what happened after the man, Julian Assange, pressed play. The nature of proof — the volume and granularity of digital evidence, along with the pathways through which it comes to light — was about to change.

Before, information that leaked from insiders to the public was largely circumscribed by the limitations of paper. In 1969, it had taken Daniel Ellsberg an entire night to surreptitiously photocopy a secret study of the Vietnam War that would become known as the Pentagon Papers.","Many of the 40 or so journalists (myself included) who showed up had barely heard of him.

Growing up in Guatemala, Ruth Monrroy often spent time at her mother’s restaurant watching in awe of how she connected with customers.

“I knew I wanted to have my own business,” Mrs. Monrroy said on a recent weekday afternoon on Hollywood Boulevard, where her childhood wish has come true.

Mrs. Monrroy, 44, parks her metal cart in front of the TCL Chinese Theater six days a week, selling items including fruit salad, hot dogs and energy drinks.

“Mango, water, soda, Gatorade, hot dog!” she calls out to the crowds traipsing over Hollywood Walk of Fame stars dedicated to Bruce Willis and Billy Crystal.

Street vending is a quintessential California job — from the pickup trucks selling cartons of strawberries next to fields near Fresno to the pop-up stands offering carne asada tacos along Oakland thoroughfares. In Los Angeles alone, an estimated 10,000 street vendors sell food.

Until recently, vendors along Hollywood Boulevard were operating outside the law. And while that legal cloud has lifted, eking out a living remains a challenge. Cost-conscious tourists sometimes scoff at the prices, even if sellers struggle to break even. And while longtime street vendors respect and recognize the turf of other regulars, there are more sellers working in the area, and competition has increased.","“I knew I wanted to have my own business,” Mrs. Monrroy said on a recent weekday afternoon on Hollywood Boulevard, where her childhood wish has come true.

She spent summers getting ready to show cattle at the county fair. During the school year, she rushed home after class to feed the chickens on her family’s corn and soybean farm. Neither of her parents went to college, but they encouraged their daughter when she decided to go to Carleton, a liberal arts school a two-hour drive from their farm in Minnesota.

Despite being physically close to home, Ms. Lunz Trujillo was surprised by how foreign her upbringing seemed at the college. She was dismayed when she checked out the farm club and learned that its members wanted to brew kombucha, not milk cows. When an art history teacher asked students which famous paintings they’d seen in person, Ms. Lunz Trujillo stayed quiet, because she had never been to an art museum. This sense of cultural alienation molded her research when she became a political scientist: What is rural identity? How does it shape a person’s politics?

This year, Ms. Lunz Trujillo, now an assistant professor at the University of South Carolina, was reading a new, best-selling book that cited her research to explore those same questions. But this recognition didn’t bring the thrill she might have expected.","Kristin Lunz Trujillo grew up proud of her family’s way of life.

In the eyes of many of her colleagues, including the firm’s two other named partners, Ms. Kaplan’s poor treatment of other lawyers — ranging from micromanagement to vulgar insults and humiliating personal attacks — was impairing the boutique firm she had built, the people said.

The prime-time bout, organized by CNN and simulcast on more than a dozen networks, was easily the most-viewed moment of the 2024 presidential campaign, the sort of mass civic gathering that is increasingly rare in a choose-your-own-news era of media. And the figure released on Friday by Nielsen, which mostly measures traditional TV sets, did not include the likely millions more who watched on digital news sites and social media platforms.

The size of the TV audience — similar to that for an N.F.L. conference championship game — could be grim news for the Biden campaign, given the shaky and stumbling performance by the president, which set off panic in the upper echelons of the Democratic Party.

But viewership was also down 30 percent from the first Biden-Trump debate in September 2020, which notched more than 73 million viewers. Nielsen said Thursday’s matchup in Atlanta was the lowest-rated general-election debate since the final meeting of George W. Bush and John Kerry in 2004.","The numbers are in: 51.3 million Americans tuned in live to watch Thursday night’s televised debate between President Biden and former President Donald J. Trump.

People worried about bills, feeling overwhelmed about overspending or concerned about money management may expect a “money talk” to lead to an argument, so they avoid bringing up the topic, according to a report from researchers at Cornell University and Yale University, published this month in The Journal of Consumer Psychology. Yet prior research has found that communicating about money helps couples spend more responsibly and better manage their debt.

“They anticipate conflict, so they’re choosing not to have these conversations at all,” said Emily Garbinsky, associate professor of marketing and management communication at Cornell’s business school and one of the study’s authors.

Why is it so difficult for some people to talk about money with their partners in the first place?

Aja Evans, a financial therapist in New York, said people may feel ashamed that they are having money troubles. They may worry that talking about such things with their partner will hurt their relationship.

The Personal Consumption Expenditures index climbed 2.6 percent in May from a year earlier, matching what economists had forecast and down from 2.7 percent previously.

After stripping out volatile food and fuel prices to give a better sense of the inflation trend, a “core” price measure was also up 2.6 percent from a year earlier, down from 2.8 percent in the April reading. And on a monthly basis, inflation was especially mild, and prices did not climb on an overall basis.

The Fed is likely to watch the fresh inflation data closely as central bankers think about their next policy steps. Officials raised interest rates sharply starting in 2022 to hit the brakes on consumer and business demand, which in turn can help to slow price increases. But they have held borrowing costs steady at 5.3 percent since July as inflation has slowly come down, and have been contemplating when to begin lowering interest rates.","The Federal Reserve’s preferred inflation measure continued to cool as consumer spending grew only moderately, good news for central bankers who have been trying to weigh down demand and wrestle price increases under control.

After a bruising 90-minute debate that underscored President Biden’s single-biggest weakness — concern about his age — Democratic donors exchanged panicked texts and emails with one question: What’s Plan B?

The 81-year-old Biden’s halting, shaky performance against a confident (if sometimes misleading) showing by Donald Trump has set off alarm among Democrats with just seven weeks before the Democratic National Convention and four months before the November election.

Some party faithful who were suppressing their doubts about Biden are now privately lobbying Democratic leaders and scouring rule books to figure out how to change the presidential ticket.

“Disaster,” one unnamed Democratic donor told CNBC after the debate, reflecting the mood among the party’s moneyed class. Other reactions included “absolute train wreck” and “game over.” “Do we have time to put somebody else in there?” Mark Buell, a well-known Democratic donor, told The Times.","Post-debate panicAfter a bruising 90-minute debate that underscored President Biden’s single-biggest weakness — concern about his age — Democratic donors exchanged panicked texts and emails with one question: What’s Plan B?

The company, Kobayashi Pharmaceutical, in March had reported five deaths potentially linked to its CholesteHelp rice and red-yeast pills. Japanese government health officials said the supplement, which claimed to help reduce cholesterol, contained puberulic acid, a highly toxic compound that is a product of mold.

In response to the sudden surge in reported deaths, Health Minister Keizo Takemi said it was “extremely regrettable” that Kobayashi Pharmaceutical had not updated the ministry sooner. The company, which is based in Osaka, had not provided new information on deaths potentially linked to CholesteHelp since March.

Since then, Kobayashi Pharmaceutical has received reports that 1,656 people sought medical advice for CholesteHelp-related health concerns, and 289 people have been hospitalized, the company reported. CholesteHelp has been recalled in Japan and China, the only countries the supplement was sold in, according to a spokeswoman for Kobayashi Pharmaceutical.","A Japanese pharmaceutical company is investigating 80 deaths possibly linked to a yeast-containing supplement it sells in Japan, the country’s health ministry said Friday, in a shocking increase from an earlier revelation that is focusing attention on how supplements are regulated.

With the steady stream of conspicuous consumption on social media, it may be easier than ever to feel that you’re always on a beer budget, even if you can afford a bit of champagne.

And there’s a name for that: “money dysmorphia.”

This term, while not entirely new, has been ricocheting around the internet as a way to describe people’s often complicated relationship with money. It borrows from the term “body dysmorphic disorder,” a mental health condition that causes a person to obsess about a perceived physical flaw.

Money dysmorphia (not an actual diagnosis) refers to someone who is irrationally insecure about finances. That mind-set, financial planning experts say, can lead to money missteps including overspending or risky investments.","With the steady stream of conspicuous consumption on social media, it may be easier than ever to feel that you’re always on a beer budget, even if you can afford a bit of champagne.

He was 77.

The cause was cancer, said Brad Turell, a family spokesman.

Mr. Kellner was one of the most successful television executives of his generation. His knack for capturing young viewers — first men at Fox, then women at WB — lured viewers away from the Big Three networks that had ruled television for nearly 40 years.

Mr. Kellner believed that ABC, NBC and CBS were ignoring viewers under 35 and were hamstrung by middle-of-the-road taste. Rupert Murdoch, the owner of Fox Inc., and Barry Diller, its chairman, recruited Mr. Kellner from the television syndication business in 1986 and installed him as president of the Fox Broadcasting Company.

Its aspiration to be the first new TV network since ABC in 1948 was broadly derided. But from the debut in 1987 of its first series, the lowbrow family sitcom “Married … With Children,” which was shown on six Murdoch-owned stations and a string of independent ones that Mr. Kellner helped stitch together, the new network began stealing the Big Three’s audience.","Mr. Kellner was one of the most successful television executives of his generation.

The truth is that they spend most of their time trying to minimize risk.

It’s why theaters are clogged with vacuous sequels. It’s why so many Hollywood power players hide behind P.R. people. And it’s why all of the big movie studios and streaming services — and, in fact, most indie film companies — declined to distribute “The Apprentice,” a dramatized origin story about Donald J. Trump that the former president has called “malicious defamation” and showered with cease-and-desist letters.

But the movie business still has at least one wildcatter: Tom Ortenberg.

Mr. Ortenberg, 63, and his Briarcliff Entertainment are pushing to complete a deal to acquire “The Apprentice” for wide release in theaters in the United States in September or early October — close enough to the presidential election to bask in its heat, but far enough away to avoid final-stretch media overload. Briarcliff’s pursuit of the $16 million film was confirmed by five people involved with the sale process, who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss a private negotiation.

“Tom’s got more courage than most people in Hollywood combined,” said Stephen Galloway, the dean of Chapman University’s film school. “His interest in this kind of movie involves business, of course. He sees money to be made by leveraging millions of dollars in free publicity. But part of it is wanting to do his bit. He’s liberal and cares about social issues.”","The truth is that they spend most of their time trying to minimize risk.

Founded in 1979 and distinguished by its commitment to presenting work by living American writers, Second Stage said that its board had chosen Evan Cabnet as its next artistic director. Cabnet is currently the artistic director of LCT3, Lincoln Center Theater’s program for emerging writers, directors and designers. Cabnet will succeed Carole Rothman, one of the theater’s founders, who led the organization for 45 years and is stepping down in August.

Second Stage has a proud history of presenting acclaimed work, including the Pulitzer-winning shows “Between Riverside and Crazy,” “Water by the Spoonful” and “Next to Normal.” Its plays and musicals have won multiple other honors; most recently, the organization’s production of “Appropriate” won this year’s Tony Award for best play revival.

Second Stage owns Broadway’s smallest house, the 600-seat Hayes Theater. Like many nonprofit theaters, Second Stage has reduced its footprint since the pandemic — it let go of its Off Off Broadway space on the Upper West Side, and at the end of this year is letting go of its Off Broadway venue in Times Square, although it plans to continue to produce such work in other spaces, starting next spring at the Pershing Square Signature Center. The organization currently has 47 staffers and an annual budget of $27 million; this season it is planning to stage two Broadway shows, two Off Broadway shows and a Next Stage Festival for early-career work.","Second Stage Theater, one of the four nonprofit organizations with Broadway houses, on Thursday named a new artistic director as the sector braces for a wave of leadership turnover.

New York Times,https://www.nytimes.com/2024/06/27/business/dealbook/biden-trump-debate-cheat-sheet.html,2024-06-27,11:56:45 UTC,A Debate Cheat Sheet for Business,"Talking points

All eyes will be on CNN at 9 p.m. Eastern, when President Biden and Donald Trump face off in their first debate since 2020. Among the keenest watchers will be executives and investors looking for signs about how the candidates might handle the economy and business in a second term.

There will be plenty to scrutinize in the 90-minute, audience-free debate, including what the candidates say and how they say it. Here’s what we will be looking out for. (And, for a lighter take, check out our debate “bingo card” further below.)

The economy is the big question. Various measures show strong growth under Biden, but many voters feel differently. What will Biden and Trump say about some of the key issues?

Inflation: This is clearly a challenge for the president, as Americans complain about what they’re paying in the grocery store, at the pump and on their rent. Biden can say that price increases are slowing down, and will most likely emphasize his administration’s efforts to crack down on “corporate greed,” like taking on so-called junk fees. Trump will probably stress how good things were when he took office in 2017 — an economy many Americans want back.

Taxes: Biden’s proposals for higher corporate taxes will hit profits: “It’s simple math,” David Bahnsen, the founder and chief investment officer of the Bahnsen Group, told DealBook. Many business leaders don’t like Biden’s plan to increase taxes on the wealthy, either. Trump will probably stress his desire to extend his 2017 tax cuts and lower the corporate rate to 20 percent. But questions about corporate earnings and the economy may eclipse those concerns.

Protectionism: Both candidates want to increase tariffs on Chinese goods, but Biden has been more targeted in how he has done it during his presidency. Trump has proposed significantly higher across-the-board levies, though it’s unclear how serious he is about it. Economists have warned that Trump’s potential approach could aggravate inflation and hurt the economy.

Markets: The S&P 500 set 31 records this year; investors will hope neither party messes with that momentum. In Thursday night’s debate, “markets probably care more about presentation than policy pledges,” Paul Donovan, an economist at UBS, wrote in a client note. Biden may have a slight edge, he added, since investors would prefer keeping “some continuity.”

Other issues will probably feature prominently. Biden will most likely raise abortion rights, a topic that has helped Democrats win in recent elections. Trump will almost certainly speak a lot about immigration, perhaps his most potent issue — and one that many, including Elon Musk, say is a failure of Biden’s.

The intangibles will matter. Executives told DealBook that C.E.O.s will be paying attention to how Biden and Trump perform:

For Biden, 81, an important issue for business leaders and many voters is whether he is still fit to serve. A sharp, forceful performance could go a ways in quieting any concerns.

For Trump, 78, competence is a question as well. But his demeanor will also be under scrutiny, especially if he comes across as overly abrasive or erratic. Some executives said their feelings would come down to whether they can stomach another four years of a Trump presidency.

There’s also the show around the show. Trump has suggested that his potential running mate would be in Atlanta for the debate. The Times reports that his list is narrowing, with Senator J.D. Vance of Ohio, Gov. Doug Burgum of North Dakota and Senator Marco Rubio of Florida being of particular interest.","Talking pointsAll eyes will be on CNN at 9 p.m. Eastern, when President Biden and Donald Trump face off in their first debate since 2020.

Addressing reporters at a company factory in Renton, Wash., Elizabeth Lund, a Boeing executive, provided new details on Tuesday about how the plane involved in the incident left the plant apparently without four critical bolts that secured the panel, known as a door plug, in place.

Boeing said the information was not for release until Thursday morning, under a common kind of agreement that allowed the attending reporters time to process the detailed briefing.

But the National Transportation Safety Board became aware of the remarks at the briefing and rebuked the company hours before articles on the remarks were published. It said that Boeing improperly shared investigative information and speculated about the cause of the incident, adding that the company had “blatantly violated” the agency’s rules surrounding active investigations. The agency said it would provide details about that violation to the Justice Department, which is investigating the January flight.","Boeing drew fresh criticism from a federal regulator on Thursday over disclosures about the continuing investigation into a harrowing January flight during which one of the company’s 737 Max planes lost a panel, exposing passengers to howling winds at an altitude of about 16,000 feet.

Most Read from Bloomberg

The move came as Microsoft shares rose to a fresh record, bringing their total gain this year to 21%. The company, through its partnership with OpenAI, has been one of the biggest beneficiaries of the artificial intelligence rally that has powered the US stock market higher.

More than 90% of Ballmer’s $157.2 billion net worth is in Microsoft shares, according to the Bloomberg Billionaires Index. Gates, meanwhile, has diversified his $156.7 billion fortune: About half his wealth is held through Cascade Investment, which was created with the proceeds of Microsoft stock sales and dividends. He also owns a $21 billion stake in waste-management company Republic Services Inc. through Cascade.

Gates, 68, has been slowly reducing his fortune through philanthropy. Along with his ex-wife Melinda French Gates and his friend Warren Buffett, Gates has funneled billions of dollars of his personal money to build up the $75 billion Gates Foundation, one of the biggest charitable organizations in the world.

Since they started the foundation more than two decades ago, Gates and his former wife have given almost $60 billion from their personal fortunes. French Gates recently stepped down as co-chair of the foundation and received $12.5 billion to use for her own charitable purposes.

In 2010, Gates, French Gates and Buffett also founded the Giving Pledge, an organization that encourages the world’s richest people to give away the majority of their fortunes in their lifetimes or their wills. Ballmer, 68, who has not signed the Giving Pledge, has his own philanthropic work but nowhere on the scale of Gates.

Gates founded Microsoft with his friend Paul Allen in 1975 and led it until 2000, when Ballmer — one of the company’s earliest employees — replaced him as CEO. Ballmer retired in 2014 and became Microsoft’s largest shareholder that same year. He bought the NBA’s Los Angeles Clippers for $2 billion in 2014, an investment that is estimated to be worth $4.6 billion today.

During the 2023 Daily Journal shareholder meeting, Munger responded to a question from CNBC's Becky Quick about the trend of large companies, including Meta, opting for self-insurance against various liabilities. Quickly inquired about the potential systemic issues this trend could cause and sought Munger's thoughts.

Don't Miss:

Are you rich? Here’s what Americans think you need to be considered wealthy.

Warren Buffett once said, ""If you don't find a way to make money while you sleep, you will work until you die."" Here's how you can collect passive rental income without being a landlord.

Known for his straightforward approach, Munger shared his personal philosophy on self-insurance. He said, ""In my own life, I'm a big self-insurer and so is Warren. It's ridiculous to carry fire insurance on my houses because I can so easily rebuild a house that would burn down. So why would I want to bother fooling around with the claims process and all kinds of things?""

He emphasized the practicality of self-insuring for those who can afford it, noting, ""If insurance, you should insure against things you can't afford to pay for yourself. But if you can afford to take the bumps, you know, some unusual expense coming along doesn't really hurt you that much. Why would you want to fool around with some insurance company? If your house burned down, I would just write a check and rebuild it.""

Munger argued that all intelligent people are self-insured. He then clarified, maybe not ""all,"" but said, ""All intelligent people should do it my way,"" highlighting the waste and fraud often associated with traditional insurance. ""There should be way more self-insurance in life. There's a lot of waste you're paying when you buy insurance for the other fellow's frauds, and there's a lot of fraud in life."" He explained that if you can afford to take the risk yourself, you should, but there is a risk involved.

It may be easy for a Munger to rebuild a home, considering his net worth was $2.6 billion during the interview. However, for the average person, this would be an extreme hardship. There is also the liability factor involved if something were to occur on your property, causing injury to another.

Trending: Elon Musk and Jeff Bezos are bullish on one city that could dethrone New York and become the new financial capital of the US. Investing in its booming real estate market has never been more accessible.

Berkshire Hathaway, the conglomerate where Munger served as vice chairman, has substantial interests in the insurance industry. The company owns several major insurance subsidiaries, including GEICO, Berkshire Hathaway Reinsurance Group, and Berkshire Hathaway Primary Group. These insurance operations have been a core part of Berkshire Hathaway's financial success, making Munger's advice particularly notable given the company's deep involvement in the sector.

Story continues

Despite his role at Berkshire Hathaway, a company deeply invested in the insurance industry, Munger maintained his candid stance. ""I'd rather tell it the way it is and tell it in a way that helps Berkshire. I'm not going to tell it differently than I think it really is just because it's better for Berkshire. Even though it's bad for Berkshire, I want to tell you, if you can afford to self-insure, self-insure.""

Munger's advice comes when a growing number of American homeowners opt to go without insurance, not because they can afford to self-insure like Munger, but due to rising costs. A recent study by the Insurance Information Institute found that 12% of Americans no longer have home insurance, up from 5% in 2019. This surge in uninsured homeowners is the highest the industry has seen, driven by the rising coverage costs.

Self-insurance may offer savings and simplicity, but it carries significant risks. For many, it might not be a viable option without a thorough understanding of their financial situation. Consulting a financial advisor can help assess whether self-insurance is feasible and advisable.

(Reuters) -BlackRock has launched a 'buffer' exchange-traded fund that seeks to offer a 100% downside hedge to risk-shy investors looking to tap the equity markets, the world's largest asset manager said on Monday.

So-called buffer or risk-managed ETFs help maximize returns from an asset for investors and simultaneously provide downside protection over a specific period.

The novel product will likely appeal to investors who are hoping to ride a rally in the stock markets as they continue to trade near record highs, but are concerned that a slowing economy and higher-for-longer interest rates can together hurt sentiment going forward.

Buffer ETFs also typically see lower redemption requests during times of heavy market volatility.

""BlackRock is not early - and actually is a little late - to the buffered ETF game, but with (the company's) size, reach, and marketing machine, it has a fair chance of catching up with and surpassing earlier market entrants,"" said Michael Ashley Schulman, partner and CIO at Running Point Capital Advisors.

""Launching buffered ETFs now, when the market is near all-time highs and many investors are nervous - especially with inflation, upcoming elections, and expanding debt - could be especially fortuitous for them,"" he added.

The iShares Large Cap Max Buffer Jun ETF started trading on Monday under the ticker symbol 'MAXJ'.

The asset manager said the ETF will track the returns of the benchmark S&P 500 using options with an upside cap, while providing a 100% hedge to all downside for roughly a year.

""With record levels of cash sitting on the sidelines, many investors are looking for tools to help navigate market volatility before they step back into the market,"" said Rachel Aguirre, head of U.S. iShares product, BlackRock.

BlackRock added that it now manages $25 billion in assets under management across more than 40 active ETFs in the United States, as of June 30.

The aggressive growth investor who's also the co-founder, CEO, and ace stock picker at Ark Invest enjoys swinging the fences. She's also not afraid to go for the safe single, binge-buying some of her favorite holdings over and over again.

She publishes Ark Invest's transactions at the end of every market day. Something out of the ordinary happened on Friday night, as she announced her purchases from earlier in the day. PagerDuty (NYSE: PD) was one of the six existing positions that she added to on Friday. More importantly, she bought shares of the cloud-based provider of enterprise analytics and uptime monitoring solutions every single trading day in June. She obviously likes PagerDuty right now. Should you? Let's take a closer look.

Reporting for duty

Enterprise software companies are all about making businesses more efficient, and that's what PagerDuty's growing suite of offerings aims to accomplish. From automation tools that help increase task completion speeds and lower support costs to its incident management platform that allows clients to navigate through hiccups and come out of disruptions even smarter, PagerDuty's ambitious isn't on trial.

Growth has been the problem, particularly given its recent run of slowing top-line gains. Year-over-year revenue growth has decelerated for seven consecutive financial reports, from a starting point of 34% down to just 8% nearly two years later.

Q2 2023: 34%

Q3 2023: 31%

Q4 2023: 29%

Q1 2024: 21%

Q2 2024: 19%

Q3 2024: 15%

Q4 2024: 10%

Q1 2025: 8%

PagerDuty's dollar-based net retention rate has disintegrated from 116% to 106% over the past year, and its paid customers count has stalled around 15,100 in that time. The bottom line has also been problematic. It has never turned a profit on a reported basis, and analysts don't see that changing anytime soon. It did announce a small round of layoffs earlier this year, but it remains to be seen if the cost controls will pay off without sacrificing a potential return to top-line growth.

Knocking on Wood

Cathie Wood naturally has a more upbeat read on PagerDuty than the downward sloping fundamentals. She has been buying a piece of PagerDuty every trading day since May 31. Despite the recent daily trickle of purchases, it remains one of the smallest positions across the combined holdings of Ark Invest's exchange-traded funds.

She's not the only one who was buying. Shares of PagerDuty soared 21% last month.

There are some reasons to be upbeat about PagerDuty's near-term prospects. For starters, despite the single-digit revenue growth that PagerDuty posted in its latest quarter, Wall Street pros see it returning to double-digit revenue gains for the entire fiscal year and accelerating in each of the next two years.

Story continues

Profitability on an adjusted basis is also expected to climb 14% next year and another 24% in fiscal 2027. This prices PagerDuty stock at 23 times that fiscal year's adjusted earnings, but it has also posted double-digit percentage beats in each of the past four reports.

The naysayers are still plentiful, and that's not necessarily a bad thing. Nearly 12% of PagerDuty's shares are currently being sold short, approaching the all-time high it notched earlier this year. In the right environment, even a modest bullish catalyst can send the boo-birds scrambling for cover, and the short squeeze would theoretically push the stock higher.

Sentiment could be turning after a buoyant June. Chad Bennett at Craig-Hallum upgraded the stock last week, rallying around the potential for revenue gains to accelerate after bottoming out in the fiscal first quarter. His new $30 price target implies another 31% of upside in the shares. A reignited PagerDuty should result in either the resumption of customer growth or a reversal in the retreat of its dollar-based net retention rate. In an ideal world it would be a little bit of both leading the charge, and PagerDuty reaching reported profitability sooner than expected. For now, a once out-of-favor software-as-a-service company -- or SaaS stock -- is starting to court believers. Wood seems to have the right idea when it comes to buying PagerDuty this summer.

Part of retirement planning includes determining how much to save and invest so you can enjoy the type of lifestyle you desire. Setting your savings target by age can be a good way to organize your strategy and gauge how to track progress with your goals. You might also be interested in how much the typical retiree has saved at age 65, 70 and beyond. In this article, we’re going to focus on how much the average person has saved and possibly should have saved at the age of 70. Keep in mind, though, that your situation is still completely unique to what your goals are. You may want to work with a financial advisor to make sure your savings goals are in line with where you need to be later on.

How Much Does the Average 70-Year-Old Have in Savings?

According to data from the Federal Reserve’s most recent Survey of Consumer Finances, the average 65 to 74-year-old has a little over $426,000 saved. That’s money that’s specifically set aside in retirement accounts, including 401(k) plans and IRAs.

The Federal Reserve also measures median and mean (average) savings across other types of financial assets. According to the data, the average 70-year-old has approximately:

$60,000 in transaction accounts (including checking and savings)

$127,000 in certificate of deposit (CD) accounts

$17,000 in savings bonds

$43,000 in cash value life insurance

In terms of overall trends, the numbers show an increase over the previous Survey of Consumer Finances. According to that survey, the average 65 to 75-year-old had $381,000 saved for retirement in 2016. That figure, however, was well below the $486,000 70-year-olds had saved on average in 2013.

Whether the Survey of Consumer Finances for 2022 shows an uptick in savings or a decline remains to be seen. While Social Security benefits have seen several cost-of-living increases since the last survey was completed, persistently high inflation has put more pressure on Americans’ spending power. The survey may show that 70-year-olds have less in retirement savings if they’re spending more to compensate for higher prices.

If you’re ready to be matched with local advisors that can help you achieve your financial goals, get started now .

How Much Should a 70-Year-Old Have in Savings?

Financial experts generally recommend saving anywhere from $1 million to $2 million for retirement. If you consider an average retirement savings of $426,000 for those in the 65 to 74-year-old range, the numbers obviously don’t match up.

The amount a 70-year-old should save for retirement can depend on several things, including:

Story continues

Desired retirement lifestyle

When they apply for Social Security benefits

Other sources of retirement income, such as a 401(k), IRA, pension or annuity

Other savings, including taxable brokerage accounts, savings accounts and CDs

Overall health and life expectancy

The more money you anticipate spending to cover your cost of living in retirement, the more you’ll typically need to save. Social Security benefits are a staple part of many retirees’ income picture, but those payments may only go so far. Pensions, meanwhile, are becoming more of a rarity as employers opt for defined contribution plans instead.

Long-term care can put a strain on retiree budgets and increase the amount of money you need to save. Medicare doesn’t cover long-term care though Medicaid does. But to qualify for Medicaid, you’ll typically need to spend down your assets. Purchasing long-term care insurance can be a workaround so you’re not at risk of draining your savings.

What Is a Good Net Worth at 70?

how much does the average 70-year-old have in savings

Net worth is a measure of your assets vs. your liabilities. In other words, it’s the difference between what you own and what you owe.

The average net worth of Americans aged 65 to 74 hovers around $1.2 million. The median net worth is lower, at $164,000. The typical 70-year-old has around $105,000 in debt, including mortgages, home equity loans, credit cards and student loans, as measured by the Fed’s data.

What constitutes a good net worth is situation-specific and largely linked to your retirement goals. There are different rules of thumb you can apply to come up with an ideal net worth calculation. For example, one rule suggests having a net worth at 70 that’s equivalent to 20 times your annual expenses.

If you spend $100,000 a year to live in retirement, you should have a net worth of at least $2 million. On the other hand, if you only spend $40,000 on living expenses, then your target net worth would be much lower, at $800,000.

Is Retiring at 70 a Good Idea?

Whether it makes sense to retire at 70 can depend on your finances and what you envision for your dream retirement. When choosing a retirement age, it’s helpful to consider:

When you’ll really need to take Social Security benefits

Whether you’ll still work in a part-time capacity after retiring

How long you plan to live in retirement

Your desired savings goal and current savings rate

If you can delay taking Social Security benefits until age 70, that can boost your benefit amount. You’ll be eligible to collect 132% of your benefit amount by waiting longer to apply.

You can also continue saving and investing for retirement if you’re working longer. For example, you can continue maxing out your 401(k) each year, or at the very least, contribute enough to get your full employer match. You can also funnel money into an IRA for supplemental savings.

Retiring at 70 means you’ll have a two-year gap before you’ll need to begin taking required minimum distributions (RMDs) from a traditional 401(k). You’ll also need to take RMDs if you have a Roth 401(k), but Roth IRAs are exempt from this rule.

Within that window, you might decide to convert your traditional IRA to a Roth account. Doing so can mean a higher tax bill in the year of the conversion since you’re required to pay taxes on your traditional IRA earnings. But moving forward, you’d be able to take tax-free distributions from your Roth IRA.

The Bottom Line

how much does the average 70-year-old have in savings

How much does the average 70-year-old have in savings? Just shy of $500,000, according to the Federal Reserve. The better question, however, may be whether that’s enough for a 70-year-old to live on in retirement so that you can align your budget accordingly. With no end to higher inflation in sight, retiring on $500,000 may not be realistic for everyone. The good news is that the younger you are, the more time you have to plan, save and invest for the future.

Retirement Planning Tips

Consider talking to your financial advisor about the pros and cons of retiring at 70 and what your personal timeline for retirement should look like. If you don’t have a financial advisor yet, finding one doesn’t have to be hard. SmartAsset’s free tool matches you with up to three financial advisors who serve your area, and you can interview your advisor matches at no cost to decide which one is right for you. If you’re ready to find an advisor who can help you achieve your financial goals, get started now.

Delaying Social Security benefits could help you to collect more money in retirement. Taking benefits early, however, could reduce your monthly payment amount. The earliest you can begin taking Social Security is age 62 but it may benefit you to wait until at least your full retirement age to apply. Also, keep in mind that if you do decide to take Social Security early and you continue to work, your benefit amount may be reduced even further. Understanding how to maximize Social Security benefits can help you get the most money possible.

Keep an emergency fund on hand in case you run into unexpected expenses. An emergency fund should be liquid — in an account that isn't at risk of significant fluctuation like the stock market. The tradeoff is that the value of liquid cash can be eroded by inflation. But a high-interest account allows you to earn compound interest. Compare savings accounts from these banks.

Yahoo Finance,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/3-warren-buffett-stocks-screaming-092100428.html,2024-07-01,09:21:00 UTC,3 Warren Buffett Stocks That Are Screaming Buys for the Second Half of 2024 (and Beyond),"If you've ever wondered why Berkshire Hathaway (NYSE: BRK.A)(NYSE: BRK.B) CEO Warren Buffett draws in the neighborhood of 40,000 investors to his company's shareholder meeting each year, look no further than his track record. Since taking over the CEO role in the mid-1960s, the ""Oracle of Omaha"" has overseen a nearly 4,964,000% return in his company's Class A shares (BRK.A), which compares quite favorably to the roughly 36,000% total return, including dividends paid, for the broad-based S&P 500 over the same span.

For nearly six decades, Buffett and his top-notch investment team have had a knack for picking out time-tested bargains hiding in plain sight.

At the moment, Berkshire has stakes in 44 stocks and two exchange-traded funds spanning $388 billion of invested assets. But among these holdings are three Warren Buffett stocks that represent screaming buys for the second half of 2024, and likely well beyond.

Amazon

The first Warren Buffett stock that stands out for all the right reasons for the second half of 2024 and well beyond is e-commerce leader Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN).

The knock against Amazon has always been its relatively ""expensive"" valuation, at least when using traditional fundamental metrics, such as the price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio. While the time-tested P/E ratio works great when attempting to value mature businesses, this go-to metric tends to come up short when analyzing fast-growing companies that are regularly reinvesting their cash flow back into their operations.

Chances are that you're familiar with Amazon because of its superior e-commerce platform. In 2023, Amazon is estimated to have garnered a nearly 38% share of U.S. online retail sales. While this would, in theory, expose the company to weakness if the U.S. or global economy were to fall into a recession, the important thing to recognize about Amazon is that its operating cash flow and income almost exclusively originate from its faster-growing ancillary operations.

For investors, nothing is more important than Amazon Web Services (AWS). AWS is the world's leading cloud infrastructure service platform, and it recently surpassed $100 billion in annualized run-rate sales. What's noteworthy about this psychological run-rate revenue milestone is that businesses are still in the relatively early stages of ramping up their cloud-service spending. Since cloud-service margins are considerably juicier than the margins associated with online retail sales, AWS is typically responsible for 50% to 100% of Amazon's operating income.

Story continues

Beyond AWS, Amazon is also relying on advertising services and subscription services to do some heavy lifting. Amazon draws around 2.5 billion unique visitors to its site each month, which is more than eyeballs enough to attract advertisers.

Meanwhile, the company surpassed 200 million global Prime subscribers in April 2021 and has likely added to this total as its content library and e-commerce platform have grown. Like AWS, advertising services and subscription services offer sustained double-digit sales growth.

Despite recently hitting a new all-time high, Amazon is historically cheap relative to cash flow projections. Throughout the 2010s, investors regularly paid 23 to 37 times year-end cash flow to own shares of Amazon. You can buy shares right now for about 13 times estimated cash flow per share in 2025.

Chevron

A second no-brainer Warren Buffett stock that's begging to be bought for the second half of 2024 (and beyond) is global energy giant Chevron (NYSE: CVX).

The clearest headwind current and prospective Chevron shareholders have to contend with is the prospect of a recession taking shape in the U.S. or abroad. Oil and gas stocks tend to ebb-and-flow with the spot price of crude oil and natural gas. During periods of economic weakness, it's not uncommon for commodity-driven companies to struggle.

The good news for Chevron is that macro factors are decisively working in its favor. Even with select predictive indicators cautioning of a coming recession -- e.g., the first drop off in U.S. M2 money supply since the Great Depression -- the U.S. economy has remained resilient.

To add to this point, the unprecedented demand uncertainty associated with the COVID-19 pandemic led global energy majors (including Chevron) to scale back their capital expenditures (capex) for a good three years. Even with capex ramping back up, the global supply of crude oil has been constrained. When the supply of an in-demand good is tight, it tends to have a positive effect on the spot price of that good. In simpler terms, it's buoying the price of oil, which in turn is generating more operating cash flow for Chevron's drilling segment.

Perhaps one of the biggest catalysts for the second half of 2024 and into 2025 is Chevron's pending deal to acquire Hess in an all-share transaction valued at $53 billion. If this buyout gets the green light from regulators, Chevron is going to add 465,000 net acres in the oil-rich Bakken Shale, as well as meaningfully increase its oil-equivalent exposure in Guyana. If the price of oil remains elevated, it makes this deal all the sweeter.

Although drilling is where Chevron derives its best margins, don't overlook that it's also an integrated operator. The company's transmission pipelines, refineries, and chemical plants act as a hedge in the event that the spot price of crude oil declines. The steady operating cash flow from these ancillary operating segments has played a key role in Chevron being able to increase its base annual dividend for 37 consecutive years.

The icing on the cake is that Chevron's stock is, also, historically inexpensive. Shares can be grabbed right now for less than 11 times forward-year earnings, which represents a 23% discount to its average forward-year multiple over the trailing-five-year period.

Coca-Cola

The third Warren Buffett stock that's a screaming buy for the second half of 2024, and likely well beyond, is beverage behemoth Coca-Cola (NYSE: KO).

Whereas an economic downturn is arguably the biggest enemy for Amazon and Chevron, the prospect of above-average inflation is typically viewed as the most front-and-center headwind for consumer staples companies. When the price of goods and services is rising at an above-average rate, there's always a concern that consumers may be forced to pare back their spending.

The good news for Coca-Cola is that it provides a basic necessity product. Regardless of what's happening with the U.S. economy or Wall Street, consumers are still going to purchase beverages. Given the company's strong branding, Coca-Cola rarely has any trouble increasing its prices to offset rising expenses.

Speaking of strong branding, Coca-Cola was named the ""most-chosen brand"" by consumers for a 12th straight year in Kantar's latest ""Brand Footprint"" report. This dominance is a reflection of Coca-Cola's top-tier marketing campaign, which involves using digital channels and artificial intelligence (AI) to reach younger audiences, while leaning on more than a century of history and well-known brand ambassadors to connect with its mature consumers.

From an operating perspective, Coca-Cola is firing on all cylinders. Although it's not the growth story it once was, it has the right puzzle pieces in place to deliver consistent mid-single-digit sales and earnings growth. It has more than two dozen brands generating at least $1 billion in annual sales, and is operating in all but three countries (Cuba, North Korea, and Russia). This gives Coca-Cola a steady stream of predictable cash flow in developed countries, and needle-moving organic growth potential in emerging markets.

Coca-Cola is also known for its top-tier capital-return program. In February, the company increased its quarterly dividend by 5.4%, which marked the 62nd consecutive year it's lifted its payout. Berkshire Hathaway is generating a roughly 60% annual yield relative to its cost basis in Coca-Cola stock.

Lastly -- and to stay on theme -- the valuation makes sense. Coca-Cola's forward P/E ratio of 21 is roughly 10% below its average forward-year earnings multiple over the last five years.

Yahoo Finance,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/why-nextera-energy-partners-plunged-204818657.html,2024-07-01,20:48:18 UTC,Why NextEra Energy Partners Plunged Today,"Shares of NextEra Energy Partners (NYSE: NEP) fell on Monday, down 8.7% in today's trading.

The master limited partnership (MLP) focused on buying and holding renewable energy projects from parent utility NextEra Energy (NYSE: NEE) was down after a Wall Street analyst downgraded the stock and lowered his price target.

Why? A potential cut to the company's 13.8% dividend could be in the cards.

RBC forecasts a dividend cut for NextEra

In his note today, RBC Capital analyst Shelby Tucker lowered his rating on NextEra Partners from outperform to market perform, cutting his price target from $38 to $30.

Tucker now believes that there aren't enough lower-cost wind repowering opportunities to grow NextEra's earnings to its 5% to 8% target, and that the company may have trouble keeping the dividend this high while also paying off billions of looming convertible equity portfolio financing (CEPF) maturities. These types of project financings enabled NextEra to fund projects in a relatively low-cost and flexible manner, but NEP's CEPF notes were sold when interest rates were much lower. After 2026, there are $3.7 billion of looming maturities that will need to be paid off.

While NextEra has time and options to pay off these liabilities, the increased cost of capital since the CEPFs were sold means that it will be expensive for NextEra to refinance. Thus, while management had contemplated private financings, Tucker thinks the lingering higher interest rate environment will necessitate a cut to the company's distribution. Tucker suspects a 50% cut could be in the cards, and may even be prudent. That would take care of the CEPF financing while leaving the company free from having to take on expensive debt or issue equity. Issuing equity would be painful, with the stock down 68% from its all-time highs.

Be wary of MLPs that pay out high dividends

Investors may have been tempted to buy NextEra in the past due to its ample and growing dividend. But the problem with these MLP models is that when interest rate or economic worries pop up and the stock goes down, the company can no longer issue stock to grow. Thus, the model becomes ""stuck"" and can result in painful dilution or cuts to what once looked like a mouth-watering dividend yield. It looks like that is what's happening with NEP today.

Most Read from Bloomberg

In a proposed class action filed Friday in Brooklyn, New York, federal court, GameStop shareholder Martin Radev sued Gill for securities fraud, claiming he was seeking to manipulate the stock for his own gain. In a court filing late Monday afternoon, Radev said he was voluntarily dismissing the lawsuit.

It’s unclear why Radev dropped the suit, and his lawyers didn’t immediately respond to requests for comment. The dismissal was without prejudice, meaning he is free to file the suit again.

Gill also didn’t respond to an email seeking comment.

One of the public faces of the 2021 meme-stock craze, Gill amassed more than a million followers across his “Roaring Kitty” YouTube channel and “DeepF***ingValue” Reddit page. He reemerged in May and again began posting about Gamestop on X, the social media platform formerly known as Twitter.

The suit alleged that Gill acquired 120,000 call options in GameStop before he began posting about the company in May. The stock, which had been trading around $17 just before Gill began to post, soared to $48.75 on May 14.

On June 2, he revealed that he owned 5 million shares of GameStop and 120,000 call options that were set to expire on June 21. By June 13, Gill’s holdings had risen to more than 9 million shares of GameStop with no outstanding call options.

Gill “quietly sold and/or exercised (i.e., dumped) all 120,000 of his GameStop call options for a large profit, seemingly to increase his own stake in GameStop stock by over 4 million shares,” Radev said in the suit.

GameStop shares have since fallen, though they’re still higher than they were before Gill’s posts. They closed at around $23 on Monday afternoon.

GameStop’s recent rise was less pronounced than during the meme-stock frenzy. The company surged more than 1,700% during one stretch in January 2021, and the stock’s stratospheric rise appeared to pit scrappy individual investors against sophisticated hedge funds that were heavily shorting the troubled mall retailer.

On Monday, Chewy Inc. shares spiked as much as 10% after Gill disclosed a 6.6% passive stake in the online pet food and product retailer.

Story continues

The filing with the US Securities and Exchange Commission came days after the investor posted a photo with a puppy without any comment on X. The post briefly sent the pet food retailer to a one-year high on Thursday.

The case is Radev v. Gill, 24-cv-04608, US District Court, Eastern District of New York.

Cathie Wood's Ark Invest has destroyed $14 billion in wealth over the past decade.

A Morningstar analysis found that Ark Invest topped the list of wealth destroyers among other investment companies.

""These funds managed to lose value for shareholders even during a generally bullish market,"" Morningstar said.

Cathie Wood's Ark Invest has destroyed an estimated $14.3 billion in wealth over the past decade, according to a recent Morningstar analysis.

Ark Invest was all the rage in 2020 and 2021, when its concentrated bets on highly speculative technology companies paid off in a big way thanks to low interest rates and a boom in risk appetite among retail investors.

Ark's flagship innovation ETF, ARKK, soared nearly 150% in 2020, and that massive outperformance helped drive a surge of inflows into its funds right near its peak.

The firm attracted nearly $30 billion in assets in 2020 and 2021, which were then decimated during the 2022 bear market when its flagship fund plunged 67%.

The ARKK ETF destroyed $7.1 billion in wealth, while its healthcare-focused ARK Genomic ETF destroyed $4.2 billion in wealth, according to Morningstar.

Across all fund families that have destroyed wealth over the past decade, Ark Invest topped the list — and its losses were more than double the next firm on the list.

What's striking is that Ark's massive wealth destruction occurred during a favorable time for the stock market.

""These funds managed to lose value for shareholders even during a generally bullish market,"" Morningstar analyst Amy Arnott said.

The ARKK ETF has generated a total positive return of 121.8% since its inception in 2014, which is less than half the Nasdaq 100's gain of 329.5% over the same time period. Meanwhile, the ARKK ETF is still down 71% from its record high.

Despite the massive wealth destruction, ARK Invest as a business is doing just fine. The investment company still has more than $13 billion in assets across its suite of ETFs, signaling that not all investors have abandoned Wood's investment strategy.

But in an investment world that is shifting to valuing profits over growth, it is unclear when Ark Invest's investment strategy might pay off again for investors.

The firm's top holdings currently include Coinbase, Tesla, Roku, and Zoom Video, all of which have had a rough start to 2024.

""The biggest value destroyers in the fund industry illustrate that there's no guarantee of success, even during a generally favorable market environment. They also provide a valuable case study in how not to invest,"" Arnott said.

The stock has soared more than 750% as of this writing, driven higher by the potential implications of generative artificial intelligence (AI). The ability to streamline time-consuming tasks and automate routine processes promises to increase productivity and could unleash a wave of greater profits for businesses that adopt this cutting-edge technology.

Nvidia's graphics processing units (GPUs) are the gold standard and provide the computational horsepower necessary for AI processing. This has let loose a tidal wave of demand for the company's high-end processors, sending its business and financial results surging, resulting in its recent 10-for-1 stock split.

While some investors fear the easy money has been made, others believe the best is yet to come. One analyst suggests Nvidia has a killer advantage that will help it stay ahead of the competition and unleash a ""cash gusher"" that will profit shareholders.

Let's see if the analyst's argument holds water and what it means for investors.

A long track record of success

To understand the source of this ""cash gusher,"" it helps to take a step back to see how Nvidia got to where it is today.

Nvidia's state-of-the-art processors have long been the industry standard for serious gamers. The company controlled 88% of the discrete desktop GPU market in the first quarter, according to data compiled by Jon Peddie Research.

However, Nvidia adapted that same technology to zip data through the ether, becoming the go-to processor for data centers. Estimates suggest the company controls as much as 92% of the data center GPU market, according to IoT Analytics. Nvidia is also the undisputed leader in processing machine learning -- an established branch of AI -- with an estimated 95% of that market, according to data supplied by New Street Research.

Since much of generative AI processing occurs in the cloud and data centers, Nvidia has cemented its position as the leader. The company is set to release its Blackwell family of processors later this year, and CEO Jensen Huang has said, ""The Blackwell Architecture platform will likely be the most successful product in our history."" If that's the case, and I believe that it is, the best could be yet to come.

Furthermore, while the popular narrative says the competition is coming for Nvidia, thus far -- despite years of opportunity -- no serious competitor has emerged.

A ""cash gusher""

Melius Research analyst Ben Reitzes believes Nvidia has one killer advantage that some investors may be overlooking, one that will keep the company on the leading edge of technology. Nvidia provides not only the chips that are tailor-made for AI but also the integrated software that eeks every last ounce of performance from these AI-centric processors. This ""full stack"" approach, or the marrying of hardware and software, provides Nvidia with a key advantage that will be hard for rivals to match, particularly given the company's long track record of leadership in the field.

Story continues

""What they did is they built a computing language and an ecosystem that allows you to monetize AI, and obviously, they're killing it,"" Reitzes said.

The analyst goes on to note that the cadence of Nvidia's research and development (R&D) makes it hard for competitors to keep up. The company recently increased its already relentless pace of innovation, as CEO Jensen Huang said the company is now ""on a one-year rhythm,"" releasing new processors every year instead of every two years. ""They're running 150 miles an hour while everyone else is running 100. It's going to be hard to catch these guys,"" Reitzes said.

As a result of the accelerating adoption of AI and Nvidia's dominant position, it's estimated the company will generate $270 billion in cash in the coming three years, which could unleash a wave of returns to shareholders in the form of stock buybacks and higher dividend payments.

The analyst notes that even with higher R&D spending, the influx of cash will far outweigh any potential uses, suggesting the majority will be returned to shareholders.

Investors are already seeing evidence of that shift. Late last year, Nvidia announced a new $25 billion share repurchase plan. Furthermore, in conjunction with its stock split announcement in May, the company increased its dividend payment by 150%. That said, Nvidia is currently using less than 1% of profits to fund the dividend, and even at its higher rate, the yield is a paltry 0.03%.

This illustrates that there's still ample opportunity for Nvidia to return cash to shareholders, and with the ongoing tsunami of AI adoption, the company will have an increasing amount of resources to do just that. Furthermore, given its killer advantage, its unlikely a rival will take Nvidia's crown, at least not anytime soon.

BYD sold 426,039 EVs in the April-June quarter, according to Reuters' calculations based on its monthly sales reports. That's around 12,000 vehicles fewer than Tesla's vehicle deliveries estimated for the second quarter.

BYD and Autotorino store in Milan. (Reuters)

Tesla is expected to report a 6% drop in April-June quarter vehicle deliveries on Tuesday, the first time the U.S. firm is set to post two straight quarters of decline, as it deals with stiff competition in China and slow demand due to a lack of affordable new models.

The company may again cede its EV championship to BYD if the actual results turn out to be softer than estimated, with Barclays predicting an 11% drop in second-quarter deliveries, Tesla's biggest ever.

Tesla has hit a speed bump after years of rapid growth that helped make it the world's most valuable automaker. It warned in January that deliveries growth in 2024 would be ""notably lower"" as a boost from months-long price cuts wanes.

The EV maker has cut output of its best-selling Model Y electric car by a double-digit percentage number at its Shanghai plant since March to address weakening demand for its aged models in China, its second-largest market after the United States, Reuters reported in May.

By comparison, its top Chinese competitor BYD maintained steady growth in EV sales, while EV upstarts such as Nio reported stellar growth last quarter. NIO's vehicle deliveries in the second quarter more than doubled to 57,300 units.

Price cuts and a growing shift in consumer demand to EVs and hybrids from gasoline-powered vehicles are the main reasons behind Chinese EV makers' strong sales in recent months, said Cui Dongshu, secretary general, China Passenger Car Association (CPCA).

Sales of new energy vehicles including EVs and plug-in hybrids in China made up 46.7% of total car sales in May, a fresh monthly high, as per CPCA data.

Yahoo Finance,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/why-snowflake-rallied-today-start-192200246.html,2024-07-01,19:22:00 UTC,Why Snowflake Rallied Today to Start July,"Shares of cloud-based data lake provider Snowflake (NYSE: SNOW) were in rally mode Monday even on a rather muted day for many tech stocks. Shares were up 4.8% as of 1:30 p.m. EDT.

Snowflake's outperformance is likely due to a positive note issued by analysts at Goldman Sachs, who added the stock to the firm's ""Conviction List"" today.

Goldman likes Snowflake's entry point and innovation pipeline

Goldman analyst Kash Rangan added Snowflake's stock to the firm's ""Conviction List"" today. Rangan's case is that he believes the recent weakness in the stock makes for an ""attractive entry point,"" given that the stock is down for the year, even while Rangan is optimistic about the company's new CEO Sridhar Ramaswamy. Rangan believes Ramaswamy, who is a more product-oriented manager than the company's previous head, can accelerate Snowflake's innovation engine to thrive in the AI era.

Of note, Ramaswamy co-founded AI search start-up Neeva in 2019, which Snowflake acquired last year, bringing Ramaswamy into Snowflake. Since then, he's been heading Snowflake's artificial intelligence (AI) strategy, including the development of Snowflake Cortex, a fully managed service that simplifies using Snowflake for AI applications. At the end of February, he was appointed CEO as former CEO Frank Slootman stepped back into the chairman of the board role.

Can Snowflake grow into its valuation?

Prior to the Goldman note today, Snowflake was about $135 per share -- not too far off from its $120 initial public offering (IPO) price back in September of 2020, nearly four years ago.

It's not that Snowflake the business hasn't performed well. Last quarter, core-product revenue surged 34%, and remaining performance obligations, which take into account new capacity to be consumed and recognized by Snowflake in future periods, accelerated 46%. Net retention, meaning how much existing customers used last quarter compared to the prior-year quarter, came in at a healthy 128%.

Still, there are worries. Management has guided to just 24% product-revenue growth for the full fiscal year, implying a deceleration. RPO was a bright spot relative to a year ago but actually slightly down from the prior quarter. And a net-retention rate of 128% actually marks a continued deceleration and the lowest figure in Snowflake's history as a public company.

With Snowflake having traded extremely expensively its entire life as a public corporation, it's still not particularly cheap at 15 times sales. So while Rangan may be looking at Snowflake's stock being down near its IPO price as a good entry point, keep in mind the stock is not particularly cheap overall. The new CEO will have to be able to reaccelerate growth through AI innovation in order for the stock to have material upside.

Savvy investors have gravitated toward both stocks. A company's share price tends to increase about twice as fast as the S&P 500 (SNPINDEX: ^GSPC) during the year following a stock split announcement.

Indeed, certain Wall Street analysts see substantial upside in Nvidia and Broadcom.

Beth Kendig at the I/O Fund expects Nvidia to achieve a $10 trillion market capitalization by 2030. That forecast implies about 230% upside from its current market capitalization of $3 trillion.

Joseph Moore at Morgan Stanley has outlined a bull-case price target that values Broadcom at $2,292 per share by June 2025. That will change to $229.20 per share after the stock split. Either way, that forecast implies 70% upside from its current price of $1,605 per share.

Here's what investors should know about Nvidia and Broadcom.

Nvidia: The market leading in data center GPUs and AI chips

Nvidia graphics processing units (GPUs) are the gold standard in rendering realistic computer graphics and accelerating complex data center workloads like artificial intelligence (AI) applications. Nvidia also provides adjacent data center hardware, such as central processing units (CPUs) and networking equipment, as well as subscription software and services that support graphics and AI workflows.

Nvidia holds more than 95% market share in workstation graphics processors and more than 90% market share in data center GPUs. Additionally, regarding AI specifically, The Wall Street Journal recently reported that ""Nvidia's chips underpin all of the most advanced AI systems, giving the company a market share estimated at more than 80%."" Looking ahead, Nvidia is unlikely to lose its leadership position anytime soon because it has a durable competitive advantage in CUDA.

Nvidia CUDA is a programming model lets GPUs (originally designed for graphics applications) accelerate all sorts of data center computing tasks. The CUDA ecosystem comprises hundreds of software libraries (building blocks) that streamline model training and application development. No other chipmaker has a comparable ecosystem of supporting software. In other words, competitors not only need to overcome the superior performance of Nvidia hardware, but also the immense convenience afforded to developers by Nvidia software.

Nvidia reported blockbuster financial results in the first quarter. Revenue increased 262% to $26 billion and non-GAAP net income soared 461% to $6.12 per diluted share. Nvidia is set to maintain that momentum as the AI market grows. In fact, CFRA analyst Angelo Zino recently said Nvidia ""will be the most important company to our civilization over the next decade.""

Story continues

Additionally, rapid innovation should keep the company ahead of its peers. Nvidia Blackwell GPUs offer four times faster AI training and 30 times faster AI inferencing as compared to the previous Hopper generation. Rosenblatt analyst Han Mosesmann recently said, ""The new Blackwell GPU platform, which ramps up later in 2024, is likely the most ambitious project Silicon Valley has ever witnessed.""

Wall Street expects Nvidia to grow earnings per share at 33% annually over the next three to five years. That makes its current valuation of 68 times adjusted earnings look a little expensive, but not unreasonably so. Investors should be prepared to pay a premium if they want to own this stock.

Personally, I am skeptical about Nvidia achieving a $10 trillion market capitalization by 2030. I certainly believe it's possible, but many things would have to go right for the company. That said, I do believe Nvidia will beat the S&P 500 over the next three to five years, so patient investors should consider buying a small position today.

Broadcom: The market leader in ASICs and networking chips

Broadcom breaks its business into semiconductor solutions and infrastructure software. The company earns semiconductor solutions revenue by developing chips for wired and wireless networking, data center storage, and other end markets. Broadcom also develops application specific integrated circuits (ASICs), chips purpose-built for specialized use cases like artificial intelligence. Additionally, Broadcom earns infrastructure software revenue from cybersecurity, monitoring, and virtualization products.

Broadcom is the leading provider of ASICs with 35% market share, while its closest competitor Marvell Technology holds 12% market share. It is also the leader in networking and wireless chips. That puts Broadcom in a good position because AI adoption is driving demand for ASICs and networking chips. Analysts at Goldman Sachs recently wrote, ""Alongside Nvidia, we view Broadcom as a critical piece to the ongoing AI infrastructure build-out.""

Broadcom reported solid financial results in the second quarter, beating estimates on the top and bottom lines. Revenue surged 43% to $12.5 billion on particularly strong demand for AI chips and virtualization software. Meanwhile, GAAP net income declined 46% to $4.42 per diluted share, but that was due to costs associated with its 2023 acquisition of VMware. Non-GAAP operating income increased 32% during the second quarter.

Broadcom is a hidden gem among AI stocks because Nvidia casts a long shadow. But its strong position in ASICs and networking chips should be a source of momentous revenue growth in the coming years. Indeed, management expects AI chips to account for 25% of its semiconductor solutions revenue in 2025, up from 15% in 2023.

However, Wall Street expects the company to grow earnings per share at 17% annually over the next three to five years. That makes its current valuation of 69 times earnings look expensive, especially when the three-year average is 32 times earnings. To be fair, earnings may grow more quickly than anticipated depending on how the VMware integration progresses. But I plan to avoid the stock until the valuation appears more reasonable. To that end, I see little chance of an 70% return over the next 12 months.

Yahoo Finance,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/2-stocks-could-crush-nasdaq-092000151.html,2024-07-01,09:20:00 UTC,2 Stocks That Could Crush the Nasdaq Over the Next Five Years,"The Nasdaq Composite has returned an average annual return of 11% over the last 30 years. That comes out to a cumulative return of 2,440%. That's an enviable return on investment over the long term. If you want to beat that return, you need to invest in stocks with above-average growth prospects.

Stock prices can fluctuate for all kinds of reasons in the near term, so trying to beat the market day to day is a fool's errand. However, over many years, there is a high correlation between a company's earnings performance and the stock's return. If you focus on companies that can at least double their earnings in five years, which comes to an annualized earnings increase of 15%, you significantly stack the odds in your favor of beating the market.

To give you some ideas, here are two top stocks that have the potential to double in value in five years and outperform the Nasdaq.

1. Carnival

Carnival (NYSE: CCL) is the largest cruise line in the world and continues to benefit from strong demand. The stock is up 18% over the past year, and while that is less than the Nasdaq's return of 33%, Carnival's prospects for improving earnings growth in the coming years could potentially double the share price over the next five years.

With revenue growing at a healthy rate due to strong demand for cruise vacations, management is focusing more on managing costs to deliver profitable growth. In the May-ended quarter, Carnival posted a 17% year-over-year increase in revenue and turned a year-ago loss into a net profit of $92 million.

Looking ahead, Carnival should drive higher margins and profits from two opportunities. The first is next year's planned opening of Celebration Key, an exclusive destination that is close to Carnival's ports and should lower fuel costs to boost profits. Strong demand for travel to this new destination will allow the company to gradually raise ticket prices over time and realize high returns on the company's investment.

Another opportunity for profitable growth is the transfer of Carnival's vessels from its P&O Cruises Australia brand into Carnival Cruise Line, which will expand capacity for the better-performing Carnival brand.

Wall Street analysts expect Carnival to grow earnings at an annualized rate of 12% over the long term. If the stock's forward price-to-earnings ratio moves up from its current 16.3 multiple to 20, which is more in line with its pre-pandemic valuation range, Carnival stock could double in value in the next five years.

2. Uber Technologies

Uber Technologies (NYSE: UBER) continues to grow revenue thanks to a large base of 7 million people earning money with its service every month. The stock has climbed 66% over the past year, effectively doubling the Nasdaq's return of 33%, but the stock has plenty of room to run in the coming years.

Uber's first-quarter results show the business growing at the rates investors need to double their money. In the first quarter, gross bookings, revenue, and the number of trips each grew 15% or higher year over year.

One important catalyst could drive strong earnings growth over the next five years. Uber is using its valuable data to offer advertising to connect merchants with consumers. The company launched Uber Journey Ads in 2022, which helps brands gain exposure to consumers using Uber, and it's growing into a multibillion-dollar opportunity.

Uber achieved $900 million of annualized advertising revenue in the fourth quarter of 2023. It's a small piece of a business generating over $10 billion of quarterly revenue, but advertising generates high margins that can benefit its low-margin delivery business.

Piper Sandler analysts called Uber a ""sleeping giant"" in advertising recently due to its large customer base. The consensus estimate has Uber's earnings reaching $4.31 by 2026 and growing 45% on an annualized basis over the next several years. This puts Uber stock on track to double in value within the next five years.

A stock split is an event where a publicly traded company cosmetically alters its share price and outstanding share count by the same magnitude. It's ""cosmetic"" in the sense that changing a company's share price and share count by the same factor has no effect on its market cap or operating performance.

There are two types of stock splits: forward and reverse. With a forward-stock split, companies are angling to make their shares more nominally affordable for retail investors who might not have access to fractional-share purchases with their broker. Meanwhile, a reverse-stock split aims to increase a company's share price, often with the goal of ensuring it meets the minimum continued listing standards on a major stock exchange.

Most investors tend to favor forward-stock splits, because the companies enacting forward splits are typically out-innovating and out-executing their peers.

Since 2024 began, nine high-profile stocks have announced or completed a stock split. However, not all of these stock-split stocks share the same outlook. As we motor into the second half of 2024, one of these stock-split stocks stands out as a phenomenal deal for patient investors, while two others are worth avoiding.

Stock-split stock No. 1 that's worth avoiding in the second half of 2024: Nvidia

In spite of its undeniable popularity, AI juggernaut Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA) is the first stock-split I'd suggest investors purposefully avoid for the final six months of 2024. Nvidia announced a 10-for-1 forward split on May 22, which was completed on June 7.

Although I'm no fan of Nvidia from an investment perspective, I'm happy to give the company credit where it's due. Nvidia's AI-graphics processing units (GPUs) have set the standard in high-compute data centers. According to semiconductor analysis firm TechInsights, it was responsible for 98% of the 3.85 million AI-GPUs that were shipped last year. Having first-mover and compute advantages over its peers has given the company substantial pricing power.

But this is where the praise ends and history works its way back into the discussion.

Since the advent of the internet in the mid-1990s, there hasn't been a buzzy innovation, technology, or trend that avoided an early stage euphoria-bursting event. This is to say that investors have overestimated the adoption and/or utility of every next-big-thing innovation or technology for 30 years (including the internet itself). While this doesn't mean artificial intelligence and Nvidia can't be wildly successful over the long run, the simple fact that most businesses lack a concrete plan for AI suggests a bubble is brewing.

Story continues

To add to this point, Nvidia's trailing-12-month price-to-sales (P/S) ratio is strikingly similar to the P/S ratio peaks we witnessed from Cisco Systems and Amazon prior to the dot-com bubble bursting. History may not precisely repeat on Wall Street, but it does have a tendency to rhyme.

We're also starting to see evidence that competition will weigh on Nvidia's monopoly like market share in AI-accelerated data centers. Even if the company's GPUs were to maintain their compute advantages, new competitors can benefit from demand overwhelming supply — and Nvidia can't meet all of its enterprise demand.

Furthermore, Nvidia's four-largest customers by net sales are internally developing their own AI-GPUs. Even if these chips are used as a complement to Nvidia's H100 GPU, it signals the intent by America's most-influential businesses to reduce their reliance on Nvidia's hardware.

Stock-split stock No. 2 to keep your distance from in the latter half of 2024: Chipotle Mexican Grill

The second stock-split stock that investors would be wise to avoid in the second half of 2024 is none other than the hottest fast-casual restaurant chain on Wall Street, Chipotle Mexican Grill (NYSE: CMG). Chipotle's board announced the company's first-ever stock split (a 50-for-1 forward split) on March 19, with its share adjustment occurring after the closing bell on June 25.

Similar to Nvidia, I can recognize that Chipotle and its management team have done a lot right, even if I'm not currently a fan from an investment standpoint. Chipotle shares have rallied more than 14,800% since its initial public offering price of $22 in January 2006 due to a combination of simplicity and innovation.

Chipotle has kept things simple by sourcing its vegetables locally (when possible), using responsibly raised meats, prepping its food daily, and avoiding a bulky menu. The result is a well-oiled machine that quickly prepares meals and keeps lines in its stores moving.

But there's only so much innovation that can be squeezed out of a fast-casual restaurant chain. While the introduction of mobile order-dedicated drive-thru lanes (""Chipotlanes"") has helped the company immensely, Chipotle's same-store sales grew by only 7% during the first quarter. Though 7% same-store sales growth would be phenomenal for most businesses, it's a genuine eyesore for a company valued at roughly 50 times forward-year earnings.

I'll also add that 1.6% of the 7% organic growth rate in existing stores came from an ""increase in average check."" While it's always good news when a company enjoys strong pricing power, nearly a quarter of Chipotle's organic sales growth is simply due to inflation.

Considering that there are still predictive indicators that suggest a U.S. economic downturn is on the horizon — e.g., the historic decline in U.S. M2 money supply — companies with premium valuations in traditionally slower-growing industries, like Chipotle, are the likeliest to get thumped if a recession does materialize.

The stock-split stock you can confidently buy for the second half of 2024: Sirius XM Holdings

Out of the nine high-profile companies to have announced a stock split in 2024, eight are conducting forward splits. However, the best value of the group is the only top-tier company slated to complete a reverse-stock split: satellite-radio provider Sirius XM Holdings (NASDAQ: SIRI).

In a June 17 filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission, Sirius XM announced its intent to conduct a 1-for-10 reverse split upon completing its merger with Liberty Media's Sirius XM tracking stock, Liberty Sirius XM Group. This combination and share consolidation, which'll create a single outstanding share base, is expected to close during the third quarter.

Although reverse-stock splits are usually undertaken by companies on the decline, Sirius XM's operating performance has pointed to steady growth over the long haul.

One of the keys to Sirius XM's success is its revenue diversity. Terrestrial and online radio providers generate most of their sales from advertising. The thing about advertising is that it's highly cyclical and prone to fluctuations. Sirius XM brought in less than 19% of its first-quarter sales from ads (via Pandora).

By comparison, Sirius XM generated close to 78% of its sales in the March-ended quarter from subscriptions. Subscribers to its satellite-radio services are far less likely to cancel than businesses are to reduce their ad spending during periods of economic turbulence. Couple this with the fact that Sirius XM is the only licensed satellite-radio operator — ergo, it has exceptionally strong pricing power — and you have a recipe for steady operating cash flow in virtually any economic climate.

Additionally, Sirius XM enjoys better cost transparency than most radio operators. Whereas content and royalty costs are going to ebb-and-flow from quarter to quarter, transmission and equipment expenses aren't going to change much, if at all, regardless of how many subscribers the company adds.

At no point in Sirius XM's 30 years as a publicly traded company has it been cheaper than it is now. Shares can be scooped up by opportunistic investors for just 8 times forward-year earnings, which represents a 55% discount to its average forward-year earnings multiple over the last five years.

Yahoo Finance,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/nvidia-top-ai-stock-dont-000000523.html,2024-07-02,00:00:00 UTC,"Nvidia Is a Top AI Stock, but Don't Ignore These 4 Red Flags","Nvidia's (NASDAQ: NVDA) stock has rallied more than 600% over the past two years. Most of that rally was driven by the growth of the artificial intelligence (AI) market, which boosted its sales of data center GPUs for processing complex AI tasks.

The market's insatiable demand for its data center chips continues to outstrip its available supply, and analysts expect Nvidia's revenue to increase at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 45% from fiscal 2024 to fiscal 2027 (which ends in January 2027). They expect its earnings per share (EPS) to rise at a CAGR of 51%.

Image source: Nvidia.

So even though Nvidia is already worth more than $3 trillion, it could still have plenty of room to run. But before investors buy this high-flying stock, they should pay attention to these four red flags that could unexpectedly end its historic rally.

1. It's become an all-in play on AI chips

Back in fiscal 2022 (which ended in January 2022), Nvidia generated 46% of its revenue from its gaming GPUs, 39% from its data center GPUs, and the rest from its professional visualization, auto, and OEM chips. However, that product mix completely changed over the following two years as its sales of data center chips eclipsed its gaming chips.

In the first quarter of fiscal 2025, Nvidia generated 87% of its revenue from data center chips, 10% from gaming chips, and the remaining 3% from its other categories. It generated $22.6 billion in data center revenue in that single quarter compared to its total revenue of nearly $27 billion for all of fiscal 2023. That breakneck expansion transformed Nvidia from a more diversified GPU maker to an all-in play on AI chips.

That's fine if you believe Nvidia will continue dominating the AI market as it expands. But if the AI market abruptly cools off, Nvidia's chip shortage could quickly become a supply glut. If its data center business sputters out, it can't fall back on the growth of its gaming segment and other smaller divisions to soften those year-over-year comparisons.

2. It faces unpredictable regulatory challenges

Nvidia's overwhelming dependence on the AI market exposes it to a lot of unpredictable regulatory challenges. U.S. regulators have repeatedly tightened their export curbs on its AI chip shipments to China, and that pressure could drive Chinese chipmakers to accelerate the development of their own AI chips.

Tighter regulations for generative AI technologies, which have already taken effect in Europe, could throttle the growth of the red-hot industry and drive companies to rein in their purchases of new AI chips. Complaints about mass plagiarism and other ethical issues could also force AI companies to expand at a slower and more measured pace.

Story continues

3. It faces clear competitive threats

Nvidia controls 88% of the discrete GPU market, according to JPR, but its top rival AMD has been rolling out cheaper AI accelerators. AMD's MI300 Instinct GPUs have already beat Nvidia's H100 GPUs -- which cost about four times more -- in terms of raw processing power and memory usage across several industry benchmarks. Intel also recently claimed its new Gaudi 3 AI accelerators are faster and more power efficient than Nvidia's H100 GPUs.

Super Micro Computer, which grew rapidly over the past few years by producing dedicated AI servers powered by Nvidia's chips, has also been developing new servers optimized for AMD's and Intel's cheaper AI accelerators. These cheaper servers could attract cost-conscious data center operators and erode Nvidia's market share.

Meanwhile, Nvidia's tight supply and high prices are driving its top customers -- including OpenAI, Microsoft, Alphabet's Google, and Amazon -- to develop their own first-party AI accelerators. These chips won't threaten Nvidia's near-term growth, but they could gradually loosen its iron grip on the hyperscale data center market.

4. Its insiders are net sellers

Nvidia's stock isn't cheap at 49 times forward earnings and 26 times this year's sales. But if it had the potential to double or triple again in near term, its valuations would seem reasonable and its insiders should be scooping up more shares.

Yet over the past 12 months, Nvidia's insiders sold more than 4 times as many shares as they bought. Over the past three months, they sold more than 52 times as many shares as they bought. Those insider sales don't necessarily mean it stock is headed off a cliff, but it's a worrisome trend that suggests its near-term upside is limited.

Is it still safe to buy Nvidia's stock?

I believe Nvidia is still worth buying, but investors shouldn't assume it's a perfect growth stock. Its transformation from a gaming company into an AI one was abrupt, and it could experience significant growing pains over the next few years. But assuming it overcomes all those competitive, regulatory, and macro challenges, it should remain one of the easiest ways to profit from the secular expansion of the AI market.

The stock is up over 45% so far in 2024. That's great news for shareholders. However, for some investors, this tremendous success pushed Broadcom's share price so high (over $1,600) that they were reluctant to buy.

That won't be a problem for too much longer. In its first-quarter update a few weeks ago, Broadcom announced plans for a 10-for-1 stock split after the market close on July 12, 2024. The semiconductor and software maker's shares will trade on a split-adjusted basis beginning July 15, 2024.

Broadcom CFO Kirsten Spears said the purpose of this stock split for ""to make ownership of Broadcom stock more accessible to investors and employees."" Some believe this greater accessibility could provide a nice catalyst for the already high-flying stock. Should you buy Broadcom stock hand over fist before its 10-for-1 stock split?

The case for Broadcom

Historically, stocks have jumped 25% during the 12 months following a stock split announcement, according to the Bank of America Research Investment Committee. Broadcom's shares have risen only around 8% since the announcement of its stock split, so it could still have plenty of room to run if history is a guide.

Are there reasons to buy Broadcom stock other than a potential stock split surge? Absolutely. I'd put the company's acquisition of VMware near the top of the list. This deal contributed significantly to Broadcom's revenue soaring 43% year over year in the second quarter of 2024. Earlier this year, Broadcom CEO Hock Tan said that the company expects VMWare's revenue growth will accelerate through the remainder of fiscal 2024.

However, the biggest reason to buy Broadcom stock is its artificial intelligence (AI) opportunity. Seven of the eight largest AI clusters in the world use Broadcom's Ethernet technology. Broadcom expects its networking revenue to jump 40% this year primarily due to AI-related demand.

The company's AI accelerator business is highly profitable. Creating networks to connect AI accelerators is complicated. But Broadcom is arguably the best at doing it. As Tan said in the Q2 earnings call, the company has ""the deepest and broadest understanding of what it takes for complex large workloads to be scaled out in an AI fabric.""

Broadcom is also a free cash flow (FCF) machine. In Q2, the company generated FCF of $4.4 billion -- 36% of total revenue. If we exclude the cash Broadcom used for restructuring and integration, its FCF rose 18% year over year to $5.3 billion and made up 42% of revenue.

Story continues

The case against Broadcom

Despite the excitement about Broadcom's stock split, it won't change anything about the company's underlying business. Also, investors who wanted to buy the stock but were leery of its high share price could have done so with fractional shares.

Broadcom's growth story wouldn't be nearly as impressive without the VMWare deal. Excluding VMWare, Q2 revenue increased by only 12% year over year. The company won't be able to rely on the acquisition to boost its year-over-year numbers after Q4, since the transaction closed on Nov. 22, 2023.

Some parts of Broadcom's business remain weak. Wireless revenue in Q2 rose only 2% year over year. Server storage connectivity revenue fell 27%. Broadband revenue plunged 39%.

Just five customers generate roughly 40% of total sales. Apple alone makes up 17% of Broadcom's total revenue. This reliance on a small number of customers presents a key risk for Broadcom.

The company's AI opportunity is big. However, Nvidia could emerge as a strong competitor to Broadcom in Ethernet switching and custom AI accelerators.

There's also a potential valuation concern. Broadcom stock trades at nearly 34 times forward earnings and 16.7 times trailing 12-month sales.

Buy before the split?

I don't think investors should be in a rush to buy Broadcom stock before its stock split. My hunch is that the split will be largely a non-event rather than a major catalyst.

That said, Broadcom could remain a winner over the long term. Patient investors could buy now, wait until the stock split, or hold off for a pullback to buy on the dip. If you plan on owning Broadcom for 10 years or more, the exact timing of when you buy probably won't matter all that much.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - A U.S. stock rally supercharged by excitement over artificial intelligence is drawing comparisons with the dotcom bubble two decades ago, raising the question of whether prices have again been inflated by optimism over a revolutionary technology.

AI fever, coupled with a resilient economy and stronger earnings, has lifted the S&P 500 index to fresh records this year following a run of more than 50% from its October 2022 low. The tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite index has gained over 70% since the end of 2022.

While various metrics show stock valuations and investor exuberance have yet to hit peaks reached at the turn of the century, the similarities are easy to spot. A small group of massive tech stocks including AI chipmaker Nvidia symbolize today's market, recalling the ""Four Horsemen"" of the late 1990s: Cisco, Dell, Microsoft and Intel.

The dizzying run in shares of Nvidia, which gained nearly 4,300% in a recent five-year period, stirred memories of how network equipment maker Cisco surged about 4,500% over five years leading up to its peak in 2000, according to a BTIG comparison of the two stocks.

Valuations have grown as well, though many tech champions appear to be in far better financial shape than their dot-com counterparts of the late 1990s and early 2000s. Other measures, such as investor bullishness, have yet to reach the frothy heights of the turn of the century.

The concern is that the AI-driven surge will end the same way as the dot-com boom - with an epic crash. After nearly quadrupling in just over three years, the Nasdaq Composite plunged almost 80% from its March 2000 peak to October 2002. The S&P 500, which doubled in a similar timeframe, collapsed nearly 50% in that period.

While several internet stocks such as Amazon survived and eventually thrived, others never recovered.

""No one exactly knows what will happen with artificial intelligence,"" said Sameer Samana, senior global market strategist at the Wells Fargo Investment Institute, noting the same uncertainty about the eventual long-term winners.

Echoing the dot-com boom, the information technology sector has swelled to 32% of the S&P 500's total market value, the largest percentage since 2000 when it rose to nearly 35%, according to LSEG Datastream. Just three companies, Microsoft, Apple and Nvidia, represent over 20% of the index.

However, tech stocks are more modestly valued now than at the peak of the dot-com bubble, trading at 31 times forward earnings, compared to as high as 48 times in 2000, according to Datastream.

Story continues

The difference is clear in the valuations of Nvidia and Cisco, a key provider of products supporting internet infrastructure, whose stock has yet to rescale its peaks of the dotcom boom.

While both stocks have soared, Nvidia trades at 40 times forward earnings estimates, compared to Cisco's 131 level reached in March 2000, according to Datastream.

Capital Economics analysts also note that the current rally is being fueled more by solid earnings outlooks rather than growing valuations, a sign that fundamentals are more of a driver this time.

Forward earnings per share in sectors containing today's market leaders - tech, communication services and consumer discretionary - have been growing faster since early 2023 than the rest of the market, a Capital Economics analysis showed. By contrast, expected earnings in the sectors grew at a similar pace to the rest of the market in the late 1990s and early 2000s, while their valuations soared faster than for other stocks.

More broadly, the S&P 500's price-to-earnings ratio of 21 is well above its historical average but below the roughly 25 level reached in 1999 and 2000, according to Datastream.

""Our base case is that this tech bubble won't burst until the valuation of the overall market has reached the sort of level that it did in 2000,"" Capital Economics analysts said in a note.

Dotcom investors were much more euphoric by some measures. Bullish sentiment in the widely followed American Association of Individual Investors survey, often seen as a worrisome indicator at high levels, reached 75% in January 2000, just months before the market peaked. It recently stood at 44.5%, compared to its historical average of 37.5%.

While an AI bubble is not a foregone conclusion, many investors are wary that metrics could become even more stretched in coming months if U.S. growth remains robust and tech stocks continue charging higher.

""There are a lot of similarities,"" said Mike O'Rourke, chief market strategist at JonesTrading. ""When you have a bubble, usually it's rooted in ... some true, positive, fundamental development that is behind it and that creates that enthusiasm for people to pay any price for things.""

(Reporting by Lewis Krauskopf; Editing by Ira Iosebashvili and Richard Chang)","By Lewis KrauskopfNEW YORK (Reuters) - A U.S. stock rally supercharged by excitement over artificial intelligence is drawing comparisons with the dotcom bubble two decades ago, raising the question of whether prices have again been inflated by optimism over a revolutionary technology.
A small group of massive tech stocks including AI chipmaker Nvidia symbolize today's market, recalling the ""Four Horsemen"" of the late 1990s: Cisco, Dell, Microsoft and Intel.
The concern is that the AI-driven surge will end the same way as the dot-com boom - with an epic crash.
However, tech stocks are more modestly valued now than at the peak of the dot-com bubble, trading at 31 times forward earnings, compared to as high as 48 times in 2000, according to Datastream.

Yahoo Finance,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/3-top-dividend-stocks-plan-091800920.html,2024-07-01,09:18:00 UTC,3 Top Dividend Stocks I Plan to Buy Hand Over Fist This July,"I'm a pretty active investor. Cash routinely flows into my brokerage accounts from passive income sources and recurring transfers. I like to immediately put most of the money to work to generate more passive income.

High-quality, high-yielding dividend stocks are my go-to investment. I routinely add to my favorite positions. This month, I plan to continue buying shares of Realty Income (NYSE: O), Brookfield Infrastructure (NYSE: BIPC)(NYSE: BIP), and Enbridge (NYSE: ENB). Here's why I can't seem to get enough of these top-notch income stocks.

The name says it all

Realty Income has a phenomenal record of paying dividends. The diversified REIT has declared 647 consecutive monthly dividends. It has increased its payout 126 times since going public in 1994, including for the past 107 straight quarters, growing its payout at a 4.3% compound annual rate.

I fully expect that steady upward trend in the payout, which at a 6% yield is well above the S&P 500's 1.3% average, to continue. Realty Income's internal growth drivers -- rising rents and using retained cash flow after paying dividends to fund new investments -- should increase its adjusted funds from operations (FFO) by about 2% per share each year. That provides a solid foundation for a steadily rising dividend.

Meanwhile, the company estimates it can add about 0.5% to its FFO per share growth rate for every $1 billion of externally funded acquisitions it makes. Those acquisitions are financed by selling stock and issuing new debt. Realty Income conservatively estimates it can externally fund $4 billion to $6 billion of acquisitions each year. When added to its internal growth drivers, this should push its FFO per share growth rate to about 4% to 5% annually, in line with its historical growth rate. With trillions of dollars in commercial real estate across the U.S. and Europe, Realty Income should have plenty of new investment opportunities.

The high-powered growth should continue

Brookfield Infrastructure has done an excellent job of increasing its dividend. The global infrastructure operator has grown its payout at a 9% compound annual rate since 2009.

It should have plenty of fuel to grow its payout in the future. Brookfield expects a trio of organic drivers -- inflation-indexed rate increases, volume growth as the global economy expands, and expansion projects funded with retained cash flow after paying dividends -- to boost its FFO per share by 6% to 9% annually. The company has a large backlog of expansion projects underway, including several data center developments and two new semiconductor fabrication facilities it's helping finance.

Story continues

On top of organic growth, Brookfield has an excellent record of making accretive acquisitions. It recently agreed to buy an additional 10% interest in its Brazilian integrated rail and logistics provider, and it's working to purchase a portfolio of telecom towers in India. It's funding these deals by recycling capital. Brookfield believes that acquisitions will help drive its FFO growth rate into the double digits. That easily supports its plan to increase its dividend, which yields around 5%, by 5% to 9% per year.

Ample fuel to continue growing

Enbridge has paid dividends to its investors for nearly seven decades. The Canadian pipeline and utility giant has increased its payout every year for the past 29.

The company should have plenty of fuel to continue increasing its dividend, which yields a monster 7.5% these days, for the next several years. It's in the process of closing a once-in-a-generation acquisition of three high-quality gas utilities in the United States. That deal will immediately boost its earnings, enhance its diversification and income stability, and add to its growth profile.

In addition, the company has a robust organic growth backlog. It has billions of dollars in commercially secured projects under construction that should come online through 2028. These projects should help grow its cash flow per share by 3% annually through 2026 and by a roughly 5% per year pace after that. That visible earnings growth, along with its top-notch financial profile, positions Enbridge to continue increasing its dividend each year.

High-quality income stocks

Realty Income, Brookfield Infrastructure, and Enbridge are my ideal income stocks. They pay well above-average dividends, and those payouts should continue rising steadily in the future. Those factors are driving my decision to continue buying these top-notch income stocks hand over fist in July.

Should you invest $1,000 in Enbridge right now?

On Bogleheads.org, a post titled ""Let me retire! Please?"" sparked a discussion about early retirement viability.

A couple from Pennsylvania, aged 56 and 54, is contemplating quitting their high-paying jobs to pursue volunteer activities. With a 14-year-old child, the couple seeks advice on whether their financial situation can support a sustainable retirement in a high-cost-of-living (HCOL) area.

Don't Miss:

The couple has a combined income of $450,000 in 2024 and expects to spend $180,000 annually post-2025. They have an effective federal tax rate of 24% and a state tax rate of 3.07%. Their total portfolio is $5.1 million, and they allocated 55% to stocks (20% international), 30% to bonds, and 15% to cash. They are primarily invested in Vanguard and Schwab funds with an expense ratio of 0.10%. They have no debt or mortgage, and their projected Social Security benefits are $35,000 for him at age 70 and $19,000 for her at age 62.

Several forum members provided their perspectives on the couple's retirement plan. The consensus is optimistic, with some variations in opinion on portfolio risk and spending flexibility.

One user noted, ""As long as your expenses are accurate, you should be fine. You are a touch on the conservative side with your investments, but you would likely be fine even without Social Security, providing a buffer for you."" Applying the 4% rule, which suggests a safe withdrawal rate of 4% of the portfolio, the couple could potentially withdraw $204,000 annually. This aligns well with their predicted spending of $180,000, leaving some room for unexpected expenses or market downturns.

Another user asked, ""What is the breakout of your portfolio (401(k), brokerage, Roth, etc.)? How much help do you intend to give your 14-year-old for college and later?"" Clarifications were requested regarding the breakdown of their portfolio and college funding plans for their child.

Trending: This Jeff Bezos-backed startup will allow you to become a landlord in just 10 minutes, and you only need $100.

Some forum members noted that the couple's current 55/45 asset allocation is somewhat conservative but within a safe range. One member suggested, ""I would therefore also suggest that you up your equities from 55% to 60%. Move that money from bonds to equities, not cash to equities.""

Story continues

The 4% rule, while a good guideline, may need adjustments given the couple's early retirement age and long retirement horizon. Another member commented, ""A 3.5% withdrawal rate is nearly guaranteed to last you 30 years with that asset allocation.""

The couple needs to remain flexible with their spending, especially in response to market fluctuations. One user advised, ""Make yourself a ‘retirement spending' list. This can be quite different from ‘while working.'""

Health care costs could increase significantly before Medicare kicks in. Another user asked, ""Have you researched costs when you're both on Medicare?""

Trending: Elon Musk and Jeff Bezos are bullish on one city that could dethrone New York and become the new financial capital of the US. Investing in its booming real estate market has never been more accessible.

It's important to understand these expenses and factor them into the retirement budget. College expenses for their child should also be planned for, ensuring they don't derail their retirement plans. Exploring Roth conversions and understanding ACA subsidies until Medicare eligibility could provide additional tax advantages and cost savings.

The couple appears well-positioned for early retirement, provided they maintain flexibility in their spending and remain vigilant about potential market changes. Their financial situation allows for a comfortable retirement, but ongoing assessment and potential adjustments to their portfolio and spending will be crucial for long-term success.

Would you feel confident about retiring now if you were in their shoes?

If you're uncertain about your early retirement plans or think you may need to address specific financial goals, consider consulting a financial advisor. They can help create a personalized plan tailored to your unique situation.

Yahoo Finance,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/1-incredible-growth-stock-down-122900631.html,2024-07-01,12:29:00 UTC,1 Incredible Growth Stock Down 81% You'll Regret Not Buying on the Dip,"The S&P 500 has set one new all-time high after another in 2024, but not every stock has participated in the current bull market. Some stocks remain beaten down, well below the highs reached in late 2021 and early 2022.

Some of the companies behind those stocks benefited from the behavior changes ushered in by the COVID-19 pandemic. But as things start to resemble the way things were pre-pandemic, they don't look as attractive. Others, however, look oversold, and their current valuations don't reflect their true potential.

One example of the latter is PayPal (NASDAQ: PYPL). PayPal's share price surged as COVID-19 drove more online and contactless sales. But a couple of bad quarters and a CEO change led to a massive sell-off in shares. The stock currently trades around 81% below the all-time high it reached in mid-2021. Here's why it may be a great opportunity to buy up some shares.

Image source: Getty Images.

It's already showing signs of a turnaround

One of the biggest things weighing on PayPal over the past year was its declining active account total. Active accounts peaked in the fourth quarter of 2022 and experienced four consecutive sequential declines during 2023.

But active accounts increased in the first quarter, climbing 2 million to reach 427 million total. While there's still a long way to go to get back to where it was at the end of 2022, the turnaround progress is encouraging.

The biggest driver of the active account decline was churn from inactive accounts in emerging markets in the Latin America and Asia Pacific regions. It's now growing by adding users who are spending more and more frequently. Total payment volume was up 14% year over year despite fewer users than this time last year. Transactions per active account over the past year reached an all-time high of 60.

The virtuous cycle driving strong engagement growth

The growing engagement of PayPal users signals its network advantage. On one side of the network are consumers and on the other side are merchants. The massive consumer base using PayPal draws more merchants to accept the digital wallet and the growing number of merchants taking PayPal draws more consumers to the platform. A growing number of merchants also gives existing users more opportunities to use PayPal.

There's good reason for merchants to choose PayPal, too. Not only does it add another payment option for around 400 million online shoppers, but it also makes them more likely to complete a transaction. The company reports a 33% increase in checkout conversions when the buyer uses PayPal versus another form of payment.

Story continues

While PayPal faces competition, none of its competitors has a user base the size of PayPal. That makes it practically indispensable for online merchants.

That said, fierce competition can and has weighed on PayPal's ability to charge higher fees for merchants. It also pushed the company to allow more consumer choice in its default payments, instead of forcing them to pay using methods more lucrative for the company (like cash balances).

Still, it's hard to deny PayPal's position as the leading digital wallet, putting it in a prime position for the continued secular growth in e-commerce.

The stock is an absolute bargain

The stock currently trades for a forward price-to-earnings ratio below 14x. That's incredibly low, even if you expect competition to eat into its revenue growth and margins.

Management's updated full-year 2024 guidance calls for mid- to high-single-digit earnings-per-share (EPS) growth. PayPal should be able to drive double-digit revenue growth as it returns to year-over-year active account growth this year. While non-branded checkout has weighed on its gross margin, it's cutting costs in other areas, which should result in stable to growing operating margins. That could mean PayPal exceeds its current full-year outlook.

What's more, PayPal is aggressively buying back shares at this price. It forecasts $5 billion in free cash flow, and management plans to repurchase even more than $5 billion in shares this year. That provides a further boost to earnings per share.

Wall Street analysts currently expect PayPal to grow its earnings per share at a compound annual rate of almost 16% over the next five years as a result of the above factors. So, with shares trading under 14x earnings, they present an incredible bargain for investors.

One such couple recently sought advice from financial expert Suze Orman on whether to buy a home or rent a luxury senior apartment.

The husband and wife are financially secure, with a combined monthly income of over $9,000 from pensions and Social Security, savings of around $100,000, and $850,000 in an IRA, annuity, and Roth account.

Don't Miss:

The average American couple has saved this much money for retirement — How do you compare ?

Warren Buffett once said, ""If you don't find a way to make money while you sleep, you will work until you die."" These high-yield real estate notes that pay 7.5% – 9% make earning passive income easier than ever.

Orman first highlighted the couple's solid financial standing, noting they have no debt and can sell their current home for $450,000 to $500,000 without incurring capital gains tax. This financial freedom means buying or renting isn't strictly about money but lifestyle preferences and practical considerations.

She pointed out the physical demands of home maintenance as a significant factor for retirees. ""They are in their seventies and are not sure if they are up to the challenge of daily housekeeping maintenance at their age,"" she said. KT KT echoed these concerns, highlighting that such tasks become increasingly burdensome as people age.

""After 70, you start to feel it,"" KT remarked, highlighting the importance of considering one's physical capabilities when deciding on living arrangements.

The couple is torn between the husband's preference for buying a home and the wife's inclination toward a luxury senior community apartment. The wife enjoys socializing and traveling, benefiting from the amenities and services such communities provide.

Suze Orman provided a compelling argument for the wife's choice, focusing on the benefits of senior community living. ""You have a community around you,"" she said, recounting the positive experiences of both her mother and KT's mother in similar settings. These communities offer various activities and social opportunities, such as happy hours, educational classes, movies, swimming, and golf.

Trending: Elon Musk and Jeff Bezos are bullish on one city that could dethrone New York and become the new financial capital of the US. Investing in its booming real estate market has never been more accessible.

Orman stressed the importance of moving to a senior community while both partners are healthy. ""In most cases, you can't move in if one of you is seriously ill,"" she advised, urging the couple to make the transition sooner rather than later. She also noted women’s higher life expectancy, which could leave the wife managing a house alone if her husband passes away first.

Story continues

Orman humorously warned, ""Your husband probably shouldn't hear this part of the answer,"" referring to the predominantly female demographics of senior communities and the social perks for the few men who live there.

Financial experts often advise evaluating the costs and benefits of both options for seniors with existing homes like this couple. Selling a house can free up equity that can be used to fund other retirement needs or investments while renting can simplify life by eliminating the need for ongoing maintenance and large, unexpected expenses.

While buying a home can offer stability, and potential equity growth, renting may provide a more carefree lifestyle, especially valuable in the later stages of life.

Financially, the couple can afford either option. Orman, however, leaned toward the wife's preference for a senior community, emphasizing its convenience and reduced responsibilities. She advised the husband to ""listen to your wife here because, in the long run, you're gonna be so happy that you did.""

If you’re exploring options for your retirement living arrangements, remember that the right choice depends on your individual needs and priorities. Consider factors like home maintenance, social engagement, and desired lifestyle when making this important decision. Consulting with a financial advisor can provide valuable guidance and ensure you make the best choice for your golden years.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - Global hedge funds in June sold U.S. shares of technology, media and telecommunications (TMT) companies at the fastest pace since 2016, mainly driven by semiconductor stocks, Goldman Sachs said in note.

The sales could indicate that portfolio managers have become more bearish on tech stocks, after the sector's powerful rally in the first half of the year, although the note does not provide any reason behind the trend.

The bank, which compiles its clients' positioning for the data, said semiconductor and software were the top two most sold sectors in June, while hedge funds increased their allocation to tech hardware and electronic equipment.

Tech stocks led the S&P 500 index's strong performance in the first half of the year, with artificial intelligence chipmaker Nvidia up 150% and generating 30% of the index's 15% return.

Overall, Goldman Sachs said hedge funds net sold global equities for a third straight month, almost entirely driven by short sellers who borrowed shares to sell on bets that the price will decline, enabling them to buy them back for less.

The rise of AI would lift many companies to new heights while sending some to the brink of extinction. For instance, Nvidia, a leading supplier of graphics processing units (GPUs) for AI computation, saw its market capitalization briefly surpass Microsoft to become the most-valuable company in the world before retreating slightly to occupy the second place.

While Nvidia is an obvious candidate, investors looking to invest in the AI trend should not place all their eggs in one basket. Fortunately, the AI tailwind should benefit many other companies beyond Nvidia -- and one of them is Palantir (NYSE: PLTR).

Image source: Getty Images.

Palantir has a sticky business model

If one were asked to name a top tech company, Palantir would unlikely be a top choice -- and for good reason. It's not a consumer tech-facing company like Amazon or Alphabet, or a small and medium-sized business-facing software company like Shopify. Palantir's primary customers are big organizations, mainly governments and massive corporations.

Founded in 2003, Palantir initially focused on building software for the U.S. government in counterterrorism operations. Its early success led to further expansion of its products to other governments globally. The company entered the commercial market at a later stage, leveraging its expertise and experience gained from serving government clients.

Palantir's value proposition to customers (where the majority are still governments) is relatively straightforward (though by no means easy to deliver). It helps them gather vast volumes of data from everywhere (internal and external), analyze the data with its software platform, and make critical operational decisions. Palantir's software tools must be robust, scalable, and reliable since they help clients make crucial decisions -- some of which are matters of life and death.

Besides, Palantir must tailor its software to match the needs of its customers. For instance, a local government agency will have completely different requirements from the defense department. So, while Palantir can leverage its common software platform and experience, it must tailor solutions to help various customers tackle their respective operations.

Given these reasons, Palantir's products can be highly sticky among its customers. The enormous financial and human resources needed to implement this software -- such as installation, integration, and training -- create a huge switching cost for clients. So long as the software continues to work, it makes little sense to consider switching providers.

Story continues

Also, Palantir usually enters into a long-term contract with clients, further improving its revenue stickiness. As of Dec. 31, 2023, existing contracts last 3.4 years, up from 2.8 years from the previous year. Moreover, existing customers usually spend more money with Palantir over time. For instance, the top-20 customers paid an average of $54.6 million in 2023, up 11% from $49.4 million a year earlier.

AI is set to propel Palantir's business in 2024 and beyond

Palantir's early track record in helping the U.S. government is an excellent springboard for it to build a massive business around government agencies. While impressive, this segment will unlikely propel Palantir to the next level. Instead, the software company must grow its commercial segment.

To put it into perspective, 55% of Palantir's 2023 revenue came from the government segment, with the remaining 45% from the commercial sector (up from 44 % in 2020). Herein lies a challenge: Palantir's ability to quickly scale its commercial segment further.

Don't get me wrong. There's nothing wrong with having a significant and robust government business, especially since many of these relationships are incredibly sticky. However, Palantir's largest opportunities lie in the commercial segment.

And that's where AI will play a significant role in shaping Palantir's next growth phase. In particular, the increase in awareness of AI, especially with the proliferation of generative AI apps like ChatGPT since 2023, has given the market a taste of what AI can do to their work and personal lives. This awareness raises the urgency for companies to implement the latest AI tools to improve their operations or risk losing to their competitors.

Palantir has multiple ways to win. One is that it can leverage its existing client relationships to upsell its AI solutions. This approach will be the most straightforward since customers have invested heavily in using Palantir's platform, so they can quickly run new AI models by leveraging existing data infrastructure.

On top of that, Palantir can leverage the near-term market excitement to recruit new customers. To this end, Palantir leverages its AIP Bootcamps to allow potential clients to try its AI platform for free, giving them a real taste of how AI can improve their business operations. So, customers get to see precisely what they can get out of the software without paying anything in advance, which should improve conversion rates.

While still early, there are already tangible signs that AI could be transformative for Palantir. For instance, Palantir's U.S. commercial revenue surged 40% year over year in the first quarter of 2024, and closed U.S. commercial deals jumped 94% year over year. Comparatively, companywide revenue rose by just 21%. Better still, this trend could continue for many years.

What it means for investors

Investors constantly seek the next megatrend which could shape society and generate massive wealth over long periods.

That's how Amazon, a young upstart from nowhere in the 1990s, became one of the most-valuable companies on the planet by leveraging the internet tailwind. That same tailwind led to the rise of tech companies like Alphabet and Meta Platform.

Similarly, AI would undoubtedly create new tech giants. Investors should, therefore, keep a watchlist of potential winners. Palantir should be on that list.

US stocks rose Monday, extending bullish momentum into the year's second half.

The 10-year Treasury yield spiked 13 basis points to 4.479%.

Investors are eyeing the Friday's upcoming jobs report to gauge where interest rates are headed.

US stocks ended higher on Monday to start the second half of the year, rising even as bond yields soared during the session.

Stocks wrapped up the first half of 2024 with strong gains, with the S&P 500 up 14% and Nasdaq Composite up 18%. Strength among tech stocks and investor confidence that the Federal Reserve will cut interest rates this year should keep the momentum going. However, fear has mounted around concentration in the market, as just a handful of stocks have been helping to drive the market to record highs.

Meanwhile, shifting outlooks on the US election have added uncertainty to the bond market, and yields on the 10-year Treasury surgedon Monday. After candidate Joe Biden and Donald Trump debated on Thursday, odds of a Trump win rose about 6 percentage points, Goldman Sachs reported. Traders were also assessing volatility stemming from European elections as right-wing candidates in France led in the first round of the general election.

The 10-year Treasury yield spiked 12 basis points to 4.469%.

Federal Reserve officials Jerome Powell and John Williams are scheduled to speak this week, setting the tone ahead of this month's policy meeting. However, investor attention will primarily be drawn to June's job report, scheduled to be released on Friday. Economists project 190,000 positions added last month, a cooldown from May.

Any surprises to expectations for jobs added last month could weigh on the Fed's future monetary policy. At present, markets expect rate cuts to start in November, CME FedWatch Tool data shows.

Yahoo Finance,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/intel-stock-down-141500452.html,2024-07-01,14:15:00 UTC,"Intel Stock Is Down, but Is It Also Out?","Intel (NASDAQ: INTC) is a stock that investors could easily dismiss. The longtime leader in the semiconductor industry has been eclipsed by Nvidia and AMD -- and amid the staggering costs of entering the foundry business, many investors have turned their backs on the chipmaker.

The good news for Intel is that artificial intelligence (AI) has led to a massive spike in semiconductor demand. This and the enormous government subsidies highlight why Intel stock should eventually return to growth. Plus, a largely overlooked factor should help ensure that success.

Intel's saving grace

Amid its entry into the foundry business, Intel may succeed simply because the government needs it to succeed. Here's why.

Currently, Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing (TSMC) is the leading chip producer, with about two-thirds of the world's semiconductor production taking place in Taiwan, according to TrendForce. This is gravely concerning to the U.S. government because of Taiwan's proximity to China and its longtime threats to invade the island.

Hence, the U.S. and other countries have offered tens of billions of dollars in subsidies to chipmakers like Intel to manufacture chips at home. Admittedly, Intel lags behind TSMC and Samsung technologically, and both of those companies are building foundries in the U.S.

Nonetheless, Intel has more foundries in the U.S. than any other company. Also, besides TSMC and Samsung, Intel is the only company buying the advanced equipment from ASML necessary to build the world's most advanced chips. The purchase of ASML's most advanced equipment is part of CEO Pat Gelsinger's effort to make Intel the technology leader in the chip industry again.

Intel's challenges

The company's plan to become the technological leader by next year is unlikely to come to pass. However, it has made improvements in an attempt to recover the lead it lost to longtime rival AMD.

Also, the company announced the Gaudi 3 Accelerator, an AI chip it hopes can compete with Nvidia. While Intel touts its advantages over Nvidia's Hopper H100 chip, Nvidia has already moved on to the Blackwell B200, likely ensuring that Nvidia will retain its technical lead.

Moreover, Intel will probably continue to struggle financially for the foreseeable future. While its first-quarter 2024 revenue of almost $13 billion rose 11% compared to the same quarter last year, free cash flow was negative $6.2 billion.That's because Intel spent almost $6 billion in Q1 on property and equipment. Since it claims only $21 billion in liquidity, it may have to issue more shares or additional debt if its financials do not improve.

Story continues

Still, amid a nearly 40% decline in the stock price since the beginning of the year, Intel stock has become a bargain in one critical measure -- the price-to-book value ratio. At just over 1.2 times book value, Intel stock is priced slightly above the value of its stockholders' equity.

In comparison, AMD sells at 4.6 times its book value, and Nvidia trades at a staggering price-to-book value ratio of 62. Hence, Intel's rock-bottom valuation could entice investors to buy Intel stock when one also considers its efforts to compete.

Investing in Intel

Ultimately, government backing and the desire to produce chips in the U.S. should become a tailwind for Intel stock. Admittedly, the company has fallen behind the peers it dominated in past decades.

However, Intel has shown that it will do what it takes to become one of the most advanced chip producers. Also, thanks to the U.S. government's desire for a homegrown chip manufacturing industry, Intel's foundry footprint may make its success critical to the U.S. government, increasing the likelihood it will win in the marketplace.

This means that even if Intel lags Nvidia in the AI chip space, its efforts to close the technological gap could improve its top line in the foreseeable future. With the market valuing the stock at little more than the value of its assets minus liabilities, patient, long-term investors could benefit by taking a position in Intel at current levels.

From alternative music and alternative cinema, millennials and Gen Z have moved on to alternative assets. And they're hoarding their way over the recommended amount. A mind-blowing 31% of their portfolios are in alternatives, which would make most financial advisors gasp for air. But are they right to do so?

Don't Miss:

Bank of America recently surveyed 1,000 Gen Z and millennial investors with over $3 million in assets, excluding primary residence. The results were starkly different from those of their older counterparts.

A striking 72% of investors aged 21 to 43 ""believe it is no longer possible to achieve above-average investment returns by investing solely in traditional stocks and bonds."" In contrast, only 28% of investors over 44 share this sentiment.

And the youth isn't just talking the talk: they allocate only 28% of their portfolios to stocks, compared to 55% for older investors. Instead, they are increasingly turning to alternative investments, which makes perfect sense from their perspective. How are you supposed to believe in the stability of stocks after they've crashed twice in your lifetime? First in 2000 and then in 2008. To them, investing your savings in something that can easily go away in a split second is only worth it if it comes with greater potential gains. That's where real estate, crypto, and private equity enter the picture.

Trending: Warren Buffett once said, ""If you don't find a way to make money while you sleep, you will work until you die."" These high-yield real estate notes that pay 7.5% – 9% make earning passive income easier than ever.

Real Estate — A Solid Foundation

Conventional investment categories include stocks, bonds, and cash, which makes real estate an alternative asset. With the volatility of the stock market, real estate offers a tangible asset that can provide stable returns over time. It has historically been one of the most secure ways to create wealth if you have the patience to wait for five to 10 years. Real estate investments can range from residential properties to commercial real estate, and investing in them has never been easier. By the end of the day, you can become a part-owner of individual properties through fractional investing or invest in funds that can net passive income for many years in the future.

Story continues

Crypto — The Digital Frontier

Another asset younger investors are bullish on is cryptocurrencies. Since the first Bitcoin was minted in 2008, the crypto market has grown exponentially, making everyone who bought thousands of the early digital coins very rich a few years later. Today, it continues to offer impressive returns, especially after wider adoption. Crypto is being increasingly used worldwide, which grants more stability and higher returns for those invested. Still, crypto markets are highly volatile, so it's important to educate yourself on the topic before you dive in. Luckily, most crypto exchanges offer free courses on what crypto is and what makes it 100x from time to time.

Private Equity — Tapping Into High-Growth Opportunities

Investing in private equity essentially means buying shares of startups before they go public. Today, they're taking longer than ever to become tradable, which makes them particularly attractive. Add to that the AI transformation and the fact hundreds of future billion-dollar companies have less than 10 employees today, and it becomes easy to see why private equity is extremely popular. However, most private companies aren't open to regular investors. They usually only rely on VC firms, hedge funds, and angel investors.

This can been seen in the performance of major sector exchange-traded funds (ETFs) such as the Alerian Energy Infrastructure ETF (NYSEMKT: ENFR), up about 18% year to date, and the Alerian MLP ETF (NYSEMKT: AMLP), up nearly 17%. The latter only includes the stocks of midstream companies structured as master limited partnerships (MLPs), while the former includes midstream companies structured as both MLPs and corporations.

While the first half of the year has been a good one for the sector, there is strong reason to believe a number of stocks in the space could be set to outperform in the second half and beyond.

Lets look at three midstream stocks set to outperform the rest of this year and into the future.

MPLX

MPLX (NYSE: MPLX) is a midstream company involved in logistics and storage as well as gathering and processing (G&P). Refiner Marathon Petroleum owns approximately 65% of the company and represents just under 50% of its revenue.

The stock sports an attractive 8% yield based on its most recent distribution and had a robust 1.6 times coverage ratio in the first quarter of 2024. Meanwhile, its balance sheet is in good shape with a leverage ratio (net debt/adjusted EBITDA) of just 3.2 times. The company has been a consistent performer, raising its base distribution each year since 2012.

The company is well positioned in both Appalachia (Marcellus and Utica) and the Permian, and has a robust pipeline of growth projects in both regions over the next few years. It is planning to spend $950 million in growth capital expenditure (capex) this year. The company also recently acquired some G&P assets in the Utica and entered into an agreement to merge the Whistler Pipeline and Rio Bravo Pipeline projects into a new joint venture in order to link Permian supply to additional Gulf Coast demand, which it believes will lead to future growth opportunities. <

Situated in the right basins, MPLX looks in good shape to continue growing its distributions, while its forward enterprise value (EV)-to-EBITDA (earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization) valuation of 9.6 times (one of the most common ways to value midstream stocks) is attractive and well below the 13.7 times multiple the sector traded at between 2011 to 2016.

Western Midstream

One of the best-performing midstream stocks in the first half of the year was Western Midstream (NYSE: WES), which was up around 35%. The company primarily services Occidental Petroleum's gathering and processing (G&P) needs in the Delaware Permian, Powder River Basin (PRB), and Denver-Julesburg (DJ) basins.

Story continues

The company started the year strong, recording record Q1 adjusted EBITDA of $609 million that was up 22%, while its free cash flow soared 60% to $225 million. This prompted Western to say it expected its adjusted EBITDA to come in at the high end of its previous guidance calling for full-year adjusted EBITDA of between $2.2 billion and $2.4 billion.

Impressively, the company increased its quarterly distribution by 52% from $0.575 per unit to $0.875. Based on this distribution, the stock now yields about 8.9%. Western appears on track to reach its leverage (net debt/adjusted EBITDA) goal of 3 times by year end, at which point it could pay out excess (special or variable) distributions above its current $0.875 quarterly based payout. That would likely help propel the stock even higher and set it up to continue to outperform.

Meanwhile, with a forward EV-to-EBITDA valuation of 9.6 times, the stock is trading at an attractive valuation that is well below historical levels.

Energy Transfer (ET)

One of the stocks best positioned to benefit from increasing power consumption stemming from artificial intelligence (AI), meanwhile, is Energy Transfer (NYSE: ET). The company has the largest integrated midstream system in the country with strong positions in low-cost natural gas-producing regions, particularly the Permian. As primarily a prolific oil-producing basin, the associated natural gas that comes from production in the Permian is some of the cheapest in the country, which is likely to draw many new data centers to the region given the immense energy that is needed to power AI.

Energy Transfer already has one of the most robust growth-project backlogs in the midstream space, with the company expecting to spend nearly $3 billion in growth capex this year. Projects related to AI energy consumption are only likely to increase that backlog in the future.

At the same time, the company has repaired its balance sheet to nicely lower its leverage, while carrying a high distribution-coverage ratio of over 2 times last quarter.

Trading at a forward EV/EBITDA ratio of just 7.4 times, Energy Transfer is a cheap stock with a lot of potential growth in front of it. That's why it is my favorite midstream stock to outperform in the second half of 2024 and beyond.

Yahoo Finance,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/2-artificial-intelligence-ai-stocks-220000723.html,2024-07-01,22:00:00 UTC,2 Artificial Intelligence (AI) Stocks Trading Under $30 That Can Supercharge Your Portfolio,"Semiconductor giant Nvidia has added $2.6 trillion to its market capitalization since the beginning of 2023, soaking up most of the value created by the artificial intelligence (AI) industry so far.

However, professional investor Cathie Wood believes software companies will eventually generate $8 in revenue for every $1 spent on chips from the likes of Nvidia, which could create a substantial opportunity for investors.

C3.ai (NYSE: AI) and Lemonade (NYSE: LMND) were developing AI software long before the hype took hold last year. Shares in both companies trade at under $30; here's why they could supercharge your stock portfolio over the long term.

1. C3.ai

C3.ai was the world's first enterprise AI company when it was founded in 2009. It now has a portfolio of more than 40 ready-made and customizable AI applications used by businesses in 19 different industries, which helps them reap the benefits of the technology without having to build it from the ground up themselves.

Dow is a chemical manufacturing giant that uses C3.ai's applications for predictive maintenance. AI monitors Dow's equipment to calculate the probability of a failure, allowing engineers to remedy any issues before they become critical. Dow says C3.ai has reduced its downtime by 20%, which directly impacts production volume, revenue, and profitability.

Similarly, Georgia Pacific (which manufactures paper, packaging, and building materials) has rolled out C3.ai's Reliability platform to monitor over 200 large production assets, with plans to expand the partnership further. Georgia Pacific has already seen a 5% increase in equipment efficiency, and management says employees now spend 80% of their time solving problems rather than looking for them.

C3.ai sells its applications directly to businesses, but it also sells them through its extensive partnership network which includes all major cloud platforms like Microsoft Azure and Amazon Web Services. Those partners offer C3.ai's applications to their customers to give them more AI options, and C3.ai gets the benefit of accessing a much larger pool of businesses.

In the recent fiscal 2024 fourth quarter (ended April 30), C3.ai had 487 customer engagements, which was a whopping 70% increase from the year-ago period, highlighting the fast-growing demand for AI in the corporate world. The company's revenue hit a record high of $86.6 million during the quarter, marking a 20% increase, its fastest growth in almost two years. According to management's forecast, revenue growth could accelerate further to 23% in the upcoming fiscal 2025 first quarter (ending July 31).

C3.ai trades at $28.55 per share as of the close on June 27, which is an 82% discount to its all-time high from the 2020 tech frenzy. Its valuation was completely unreasonable back then, but the company has grown consistently ever since, with more customers and an expanding product portfolio. Now might be a great time to buy in.

2. Lemonade

Lemonade has developed AI since it was founded in 2015 with an aim to disrupt the insurance industry, which is dominated by large, entrenched companies. Lemonade uses AI across its entire business; it autonomously writes quotes, pays claims, calculates premiums, and even identifies areas where the company is underperforming.

Lemonade's AI chatbot, Maya, can write quotes for potential customers in under 90 seconds via the company's website. Its AI bot, Jim, can pay claims in under three minutes without human assistance. That speedy, tech-centric approach to service helped Lemonade attract over 2 million customers so far, and it's successfully acquiring younger cohorts in the 19 to 34 age bracket, which have historically been underinsured.

Internally, Lemonade's Lifetime Value (LTV) AI models use swaths of data to calculate a customer's likelihood of making a claim, switching insurers, and buying multiple policies, to ensure it charges the most accurate premium.

Plus, those models help reduce costs. The company's loss-adjusted expense (LAE) ratio -- which measures the cost of managing claims -- is 7.6%, whereas 10% is typical across the industry. In fact, Lemonade's insurance book has grown 22% over the past year at the same time the company shrank its workforce by 11%, which highlights the power of AI.

During the first quarter of 2024 (ended March 31), Lemonade's in-force premiums (the total value of all active policies) hit a record high of $794 million, representing an increase of 21.5% from the year-ago period. Its gross loss ratio (the percentage of its premiums paid out as claims) also fell eight percentage points to 79% and is now in the ballpark of the company's long-term target of 75%.

Those metrics resulted in a record $119.1 million in revenue during Q1, up 25% from the year-ago period. Lemonade is still generating losses at the bottom line, but they are shrinking, and management expects the company to be cash-flow positive by the end of this year. However, pulling back on expenses could lead to slower revenue growth and delay an expansion beyond its five existing segments: renters, homeowners, life, pet, and car insurance.

Nevertheless, reaching profitability will be a key milestone that could give investors confidence in Lemonade's ability to operate a thriving, sustainable business over the long term. Its stock closed at $16.46 on June 27, which was an 89% discount to its all-time high. Like C3.ai, Lemonade was swept up in the tech frenzy during 2021, and its valuation soared to unsustainable heights. With the company making clear progress since then, the steep drop could be a great opportunity to buy the stock.

Yahoo Finance,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/world-most-volatile-big-stock-000000787.html,2024-07-02,00:00:00 UTC,World’s Most Volatile Big Stock Is Rocking Indonesia’s Market,"(Bloomberg) -- Its share-price chart resembles that of an emerging-market penny stock: a 1,200% surge punctuated by two crashes of more than 40% — all in the span of less than nine months.

Most Read from Bloomberg

But PT Barito Renewables Energy is Indonesia’s biggest company by market capitalization - an $85 billion geothermal power producer controlled by one of the country’s richest tycoons.

Barito’s wild swings – the most extreme among companies worldwide valued at $50 billion or more based on 30-day volatility – have perplexed professional analysts, stoked fevered trading among retail investors and challenged regulators’ attempts to bring more order to an increasingly volatile market.

The episode is offering a fresh reminder to international money managers on the lack of transparency that sometimes comes with investing in Indonesia’s $735 billion stock market. Barito has said little that might explain why its shares have swung so much, while authorities have refrained from disclosing specifics behind trading curbs implemented late May that critics say have exacerbated the stock’s volatility.

The trading restrictions “intended for investor protection ironically undermined broader investor confidence,” said Mohit Mirpuri, a fund manager at Singapore-based SGMC Capital Pte. “In the near term, this situation will likely deter risk-averse investors, especially if perceived as indicative of broader market instability or regulatory challenges.”

The controversy dates back to last June when the stock exchange launched a new watchlist for volatile and troubled companies. The board was envisioned as a carefully-crafted cure-all by regulators to return credibility to Southeast Asia’s largest stock market, which had been plagued by high volatility and shrinking liquidity. Under exchange rules, a company can be added to the watchlist for several reasons, including zero revenue growth, thin liquidity and trading under 51 rupiah for three months.

In March, the bourse amped up pressure on such companies by implementing a “full call auction” on all watchlist firms. The mechanism matches buy and sell orders, as is commonly used by major exchanges around the world during the start and close of trading. However, instead of transitioning to continuous trading, the auction would be implemented at four or five times through the day.

Story continues

At first, the restrictions were met with little fanfare. That is until the Indonesia Stock Exchange placed Barito Renewables on the list in late May, without offering any specific reasoning beyond citing the “significant increase” in the share price.

The response from the market was swift. In the subsequent two weeks, shares of the company tumbled by almost half, wiping out some 700 trillion rupiah ($43 billion) and dragging down the benchmark Jakarta Stock Exchange Composite Index by nearly 5%. The gyrations spurred FTSE Russell to delay the company’s inclusion into its large cap index that would have led to new foreign inflows.

The inclusion also angered local traders, who argued that it hurt market stability and dampened returns. In an act of defiance, they sent dozens of funeral flower arrangements to the exchange’s office, urging death to the auction. A petition on Change.org signed by 16,000 users is calling for its revocation.

The exchange has defended the restrictions, arguing that it has increased price discovery for several penny stocks and increased liquidity. Financial Services Authority Capital Market Supervisor Inarno Djajadi said the regulator is benchmarking its policies with similar rules in other countries.

Billionaire owner Prajogo Pangestu has since purchased some 48 million more shares, which had surged as much as 1,342% since its public market debut last October in one of the country’s most anticipated listings. The firm’s corporate secretary Merly said in a statement that Prajogo’s stake increase reflects his confidence in the firm’s prospects.

Late last month, after massive outcry, the regulator removed Barito Renewables from the watchlist without further explanation. Exchange Director Jeffrey Hendrik told reporters that the removal of a number of stocks was thanks to improved liquidity.

Barito Renewables only has one company analyst rating, according to Bloomberg data. The firm is majority-owned by PT Barito Pacific, which is majority-owned by Prajogo. It’s trading at 637 times 12-month forward earnings, more than three times Adani Green Energy Ltd. Earlier this year, Indonesia’s bourse checked on whether there was any stock manipulation in another firm owned by Prajogo that had surged more than 6,000% since listing.

Investors worry that entering the watchlist can create a knee-jerk reaction among traders. Four companies under MNC Group were placed onto the watchlist at the end of May, including PT MNC Asia Holding. That stock tumbled 60% in the two weeks after the placement. Shares of restaurant manager PT Sari Kreasi Boga plummeted nearly 70% within 3 weeks of inclusion in the same month.

“Once shares enter the (full call auction), it’s like being in a dark prison, so people are in panic selling,” said Hasan Zein Mahmud, a former director of the exchange and investor in Sari Kreasi.

Analysts say the uncertainty will accelerate an exodus of foreign capital. Broad macro concerns about uncertain fiscal policy and a weak rupiah have already prompted Morgan Stanley and HSBC Holdings Plc to downgrade the country’s stocks last month.

“The (full call auction) rule might be beneficial for small, penny stocks. But large ones like Barito, it may actually deter investors, especially foreign funds given the less transparent and market-driven process,” said Sufianti, an analyst at Bloomberg Intelligence.

Yahoo Finance,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/nvidia-stock-cross-1-000-120955752.html,2024-07-01,12:09:55 UTC,"Can Nvidia Stock Cross $1,000 Again After the Stock Split?","Nvidia's (NASDAQ: NVDA) stock popped up by a dramatic 500% in the past three years. Undoubtedly, much of this recent rally has been fueled by the company's position as a key beneficiary and enabler of the ongoing artificial intelligence (AI) wave.

Nvidia offers a full-stack AI platform, comprising cutting-edge AI-optimized hardware chips, a complete software ecosystem, high-speed networking solutions, and servers to enable clients to build ""AI factories,"" or the essential infrastructure for AI-based outputs (text, images, audio, video). The company's accelerated product release cadence, from two years to one year, also helps it maintain technological superiority against competition.

Furthermore, besides the booming demand from large hyperscale companies, enterprises, and AI start-ups, Nvidia's AI-optimized hardware and software solutions are now increasingly used in new areas such as Sovereign AI (governments building domestic AI capabilities), automotive vertical, and robotics business.

The AI frenzy propelled Nvidia's stock to an all-time high of over $1,200 in early June. Its recently executed 10-for-1 stock split made its stock far more accessible to retail investors.

With Nvidia's stock now around $124 at this writing, long-term investors may be keen to know if the stock can again jump to $1,000-plus levels. Let's analyze the company's fundamentals and valuations to find some answers.

Intensifying competition and supply challenges

Nvidia's technological superiority in developing AI-optimized hardware and software enabled the company to capture a whopping 90% share of the global AI chip market. However, the company's stronghold may get challenged in the long run. Although currently far behind Nvidia, competitors Advanced Micro Devices and Intel are working hard to capture a slice of the AI market.

AMD's MI300 family of data center chips witnessed strong demand, while the company is also gearing up for launching families of AI chips such as MI325 and MI350 accelerators, based on advanced architectures, in the coming months. AMD expects these chips to demonstrate faster performance, improved memory capacity, and stronger computing capabilities for AI workloads.

Intel is also aggressively focusing on the AI PC opportunity and hopes to launch Lunar Lake laptop CPUs by September 2024. Lunar Lake chips are expected to be superior in performance, efficiency, and graphics processing compared to their predecessor Meteor Lake chips. Plus, Intel has also introduced Gaudi 3 AI accelerators, offering superior cost-performance benefits for training and inferencing of AI models.

Story continues

Nvidia also faces the risk of customers such as cloud players and technology giants becoming competitors, as they have been accelerating in-house development of AI-optimized chips and solutions. This risk cannot be ignored, since large cloud players account for roughly 45% of the company's data center revenues.

Multiple other challenges

While demand for Nvidia's AI chips and solutions has grown dramatically, the company continues to face supply constraints associated with procuring manufacturing, testing, and packaging capacity from Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing and other vendors. Subsequently, the company expects demand for its new H200 chips and next-generation Blackwell chips to outpace supply well until 2025. This headwind can affect the company's growth prospects in the coming years.

Nvidia also accelerated the pace of release cadence (for major products or features) from once every two years to once annually. Continuously innovating and adapting hardware and software is the need of the hour in the face of increasing complexity and rapid evolution of AI models and workloads.

However, this also exposes Nvidia to significant execution risks and to the risk of clients delaying purchases to get access to the most advanced technologies. Nvidia's rapid pace of innovation can result in early product obsolescence for its older offerings and increasing risk of self-cannibalization.

Valuation estimates

Nvidia has consistently posting impressive financial metrics for the past several quarters. In the first quarter of fiscal 2025 (ending April 28), revenues were up by nearly 262% year over year to $26 billion, while net income soared by 628% year over year to $14.9 billion.

Analysts expect Nvidia's fiscal 2025 sales to grow by 97% year over year to $120 billion. While the revenue growth rate is expected to moderate in the next decade, analysts expect the company's sales to more than triple to $380.9 billion by 2034.

Nvidia is currently trading at a price-to-sales (P/S) multiple of 38.6x. Assuming that this multiple reverts to its 10-year average of 22.27x (a conservative estimate), we can expect Nvidia's market capitalization to reach around $8.5 trillion by 2034. While the market cap seems huge, it is only 2.7 times the company's current $3.1 trillion market capitalization. This implies that the stock can reach north of $340 by 2034 (assuming no significant share repurchases or stock splits).

Assuming Nvidia's P/S multiple remains at the current 38.6x level (a very aggressive estimate), the company's market capitalization will be around $14.7 trillion -- 4.7 times its current market capitalization. Still, the company's share price can be expected to reach close to $600 by the end of 2034.

Hence, based on current estimates, the chances of Nvidia's share price crossing $1,000 in the next decade appear slim. These projections, however, can change in case Nvidia makes even more dramatic advances in AI technologies in the coming years.

WTI, the US benchmark price, peaked above $90 at the end of September and fell just below $70 in December. Currently, it’s at $82 per barrel, a high price that is a boon to an industry that is also generating record-level production. The IEA is predicting that, by 2030, crude oil production in the US will increase by 2.1 million barrels per day over last year’s baseline.

Additionally, the high-demand environment for energy, especially as the summer driving season intensifies, creates a favorable scenario for investing in energy stocks. Share prices have declined alongside the dip in crude oil prices, presenting investors with an opportunity to buy into a sector with attractive valuations and solid near-term prospects.

This has Stephens analyst Michael Scialla recommending energy stocks. He’s forecasting solid upside potential, up to ~46% in one case, for two names in particular. We’ve used the TipRanks platform to look up the broader take on Scialla’s picks. Here they are, along with the analyst’s comments.

SM Energy Company (SM)

The first stock on our list is SM Energy, an independent exploration and production firm in the oil and gas sector. This firm, based in Denver, Colorado, traces its roots back more than a century and focuses on the acquisition and development of high-quality energy assets across the ‘lower 48.’ Currently, SM’s main operational assets are in Texas, where the company holds a net-acre position of ~111,000 in the famous Midland Basin in the western part of the state and another ~155,000 net acres in the Eagle Ford and Austin Chalk formations to the south. SM’s assets include crude oil, natural gas, and natural gas liquids.

Compared to its peers, SM’s holdings are not the largest – but the company has focused on acquiring top-tier assets, with the aim of maximizing value through applying the latest in hydrocarbon extraction technologies. The company had 1,323 net producing wells at the end of 2023, generating 152 Mboe/d in average net production. SM’s proven reserves, as of the end of last year, came to approximately 605 MMBoe. These reserves broke down to 38% crude oil, 42% natural gas, and 20% natural gas liquids.

In its last quarterly results, reported for 1Q24, SM reported a total top line of $559.9 million. This was down 2.4% year-over-year, but it beat the forecast by just over $3.2 million. At the bottom line, the company’s non-GAAP earnings came to $1.41 per share. Not only did this beat expectations by 13 cents per share, it was up from the $1.33 reported in the prior-year quarter.

Story continues

SM’s success in developing high-end production numbers from its assets was the trigger that caught analyst Scialla’s eye. The Stephens energy expert writes of this company, “An early mover in identifying and developing core assets in areas that industry previously deemed non-core, SM offers investors differentiated option value as it pushes the boundaries of resource plays in the Midland Basin and South Texas. SM’s Rockstar acreage in Howard County, which was believed to be located east of the Midland Basin core when the company acquired it in 2016 and 2017, has yielded some of the most prolific oil producers in the play over the past 5 years.”

The analyst goes on to outline this company’s potential for solid returns going forward, saying of it, “With ~40% of the production mix in the form of natural gas and more than 85% of next year’s projected output unhedged, SM has meaningful exposure to a potential rebound in 2025 natural gas prices. In addition, an under-leveraged balance sheet positions the company to ramp returns to investors, in our view.”

For Scialla, this stance backs up an Overweight (Buy) rating on SM, complemented by a $63 price target suggesting a 46% one-year upside potential. (To watch Scialla’s track record, click here)

Overall, SM Energy gets a Moderate Buy consensus rating from the Street, based on 12 recent analyst reviews that include 7 Buys and 5 Holds. The shares are priced at $43.23 and their $58.58 average target price implies a gain of 35.5% in the next 12 months. (See SM stock forecast)

Matador Resources Company (MTDR)

The second company we’ll look at, Matador Resources, is another player in the oil and gas exploration and production sector. Matador acquires energy assets in the US, with a particular focus on oil and natural gas shale formations – the same formations that brought us the fracking revolution earlier this century – along with other unconventional energy plays. Currently, Matador has active operations in three main areas: the Wolfcamp and Bone Spring plays of the Delaware Basin straddling the New Mexico/West Texas border; the Eagle Ford shale of South Texas; and the Haynesville shale and Cotton Valley energy plays in the northwest of Louisiana.

As a business strategy, Matador has focused on unconventional energy plays, using high-efficiency methods to maximize the extraction of hydrocarbon resources from these assets. In addition to operational efficiencies, Matador follows disciplined financial practices to maintain a strong balance sheet to ensure that both equity and debt capital serve the larger purpose of cost-efficient operations.

Matador’s operational execution exceeded the high end of guidance in the company’s 1Q24 report. Total production was reported as 149,760 Boe per day, compared to the top-end guidance number of 146,500 Boe/d. Of this, 84,777 barrels per day was oil production, and 389.9 MMcf per day was natural gas. The guidance numbers for oil and gas were 84,000 and 375 at the top ends.

Beating the forecast on production led to beating the forecast on revenues and earnings. Matador’s top line came to $787.7 million, more than $46 million over the estimates – and more than 40% better than the year-ago figure. Matador reported a non-GAAP earnings-per-share of $1.71, up from $1.50 in 1Q23 and 18 cents per share over expectations.

Scialla, in his coverage of Matador, is appreciative of the company’s strategy, particularly how it targets robust production from a low cost of operations. He says, “A pioneer in the Northern Delaware Basin, MTDR offers investors differentiated organic growth from a robust, low-cost drilling inventory. We forecast 2024 organic production growth of 19% y/y versus our midcap peer average of 3%. The company’s ‘brick-by-brick’ approach to building its land position is a core tenet of its value proposition and contributes to its strong margins. MTDR’s 2024 CF/Boe and FCF/Boe estimates are among the best in our mid-cap peer group.”

Based on this stance, Scialla rates MTDR as Overweight (i.e. Buy). He sets a price target of $83, showing his confidence in a 39% upside for the year ahead.

Matador’s dozen recent analyst ratings include 11 to Buy and 1 to Hold, for a Strong Buy consensus rating. The shares are priced at $59.60 and their $80.33 average price target implies that the stock has a one-year gain of 35% in store. (See MTDR stock forecast)

Most Read from Bloomberg

The move came as Microsoft shares rose to a fresh record, bringing their total gain this year to 21%. The company, through its partnership with OpenAI, has been one of the biggest beneficiaries of the artificial intelligence rally that has powered the US stock market higher.

More than 90% of Ballmer’s $157.2 billion net worth is in Microsoft shares, according to the Bloomberg Billionaires Index. Gates, meanwhile, has diversified his $156.7 billion fortune: About half his wealth is held through Cascade Investment, which was created with the proceeds of Microsoft stock sales and dividends. He also owns a $21 billion stake in waste-management company Republic Services Inc. through Cascade.

Gates, 68, has been slowly reducing his fortune through philanthropy. Along with his ex-wife Melinda French Gates and his friend Warren Buffett, Gates has funneled billions of dollars of his personal money to build up the $75 billion Gates Foundation, one of the biggest charitable organizations in the world.

Since they started the foundation more than two decades ago, Gates and his former wife have given almost $60 billion from their personal fortunes. French Gates recently stepped down as co-chair of the foundation and received $12.5 billion to use for her own charitable purposes.

In 2010, Gates, French Gates and Buffett also founded the Giving Pledge, an organization that encourages the world’s richest people to give away the majority of their fortunes in their lifetimes or their wills. Ballmer, 68, who has not signed the Giving Pledge, has his own philanthropic work but nowhere on the scale of Gates.

Gates founded Microsoft with his friend Paul Allen in 1975 and led it until 2000, when Ballmer — one of the company’s earliest employees — replaced him as CEO. Ballmer retired in 2014 and became Microsoft’s largest shareholder that same year. He bought the NBA’s Los Angeles Clippers for $2 billion in 2014, an investment that is estimated to be worth $4.6 billion today.

In 2010, Gates, French Gates and Buffett also founded the Giving Pledge, an organization that encourages the world’s richest people to give away the majority of their fortunes in their lifetimes or their wills.","['microsoft', 'foundation', 'stock', 'shares', 'french', 'gates', 'richer', 'billionaires', 'bloomberg', 'billion', 'ballmer', 'worth']",https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/zeyuucP6lpoan.Af.tHI4A--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTEyMDA7aD04MDA-/https://media.zenfs.com/en/bloomberg_technology_68/503c9608916597618eda9b01fa3c51fd,

During the 2023 Daily Journal shareholder meeting, Munger responded to a question from CNBC's Becky Quick about the trend of large companies, including Meta, opting for self-insurance against various liabilities. Quickly inquired about the potential systemic issues this trend could cause and sought Munger's thoughts.

Don't Miss:

Are you rich? Here’s what Americans think you need to be considered wealthy.

Warren Buffett once said, ""If you don't find a way to make money while you sleep, you will work until you die."" Here's how you can collect passive rental income without being a landlord.

Known for his straightforward approach, Munger shared his personal philosophy on self-insurance. He said, ""In my own life, I'm a big self-insurer and so is Warren. It's ridiculous to carry fire insurance on my houses because I can so easily rebuild a house that would burn down. So why would I want to bother fooling around with the claims process and all kinds of things?""

He emphasized the practicality of self-insuring for those who can afford it, noting, ""If insurance, you should insure against things you can't afford to pay for yourself. But if you can afford to take the bumps, you know, some unusual expense coming along doesn't really hurt you that much. Why would you want to fool around with some insurance company? If your house burned down, I would just write a check and rebuild it.""

Munger argued that all intelligent people are self-insured. He then clarified, maybe not ""all,"" but said, ""All intelligent people should do it my way,"" highlighting the waste and fraud often associated with traditional insurance. ""There should be way more self-insurance in life. There's a lot of waste you're paying when you buy insurance for the other fellow's frauds, and there's a lot of fraud in life."" He explained that if you can afford to take the risk yourself, you should, but there is a risk involved.

It may be easy for a Munger to rebuild a home, considering his net worth was $2.6 billion during the interview. However, for the average person, this would be an extreme hardship. There is also the liability factor involved if something were to occur on your property, causing injury to another.

Trending: Elon Musk and Jeff Bezos are bullish on one city that could dethrone New York and become the new financial capital of the US. Investing in its booming real estate market has never been more accessible.

Berkshire Hathaway, the conglomerate where Munger served as vice chairman, has substantial interests in the insurance industry. The company owns several major insurance subsidiaries, including GEICO, Berkshire Hathaway Reinsurance Group, and Berkshire Hathaway Primary Group. These insurance operations have been a core part of Berkshire Hathaway's financial success, making Munger's advice particularly notable given the company's deep involvement in the sector.

Story continues

Despite his role at Berkshire Hathaway, a company deeply invested in the insurance industry, Munger maintained his candid stance. ""I'd rather tell it the way it is and tell it in a way that helps Berkshire. I'm not going to tell it differently than I think it really is just because it's better for Berkshire. Even though it's bad for Berkshire, I want to tell you, if you can afford to self-insure, self-insure.""

Munger's advice comes when a growing number of American homeowners opt to go without insurance, not because they can afford to self-insure like Munger, but due to rising costs. A recent study by the Insurance Information Institute found that 12% of Americans no longer have home insurance, up from 5% in 2019. This surge in uninsured homeowners is the highest the industry has seen, driven by the rising coverage costs.

Self-insurance may offer savings and simplicity, but it carries significant risks. For many, it might not be a viable option without a thorough understanding of their financial situation. Consulting a financial advisor can help assess whether self-insurance is feasible and advisable.

(Reuters) -BlackRock has launched a 'buffer' exchange-traded fund that seeks to offer a 100% downside hedge to risk-shy investors looking to tap the equity markets, the world's largest asset manager said on Monday.

So-called buffer or risk-managed ETFs help maximize returns from an asset for investors and simultaneously provide downside protection over a specific period.

The novel product will likely appeal to investors who are hoping to ride a rally in the stock markets as they continue to trade near record highs, but are concerned that a slowing economy and higher-for-longer interest rates can together hurt sentiment going forward.

Buffer ETFs also typically see lower redemption requests during times of heavy market volatility.

""BlackRock is not early - and actually is a little late - to the buffered ETF game, but with (the company's) size, reach, and marketing machine, it has a fair chance of catching up with and surpassing earlier market entrants,"" said Michael Ashley Schulman, partner and CIO at Running Point Capital Advisors.

""Launching buffered ETFs now, when the market is near all-time highs and many investors are nervous - especially with inflation, upcoming elections, and expanding debt - could be especially fortuitous for them,"" he added.

The iShares Large Cap Max Buffer Jun ETF started trading on Monday under the ticker symbol 'MAXJ'.

The asset manager said the ETF will track the returns of the benchmark S&P 500 using options with an upside cap, while providing a 100% hedge to all downside for roughly a year.

""With record levels of cash sitting on the sidelines, many investors are looking for tools to help navigate market volatility before they step back into the market,"" said Rachel Aguirre, head of U.S. iShares product, BlackRock.

BlackRock added that it now manages $25 billion in assets under management across more than 40 active ETFs in the United States, as of June 30.

The aggressive growth investor who's also the co-founder, CEO, and ace stock picker at Ark Invest enjoys swinging the fences. She's also not afraid to go for the safe single, binge-buying some of her favorite holdings over and over again.

She publishes Ark Invest's transactions at the end of every market day. Something out of the ordinary happened on Friday night, as she announced her purchases from earlier in the day. PagerDuty (NYSE: PD) was one of the six existing positions that she added to on Friday. More importantly, she bought shares of the cloud-based provider of enterprise analytics and uptime monitoring solutions every single trading day in June. She obviously likes PagerDuty right now. Should you? Let's take a closer look.

Reporting for duty

Enterprise software companies are all about making businesses more efficient, and that's what PagerDuty's growing suite of offerings aims to accomplish. From automation tools that help increase task completion speeds and lower support costs to its incident management platform that allows clients to navigate through hiccups and come out of disruptions even smarter, PagerDuty's ambitious isn't on trial.

Growth has been the problem, particularly given its recent run of slowing top-line gains. Year-over-year revenue growth has decelerated for seven consecutive financial reports, from a starting point of 34% down to just 8% nearly two years later.

Q2 2023: 34%

Q3 2023: 31%

Q4 2023: 29%

Q1 2024: 21%

Q2 2024: 19%

Q3 2024: 15%

Q4 2024: 10%

Q1 2025: 8%

PagerDuty's dollar-based net retention rate has disintegrated from 116% to 106% over the past year, and its paid customers count has stalled around 15,100 in that time. The bottom line has also been problematic. It has never turned a profit on a reported basis, and analysts don't see that changing anytime soon. It did announce a small round of layoffs earlier this year, but it remains to be seen if the cost controls will pay off without sacrificing a potential return to top-line growth.

Knocking on Wood

Cathie Wood naturally has a more upbeat read on PagerDuty than the downward sloping fundamentals. She has been buying a piece of PagerDuty every trading day since May 31. Despite the recent daily trickle of purchases, it remains one of the smallest positions across the combined holdings of Ark Invest's exchange-traded funds.

She's not the only one who was buying. Shares of PagerDuty soared 21% last month.

There are some reasons to be upbeat about PagerDuty's near-term prospects. For starters, despite the single-digit revenue growth that PagerDuty posted in its latest quarter, Wall Street pros see it returning to double-digit revenue gains for the entire fiscal year and accelerating in each of the next two years.

Story continues

Profitability on an adjusted basis is also expected to climb 14% next year and another 24% in fiscal 2027. This prices PagerDuty stock at 23 times that fiscal year's adjusted earnings, but it has also posted double-digit percentage beats in each of the past four reports.

The naysayers are still plentiful, and that's not necessarily a bad thing. Nearly 12% of PagerDuty's shares are currently being sold short, approaching the all-time high it notched earlier this year. In the right environment, even a modest bullish catalyst can send the boo-birds scrambling for cover, and the short squeeze would theoretically push the stock higher.

Sentiment could be turning after a buoyant June. Chad Bennett at Craig-Hallum upgraded the stock last week, rallying around the potential for revenue gains to accelerate after bottoming out in the fiscal first quarter. His new $30 price target implies another 31% of upside in the shares. A reignited PagerDuty should result in either the resumption of customer growth or a reversal in the retreat of its dollar-based net retention rate. In an ideal world it would be a little bit of both leading the charge, and PagerDuty reaching reported profitability sooner than expected. For now, a once out-of-favor software-as-a-service company -- or SaaS stock -- is starting to court believers. Wood seems to have the right idea when it comes to buying PagerDuty this summer.

Part of retirement planning includes determining how much to save and invest so you can enjoy the type of lifestyle you desire. Setting your savings target by age can be a good way to organize your strategy and gauge how to track progress with your goals. You might also be interested in how much the typical retiree has saved at age 65, 70 and beyond. In this article, we’re going to focus on how much the average person has saved and possibly should have saved at the age of 70. Keep in mind, though, that your situation is still completely unique to what your goals are. You may want to work with a financial advisor to make sure your savings goals are in line with where you need to be later on.

How Much Does the Average 70-Year-Old Have in Savings?

According to data from the Federal Reserve’s most recent Survey of Consumer Finances, the average 65 to 74-year-old has a little over $426,000 saved. That’s money that’s specifically set aside in retirement accounts, including 401(k) plans and IRAs.

The Federal Reserve also measures median and mean (average) savings across other types of financial assets. According to the data, the average 70-year-old has approximately:

$60,000 in transaction accounts (including checking and savings)

$127,000 in certificate of deposit (CD) accounts

$17,000 in savings bonds

$43,000 in cash value life insurance

In terms of overall trends, the numbers show an increase over the previous Survey of Consumer Finances. According to that survey, the average 65 to 75-year-old had $381,000 saved for retirement in 2016. That figure, however, was well below the $486,000 70-year-olds had saved on average in 2013.

Whether the Survey of Consumer Finances for 2022 shows an uptick in savings or a decline remains to be seen. While Social Security benefits have seen several cost-of-living increases since the last survey was completed, persistently high inflation has put more pressure on Americans’ spending power. The survey may show that 70-year-olds have less in retirement savings if they’re spending more to compensate for higher prices.

If you’re ready to be matched with local advisors that can help you achieve your financial goals, get started now .

How Much Should a 70-Year-Old Have in Savings?

Financial experts generally recommend saving anywhere from $1 million to $2 million for retirement. If you consider an average retirement savings of $426,000 for those in the 65 to 74-year-old range, the numbers obviously don’t match up.

The amount a 70-year-old should save for retirement can depend on several things, including:

Story continues

Desired retirement lifestyle

When they apply for Social Security benefits

Other sources of retirement income, such as a 401(k), IRA, pension or annuity

Other savings, including taxable brokerage accounts, savings accounts and CDs

Overall health and life expectancy

The more money you anticipate spending to cover your cost of living in retirement, the more you’ll typically need to save. Social Security benefits are a staple part of many retirees’ income picture, but those payments may only go so far. Pensions, meanwhile, are becoming more of a rarity as employers opt for defined contribution plans instead.

Long-term care can put a strain on retiree budgets and increase the amount of money you need to save. Medicare doesn’t cover long-term care though Medicaid does. But to qualify for Medicaid, you’ll typically need to spend down your assets. Purchasing long-term care insurance can be a workaround so you’re not at risk of draining your savings.

What Is a Good Net Worth at 70?

how much does the average 70-year-old have in savings

Net worth is a measure of your assets vs. your liabilities. In other words, it’s the difference between what you own and what you owe.

The average net worth of Americans aged 65 to 74 hovers around $1.2 million. The median net worth is lower, at $164,000. The typical 70-year-old has around $105,000 in debt, including mortgages, home equity loans, credit cards and student loans, as measured by the Fed’s data.

What constitutes a good net worth is situation-specific and largely linked to your retirement goals. There are different rules of thumb you can apply to come up with an ideal net worth calculation. For example, one rule suggests having a net worth at 70 that’s equivalent to 20 times your annual expenses.

If you spend $100,000 a year to live in retirement, you should have a net worth of at least $2 million. On the other hand, if you only spend $40,000 on living expenses, then your target net worth would be much lower, at $800,000.

Is Retiring at 70 a Good Idea?

Whether it makes sense to retire at 70 can depend on your finances and what you envision for your dream retirement. When choosing a retirement age, it’s helpful to consider:

When you’ll really need to take Social Security benefits

Whether you’ll still work in a part-time capacity after retiring

How long you plan to live in retirement

Your desired savings goal and current savings rate

If you can delay taking Social Security benefits until age 70, that can boost your benefit amount. You’ll be eligible to collect 132% of your benefit amount by waiting longer to apply.

You can also continue saving and investing for retirement if you’re working longer. For example, you can continue maxing out your 401(k) each year, or at the very least, contribute enough to get your full employer match. You can also funnel money into an IRA for supplemental savings.

Retiring at 70 means you’ll have a two-year gap before you’ll need to begin taking required minimum distributions (RMDs) from a traditional 401(k). You’ll also need to take RMDs if you have a Roth 401(k), but Roth IRAs are exempt from this rule.

Within that window, you might decide to convert your traditional IRA to a Roth account. Doing so can mean a higher tax bill in the year of the conversion since you’re required to pay taxes on your traditional IRA earnings. But moving forward, you’d be able to take tax-free distributions from your Roth IRA.

The Bottom Line

how much does the average 70-year-old have in savings

How much does the average 70-year-old have in savings? Just shy of $500,000, according to the Federal Reserve. The better question, however, may be whether that’s enough for a 70-year-old to live on in retirement so that you can align your budget accordingly. With no end to higher inflation in sight, retiring on $500,000 may not be realistic for everyone. The good news is that the younger you are, the more time you have to plan, save and invest for the future.

Retirement Planning Tips

Consider talking to your financial advisor about the pros and cons of retiring at 70 and what your personal timeline for retirement should look like. If you don’t have a financial advisor yet, finding one doesn’t have to be hard. SmartAsset’s free tool matches you with up to three financial advisors who serve your area, and you can interview your advisor matches at no cost to decide which one is right for you. If you’re ready to find an advisor who can help you achieve your financial goals, get started now.

Delaying Social Security benefits could help you to collect more money in retirement. Taking benefits early, however, could reduce your monthly payment amount. The earliest you can begin taking Social Security is age 62 but it may benefit you to wait until at least your full retirement age to apply. Also, keep in mind that if you do decide to take Social Security early and you continue to work, your benefit amount may be reduced even further. Understanding how to maximize Social Security benefits can help you get the most money possible.

Keep an emergency fund on hand in case you run into unexpected expenses. An emergency fund should be liquid — in an account that isn't at risk of significant fluctuation like the stock market. The tradeoff is that the value of liquid cash can be eroded by inflation. But a high-interest account allows you to earn compound interest. Compare savings accounts from these banks.

Yahoo Finance,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/3-warren-buffett-stocks-screaming-092100428.html,2024-07-01,09:21:00 UTC,3 Warren Buffett Stocks That Are Screaming Buys for the Second Half of 2024 (and Beyond),"If you've ever wondered why Berkshire Hathaway (NYSE: BRK.A)(NYSE: BRK.B) CEO Warren Buffett draws in the neighborhood of 40,000 investors to his company's shareholder meeting each year, look no further than his track record. Since taking over the CEO role in the mid-1960s, the ""Oracle of Omaha"" has overseen a nearly 4,964,000% return in his company's Class A shares (BRK.A), which compares quite favorably to the roughly 36,000% total return, including dividends paid, for the broad-based S&P 500 over the same span.

For nearly six decades, Buffett and his top-notch investment team have had a knack for picking out time-tested bargains hiding in plain sight.

At the moment, Berkshire has stakes in 44 stocks and two exchange-traded funds spanning $388 billion of invested assets. But among these holdings are three Warren Buffett stocks that represent screaming buys for the second half of 2024, and likely well beyond.

Amazon

The first Warren Buffett stock that stands out for all the right reasons for the second half of 2024 and well beyond is e-commerce leader Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN).

The knock against Amazon has always been its relatively ""expensive"" valuation, at least when using traditional fundamental metrics, such as the price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio. While the time-tested P/E ratio works great when attempting to value mature businesses, this go-to metric tends to come up short when analyzing fast-growing companies that are regularly reinvesting their cash flow back into their operations.

Chances are that you're familiar with Amazon because of its superior e-commerce platform. In 2023, Amazon is estimated to have garnered a nearly 38% share of U.S. online retail sales. While this would, in theory, expose the company to weakness if the U.S. or global economy were to fall into a recession, the important thing to recognize about Amazon is that its operating cash flow and income almost exclusively originate from its faster-growing ancillary operations.

For investors, nothing is more important than Amazon Web Services (AWS). AWS is the world's leading cloud infrastructure service platform, and it recently surpassed $100 billion in annualized run-rate sales. What's noteworthy about this psychological run-rate revenue milestone is that businesses are still in the relatively early stages of ramping up their cloud-service spending. Since cloud-service margins are considerably juicier than the margins associated with online retail sales, AWS is typically responsible for 50% to 100% of Amazon's operating income.

Story continues

Beyond AWS, Amazon is also relying on advertising services and subscription services to do some heavy lifting. Amazon draws around 2.5 billion unique visitors to its site each month, which is more than eyeballs enough to attract advertisers.

Meanwhile, the company surpassed 200 million global Prime subscribers in April 2021 and has likely added to this total as its content library and e-commerce platform have grown. Like AWS, advertising services and subscription services offer sustained double-digit sales growth.

Despite recently hitting a new all-time high, Amazon is historically cheap relative to cash flow projections. Throughout the 2010s, investors regularly paid 23 to 37 times year-end cash flow to own shares of Amazon. You can buy shares right now for about 13 times estimated cash flow per share in 2025.

Chevron

A second no-brainer Warren Buffett stock that's begging to be bought for the second half of 2024 (and beyond) is global energy giant Chevron (NYSE: CVX).

The clearest headwind current and prospective Chevron shareholders have to contend with is the prospect of a recession taking shape in the U.S. or abroad. Oil and gas stocks tend to ebb-and-flow with the spot price of crude oil and natural gas. During periods of economic weakness, it's not uncommon for commodity-driven companies to struggle.

The good news for Chevron is that macro factors are decisively working in its favor. Even with select predictive indicators cautioning of a coming recession -- e.g., the first drop off in U.S. M2 money supply since the Great Depression -- the U.S. economy has remained resilient.

To add to this point, the unprecedented demand uncertainty associated with the COVID-19 pandemic led global energy majors (including Chevron) to scale back their capital expenditures (capex) for a good three years. Even with capex ramping back up, the global supply of crude oil has been constrained. When the supply of an in-demand good is tight, it tends to have a positive effect on the spot price of that good. In simpler terms, it's buoying the price of oil, which in turn is generating more operating cash flow for Chevron's drilling segment.

Perhaps one of the biggest catalysts for the second half of 2024 and into 2025 is Chevron's pending deal to acquire Hess in an all-share transaction valued at $53 billion. If this buyout gets the green light from regulators, Chevron is going to add 465,000 net acres in the oil-rich Bakken Shale, as well as meaningfully increase its oil-equivalent exposure in Guyana. If the price of oil remains elevated, it makes this deal all the sweeter.

Although drilling is where Chevron derives its best margins, don't overlook that it's also an integrated operator. The company's transmission pipelines, refineries, and chemical plants act as a hedge in the event that the spot price of crude oil declines. The steady operating cash flow from these ancillary operating segments has played a key role in Chevron being able to increase its base annual dividend for 37 consecutive years.

The icing on the cake is that Chevron's stock is, also, historically inexpensive. Shares can be grabbed right now for less than 11 times forward-year earnings, which represents a 23% discount to its average forward-year multiple over the trailing-five-year period.

Coca-Cola

The third Warren Buffett stock that's a screaming buy for the second half of 2024, and likely well beyond, is beverage behemoth Coca-Cola (NYSE: KO).

Whereas an economic downturn is arguably the biggest enemy for Amazon and Chevron, the prospect of above-average inflation is typically viewed as the most front-and-center headwind for consumer staples companies. When the price of goods and services is rising at an above-average rate, there's always a concern that consumers may be forced to pare back their spending.

The good news for Coca-Cola is that it provides a basic necessity product. Regardless of what's happening with the U.S. economy or Wall Street, consumers are still going to purchase beverages. Given the company's strong branding, Coca-Cola rarely has any trouble increasing its prices to offset rising expenses.

Speaking of strong branding, Coca-Cola was named the ""most-chosen brand"" by consumers for a 12th straight year in Kantar's latest ""Brand Footprint"" report. This dominance is a reflection of Coca-Cola's top-tier marketing campaign, which involves using digital channels and artificial intelligence (AI) to reach younger audiences, while leaning on more than a century of history and well-known brand ambassadors to connect with its mature consumers.

From an operating perspective, Coca-Cola is firing on all cylinders. Although it's not the growth story it once was, it has the right puzzle pieces in place to deliver consistent mid-single-digit sales and earnings growth. It has more than two dozen brands generating at least $1 billion in annual sales, and is operating in all but three countries (Cuba, North Korea, and Russia). This gives Coca-Cola a steady stream of predictable cash flow in developed countries, and needle-moving organic growth potential in emerging markets.

Coca-Cola is also known for its top-tier capital-return program. In February, the company increased its quarterly dividend by 5.4%, which marked the 62nd consecutive year it's lifted its payout. Berkshire Hathaway is generating a roughly 60% annual yield relative to its cost basis in Coca-Cola stock.

Lastly -- and to stay on theme -- the valuation makes sense. Coca-Cola's forward P/E ratio of 21 is roughly 10% below its average forward-year earnings multiple over the last five years.

Yahoo Finance,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/why-nextera-energy-partners-plunged-204818657.html,2024-07-01,20:48:18 UTC,Why NextEra Energy Partners Plunged Today,"Shares of NextEra Energy Partners (NYSE: NEP) fell on Monday, down 8.7% in today's trading.

The master limited partnership (MLP) focused on buying and holding renewable energy projects from parent utility NextEra Energy (NYSE: NEE) was down after a Wall Street analyst downgraded the stock and lowered his price target.

Why? A potential cut to the company's 13.8% dividend could be in the cards.

RBC forecasts a dividend cut for NextEra

In his note today, RBC Capital analyst Shelby Tucker lowered his rating on NextEra Partners from outperform to market perform, cutting his price target from $38 to $30.

Tucker now believes that there aren't enough lower-cost wind repowering opportunities to grow NextEra's earnings to its 5% to 8% target, and that the company may have trouble keeping the dividend this high while also paying off billions of looming convertible equity portfolio financing (CEPF) maturities. These types of project financings enabled NextEra to fund projects in a relatively low-cost and flexible manner, but NEP's CEPF notes were sold when interest rates were much lower. After 2026, there are $3.7 billion of looming maturities that will need to be paid off.

While NextEra has time and options to pay off these liabilities, the increased cost of capital since the CEPFs were sold means that it will be expensive for NextEra to refinance. Thus, while management had contemplated private financings, Tucker thinks the lingering higher interest rate environment will necessitate a cut to the company's distribution. Tucker suspects a 50% cut could be in the cards, and may even be prudent. That would take care of the CEPF financing while leaving the company free from having to take on expensive debt or issue equity. Issuing equity would be painful, with the stock down 68% from its all-time highs.

Be wary of MLPs that pay out high dividends

Investors may have been tempted to buy NextEra in the past due to its ample and growing dividend. But the problem with these MLP models is that when interest rate or economic worries pop up and the stock goes down, the company can no longer issue stock to grow. Thus, the model becomes ""stuck"" and can result in painful dilution or cuts to what once looked like a mouth-watering dividend yield. It looks like that is what's happening with NEP today.

Most Read from Bloomberg

In a proposed class action filed Friday in Brooklyn, New York, federal court, GameStop shareholder Martin Radev sued Gill for securities fraud, claiming he was seeking to manipulate the stock for his own gain. In a court filing late Monday afternoon, Radev said he was voluntarily dismissing the lawsuit.

It’s unclear why Radev dropped the suit, and his lawyers didn’t immediately respond to requests for comment. The dismissal was without prejudice, meaning he is free to file the suit again.

Gill also didn’t respond to an email seeking comment.

One of the public faces of the 2021 meme-stock craze, Gill amassed more than a million followers across his “Roaring Kitty” YouTube channel and “DeepF***ingValue” Reddit page. He reemerged in May and again began posting about Gamestop on X, the social media platform formerly known as Twitter.

The suit alleged that Gill acquired 120,000 call options in GameStop before he began posting about the company in May. The stock, which had been trading around $17 just before Gill began to post, soared to $48.75 on May 14.

On June 2, he revealed that he owned 5 million shares of GameStop and 120,000 call options that were set to expire on June 21. By June 13, Gill’s holdings had risen to more than 9 million shares of GameStop with no outstanding call options.

Gill “quietly sold and/or exercised (i.e., dumped) all 120,000 of his GameStop call options for a large profit, seemingly to increase his own stake in GameStop stock by over 4 million shares,” Radev said in the suit.

GameStop shares have since fallen, though they’re still higher than they were before Gill’s posts. They closed at around $23 on Monday afternoon.

GameStop’s recent rise was less pronounced than during the meme-stock frenzy. The company surged more than 1,700% during one stretch in January 2021, and the stock’s stratospheric rise appeared to pit scrappy individual investors against sophisticated hedge funds that were heavily shorting the troubled mall retailer.

On Monday, Chewy Inc. shares spiked as much as 10% after Gill disclosed a 6.6% passive stake in the online pet food and product retailer.

Story continues

The filing with the US Securities and Exchange Commission came days after the investor posted a photo with a puppy without any comment on X. The post briefly sent the pet food retailer to a one-year high on Thursday.

The case is Radev v. Gill, 24-cv-04608, US District Court, Eastern District of New York.

Photo by Marco Bello/Getty Images

Cathie Wood's Ark Invest has destroyed $14 billion in wealth over the past decade.

A Morningstar analysis found that Ark Invest topped the list of wealth destroyers among other investment companies.

""These funds managed to lose value for shareholders even during a generally bullish market,"" Morningstar said.

Cathie Wood's Ark Invest has destroyed an estimated $14.3 billion in wealth over the past decade, according to a recent Morningstar analysis.

Ark Invest was all the rage in 2020 and 2021, when its concentrated bets on highly speculative technology companies paid off in a big way thanks to low interest rates and a boom in risk appetite among retail investors.

Ark's flagship innovation ETF, ARKK, soared nearly 150% in 2020, and that massive outperformance helped drive a surge of inflows into its funds right near its peak.

The firm attracted nearly $30 billion in assets in 2020 and 2021, which were then decimated during the 2022 bear market when its flagship fund plunged 67%.

The ARKK ETF destroyed $7.1 billion in wealth, while its healthcare-focused ARK Genomic ETF destroyed $4.2 billion in wealth, according to Morningstar.

Across all fund families that have destroyed wealth over the past decade, Ark Invest topped the list — and its losses were more than double the next firm on the list.

What's striking is that Ark's massive wealth destruction occurred during a favorable time for the stock market.

""These funds managed to lose value for shareholders even during a generally bullish market,"" Morningstar analyst Amy Arnott said.

The ARKK ETF has generated a total positive return of 121.8% since its inception in 2014, which is less than half the Nasdaq 100's gain of 329.5% over the same time period. Meanwhile, the ARKK ETF is still down 71% from its record high.

Despite the massive wealth destruction, ARK Invest as a business is doing just fine. The investment company still has more than $13 billion in assets across its suite of ETFs, signaling that not all investors have abandoned Wood's investment strategy.

But in an investment world that is shifting to valuing profits over growth, it is unclear when Ark Invest's investment strategy might pay off again for investors.

The firm's top holdings currently include Coinbase, Tesla, Roku, and Zoom Video, all of which have had a rough start to 2024.

""The biggest value destroyers in the fund industry illustrate that there's no guarantee of success, even during a generally favorable market environment. They also provide a valuable case study in how not to invest,"" Arnott said.

The stock has soared more than 750% as of this writing, driven higher by the potential implications of generative artificial intelligence (AI). The ability to streamline time-consuming tasks and automate routine processes promises to increase productivity and could unleash a wave of greater profits for businesses that adopt this cutting-edge technology.

Nvidia's graphics processing units (GPUs) are the gold standard and provide the computational horsepower necessary for AI processing. This has let loose a tidal wave of demand for the company's high-end processors, sending its business and financial results surging, resulting in its recent 10-for-1 stock split.

While some investors fear the easy money has been made, others believe the best is yet to come. One analyst suggests Nvidia has a killer advantage that will help it stay ahead of the competition and unleash a ""cash gusher"" that will profit shareholders.

Let's see if the analyst's argument holds water and what it means for investors.

Nvidia's GB200 Grace Blackwell Superchip. Image source: Nvidia.

A long track record of success

To understand the source of this ""cash gusher,"" it helps to take a step back to see how Nvidia got to where it is today.

Nvidia's state-of-the-art processors have long been the industry standard for serious gamers. The company controlled 88% of the discrete desktop GPU market in the first quarter, according to data compiled by Jon Peddie Research.

However, Nvidia adapted that same technology to zip data through the ether, becoming the go-to processor for data centers. Estimates suggest the company controls as much as 92% of the data center GPU market, according to IoT Analytics. Nvidia is also the undisputed leader in processing machine learning -- an established branch of AI -- with an estimated 95% of that market, according to data supplied by New Street Research.

Since much of generative AI processing occurs in the cloud and data centers, Nvidia has cemented its position as the leader. The company is set to release its Blackwell family of processors later this year, and CEO Jensen Huang has said, ""The Blackwell Architecture platform will likely be the most successful product in our history."" If that's the case, and I believe that it is, the best could be yet to come.

Furthermore, while the popular narrative says the competition is coming for Nvidia, thus far -- despite years of opportunity -- no serious competitor has emerged.

A ""cash gusher""

Melius Research analyst Ben Reitzes believes Nvidia has one killer advantage that some investors may be overlooking, one that will keep the company on the leading edge of technology. Nvidia provides not only the chips that are tailor-made for AI but also the integrated software that eeks every last ounce of performance from these AI-centric processors. This ""full stack"" approach, or the marrying of hardware and software, provides Nvidia with a key advantage that will be hard for rivals to match, particularly given the company's long track record of leadership in the field.

Story continues

""What they did is they built a computing language and an ecosystem that allows you to monetize AI, and obviously, they're killing it,"" Reitzes said.

The analyst goes on to note that the cadence of Nvidia's research and development (R&D) makes it hard for competitors to keep up. The company recently increased its already relentless pace of innovation, as CEO Jensen Huang said the company is now ""on a one-year rhythm,"" releasing new processors every year instead of every two years. ""They're running 150 miles an hour while everyone else is running 100. It's going to be hard to catch these guys,"" Reitzes said.

As a result of the accelerating adoption of AI and Nvidia's dominant position, it's estimated the company will generate $270 billion in cash in the coming three years, which could unleash a wave of returns to shareholders in the form of stock buybacks and higher dividend payments.

The analyst notes that even with higher R&D spending, the influx of cash will far outweigh any potential uses, suggesting the majority will be returned to shareholders.

Investors are already seeing evidence of that shift. Late last year, Nvidia announced a new $25 billion share repurchase plan. Furthermore, in conjunction with its stock split announcement in May, the company increased its dividend payment by 150%. That said, Nvidia is currently using less than 1% of profits to fund the dividend, and even at its higher rate, the yield is a paltry 0.03%.

This illustrates that there's still ample opportunity for Nvidia to return cash to shareholders, and with the ongoing tsunami of AI adoption, the company will have an increasing amount of resources to do just that. Furthermore, given its killer advantage, its unlikely a rival will take Nvidia's crown, at least not anytime soon.

BYD sold 426,039 EVs in the April-June quarter, according to Reuters' calculations based on its monthly sales reports. That's around 12,000 vehicles fewer than Tesla's vehicle deliveries estimated for the second quarter.

BYD and Autotorino store in Milan. (Reuters)

Tesla is expected to report a 6% drop in April-June quarter vehicle deliveries on Tuesday, the first time the U.S. firm is set to post two straight quarters of decline, as it deals with stiff competition in China and slow demand due to a lack of affordable new models.

The company may again cede its EV championship to BYD if the actual results turn out to be softer than estimated, with Barclays predicting an 11% drop in second-quarter deliveries, Tesla's biggest ever.

Tesla has hit a speed bump after years of rapid growth that helped make it the world's most valuable automaker. It warned in January that deliveries growth in 2024 would be ""notably lower"" as a boost from months-long price cuts wanes.

The EV maker has cut output of its best-selling Model Y electric car by a double-digit percentage number at its Shanghai plant since March to address weakening demand for its aged models in China, its second-largest market after the United States, Reuters reported in May.

By comparison, its top Chinese competitor BYD maintained steady growth in EV sales, while EV upstarts such as Nio reported stellar growth last quarter. NIO's vehicle deliveries in the second quarter more than doubled to 57,300 units.

Price cuts and a growing shift in consumer demand to EVs and hybrids from gasoline-powered vehicles are the main reasons behind Chinese EV makers' strong sales in recent months, said Cui Dongshu, secretary general, China Passenger Car Association (CPCA).

Sales of new energy vehicles including EVs and plug-in hybrids in China made up 46.7% of total car sales in May, a fresh monthly high, as per CPCA data.

Yahoo Finance,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/why-snowflake-rallied-today-start-192200246.html,2024-07-01,19:22:00 UTC,Why Snowflake Rallied Today to Start July,"Shares of cloud-based data lake provider Snowflake (NYSE: SNOW) were in rally mode Monday even on a rather muted day for many tech stocks. Shares were up 4.8% as of 1:30 p.m. EDT.

Snowflake's outperformance is likely due to a positive note issued by analysts at Goldman Sachs, who added the stock to the firm's ""Conviction List"" today.

Goldman likes Snowflake's entry point and innovation pipeline

Goldman analyst Kash Rangan added Snowflake's stock to the firm's ""Conviction List"" today. Rangan's case is that he believes the recent weakness in the stock makes for an ""attractive entry point,"" given that the stock is down for the year, even while Rangan is optimistic about the company's new CEO Sridhar Ramaswamy. Rangan believes Ramaswamy, who is a more product-oriented manager than the company's previous head, can accelerate Snowflake's innovation engine to thrive in the AI era.

Of note, Ramaswamy co-founded AI search start-up Neeva in 2019, which Snowflake acquired last year, bringing Ramaswamy into Snowflake. Since then, he's been heading Snowflake's artificial intelligence (AI) strategy, including the development of Snowflake Cortex, a fully managed service that simplifies using Snowflake for AI applications. At the end of February, he was appointed CEO as former CEO Frank Slootman stepped back into the chairman of the board role.

Can Snowflake grow into its valuation?

Prior to the Goldman note today, Snowflake was about $135 per share -- not too far off from its $120 initial public offering (IPO) price back in September of 2020, nearly four years ago.

It's not that Snowflake the business hasn't performed well. Last quarter, core-product revenue surged 34%, and remaining performance obligations, which take into account new capacity to be consumed and recognized by Snowflake in future periods, accelerated 46%. Net retention, meaning how much existing customers used last quarter compared to the prior-year quarter, came in at a healthy 128%.

Still, there are worries. Management has guided to just 24% product-revenue growth for the full fiscal year, implying a deceleration. RPO was a bright spot relative to a year ago but actually slightly down from the prior quarter. And a net-retention rate of 128% actually marks a continued deceleration and the lowest figure in Snowflake's history as a public company.

With Snowflake having traded extremely expensively its entire life as a public corporation, it's still not particularly cheap at 15 times sales. So while Rangan may be looking at Snowflake's stock being down near its IPO price as a good entry point, keep in mind the stock is not particularly cheap overall. The new CEO will have to be able to reaccelerate growth through AI innovation in order for the stock to have material upside.

Savvy investors have gravitated toward both stocks. A company's share price tends to increase about twice as fast as the S&P 500 (SNPINDEX: ^GSPC) during the year following a stock split announcement.

Indeed, certain Wall Street analysts see substantial upside in Nvidia and Broadcom.

Beth Kendig at the I/O Fund expects Nvidia to achieve a $10 trillion market capitalization by 2030. That forecast implies about 230% upside from its current market capitalization of $3 trillion.

Joseph Moore at Morgan Stanley has outlined a bull-case price target that values Broadcom at $2,292 per share by June 2025. That will change to $229.20 per share after the stock split. Either way, that forecast implies 70% upside from its current price of $1,605 per share.

Here's what investors should know about Nvidia and Broadcom.

Nvidia: The market leading in data center GPUs and AI chips

Nvidia graphics processing units (GPUs) are the gold standard in rendering realistic computer graphics and accelerating complex data center workloads like artificial intelligence (AI) applications. Nvidia also provides adjacent data center hardware, such as central processing units (CPUs) and networking equipment, as well as subscription software and services that support graphics and AI workflows.

Nvidia holds more than 95% market share in workstation graphics processors and more than 90% market share in data center GPUs. Additionally, regarding AI specifically, The Wall Street Journal recently reported that ""Nvidia's chips underpin all of the most advanced AI systems, giving the company a market share estimated at more than 80%."" Looking ahead, Nvidia is unlikely to lose its leadership position anytime soon because it has a durable competitive advantage in CUDA.

Nvidia CUDA is a programming model lets GPUs (originally designed for graphics applications) accelerate all sorts of data center computing tasks. The CUDA ecosystem comprises hundreds of software libraries (building blocks) that streamline model training and application development. No other chipmaker has a comparable ecosystem of supporting software. In other words, competitors not only need to overcome the superior performance of Nvidia hardware, but also the immense convenience afforded to developers by Nvidia software.

Nvidia reported blockbuster financial results in the first quarter. Revenue increased 262% to $26 billion and non-GAAP net income soared 461% to $6.12 per diluted share. Nvidia is set to maintain that momentum as the AI market grows. In fact, CFRA analyst Angelo Zino recently said Nvidia ""will be the most important company to our civilization over the next decade.""

Story continues

Additionally, rapid innovation should keep the company ahead of its peers. Nvidia Blackwell GPUs offer four times faster AI training and 30 times faster AI inferencing as compared to the previous Hopper generation. Rosenblatt analyst Han Mosesmann recently said, ""The new Blackwell GPU platform, which ramps up later in 2024, is likely the most ambitious project Silicon Valley has ever witnessed.""

Wall Street expects Nvidia to grow earnings per share at 33% annually over the next three to five years. That makes its current valuation of 68 times adjusted earnings look a little expensive, but not unreasonably so. Investors should be prepared to pay a premium if they want to own this stock.

Personally, I am skeptical about Nvidia achieving a $10 trillion market capitalization by 2030. I certainly believe it's possible, but many things would have to go right for the company. That said, I do believe Nvidia will beat the S&P 500 over the next three to five years, so patient investors should consider buying a small position today.

Broadcom: The market leader in ASICs and networking chips

Broadcom breaks its business into semiconductor solutions and infrastructure software. The company earns semiconductor solutions revenue by developing chips for wired and wireless networking, data center storage, and other end markets. Broadcom also develops application specific integrated circuits (ASICs), chips purpose-built for specialized use cases like artificial intelligence. Additionally, Broadcom earns infrastructure software revenue from cybersecurity, monitoring, and virtualization products.

Broadcom is the leading provider of ASICs with 35% market share, while its closest competitor Marvell Technology holds 12% market share. It is also the leader in networking and wireless chips. That puts Broadcom in a good position because AI adoption is driving demand for ASICs and networking chips. Analysts at Goldman Sachs recently wrote, ""Alongside Nvidia, we view Broadcom as a critical piece to the ongoing AI infrastructure build-out.""

Broadcom reported solid financial results in the second quarter, beating estimates on the top and bottom lines. Revenue surged 43% to $12.5 billion on particularly strong demand for AI chips and virtualization software. Meanwhile, GAAP net income declined 46% to $4.42 per diluted share, but that was due to costs associated with its 2023 acquisition of VMware. Non-GAAP operating income increased 32% during the second quarter.

Broadcom is a hidden gem among AI stocks because Nvidia casts a long shadow. But its strong position in ASICs and networking chips should be a source of momentous revenue growth in the coming years. Indeed, management expects AI chips to account for 25% of its semiconductor solutions revenue in 2025, up from 15% in 2023.

However, Wall Street expects the company to grow earnings per share at 17% annually over the next three to five years. That makes its current valuation of 69 times earnings look expensive, especially when the three-year average is 32 times earnings. To be fair, earnings may grow more quickly than anticipated depending on how the VMware integration progresses. But I plan to avoid the stock until the valuation appears more reasonable. To that end, I see little chance of an 70% return over the next 12 months.

That comes out to a cumulative return of 2,440%. That's an enviable return on investment over the long term. If you want to beat that return, you need to invest in stocks with above-average growth prospects.

Stock prices can fluctuate for all kinds of reasons in the near term, so trying to beat the market day to day is a fool's errand. However, over many years, there is a high correlation between a company's earnings performance and the stock's return. If you focus on companies that can at least double their earnings in five years, which comes to an annualized earnings increase of 15%, you significantly stack the odds in your favor of beating the market.

To give you some ideas, here are two top stocks that have the potential to double in value in five years and outperform the Nasdaq.

1. Carnival

Carnival (NYSE: CCL) is the largest cruise line in the world and continues to benefit from strong demand. The stock is up 18% over the past year, and while that is less than the Nasdaq's return of 33%, Carnival's prospects for improving earnings growth in the coming years could potentially double the share price over the next five years.

With revenue growing at a healthy rate due to strong demand for cruise vacations, management is focusing more on managing costs to deliver profitable growth. In the May-ended quarter, Carnival posted a 17% year-over-year increase in revenue and turned a year-ago loss into a net profit of $92 million.

Looking ahead, Carnival should drive higher margins and profits from two opportunities. The first is next year's planned opening of Celebration Key, an exclusive destination that is close to Carnival's ports and should lower fuel costs to boost profits. Strong demand for travel to this new destination will allow the company to gradually raise ticket prices over time and realize high returns on the company's investment.

Another opportunity for profitable growth is the transfer of Carnival's vessels from its P&O Cruises Australia brand into Carnival Cruise Line, which will expand capacity for the better-performing Carnival brand.

Wall Street analysts expect Carnival to grow earnings at an annualized rate of 12% over the long term. If the stock's forward price-to-earnings ratio moves up from its current 16.3 multiple to 20, which is more in line with its pre-pandemic valuation range, Carnival stock could double in value in the next five years.

2. Uber Technologies

Uber Technologies (NYSE: UBER) continues to grow revenue thanks to a large base of 7 million people earning money with its service every month. The stock has climbed 66% over the past year, effectively doubling the Nasdaq's return of 33%, but the stock has plenty of room to run in the coming years.

Story continues

Uber's first-quarter results show the business growing at the rates investors need to double their money. In the first quarter, gross bookings, revenue, and the number of trips each grew 15% or higher year over year.

One important catalyst could drive strong earnings growth over the next five years. Uber is using its valuable data to offer advertising to connect merchants with consumers. The company launched Uber Journey Ads in 2022, which helps brands gain exposure to consumers using Uber, and it's growing into a multibillion-dollar opportunity.

Uber achieved $900 million of annualized advertising revenue in the fourth quarter of 2023. It's a small piece of a business generating over $10 billion of quarterly revenue, but advertising generates high margins that can benefit its low-margin delivery business.

Piper Sandler analysts called Uber a ""sleeping giant"" in advertising recently due to its large customer base. The consensus estimate has Uber's earnings reaching $4.31 by 2026 and growing 45% on an annualized basis over the next several years. This puts Uber stock on track to double in value within the next five years.

A stock split is an event where a publicly traded company cosmetically alters its share price and outstanding share count by the same magnitude. It's ""cosmetic"" in the sense that changing a company's share price and share count by the same factor has no effect on its market cap or operating performance.

There are two types of stock splits: forward and reverse. With a forward-stock split, companies are angling to make their shares more nominally affordable for retail investors who might not have access to fractional-share purchases with their broker. Meanwhile, a reverse-stock split aims to increase a company's share price, often with the goal of ensuring it meets the minimum continued listing standards on a major stock exchange.

Most investors tend to favor forward-stock splits, because the companies enacting forward splits are typically out-innovating and out-executing their peers.

Since 2024 began, nine high-profile stocks have announced or completed a stock split. However, not all of these stock-split stocks share the same outlook. As we motor into the second half of 2024, one of these stock-split stocks stands out as a phenomenal deal for patient investors, while two others are worth avoiding.

Stock-split stock No. 1 that's worth avoiding in the second half of 2024: Nvidia

In spite of its undeniable popularity, AI juggernaut Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA) is the first stock-split I'd suggest investors purposefully avoid for the final six months of 2024. Nvidia announced a 10-for-1 forward split on May 22, which was completed on June 7.

Although I'm no fan of Nvidia from an investment perspective, I'm happy to give the company credit where it's due. Nvidia's AI-graphics processing units (GPUs) have set the standard in high-compute data centers. According to semiconductor analysis firm TechInsights, it was responsible for 98% of the 3.85 million AI-GPUs that were shipped last year. Having first-mover and compute advantages over its peers has given the company substantial pricing power.

But this is where the praise ends and history works its way back into the discussion.

Since the advent of the internet in the mid-1990s, there hasn't been a buzzy innovation, technology, or trend that avoided an early stage euphoria-bursting event. This is to say that investors have overestimated the adoption and/or utility of every next-big-thing innovation or technology for 30 years (including the internet itself). While this doesn't mean artificial intelligence and Nvidia can't be wildly successful over the long run, the simple fact that most businesses lack a concrete plan for AI suggests a bubble is brewing.

Story continues

To add to this point, Nvidia's trailing-12-month price-to-sales (P/S) ratio is strikingly similar to the P/S ratio peaks we witnessed from Cisco Systems and Amazon prior to the dot-com bubble bursting. History may not precisely repeat on Wall Street, but it does have a tendency to rhyme.

We're also starting to see evidence that competition will weigh on Nvidia's monopoly like market share in AI-accelerated data centers. Even if the company's GPUs were to maintain their compute advantages, new competitors can benefit from demand overwhelming supply — and Nvidia can't meet all of its enterprise demand.

Furthermore, Nvidia's four-largest customers by net sales are internally developing their own AI-GPUs. Even if these chips are used as a complement to Nvidia's H100 GPU, it signals the intent by America's most-influential businesses to reduce their reliance on Nvidia's hardware.

Stock-split stock No. 2 to keep your distance from in the latter half of 2024: Chipotle Mexican Grill

The second stock-split stock that investors would be wise to avoid in the second half of 2024 is none other than the hottest fast-casual restaurant chain on Wall Street, Chipotle Mexican Grill (NYSE: CMG). Chipotle's board announced the company's first-ever stock split (a 50-for-1 forward split) on March 19, with its share adjustment occurring after the closing bell on June 25.

Similar to Nvidia, I can recognize that Chipotle and its management team have done a lot right, even if I'm not currently a fan from an investment standpoint. Chipotle shares have rallied more than 14,800% since its initial public offering price of $22 in January 2006 due to a combination of simplicity and innovation.

Chipotle has kept things simple by sourcing its vegetables locally (when possible), using responsibly raised meats, prepping its food daily, and avoiding a bulky menu. The result is a well-oiled machine that quickly prepares meals and keeps lines in its stores moving.

But there's only so much innovation that can be squeezed out of a fast-casual restaurant chain. While the introduction of mobile order-dedicated drive-thru lanes (""Chipotlanes"") has helped the company immensely, Chipotle's same-store sales grew by only 7% during the first quarter. Though 7% same-store sales growth would be phenomenal for most businesses, it's a genuine eyesore for a company valued at roughly 50 times forward-year earnings.

I'll also add that 1.6% of the 7% organic growth rate in existing stores came from an ""increase in average check."" While it's always good news when a company enjoys strong pricing power, nearly a quarter of Chipotle's organic sales growth is simply due to inflation.

Considering that there are still predictive indicators that suggest a U.S. economic downturn is on the horizon — e.g., the historic decline in U.S. M2 money supply — companies with premium valuations in traditionally slower-growing industries, like Chipotle, are the likeliest to get thumped if a recession does materialize.

The stock-split stock you can confidently buy for the second half of 2024: Sirius XM Holdings

Out of the nine high-profile companies to have announced a stock split in 2024, eight are conducting forward splits. However, the best value of the group is the only top-tier company slated to complete a reverse-stock split: satellite-radio provider Sirius XM Holdings (NASDAQ: SIRI).

In a June 17 filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission, Sirius XM announced its intent to conduct a 1-for-10 reverse split upon completing its merger with Liberty Media's Sirius XM tracking stock, Liberty Sirius XM Group. This combination and share consolidation, which'll create a single outstanding share base, is expected to close during the third quarter.

Although reverse-stock splits are usually undertaken by companies on the decline, Sirius XM's operating performance has pointed to steady growth over the long haul.

One of the keys to Sirius XM's success is its revenue diversity. Terrestrial and online radio providers generate most of their sales from advertising. The thing about advertising is that it's highly cyclical and prone to fluctuations. Sirius XM brought in less than 19% of its first-quarter sales from ads (via Pandora).

By comparison, Sirius XM generated close to 78% of its sales in the March-ended quarter from subscriptions. Subscribers to its satellite-radio services are far less likely to cancel than businesses are to reduce their ad spending during periods of economic turbulence. Couple this with the fact that Sirius XM is the only licensed satellite-radio operator — ergo, it has exceptionally strong pricing power — and you have a recipe for steady operating cash flow in virtually any economic climate.

Additionally, Sirius XM enjoys better cost transparency than most radio operators. Whereas content and royalty costs are going to ebb-and-flow from quarter to quarter, transmission and equipment expenses aren't going to change much, if at all, regardless of how many subscribers the company adds.

At no point in Sirius XM's 30 years as a publicly traded company has it been cheaper than it is now. Shares can be scooped up by opportunistic investors for just 8 times forward-year earnings, which represents a 55% discount to its average forward-year earnings multiple over the last five years.

Yahoo Finance,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/nvidia-top-ai-stock-dont-000000523.html,2024-07-02,00:00:00 UTC,"Nvidia Is a Top AI Stock, but Don't Ignore These 4 Red Flags","Nvidia's (NASDAQ: NVDA) stock has rallied more than 600% over the past two years. Most of that rally was driven by the growth of the artificial intelligence (AI) market, which boosted its sales of data center GPUs for processing complex AI tasks.

The market's insatiable demand for its data center chips continues to outstrip its available supply, and analysts expect Nvidia's revenue to increase at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 45% from fiscal 2024 to fiscal 2027 (which ends in January 2027). They expect its earnings per share (EPS) to rise at a CAGR of 51%.

Image source: Nvidia.

So even though Nvidia is already worth more than $3 trillion, it could still have plenty of room to run. But before investors buy this high-flying stock, they should pay attention to these four red flags that could unexpectedly end its historic rally.

1. It's become an all-in play on AI chips

Back in fiscal 2022 (which ended in January 2022), Nvidia generated 46% of its revenue from its gaming GPUs, 39% from its data center GPUs, and the rest from its professional visualization, auto, and OEM chips. However, that product mix completely changed over the following two years as its sales of data center chips eclipsed its gaming chips.

In the first quarter of fiscal 2025, Nvidia generated 87% of its revenue from data center chips, 10% from gaming chips, and the remaining 3% from its other categories. It generated $22.6 billion in data center revenue in that single quarter compared to its total revenue of nearly $27 billion for all of fiscal 2023. That breakneck expansion transformed Nvidia from a more diversified GPU maker to an all-in play on AI chips.

That's fine if you believe Nvidia will continue dominating the AI market as it expands. But if the AI market abruptly cools off, Nvidia's chip shortage could quickly become a supply glut. If its data center business sputters out, it can't fall back on the growth of its gaming segment and other smaller divisions to soften those year-over-year comparisons.

2. It faces unpredictable regulatory challenges

Nvidia's overwhelming dependence on the AI market exposes it to a lot of unpredictable regulatory challenges. U.S. regulators have repeatedly tightened their export curbs on its AI chip shipments to China, and that pressure could drive Chinese chipmakers to accelerate the development of their own AI chips.

Tighter regulations for generative AI technologies, which have already taken effect in Europe, could throttle the growth of the red-hot industry and drive companies to rein in their purchases of new AI chips. Complaints about mass plagiarism and other ethical issues could also force AI companies to expand at a slower and more measured pace.

Story continues

3. It faces clear competitive threats

Nvidia controls 88% of the discrete GPU market, according to JPR, but its top rival AMD has been rolling out cheaper AI accelerators. AMD's MI300 Instinct GPUs have already beat Nvidia's H100 GPUs -- which cost about four times more -- in terms of raw processing power and memory usage across several industry benchmarks. Intel also recently claimed its new Gaudi 3 AI accelerators are faster and more power efficient than Nvidia's H100 GPUs.

Super Micro Computer, which grew rapidly over the past few years by producing dedicated AI servers powered by Nvidia's chips, has also been developing new servers optimized for AMD's and Intel's cheaper AI accelerators. These cheaper servers could attract cost-conscious data center operators and erode Nvidia's market share.

Meanwhile, Nvidia's tight supply and high prices are driving its top customers -- including OpenAI, Microsoft, Alphabet's Google, and Amazon -- to develop their own first-party AI accelerators. These chips won't threaten Nvidia's near-term growth, but they could gradually loosen its iron grip on the hyperscale data center market.

4. Its insiders are net sellers

Nvidia's stock isn't cheap at 49 times forward earnings and 26 times this year's sales. But if it had the potential to double or triple again in near term, its valuations would seem reasonable and its insiders should be scooping up more shares.

Yet over the past 12 months, Nvidia's insiders sold more than 4 times as many shares as they bought. Over the past three months, they sold more than 52 times as many shares as they bought. Those insider sales don't necessarily mean it stock is headed off a cliff, but it's a worrisome trend that suggests its near-term upside is limited.

Is it still safe to buy Nvidia's stock?

I believe Nvidia is still worth buying, but investors shouldn't assume it's a perfect growth stock. Its transformation from a gaming company into an AI one was abrupt, and it could experience significant growing pains over the next few years. But assuming it overcomes all those competitive, regulatory, and macro challenges, it should remain one of the easiest ways to profit from the secular expansion of the AI market.

The stock is up over 45% so far in 2024. That's great news for shareholders. However, for some investors, this tremendous success pushed Broadcom's share price so high (over $1,600) that they were reluctant to buy.

That won't be a problem for too much longer. In its first-quarter update a few weeks ago, Broadcom announced plans for a 10-for-1 stock split after the market close on July 12, 2024. The semiconductor and software maker's shares will trade on a split-adjusted basis beginning July 15, 2024.

Broadcom CFO Kirsten Spears said the purpose of this stock split for ""to make ownership of Broadcom stock more accessible to investors and employees."" Some believe this greater accessibility could provide a nice catalyst for the already high-flying stock. Should you buy Broadcom stock hand over fist before its 10-for-1 stock split?

The case for Broadcom

Historically, stocks have jumped 25% during the 12 months following a stock split announcement, according to the Bank of America Research Investment Committee. Broadcom's shares have risen only around 8% since the announcement of its stock split, so it could still have plenty of room to run if history is a guide.

Are there reasons to buy Broadcom stock other than a potential stock split surge? Absolutely. I'd put the company's acquisition of VMware near the top of the list. This deal contributed significantly to Broadcom's revenue soaring 43% year over year in the second quarter of 2024. Earlier this year, Broadcom CEO Hock Tan said that the company expects VMWare's revenue growth will accelerate through the remainder of fiscal 2024.

However, the biggest reason to buy Broadcom stock is its artificial intelligence (AI) opportunity. Seven of the eight largest AI clusters in the world use Broadcom's Ethernet technology. Broadcom expects its networking revenue to jump 40% this year primarily due to AI-related demand.

The company's AI accelerator business is highly profitable. Creating networks to connect AI accelerators is complicated. But Broadcom is arguably the best at doing it. As Tan said in the Q2 earnings call, the company has ""the deepest and broadest understanding of what it takes for complex large workloads to be scaled out in an AI fabric.""

Broadcom is also a free cash flow (FCF) machine. In Q2, the company generated FCF of $4.4 billion -- 36% of total revenue. If we exclude the cash Broadcom used for restructuring and integration, its FCF rose 18% year over year to $5.3 billion and made up 42% of revenue.

The case against Broadcom

Despite the excitement about Broadcom's stock split, it won't change anything about the company's underlying business. Also, investors who wanted to buy the stock but were leery of its high share price could have done so with fractional shares.

Broadcom's growth story wouldn't be nearly as impressive without the VMWare deal. Excluding VMWare, Q2 revenue increased by only 12% year over year. The company won't be able to rely on the acquisition to boost its year-over-year numbers after Q4, since the transaction closed on Nov. 22, 2023.

Some parts of Broadcom's business remain weak. Wireless revenue in Q2 rose only 2% year over year. Server storage connectivity revenue fell 27%. Broadband revenue plunged 39%.

Just five customers generate roughly 40% of total sales. Apple alone makes up 17% of Broadcom's total revenue. This reliance on a small number of customers presents a key risk for Broadcom.

The company's AI opportunity is big. However, Nvidia could emerge as a strong competitor to Broadcom in Ethernet switching and custom AI accelerators.

There's also a potential valuation concern. Broadcom stock trades at nearly 34 times forward earnings and 16.7 times trailing 12-month sales.

Buy before the split?

I don't think investors should be in a rush to buy Broadcom stock before its stock split. My hunch is that the split will be largely a non-event rather than a major catalyst.

That said, Broadcom could remain a winner over the long term. Patient investors could buy now, wait until the stock split, or hold off for a pullback to buy on the dip. If you plan on owning Broadcom for 10 years or more, the exact timing of when you buy probably won't matter all that much.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - A U.S. stock rally supercharged by excitement over artificial intelligence is drawing comparisons with the dotcom bubble two decades ago, raising the question of whether prices have again been inflated by optimism over a revolutionary technology.

AI fever, coupled with a resilient economy and stronger earnings, has lifted the S&P 500 index to fresh records this year following a run of more than 50% from its October 2022 low. The tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite index has gained over 70% since the end of 2022.

While various metrics show stock valuations and investor exuberance have yet to hit peaks reached at the turn of the century, the similarities are easy to spot. A small group of massive tech stocks including AI chipmaker Nvidia symbolize today's market, recalling the ""Four Horsemen"" of the late 1990s: Cisco, Dell, Microsoft and Intel.

The dizzying run in shares of Nvidia, which gained nearly 4,300% in a recent five-year period, stirred memories of how network equipment maker Cisco surged about 4,500% over five years leading up to its peak in 2000, according to a BTIG comparison of the two stocks.

Valuations have grown as well, though many tech champions appear to be in far better financial shape than their dot-com counterparts of the late 1990s and early 2000s. Other measures, such as investor bullishness, have yet to reach the frothy heights of the turn of the century.

The concern is that the AI-driven surge will end the same way as the dot-com boom - with an epic crash. After nearly quadrupling in just over three years, the Nasdaq Composite plunged almost 80% from its March 2000 peak to October 2002. The S&P 500, which doubled in a similar timeframe, collapsed nearly 50% in that period.

While several internet stocks such as Amazon survived and eventually thrived, others never recovered.

""No one exactly knows what will happen with artificial intelligence,"" said Sameer Samana, senior global market strategist at the Wells Fargo Investment Institute, noting the same uncertainty about the eventual long-term winners.

Echoing the dot-com boom, the information technology sector has swelled to 32% of the S&P 500's total market value, the largest percentage since 2000 when it rose to nearly 35%, according to LSEG Datastream. Just three companies, Microsoft, Apple and Nvidia, represent over 20% of the index.

However, tech stocks are more modestly valued now than at the peak of the dot-com bubble, trading at 31 times forward earnings, compared to as high as 48 times in 2000, according to Datastream.

Story continues

The difference is clear in the valuations of Nvidia and Cisco, a key provider of products supporting internet infrastructure, whose stock has yet to rescale its peaks of the dotcom boom.

While both stocks have soared, Nvidia trades at 40 times forward earnings estimates, compared to Cisco's 131 level reached in March 2000, according to Datastream.

Capital Economics analysts also note that the current rally is being fueled more by solid earnings outlooks rather than growing valuations, a sign that fundamentals are more of a driver this time.

Forward earnings per share in sectors containing today's market leaders - tech, communication services and consumer discretionary - have been growing faster since early 2023 than the rest of the market, a Capital Economics analysis showed. By contrast, expected earnings in the sectors grew at a similar pace to the rest of the market in the late 1990s and early 2000s, while their valuations soared faster than for other stocks.

More broadly, the S&P 500's price-to-earnings ratio of 21 is well above its historical average but below the roughly 25 level reached in 1999 and 2000, according to Datastream.

""Our base case is that this tech bubble won't burst until the valuation of the overall market has reached the sort of level that it did in 2000,"" Capital Economics analysts said in a note.

Dotcom investors were much more euphoric by some measures. Bullish sentiment in the widely followed American Association of Individual Investors survey, often seen as a worrisome indicator at high levels, reached 75% in January 2000, just months before the market peaked. It recently stood at 44.5%, compared to its historical average of 37.5%.

While an AI bubble is not a foregone conclusion, many investors are wary that metrics could become even more stretched in coming months if U.S. growth remains robust and tech stocks continue charging higher.

""There are a lot of similarities,"" said Mike O'Rourke, chief market strategist at JonesTrading. ""When you have a bubble, usually it's rooted in ... some true, positive, fundamental development that is behind it and that creates that enthusiasm for people to pay any price for things.""

Cash routinely flows into my brokerage accounts from passive income sources and recurring transfers. I like to immediately put most of the money to work to generate more passive income.

High-quality, high-yielding dividend stocks are my go-to investment. I routinely add to my favorite positions. This month, I plan to continue buying shares of Realty Income (NYSE: O), Brookfield Infrastructure (NYSE: BIPC)(NYSE: BIP), and Enbridge (NYSE: ENB). Here's why I can't seem to get enough of these top-notch income stocks.

The name says it all

Realty Income has a phenomenal record of paying dividends. The diversified REIT has declared 647 consecutive monthly dividends. It has increased its payout 126 times since going public in 1994, including for the past 107 straight quarters, growing its payout at a 4.3% compound annual rate.

I fully expect that steady upward trend in the payout, which at a 6% yield is well above the S&P 500's 1.3% average, to continue. Realty Income's internal growth drivers -- rising rents and using retained cash flow after paying dividends to fund new investments -- should increase its adjusted funds from operations (FFO) by about 2% per share each year. That provides a solid foundation for a steadily rising dividend.

Meanwhile, the company estimates it can add about 0.5% to its FFO per share growth rate for every $1 billion of externally funded acquisitions it makes. Those acquisitions are financed by selling stock and issuing new debt. Realty Income conservatively estimates it can externally fund $4 billion to $6 billion of acquisitions each year. When added to its internal growth drivers, this should push its FFO per share growth rate to about 4% to 5% annually, in line with its historical growth rate. With trillions of dollars in commercial real estate across the U.S. and Europe, Realty Income should have plenty of new investment opportunities.

The high-powered growth should continue

Brookfield Infrastructure has done an excellent job of increasing its dividend. The global infrastructure operator has grown its payout at a 9% compound annual rate since 2009.

It should have plenty of fuel to grow its payout in the future. Brookfield expects a trio of organic drivers -- inflation-indexed rate increases, volume growth as the global economy expands, and expansion projects funded with retained cash flow after paying dividends -- to boost its FFO per share by 6% to 9% annually. The company has a large backlog of expansion projects underway, including several data center developments and two new semiconductor fabrication facilities it's helping finance.

Story continues

On top of organic growth, Brookfield has an excellent record of making accretive acquisitions. It recently agreed to buy an additional 10% interest in its Brazilian integrated rail and logistics provider, and it's working to purchase a portfolio of telecom towers in India. It's funding these deals by recycling capital. Brookfield believes that acquisitions will help drive its FFO growth rate into the double digits. That easily supports its plan to increase its dividend, which yields around 5%, by 5% to 9% per year.

Ample fuel to continue growing

Enbridge has paid dividends to its investors for nearly seven decades. The Canadian pipeline and utility giant has increased its payout every year for the past 29.

The company should have plenty of fuel to continue increasing its dividend, which yields a monster 7.5% these days, for the next several years. It's in the process of closing a once-in-a-generation acquisition of three high-quality gas utilities in the United States. That deal will immediately boost its earnings, enhance its diversification and income stability, and add to its growth profile.

In addition, the company has a robust organic growth backlog. It has billions of dollars in commercially secured projects under construction that should come online through 2028. These projects should help grow its cash flow per share by 3% annually through 2026 and by a roughly 5% per year pace after that. That visible earnings growth, along with its top-notch financial profile, positions Enbridge to continue increasing its dividend each year.

High-quality income stocks

Realty Income, Brookfield Infrastructure, and Enbridge are my ideal income stocks. They pay well above-average dividends, and those payouts should continue rising steadily in the future. Those factors are driving my decision to continue buying these top-notch income stocks hand over fist in July.

Should you invest $1,000 in Enbridge right now?

On Bogleheads.org, a post titled ""Let me retire! Please?"" sparked a discussion about early retirement viability.

A couple from Pennsylvania, aged 56 and 54, is contemplating quitting their high-paying jobs to pursue volunteer activities. With a 14-year-old child, the couple seeks advice on whether their financial situation can support a sustainable retirement in a high-cost-of-living (HCOL) area.

Don't Miss:

The couple has a combined income of $450,000 in 2024 and expects to spend $180,000 annually post-2025. They have an effective federal tax rate of 24% and a state tax rate of 3.07%. Their total portfolio is $5.1 million, and they allocated 55% to stocks (20% international), 30% to bonds, and 15% to cash. They are primarily invested in Vanguard and Schwab funds with an expense ratio of 0.10%. They have no debt or mortgage, and their projected Social Security benefits are $35,000 for him at age 70 and $19,000 for her at age 62.

Several forum members provided their perspectives on the couple's retirement plan. The consensus is optimistic, with some variations in opinion on portfolio risk and spending flexibility.

One user noted, ""As long as your expenses are accurate, you should be fine. You are a touch on the conservative side with your investments, but you would likely be fine even without Social Security, providing a buffer for you."" Applying the 4% rule, which suggests a safe withdrawal rate of 4% of the portfolio, the couple could potentially withdraw $204,000 annually. This aligns well with their predicted spending of $180,000, leaving some room for unexpected expenses or market downturns.

Another user asked, ""What is the breakout of your portfolio (401(k), brokerage, Roth, etc.)? How much help do you intend to give your 14-year-old for college and later?"" Clarifications were requested regarding the breakdown of their portfolio and college funding plans for their child.

Trending: This Jeff Bezos-backed startup will allow you to become a landlord in just 10 minutes, and you only need $100.

Some forum members noted that the couple's current 55/45 asset allocation is somewhat conservative but within a safe range. One member suggested, ""I would therefore also suggest that you up your equities from 55% to 60%. Move that money from bonds to equities, not cash to equities.""

Story continues

The 4% rule, while a good guideline, may need adjustments given the couple's early retirement age and long retirement horizon. Another member commented, ""A 3.5% withdrawal rate is nearly guaranteed to last you 30 years with that asset allocation.""

The couple needs to remain flexible with their spending, especially in response to market fluctuations. One user advised, ""Make yourself a ‘retirement spending' list. This can be quite different from ‘while working.'""

Health care costs could increase significantly before Medicare kicks in. Another user asked, ""Have you researched costs when you're both on Medicare?""

Trending: Elon Musk and Jeff Bezos are bullish on one city that could dethrone New York and become the new financial capital of the US. Investing in its booming real estate market has never been more accessible.

It's important to understand these expenses and factor them into the retirement budget. College expenses for their child should also be planned for, ensuring they don't derail their retirement plans. Exploring Roth conversions and understanding ACA subsidies until Medicare eligibility could provide additional tax advantages and cost savings.

The couple appears well-positioned for early retirement, provided they maintain flexibility in their spending and remain vigilant about potential market changes. Their financial situation allows for a comfortable retirement, but ongoing assessment and potential adjustments to their portfolio and spending will be crucial for long-term success.

Would you feel confident about retiring now if you were in their shoes?

If you're uncertain about your early retirement plans or think you may need to address specific financial goals, consider consulting a financial advisor. They can help create a personalized plan tailored to your unique situation.

Some stocks remain beaten down, well below the highs reached in late 2021 and early 2022.

Some of the companies behind those stocks benefited from the behavior changes ushered in by the COVID-19 pandemic. But as things start to resemble the way things were pre-pandemic, they don't look as attractive. Others, however, look oversold, and their current valuations don't reflect their true potential.

One example of the latter is PayPal (NASDAQ: PYPL). PayPal's share price surged as COVID-19 drove more online and contactless sales. But a couple of bad quarters and a CEO change led to a massive sell-off in shares. The stock currently trades around 81% below the all-time high it reached in mid-2021. Here's why it may be a great opportunity to buy up some shares.

Image source: Getty Images.

It's already showing signs of a turnaround

One of the biggest things weighing on PayPal over the past year was its declining active account total. Active accounts peaked in the fourth quarter of 2022 and experienced four consecutive sequential declines during 2023.

But active accounts increased in the first quarter, climbing 2 million to reach 427 million total. While there's still a long way to go to get back to where it was at the end of 2022, the turnaround progress is encouraging.

The biggest driver of the active account decline was churn from inactive accounts in emerging markets in the Latin America and Asia Pacific regions. It's now growing by adding users who are spending more and more frequently. Total payment volume was up 14% year over year despite fewer users than this time last year. Transactions per active account over the past year reached an all-time high of 60.

The virtuous cycle driving strong engagement growth

The growing engagement of PayPal users signals its network advantage. On one side of the network are consumers and on the other side are merchants. The massive consumer base using PayPal draws more merchants to accept the digital wallet and the growing number of merchants taking PayPal draws more consumers to the platform. A growing number of merchants also gives existing users more opportunities to use PayPal.

There's good reason for merchants to choose PayPal, too. Not only does it add another payment option for around 400 million online shoppers, but it also makes them more likely to complete a transaction. The company reports a 33% increase in checkout conversions when the buyer uses PayPal versus another form of payment.

Story continues

While PayPal faces competition, none of its competitors has a user base the size of PayPal. That makes it practically indispensable for online merchants.

That said, fierce competition can and has weighed on PayPal's ability to charge higher fees for merchants. It also pushed the company to allow more consumer choice in its default payments, instead of forcing them to pay using methods more lucrative for the company (like cash balances).

Still, it's hard to deny PayPal's position as the leading digital wallet, putting it in a prime position for the continued secular growth in e-commerce.

The stock is an absolute bargain

The stock currently trades for a forward price-to-earnings ratio below 14x. That's incredibly low, even if you expect competition to eat into its revenue growth and margins.

Management's updated full-year 2024 guidance calls for mid- to high-single-digit earnings-per-share (EPS) growth. PayPal should be able to drive double-digit revenue growth as it returns to year-over-year active account growth this year. While non-branded checkout has weighed on its gross margin, it's cutting costs in other areas, which should result in stable to growing operating margins. That could mean PayPal exceeds its current full-year outlook.

What's more, PayPal is aggressively buying back shares at this price. It forecasts $5 billion in free cash flow, and management plans to repurchase even more than $5 billion in shares this year. That provides a further boost to earnings per share.

Wall Street analysts currently expect PayPal to grow its earnings per share at a compound annual rate of almost 16% over the next five years as a result of the above factors. So, with shares trading under 14x earnings, they present an incredible bargain for investors.

One such couple recently sought advice from financial expert Suze Orman on whether to buy a home or rent a luxury senior apartment.

The husband and wife are financially secure, with a combined monthly income of over $9,000 from pensions and Social Security, savings of around $100,000, and $850,000 in an IRA, annuity, and Roth account.

Don't Miss:

The average American couple has saved this much money for retirement — How do you compare ?

Warren Buffett once said, ""If you don't find a way to make money while you sleep, you will work until you die."" These high-yield real estate notes that pay 7.5% – 9% make earning passive income easier than ever.

Orman first highlighted the couple's solid financial standing, noting they have no debt and can sell their current home for $450,000 to $500,000 without incurring capital gains tax. This financial freedom means buying or renting isn't strictly about money but lifestyle preferences and practical considerations.

She pointed out the physical demands of home maintenance as a significant factor for retirees. ""They are in their seventies and are not sure if they are up to the challenge of daily housekeeping maintenance at their age,"" she said. KT KT echoed these concerns, highlighting that such tasks become increasingly burdensome as people age.

""After 70, you start to feel it,"" KT remarked, highlighting the importance of considering one's physical capabilities when deciding on living arrangements.

The couple is torn between the husband's preference for buying a home and the wife's inclination toward a luxury senior community apartment. The wife enjoys socializing and traveling, benefiting from the amenities and services such communities provide.

Suze Orman provided a compelling argument for the wife's choice, focusing on the benefits of senior community living. ""You have a community around you,"" she said, recounting the positive experiences of both her mother and KT's mother in similar settings. These communities offer various activities and social opportunities, such as happy hours, educational classes, movies, swimming, and golf.

Trending: Elon Musk and Jeff Bezos are bullish on one city that could dethrone New York and become the new financial capital of the US. Investing in its booming real estate market has never been more accessible.

Orman stressed the importance of moving to a senior community while both partners are healthy. ""In most cases, you can't move in if one of you is seriously ill,"" she advised, urging the couple to make the transition sooner rather than later. She also noted women’s higher life expectancy, which could leave the wife managing a house alone if her husband passes away first.

Story continues

Orman humorously warned, ""Your husband probably shouldn't hear this part of the answer,"" referring to the predominantly female demographics of senior communities and the social perks for the few men who live there.

Financial experts often advise evaluating the costs and benefits of both options for seniors with existing homes like this couple. Selling a house can free up equity that can be used to fund other retirement needs or investments while renting can simplify life by eliminating the need for ongoing maintenance and large, unexpected expenses.

While buying a home can offer stability, and potential equity growth, renting may provide a more carefree lifestyle, especially valuable in the later stages of life.

Financially, the couple can afford either option. Orman, however, leaned toward the wife's preference for a senior community, emphasizing its convenience and reduced responsibilities. She advised the husband to ""listen to your wife here because, in the long run, you're gonna be so happy that you did.""

If you’re exploring options for your retirement living arrangements, remember that the right choice depends on your individual needs and priorities. Consider factors like home maintenance, social engagement, and desired lifestyle when making this important decision. Consulting with a financial advisor can provide valuable guidance and ensure you make the best choice for your golden years.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - Global hedge funds in June sold U.S. shares of technology, media and telecommunications (TMT) companies at the fastest pace since 2016, mainly driven by semiconductor stocks, Goldman Sachs said in note.

The sales could indicate that portfolio managers have become more bearish on tech stocks, after the sector's powerful rally in the first half of the year, although the note does not provide any reason behind the trend.

The bank, which compiles its clients' positioning for the data, said semiconductor and software were the top two most sold sectors in June, while hedge funds increased their allocation to tech hardware and electronic equipment.

Tech stocks led the S&P 500 index's strong performance in the first half of the year, with artificial intelligence chipmaker Nvidia up 150% and generating 30% of the index's 15% return.

Overall, Goldman Sachs said hedge funds net sold global equities for a third straight month, almost entirely driven by short sellers who borrowed shares to sell on bets that the price will decline, enabling them to buy them back for less.

Yahoo Finance,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/1-solid-ai-stock-thats-135300108.html,2024-07-01,13:53:00 UTC,1 Solid AI Stock That's Not Nvidia to Keep an Eye On in the Second Half of 2024,"Artificial intelligence (AI) is undoubtedly one of the biggest trends in our generation, one that could rival (some argue even surpass) that of the internet.

The rise of AI would lift many companies to new heights while sending some to the brink of extinction. For instance, Nvidia, a leading supplier of graphics processing units (GPUs) for AI computation, saw its market capitalization briefly surpass Microsoft to become the most-valuable company in the world before retreating slightly to occupy the second place.

While Nvidia is an obvious candidate, investors looking to invest in the AI trend should not place all their eggs in one basket. Fortunately, the AI tailwind should benefit many other companies beyond Nvidia -- and one of them is Palantir (NYSE: PLTR).

Image source: Getty Images.

Palantir has a sticky business model

If one were asked to name a top tech company, Palantir would unlikely be a top choice -- and for good reason. It's not a consumer tech-facing company like Amazon or Alphabet, or a small and medium-sized business-facing software company like Shopify. Palantir's primary customers are big organizations, mainly governments and massive corporations.

Founded in 2003, Palantir initially focused on building software for the U.S. government in counterterrorism operations. Its early success led to further expansion of its products to other governments globally. The company entered the commercial market at a later stage, leveraging its expertise and experience gained from serving government clients.

Palantir's value proposition to customers (where the majority are still governments) is relatively straightforward (though by no means easy to deliver). It helps them gather vast volumes of data from everywhere (internal and external), analyze the data with its software platform, and make critical operational decisions. Palantir's software tools must be robust, scalable, and reliable since they help clients make crucial decisions -- some of which are matters of life and death.

Besides, Palantir must tailor its software to match the needs of its customers. For instance, a local government agency will have completely different requirements from the defense department. So, while Palantir can leverage its common software platform and experience, it must tailor solutions to help various customers tackle their respective operations.

Given these reasons, Palantir's products can be highly sticky among its customers. The enormous financial and human resources needed to implement this software -- such as installation, integration, and training -- create a huge switching cost for clients. So long as the software continues to work, it makes little sense to consider switching providers.

Story continues

Also, Palantir usually enters into a long-term contract with clients, further improving its revenue stickiness. As of Dec. 31, 2023, existing contracts last 3.4 years, up from 2.8 years from the previous year. Moreover, existing customers usually spend more money with Palantir over time. For instance, the top-20 customers paid an average of $54.6 million in 2023, up 11% from $49.4 million a year earlier.

AI is set to propel Palantir's business in 2024 and beyond

Palantir's early track record in helping the U.S. government is an excellent springboard for it to build a massive business around government agencies. While impressive, this segment will unlikely propel Palantir to the next level. Instead, the software company must grow its commercial segment.

To put it into perspective, 55% of Palantir's 2023 revenue came from the government segment, with the remaining 45% from the commercial sector (up from 44 % in 2020). Herein lies a challenge: Palantir's ability to quickly scale its commercial segment further.

Don't get me wrong. There's nothing wrong with having a significant and robust government business, especially since many of these relationships are incredibly sticky. However, Palantir's largest opportunities lie in the commercial segment.

And that's where AI will play a significant role in shaping Palantir's next growth phase. In particular, the increase in awareness of AI, especially with the proliferation of generative AI apps like ChatGPT since 2023, has given the market a taste of what AI can do to their work and personal lives. This awareness raises the urgency for companies to implement the latest AI tools to improve their operations or risk losing to their competitors.

Palantir has multiple ways to win. One is that it can leverage its existing client relationships to upsell its AI solutions. This approach will be the most straightforward since customers have invested heavily in using Palantir's platform, so they can quickly run new AI models by leveraging existing data infrastructure.

On top of that, Palantir can leverage the near-term market excitement to recruit new customers. To this end, Palantir leverages its AIP Bootcamps to allow potential clients to try its AI platform for free, giving them a real taste of how AI can improve their business operations. So, customers get to see precisely what they can get out of the software without paying anything in advance, which should improve conversion rates.

While still early, there are already tangible signs that AI could be transformative for Palantir. For instance, Palantir's U.S. commercial revenue surged 40% year over year in the first quarter of 2024, and closed U.S. commercial deals jumped 94% year over year. Comparatively, companywide revenue rose by just 21%. Better still, this trend could continue for many years.

What it means for investors

Investors constantly seek the next megatrend which could shape society and generate massive wealth over long periods.

That's how Amazon, a young upstart from nowhere in the 1990s, became one of the most-valuable companies on the planet by leveraging the internet tailwind. That same tailwind led to the rise of tech companies like Alphabet and Meta Platform.

Similarly, AI would undoubtedly create new tech giants. Investors should, therefore, keep a watchlist of potential winners. Palantir should be on that list.

US stocks rose Monday, extending bullish momentum into the year's second half.

The 10-year Treasury yield spiked 13 basis points to 4.479%.

Investors are eyeing the Friday's upcoming jobs report to gauge where interest rates are headed.

US stocks ended higher on Monday to start the second half of the year, rising even as bond yields soared during the session.

Stocks wrapped up the first half of 2024 with strong gains, with the S&P 500 up 14% and Nasdaq Composite up 18%. Strength among tech stocks and investor confidence that the Federal Reserve will cut interest rates this year should keep the momentum going. However, fear has mounted around concentration in the market, as just a handful of stocks have been helping to drive the market to record highs.

Meanwhile, shifting outlooks on the US election have added uncertainty to the bond market, and yields on the 10-year Treasury surgedon Monday. After candidate Joe Biden and Donald Trump debated on Thursday, odds of a Trump win rose about 6 percentage points, Goldman Sachs reported. Traders were also assessing volatility stemming from European elections as right-wing candidates in France led in the first round of the general election.

The 10-year Treasury yield spiked 12 basis points to 4.469%.

Federal Reserve officials Jerome Powell and John Williams are scheduled to speak this week, setting the tone ahead of this month's policy meeting. However, investor attention will primarily be drawn to June's job report, scheduled to be released on Friday. Economists project 190,000 positions added last month, a cooldown from May.

Any surprises to expectations for jobs added last month could weigh on the Fed's future monetary policy. At present, markets expect rate cuts to start in November, CME FedWatch Tool data shows.

Yahoo Finance,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/intel-stock-down-141500452.html,2024-07-01,14:15:00 UTC,"Intel Stock Is Down, but Is It Also Out?","Intel (NASDAQ: INTC) is a stock that investors could easily dismiss. The longtime leader in the semiconductor industry has been eclipsed by Nvidia and AMD -- and amid the staggering costs of entering the foundry business, many investors have turned their backs on the chipmaker.

The good news for Intel is that artificial intelligence (AI) has led to a massive spike in semiconductor demand. This and the enormous government subsidies highlight why Intel stock should eventually return to growth. Plus, a largely overlooked factor should help ensure that success.

Intel's saving grace

Amid its entry into the foundry business, Intel may succeed simply because the government needs it to succeed. Here's why.

Currently, Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing (TSMC) is the leading chip producer, with about two-thirds of the world's semiconductor production taking place in Taiwan, according to TrendForce. This is gravely concerning to the U.S. government because of Taiwan's proximity to China and its longtime threats to invade the island.

Hence, the U.S. and other countries have offered tens of billions of dollars in subsidies to chipmakers like Intel to manufacture chips at home. Admittedly, Intel lags behind TSMC and Samsung technologically, and both of those companies are building foundries in the U.S.

Nonetheless, Intel has more foundries in the U.S. than any other company. Also, besides TSMC and Samsung, Intel is the only company buying the advanced equipment from ASML necessary to build the world's most advanced chips. The purchase of ASML's most advanced equipment is part of CEO Pat Gelsinger's effort to make Intel the technology leader in the chip industry again.

Intel's challenges

The company's plan to become the technological leader by next year is unlikely to come to pass. However, it has made improvements in an attempt to recover the lead it lost to longtime rival AMD.

Also, the company announced the Gaudi 3 Accelerator, an AI chip it hopes can compete with Nvidia. While Intel touts its advantages over Nvidia's Hopper H100 chip, Nvidia has already moved on to the Blackwell B200, likely ensuring that Nvidia will retain its technical lead.

Moreover, Intel will probably continue to struggle financially for the foreseeable future. While its first-quarter 2024 revenue of almost $13 billion rose 11% compared to the same quarter last year, free cash flow was negative $6.2 billion.That's because Intel spent almost $6 billion in Q1 on property and equipment. Since it claims only $21 billion in liquidity, it may have to issue more shares or additional debt if its financials do not improve.

Story continues

Still, amid a nearly 40% decline in the stock price since the beginning of the year, Intel stock has become a bargain in one critical measure -- the price-to-book value ratio. At just over 1.2 times book value, Intel stock is priced slightly above the value of its stockholders' equity.

In comparison, AMD sells at 4.6 times its book value, and Nvidia trades at a staggering price-to-book value ratio of 62. Hence, Intel's rock-bottom valuation could entice investors to buy Intel stock when one also considers its efforts to compete.

Investing in Intel

Ultimately, government backing and the desire to produce chips in the U.S. should become a tailwind for Intel stock. Admittedly, the company has fallen behind the peers it dominated in past decades.

However, Intel has shown that it will do what it takes to become one of the most advanced chip producers. Also, thanks to the U.S. government's desire for a homegrown chip manufacturing industry, Intel's foundry footprint may make its success critical to the U.S. government, increasing the likelihood it will win in the marketplace.

This means that even if Intel lags Nvidia in the AI chip space, its efforts to close the technological gap could improve its top line in the foreseeable future. With the market valuing the stock at little more than the value of its assets minus liabilities, patient, long-term investors could benefit by taking a position in Intel at current levels.

From alternative music and alternative cinema, millennials and Gen Z have moved on to alternative assets. And they're hoarding their way over the recommended amount. A mind-blowing 31% of their portfolios are in alternatives, which would make most financial advisors gasp for air. But are they right to do so?

Don't Miss:

Bank of America recently surveyed 1,000 Gen Z and millennial investors with over $3 million in assets, excluding primary residence. The results were starkly different from those of their older counterparts.

A striking 72% of investors aged 21 to 43 ""believe it is no longer possible to achieve above-average investment returns by investing solely in traditional stocks and bonds."" In contrast, only 28% of investors over 44 share this sentiment.

And the youth isn't just talking the talk: they allocate only 28% of their portfolios to stocks, compared to 55% for older investors. Instead, they are increasingly turning to alternative investments, which makes perfect sense from their perspective. How are you supposed to believe in the stability of stocks after they've crashed twice in your lifetime? First in 2000 and then in 2008. To them, investing your savings in something that can easily go away in a split second is only worth it if it comes with greater potential gains. That's where real estate, crypto, and private equity enter the picture.

Trending: Warren Buffett once said, ""If you don't find a way to make money while you sleep, you will work until you die."" These high-yield real estate notes that pay 7.5% – 9% make earning passive income easier than ever.

Real Estate — A Solid Foundation

Conventional investment categories include stocks, bonds, and cash, which makes real estate an alternative asset. With the volatility of the stock market, real estate offers a tangible asset that can provide stable returns over time. It has historically been one of the most secure ways to create wealth if you have the patience to wait for five to 10 years. Real estate investments can range from residential properties to commercial real estate, and investing in them has never been easier. By the end of the day, you can become a part-owner of individual properties through fractional investing or invest in funds that can net passive income for many years in the future.

Crypto — The Digital Frontier

Another asset younger investors are bullish on is cryptocurrencies. Since the first Bitcoin was minted in 2008, the crypto market has grown exponentially, making everyone who bought thousands of the early digital coins very rich a few years later. Today, it continues to offer impressive returns, especially after wider adoption. Crypto is being increasingly used worldwide, which grants more stability and higher returns for those invested. Still, crypto markets are highly volatile, so it's important to educate yourself on the topic before you dive in. Luckily, most crypto exchanges offer free courses on what crypto is and what makes it 100x from time to time.

Private Equity — Tapping Into High-Growth Opportunities

Investing in private equity essentially means buying shares of startups before they go public. Today, they're taking longer than ever to become tradable, which makes them particularly attractive. Add to that the AI transformation and the fact hundreds of future billion-dollar companies have less than 10 employees today, and it becomes easy to see why private equity is extremely popular. However, most private companies aren't open to regular investors. They usually only rely on VC firms, hedge funds, and angel investors.

This can been seen in the performance of major sector exchange-traded funds (ETFs) such as the Alerian Energy Infrastructure ETF (NYSEMKT: ENFR), up about 18% year to date, and the Alerian MLP ETF (NYSEMKT: AMLP), up nearly 17%. The latter only includes the stocks of midstream companies structured as master limited partnerships (MLPs), while the former includes midstream companies structured as both MLPs and corporations.

While the first half of the year has been a good one for the sector, there is strong reason to believe a number of stocks in the space could be set to outperform in the second half and beyond.

Lets look at three midstream stocks set to outperform the rest of this year and into the future.

MPLX

MPLX (NYSE: MPLX) is a midstream company involved in logistics and storage as well as gathering and processing (G&P). Refiner Marathon Petroleum owns approximately 65% of the company and represents just under 50% of its revenue.

The stock sports an attractive 8% yield based on its most recent distribution and had a robust 1.6 times coverage ratio in the first quarter of 2024. Meanwhile, its balance sheet is in good shape with a leverage ratio (net debt/adjusted EBITDA) of just 3.2 times. The company has been a consistent performer, raising its base distribution each year since 2012.

The company is well positioned in both Appalachia (Marcellus and Utica) and the Permian, and has a robust pipeline of growth projects in both regions over the next few years. It is planning to spend $950 million in growth capital expenditure (capex) this year. The company also recently acquired some G&P assets in the Utica and entered into an agreement to merge the Whistler Pipeline and Rio Bravo Pipeline projects into a new joint venture in order to link Permian supply to additional Gulf Coast demand, which it believes will lead to future growth opportunities. <

Situated in the right basins, MPLX looks in good shape to continue growing its distributions, while its forward enterprise value (EV)-to-EBITDA (earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization) valuation of 9.6 times (one of the most common ways to value midstream stocks) is attractive and well below the 13.7 times multiple the sector traded at between 2011 to 2016.

Western Midstream

One of the best-performing midstream stocks in the first half of the year was Western Midstream (NYSE: WES), which was up around 35%. The company primarily services Occidental Petroleum's gathering and processing (G&P) needs in the Delaware Permian, Powder River Basin (PRB), and Denver-Julesburg (DJ) basins.

Story continues

The company started the year strong, recording record Q1 adjusted EBITDA of $609 million that was up 22%, while its free cash flow soared 60% to $225 million. This prompted Western to say it expected its adjusted EBITDA to come in at the high end of its previous guidance calling for full-year adjusted EBITDA of between $2.2 billion and $2.4 billion.

Impressively, the company increased its quarterly distribution by 52% from $0.575 per unit to $0.875. Based on this distribution, the stock now yields about 8.9%. Western appears on track to reach its leverage (net debt/adjusted EBITDA) goal of 3 times by year end, at which point it could pay out excess (special or variable) distributions above its current $0.875 quarterly based payout. That would likely help propel the stock even higher and set it up to continue to outperform.

Meanwhile, with a forward EV-to-EBITDA valuation of 9.6 times, the stock is trading at an attractive valuation that is well below historical levels.

Energy Transfer (ET)

One of the stocks best positioned to benefit from increasing power consumption stemming from artificial intelligence (AI), meanwhile, is Energy Transfer (NYSE: ET). The company has the largest integrated midstream system in the country with strong positions in low-cost natural gas-producing regions, particularly the Permian. As primarily a prolific oil-producing basin, the associated natural gas that comes from production in the Permian is some of the cheapest in the country, which is likely to draw many new data centers to the region given the immense energy that is needed to power AI.

Energy Transfer already has one of the most robust growth-project backlogs in the midstream space, with the company expecting to spend nearly $3 billion in growth capex this year. Projects related to AI energy consumption are only likely to increase that backlog in the future.

At the same time, the company has repaired its balance sheet to nicely lower its leverage, while carrying a high distribution-coverage ratio of over 2 times last quarter.

Trading at a forward EV/EBITDA ratio of just 7.4 times, Energy Transfer is a cheap stock with a lot of potential growth in front of it. That's why it is my favorite midstream stock to outperform in the second half of 2024 and beyond.

Yahoo Finance,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/2-artificial-intelligence-ai-stocks-220000723.html,2024-07-01,22:00:00 UTC,2 Artificial Intelligence (AI) Stocks Trading Under $30 That Can Supercharge Your Portfolio,"Semiconductor giant Nvidia has added $2.6 trillion to its market capitalization since the beginning of 2023, soaking up most of the value created by the artificial intelligence (AI) industry so far.

However, professional investor Cathie Wood believes software companies will eventually generate $8 in revenue for every $1 spent on chips from the likes of Nvidia, which could create a substantial opportunity for investors.

C3.ai (NYSE: AI) and Lemonade (NYSE: LMND) were developing AI software long before the hype took hold last year. Shares in both companies trade at under $30; here's why they could supercharge your stock portfolio over the long term.

1. C3.ai

C3.ai was the world's first enterprise AI company when it was founded in 2009. It now has a portfolio of more than 40 ready-made and customizable AI applications used by businesses in 19 different industries, which helps them reap the benefits of the technology without having to build it from the ground up themselves.

Dow is a chemical manufacturing giant that uses C3.ai's applications for predictive maintenance. AI monitors Dow's equipment to calculate the probability of a failure, allowing engineers to remedy any issues before they become critical. Dow says C3.ai has reduced its downtime by 20%, which directly impacts production volume, revenue, and profitability.

Similarly, Georgia Pacific (which manufactures paper, packaging, and building materials) has rolled out C3.ai's Reliability platform to monitor over 200 large production assets, with plans to expand the partnership further. Georgia Pacific has already seen a 5% increase in equipment efficiency, and management says employees now spend 80% of their time solving problems rather than looking for them.

C3.ai sells its applications directly to businesses, but it also sells them through its extensive partnership network which includes all major cloud platforms like Microsoft Azure and Amazon Web Services. Those partners offer C3.ai's applications to their customers to give them more AI options, and C3.ai gets the benefit of accessing a much larger pool of businesses.

In the recent fiscal 2024 fourth quarter (ended April 30), C3.ai had 487 customer engagements, which was a whopping 70% increase from the year-ago period, highlighting the fast-growing demand for AI in the corporate world. The company's revenue hit a record high of $86.6 million during the quarter, marking a 20% increase, its fastest growth in almost two years. According to management's forecast, revenue growth could accelerate further to 23% in the upcoming fiscal 2025 first quarter (ending July 31).

Story continues

C3.ai trades at $28.55 per share as of the close on June 27, which is an 82% discount to its all-time high from the 2020 tech frenzy. Its valuation was completely unreasonable back then, but the company has grown consistently ever since, with more customers and an expanding product portfolio. Now might be a great time to buy in.

2. Lemonade

Lemonade has developed AI since it was founded in 2015 with an aim to disrupt the insurance industry, which is dominated by large, entrenched companies. Lemonade uses AI across its entire business; it autonomously writes quotes, pays claims, calculates premiums, and even identifies areas where the company is underperforming.

Lemonade's AI chatbot, Maya, can write quotes for potential customers in under 90 seconds via the company's website. Its AI bot, Jim, can pay claims in under three minutes without human assistance. That speedy, tech-centric approach to service helped Lemonade attract over 2 million customers so far, and it's successfully acquiring younger cohorts in the 19 to 34 age bracket, which have historically been underinsured.

Internally, Lemonade's Lifetime Value (LTV) AI models use swaths of data to calculate a customer's likelihood of making a claim, switching insurers, and buying multiple policies, to ensure it charges the most accurate premium.

Plus, those models help reduce costs. The company's loss-adjusted expense (LAE) ratio -- which measures the cost of managing claims -- is 7.6%, whereas 10% is typical across the industry. In fact, Lemonade's insurance book has grown 22% over the past year at the same time the company shrank its workforce by 11%, which highlights the power of AI.

During the first quarter of 2024 (ended March 31), Lemonade's in-force premiums (the total value of all active policies) hit a record high of $794 million, representing an increase of 21.5% from the year-ago period. Its gross loss ratio (the percentage of its premiums paid out as claims) also fell eight percentage points to 79% and is now in the ballpark of the company's long-term target of 75%.

Those metrics resulted in a record $119.1 million in revenue during Q1, up 25% from the year-ago period. Lemonade is still generating losses at the bottom line, but they are shrinking, and management expects the company to be cash-flow positive by the end of this year. However, pulling back on expenses could lead to slower revenue growth and delay an expansion beyond its five existing segments: renters, homeowners, life, pet, and car insurance.

Nevertheless, reaching profitability will be a key milestone that could give investors confidence in Lemonade's ability to operate a thriving, sustainable business over the long term. Its stock closed at $16.46 on June 27, which was an 89% discount to its all-time high. Like C3.ai, Lemonade was swept up in the tech frenzy during 2021, and its valuation soared to unsustainable heights. With the company making clear progress since then, the steep drop could be a great opportunity to buy the stock.

Yahoo Finance,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/world-most-volatile-big-stock-000000787.html,2024-07-02,00:00:00 UTC,World’s Most Volatile Big Stock Is Rocking Indonesia’s Market,"(Bloomberg) -- Its share-price chart resembles that of an emerging-market penny stock: a 1,200% surge punctuated by two crashes of more than 40% — all in the span of less than nine months.

Most Read from Bloomberg

But PT Barito Renewables Energy is Indonesia’s biggest company by market capitalization - an $85 billion geothermal power producer controlled by one of the country’s richest tycoons.

Barito’s wild swings – the most extreme among companies worldwide valued at $50 billion or more based on 30-day volatility – have perplexed professional analysts, stoked fevered trading among retail investors and challenged regulators’ attempts to bring more order to an increasingly volatile market.

The episode is offering a fresh reminder to international money managers on the lack of transparency that sometimes comes with investing in Indonesia’s $735 billion stock market. Barito has said little that might explain why its shares have swung so much, while authorities have refrained from disclosing specifics behind trading curbs implemented late May that critics say have exacerbated the stock’s volatility.

The trading restrictions “intended for investor protection ironically undermined broader investor confidence,” said Mohit Mirpuri, a fund manager at Singapore-based SGMC Capital Pte. “In the near term, this situation will likely deter risk-averse investors, especially if perceived as indicative of broader market instability or regulatory challenges.”

The controversy dates back to last June when the stock exchange launched a new watchlist for volatile and troubled companies. The board was envisioned as a carefully-crafted cure-all by regulators to return credibility to Southeast Asia’s largest stock market, which had been plagued by high volatility and shrinking liquidity. Under exchange rules, a company can be added to the watchlist for several reasons, including zero revenue growth, thin liquidity and trading under 51 rupiah for three months.

In March, the bourse amped up pressure on such companies by implementing a “full call auction” on all watchlist firms. The mechanism matches buy and sell orders, as is commonly used by major exchanges around the world during the start and close of trading. However, instead of transitioning to continuous trading, the auction would be implemented at four or five times through the day.

Story continues

At first, the restrictions were met with little fanfare. That is until the Indonesia Stock Exchange placed Barito Renewables on the list in late May, without offering any specific reasoning beyond citing the “significant increase” in the share price.

The response from the market was swift. In the subsequent two weeks, shares of the company tumbled by almost half, wiping out some 700 trillion rupiah ($43 billion) and dragging down the benchmark Jakarta Stock Exchange Composite Index by nearly 5%. The gyrations spurred FTSE Russell to delay the company’s inclusion into its large cap index that would have led to new foreign inflows.

The inclusion also angered local traders, who argued that it hurt market stability and dampened returns. In an act of defiance, they sent dozens of funeral flower arrangements to the exchange’s office, urging death to the auction. A petition on Change.org signed by 16,000 users is calling for its revocation.

The exchange has defended the restrictions, arguing that it has increased price discovery for several penny stocks and increased liquidity. Financial Services Authority Capital Market Supervisor Inarno Djajadi said the regulator is benchmarking its policies with similar rules in other countries.

Billionaire owner Prajogo Pangestu has since purchased some 48 million more shares, which had surged as much as 1,342% since its public market debut last October in one of the country’s most anticipated listings. The firm’s corporate secretary Merly said in a statement that Prajogo’s stake increase reflects his confidence in the firm’s prospects.

Late last month, after massive outcry, the regulator removed Barito Renewables from the watchlist without further explanation. Exchange Director Jeffrey Hendrik told reporters that the removal of a number of stocks was thanks to improved liquidity.

Barito Renewables only has one company analyst rating, according to Bloomberg data. The firm is majority-owned by PT Barito Pacific, which is majority-owned by Prajogo. It’s trading at 637 times 12-month forward earnings, more than three times Adani Green Energy Ltd. Earlier this year, Indonesia’s bourse checked on whether there was any stock manipulation in another firm owned by Prajogo that had surged more than 6,000% since listing.

Investors worry that entering the watchlist can create a knee-jerk reaction among traders. Four companies under MNC Group were placed onto the watchlist at the end of May, including PT MNC Asia Holding. That stock tumbled 60% in the two weeks after the placement. Shares of restaurant manager PT Sari Kreasi Boga plummeted nearly 70% within 3 weeks of inclusion in the same month.

“Once shares enter the (full call auction), it’s like being in a dark prison, so people are in panic selling,” said Hasan Zein Mahmud, a former director of the exchange and investor in Sari Kreasi.

Analysts say the uncertainty will accelerate an exodus of foreign capital. Broad macro concerns about uncertain fiscal policy and a weak rupiah have already prompted Morgan Stanley and HSBC Holdings Plc to downgrade the country’s stocks last month.

“The (full call auction) rule might be beneficial for small, penny stocks. But large ones like Barito, it may actually deter investors, especially foreign funds given the less transparent and market-driven process,” said Sufianti, an analyst at Bloomberg Intelligence.

Undoubtedly, much of this recent rally has been fueled by the company's position as a key beneficiary and enabler of the ongoing artificial intelligence (AI) wave.

Nvidia offers a full-stack AI platform, comprising cutting-edge AI-optimized hardware chips, a complete software ecosystem, high-speed networking solutions, and servers to enable clients to build ""AI factories,"" or the essential infrastructure for AI-based outputs (text, images, audio, video). The company's accelerated product release cadence, from two years to one year, also helps it maintain technological superiority against competition.

Furthermore, besides the booming demand from large hyperscale companies, enterprises, and AI start-ups, Nvidia's AI-optimized hardware and software solutions are now increasingly used in new areas such as Sovereign AI (governments building domestic AI capabilities), automotive vertical, and robotics business.

The AI frenzy propelled Nvidia's stock to an all-time high of over $1,200 in early June. Its recently executed 10-for-1 stock split made its stock far more accessible to retail investors.

With Nvidia's stock now around $124 at this writing, long-term investors may be keen to know if the stock can again jump to $1,000-plus levels. Let's analyze the company's fundamentals and valuations to find some answers.

Intensifying competition and supply challenges

Nvidia's technological superiority in developing AI-optimized hardware and software enabled the company to capture a whopping 90% share of the global AI chip market. However, the company's stronghold may get challenged in the long run. Although currently far behind Nvidia, competitors Advanced Micro Devices and Intel are working hard to capture a slice of the AI market.

AMD's MI300 family of data center chips witnessed strong demand, while the company is also gearing up for launching families of AI chips such as MI325 and MI350 accelerators, based on advanced architectures, in the coming months. AMD expects these chips to demonstrate faster performance, improved memory capacity, and stronger computing capabilities for AI workloads.

Intel is also aggressively focusing on the AI PC opportunity and hopes to launch Lunar Lake laptop CPUs by September 2024. Lunar Lake chips are expected to be superior in performance, efficiency, and graphics processing compared to their predecessor Meteor Lake chips. Plus, Intel has also introduced Gaudi 3 AI accelerators, offering superior cost-performance benefits for training and inferencing of AI models.

Story continues

Nvidia also faces the risk of customers such as cloud players and technology giants becoming competitors, as they have been accelerating in-house development of AI-optimized chips and solutions. This risk cannot be ignored, since large cloud players account for roughly 45% of the company's data center revenues.

Multiple other challenges

While demand for Nvidia's AI chips and solutions has grown dramatically, the company continues to face supply constraints associated with procuring manufacturing, testing, and packaging capacity from Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing and other vendors. Subsequently, the company expects demand for its new H200 chips and next-generation Blackwell chips to outpace supply well until 2025. This headwind can affect the company's growth prospects in the coming years.

Nvidia also accelerated the pace of release cadence (for major products or features) from once every two years to once annually. Continuously innovating and adapting hardware and software is the need of the hour in the face of increasing complexity and rapid evolution of AI models and workloads.

However, this also exposes Nvidia to significant execution risks and to the risk of clients delaying purchases to get access to the most advanced technologies. Nvidia's rapid pace of innovation can result in early product obsolescence for its older offerings and increasing risk of self-cannibalization.

Valuation estimates

Nvidia has consistently posting impressive financial metrics for the past several quarters. In the first quarter of fiscal 2025 (ending April 28), revenues were up by nearly 262% year over year to $26 billion, while net income soared by 628% year over year to $14.9 billion.

Analysts expect Nvidia's fiscal 2025 sales to grow by 97% year over year to $120 billion. While the revenue growth rate is expected to moderate in the next decade, analysts expect the company's sales to more than triple to $380.9 billion by 2034.

Nvidia is currently trading at a price-to-sales (P/S) multiple of 38.6x. Assuming that this multiple reverts to its 10-year average of 22.27x (a conservative estimate), we can expect Nvidia's market capitalization to reach around $8.5 trillion by 2034. While the market cap seems huge, it is only 2.7 times the company's current $3.1 trillion market capitalization. This implies that the stock can reach north of $340 by 2034 (assuming no significant share repurchases or stock splits).

Assuming Nvidia's P/S multiple remains at the current 38.6x level (a very aggressive estimate), the company's market capitalization will be around $14.7 trillion -- 4.7 times its current market capitalization. Still, the company's share price can be expected to reach close to $600 by the end of 2034.

Hence, based on current estimates, the chances of Nvidia's share price crossing $1,000 in the next decade appear slim. These projections, however, can change in case Nvidia makes even more dramatic advances in AI technologies in the coming years.

Yahoo Finance,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/buy-2-energy-stocks-analyst-124800239.html,2024-07-01,12:48:00 UTC,"Buy These 2 Energy Stocks, Analyst Says, Forecasting up to ~46% Upside","The price of oil has been volatile in the past 12 months. WTI, the US benchmark price, peaked above $90 at the end of September and fell just below $70 in December. Currently, it’s at $82 per barrel, a high price that is a boon to an industry that is also generating record-level production. The IEA is predicting that, by 2030, crude oil production in the US will increase by 2.1 million barrels per day over last year’s baseline.

Additionally, the high-demand environment for energy, especially as the summer driving season intensifies, creates a favorable scenario for investing in energy stocks. Share prices have declined alongside the dip in crude oil prices, presenting investors with an opportunity to buy into a sector with attractive valuations and solid near-term prospects.

This has Stephens analyst Michael Scialla recommending energy stocks. He’s forecasting solid upside potential, up to ~46% in one case, for two names in particular. We’ve used the TipRanks platform to look up the broader take on Scialla’s picks. Here they are, along with the analyst’s comments.

SM Energy Company (SM)

The first stock on our list is SM Energy, an independent exploration and production firm in the oil and gas sector. This firm, based in Denver, Colorado, traces its roots back more than a century and focuses on the acquisition and development of high-quality energy assets across the ‘lower 48.’ Currently, SM’s main operational assets are in Texas, where the company holds a net-acre position of ~111,000 in the famous Midland Basin in the western part of the state and another ~155,000 net acres in the Eagle Ford and Austin Chalk formations to the south. SM’s assets include crude oil, natural gas, and natural gas liquids.

Compared to its peers, SM’s holdings are not the largest – but the company has focused on acquiring top-tier assets, with the aim of maximizing value through applying the latest in hydrocarbon extraction technologies. The company had 1,323 net producing wells at the end of 2023, generating 152 Mboe/d in average net production. SM’s proven reserves, as of the end of last year, came to approximately 605 MMBoe. These reserves broke down to 38% crude oil, 42% natural gas, and 20% natural gas liquids.

In its last quarterly results, reported for 1Q24, SM reported a total top line of $559.9 million. This was down 2.4% year-over-year, but it beat the forecast by just over $3.2 million. At the bottom line, the company’s non-GAAP earnings came to $1.41 per share. Not only did this beat expectations by 13 cents per share, it was up from the $1.33 reported in the prior-year quarter.

Story continues

SM’s success in developing high-end production numbers from its assets was the trigger that caught analyst Scialla’s eye. The Stephens energy expert writes of this company, “An early mover in identifying and developing core assets in areas that industry previously deemed non-core, SM offers investors differentiated option value as it pushes the boundaries of resource plays in the Midland Basin and South Texas. SM’s Rockstar acreage in Howard County, which was believed to be located east of the Midland Basin core when the company acquired it in 2016 and 2017, has yielded some of the most prolific oil producers in the play over the past 5 years.”

The analyst goes on to outline this company’s potential for solid returns going forward, saying of it, “With ~40% of the production mix in the form of natural gas and more than 85% of next year’s projected output unhedged, SM has meaningful exposure to a potential rebound in 2025 natural gas prices. In addition, an under-leveraged balance sheet positions the company to ramp returns to investors, in our view.”

For Scialla, this stance backs up an Overweight (Buy) rating on SM, complemented by a $63 price target suggesting a 46% one-year upside potential. (To watch Scialla’s track record, click here)

Overall, SM Energy gets a Moderate Buy consensus rating from the Street, based on 12 recent analyst reviews that include 7 Buys and 5 Holds. The shares are priced at $43.23 and their $58.58 average target price implies a gain of 35.5% in the next 12 months. (See SM stock forecast)

Matador Resources Company (MTDR)

The second company we’ll look at, Matador Resources, is another player in the oil and gas exploration and production sector. Matador acquires energy assets in the US, with a particular focus on oil and natural gas shale formations – the same formations that brought us the fracking revolution earlier this century – along with other unconventional energy plays. Currently, Matador has active operations in three main areas: the Wolfcamp and Bone Spring plays of the Delaware Basin straddling the New Mexico/West Texas border; the Eagle Ford shale of South Texas; and the Haynesville shale and Cotton Valley energy plays in the northwest of Louisiana.

As a business strategy, Matador has focused on unconventional energy plays, using high-efficiency methods to maximize the extraction of hydrocarbon resources from these assets. In addition to operational efficiencies, Matador follows disciplined financial practices to maintain a strong balance sheet to ensure that both equity and debt capital serve the larger purpose of cost-efficient operations.

Matador’s operational execution exceeded the high end of guidance in the company’s 1Q24 report. Total production was reported as 149,760 Boe per day, compared to the top-end guidance number of 146,500 Boe/d. Of this, 84,777 barrels per day was oil production, and 389.9 MMcf per day was natural gas. The guidance numbers for oil and gas were 84,000 and 375 at the top ends.

Beating the forecast on production led to beating the forecast on revenues and earnings. Matador’s top line came to $787.7 million, more than $46 million over the estimates – and more than 40% better than the year-ago figure. Matador reported a non-GAAP earnings-per-share of $1.71, up from $1.50 in 1Q23 and 18 cents per share over expectations.

Scialla, in his coverage of Matador, is appreciative of the company’s strategy, particularly how it targets robust production from a low cost of operations. He says, “A pioneer in the Northern Delaware Basin, MTDR offers investors differentiated organic growth from a robust, low-cost drilling inventory. We forecast 2024 organic production growth of 19% y/y versus our midcap peer average of 3%. The company’s ‘brick-by-brick’ approach to building its land position is a core tenet of its value proposition and contributes to its strong margins. MTDR’s 2024 CF/Boe and FCF/Boe estimates are among the best in our mid-cap peer group.”

Based on this stance, Scialla rates MTDR as Overweight (i.e. Buy). He sets a price target of $83, showing his confidence in a 39% upside for the year ahead.

Matador’s dozen recent analyst ratings include 11 to Buy and 1 to Hold, for a Strong Buy consensus rating. The shares are priced at $59.60 and their $80.33 average price target implies that the stock has a one-year gain of 35% in store. (See MTDR stock forecast)

PARIS (Reuters) -Opponents of France's far right sought to build a united front to block the path to government of Marine Le Pen's National Rally (RN) on Monday, after the party made historic gains to win the first round of a parliamentary election.

The RN and its allies won Sunday's round with 33% of the vote, followed by a left-wing bloc with 28% and well ahead of President Emmanuel Macron's broad alliance of centrists, who scored just 22%, official results showed.

While financial markets rallied on relief the RN tally was not greater, it was still a huge setback for Macron, who had called the snap election after his ticket was trounced by the RN in the European Parliament election last month.

""I'm satisfied, because we need change,"" said RN supporter Jean-Claude Gaillet, 64, in Le Pen's northern stronghold of Henin-Beaumont. ""Things have not moved, and they must move.""

But others feared the rise of the RN and its nationalist platform would cause growing tensions in French society.

""I don't think people realise what's happening, they are only thinking of the cost of living and short-term things like that,"" said Yamina Addou outside a supermarket in the nearby town of Oignies, south of Lille. ""I find it very sad.""

Whether the anti-immigrant, eurosceptic RN can form a government will depend now on how successfully other parties manage to thwart Le Pen by rallying round best-placed rival candidates in hundreds of constituencies across France.

The RN would need at least 289 seats in parliament for a majority. Pollsters calculated the first round had put it on track for anything between 250-300 seats - but that is before tactical withdrawals reshape voter intentions next weekend.

'ATTACK!'

Leaders of both the left-wing New Popular Front and Macron's centrist alliance indicated on Sunday night they would withdraw their own candidates in districts where another candidate was better placed to beat the RN in next Sunday's run-off.

It was not initially clear whether such a pact would always apply if the left-wing candidate was from the far-left France Unbowed (LFI) party of Jean-Luc Melenchon, a divisive figure with radical tax-and-spend proposals and class war rhetoric.

But Macron told ministers on Monday that denying the RN a majority was the top priority, according to one source at a closed-door meeting who said this was intended to confirm that the pact could apply to LFI candidates on a case-by-case basis.

The source said Macron ended his speech at the Elysee Palace meeting with the call: ""Attack!""

Pollster Ipsos calculated the first round had left three-way contests in around 300 of the 577 seats in France's National Assembly. Le Monde newspaper said third-placed candidates had already withdrawn in around 160 of those.

While the so-called ""republican front"" against the far-right has broadly worked in the past, analysts question whether French voters are still ready to cast second-round ballots as directed by political leaders.

A longtime pariah for many in France, the RN is now closer to power than it has ever been. Le Pen has sought to clean up the image of a party known for racism and antisemitism, a tactic that has worked amid voter anger at Macron, who is seen by many voters as out of touch with their everyday concerns.

The RN gains were welcomed by nationalists and far-right groups across Europe, including Italy's Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni and Spain's Vox party. Pedro Sanchez, Spain's Socialist premier, said left-leaning parties could still block an outright RN victory.

German Foreign Minister Annalena Baerbock signalled concern at the rise of ""a party that sees Europe as the problem and not the solution"" and drew parallels to the growing support for the far-right Alternative for Germany (AfD) in her country.

An RN-led government would raise major questions over where the European Union was headed. Human rights groups have raised concerns about how its ""France first"" policies would apply to ethnic minorities, while economists question whether its hefty spending plans are fully funded.

HUNG PARLIAMENT?

Banking shares led a surge by French stocks and the premium investors demand for holding the country's bonds dropped, while the euro rose, on Monday on market relief the RN had not done better.

The main alternative scenario to an RN-led government would be a hung parliament potentially making France ungovernable for the remainder of Macron's presidency due to run until 2027.

In constituencies with no outright winner, the top two candidates, plus any candidate with more than 12.5% of registered voters in that constituency, have until Tuesday evening to confirm whether they will go into the second.

In the manoeuvring after the vote, Prime Minister Gabriel Attal suspended unemployment reform plans which would have reduced jobseekers' benefits - a move that may make it easier for left-wing voters to back Macron allies.

RN lawmakers meanwhile urged centre-right politicians in the Republicans (LR) party, which received less than 7% of the first-round vote, to withdraw from districts where such a move would work in RN's favour.

The LR, which split ahead of the vote with a small number of its lawmakers joining the RN, has yet to clarify its stance.

Jordan Bardella, the RN's choice of prime minister if it wins a majority, focused his attacks on left-wing parties, describing the far-left as ""an existential threat"" to France.","""I'm satisfied, because we need change,"" said RN supporter Jean-Claude Gaillet, 64, in Le Pen's northern stronghold of Henin-Beaumont.

At 0641 GMT, the rand traded at 18.44 against the dollar, almost 0.5% weaker than its previous close. The dollar was up around 0.09% against a basket of global currencies.

The Grid Technologies division has earmarked the 1.2 billion euros for new factories and higher manufacturing capacity in the United States, Europe and Asia, according to the Financial Times, which had reported on the recruitment plans earlier in the day.

About 40% of the new jobs will be added in Europe, while the U.S. and India will each receive 20% and the rest will go elsewhere in Asia and Latin America, according to the FT report.

BERLIN (Reuters) - For months, Philip Matthias tried to convince his father to install solar panels on their company's roof in the eastern German state of Thuringia, aiming to cut electricity costs and carbon emissions at the metal products factory.

Initially sceptical of the 2.3-million-euro ($2.5 million) investment, a substantial sum for the medium-sized Tridelta, his father crunched the numbers and decided to nearly double the project capacity, opting to install photovoltaic modules that could power around 900 households in addition to the factory.

""The PV systems amortize after about 7-1/2 years. The manufacturer gives a guarantee of 20 years. That means this is an extremely lucrative investment,"" Matthias told Reuters.

Since the war in Ukraine and the sudden drop in Russia fossil fuel exports to Germany, Berlin has introduced laws to accelerate solar power expansion, part of its plan to cover 80% of the country's energy from renewables by 2030.

Encouraged by a feed-in tariff providing a guaranteed price to renewable energy producers selling their power, as well as reduced solar panel costs, German companies are increasingly turning to solar to get around high energy costs.

Although Germany has Europe's biggest capacity of solar and wind power generation, its small and medium-sized companies have yet to benefit from lower electricity prices because of high grid fees and taxes they must pay. By generating their own solar power, they avoid those fees and taxes.

Companies consumed around 69% of Germany's national electricity in 2023, data by the BDEW utilities association showed.

""As electricity prices in Germany show no signs of decreasing as previously anticipated, companies are increasingly recognising the economic viability of installing solar panels,"" said Marie-Theres Husken, an energy expert for the BVMW association for small- and medium-sized businesses.

CORPORATE SOLAR SHIFT

Newly installed photovoltaic capacity on business rooftops rose by 81% year-on-year in the first four months of the year, outpacing the 1% growth in the residential sector, data by the BSW solar power association shows.

A May survey by pollster YouGov showed more than half of German companies with suitable roofs planned to install solar power systems in the next three years. BVMW forecasts that nearly all manufacturing companies in Germany will use solar energy by 2030.

In response to increasing demand, Germany's largest residential solar power developer, Enpal, said in April it was expanding into the commercial sector.

""The demand was not as instant... but the growth is going to be very sustainable,"" Melchior Schulze Brock, CEO of commercial and industrial solar startup Enviria.

An April study by the Freiburg-based Institute for Applied Ecology showed there was potential to install up to 287 gigawatts (GW) of solar capacity, more than enough to meet Berlin's 2030 target of 215 GW, along German roads, railways, parking lots, and industrial areas. This could significantly reduce reliance on agricultural land where permitting and planning approvals can take up to a decade.

A drop in solar panel prices globally since last year has spurred companies to embrace solar energy.

""The market is overrun with cheap but good panels from China. That means that the system that we are building now is about 20% cheaper than a year ago,"" Matthias said.

A German legislative package passed in April easing regulation and increasing subsidies for large rooftop systems as well as a pending tax investment reform for real estate funds operating rooftop solar panels, is expected to drive demand further.

State feed-in subsidies for large scale rooftop photovoltaic projects, introduced in 2021 and which are selected via tender, have also boosted the trend.

The last tender for the subsidised projects in February saw a 107% rise in the number of offers year-on-year, data by the federal grid network agency showed.

A feed-in tariff of 9.3 euros cents per kilowatt-hour, higher than Tridelta's power purchasing price, makes it currently cheaper for the company to sell future generated electricity to the grid and buy it back, Matthias said.

Germany's economy ministry declined to comment on companies' electricity trading strategies.

""There's a high correlation between the feed-in tariffs and the build-up of solar PV roof top projects,"" Hugo Willink, Executive Director at solar roofs developer Sunrock told Reuters.

Sunrock, which won an order from Mercedes Benz (ETR: ) in May to build a 23-megawatt solar project on the carmaker's factory roofs, sees Germany as its core market for the coming year.

NEW DELHI (Reuters) -Oil prices were little changed on Tuesday, holding near the two-month highs reached in the previous session, on expectations for rising fuel demand from the summer travel season and possible U.S. interest rate cuts that could boost economic growth.

futures rose 28 cents to $86.88 per barrel as of 0634 GMT after gaining 1.9% in the previous session to the highest close since April 30.

U.S. West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude rose 20 cents to $83.58 a barrel, after gaining 2.3% to its highest since April 26.

The oil price movement ""appears to be more fear and sentiment driven than fundamentals,"" said Vandana Hari, founder of oil market analysis provider Vanda (NASDAQ: ) Insights, pointing to the outlook for summer fuel demand, the higher chance of conflict between Israel and Iran and Hurricane Beryl as supportive factors.

Gasoline demand in the U.S., the world's biggest oil consumer, is expected to ramp up as the summer travel season picks up with the Independence Day holiday this week. The American Automobile Association has forecast that travel during the holiday period will be 5.2% higher than in 2023, with car travel alone 4.8% higher than a year earlier.

""This could help gasoline demand recover after a subdued first half of 2024,"" ANZ analysts wrote in a note.

On the supply side, markets were planning for possible disruptions from Hurricane Beryl on U.S. oil refining and offshore production. However, forecasts currently show the storm likely moving into Mexico's Bay of Campeche and causing problems for oil production there.

Beryl struck the Caribbean as a category 4 storm on Monday with warnings from the U.S. National Hurricane Center of an ""extremely dangerous situation"" after it jumped from a category 1 storm within 10 hours.

Signs of subsiding inflation in the U.S. are renewing hope the Federal Reserve may cut interest rates, possibly in September.

A report on Monday showed U.S. manufacturing activity contracted for a third month, and prices manufacturers paid for some inputs dropped to the lowest level in six months.

Along with a Commerce Department report on Friday showing U.S. inflation data was unchanged in May, that could strengthen the case for lowering U.S. interest rates, a step that would boost economic activity and oil demand.

Still, signs of less-than-expected demand growth have limited gains in oil prices.

Some data shows that crude imports to Asia, the world's biggest oil consuming region, in the first half of 2024, were lower than last year. This was mainly because of lower imports into China, the world's biggest oil importer and the second-largest consumer.","Gasoline demand in the U.S., the world's biggest oil consumer, is expected to ramp up as the summer travel season picks up with the Independence Day holiday this week.

We are now fully able to capitalize on our solid assets to develop the sales of the Ikoniscope20 platform benefitting from a unique integrated vertical solution, now integrating also by the products of the recently-acquired Hospitex International, best-in-class in their category. Boosted by proprietary AI features, we continue our mission of helping our customers and patients in the earlier detection of cancer cells, in particular in the fast-growing CTC market. Strengthened by the partnership with Biocare Medical that provided us with an increased financial visibility in the coming years and potential additional recurring revenues, we now aim at expanding our commercial footprint both in the US and Europe.

2023 and H1 2024 key highlights

The 2023 fiscal year was extremely structuring for the Company that laid the foundations for the exciting developments that already took place in the first half of 2024.

From a commercial point of view, the commercialization of the Ikoniscope20max is ongoing, with a new configuration of the Ikoniscope20 platform that was specifically studied for high-volume laboratories. This instrument is of particular interest for the USA, the largest market for Ikonisys, where the Company has recorded an increase in the number of FISH tests performed.

Furthermore, to fully tackle the US market, Ikonisys signed an agreement with Biocare Medical, a US leader in immunohistochemistry (IHC) and FISH (Fluorescent in situ hybridization) tools and reagents with 4,000+ customers, in October 2023. This alliance focuses on expanding the global distribution of Ikoniscope20 platform, notably in the US. Thanks to this collaboration, together with the ongoing commercial developments, Ikonisys has expanded its visibility over the next two years and expects to reach annual revenues between €5 and €7 million by that time. Moreover, the Company secured recurring revenues in the form of royalties on reagents sold by Biocare to users of the Ikoniscope20 platform.

Continuing on the strategic moves implemented by the management, in November 2023, Ikonisys announced the acquisition of Hospitex International, an Italian company leader in the cytology field, thanks to their ability to prepare the best slides in the world. Ikonisys will integrate Hospitex's extensive expertise in slide preparation, completing its existing solutions in automated slide analysis. Together, the Companies will offer a premium efficient cancer diagnostic on a global scale, benefitting from an extended geographical reach and a common customer base.

On the R&D side, two major projects have been completed with the Ikoniscope20 platform and the high-volume system Ikoniscope20max, accordingly with the Company's innovation DNA. In order to be able to exploit the full capabilities of AI, Ikonisys started the development of another upgrade to all the platforms, with the integration of an ultra-high-resolution camera and more powerful hardware. This will be also benefitting from efforts put in the CTCs detection field, for early detection of cancer and monitoring of treatment.

2023 Full-Year Results vs. 2022 - Simplified consolidated income statement (audited)

Euros FY 2023 FY 2022 Net Sales 448,557 616,866 Other income 196,616 318,352 Cost of goods sold (192,730) (183,413) Operating expenses (2,646,172) (3,186,585) Operating income / (loss) (2,193,729) (2,434,784) Financial income / (loss) (73,918) (13,537) Taxes - - Net income / (loss) (2,267,646) (2,448,320) Cash and cash equivalents at end of year 9,402 93,985

Net sales for the period ending on December 31, 2023 decreased to €449k, compared to €617k for the period ending December 31, 2022, due to the sale cycle of a specialized instrument such as the Ikoniscope20max, launched in the course of the year.

The Company recorded a decrease of the operating expenses. In particular the company cut to more than half G&A expenses, while continuing investing in R&D and Selling expenses. As a reminder, since 2022 the Company started amortizing capitalized R&D expenses for the Ikoniscope20 project. From 2023 the company started amortizing also capitalized R&D for the Ikoniscope20max project. Total D&A in 2023 was equal to 1.26m, while new capitalized R&D expenses for new development projects were equal to €540k.

Taking into account the above elements, as of December 31, 2023 the operating result amounted to €-2.19m, with an increase of €240k versus 2022 and the net income amounted to €-2.3m as of December 31, 2023, with an increase by €180k in comparison to the previous year.

The consolidated cash position as of December 31, 2023 amounted to €9k, compared to €94k as of December 31, 2022. It must be reminded that, as announced on December 28, 2023, on January 2, 2024, the Company closed a capital increase for a total of €1m.

Strategy and outlook

As a continuation of the 2023 and first half of 2024 achievements, the Company intends to continue its journey to become a major player in global cancer diagnostics, paving new ways as it expands its horizon with strategic alliances and acquisitions.

More specifically, in the second half of 2024, complete the full integration of Hospitex, Ikonisys will continue to move in the direction of strategic partnerships, alliances or integrations, to become an even more important player in the cancer diagnostics, offering integrated vertical solutions to customers. The combined management of the two companies has gathered its sustained efforts during the first months of 2024 to materialize this game-changing value proposition and expects to see the results starting from the second half of the year. In line with this strategy, Ikonisys has just announced a strategic collaboration1 with Ulisse BioMed, a healthcare biotech company, aim at offering comprehensive and precise diagnostics in cancer and thus, enhance patient outcomes.

Regarding its financial resources, in order to strengthen its financial structure and ensure the continuation of its day-to-day operations, Ikonisys recently closed a capital increase through private placement of €150k on June 3, 2024. Thanks to the Capital Increase and the previously secured financing facilities, the Company is now in a position to meet its financing needs for more than 12 months.

The submission is based on the results of the DISSOLVE I and II pivotal studies. SEL-212 is an innovative biologic therapy in development for the treatment of chronic refractory gout, a debilitating condition characterised by the persistent and painful buildup of urate crystals in the joints.

This significant milestone follows the FDA's Fast Track designation of SEL-212 in March 2024 , underscoring the urgent need for new treatment options for patients with chronic refractory gout. The FDA's Fast Track program is intended to facilitate the development and expedite the review of medicines that treat serious conditions and fill an unmet medical need.

""We are very pleased to initiate the rolling submission of the BLA for SEL-212, bringing Sobi one step closer to providing a potential new, effective treatment option for patients with chronic refractory gout,"" said Lydia Abad-Franch , MD, MBA, Head of Research, Development, and Medical Affairs, and Chief Medical Officer at Sobi. ""The Fast Track designation confirms the previously released SEL-212 phase 3 clinical data, highlighting the significant need for innovative therapies in this space and reinforcing our commitment to transforming the lives of patients with rare diseases.""

SEL-212 is a novel investigational combination medicine designed to reduce serum urate (SU) levels in people with chronic refractory gout, potentially reducing harmful tissue urate deposits which can lead to gout flares and joint deformity when left untreated. Sobi licensed SEL-212 from Selecta Biosciences (NASDAQ: ) (now Cartesian Therapeutics) in June 2020 and is responsible for development, regulatory and commercial activities in all markets outside of China .

About SEL-212

SEL-212 is a novel investigational combination medicine designed to reduce serum urate (SU) levels in people with chronic refractory gout, potentially reducing harmful tissue urate deposits which when left untreated can lead to debilitating gout flares and joint deformity. SEL-212 consists of pegadricase, Selecta's proprietary pegylated uricase, co-administered with ImmTOR™, designed to mitigate the formation of anti-drug antibodies (ADAs). ADAs develop due to unwanted immune responses to biologic medicines, reducing their efficacy and tolerability, which remains an issue across multiple therapeutic modalities and disease states including chronic refractory gout.

About Chronic refractory gout

Gout is the most common form of inflammatory arthritis with more than 8.3 million people in the United States having been diagnosed with gout, which is caused by high levels of uric acid in the body that accumulate around the joints and other tissues and can result in flares that cause intense pain. Approximately 200,000 people in the United States suffer from chronic gout refractory to conventional medicines, a painful and debilitating condition in people with SU levels above 6 mg/dL and therefore have several flares per year and can develop nodular masses of uric acid crystals known as tophi. Elevated SU levels have been associated with diseases of the heart, vascular system, metabolism, kidney and joints.

About Cartesian Therapeutics

Cartesian Therapeutics is a clinical-stage company pioneering mRNA cell therapies for the treatment of autoimmune diseases. The Company's lead asset, Descartes-08, is a potential first-in-class mRNA CAR-T in phase 2b clinical development for patients with generalised myasthenia gravis. Additional phase 2 studies are planned in systemic lupus erythematosus under an allowed IND, as well as basket trials in additional autoimmune indications. The Company's clinical-stage pipeline also includes Descartes-15, a next-generation, autologous anti-BCMA mRNA CAR-T.

About Sobi ®

TOKYO (Reuters) -The U.S. dollar hit a near 38-year high to the yen on Tuesday following a surge in Treasury yields as investors contemplated prospects of a second Donald Trump presidency.

Japan's weak currency helped lift the above the psychological 40,000 mark for the first time in three months, making the index an outlier as many other regional stock markets struggled.

rose, building on a strong rally in the previous session, as the northern hemisphere summer driving season got underway.

The dollar rose as high as 161.745 yen on Tuesday, a level not seen since December 1986.

The currency pair is highly sensitive to U.S. yields and the benchmark climbed nearly 14 basis points to 4.479% to start the week.

Analysts attributed the move to expectations for Trump winning the presidency, resulting in higher tariffs and government borrowing. The 10-year yield stood at 4.4415% in Tokyo hours.

President Joe Biden's faltering debate performance last week was the trigger behind the yield surge, but an additional catalyst came with the Supreme Court's ruling on Monday that Trump has broad immunity from prosecution over attempts to overturn his 2020 election loss, said Chris Weston, head of research at Pepperstone.

""Bond traders have an eye on Trump's increasing odds of taking the White House, and the market senses Trump 2.0 will be inflationary,"" Weston said.

The yen's malaise has traders on high alert for Japanese intervention after authorities spent some 9.8 trillion yen ($60.65 billion) in the days spanning late April and early May, when the currency plunged to 160.82 per dollar.

Japanese finance minister Shunichi Suzuki reiterated on Tuesday that officials are watching currency markets with vigilance, but noticeably didn't repeat a warning that they stood ready to act.

""Market participants continued to ignore his comments and appear to be testing the Ministry of Finance's resolve to support the JPY,"" said Carol Kong, a strategist at Commonwealth Bank of Australia (OTC: ).

""The path of least resistance is therefore further gains in .""

As a result, the Nikkei rallied more than 1%, putting it head and shoulders above other major markets in the region.

Hong Kong's added 0.4% amid gains for property stocks, but mainland blue chips were flat, and the tech-heavy Taiwan benchmark dropped 0.74%.

U.S. pointed 0.13% lower, following a 0.27% rise overnight for the cash index.

Pan-European futures were off 0.12%, after the advanced 0.3% on Monday.

The euro gave back some ground to the dollar on Tuesday following a relief rally, with the far-right National Rally (RN) not taking as many votes as some polls had predicted in France's weekend election.

Rival political parties have joined forces to try and prevent the RN from taking a majority in Sunday's second round, bowing out of constituencies where another candidate is better placed. The deadline to drop off the ballot is later on Tuesday.

The euro eased 0.12% to $1.0727, after pushing as high as $1.0776 on Monday for the first time since June 13.

Sterling lost 0.14% to $1.2633.

slumped to a fresh seven-month low, weighed by a broad shift in the central bank's daily guidance that analysts say indicates authorities are willing to allow the currency to ease further.

In offshore trading, the dollar edged as high as 7.3085 yuan, the highest since mid-November.

U.S. monetary policy will be in focus later in the day, when Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell speaks at an event in Sintra, Portugal hosted by the European Central Bank.

A parade of potentially crucial U.S. employment data begins on Tuesday with the JOLTS job openings report, a Fed favourite, followed by ADP numbers a day later and the all-important monthly payrolls figures on Friday.

In energy markets, futures added 0.25% to $86.82 per barrel, building on a 1.9% overnight rally. U.S. West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude rose 0.17% to $83.52, extending a jump of 2.3% from the previous session.

COLOMBO (Reuters) - Sri Lanka will save $5 billion in interest owed to bilateral creditors as part of its debt restructuring process, President Ranil Wickremesinghe said on Tuesday, adding that the funds will be used to boost dollar reserves and restore growth.

The cash-strapped South Asian country inked deals with China and other creditor nations to restructure about $10 billion in bilateral debt last week following 15 months of negotiations, Wickremesinghe told parliament.

The agreements brought Sri Lanka closer to the end of a debt restructuring process that began in September 2022 after its foreign exchange reserves hit their lowest levels and forced the island nation to default on its foreign debt for the first time.

""Sri Lanka gains multiple benefits from this agreement. The repayment period has been extended by eight years to 2043 and interest rates have been adjusted to 2.1% or less,"" Wickremesinghe said.

""The country stands among middle-income nations that have successfully navigated the debt restructuring process in such a brief time-frame.""

Talks with bondholders to restructure $12.5 billion worth of debt is progressing well and a conclusion is expected soon, Wickremesinghe said, kicking-off a two-day debate on the restructuring process in parliament.

Sri Lanka, whose total external debt is $37 billion, also has to finalise arrangements with China Development Bank to restructure debt of $2.2 billion, according to latest finance ministry data.

The debt rework, which is underpinned by a $2.9 billion International Monetary Fund (IMF) programme, gives Sri Lanka a chance to restore its debt sustainability and use saved funds to improve public services, increase reserves, and reduce domestic interest rates, he added.

Once the entire debt restructuring process is completed Sri Lanka hopes its debt burden will be reduced by $16.9 billion.

The central bank estimates Sri Lanka's economy will expand 3% in 2024 after contracting 2.3% last year.","By Uditha JayasingheCOLOMBO (Reuters) - Sri Lanka will save $5 billion in interest owed to bilateral creditors as part of its debt restructuring process, President Ranil Wickremesinghe said on Tuesday, adding that the funds will be used to boost dollar reserves and restore growth.

NEW DELHI (Reuters) - An Indian state government's inspection of a Som Group distillery said child labourers, some aged between 13 and 17, were made to fill and pack liquor bottles and worked long hours.

Police are investigating the use of child labour at the distillery in Madhya Pradesh state after the federal government's National Commission for Protection of Child Rights said last month it had found 58 children working illegally at the factory.

The commission released photos of some with hands showing chemical burns and said some children were transported in school buses for factory work.

A day after the children were found on June 15, an inspection report was drafted by the state's industrial health and safety department based on interviews with 27 workers, the youngest among them being 13 years old. The state says those aged under 21 cannot work in a liquor factory.

The report, which is not public but was seen by Reuters, says children were working 11-hour shifts starting at 8 a.m.

Som and the Madhya Pradesh government did not respond to Reuters' requests for comment.

In a submission to the state government on June 18, also seen by Reuters, Som said some children would visit the company to deliver food and medicines to their parents, and no worker was younger than 21.

Som is one of the smaller distilleries in India's thriving alcohol industry, where both foreign and domestic players operate. Its website describes it as an ""internationally acclaimed brand"" available in more than 20 markets including the United States, New Zealand and the United Kingdom.

The incident has drawn attention to child labour in Indian supply chains. In 2021, Reuters reported an external audit of two Carlsberg (CSE: ) warehouses found underage labourers at a location in the eastern state of Jharkhand. Carlsberg at the time said it had terminated the services of the third-party provider.

In the Som inspection report, the state government said the children working there were not given training on how they could protect themselves from harmful chemicals.

""Since it is hazardous work, there should have been a health centre at the factory,"" the report said.

The Madhya Pradesh government temporarily suspended the Som distillery's manufacturing licences, but the company has challenged the decision, saying there has been no conclusive finding of wrongdoing.

After Som's challenge, a local court put the state's decision on hold and said it would next hear the case later this month.

In a statement to the stock exchange last month, Som Distilleries and Breweries Ltd said the Madhya Pradesh plant was run by its ""associate private limited company"" and used labour supplied by contractors who may not have carried out proper age checks. The listed company's shares have fallen by 8% since the children were found at the factory.","Police are investigating the use of child labour at the distillery in Madhya Pradesh state after the federal government's National Commission for Protection of Child Rights said last month it had found 58 children working illegally at the factory.

Will the opposition parties form a sufficiently convincing alliance to prevent the National Rally from gaining an outright majority, or will Marine Le Pen’s National Rally amass the majority despite all efforts?

Both scenarios mean some political uncertainty for France and beyond its borders, but investors’ hearts are pounding toward the first option: a hung government – which would at least prevent Le Pen from exploding the national debt and jeopardize/reverse Macron’s efforts to pull the national debt back to levels acceptable by EU rules.

The latter would help tame the spread between the French and the German bonds – which already retreated below 80pb on Monday on hope and pricing that Le Pen won’t secure a parliamentary majority, and support euro. The rallied to 1.0776 yesterday and flirted with its 50-DMA but retreated to around 1.0730 this morning. The opened the week with a bang, gaining as much as 2.7% before paring losses and closing just 1% up. The European futures are in the negative this morning.

On the data front, European Central Bank (ECB) Chief Lagarde warned that the bank doesn’t have enough evidence that the inflation threat is over, hinting that the ECB will probably bypass a second rate cut when it meets later this month. Inflation numbers revealed by major Eurozone countries since Friday are mixed: as expected in France, a bit higher than expected in Spain, and a bit lower than expected in Italy and Germany. So far, the actual CPI numbers didn’t deviate much from expectations – clearly not enough to deviate the attention from the French election jitters.

The aggregate inflation figure for early June is due today, both headline and core inflation are expected to have eased slightly in June. If that’s the case, we could see the ECB doves breathe a sigh of relief, if not, the euro could see a minor support but in both cases, the euro will remain under the pressure of French political uncertainties throughout the week, and any rally attempts could limited into the second election weekend in France.

In the US, data released yesterday posted softer-than-expected numbers in June and a decline in construction spending in May. Atlanta Fed’s GDP Now plunged to 1.7%. All that softness could’ve pulled the US yields lower but the political news – there - interfere with the market pricing as well.

According to the latest, the Supreme Court said that Donald Trump will benefit from some immunity from criminal charges for trying to reverse the 2020 election, making him a step closer to winning this year’s presidential election after last week’s worrying debate for Joe Biden. The Trump win expectation makes US curve steeping an active bet according to Morgan Stanley analysts who say that Trump in the White House will slow growth and boost inflation – with increased trade tensions and more tariffs.

In the FX, the fell yesterday on a knee-jerk jump in the euro but is upbeat this morning. The continues its hike above the 161.50 level, preparing to test the 162 with limited upside potential given the direct FX intervention threat. The franc is giving back the safe haven gains of late. The is back above the 100-DMA while the takes over the 50-DMA offers. The Swiss National Bank’s (SNB) dovish stance should keep the franc on a softening path, apart from periods of sudden appreciation due to safe-haven flows.

In equities, the consolidated gains near record on Monday, s Tesla (NASDAQ: ) jumped more than 6% to above its 200-DMA ahead of the quarterly deliveries report that’s due today, and that could confirm a second-quarter decline in deliveries. The Chinese rival BYD (SZ: ) on the other hand is down in Hong Kong after announcing to have sold 1 million cars in Q2 – around 426K of them being purely electric.

In energy, started the week strong ahead of the July 4th holiday in the US, which AAA predicts will see a record number of drivers, and Hurricane Beryl, which is not expected to impact operations in the Gulf of Mexico immediately but could cause disruptions later in the week. US crude rallied 2.4% and hit the $84pb mark for the first time since April. Risks remain tilted to the upside, the next target for the bulls stands at $85pb level, where we should see support and rebound given that the soft manufacturing data from the US and China at the start of the week don’t give a further support.

The price pullbacks in the FTSE 100 are likely interesting opportunities to strengthen long positions in energy-heavy British stocks that should fully benefit from reflation trades once the election is behind. Zooming out, the FTSE 100 didn’t do bad at all over the past few quarters. The index posted a fourth-quarter gain in the Q2, has hit a record high in May and remains upbeat as we enter the second half on expectation of more political stability, an upcoming Bank of England (BoE) rate cut and improved reflation flows.","The rallied to 1.0776 yesterday and flirted with its 50-DMA but retreated to around 1.0730 this morning.

Naomi Klein described the concept and cited examples in her 2008 book The Shock Doctrine: The Rise of Disaster Capitalism, and summarized the core dynamic: ""Disaster capitalism perpetuates cycles of poverty and exploitation.""



Move over, Disaster Capitalism--make room for Addiction Capitalism.



Addiction Capitalism is my term for the last-ditch / desperation method of guaranteeing sales and profits when everybody already has everything: reduce the quality so everything fails and must be replaced, and addict your customers to your product or service which--what a surprise--only you or your cartel provide.



And since you've bought up all the competition and moated your monopoly via regulatory thickets / regulatory capture, consumers must continue paying--or suffer the consequences. Addiction Capitalism is capital's last best hope when the essentials of life and novelties are both over-supplied. So the only ways to juice demand and maintain profits are 1) lower the quality of goods so they must be constantly replaced (Cory Doctorow's ""ensh**tification"") and 2) addict consumers to services such as social media and products such as smartphones, or create dependencies which are equivalent to addiction, such as dependency on weight-loss medications.



Just as the addict is dependent on a drug, patients are dependent on medications that must be taken until the end of their lives.



Jonathan Haidt's new book offers a scathing indictment of the intentionally addictive--and destructive--nature of social media and smartphones The Anxious Generation: How the Great Rewiring of Childhood Is Causing an Epidemic of Mental Illness.



For another example of how Addiction Capitalism works, consider how tech companies sell a basic accounting software system for a small sum until it becomes a standard for households and small businesses. Then they eliminate outright purchase of the software and switch to a high-cost subscription model. Nice little history of all your financial records you got there; it would be a shame to lose all that by refusing to pay our monthly fee.



Put another way: going cold turkey and refusing to pay the subscription / prescription is going to be painful. That monkey on your back comes in many forms: checking your phone 300 times a day, obsessively counting ""likes,"" binging on streaming TV and snacks, junk food, fast food, and other addictive glop--the list is long indeed.



Addiction Capitalism is neatly summarized in this scene from Bruce Lee's 1973 martial arts film Enter the Dragon, where the villain Han reveals his opium empire to martial artist Roper, played by John Saxon:



Han: ""We are investing in corruption, Mr Roper. The business of corruption is like any other.""



Roper: ""Oh yeah! Provide your customers with products they need and, uh, charge a little bit to stimulate your market and before you know it customers come to depend on you, I mean really need you. It's the law of economics.""



That's Addiction Capitalism in a nutshell: ""customers come to depend on you, I mean really need you."" That presents us with a choice: ""and you want me to join this?""","Naomi Klein described the concept and cited examples in her 2008 book The Shock Doctrine: The Rise of Disaster Capitalism, and summarized the core dynamic: ""Disaster capitalism perpetuates cycles of poverty and exploitation.""

Key euro area data today as the annual ECB forum starts

Dollar on the back foot amidst a very busy week

Yen remains under pressure

Euro Gains Despite Strong Result From the National Rally Party

France’s National Rally party confirmed expectations by winning the highest level of support in the first round of the country’s parliamentary elections, ahead of the left-wing New Popular Front coalition and miles ahead of Macron’s centrist alliance. National Rally's leader Marie Le Pen has literally won round one of the fight, but nothing has been decided yet as the countdown to the second round, and final one, of elections has already started.

Le Pen is clearly aiming to achieve a majority by winning 289 seats in the next parliament and make President Macron’s life difficult until 2027, when the next presidential elections are scheduled for. However, the left-wing coalition and Macron’s alliance are now weighing whether to support each other's candidates in Sunday’s second round, which could prove successful and potentially stop Le Pen's party from achieving the crucial majority.

European stock markets have opened in the green today and the has gapped higher again against the as the French opposition parties’ seemingly unified front against Le Pen has been seen as a positive step. However, should this effort fail and Le Pen et al manage to achieve a parliamentary majority, there is scope for significant underperformance of the euro across the board.

German Inflation Next; Focus Also on ECB Forums

Amidst these developments in France, the market will have to digest a rather busy schedule, especially in the euro area. The preliminary inflation report from Germany will be published later today with the eurozone aggregate figures coming on Tuesday. There is a small possibility of an upside surprise today, but these inflation prints are unlikely to change the outcome of the July meeting since the ECB hawks remain very uncomfortable about the June rate cut. As President Lagarde mentioned at the last ECB gathering, the ECB needs to see a plethora of data confirming the disinflation process in order to cut rates again.

Interestingly, the annual ECB forum on Central Banking starts today in Sintra, Portugal with Lagarde holding the introductory speech later today. There will be a barrage of speeches from central bankers over the next three days, including comments from various Fed officials with Chairman Powell participating in a panel discussion tomorrow.

Key US Data Week as Biden’s Future in Tatters

The holiday-shortened week across the pond starts on a high note with the release of the June ISM manufacturing survey with the crucial non-farm payroll report coming on Friday. The key point of discussion though in the US is still the recent presidential debate and more specifically President Biden’s performance. Speculation is rife that he could eventually be forced to step down with vice-president Kamala Harris being the frontrunner to replace him.

Yen Remains Under Pressure

Despite the ongoing dollar weakness and a barrage of comments from Japanese government officials, the pair remains above the 160-yen level. It is evident that the market is testing the BoJ, but the mixed data is not giving the green light to Governor Ueda et al to respond appropriately using monetary policy. Market intervention remains the other option for the BoJ, with arguable results at best.","Le Pen is clearly aiming to achieve a majority by winning 289 seats in the next parliament and make President Macron’s life difficult until 2027, when the next presidential elections are scheduled for.

The (XAU) price had decreased by 0.04% by the end of the previous week. On Friday, XAU/USD remained stable throughout the day and moved within the 2,320–2,340 range.

The price of gold remained stable after US data showed a decline in inflation, increasing investors' hopes for an interest rate cut this year. Friday's Personal Consumption Expenditures (PCE) Price Index showed that year-on-year inflation has slowed from 2.7% in April towards 2.6% in May. The latest US inflation data had little effect on market expectations regarding the beginning of the monetary policy easing as it aligned with analysts' expectations. Traders are pricing in a 63% chance of a first rate reduction in September, according to the CME FedWatch Tool. This week, the market is waiting for a speech by Fed Chairman Jerome Powell on Tuesday, followed by the latest Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) meeting minutes on Wednesday and data on the US labour market on Friday. The report will help get more information about the US interest rate path.

Last week, demand for gold in India declined amid rising prices, as many people postponed buying in the hope that the government would reduce import duties.

""Key metals consumer China's manufacturing activity grew at the fastest pace in more than three years, a private sector survey showed. It contrasts with an official PMI released on Sunday that showed a decline in manufacturing activity"", Reuters reports on the situation in another large gold-importing country. ""Although central bank purchases have slowed down in recent months, we believe emerging market's central banks will continue to diversify their reserves into gold"", ANZ said in a quarterly note.

Spot gold was nearly unchanged at $2,324.44 per ounce in the early hours of the European trading session. The market is likely to be calm today, with low volatility. Traders are waiting for Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell's speech tomorrow and the following reports. The price support level is located at 2,300, and the resistance level is at 2,340.

The Euro Rises as the French Election Uncertainty Ease

The euro (EUR) was essentially unchanged on Friday as traders refrained from opening large orders ahead of the first round of French parliamentary elections.

has been in a downtrend for most of June as the outlook for the eurozone economy was clouded by political uncertainty. Moreover, a more cautious approach to future rate cuts by the US Federal Reserve (Fed) also contributed to the euro's weakness. EUR/USD was declining as investors continued to expect the European Central Bank (ECB) to be more dovish than the Fed this year. However, this outlook has started to shift lately. The latest interest rates swap market data implies 45 basis points (bps) worth of rate cuts by the Fed by the end of 2024 and 43 bps rate reductions by the ECB over the same period. Thus, EUR/USD has managed to stabilise in the 1.07000 area. However, the pair may lack a clear trend in the short term and will probably continue to move sideways.

EUR/USD jumped sharply during the Asian trading session and continued to rise in the early European session as the uncertainty surrounding French Parliamentary elections has subsided. Marine Le Pen's far-right National Rally (RN) party won the first round of elections on Sunday but by fewer votes than was initially projected.

""They (RN) have actually performed a little bit worse than what was expected. As a result of that, we saw the euro rise modestly in early Asian trade just because we might actually get less fears of more expansionary and unsustainable fiscal policy if the far-right party did a little bit worse"", said Carol Kong, currency strategist at Commonwealth Bank of Australia (CBA).

Still, EUR/USD hasn't yet broken the downtrend, and the pair has been down by 1% since President Emmanuel Macron called the election on 9 June.

Today, traders should focus on German Consumer Price Index (CPI) reports, which will be released throughout the day, and the US ISM Manufacturing Purchasing Managers Index (PMI) data due at 2:00 p.m. UTC. If German inflation surprises on the upside or US PMI numbers are lower than expected, EUR/USD will almost certainly rise, possibly touching 1.08000. Otherwise, the pair may pull back towards 1.07000 again.

Japan's Growth Problems Deepen, Fueling Yen Weakness

The (JPY) continued to weaken on Friday. USD/JPY set a new multi-decade high as the US Personal Consumption Expenditure (PCE) Price Index figures mostly aligned with market expectations.

US monthly inflation was unchanged in May, while consumer spending rose only marginally, meaning that the Federal Reserve (Fed) may still opt for a 25-basis-point rate cut in September. Investors continue to price in a 63% chance that the Fed's policy easing would start in September, compared to about 64% before the data was released. The (USD) initially dipped against the Japanese yen, a currency highly sensitive to US economic data due to its close link with US Treasury yields. However, the greenback recovered and ended flat on the day, as the larger interest rate gap between the US and Japan remained the key driver for investors.

USD/JPY was rising during the Asian and early European trading sessions. A surprising government update revealed that Japan's Gross Domestic Product (GDP) growth rate in Q1 contracted more sharply than previously estimated. The downward revision might prompt the Bank of Japan (BOJ) to revise its growth forecasts downward in its upcoming projections, potentially impacting the timing of its next interest rate hike. As a result, USD/JPY briefly rose above the 161.00 level.

Today, traders should focus on the US ISM Manufacturing Purchasing Managers' Index (PMI), due at 2:00 p.m. UTC. If the numbers are higher than expected, USD/JPY may continue to rise even though the bullish trend is already quite mature and has been showing technical signs of exhaustion lately. Conversely, weaker-than-expected PMI numbers may prompt a downward correction in USD/JPY, possibly below the 160.00 mark.","Gold Remains Stable Despite Easing US InflationThe (XAU) price had decreased by 0.04% by the end of the previous week.

The New Popular Front – the alliance of left and greens - won 28% of the votes and Emmanuel Macron’s party posted a miserable 20%. The second round is due next weekend.

The kneejerk reaction was a jump in the euro in the early week trading. The jumped past 1.0750, the euro-pound flirted with the 0.85 level and the European futures trade in the positive as a ‘buy the rumour sell the fact’ reaction to the election outcome - and also on chatter that National Rally may not secure an absolute majority in the second round. But there is a non-neglectable chance for Marine Le Pen and Mr, Bardella to win the parliamentary majority next week and that risk will unlikely let the euro run too high before more clarity.

The spread between the French and German 10-year yields topped 80bp last week, a level that has not been seen since the European debt crisis back more than a decade ago. But the French-German spread has room to widen and a Le Pen majority could revive that demon.

Across the Channel, the week starts with increased election vibes as well, because Brits will be headed to their own general election this Thursday with little suspense on the horizon. A Labour win is seen as a net positive for financial markets, and would benefit to banks, homebuilders and groceries the most according to JP Morgan. A Labour should also benefit to the British pound in the long run on hope of improved relations with Europe post- Brexit. In the short run, however, a Labour win is broadly priced in. Therefore the return of the Bank of England (BoE) doves following the election could keep the pound’s upside potential limited. Cable trades around its 50-DMA this morning and may not clear the 1.28 offers even after the election dust settles.

Good news from the data front!

Released on Friday, the US core PCE slowed as expected in May as personal spending fell short of expectations. Combined to Thursday’s soft GDP number, last week’s US data was supportive of the Federal Reserve (Fed) doves. The hit a fresh record, though closed the session in the negative.

But looking back, the S&P 500 and had a stellar H1 thanks to the extension of the tech rally. It would be healthy to see the rally broaden to other sectors provided that the narrow breadth increases the risk of sudden and sharp selloffs. According to Bank of America, the algorithmic models boosted their exposure to technology to such extent that the stop-loss triggers became very tight.

In numbers, the commodity trader advisors, so the automated trade models, can start unwinding their long positions when the US futures drop 2.8% or more, while this threshold was at 4% a month ago. This means that the margin for a misstep becomes narrower and the risk of long squeeze rises as the major US indices travel through uncharted territories on the shoulders of just a few tech names that are probably overpriced.","But the French-German spread has room to widen and a Le Pen majority could revive that demon.

Despite the Fed’s “significant progress” in lowering inflation, most citizens are outraged and confused by economists’ relatively rosy inflation observations. Most citizens believe inflation is still rampant.

The Fed and economists are correct in that inflation is now tame. At the same time, citizens dissatisfied with high prices have solid grounds on which to base their disapproval.

Let’s better understand how such contradictory beliefs can both be factual. Furthermore, in the process, we can help Jerome Powell understand why economic sentiment is poor despite a near-record low unemployment rate.

You know, I don’t think anyone knows, has a definitive answer why people are not as happy about the economy as they might be. -Jerome Powell 6/12/2024

Visualizing Divergent Inflation Opinions

The graph below of the BLS CPI New Vehicles price index, a CPI component, demonstrates why economists and citizens have such grossly contrasting opinions of inflation.

Economists focus on the blue line, graphing the year-over-year change in new vehicle prices. Over the last year, the price index of new vehicles has decreased by .60%. Economists can say the cost of buying a new vehicle is in a deflationary state.

While the chart may warm the hearts of economists and the Fed, most individuals see the orange line, the CPI price index for new vehicles instead. It shows that new vehicle prices are up about 20% since the pandemic. Yes, they may have recently declined slightly, but today’s prices are nowhere close to where they were four years ago. In their minds, there is significant inflation in new vehicles.

Economists Prefer Growth Rates, Not Absolutes

Ask an economist what the nation’s is, and they will quote an annualized growth rate to a decimal point. We bet almost all of them will get the answer correct within one or two-tenths of one percent.

Ask them again, but request the answer in dollars. It would not be surprising if many economists are off by a trillion or even two trillion dollars, representing anywhere from 3.00% to 7.00% of the economy.

Economists prefer to analyze and quote many economic data points in terms of percentage change. For instance, how much did industrial production or retail sales change versus last month or over the previous quarter or year? They vastly prefer growth rates because it gives them a comparable and insightful way of analyzing economic data. Let’s review why this is the case.

Comparative Analysis

Economists are more adept at comparing data from different periods, industries, and countries if they have a common measurement calculation. Instead of absolute change, which doesn’t account for the starting point, a growth rate captures the absolute change and the starting point. Consider the following:

If GDP increases by $1 trillion this year, how would that compare to a $1 trillion increase in 2000? The question is challenging to answer using absolute numbers. However, growth rates allow us to evaluate the two periods quickly. Today, GDP is $28.284 trillion; therefore, a $1 trillion increase would represent 3.50% growth. In 2000, GDP was close to $10 trillion. Adding a trillion dollars of economic growth would have resulted in a 10% growth rate. While a trillion dollars is a trillion dollars in absolute terms, there is a stark difference between 10% and 3.50% growth.

Trend Analysis

Growth rates highlight trends and changes over time more clearly than absolute numbers. They can show whether an economy is accelerating, decelerating, or maintaining a steady pace.

Consider the graph below. The blue line, showing the make-believe production of widgets, starts at 1,000 widgets and increases by 100 widgets annually. The steady growth in absolute terms is a linear upward trending line. However, the annual growth rate steadily declines from 10% to 4% by year 20. An economist looking at the graph would say the rate of the production of widgets is declining despite the upward trend in the number of widgets being produced annually.

Policy Decision Making

The Fed aims to promote stable economic growth. To do so they balance the level of interest rates with inflation and economic activity. Having like figures to analyze, such as growth rates, makes their task significantly more straightforward. Imagine if the Fed had to determine the appropriate interest rate given that the economy grew by $750 billion last year and the CPI price index rose by 2.45.

Investors prefer growth rates for the same reason. If I can estimate the economy’s growth rate and other critical economic figures, they can better determine a growth rate or interest rate they would accept for taking risks.

The capital asset pricing model (CAPM) is a bedrock for finance. The formula states that an asset’s expected return should equal the risk-free interest rate plus the asset’s sensitivity (beta) times the market’s expected return. This formula can only work with growth rates, not absolute numbers.

Consumer’s Point Of View

Regarding inflation, consumers are less concerned with growth rates and heavily focused on absolute prices. They remember that bread used to cost $4 a loaf and now costs $7. The graph below shows the price of white bread was stable between $1.25 and $1.50 a pound from 2008 to the pandemic. It is now close to $2 a pound.

That is significant inflation. But it doesn’t tell the whole story. If wages also rose similarly, purchasing power hasn’t changed. It is similar to hearing stories from your parents or grandparents about going to the movies and getting popcorn and a soda, all for $1. Did you ever ask them how much money they made at the time?

Summary

We want to make it clear that we do not condone inflation. It accelerates an already wide wealth gap and creates hardships for many citizens. For more, please read our article, .

We analyze inflation data similarly to economists. We accept that absolute prices are much higher today than a few years ago, but we also acknowledge that, in general, wages are higher as well. Just like we can’t realistically compare a 15-cent ) hamburger to a $3.00 one today, we should be careful comparing prices today to their prices a few years ago.

Prices are not returning to 2020 levels. In fact, any hint that aggregate prices retreat from current levels will cause the Fed to panic and quickly stimulate inflation via lower interest rates and QE. We remind you that the Fed was lamenting that we didn’t have enough inflation throughout most of the period between the financial crisis and the pandemic.","Despite the Fed’s “significant progress” in lowering inflation, most citizens are outraged and confused by economists’ relatively rosy inflation observations.

Focus today turns to core PCE inflation

Yen slides, intervention risks rise

French citizens head to the ballots on Sunday

Trump Election Win Bets Support Dollar

The traded slightly lower against most of its major peers on Thursday, extending gains only against the and the . That said, the greenback is on the front foot again today, gaining the most ground versus the and the .

What helped the dollar move higher during the Asian session today may have been the debate between the 2024 presidential candidates Joe Biden and Donald Trump, with the latter seen as putting in a stronger showing than the incumbent President.

The likelihood of Trump returning to the Oval Office could mean lower corporate taxes, tougher trade relations, and consequently more advances on Wall Street and higher Treasury yields. The prospect of more tariffs on China may be the reason why the dollar is gaining the most against the aussie and the kiwi, as China is the main trading partner of both Australia and New Zealand.

PCE Inflation Expected to Cool

Today, dollar traders are likely to turn their attention to the core PCE price index for May, the Fed’s favorite inflation metric. Expectations are for a slowdown to 2.6% y/y from 2.8%, something supported by the slide in the core CPI rate for the month.

Currently, market participants are penciling in around a 70% chance of a first quarter-point reduction by the Fed in September. Thus, a slide in the core PCE rate may encourage them to take that percentage higher and thereby sell some dollars.

Yen Traders Stay on Intervention Watch

The yen continued to bleed, with the dollar/yen briefly breaking above 161 earlier today as traders continued to test the nerves of Japanese authorities, which have lately become vocal again about one-sided declines in their currency.

The acceleration in the Tokyo CPI figures for June passed unnoticed by yen traders, though the probability of another 10bps hike by the BoJ in July remained elevated at around 60%.

What’s even more interesting is that today, the Japanese government replaced the nation’s top currency diplomat Masato Kanda with financial regulation expert Atsushi Mimura. With Finance Minister Suzuki noting that authorities remain “deeply concerned” about the impact of steep yen declines, Kanda’s replacement may have increased the risk for a new intervention episode soon.

In light of this, yen traders may now be keener to cover some of their short positions to minimize potential losses in case of intervention, something that could result in a small setback in the dollar/yen.

French Election, Round One

In Europe, the spotlight is turning to the first round of the French elections. If no candidate gets an absolute majority, which is the most likely case, the top two candidates, and any other that receives more than 12.5% of the registered votes, move to a second round.

Opinion polls suggest that Le Pen’s far-right National Rally is likely to secure the most seats in Parliament, but not a majority. The far-left New Popular Front is seen second and Macron’s Ensemble coalition third.

This first round could shed light on how likely it is for Le Pen to form a coalition with smaller parties after the second round, or whether the nation will be left with a completely hung parliament. Given that no election can take place for another year under the French Constitution after this, a hung parliament may be the worst-case scenario for the as the Eurozone’s second-largest economy will enter a prolonged period of political stalemate.","PCE Inflation Expected to CoolToday, dollar traders are likely to turn their attention to the core PCE price index for May, the Fed’s favorite inflation metric.

As such, here's a detailed look at the key events to watch as the calendar flips to July:

1. Fed Chair Powell at the ECB Forum - July 2

Federal Reserve Chair Jerome is set to make an appearance at the ECB Forum on Central Banking in Sintra, Portugal on Tuesday, July 2.

Powell has used this platform in the past to pre-announce key policy decisions, making his remarks potentially pivotal.

Investors will scrutinize his speech for hints about the Fed's future policy direction, especially ahead of the critical FOMC meeting at the end of the month.

2. U.S. Jobs Report - Friday, July 5

The U.S. Labor Department will release the monthly jobs report at 8:30 AM ET on Friday, July 5, and it will be a critical indicator of the health of the U.S. labor market.

With employment numbers serving as a bellwether for economic stability and growth, investors will be keenly observing job creation, , and wage growth. Forecasts center around a continued solid pace of hiring, even if the increase is smaller than in previous months.

The consensus estimate is that the the U.S. economy added 180,000 positions in June, slowing from jobs growth of 272,000 in May. The unemployment rate is seen holding steady at 4.0%.

Source: Investing.com

A strong jobs report could reinforce confidence in the economy, while weaker-than-expected numbers might raise concerns about a potential slowdown.

3. U.S. CPI Data - Thursday, July 11

On Thursday, July 11, the Consumer Price Index ( ) inflation data will be released. This report will be closely monitored as inflation remains a central issue for both the Federal Reserve and the broader market.

While no official forecasts have been set yet, expectations for annual headline CPI range from an increase of 3.0% to 3.2%, compared to a 3.3% annual pace in May.

Meanwhile, estimates for the year-on-year figure - which does not include food and energy prices - center around an increase of 3.1%-3.3%, compared to May’s 3.4% reading.

Source: Investing.com

The headline annual CPI rate peaked at a 40-year high of 9.1% in the summer of 2022 and has been on a steady downtrend since, however, prices are still rising at a pace well above the Fed’s 2% target range despite a series of 11 rate hikes.

Any surprises in the inflation figures could significantly impact market sentiment and expectations for future Fed policy actions.

4. Q2 Earnings Season Kickoff - July 12

The second-quarter earnings season kicks off on Friday, July 12 with JPMorgan Chase (NYSE: ) releasing its quarterly results. Earnings reports will be crucial in assessing the health and performance of corporate America amid economic uncertainties.

Key companies reporting in July include:

Tesla (NASDAQ: ) on July 23

Meta Platforms (NASDAQ: ) on July 24

Microsoft (NASDAQ: ) and Alphabet (NASDAQ: ) on July 25

Amazon (NASDAQ: ) on July 30

These tech giants, which have been major contributors to the market's year-to-date rally, will be under the spotlight. Their earnings and guidance will provide valuable insights into the state of the tech sector and broader market trends.

Some of the other notable companies reporting results also include Bank of America (NYSE: ), Goldman Sachs (NYSE: ), Morgan Stanley (NYSE: ), Netflix (NASDAQ: ), American Express (NYSE: ), Visa (NYSE: ), Coca-Cola (NYSE: ), United Airlines (NASDAQ: ), Ford (NYSE: ), General Motors (NYSE: ), Boeing (NYSE: ), Caterpillar (NYSE: ), AT&T (NYSE: ), Verizon (NYSE: ), ExxonMobil (NYSE: ), and Chevron (NYSE: ).

FOMC Meeting - Wednesday, July 31

The Federal Reserve's FOMC policy meeting on Wednesday, July 31 will arguably be the most anticipated event of the month.

With ongoing debates about the appropriate timing for rate cuts, the Fed's statement and Chairman Powell's subsequent press conference will be closely watched.

The FOMC is not publishing updated ‘dot-plot’ economic forecasts, and so any changes in the Fed's tone or policy outlook could have significant implications for the stock market.

As of Friday morning, financial markets are pricing in a roughly 90% chance of no action, according to the Investing.com . That would leave the benchmark Fed funds target range between 5.25% and 5.50%, where it has been since July 2023.

Source: Investing.com

Coming into 2024, investors were expecting multiple rate cuts. However, stubbornly high levels of inflation and signs of a resilient economy have continually pushed back that possibility.

Conclusion

July promises to be a month packed with critical events that could shape the stock market's trajectory for the remainder of the year. From key economic data releases to pivotal central bank meetings and corporate earnings reports, investors must stay vigilant and prepared for potential volatility.

To navigate the current market backdrop I used the InvestingPro stock screener to build a watchlist of high-quality stocks that are showing strong relative strength and have healthy growth prospects.

Investing.com,https://www.investing.com/analysis/affirm-holdings-stock-buy-now-and-get-paid-later-200649662,2024-07-02,06:11:00 UTC,Affirm Holdings Stock: Buy Now and Get Paid Later?,"Affirm is a leading buy-now-pay-later (BNPL) provider that enables consumers to make purchases and pay for them in installments over time.

The company is still losing money but generated 51.2% YoY revenue growth in fiscal Q3 2024 as gross merchandise volume (GMV) grew 36% YoY to $6.3 billion.

It plans to take over the BNPL business in the U.S. for Apple Pay users as Apple ends its in-house BNPL business, but Affirm states the partnership won’t have a material impact in fiscal 2025.

Affirm Holdings (NASDAQ: ) is a leader in the buy-now-pay-later (BNPL) industry. They provide installment loans to consumers, enabling them to split purchases into smaller payments. This is a win-win for merchants as they make more sales and customers as they can afford to purchase items that may have been previously too cost-prohibitive to pay for upfront. Historically, the stock has rallied into and during the when BNPL volume is highest. Investors may plan to get in early this year on the potential run-up into and through the holidays.

Affirm operates in the business services sector and competes with Block (NYSE: ) Afterpay, PayPal Holdings (NASDAQ: ), Sezzle (NASDAQ: ), and Zip Co. Ltd.

The Boom and Burst of the Buy-Now-Pay-Later Industry

BNPL has exploded in popularity but faced plenty of scrutiny from consumer advocates claiming it encourages overspending and bad shopping habits. The business model has also come under fire due to rising delinquencies. It caused shares of Affirm to topple from a peak of $176.65 on Nov. 8, 2021. While the perceived lack of interest rates or fees and reporting to credit bureaus or credit checks is tempting, a good chunk of BNPL users tend to have lower credit scores and limited access to credit due to poor payment history. Gen-Z-ers tend to be the majority of BNPL users. This demographic is skeptical about credit cards, making them ripe for BNPL lenders.

Rising Fraud and Federal Oversight Impacting the BNPL Industry

This distinction may be having a blowback effect now as default rates climb. Additionally, rising fraud is becoming more than a thorn in the side of providers and merchants. BNPL companies are now being watched by the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB) like credit card providers under the Truth in Lending Act. The CFPB confirmed that BNPL companies are indeed credit card providers that also provide the same legal protections and rights that apply to credit cards. Consumers have a right to dispute charges and demand a refund after returning the product to the merchant. BNPL companies must also provide billing statements as credit card companies do.

Apple Hands Off BNPL to Affirm

On June 11, 2024, Affirm confirmed that Apple Inc (NASDAQ: ). would leave the BNPL business and enable Apple Pay users to apply and pay over time with Affirm. This caused shares to surge 5% to $39.25. While this is great headline news for Affirm, the company does not expect the partnership to have a material impact on gross merchandise volume (GMV) or revenue in fiscal 2025.

Affirm's Financial Performance: Q3 Growth and Raised Q4 Guidance

Affirm reported a fiscal Q3 2024 EPS loss of 43 cents, which beat EPS estimates by 27 cents, as consensus estimates were for a loss of 70 cents. Revenues surged 51.2% YoY to $576 million, beating $550 million consensus estimates. Revenue Less Transaction Costs (RLTC) rose 38% YoY to $231 million, with RLTC as a percentage of GMV rising to 3.7%, up from 3.6% in the year-ago period. RLTC is a measure of its core earnings, measuring the revenue received, including merchant fees and interest income, minus all the costs associated with facilitating the loan transaction, such as processing fees and fraud prevention costs. GMV rose 36% YoY to $6.3 billion, marking the fourth consecutive quarter of growth.

Affirm raised its fiscal Q4 2024 revenue guidance to $585 million to $605 million versus $578.68 million consensus estimates. GMV is expected to be between $6.75 billion and $6.95 billion. Adjusted operating margin is expected to be between 15% and 17%. The company is also rolling out additional payment options, including Pay in 2 (installments) or Pay in 30 (days).

The Affirm Card Volume is Seasonal, But Lots More Features Are Coming

During its conference call, the subject of the Affirm Card was brought up. The Affirm Card is a physical and digital debit card that can be linked to a bank account. It can be used as a debit card and may have the BNPL option, which can be accessed through the app. The card is only available to qualified applicants; not every purchase may have a BNPL option. In fact, each purchase must be applied for BNPL through the mobile app. Plans with four installments have a 0% annual percentage rate (APR). The interest rate for installment plans beyond four payments can range from 0% to 36%.

Affirm CEO Max Levchin confirmed that the volume growth on the Affirm Card is entirely seasonal. They aren't promoting it aggressively yet, as they are experimenting with various rewards. Levchin confirmed it is ""squarely trending towards a multi-billion dollar business."" Levchin assured that they have a lot of features to roll out.

As the stock market continues to show volatility today, three companies are capturing investors’ attention due to significant news and price movements. Tesla, Chewy Inc, and Walgreens Boots Alliance are all experiencing notable shifts in their stock prices and facing key developments that could impact their future performance.

Tesla Stock Gains Ahead of Q2 Vehicle Deliveries Report

Tesla’s stock is surging today, up 6.51% to $210.76, as investors eagerly await the company’s Q2 global vehicle deliveries report, set to be released on Tuesday, July 2, 2024.



Despite the current rally, Tesla’s year-to-date return remains negative at -15.10%. Analysts are predicting Q2 deliveries of around 436,000 vehicles, representing a 6.5% decrease from Q2 2023 but a 13% increase from Q1 2024. Some analysts are even more conservative, forecasting deliveries in the 410,000-425,000 range.

Beyond vehicle deliveries, investors are also focusing on Tesla’s energy storage business. The company deployed a record 4,053 MWh of energy storage in Q1 2024, with CEO Elon Musk projecting 200-300% year-over-year growth in this segment. Additionally, Tesla plans to unveil its “robotaxi” on August 8, 2024, which is seen as a potential catalyst for future growth.

Chewy Inc Stock Becomes Volatile After GameStop Short Squeeze Trader Announces Massive Stake

Chewy’s stock experienced significant volatility today following news that Keith Gill, known as “Roaring Kitty” from the 2021 GameStop (NYSE: ) meme stock rally, has disclosed a 6.6% stake in the company.



The stock initially surged 15% in premarket trading but has since reversed those gains, currently trading down 6.15% at $25.57. Gill’s stake, worth about $245 million, makes him the third-largest shareholder in Chewy.

Despite today’s downturn, Chewy’s year-to-date return remains positive at 8.19%. The online pet food and medicine retailer, founded by current GameStop CEO Ryan Cohen, has maintained stable sales despite weaker overall consumer spending. However, the company’s P/E ratio of 143.37 and negative 5-year return of -26.96% highlight the challenges it faces in a competitive e-commerce landscape.

Walgreens Boots Alliance Slides After Boots CEO Quits

Walgreens Boots Alliance stock is down 4.18% today to $11.59, continuing a troubling trend for the company. WBA’s year-to-date return stands at -54.48%, with a staggering 5-year return of -73.13%. The company recently missed Q3 earnings expectations and has been under pressure due to a weak outlook.

Adding to investor concerns, Boots CEO Sebastian James announced he would leave the company in November 2024 after six years in the role.



This news comes as WBA has decided against selling or floating Boots for the second time in two years. Despite these challenges, under James’ leadership, Boots’ market share has grown for 13 successive quarters, with recent results showing total UK sales growth of 1.6% and comparable retail sales growth of 6%.

Perhaps that was the ultimate contrarian indicator, as the stock price fell from an intraday high of $140 on June 20th (Thursday) to a closing price of $118 on June 24th (Monday). That’s a loss of $542 billion in market cap over a three-day period.

NVDA is another bubble among the various asset bubble charts throughout history starting with the 1600’s Dutch tulip bulb bubble on the upper left (source: @great_martis):

We’re being told that “it’s different this time” with respect to NVDA’s market cap. One portfolio manager was on CNBC saying he expects NVDA to hit a $6 trillion market cap this year “as investors realize how cheap the stock is” That would be a double from the current stock price. It’s a laughable prediction. That would take the trailing P/E to 144, the forward P/E to 68x and the price/sales to 76x. I just don’t see it happening.

The bulls seem to believe that NVDA will maintain its lead in AI chips and near-monopolistic pricing power in perpetuity. It won’t. At some point competitors will bring competitive chips to market at lower prices. Plus, most are overlooking the fact that semiconductors are a highly cyclical industry. The proliferation of AI will not change that. At some point the market will become saturated with NVDA’s chips and its business will be subjected to the law of supply and demand.

NVDA’s share price has a history of boom/bust cycles. On a split-adjusted basis after the recent 10:1 stock split, NVDA went from 5 cents in October 1999 to as high as 61 cents in January 2002. By September 2002 it had dropped back to 7 cents. Between September 2004 and October 2007, another stock bubble era, NVDA ran from 12 cents to as high as 99 cents. By November 2008 it had dropped to as low as 14 cents. The cliff-dive in “Dutch tulip bulb” charts happens much more quickly than the ascent to the top of the cliff. It won’t be different this time.

After that three-day plunge, NVDA stabilized at its 21 DMA (light blue ma line, $123.21 on Friday). Volume has tailed off considerably and the RSI/MACD momentum indicators are heading south. Those three attributes suggest the stock is losing “energy.” Also, the last three days of the week the stock closed well off of its highs of the day.","Perhaps that was the ultimate contrarian indicator, as the stock price fell from an intraday high of $140 on June 20th (Thursday) to a closing price of $118 on June 24th (Monday).

This stock is trending on Yahoo! Finance today because the U.S. Food and Drug Administration granted another one of its products a special status. Humacyte Inc (NASDAQ: ) is building bioengineered tissues that can be implanted into patients.

The the company a third Regenerative Medicine Advanced Therapy (RMAT) designation for its Acellular Tissue Engineered Vessel (ATEV), which targets advanced peripheral artery disease (PAD). The designation is aimed at expediting the review process for regenerative therapies that target serious illnesses. The FDA also cleared Humacyte's investigational new drug (IND) application for its ATEV for PAD.

Humacyte spiked around 11% on Monday, and is up some 85% year to date.





Arcutis Biotherapeutics

This commercial-stage biopharmaceutical company is working on treatments for skin diseases like psoriasis, eczema and atopic dermatitis. Currently, Arcutis Biotherapeutics Inc (NASDAQ: ) offers cream to treat plaque psoriasis and a foam to treat seborrheic dermatitis on the market, both with the active ingredient roflumilast sold under the Zoryve brand name.

Arcutis' pipeline contains three products: ARQ-252 to treat inflammatory skin diseases like chronic hand eczema; ARQ-255 for alopecia areata; and ARQ-234, potentially to target atopic dermatitis.

The company's stock has skyrocketed year to date, climbing some 200% as of this writing.

Monday was actually an excellent day for several biotech stocks — not just Humacyte. For Arcutis, investors are anticipating an FDA ruling on its supplemental NDA for its roflumilast cream to treat atopic dermatitis in patients as young as six years old. That ruling is expected on July 7.

Inhibikase Therapeutics

Inhibikase Therapeutics Inc (NASDAQ: ) is developing some promising treatments for Parkinson's disease and other neurodegenerative diseases. The company's lead candidate is risvodetinib for various stages of Parkinson's patients in the early stage of the disease or who have never been treated for the illness.

The drug candidate is also in trials for constipation stemming from nerve disease or injury, difficulty swallowing, and multiple system atrophy (MSA), an illness with some similarities to Parkinson's for which the FDA has not yet approved a single treatment.

IKT stock is down around 12% year to date, so there may be some gas left in the tank with this one in the near term.

Bicycle Therapeutics

Bicycle Therapeutics Ltd (NASDAQ: ) is developing treatments for underserved patient populations via a totally new approach to targeting disease. The company describes the new kind of novel molecule it has developed as ""bicycles,"" which differ from conventional small molecules in that they can easily be conjugated to other chemical payloads without losing their desired pharmacology.

Notably, Bicycle has some strong collaborations in place, including with Novartis (SIX: ) and Bayer (OTC: ) Consumer Care. The company's pipeline currently includes: BT8009, in Phase 2/3 trials; BT5528, in Phase 2/ Expansion trials; and BT1718, also in Phase 2/ Expansion trials. All candidates target various kinds of cancer.

Bicycle stock is up 11% year to date, so for investors interested in this company's novel approach, there may still be some near-term upside.

Small-cap biotech ETFs

Investors who don't want to pick individual small-cap biotech stocks might consider an exchange-traded fund, although ETFs sometimes miss out on the most promising companies in the very earliest stages. In fact, it's extremely challenging to zero in on small-cap biotech because most ETFs focused on the sector target larger names.

Nonetheless, you can uncover some particularly interesting biotech ETFs by zeroing in on an area of particular interest. For example, the Range Oncology Therapeutics Index ETF (NASDAQ: ) may be of interest to investors who want to support cancer treatment with their investment dollars.

This ETF is nearly flat year to date, up by about 1%.

Some other interesting ETFs include:

ALPS Medical Breakthroughs ETF (NYSE: ) – up 2% YTD

Global X Genomics & Biotechnology ETF (NASDAQ: ) – off 10% YTD

AdvisorShares Psychedelics ETF (NYSE: ) – down 30% YTD

WisdomTree BioRevolution Fund (NYSE: ) – off 6% YTD

For a broader view on the biotech sector, some options include the iShares Biotechnology ETF (NASDAQ: ), the SPDR® S&P Biotech ETF (NYSE: ), and the VanEck Biotech ETF (NASDAQ: ).

Of course, investors are always advised to do their own due diligence before investing in any stock or theme.","In no particular order, here are four small-cap biotech stocks that could make for some interesting trading ideas for investors interested in the sector.

Investing.com,https://www.investing.com/analysis/2-major-reversal-patterns-sp-500-bulls-will-look-to-avoid-this-week-200649626,2024-07-01,06:58:00 UTC,2 Major Reversal Patterns S&P 500 Bulls Will Look to Avoid This Week,"Stocks finished last week mostly flat to lower, with the down by around 40 bps on Friday, while the finished lower by around 50 bps. This came following a Friday morning rally met by selling that started a bit after 10 a.m.

The selling was enough to push the S&P 500 more than 1% off its morning highs and create a bearish engulfing candle on the daily chart. It was the second such candle in a week.

This has created 2 key reversal patterns that the bulls will look to avoid this week:

1. 2B Daily Top Reversal Pattern

It also created what appears to be a 2b top reversal pattern. These patterns don’t always work, but they are nice to use because they give us levels to work with that tell us a lot about where the market may be heading.

This pattern often forms when an index or stock attempts to make a new, fails to hold that high, and then closes below the previous closing high.

2. Weekly Close Pattern

Even on the weekly candle, we saw this week’s high surpass last week’s high, with the index closing lower on the week. This doesn’t happen often, but it has happened several times since January 2020.

Over that time, it appears to have occurred eight other times, and 7 of those times, it has led to a lower week the following week. In 5 of the seven occasions, it led to declines of 35.3%, 11.2%, 14.4%, 12.9%, and 19.3%.

On the other two occasions, the index fell by 2.1%; on the other, it fell by 2.5%. There was only one time the index moved higher: in January 2021. So, the signal carries some weight with it and should not be ignored or easily dismissed.

This tells us a couple of things that we can use to help us better assess what comes next. If the S&P 500 closes above 5,487.02 on the daily chart this week, the daily 2b top trading pattern will be invalidated.

The weekly reversal candle will be invalidated if the S&P 500 closes above 5464.61 on the weekly chart.

People will look at this and say it is ridiculous to think that the S&P 500 could drop by some of the abovementioned values. I could also argue that it would have been foolish to believe that the S&P 500 could rally as much as it has since the October 2023 low.

It took the S&P 500 271 days to rally approximately 18% from 4,100 on April 8, 2021, to the intraday high of 4,818 on January 4, 2022, when overnight rates were 0%, and the Fed was conducting QE. It has taken the S&P 500 245 days to rally 34.4% from its low on October 27 of 4,100 to its intraday high the week of June 28, with overnight rates of 5.33% and the Fed draining the balance sheet.

Which one sounds more ridiculous now? So caution is warranted currently, and being cautious is not the same as being short or perma bearish. It is about assessing the odds and managing one’s risk.

Some conditions in this market are at extremes, especially regarding implied correlations, which closed below 6, the lowest level ever, not by a little but by more than a whole point at 5.59 versus the previous low of 6.78 in October 2017.

Meanwhile, high-yield credit spreads are trending higher as stock prices rise. We last saw these conditions develop in January 2020 and the fall of 2021.

In the meantime, the appears to be in the process of completing a giant ascending broadening wedge, as the 20-day moving average is serving as support for the ETF. A break of support at $255 would confirm that the pattern has broken and that a move lower has begun.

Meanwhile, Nvidia (NASDAQ: ) is wedged between the 10-day exponential and the 20-day simple moving averages, which means that things are quite easy because a close above the 10-day EMA could signal a move higher, followed by confirmation, which could lead to pushback to $130. A close below the 20-day moving average, followed by confirmation, could open the floodgates.

That’s all from me. You may not hear from me again until July 10.

Have a happy Fourth of July!

The major indexes are reaching new highs and portraying an image of economic health and investor confidence. However, beneath this seemingly strong facade lies a troubling sign for market participants: a significant deterioration in market breadth.

Market breadth is a crucial measure that indicates the overall market's health. It reflects the number of stocks participating in the uptrend. Currently, while major indexes like the and are climbing, most individual stocks within these indexes are underperforming. This divergence suggests that the gains are being driven by a few large-cap stocks, masking the struggles of the majority.

This trend of narrowing market breadth has persisted throughout the year. Such a scenario can sustain an upward trajectory for the indexes in the short term, driven by the performance of a select few. However, it also increases the likelihood of a market pullback, especially as these indexes become overextended.

With the current market advance showing signs of reaching an overbought state, it’s a critical time for investors to exercise caution. The disparity between index performance and individual stock performance serves as a warning that the market's strength may be more fragile than it appears on the surface.

Visualizing the Divergence: A Tale of Two Indexes

In the chart below, we have a clear visual representation of the growing disparity in market performance. The top panel illustrates the capitalization-weighted S&P 500, which, as noted in the introduction, has continued its ascent, reaching new highs and showcasing the robust performance of the largest stocks within the index. The lower panel, however, tells a different story. This panel displays the , where each stock contributes equally to the index, offering a more balanced view of the broader market's health.

From the start of the year until the end of March, both indexes moved in harmony, reflecting a broad-based rally where gains were relatively evenly distributed among the stocks. However, the divergence that began in April is striking. While the capitalization-weighted S&P 500 maintained its upward momentum, driven by a handful of dominant large-cap stocks, the Equal Weighted S&P 500 began to falter, trending downward. This negative divergence highlights that the majority of stocks within the index have not shared in the recent gains, revealing a troubling decline in market breadth.

The significance of this divergence cannot be overstated. It underscores the cautionary message from the introduction: despite the impressive performance of the headline index, underlying market strength is weakening. The few stocks leading the charge higher can mask the broader market's struggles, but this imbalance often precedes corrections or pullbacks, especially when the market becomes overly extended. Investors should be wary of this trend, as it suggests that the apparent resilience of the market may be more fragile and susceptible to reversal than it appears on the surface.

Divergence Deepens: A Closer Look at Market Breadth

The next chart provides a deeper dive into the evolving landscape of market breadth and further underscores the cautionary signals we've been discussing. The top panel depicts the S&P 500, which has been on an impressive upward trajectory since emerging from a short-term pullback at the end of October 2023. This rally has carried the index to new heights through June 2024, reflecting an ostensibly strong and resilient market.

However, the middle and bottom panels reveal a starkly different narrative. The middle panel tracks the percentage of stocks within the S&P 500 that are above their respective 200-day moving averages, a long-term trend indicator. Since April 2024, this percentage has been in a consistent decline, suggesting that fewer stocks are maintaining their long-term uptrends despite the index's continued advance.

The bottom panel paints an even more concerning picture, showing the percentage of stocks above their 50-day moving averages, a short-term trend indicator. This percentage has been falling since January 2024, indicating that a majority of stocks are failing to sustain even their short-term momentum. The divergence between the S&P 500's performance and the weakening trend participation of its components is clear and concerning.

Notably, the chart highlights the month of June 2024 with a vertical blue line, drawing attention to the continued advance of the S&P 500 during this period. Despite this upward movement, both the middle and bottom panels indicate that the percentage of stocks above their moving averages remained flat, failing to confirm the index's gains. This sideways movement in June suggests a further erosion of market breadth, highlighting that the index's rally is increasingly being driven by a shrinking number of outperforming stocks.

Conclusion

In summary, despite the impressive advance of major indexes like the S&P 500, underlying market strength is weakening. The declining participation of stocks in this rally highlights a troubling divergence and signals a fragile foundation. Investors should approach the market with caution, mindful that the impressive gains of a few cannot indefinitely mask the broader market’s fragility and the increased risk of a significant pullback.

Current Portfolio Allocation: Emphasizing Defense

Given the current market environment, we have positioned all client accounts with a distinctly defensive posture. Our strategy includes an oversized allocation to cash and high-yielding money market funds, ensuring liquidity and stability amid market uncertainties. Additionally, our equity exposure is kept deliberately low, complemented by strategic short positions to serve as hedges against potential market downturns.

One of the key reasons behind our conservative stance on stocks is the prevailing market dynamics that tend to undermine stock performance in environments like this. As discussed earlier, market breadth has been deteriorating, meaning that an increasing number of stocks are struggling or declining.

In such scenarios, the chances of successfully navigating the stock market diminish significantly. Historically, investing in stocks during periods of narrowing breadth often results in subpar returns, as overall market strength is primarily driven by a select few outperformers, while the majority lag or falter.

By maintaining a cautious allocation and focusing on defensive assets, we aim to protect capital and reduce the potential for losses, positioning our clients to weather any volatility that may arise from the current market fragility.","The disparity between index performance and individual stock performance serves as a warning that the market's strength may be more fragile than it appears on the surface.

Investing.com,https://www.investing.com/analysis/sp-500-a-look-at-sector-eps-revenue-growth-trends-heading-into-q2-24-200649633,2024-07-01,06:15:00 UTC,"S&P 500: A Look at Sector EPS, Revenue Growth Trends Heading Into Q2 ’24","Q2 ’24 SP earnings will start in the next two weeks – the big banks should start reporting by Friday, July 12th, ’24.

The above table reflects the historical trends in EPS and revenue growth, starting with Q1 ’23, and for the last two quarters shows how the estimates changed during the Q4 ’23 reporting period and then again for Q1 ’24’s reporting period.

Data source: LSEG (formerly IBES data by Refinitiv)

Here’s what jumped out in looking at this table:

1.) The technology sector still faces a very weak comp in Q2 ’24, versus the Q2 ’23 numbers: tech sector EPS grew only 5% on flat revenue in Q2 ’23. Today, the tech sector EPS is expected to grow 16.9% in Q2 ’24, on revenue growth of 6.7% y-o-y.

More importantly, readers should look at the technology EPS line in Q1 ’23 and then read across (right to left) and note where tech sector EPS growth estimates started in Q4 ’23 and Q1 ’24 and then ended 12 weeks later. Tech sector revenue was pretty much unchanged (no real trend in revenue growth) the last two quarters.

2.) Energy sector: energy sector growth has been negative the last 4 quarters but is expected it improve sharply in Q2 ’24. Same with energy revenue growth, but revenue has been negative the last 5 quarters, i.e. Q1 ’23 through Q1 ’24, but is expected to be +6.4% in Q2 ’24.

3.) Communication services: look at the trend improvement in EPS in Q1 ’24 for Comm Services (i.e. META (NASDAQ: ) and Google (NASDAQ: ) is the lion’s share of the sector). META is now facing tough comps since the stock bottomed in Q3 ’23, and margin grew sharply from there. The easy money may have been made for META, to this point, which is not to say the stock goes down, but META’s operating margin did grow sharply in ’23 and Q1 ’24.

4.) The capital tests for the bank led to a number of buybacks and dividend increases for the big banks on Friday night, June 28, ’24. Let’s see if the financial sector EPS gets a bump into the month of July ’24, as I’m expecting it to do. Capital markets activity, like bond issuance, should still be fairly healthy, although the IPO market seems quiet.

5.) Finally the healthcare sector is expecting it’s best EPS growth since Q1 ’22 in Q2 ’24 at +20.2%. It’s had a horrid string of negative y-o-y growth EPS quarters since Q4 ’22. Healthcare revenue growth is rock solid. Hasn’t wavered much at all although it was mid-teens growth in ’21 and ’22, that has tapered down to mid-single-digits in ’23 and now ’24 no doubt as the Covid vaccines have faded. GLP-1 drugs have really helped growth – even Pfizer (NYSE: ) says they are experimenting with one, although they are well behind the curve.

If readers own just the 5 sectors mentioned that is 70% of the S&P 500’s market cap as of this weekend. No mention was made of consumer discretionary since EPS slowed down from 40% – 50%+ growth in ’23 to 20% – 30% in Q4 ’23 and Q1 ’24, while revenue growth slowed from high-single-digits to mid-single-digits from ’23 into ’24. Tesla’s slowdown in revenue and EPS growth has had to hurt the sector, although Amazon (NASDAQ: ) remains pretty stable. (Amazon and Tesla (NASDAQ: ) were the two biggest sector weights in early ’23.)

Conclusion:

These historical sectors EPS and revenue growth (estimate vs actual) go all the way back to 2010 and 2011, but that data really isn’t relevant today. I started logging the values just to see what was “high, average and low” growth rates, but Covid really skewed the data, resulting in exceptionally high and low figures.

Q2 ’21 saw 96% EPS growth for the S&P 500 on 25% revenue growth. Obviously, that’s not anything near normal.

Q2 ’22 S&P 500 EPS growth is expected at +10.6%, the best quarter of EPS growth since Q1 ’22, while expected revenue growth at +4.2% is the strongest quarter expected since Q1 ’23’s +5.6% actual growth.

Disclosure: Anyway, none of this is advice or a recommendation, but rather an opinion. The goal through the summer will be to see how revenue and EPS growth by sector track versus the starting estimates on June 30 ’24. Past performance is no guarantee of future results. Investing can involve the loss of principal, even for short periods of time. All EPS and revenue data is sourced from the London Stock Exchange Group (www.LON: .com).

Readers can see the expectations for June's nonfarm payroll results in the above table. The unemployment report has risen from a low of 3.2% post-pandemic to 4% as of last month. While the nonfarm payroll number is the business survey and thus more closely followed by investors, the unemployment rate matters greatly to politicians since that one single number can sum up the political environment in one single digit.

The Fed has gotten inflation down as low as it can, without labor market weakness dropping it further.

The constant talk about rate cuts by the Fed, will likely be just that – talk – until labor market weakness surfaces.

Hard to say when that happens.

The fact is the economy remains in very good shape.

The Core PCE data for May reported this morning, fell to +2.6%, versus +2.8% last month. The Fed’s almost there…

S&P 500 Data:

The forward 4-quarter estimate slipped a little this week to $252.85 from last weeks $253.84;

The PE ratio on the forward estimate is now 21.6x versus 21.55x last week;

The earnings yield slipped to 4.63% from last weeks 4.64% even though the S&P 500 fell slightly on the week;

With this being the last week of reporting for Q1 ’24, the S&P 500 EPS rose +8.2% (after bottoming at 5% on April 5th) while S&P 500 revenue rose +3.95%, after bottoming at 3% on April 5th, ’24.

Expect Q2 ’24 revisions to be negative next week but the strength in expected Q2 ’24 EPS and revenue growth has been unusually solid at +10.6% expected EPS growth and +4.2% revenue growth.

Conclusion:

The holiday-shortened week will likely mean lean trading desks the morning of the nonfarm payroll report on July 5th, ’24.

In these quarterly letters we share our performance highlights and trends that are shaping our investment approach.

Spear Alpha ETF (NASDAQ: ) was up 4.22% in 1Q24 compared to the , up 10.56%, and the , up 9.31%. Over the past year, SPRX was up 56.2% vs. the S&P500 29.9% and the Nasdaq Composite up 35.08%.

Summary:

As interest rates rose in 1Q24, investors shifted to playing defense, increasing their exposure to mega caps and defensive sectors like utilities. We responded to this by focusing on risk management, limiting our underperformers, and positioning ourselves to capture the next wave of opportunities. These periods of consolidation create the best entry points (both for investing in our fund and for us to find opportunities).

After a strong finish to 2023 with excitement over interest rate cuts, 2024 started on a defensive note, with interest rates trickling up and expectations for rate cuts lowered from seven rate cuts to potentially none. As a result, the market outperformance has been driven by mega-cap technology and sectors like utilities, which indicate that investors are playing defense.

The average member within the Nasdaq has had a >35% drawdown from peak this year while, the has had no more than a 7% drawdown, demonstrating how bifurcated this year's performance has been between mega-caps and the rest of the space.

During these periods of consolidation (risk-off), like in 1Q24, we shift our focus to risk management. But unlike most funds, where risk management means reducing risk, for us, it means managing risk and selectively increasing it, especially after periods like May, when we saw panic selling, particularly in software. These drawdowns allow us to add to our high-conviction ideas at attractive prices.

There is no question that we are in the early innings of the next technology cycle amplified by AI. What has been unusual about this recovery is that instead of the Federal Reserve stimulating the economy, it is providing a headwind. In the short run investor sentiment is very much tied to interest rates, which we expect to remain range-bound. As rates increase towards 5%, investors turn to risk-off, and the economy weakens (jobs, consumer sentiment, inflation down); conversely, as rate cuts take the front seat and the declines, investors turn to risk-on.

These periods of consolidation create the best entry points (both for investing in our fund and for us to find opportunities).

How Do We Manage Risk?

We have two main tools for risk management:

1. We increase our idea velocity: during periods of consolidation, we increase the pace of generating new ideas (e.g., in the past 3-4 months, we have increased our exposure further down the data center value chain, specifically expanding to areas ""outside of the rack"" including materials, components, and electricity generation).

2. We take profits on outperformers and cut/reduce losers. The most important aspect of this is that we try to maintain the same level of risk so that when the market turns to risk-on, we are positioned to capture the benefit.

Fundamental active strategies, in general, perform better in a risk-on environment as investors are looking to allocate to ideas that capture alpha and broaden their exposure beyond just tracking broader market.

What Gives Us Confidence for the Rest of the Year:

Capex spending cycle just kicked in. Coming out of the 1Q24 earnings season, a constant theme was increased capex. Expectations for hyperscaler capex growth are now +40% yoy vs. ~20% as we entered the year with the five largest hyperscalers investing >$200B. Estimates for '25 are >$250B which could prove to be conservative as Nvidia (NASDAQ: )'s Blackwell (B100) chip is entering production and offers significantly lower TCO (total cost of ownership).

Attractive valuations. Valuations for mega-cap technology have expanded over the past 6 months but are still within historical ranges. Valuations for mid-caps (<$100B), especially on the software side, have pulled back meaningfully and are near the '20 and '22 lows.

Performance contributors and commentary

The most significant change to our portfolio in '24 vs. '23 was that we expanded our Data Center hardware investments beyond processors (GPUs) and created a new focus area, ""Materials & Power Generation,"" which we expect will benefit from a broader data center build-out.

The types of companies included in this area are 1) materials such as , 2) components such as electrical equipment, connectors, and thermal management, and 3) power generation, including independent power generators. As many of these companies are cyclical, the turnover of this basket is higher than some of our other focus areas, where we often maintain our holdings through the cycle (in varying sizes).

For 1Q24 our out-performers were:

Data Center Hardware. Nvidia (NVDA) stood out and was our best-performing idea in the quarter and ytd. AMD (NASDAQ: ) and Marvell (NASDAQ: ) also outperformed the rest of our portfolio but underperformed our expectations. The underperformance is because while AI is a positive contributor for these companies, it is not material enough to offset weakness in the rest of their businesses. We are being patient with these companies as we expect that it may take 1+ years to scale their new products.

We are being patient with these companies as we expect that it may take 1+ years to scale their new products. Materials and Power Generation. Freeport McMoran (NYSE: ) and Teck Resources (NYSE: ) outperformed the rest of our portfolio. Since the end of the quarter, we took some profit in copper and redeployed it to other areas in power generation and connectors.

Our underperformers were Cybersecurity and Data Infrastructure companies, which was the reverse of 4Q23. While it may not be obvious from looking at the broad indices, the software sector got destroyed in 1Q24 and continued to face significant pressure, specifically in May. What started as a pull-back turned into carnage, with many companies down 40%+ since the end of 23.

Cybersecurity. Despite ransomware hitting all-time highs and now affecting over 10% of organizations, cybersecurity got caught up in the software sell-off. For cybersecurity specifically, interest rates were the main negative driver, while fundamentals have remained strong. Crowdstrike (CRWD) was the relative outperformer in the quarter vs. Zscaler (NASDAQ: ) (S) and Sentinel One (S) , which meaningfully underperformed.

Data Infrastructure. In addition to interest rates, data infrastructure software did not deliver the expected fundamental improvement in 1Q23. There are two main reasons behind this that we have identified:



1. The initial investment wave in AI has been securing hardware and ""renting"" this hardware as a service. Revenue from selling software services and applications is still in the early days. This is why companies like Datadog (NASDAQ: ), while still growing, are tracking below the historical 2x the rate of AWS growth (Amazon (NASDAQ: )).



2. Companies cut spending during the downturn and were more focused on reaching profitability at the expense of growth, which is now coming back to bite them. A common theme that we are noting is that companies that were supposed to be growing 30-40% are now growing only 20%. Snowflake (NYSE: ) is a prime example. Some of this is a function of weak macro/enterprise spending, but some of it may be related to dropping the ball. We have largely maintained our exposures but are looking to selectively add to the ones that are able to play offense rather than defense.



While we are not concerned about the first point as we are confident that as companies start building on top of the hardware, they will need the software services (especially critical ones like cybersecurity, observability, and data streaming), we are laser-focused on the second to make sure we don't get stuck with the losers.

We are maintaining our balanced positioning between software and hardware, but we have started adding to software on a selective basis, expecting to benefit if interest rates stabilize.

We continue to manage risk actively and asses the potential risk/reward of each individual holding, incorporating the trajectory of earnings and valuation. We aspire to perform in line with diversified indices on the downside, and generate differentiated performance on the upside, given our concentrated portfolio of investments.

TOKYO (Reuters) -The U.S. dollar hit a near 38-year high to the yen on Tuesday following a surge in Treasury yields as investors contemplated prospects of a second Donald Trump presidency.

Japan's weak currency helped lift the above the psychological 40,000 mark for the first time in three months, making the index an outlier as many other regional stock markets struggled.

The dollar rose as high as 161.745 yen on Tuesday, a level not seen since December 1986.

The currency pair is highly sensitive to U.S. yields and the benchmark climbed nearly 14 basis points to 4.479% to start the week.

Analysts attributed the move to expectations for Trump winning the presidency, resulting in higher tariffs and government borrowing. The 10-year yield stood at 4.4415% in Tokyo hours.

President Joe Biden's faltering debate performance last week was the trigger behind the yield surge, but an additional catalyst came with the Supreme Court's ruling on Monday that Trump has broad immunity from prosecution over attempts to overturn his 2020 election loss, said Chris Weston, head of research at Pepperstone.

""Bond traders have an eye on Trump's increasing odds of taking the White House, and the market senses Trump 2.0 will be inflationary,"" Weston said.

The yen's malaise has traders on high alert for Japanese intervention after authorities spent some 9.8 trillion yen ($60.65 billion) in the days spanning late April and early May, when the currency plunged to 160.82 per dollar.

Japanese finance minister Shunichi Suzuki reiterated on Tuesday that officials are watching currency markets with vigilance, but noticeably didn't repeat a warning that they stood ready to act.

""Market participants continued to ignore his comments and appear to be testing the Ministry of Finance's resolve to support the JPY,"" said Carol Kong, a strategist at Commonwealth Bank of Australia (OTC: ).

""The path of least resistance is therefore further gains in .""

As a result, the Nikkei rallied more than 1%, putting it head and shoulders above other major markets in the region.

Hong Kong's added 0.4% amid gains for property stocks, but mainland blue chips were flat, and the tech-heavy Taiwan benchmark dropped 0.74%.

U.S. pointed 0.13% lower, following a 0.27% rise overnight for the cash index.

Pan-European futures were off 0.12%, after the advanced 0.3% on Monday.

The euro gave back some ground to the dollar on Tuesday following a relief rally, with the far-right National Rally (RN) not taking as many votes as some polls had predicted in France's weekend election.

Rival political parties have joined forces to try and prevent the RN from taking a majority in Sunday's second round, bowing out of constituencies where another candidate is better placed. The deadline to drop off the ballot is later on Tuesday.

COLOMBO (Reuters) - Sri Lanka will save $5 billion in interest owed to bilateral creditors as part of its debt restructuring process, President Ranil Wickremesinghe said on Tuesday, adding that the funds will be used to boost dollar reserves and restore growth.

The cash-strapped South Asian country inked deals with China and other creditor nations to restructure about $10 billion in bilateral debt last week following 15 months of negotiations, Wickremesinghe told parliament.

The agreements brought Sri Lanka closer to the end of a debt restructuring process that began in September 2022 after its foreign exchange reserves hit their lowest levels and forced the island nation to default on its foreign debt for the first time.

""Sri Lanka gains multiple benefits from this agreement. The repayment period has been extended by eight years to 2043 and interest rates have been adjusted to 2.1% or less,"" Wickremesinghe said.

""The country stands among middle-income nations that have successfully navigated the debt restructuring process in such a brief time-frame.""

Talks with bondholders to restructure $12.5 billion worth of debt is progressing well and a conclusion is expected soon, Wickremesinghe said, kicking-off a two-day debate on the restructuring process in parliament.

Sri Lanka, whose total external debt is $37 billion, also has to finalise arrangements with China Development Bank to restructure debt of $2.2 billion, according to latest finance ministry data.

The debt rework, which is underpinned by a $2.9 billion International Monetary Fund (IMF) programme, gives Sri Lanka a chance to restore its debt sustainability and use saved funds to improve public services, increase reserves, and reduce domestic interest rates, he added.

Once the entire debt restructuring process is completed Sri Lanka hopes its debt burden will be reduced by $16.9 billion.

SINTRA, Portugal (Reuters) - The European Central Bank's next interest rate cut is still a relatively easy decision, but subsequent moves should only come once inflation is clearly heading towards the 2% target, ECB policymaker Pierre Wunsch said in an interview.

The ECB cut rates in early June but made no commitment about any further moves, arguing inflation was still too high and it lacked the confidence that 2% was within reach.

Wunsch already said at the time that the first two cuts were easy decisions and continues to maintain this view despite more recent figures showing stubborn wages and services price growth.

""If we have no major negative surprises, then based on our forecasts, I would say there is room for a second cut,"" Wunsch, Belgium's central bank governor told Reuters on Monday. ""A small deviation from the projections would not change this view dramatically.""

But even this second cut was not urgent, he said, and the ECB could wait until its next projections are due out in September.

""There is probably a premium in waiting for a meeting with new forecasts that confirm the picture but I would not make that a condition,"" Wunsch said.

Inflation is expected to have slowed to 2.5% last month from 2.6% in May, but the ECB sees a ""bumpy"" path ahead with figures oscillating around current levels for the rest of the year.

This could make it hard to cut again until figures start showing a more decisive move towards 2%.

""To continue with cuts, I would need to have some more comfort that we really are going down from 2.5% inflation to something which is closer to 2%,"" Wunsch said. ""Do you want to go below 1% real spot rates? That's where it becomes a little bit more difficult for me.""

The ECB's deposit rate stands at 3.75% and markets are betting on about 40 basis points of cuts over the rest of the year, or between one and two moves, and also see a total of four cuts in the next 18 months.

While economic growth is rebounding modestly and markets are relatively calm, a first round election victory by the far right in France complicates the picture. Wunsch said more political turbulence is possible given several countries need painful fiscal adjustments after years of excessive spending.

""In Europe as a whole, we now have five countries in excessive deficit procedures,"" he said. ""It's not going to be easy in any of those five countries. I was never expecting that reducing these deficits will be easy.""

But he also played down any talk the ECB could activate an emergency bond purchase scheme in case political stress reverberated in financial markets.

ECB officials have said markets moves need to be unwarranted and disorderly for the ECB to step in, and events so far failed to meet those criteria.

""I think it's very important that we don't give any signal to the market that we have some kind of automaticity, limits, or hard constraints in what we do,"" Wunsch said. ""The rule is that it must be unwarranted and disorderly. It will be a judgment call.""","The ECB cut rates in early June but made no commitment about any further moves, arguing inflation was still too high and it lacked the confidence that 2% was within reach.

SINGAPORE (Reuters) -The dollar was supported by rising U.S. yields and the blowtorch was on low-yielding currencies on Tuesday such as and Japan's yen, which was pinned to its lowest since 1986.

Benchmark 10-year Treasury yields rose nearly 14 basis points to 4.479% overnight, with analysts attributing the move to expectations of Donald Trump winning the U.S. presidency and raising tariffs and government borrowing. On Tuesday, it was last at 4.443% in Asian hours.

As the dollar rose, the euro handed back part of a small rally as the first round of France's election turned out more or less in line with polling. The single currency was last 0.11% lower at $1.07287.

""Trump's better (debate) showing over (President Joe) Biden added to expectations that inflation may pick up pace, yield curves will steepen further and that the USD may continue to trade at a premium,"" said OCBC currency strategist Christopher Wong.

The yen sank to 161.745 per dollar on Tuesday, its weakest in nearly 38 years, extending a downward slide driven mainly by a wide gap in interest rates between the U.S. and Japan.

Japan's finance minister said on Tuesday the authorities were vigilant to sharp currency market moves, but stopped short of giving a clear intervention warning.

The yen was also sinking on crosses as yen bears were wary that the dollar/yen pair was at risk of intervention by Japanese authorities.

Against the euro, the yen touched a lifetime low of 173.67 on Monday and was just shy of that level on Tuesday, while against the Australian dollar, the yen was near its lowest in 33 years as carry trade remained attractive.

""All eyes are now on Friday night's U.S. non-farm payrolls report, with Japanese currency officials desperately hoping it shows signs of sharp labour market cooling to help ease the pressure on themselves and the battered yen,"" said Tony Sycamore, market analyst at IG.

In bonds, at the 10-year tenor, the gap between U.S. and Japanese rates was 340 bps and almost 440 bps at the two-year tenor.

China's yuan, which hit a seven-month low on the dollar last week and has hardly moved since, faces similar pressure with U.S. 10-year yields more than 220 bps higher than Chinese government bond yields.

Robust manufacturing data in China and an announcement from the central bank that it would be borrowing bonds - likely to sell them and steady falling yields, traders said - gave only the briefest fillip to the currency on Monday.

TOKYO (Reuters) -Japan's finance minister said on Tuesday authorities were vigilant to sharp currency market moves, as the yen continued its slump to fresh 38-year lows against the dollar, but stopped short of giving a clear intervention warning.

The change in official daily commentary to reporters, in which an intervention warning has become almost customary, comes as analysts question the effectiveness of such jawboning in stopping sharp yen declines.

""Foreign exchange levels are set by the market reflecting a complex mix of various factors, including inflation, current account balance, market sentiment and speculative moves,"" finance minister Shunichi Suzuki said in a regular post-cabinet meeting news conference.

""We'll continue to closely watch the market,"" he said.

Although Suzuki did say there has been no change in the government's stance, the absence of usual comments on the readiness to intervene marked a break in what had become almost routine for officials.

Yujiro Goto, managing director & chief FX strategist at Nomura, said the official comments on Tuesday pointed to a slight change in tone.

""Repeating the same wording could inevitably weaken the impact (of warnings),"" he said. No change in the wording could also be interpreted by investors that there would be no immediate action yet, he added.

""But I don't think this (absence of intervention warnings) suggests that interventions are less likely now than before,"" he said.

The yen sank to 161.72 per dollar late Monday, its weakest level since 1986, keeping markets on heightened alert for any signs of yen-buying operations from Tokyo to prop up the currency.

It has already fallen more than 12% this year as it continues to be weighed down by stark interest rate differentials between the U.S. and Japan.

Japanese authorities, including Suzuki and top currency diplomat Masato Kanda, escalated their warnings last week when the yen fell past 160 to the dollar, the latest line in the sand traders had drawn for Japan to intervene in the markets.

Suzuki last week said authorities were ""deeply concerned"" about the impact of ""rapid and one-sided"" foreign exchange moves on the economy and would respond appropriately to excessive currency moves.

Suzuki, when asked about the effectiveness of verbal interventions, said in Tuesday's conference that his comments on foreign exchange are generally in response to questions from reporters.

He said he was not in a position to comment on their effectiveness.

A weaker yen is a boon for Japanese exporters, but a headache for policymakers as it increases import costs, adds to inflationary pressures and squeezes households.","By Makiko YamazakiTOKYO (Reuters) -Japan's finance minister said on Tuesday authorities were vigilant to sharp currency market moves, as the yen continued its slump to fresh 38-year lows against the dollar, but stopped short of giving a clear intervention warning.

(Reuters) -Investors are sceptical that the relief rally after France's first-round parliamentary election can last, wary that the outlook for the country's creaking public finances will remain in focus with several political hurdles ahead.

The closely-watched spread French government bonds pay over Germany's retreated from a 12-year high on Monday and bank shares surged as Marine Le Pen's National Rally (RN) scored a win smaller than some polls had expected on Sunday.

The results lessen the chance of an absolute majority for the RN, or a win for the left-wing alliance that came second, and were a relief for markets rattled since the surprise election was called last month.

But investors remained cautious with uncertainty high ahead of a second-round vote on July 7 and beyond, seeing little scope for improvement in France's weak fiscal position as both the far-right and left have pledged big spending increases.

""It would be too premature to say the battle is over,"" said Nicolas Forest, CIO at asset manager Candriam.

""We are at the beginning of a new political era in France and the situation will stay very uncertain and very complicated.""

Even after Monday's bounce, French assets have barely recovered. France's 10-year yield rose to its highest since November on Monday. The French/German bond spread is still over 25 basis points wider than before President Emmanuel Macron called the election on June 9 and not expected to recover any time soon. Shares in France's three biggest lenders are still down 7-12%%.

Underweight French debt, Forest saw scope for the French-German spread to widen to 100 bps even with a hung parliament, where no one party has an outright majority.

The first hurdle is Sunday's second round election.

Leaders of the left-wing alliance and Macron's centrist grouping have indicated they would withdraw their own candidates in districts where another candidate was better placed to beat the RN.

But it was unclear if the pact would always apply if the left-wing candidates were from Jean-Luc Melenchon's far-left France Unbowed party.

Candidates through to the run-off have until Tuesday to decide whether to run or stand down. High turnout on Sunday means France is heading for a record number of three-way run-offs, which are expected to benefit the RN.

""Anything that would increase support for the far-right parties would be the biggest risk from here,"" said Colin Finlayson, co-manager of the Aegon (NYSE: ) Strategic Bond Fund.

TURMOIL AHEAD

An uncertain political environment adds to worries about the long-term challenges for France's stretched finances that saw its credit rating downgraded in May.

With a budget deficit rising to 5.5% of output last year, far higher than European Union rules permit, France faces disciplinary measures from the EU executive.

Given big spending pledges from the RN as well as the left-wing alliance, ""it's difficult to see how you're going to get much through parliament that says reduce spending,"" said David Zahn, head of European fixed income at Franklin Templeton, who remains underweight French debt.

""This is a sea change for France, (the spread) will now have to trade wider because of its fiscal dynamics, its political dynamics.""

The RN has toned down some of its more radical plans and said it would respect the EU's fiscal rules, but it's unclear how much of its plans are funded.

Investors were considering scenarios including ones where legislation is passed on a bill-by-bill basis or Macron tries building a broad majority that would still face instability.

RN leader Jordan Bardella has said he only wants to be Prime Minister if it won an absolute majority.

""If no one gets an absolute majority, you always end up in a situation where you have a government which will have to cobble up together all the time, very complex arrangements across political families which don't have a habit of working together,"" said AXA's chief economist Gilles Moec.

That raises the risk of another election after 12 months, when they are permitted again, investors said, meaning uncertainty persisting.

By Reuters,"BEIJING (Reuters) - China is moving closer to unveiling its financial stability law, which includes setting up a fund to rescue troubled financial institutions, as part of Beijing's broader efforts to prevent systemic financial risks in the world's second-biggest economy.

A revised draft of the bill underwent a second review by the nation's top legislative body, the National People's Congress (NPC) Standing Committee last week. China's legislative body usually passes a bill after a third review.

Here is what we know about the new law and the financial stability guarantee fund:

WHAT IS THE FINANCIAL STABILITY LAW?

The bill is China's first comprehensive piece of legislation specifically focused on the prevention, resolution, and disposal of risk in the country's $66 trillion financial sector, which includes banks, insurers, asset managers and securities firms.

China has previously enacted industry-specific bills for commercial banks, securities and insurance, but this new law fills a crucial gap in the regulatory framework, according to a note by Chinese law firm JunHe.

The law provides ""a top-level design for systemic financial risk prevention and cross-agencies supervision"", addressing the need for better coordination among different financial regulators and market participants to prevent systemic financial risks, analysts at Huatai Securities said in a report on Monday.

The bill underwent the first review in December 2022. New revisions released on Monday said a central financial work leading body would be responsible for decision-making and supervision of financial stability and development policies.

Financial regulators and local governments should also fulfill the responsibilities of preventing and defusing financial risks, according to the revisions.

WHAT IS THE FINANCIAL STABILITY FUND AND HOW IS IT FUNDED?

A key priority of the law is the establishment of a financial stability guarantee fund. The fund is designed as a backup funding source to rescue troubled financial institutions to prevent contagion risks. The fund would primarily raise money from financial institutions, according to the bill.

China's central bank can also provide cheap loans through the relending facility, it said, adding the loans should be repaid by income from the disposal of risky institutions.

The exact size of the fund has not been officially disclosed. However, in 2022, China's banking regulator said the fund had initially raised 64.6 billion yuan ($8.89 billion) from financial institutions.

Eventually the fund is expected to raise 120 billion yuan to 180 billion yuan each year, analysts at China Securities said, which would make it big enough to deal with any major financial crisis.

The fund would cover systemically important financial firms that are ""too big to fail"", such as major banks and insurers, as well as institutions that are identified as having high risks, the analysts said.

To mitigate moral hazard, the bill stipulates that troubled financial firms and their major shareholders are required to rescue themselves first and to take all necessary steps to clean up debt and recover losses before seeking external help.

WHY DOES CHINA NEED THE FUND NOW?

The setting up of the fund aligns China with international practices. Major developed economies including the U.S. and the European Union have similar funds to provide capital support to troubled systemically important institutions.

China has already set up deposit insurance, an insurance guarantee fund and a trust guarantee fund, but scale of these funds is not enough to deal with systemic financial risks.

The rescue of troubled small regional lender Baoshang Bank in 2019 used more than half of the deposit insurance fund, which had a balance of 121.6 billion yuan as of the end of 2019.

China's financial system currently faces multiple challenges stemming from an ongoing property crisis and a sluggish economic recovery. Small and medium-sized banks have emerged as a vulnerable part of the financial industry.

China's financial stability is also threatened by the $9 trillion debt amassed by local government financing vehicles (LGFVs), platforms created to fund local government projects.

This debt burden poses potential contagion risks, as a wide range of financial institutions including regional banks and trust companies have high exposure to LGFVs.

How well France's hastily assembled anti-far-right front is working will become clear today, with candidates having until Tuesday evening to drop out of Sunday's crucial second-round vote to leave only those with the best chance of winning.

Following the anti-immigrant, eurosceptic National Rally's (RN) strong showing in the first round last weekend, the priority among its rivals is preventing Marine Le Pen's party from taking a majority.

That means fielding only the best-placed rival to the RN's candidate, irrespective of party - even if that candidate is from the equally divisive far-left France Unbowed (LFI) party.

Currently, the market's base case appears to be a hung parliament, although it would also risk political paralysis for the remainder of President Emmanuel Macron's tenure to 2027.

Stocks rallied, particularly in France where the jumped more than 1%. Some payback might be the immediate reaction on Tuesday morning, with pan-European futures pointing down about 0.1%.

The euro remains firm, even in the face of renewed dollar strength. Other greenback rivals are not proving so resilient, particularly the yen, which is still languishing close to a 38-year trough, keeping traders of high alert for another round of official Japanese intervention.

The dollar-yen pair is particularly sensitive to long-term U.S. yields, which have spiked amid the growing risk of a second Donald Trump presidency, which traders and analysts equate with higher tariffs and bigger spending.

The U.S. currency and yields are also elevated based on the idea that Federal Reserve policy isn't going to loosen at an accelerated pace, with inflation still pretty sticky and the job market quite tight.

A parade of potentially crucial employment data begins on Tuesday with the JOLTS job openings report, a Fed favourite, followed by ADP numbers a day later and the all-important monthly payrolls figures on Friday.

Fed Chair Jerome Powell has the opportunity to present his latest take on the economy when he participates in a panel at an ECB forum in Sintra, Portugal, later in the day.

The data calendar is fairly light for Europe, with euro-area flash inflation figures for June and the jobless rate for May.

Elsewhere, Big Tech may be wondering who's next in the European Commission's crosshairs, after Meta Platforms (NASDAQ: ) was charged with antitrust breaches on Monday.

Apple (NASDAQ: ) and Microsoft (NASDAQ: ) were both targets of the regulator last month over App Store rules and the bundling of Teams with the Office 365 suite, respectively.

The bill is being introduced as New Zealand media companies struggle against technology firms for advertising dollars, leading them to find new ways to provide news programming.

The Fair Digital News Bargaining Bill, introduced last year by the previous Labour government, will be presented in Parliament with amendments to support ""our local media companies to earn revenue for the news they produce"", Communications Minister Paul Goldsmith said.

The proposed changes would align it more closely with Australia's digital bargaining law, Goldsmith said.

That law, which took effect in Australia in March 2021, gives the government power to force internet firms such as Facebook owner Meta Platforms (NASDAQ: ) and Alphabet (NASDAQ: ) Inc's Google to negotiate content supply deals with media outlets, if the parties fail to reach an agreement on payments.

Meta said the New Zealand bill ignored the realities of how its platforms work, their voluntary nature, the preferences of users and the free value it provided news outlets.

""We will continue to be open and transparent with the government and publishers on our business decisions as this bill progresses,"" a Meta spokesperson said in an email.

Google did not immediately respond to a request seeking comment.

After Canada introduced a similar law in 2023, Meta blocked news content from appearing on Facebook there. Meta has also said it plans to stop paying Australian media companies for news and the government is still considering whether to intervene.

Goldsmith said the proposed changes would give power to the communications minister to decide which digital platforms would come under the law. An independent regulator will be appointed as the bill's authority, he said.

One of the governing coalition's partners, the right-wing ACT New Zealand party, will not support the bill, Goldsmith said, which means it must have the support of other parties to pass.

The opposition Labour party said it would check the amendments but supported the intent of the bill.

BERLIN (Reuters) - For months, Philip Matthias tried to convince his father to install solar panels on their company's roof in the eastern German state of Thuringia, aiming to cut electricity costs and carbon emissions at the metal products factory.

Initially sceptical of the 2.3-million-euro ($2.5 million) investment, a substantial sum for the medium-sized Tridelta, his father crunched the numbers and decided to nearly double the project capacity, opting to install photovoltaic modules that could power around 900 households in addition to the factory.

""The PV systems amortize after about 7-1/2 years. The manufacturer gives a guarantee of 20 years. That means this is an extremely lucrative investment,"" Matthias told Reuters.

Since the war in Ukraine and the sudden drop in Russia fossil fuel exports to Germany, Berlin has introduced laws to accelerate solar power expansion, part of its plan to cover 80% of the country's energy from renewables by 2030.

Encouraged by a feed-in tariff providing a guaranteed price to renewable energy producers selling their power, as well as reduced solar panel costs, German companies are increasingly turning to solar to get around high energy costs.

Although Germany has Europe's biggest capacity of solar and wind power generation, its small and medium-sized companies have yet to benefit from lower electricity prices because of high grid fees and taxes they must pay. By generating their own solar power, they avoid those fees and taxes.

Companies consumed around 69% of Germany's national electricity in 2023, data by the BDEW utilities association showed.

""As electricity prices in Germany show no signs of decreasing as previously anticipated, companies are increasingly recognising the economic viability of installing solar panels,"" said Marie-Theres Husken, an energy expert for the BVMW association for small- and medium-sized businesses.

CORPORATE SOLAR SHIFT

Newly installed photovoltaic capacity on business rooftops rose by 81% year-on-year in the first four months of the year, outpacing the 1% growth in the residential sector, data by the BSW solar power association shows.

A May survey by pollster YouGov showed more than half of German companies with suitable roofs planned to install solar power systems in the next three years. BVMW forecasts that nearly all manufacturing companies in Germany will use solar energy by 2030.

In response to increasing demand, Germany's largest residential solar power developer, Enpal, said in April it was expanding into the commercial sector.

""The demand was not as instant... but the growth is going to be very sustainable,"" Melchior Schulze Brock, CEO of commercial and industrial solar startup Enviria.

An April study by the Freiburg-based Institute for Applied Ecology showed there was potential to install up to 287 gigawatts (GW) of solar capacity, more than enough to meet Berlin's 2030 target of 215 GW, along German roads, railways, parking lots, and industrial areas. This could significantly reduce reliance on agricultural land where permitting and planning approvals can take up to a decade.

A drop in solar panel prices globally since last year has spurred companies to embrace solar energy.

""The market is overrun with cheap but good panels from China. That means that the system that we are building now is about 20% cheaper than a year ago,"" Matthias said.

A German legislative package passed in April easing regulation and increasing subsidies for large rooftop systems as well as a pending tax investment reform for real estate funds operating rooftop solar panels, is expected to drive demand further.

State feed-in subsidies for large scale rooftop photovoltaic projects, introduced in 2021 and which are selected via tender, have also boosted the trend.

The last tender for the subsidised projects in February saw a 107% rise in the number of offers year-on-year, data by the federal grid network agency showed.

A feed-in tariff of 9.3 euros cents per kilowatt-hour, higher than Tridelta's power purchasing price, makes it currently cheaper for the company to sell future generated electricity to the grid and buy it back, Matthias said.

Germany's economy ministry declined to comment on companies' electricity trading strategies.

""There's a high correlation between the feed-in tariffs and the build-up of solar PV roof top projects,"" Hugo Willink, Executive Director at solar roofs developer Sunrock told Reuters.

Sunrock, which won an order from Mercedes Benz (ETR: ) in May to build a 23-megawatt solar project on the carmaker's factory roofs, sees Germany as its core market for the coming year.

NEW DELHI (Reuters) - An Indian state government's inspection of a Som Group distillery said child labourers, some aged between 13 and 17, were made to fill and pack liquor bottles and worked long hours.

Police are investigating the use of child labour at the distillery in Madhya Pradesh state after the federal government's National Commission for Protection of Child Rights said last month it had found 58 children working illegally at the factory.

The commission released photos of some with hands showing chemical burns and said some children were transported in school buses for factory work.

A day after the children were found on June 15, an inspection report was drafted by the state's industrial health and safety department based on interviews with 27 workers, the youngest among them being 13 years old. The state says those aged under 21 cannot work in a liquor factory.

The report, which is not public but was seen by Reuters, says children were working 11-hour shifts starting at 8 a.m.

Som and the Madhya Pradesh government did not respond to Reuters' requests for comment.

In a submission to the state government on June 18, also seen by Reuters, Som said some children would visit the company to deliver food and medicines to their parents, and no worker was younger than 21.

Som is one of the smaller distilleries in India's thriving alcohol industry, where both foreign and domestic players operate. Its website describes it as an ""internationally acclaimed brand"" available in more than 20 markets including the United States, New Zealand and the United Kingdom.

The incident has drawn attention to child labour in Indian supply chains. In 2021, Reuters reported an external audit of two Carlsberg (CSE: ) warehouses found underage labourers at a location in the eastern state of Jharkhand. Carlsberg at the time said it had terminated the services of the third-party provider.

In the Som inspection report, the state government said the children working there were not given training on how they could protect themselves from harmful chemicals.

""Since it is hazardous work, there should have been a health centre at the factory,"" the report said.

The Madhya Pradesh government temporarily suspended the Som distillery's manufacturing licences, but the company has challenged the decision, saying there has been no conclusive finding of wrongdoing.

After Som's challenge, a local court put the state's decision on hold and said it would next hear the case later this month.

In a statement to the stock exchange last month, Som Distilleries and Breweries Ltd said the Madhya Pradesh plant was run by its ""associate private limited company"" and used labour supplied by contractors who may not have carried out proper age checks. The listed company's shares have fallen by 8% since the children were found at the factory.","Police are investigating the use of child labour at the distillery in Madhya Pradesh state after the federal government's National Commission for Protection of Child Rights said last month it had found 58 children working illegally at the factory.

(Reuters) -Hindenburg Research refuted allegations on Monday from India's securities regulator accusing the company of colluding with a U.S. asset manager to use non-public information to set up its short bet against Adani Group last year.

In a statement posted to its website, U.S.-based short-seller Hindenburg provided a copy of a 46-page show cause notice from the Securities and Exchange Board of India (SEBI) outlining the allegations that six entities including Hindenburg, asset manager Kingdon Capital Management and a Mauritus-based trading fund set up by Kotak Mahindra Bank violated certain rules under the Prevention of Fraud and Unfair Trade Practices regulation.

While SEBI has not made the notice public, two sources at the regulator with direct knowledge of the matter confirmed its authenticity.

The allegations, if proven, could result in monetary penalties and the payback of any illegal gains.

Hindenburg responded saying the notice is ""nonsense"" and an attempt to silence and intimidate by alleging that Hindenburg's report contained misrepresentations and inaccurate statements meant to mislead readers.

""In our view, SEBI has neglected its responsibility, seemingly doing more to protect those perpetrating fraud than to protect the investors being victimized by it,"" Hindenburg said.

The disclosure of the SEBI notice adds a new twist in the saga that began last year when Hindenburg, founded by Nathan Anderson, alleged improper business dealings by Adani.

Adani, which refuted the allegations, suffered a loss of as much as $150 billion in combined market value after the report, but has since rebounded.

In the notice, SEBI alleges Hindenburg colluded with its client Kingdon Capital Management by providing a draft of its report on Adani Group before it was released publicly.

SEBI alleges that Mark Kingdon, the owner of Kingdon Capital, then set up a fund able to trade Indian equities known as K Indian Opportunities Fund. That fund created short positions in Adani group stocks between Jan. 10, 2023, and Jan. 20, 2023, five days ahead of the Hindenburg report being published, according to the SEBI documents.

In its statement, Hindenburg said a Mauritius registered unit of Kotak Mahindra Bank, an Indian firm, created and oversaw an offshore fund structure that was used by its ""investor partner"" to bet against Adani's shares.

The positions were squared off in February, leading to gains of $22.25 million, the SEBI documents said.

Hindenburg in its statement does not comment on its relationship with Kingdon.

An email to Hindenburg Research and Kingdon Capital was not immediately answered.

SEBI has not replied to a request for comment on Hindenburg's statement and to confirm the authenticity of the show cause order.

Kotak did not reply to a request for comment.

Hindenburg's response sheds some light on the mechanics of its Adani short trade, the details of which intrigued other investors because Indian securities rules make it hard for foreigners to bet against companies there.

Hindenburg said it made $4.1 million in gross revenue through ""gains related to Adani shorts from that investor relationship"" and just $31,000 through its short position of Adani's U.S. bonds. It did not name the investor.

""It was a tiny position,"" it said. ""But, to date, our research on Adani is by far the work we are most proud of.""","The disclosure of the SEBI notice adds a new twist in the saga that began last year when Hindenburg, founded by Nathan Anderson, alleged improper business dealings by Adani.

TOKYO (Reuters) -Four of Japan's top property and casualty insurers and other financial firms plan to sell around 500 billion yen ($3.1 billion) of shares in Honda (NYSE: ) Motor , three people said, as the unwinding of cross-shareholding practices accelerates.

Tokio Marine Holdings Sompo Holdings and two units of MS&AD Insurance Group (T: ) will together offload shares in the automaker, said the people, who declined to be identified because the information has not been made public.

Other financial institutions will also pare back their Honda stakes, bringing the total sale to around 500 billion yen based on Honda's current share price, the sources said.

Honda is set to soon formally give the insurers the go-ahead to sell its shares, the sources said.

The automaker has already announced plans to buy back up to 300 billion yen of its shares during the current financial year, a move seen as helping absorb some of the impact from the sale.

Honda declined to comment on the insurers' sale, saying only that the information was not something it itself had announced.

Spokespeople for Tokio Marine and MS&AD declined to comment. Sompo did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

The four firms, which include MS&AD units Mitsui Sumitomo Insurance and Aioi Nissay Dowa Insurance, have previously said they would bring all cross shareholding arrangements to zero.

Honda is one of the top five cross-shareholding companies for the insurers except for Aioi Nissay Dowa Insurance, according to securities filings as of March.

The sale of shares of a high-profile company, in which the insurers have notable stakes, is the latest sign that the unwinding of cross-shareholding is gaining pace in Japan.

Cross-shareholding, or companies holding shares in each other, was long seen as a way to cement business ties. However, governance experts and foreign investors have said it protects management from shareholders, leading to lax governance.

The four insurers, or their parents, held more than 300 billion yen of Honda shares as of March, with Tokio Marine at 161 billion yen, Sompo Japan at 81 billion, Mitsui Sumitomo at 73 billion and Aioi Nissay at 2.8 billion, securities filings showed.

In total, the four held some 9 trillion yen worth of cross shareholdings as of March, with Toyota Motor (NYSE: ), Shin-etsu Chemical and Itochu among the top names, the filings showed.

In December, the four insurers were handed a business improvement order by Japan's Financial Services Agency after they were found to have fixed the prices of their corporate insurance fees. The regulator told them to reduce their cross-shareholdings.

Shares of Honda turned negative in late trade on Tuesday following the report. Shares were down 1.7% at 1,727 yen, after earlier rising as high as 1,801 yen.

PARIS (Reuters) -Airbus delivered a preliminary total of around 67 airplanes in June, bringing the total for the first half of the year to around 323 aircraft, up 2% from the same period last year, industry sources said on Monday.

Airbus, which last week cut its delivery forecast for the full year to 770 planes from 800 amid supply chain concerns, declined to comment ahead of the release of monthly and half-yearly data expected on July 8.

On a quarterly basis, the preliminary figure implies a 4% drop since the second quarter of last year.

Underscoring trends which prompted Airbus to cut targets last week, the June total also falls short of the company's original ambitions for the month by about 10 aircraft, on top of single-digit shortfalls in prior months, suppliers said.

Airbus cited shortages of engines, structural parts and interiors for last week's decision to lower its delivery target, which came after Reuters reported a new wave of output delays in late May, driven by parts shortages.

Airbus last week slowed plans to raise output of its best-selling A320neo family, by delaying the date at which it expects to reach a record production speed of 75 jets a month to 2027 from 2026. That compares with an estimated 50 jets a month now.

Based on tracking data, Jefferies analyst Chloe Lemarie also estimated Airbus delivered 67 jets in June, putting it on course for what she described as a weak second quarter in the core commercial business, with headwinds including higher headcount and lower volume compared with the second quarter of last year.

Bernstein analyst Douglas Harned wrote that he expected a more modest ramp-up in deliveries in the future, and lowered his 2025 delivery forecast to 870 aircraft from 915.","By Tim HepherPARIS (Reuters) -Airbus delivered a preliminary total of around 67 airplanes in June, bringing the total for the first half of the year to around 323 aircraft, up 2% from the same period last year, industry sources said on Monday.

(Reuters) -Australian lender ANZ has been sanctioned for failing to stop or refund fees for dead customers and not responding to their representatives within a required time frame, a committee that looks at the banking industry's practices said on Tuesday.

The Banking Code Compliance Committee, a self-regulation body, had in June 2023 come out with its ""Deceased Estates Report"", which looks at how banks in Australia had complied with the required obligations. The BCCC had then began an investigation into three lenders, including ANZ Group.

The practice of continuing to charge fees from dead customers prominently featured during the Hayne Royal Commission, which was established in December 2017 by the Australian government.

""The decision to name ANZ for its non-compliance reflects the seriousness of its code breaches,"" BCCC chair Ian Govey AM said in a statement on Tuesday.

""Naming a bank is a sanction that we reserve for the most serious and systemic breaches.""

ANZ acknowledged the findings of the report in an emailed response, adding that the lender has ""significantly"" improved the time it takes to provide information around a customer's accounts to their representatives.

ANZ has also already established a dedicated program to improve the experience for dead customers' representatives and has changed a number of processes and technology to manage these cases, it said.

Despite initially identifying the issues in early 2022, ANZ took over a year to implement solutions and then nearly 2 years to begin the customer remediation program.

The remediation program is still ongoing and expected to be finalised by July-end.

The lender should have done more to urgently remediate the affected customers, Govey said, adding, the remediation did not meet expectations.

ANZ will pay around A$3.3 million ($2.19 million) in remediation to 18,852 impacted customers, the committee said in its investigation report.

BYD sold 426,039 EVs in the April-June quarter, according to Reuters' calculations based on its monthly sales reports. That's around 12,000 vehicles fewer than Tesla's vehicle deliveries estimated for the second quarter.

Tesla is expected to report a 6% drop in April-June quarter vehicle deliveries on Tuesday, the first time the U.S. firm is set to post two straight quarters of decline, as it deals with stiff competition in China and slow demand due to a lack of affordable new models.

The company may again cede its EV championship to BYD if the actual results turn out to be softer than estimated, with Barclays predicting an 11% drop in second-quarter deliveries, Tesla's biggest ever.

Tesla has hit a speed bump after years of rapid growth that helped make it the world's most valuable automaker. It warned in January that deliveries growth in 2024 would be ""notably lower"" as a boost from months-long price cuts wanes.

The EV maker has cut output of its best-selling Model Y electric car by a double-digit percentage number at its Shanghai plant since March to address weakening demand for its aged models in China, its second-largest market after the United States, Reuters reported in May.

By comparison, its top Chinese competitor BYD maintained steady growth in EV sales, while EV upstarts such as Nio (NYSE: ) reported stellar growth last quarter. NIO's vehicle deliveries in the second quarter more than doubled to 57,300 units.

Price cuts and a growing shift in consumer demand to EVs and hybrids from gasoline-powered vehicles are the main reasons behind Chinese EV makers' strong sales in recent months, said Cui Dongshu, secretary general, China Passenger Car Association (CPCA).

BRUSSELS (Reuters) -Nvidia is set to be charged by the French antitrust regulator for allegedly anti-competitive practices, people with direct knowledge of the matter said, making it the first enforcer to act against the computer chip maker.

The French so-called statement of objections or charge sheet would follow dawn raids in the graphics cards sector in September last year, which sources said targeted Nvidia (NASDAQ: ). The raids were the result of a broader inquiry into cloud computing.

The world's largest maker of chips used both for artificial intelligence and for computer graphics has seen demand for its chips jump following the release of the generative AI application ChatGPT, triggering regulatory scrutiny on both sides of the Atlantic.

The French authority, which publishes some but not all its statements of objections to companies, and Nvidia declined comment. The company in a regulatory filing last year said regulators in the European Union, China and France had asked for information on its graphic cards.

The European Commission is unlikely to expand its preliminary review for now, since the French authority is looking into Nvidia, other people with direct knowledge of the matter said.

The French watchdog in a report issued last Friday on competition in generative AI cited the risk of abuse by chip providers.

It voiced concerns regarding the sector's dependence on Nvidia's CUDA chip programming software, the only system that is 100% compatible with the GPUs that have become essential for accelerated computing.

It also cited unease about Nvidia’s recent investments in AI-focused cloud service providers such as CoreWeave.

Companies risk fines of as much as 10% of their global annual turnover for breaching French antitrust rules, although they can also provide concessions to stave off penalties.

The Commerce Department's Census Bureau said on Monday that construction spending dipped 0.1% after an upwardly revised 0.3% increase in April. Economists polled by Reuters had forecast construction spending rebounding 0.2% after a previously reported 0.1% fall in April.

Construction spending increased 6.4% year-on-year in May.

Spending on private construction projects slipped 0.3% in May after rising 0.4% in the prior month. Investment in residential construction dropped 0.2% after surging 0.9% in April. Outlays on new single-family construction projects decreased 0.7%. Spending on multi-family housing was unchanged.

Mortgage rates shot up in May, hurting homebuilder confidence, homebuilding and home sales.

Housing supply has improved considerably as the higher borrowing costs stifle demand, which could limit growth in new construction. The inventory of previously owned homes in May was the largest since August 2022, while new housing supply was the highest in more than 16 years.

Residential investment is expected to have slowed sharply in the second quarter after logging double-digit growth in the January-March quarter.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. manufacturing contracted for a third straight month in June as demand remained subdued, while a drop in a measure of prices paid by factories for inputs to a six-month low suggested that inflation could continue to subside.

The weakness at the end of the second quarter reported by the Institute for Supply Management on Monday was across the board, with ISM Manufacturing Business Survey Committee Chair Timothy Fiore describing manufacturers as demonstrating ""an unwillingness to invest in capital and inventory due to current monetary policy and other conditions.""

Manufacturing is being pressured by higher interest rates and softening demand for goods, though business investment has largely held up.

""We expect the manufacturing sector to remain weak over the next couple of quarters,"" said Oliver Allen, senior U.S. economist at Pantheon Macroeconomics. ""The retreat in corporate bond yields since late last year ... seems to have provided some support to investment spending, but not enough to get manufacturing growing again. A much more significant loosening in financial conditions is required to change that.""

The ISM's manufacturing PMI slipped to 48.5 last month from 48.7 in May. A PMI reading above 50 indicates growth in the manufacturing sector, which accounts for 10.3% of the economy. The PMI remains above the 42.5 level, which the ISM says over a period of time indicates an expansion of the overall economy.

Economists polled by Reuters had forecast the PMI climbing to 49.1. It has indicated contraction in manufacturing in 19 of the last 20 months. Sixty-two percent of manufacturing gross domestic product contracted, up from 55% in May.

The share of sector GDP registering a composite PMI at or below 45 — a good barometer of overall manufacturing weakness — jumped to 14% from 4% in the prior month.

Eight manufacturing industries, including primary metals and chemical products, reported growth. Machinery, transportation equipment, electrical equipment, appliances and components as well as computer and electronic products were among the nine industries that contracted.

Commentary from manufacturers was mostly downbeat. Makers of chemical products reported a ""high volume of customer orders."" Transportation equipment manufacturers, however, complained that ""customers continue to cut orders with short notice, causing a ripple effect throughout lower-tier suppliers.""

Makers of electrical equipment, appliances and components reported that ""customers (were) ordering more to create buffer stocks, in case of future shortages. Manufacturers of fabricated metal products mentioned signs of weak demand, adding ""we must work to reduce inventory levels.""

Machinery manufacturers said ""sales backlog is decreasing,"" and that they had ""furloughed a portion of our workforce as a result."" Makers of miscellaneous manufactured goods reported that the ""level of production is lower due to decreased demand for products.""

Stocks on Wall Street were trading higher. The dollar was little changed against a basket of currencies. U.S. Treasury prices fell.

WEAK ORDERS

Government data last week showed manufacturing contracted at a 4.3% annualized rate in the first quarter, with most of the decline coming from long-lasting manufactured goods.

The Federal Reserve has maintained its benchmark overnight interest rate in the current 5.25%-5.50% range since last July. Financial markets expect the U.S. central bank to start its easing cycle in September, though policymakers recently adopted a more hawkish outlook. The Fed has hiked its policy rate by 525 basis points since 2022 to quell inflation.

The ISM survey's forward-looking new orders sub-index rose to a still-subdued 49.3 reading from 45.4 in May. Output at factories decreased for the first time since February. The production sub-index fell to 48.5 from 50.2 in May.

Inflation at the factory gate was much cooler. The survey's measure of prices paid by manufacturers dropped to 52.1, the lowest reading since December, from 57.0 in May.

Declining goods prices accounted for much of the unchanged reading in monthly inflation in May, and the decrease in input prices last month bodes well for the continued disinflationary trend in the broader economy.

That was reinforced by the fourth straight month of faster delivery performance of suppliers to manufacturers.

""The improvement in supply chains ought to be viewed favorably by the Fed in terms of rebalancing demand for and supply of goods,"" said Conrad DeQuadros, senior economic advisor at Brean Capital.

Factory employment slipped after briefly rebounding in May amid layoffs, attrition and hiring freezes.

The overall labor market is gradually cooling. The government is likely to report on Friday that nonfarm payrolls increased by 190,000 jobs in June after surging 272,000 in May, according to a Reuters survey of economists. The unemployment rate is forecast unchanged at 4.0%.

Higher borrowing costs are also chipping away at growth in the construction sector, which had been boosted by demand for new homes amid a shortage of previously owned houses for sale.

A separate report from the Commerce Department's Census Bureau on Monday showed construction spending dipped 0.1% in May after an upwardly revised 0.3% increase in April. Economists had forecast construction spending rebounding 0.2% after a previously reported 0.1% fall in April.

Investment in residential construction dropped 0.2% after surging 0.9% in April. While mortgage rates have retreated from May's lofty levels, housing supply has improved considerably as demand slackened, which could limit growth in new construction.

""The perpetuation of high-for-long interest rate policy boosted the benchmark 30-year fixed mortgage rate back above 7% this spring, and demand for housing appears to have softened in response across a range of measures,"" said Michael Hanson, an economist at JPMorgan. ""We see a likely pullback in residential construction during the second half of this year.""","Manufacturing is being pressured by higher interest rates and softening demand for goods, though business investment has largely held up.
""We expect the manufacturing sector to remain weak over the next couple of quarters,"" said Oliver Allen, senior U.S. economist at Pantheon Macroeconomics.
The ISM's manufacturing PMI slipped to 48.5 last month from 48.7 in May.

Inflation eased to 2.5% in June, preliminary data from the federal statistics office showed on Monday.

Analysts polled by Reuters had forecast a reading of 2.6%, after a year-on-year increase in consumer prices of 2.8% in May, based on data harmonised to compare with other European Union countries.

In March, inflation in Europe's largest economy slackened to 2.3%, its lowest level since June 2021.

LONDON/TOKYO (Reuters) -Manufacturing activity in Europe suffered a setback last month but Asian factories enjoyed solid momentum, offering policymakers some hope the region can weather the hit from soft Chinese demand, surveys showed.

The downturn in Europe was widespread, with Italy the only big player not to see a fall in its Purchasing Managers' Index (PMI) despite manufacturers largely cutting prices.

HCOB's final euro zone manufacturing PMI, compiled by S&P Global, fell to 45.8 in June from May's 47.3. It has been below the 50 mark separating growth from contraction for two years.

Germany's factory sector, which accounts for about a fifth of Europe's biggest economy, experienced a retreat, while in France the manufacturing recession deepened.

France's far-right National Rally party scored an historic win in parliamentary elections on Sunday, stoking risks of a crisis in the euro area even as other political parties rushed to build a united front to block its path to power.

In Britain, which holds a national election on Thursday, manufacturing growth slipped in June from May's 22-month high as ongoing disruption to shipping in the Red Sea led to lower demand from overseas customers.

A new orders index in the currency union dropped to 44.4 from 47.3, despite factories cutting prices charged for a fourteenth month.

WEAK YEN BOOSTS IMPORT COSTS

But cost pressures weighed on manufacturers in countries like Japan, where a weak yen is boosting the price companies pay for fuel and raw material imports.

China's Caixin/S&P Global manufacturing PMI rose to 51.8 in June from 51.7. It marked the fastest clip in more than three years and exceeded market forecasts of 51.2.

The private-sector reading followed official PMI data on Sunday showing China's manufacturing activity fell for a second month in June and services activity slid to a five-month low.

The surveys demonstrate how Chinese firms are ramping up production despite weak domestic demand, which Beijing has failed to reverse with a rescue package for an ailing property sector.

In a sign Asia is benefiting from solid global demand, South Korea's factory activity growth quickened in June to the fastest in 26 months on surging new orders, its PMI showed.

Factory activity also expanded in June at a faster pace than in May in Vietnam and Taiwan, other surveys showed.

BERLIN (Reuters) - The downturn in Germany's manufacturing sector, which accounts for about a fifth of Europe's biggest economy, experienced a fresh setback in June as output and new orders declined at a faster pace, a survey showed on Monday.

The HCOB final Purchasing Managers' Index (PMI) for German manufacturing fell to 43.5 in June from 45.4 in May, confirming a preliminary flash estimate and remaining below the 50 level that separates growth from contraction.

""The accelerated fall in new orders and especially export orders indicates that we will have to wait some more months until a recovery in the manufacturing sector can be seen,"" said Cyrus de la Rubia, chief economist at Hamburg Commercial Bank.

One likely explanation for the weak exports orders is increasing competition from China, which is ramping up its exports worldwide due to sluggish domestic demand, he added.

TOKYO (Reuters) -Japan downgraded first-quarter gross domestic product (GDP) on Monday and the service-sector business mood soured in June on concerns over rising costs, offseting a lift in factory confidence and pointing to weakness in consumption.

But the ""tankan"" quarterly survey showed firms planned to ramp up capital expenditure and projected inflation to stay around the Bank of Japan's target of 2% in coming years, keeping alive market expectations of a near-term interest rate hike.

The findings, which come ahead of the BOJ's next policy meeting on July 30 and 31, complicate its decision on how soon to raise interest rates, analysts say.

""The improvement in business sentiment may have peaked, particularly for non-manufacturers. This data doesn't necessarily help the BOJ make the case for an early rate hike,"" said Toru Suehiro, chief economist at Daiwa Securities.

""But corporate inflation expectations heightened slightly, which will likely keep alive market expectations for a near-term rate hike.""

A rare unscheduled downgrade to Japan's historical gross domestic product (GDP) data showed the economy shrank more than reported in the first quarter, which will probably force the BOJ to cut its growth forecasts this month.

Separately, the BOJ's tankan showed service-sector firms were less optimistic in June than three months ago, suggesting a tight job market and soft consumption were hurting sentiment.

An index of big non-manufacturers' sentiment fell to +33 in June from +34 in March, matching market forecasts and worsening for the first time in two years.

By contrast, the headline index measuring big manufacturers' mood rose to +13 in June from +11 in March, exceeding a median market forecast for a reading of +12.

The reading, the highest since March 2022, reflected a rebound in auto output and manufacturers' success in passing on rising costs of raw material through price hikes.

Big firms plan to increase capital expenditure by 11.1% in the current fiscal year ending in March 2025, after a gain of 10.6% in the previous year, the tankan showed.

In a sign of rising inflationary pressure, an index of output prices rose for both manufacturers and non-manufacturers, the survey showed.

Long-term corporate inflation expectations also heightened slightly, with companies projecting inflation to hit 2.3% three years from now and 2.2% five years ahead, the tankan showed.

""Corporate inflation expectations seem anchored at 2%,"" said Ko Nakayama, chief economist at Okasan Securities. ""The tankan is a tailwind for the BOJ in normalising monetary policy.""

The Monday up 0.12%, having pared gains after the tankan on expectations that rising inflation prospects will prompt the BOJ to raise rates soon.

GDP MAY AFFECT BOJ RATE HIKE TIMING

The BOJ ended negative interest rates in March on the view that sustained achievement of its 2% inflation target has come into sight. Governor Kazuo Ueda has signaled the chance of more hikes if underlying inflation heads toward 2%, as it projects.

Many market players expect the BOJ to raise rates again this year with some betting on the chance of action in July. Others, however, see hurdles for the BOJ to act so soon.

A revision to historical data showed Japan's GDP shrank an annualised 2.9% in January-March, down from an earlier estimate of a 1.8% contraction, reflecting corrections in past data on construction orders.

The GDP for last year's third and fourth quarters was also revised down.

The revisions, which came on top of recent weak consumption and output data, are likely to affect the BOJ's quarterly growth and price forecasts due at its July 30-31 policy meeting.

Yoshiki Shinke, an economist at Dai-ichi Life Research Institute, expects the GDP revisions to lead to a significant downgrade in this fiscal year's growth forecast.

""I wonder if the BOJ can manage to trim bond buying and hike rates simultaneously in July, when there's a growth downgrade showing the economy was in worse shape than thought,"" he said.","""But corporate inflation expectations heightened slightly, which will likely keep alive market expectations for a near-term rate hike.""

Your Voice, Your Vote is not a scientific project, but it does allow you to have your say. These topics are far from the most common in your responses, but carry great strength of feeling. Diane from Worcestershire says litter and fly-tipping are at ""epidemic levels"" while Christine, 33, from Surrey is shocked by ""the sheer amount of rubbish everywhere"". Martin, 42, from Perthshire asks: ""What are the parties going to do to enforce the law and what new initiatives will be taken to improve this worrying situation? It appears no parties are interested.""

The Conservatives do have a sentence in their manifesto with a proposal to make fly-tipping an offence which would carry a sanction of penalty points on a driving licence. When it spelled out this policy earlier in the campaign, opposition parties responded with claims that cases had been high but resulted in a low proportion of fines. Labour says fly-tippers will be forced to clean up their mess. There may be good reason why litter and fly-tipping are rarely mentioned. Local councils are primarily responsible for this area of policy, so they were more dominant during local elections earlier in the year.

Shoplifting

Although surveys give slightly differing figures on shoplifting, cases are at, or near, the highest level seen for 20 years. The BBC has reported on vulnerable women and children being trafficked to the UK to shoplift for Eastern European crime groups. Retail worker Allan wrote to say he faced shoplifting and threatening behaviour on a daily basis.

Amanda in Bristol says shoplifting has become ""normalised"", but there are contrasting views on the best way to tackle such a crime. The parties do devote whole chapters of their manifestos to how they would deal with crime. However, there is little mention of shoplifting in particular, although Labour plans to introduce a specific offence of assaults on shopworkers.

Assisted dying

Scotland, Jersey and the Isle of Man are all considering changing the law to let terminally ill people end their lives. Campaigner Dame Esther Rantzen wants Westminster MPs to vote on assisted dying too, while Liz Carr, a comedian, actress and disability rights campaigner, has been a vocal opponent. Views on both sides of the debate are clear from your comments. Lynne from Kent and Anne from Lancashire both ask whether the parties would put legalisation of assisted dying to a referendum, while Oliver, aged 29, from Bedfordshire says it is ""an important social issue"" which has not had an airing in this campaign. However, John from Devon says it would be ""nonsense"" to allow assisted dying in any form. Only the Greens suggest in their manifesto that a change in the law is needed. The Conservatives describe it as a ""matter of conscience"" - both they, and the Liberal Democrats, say it should go to a free vote in Parliament.

Income tax thresholds

""The main issue I'd like to see the parties wake up to is personal tax thresholds,"" says Elizabeth, aged 44, from Cambridgeshire. ""Keeping these frozen until 2028 is crippling hard working families and it’s just not fair or right."" Not everyone agrees with Elizabeth, with some people pointing out that tax rises would be necessary to improve essential public services. Tax thresholds mark the level of income at which different rates of income tax are paid. They have been frozen, when they would normally be expected to rise in line with prices.

This issue has been raised regularly during debates, interviews and in commentary, such as this piece by the BBC's economics editor, Faisal Islam, but less so in manifestos. Labour, the Liberal Democrats and the Conservatives will all keep the freeze for the next three years. Reform and the Workers Party of Britain say they would raise the starting income tax threshold to £20,000 and £21,200 respectively, although questions have been raised over how this would be funded. Tax bands differ in Scotland, and the SNP says it wants full devolution of tax powers.

Hunting

Toni from Devon is among those saying: ""The ban on hunting needs to be strengthened."" Fox-hunting has been a major issue in previous election campaigns, before and after it was banned in England and Wales by the Labour government in 2004. There is different legislation in Scotland, and it is still permitted in Northern Ireland.

Labour and the Greens say they would ban trail hunting, which sees hounds and riders follow a pre-laid scent along an agreed route. The Conservatives and Labour want to ban the import of hunting trophies.

The free, ad-supported service will compete with the likes of Netflix and Disney+

Rupert Murdoch's Fox Corporation is entering the UK's highly competitive free, ad-supported video streaming market.

Tubi will compete with the likes of Netflix, Disney+, ITVX and Channel 4's streaming platform as well as the BBC iPlayer.

The platform has been quickly gaining market share in the US where, according to Fox, it has almost 80 million monthly active users.

In the UK, Tubi says it will offer more than 20,000 films and TV series, including content from Disney, Lionsgate, NBCUniversal and Sony Pictures Entertainment.

The platform will also include a selection of British, Indian and Nigerian content.

UK viewers will be able to access content on the Tubi webpage and via a smartphone app.

“Tubi has spent the last decade honing our approach to vast, free and fun streaming in North America, and we feel that now is the perfect time to bring that recipe to UK audiences,” Tubi chief executive Anjali Sud said.

Fox Corporation bought Tubi in 2020 for $440m (£348m) as the US media giant looked to attract younger audiences.

In recent years, streaming companies like Netflix, Amazon Prime Video and Disney+ have launched ad-supported services and raised subscription prices as they tried to boost revenues.

The moves came as they faced pressure to spend more money to grow their libraries of content as they try to attract more customers in an increasingly competitive market.

In March, Mr Murdoch's TalkTV network announced that it would stop broadcasting as a terrestrial television channel and became a strictly online service.

The network launched in 2022 but struggled to attract viewers on its linear platform.

Mr Murdoch had hoped the network would shake up the broadcasting establishment by offering an opinion-led alternative to established outlets.

The media tycoon played a pivotal role in the development of the UK's broadcasting industry by launching Sky in 1984.

Some commentators saw TalkTV as an attempt by Mr Murdoch to recreate his success with Sky.

Mr Murdoch's 21st Century Fox sold its 39% stake in Sky to NBCUniversal's owner Comcast in 2018 after losing a bidding battle for the network.","Murdoch's Fox to launch free Netflix rival in UKThe free, ad-supported service will compete with the likes of Netflix and Disney+Rupert Murdoch's Fox Corporation is entering the UK's highly competitive free, ad-supported video streaming market.

55 minutes ago By Simon Jack and Faarea Masud , BBC Business Share

The Unite union has called off a strike planned for 8 July so further talks can take place over the future of the UK’s largest steel works at Port Talbot in Wales. Owners Tata had threatened to bring forward the planned closure of both remaining blast furnaces the day before the strike, citing safety fears due to a staff walkout. Unite’s strike action was called to the dismay of other unions who feared that it would accelerate the closure of blast furnace number four, which was not due to be shut down until September. The Community and GMB unions had hoped that would give them time for more negotiations to extend the life of the remaining furnace with a potentially new government in place.

Unite general secretary Sharon Graham said the talks were ""essential"". ""Workers were simply not prepared to stand idly by while steel making ended and their communities were laid to waste,"" she said, saying the focus should be on fresh investment and the continuation of long-term steel making in the region.

On Thursday Tata said it would close both furnaces within days unless it could ""safely and stably operate"" them during the strike. Then it wrote to all three unions, offering to begin new talks if the strike was called off. The firm says the talks will not renegotiate the existing plan but will focus on future investment opportunities.

'Serious mistake'

Several months of talks with unions commenced after Tata said it planned to radically transform its south Wales operations to deal with financial losses and to reduce its carbon emissions. The government has already promised the firm a £500m grant towards the development of a new £1.25bn electric arc furnace which recycles scrap metal, is less energy intensive, but requires far fewer staff. Tata said the move would secure the future of steel making at the site. The Community steel union has called Tata's decision ""a serious mistake”. After the company rejected union plans to keep one blast furnace running at the site in April, Community's Roy Rickhaus said at the time: ""We do not accept the company's assertion our plan was too expensive - in fact, it would have returned the company to profits.""

The closure of both furnaces at Port Talbot would cost 2,800 jobs. But extending the life of one of them would save 2,000 of those jobs if the remaining blast furnace was left on until the new electric arc furnace has been built on the site, which could take up to three years. Sources close to the matter told the BBC that Unite had given Tata the perfect excuse to shut down early, accelerating job losses. But Unite officials rejected that, saying their action “helped focus minds”, and are claiming a victory of sorts over the news that further talks will take place after the election. However, in a letter to unions from Tata - seen by the BBC - it is clear the company had already agreed to further talks after the upcoming election.

High mortgage rates mean affordability is still ""stretched"" for many home buyers, according to the Nationwide. The building society said that while earnings had been rising faster than house prices in recent years, this had not been enough to offset the impact of more expensive mortgages. Its comments came as it said house price growth had been ""broadly stable"" in June, with prices up 0.2% from the previous month. The average house price is now £266,064, the lender said.

Prices were up 1.5% from a year earlier, but Nationwide said activity in the housing market had been ""broadly flat"" over the past 12 months, with transactions down by about 15% compared with 2019. The lender said the market was still being affected by the increase in mortgage rates, which started climbing after the Bank of England began to raise its key interest rate in late 2021. Robert Gardner, Nationwide's chief economist, said that mortgage rates are ""still well above the record lows prevailing in 2021 in the wake of the pandemic"". ""For example, the interest rate on a five-year fixed rate mortgage for a borrower with a 25% deposit was 1.3% in late 2021, but in recent months this has been nearer to 4.7%. ""As a result, housing affordability is still stretched."" Nationwide's figures are based on the building society's own mortgage lending, which does not include buyers who purchase homes with cash, or buy-to-let deals. Cash buyers account for about a third of housing sales. The impact of higher borrowing costs can be seen in the fact that transactions involving a mortgage are down by nearly 25% over the past year, Nationwide said. Meanwhile the number of cash transactions for properties is about 5% higher than pre-pandemic levels. Across the UK, Northern Ireland saw the biggest price increases, up 4.1% from a year earlier. Wales and Scotland both saw a 1.4% annual rise. Prices in England climbed by 0.6%, with northern regions seeing bigger increases in general than the south.

Despite some major lenders cutting their mortgage rates last week, home loan costs remain far higher than pre-pandemic levels. According to financial information service Moneyfacts, the average rate on a two-year fixed mortgage deal stands at 5.95%, while for a five-year deal the average is 5.53%. The focus is now on the Bank of England's Monetary Policy Committee (MPC), which sets interest rates, to see if it decides to cut at its next meeting on 1 August. June's MPC meeting saw a change in tone from policymakers, with suggestions that the Bank could vote for a rate cut next month. ""Buyers may find their mojo again when we get a rate cut from the Bank of England,"" said Sarah Coles, head of personal finance at Hargreaves Lansdown. ""This could come as early as August, although sticky services inflation and higher wages could mean we need to wait until the autumn. ""Either way, we’re not expecting massive overnight drops in mortgage rates, so the reaction is more likely to be a muted upturn in sentiment than an overwhelming wave of optimism.""

Last week, the Bank said that about three million households are set to see their mortgage payments rise in the next two years. These are homeowners who arranged mortgage deals before the Bank started to lift rates in 2021. These deals are now expiring, and the Bank said the majority will finish before the end of 2026. For the typical household looking for a new deal, monthly mortgage repayments are forecast to increase by about £180, or about 28%, the Bank said. However, for around 400,000 households, monthly payments could jump by 50% or more. Bank of England figures released on Monday showed a small fall in the number of mortgages approved in May, down to 60,000 from 60,800 in April. However, the data also showed the amount borrowed through mortgages dropped sharply to £1.2bn in May, from £2.2bn the month before, although this does not include those remortgaging with the same lender.

surf Mission accomplished for Edwin Verheul (left) and Joachim Opdenakker

In February, deep inside a warehouse at Cern, the Swiss home of the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) – the world’s biggest science experiment – two network engineers held their breath. And pressed a button. Suddenly, text on a black background flashed up on a screen in front of them. It had worked. “There was high-fiving involved,” recalls Joachim Opdenakker at SURF, a Dutch IT association that works for educational and research institutions. “It was super-cool to see.” He and his colleague Edwin Verheul had just set up a new data link between the LHC in Switzerland and data storage sites in The Netherlands. A data link that could reach speeds of 800 gigabits per second (Gbps) – or more than 11,000 times the average UK home broadband speed. The idea is to improve scientists’ access to the results of LHC experiments. A subsequent test in March using special equipment on loan from Nokia proved the desired speeds were achievable. “This transponder that Nokia uses, it’s like a celebrity,” says Mr Verheul, explaining how the kit is booked up for use at various locations in advance. “We had limited time to do tests. If you have to postpone a week, then the transponder is gone.” This amount of bandwidth, approaching one terabit per second, is extremely fast but some subsea cables are a few hundred times faster still – they use multiple fibre strands to achieve such speeds.

Nokia & Surf After its upgrade the Large Hadron Collider will produce five times as much data

In labs around the world, networking experts are coming up with fibre optic systems capable of pushing data around even more rapidly than this. They are reaching extraordinary speeds of many petabits per second (Pbps), or 300 million times the average UK home broadband connection. This is so fast that one can barely imagine how people will use such bandwidth in the future. But engineers are wasting no time in proving that it is possible. And they only want to go faster. The duplex cable (with cores that either send or receive) from Cern to data centres in The Netherlands is just shy of 1,650km (I,025 miles) long, snaking from Geneva to Paris, then Brussels, and finally Amsterdam. Part of the challenge in reaching 800 Gbps was in beaming pulses of light such a long way. “Due to the distance, the power levels of that light decrease, so you have to amplify it at different locations,” explains Mr Opdenakker. Every time one tiny subatomic particle smashes into another during experiments at the LHC, the impact generates staggering volumes of data – about one petabyte per second. That’s enough to fill 220,000 DVDs. This is slimmed down for storage and study, but still requires hefty amounts of bandwidth. Plus, with an upgrade due by 2029, the LHC expects to produce even more scientific data than it does today. “The upgrade increases the number of collisions by at least a factor of five,” says James Watt, senior vice president and general manager of optical networks at Nokia.

A time when 800 Gbps seems slow may not be far away, however. In November, a team of researchers in Japan broke the world speed record for data transmission when they reached an astonishing 22.9 Pbps. That’s enough bandwidth to supply every single person on the planet, and then a couple billion more, with a Netflix stream, says Chigo Okonkwo at Eindhoven University of Technology, who was involved in the work. In this case, a meaningless but huge stream of pseudorandom data was beamed over 13km of coiled fibre optic cable in a lab setting. Dr Okonkwo explains that the integrity of the data is analysed post-transfer to confirm it was sent as quickly as reported without accumulating too many errors. He also adds that the system he and colleagues used relied on multiple cores – a total of 19 cores inside one fibre cable. This is a new type of cable unlike the standard ones that connect many people’s home to the internet.

But older fibre is expensive to dig up and replace. Extending its lifetime is useful, argues Wladek Forysiak at Aston University in the UK. He and colleagues have recently achieved speeds of around 402 terabits per second (Tbps) along a 50km-long optical fibre with just one core. That’s about 5.7 million times faster than the average UK home broadband connection. “I think it’s a world best, we don’t know of any results that are better than that,” says Prof Forysiak. Their technique relies on using more wavelengths of light than usual when flashing data down an optical line. For this they use alternative forms of the electronic equipment that sends and receives signals over fibre optic cables but such a setup could be easier to install than replacing thousands of kilometres of the cable itself. Activities in the so-called metaverse might one day require extreme bandwidth, suggests Martin Creaner, director general of the World Broadband Association. His organisation expects home broadband connections to reach up to 50 Gbps by 2030. But reliability may be even more important than speed for some applications. “For remote robotic surgery across 3,000 miles… you absolutely do not want any scenario where the network goes down,” says Mr Creaner. Dr Okonkwo adds that training AI will increasingly require moving huge datasets around. The faster this can be done, the better, he argues. And Ian Phillips, who works alongside Prof Forysiak, says bandwidth tends to find applications once it is available: “Humanity finds a way of consuming it.”

TeleGeography Demand for bandwidth is growing surprisingly fast says Lane Burdette","“It was super-cool to see.” He and his colleague Edwin Verheul had just set up a new data link between the LHC in Switzerland and data storage sites in The Netherlands.

Harland and Wolff has reiterated its need for a £200m government loan guarantee to help stabilise its finances

The company has reiterated its need for a £200m government loan guarantee to help stabilise its finances.

It expects to publish those accounts next week.

It has temporarily suspended trading in its shares because it has not been able to publish independently audited accounts on time.

The Belfast-based shipbuilder Harland and Wolff lost another £43m last year, its latest financial statement shows.

Need to refinance £80m loan

It said the delay in its accounts was due to discussions with its auditors about the correct way to account for revenues from complex, multi-year contracts.

It added that agreement had been reached and ""the company will now progress to complete the audit quickly and expects to publish its 2023 annual report during the week commencing 8 July 2024"".

Harland and Wolff was bought out of administration in 2019 and in 2022 was part of the consortium which won a major contract to build three Royal Navy support ships.

The company has had to invest significantly to prepare for that work and has been heavily loss making.

The audited annual accounts for 2022 showed turnover of £28m and a loss of about £70m.

In the previous 17 month accounting period, the loss was more than £25m.

The company has applied for a £200m loan guarantee, which is essential for its financial stability.

It needs to refinance an £80m high interest loan and take on new borrowings as it scales up its operations.

It is seeking to borrow from a consortium of UK banks, but needs the government to act as guarantor - meaning if the loans were to go bad the state would step in to repay the lenders.

The company said it expects the government to reach a decision on the guarantee after this week’s general election.

It added that should there be any ""any material delays"" to guarantee, its ability to ""execute new and large contracts would be adversely affected"".","Harland and Wolff posts £43m lossHarland and Wolff has reiterated its need for a £200m government loan guarantee to help stabilise its financesThe company has reiterated its need for a £200m government loan guarantee to help stabilise its finances.

14 hours ago By Kevin Peachey , Cost of living correspondent Share

A drop in domestic gas and electricity prices has now taken effect, but costs are expected to rise again in October. Regulator Ofgem's new price cap for England, Wales and Scotland came into force on Monday, meaning a typical household's energy bill will fall by £122 a year. That brings down the bill for a household using a typical amount of gas and electricity to £1,568 a year, the lowest for two years. But forecasters expect it to rise again in the run-up to winter, more than reversing the latest drop.

Leading consultancy Cornwall Insight predicts that a typical household's annual bill will be back up to £1,723 in October, a £155, or 10%, increase from now. ""Modest falls in summer look set to be wiped out by bigger rises in autumn when people will need to put the heating back on,"" said Adam Scorer, chief executive of charity National Energy Action. ""The cost of energy remains an unaffordable luxury that many of the poorest simply cannot afford."" Although the price cap is changed every three months, it is illustrated by Ofgem in terms of an annual bill for a household using a typical amount of gas and electricity. People in larger properties will tend to pay more overall owing to higher energy usage, and those in smaller properties will pay less.

That is because the cap, set by Ofgem, limits the maximum price that can be charged for each unit of gas and electricity - not the total bill. It affects the gas and electricity bills of 28 million households, but does not impact customers in Northern Ireland, where the sector is regulated differently but where prices are also falling.

Energy bills are considerably lower than the peak after Russia's invasion of Ukraine, when the government stepped in to limit bill rises. That has fed through to falls in the general rate of rising prices, known as inflation. However, a typical household's energy bill remains about £400 higher than three years ago, prompting debate over the issue during the election campaign.

In addition, households have built up a collective debt to suppliers of about £3bn owing, primarily, to the pressure from high prices. Those on prepayment meters, who tend to top up meters during the colder, darker months and are often under more financial pressure, will see a less immediate impact of a drop in prices in the summer. The vast majority of households pay by direct debit, and their payments are smoothed out over the year. They should have been contacted by their supplier about the latest price changes. Experts say it is a good idea to take a meter reading now, to ensure billpayers are charged at the correct rate. Ofgem is reviewing the way the price cap is calculated, including sifting through a host of responses to a consultation on standing charges.

Latest changes in detail

The new prices that took effect for July to the end of September mean: Gas prices are now capped at 5.48p per kilowatt hour (kWh), and electricity at 22.36p per kWh

A typical household uses 2,700 kWh of electricity a year, and 11,500 kWh of gas

Households on pre-payment meters pay slightly less than those on direct debit, with a typical bill of £1,522

Those who pay their bills every three months by cash or cheque pay more, with a typical bill of £1,668

Standing charges - a fixed daily charge covering the costs of connecting to a supply - are unchanged at 60p a day for electricity and 31p a day for gas, although they vary by region

Dave Ricks urged the next government to consider how it could become ""world class"" in attracting investment

The boss of the world's most valuable pharmaceutical company has told the BBC that the UK's planning system puts companies off investing in the country.

Dave Ricks, chief executive of the obesity drug manufacturer Eli Lilly, said he had considered building a factory in the UK in the last decade, but chose another country instead.

He warned current planning processes were an ""impediment"" to building factories at speed, unlike in the US and Ireland.

""Mostly what they do is they pre-reserve land, they promise to cut through the red tape and layers of government,"" Mr Ricks said.

Eli Lilly, along with its Danish rival Novo Nordisk, has developed a considerable lead over the rest of the pharmaceutical industry when it comes to obesity medication.

Its drugs, which include Zepbound and Mounjaro, are in such demand that the company cannot build factories quickly enough.

The country has operations in the US, Ireland and other European Union countries including Italy, France and Germany.

Mr Ricks said countries that ""could present a path"" in which the time taken to set up a pharmaceutical plant was reduced from five years to two was ""very attractive"".

""In the UK - although I love visiting, it's a wonderful county - it’s not the largest market so you have to overcome that with other attractiveness, whether that be workforce, asset delivery or economic incentives,"" he said.

""You have to be candid, say 'are we as competitive as we can be?' And to date it's been a little bit less, but I think it's not unachievable.""","UK planning laws deter investment, says drugs giantDave Ricks urged the next government to consider how it could become ""world class"" in attracting investmentThe boss of the world's most valuable pharmaceutical company has told the BBC that the UK's planning system puts companies off investing in the country.

Getty Images A lawyer representing families of victims of two fatal Boeing 737 Max crashes says they ""strenuously object to this plea deal""

A lawyer representing victims of two fatal Boeing 737 Max crashes has told the BBC that the US government is preparing to offer the plane maker a ""sweetheart plea deal"". Paul Cassell, who says he got the information ""directly from the Justice Department"", added that the deal includes a small fine, three years of probation and independent safety audits. Boeing did not immediately reply to the BBC's request for comment, while the Justice Department (DoJ) declined to provide a statement. It comes as Boeing announced it had reached a deal to buy the aerospace supplier Spirit AeroSystems - a move it said would improve quality and safety. Spirit made the fuselage that suffered a mid-flight blowout on an Alaska Airlines 737 Max 9 jet in January, sparking widespread concern about standards at Boeing.

'Families will object to this deal'

Last month, US prosecutors recommended that the DoJ bring criminal charges against the plane maker. That was after the DoJ said Boeing had violated a 2021 settlement related to the crashes which killed 346 people. ""The memory of 346 innocents killed by Boeing demands more justice than this,"" said Mr Cassell, adding that the ""families will strenuously object to this plea deal"". The plane crashes - both involving Boeing's 737 Max aircraft - occurred within six months of each other. The crash involving Indonesia's Lion Air occurred in October 2018, followed by an Ethiopian Airlines flight in March 2019. Both crashes were linked to faulty flight control systems. A letter sent last month by Mr Cassell to the DoJ revealed that the families had been seeking prosecutions of Boeing's top executives at the time of the crashes and a fine of $24.8bn (£19.6bn) for ""the deadliest corporate crime in US history"". The Justice Department has until 7 July to decide whether to revive a criminal charge of fraud brought against Boeing in 2021. That charge has lain dormant since the company acknowledged in a settlement that it had misled air-safety regulators about aspects of the 737 Max, and promised to create a new compliance system to detect and prevent further fraud. Under the deal reached in 2021, Boeing said it would pay a $2.5bn settlement and prosecutors agreed to ask the court to drop a criminal charge after three years if the company abided by certain stipulations set out in the deferred prosecution agreement. But in May, the DoJ said Boeing was in breach of the deal, stating that it had failed to ""design, implement, and enforce a compliance and ethics program to prevent and detect violations of the US fraud laws throughout its operations"".","Boeing to get 'sweetheart deal' - victims' lawyer9 hours ago By João da Silva , Business reporter ShareGetty Images A lawyer representing families of victims of two fatal Boeing 737 Max crashes says they ""strenuously object to this plea deal""A lawyer representing victims of two fatal Boeing 737 Max crashes has told the BBC that the US government is preparing to offer the plane maker a ""sweetheart plea deal"".

BBC Qcells is investing billions in a solar panel factory in Georgia

The former “carpet capital of the world” is getting a multi-billion-dollar makeover. Here in the rural Georgian town of Dalton, once known for its fabric floor coverings, a Korean company called Qcells is spending $2.5bn (£2bn) to expand its solar panel factory, with another in the works. It's a bold initiative that will create 2,500 quality jobs in the next 12 months, in an area where the average household income is roughly 27% below the national average. It is hoped the project will revitalise a corner of the US whose glory days seemed over. And it's due in no small part to someone many of the residents of this Republican district would rather not credit - Joe Biden. The president's landmark 2022 Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) – his signature green legislation - offered hundreds of billions of dollars in tax incentives, credits and loans to stimulate American manufacturing in clean energy.

The most ambitious climate legislation in US history has generated a tsunami of private sector investments, with big implications for the rest of the world. And Georgia - a state President Biden hopes is in play in this year’s presidential election - has been a big beneficiary. But with four months before the president goes head-to-head against Donald Trump, the billions of dollars of new investment in this key battleground state doesn’t appear to have lifted the incumbent’s support. President Biden’s pitch is that solving the climate problem is also good for jobs. Since the law was passed, more than 300,000 clean energy jobs have been created in the US, according to the advocacy group Climate Power. And there's no doubt it’s creating opportunities in places like Dalton. Here you see Bidenomics in action - foreign and government money being used to fight climate change and build an economy from the middle out.

Qcells' Scott Moskowitz points to the massive investments in US renewables

Scott Moskowitz, head of market strategy for Qcells, says that Georgia had been a great home since 2019, but that the IRA had been an “accelerant”. Without it, he muses, the current expansion might not have happened at all. “What our industry has seen, since the IRA has passed, is more investment in the past two years in solar and clean energy manufacturing than the previous 20 years,” he says. And yet that message either isn't getting through or simply isn't resonating with locals – not even local Democrats. Jan Pourquoi, the spokesperson for the local Whitfield County Democratic Party, tells me: “In the business community, there is a resentment against that company [Qcells].” Mr Pourquoi, a Belgian expat should know. He owns one of the small carpet firms in town. We spoke in his office, overlooking the factory floor where they turn flooring remnants into small rugs. “The business community resents the fact that we have a company from South Korea coming in this area with government subsidies, while they themselves get nothing from the government,” says Mr Pourquoi, who identified as a Republican before switching parties following Trump’s election in 2016. He tells me that local voters know little about the IRA law. “Nobody cares about clean energy, not around here. That is the type of stuff that I would call the ‘latte liberals’ care about in the big city.”

Qcells Qcells has been expanding its vast factory in Dalton

Well, at least one person does, and that's Marjorie Taylor Greene, the firebrand Republican congressional representative for the district. She has touted Qcells' expansion, despite voting against the law that helped make it possible. It’s creating some awkward dynamics for Republicans. The IRA is in Donald Trump’s sights. If Republican lawmakers win big in the Congressional elections that are also taking place on 5 November, then portions of President Biden’s signature climate law could be repealed, threatening a clean energy boom happening in their communities across the US. I sat down for coffee with Kasey Carpenter, Dalton’s Republican member in the Georgia House of Representatives. We met at Oakwood Café, the bustling diner he owns along with a string of other local businesses, including a pizza joint and a boutique hotel. Mr Carpenter downplayed the potential impact on Qcells of manufacturing tax credits being rolled back. He doesn’t think it would jeopardise the solar investments in his district. But he adds that if clean energy investments were to become at risk “I’m sure we’ll be speaking with the Trump team”. Our conversation ends with him saying it would be another feather in Dalton’s cap if this carpet town could also lay claim to the title of “solar panel capital of the world”.

But that belongs to China, which controls 80% of the world’s solar panel supply chain. For years China has been investing heavily in renewable energy, and is expected to spend a staggering $675bn in 2024, according to an International Energy Agency (IEA) report. To compete, governments around the world have begun throwing hundreds of billions at the green industries of the future. In the EU, investment in clean energy is set to increase to $370bn in 2024, according to the IEA. The predicted figure for the US is $315bn. US Trade Representative Katherine Tai said last year that she hoped the US’s increased spending on renewable energy would help address the “significant distortion” in the global economy caused by China.

Getty Images The former Honda site in Swindon will become a warehousing and logistics facility

Amid a vast expanse of rubble, dust and noise, a green crane yanks away at a corrugated roof like a frustrated dentist attempting to extract a particularly stubborn wisdom tooth. Swindon’s Honda factory - once one of the world’s most advanced car factories - is being demolished, three decades after it opened. This used to be one of the fastest-growing towns in Europe. It was one of the jewels in the crown of investments attracted to the UK by Margaret Thatcher’s brand of 1980s enterprise. Swindon voted for her, John Major, Tony Blair, David Cameron, Theresa May and Boris Johnson. It was also one of the first towns to declare for Brexit, by 55%. But last year, its council changed hands to Labour. The council has had to continue to accelerate cuts to local services, passing a budget with record cuts in order to stave off bankruptcy. Inflation, rising care expenses, and central government grant squeezes meant cuts to libraries, the Dial-a-Ride community transport service and dimmed street lights. There has been an almost 5% rise in council tax. The council leader has warned any further cuts will affect frontline services. What is happening in Swindon is a visible consequence of sluggish long-term economic growth. Government spending cuts, low private investment, deindustrialisation and shrinking disposable income have left scars even on what was one of the UK’s famous boom towns.

The Honda site is set to become a warehousing and logistics facility. In another world, it would have been replaced by another major global manufacturer. Tesla, for example, was invited. Whereas five years ago the promise was to level up left-behind Northern towns, places like Swindon feel levelled down. The question about growth arising in this town is vital to whoever wins Thursday’s election. Elsewhere in the world, sites like this are being repurposed for electric car manufacturing. The Americans are pouring public money into their factories to try to compete with China, who will soon be confirmed as the world’s biggest car exporter. Emerging economies from Indonesia to Vietnam to Turkey are also investing in and growing their car industries. Indeed it was to Turkey that the entire Honda production line, including dozens of never-used industrial robots, was packed up and shipped off via the M4 and Bristol port last year. Swindon is not just about Honda. It is part of the M4 corridor where there are plenty of jobs in the knowledge sectors, and in finance, for example at the headquarters of Nationwide. The overall unemployment rate is just 2.6%, but the number of people not in work and not looking for work is 18%.

Faisal Islam joined Gary Huett, who contacted the BBC as part of the Your Voice, Your Vote election project, for a bike ride around Swindon

Marcus Kittridge, a former Honda engineer who now runs a cafe in the centre of town with his wife Tracey, accepts there are still “good employment prospects” but says many are at or “50p above” minimum wage, and says this has contributed to a decline in disposable income in the centre of town. “It’s like a Northern town that lost its industry in the 1970s,” he tells me. They now shut the cafe at 14:00 every day because of the high price of energy. He expects to be passing on his rising costs in higher prices for the next year or two. They have also stopped selling smoothies, after a notable decline in the availability and quality of fresh fruit, which they blame on post-Brexit changes. “We were told the quality of food was going to go up after Brexit, I can tell you now it has not. I’ve barely heard any politician mention it, but it definitely has had an impact on us,” Tracey says. Might she have been a bit unlucky with her purchases of fresh produce? “If I’m unlucky, I’m getting unlucky every single day and I’m probably the unluckiest person on earth,” she says. Their experience shows that some of the undercurrents of sluggish long-term growth - high energy prices, low disposable income, low investment, and new trade barriers can combine in unusual ways.

Gary Huett, a retired graphic designer also from Swindon who got in touch as part of the BBC's Your Voice, Your Vote project inviting you to tell us what matters, wanted to know why Swindon’s town centre looked like it was “rotting” and asked if anything could change. “We’ve now got pound shops predominantly, and the thriving night scene, packed with the yuppy set in the 1980s and 1990s has gone and decayed.”

Gary Huett wants to know why Swindon's town centre looks like it is ""rotting""

The Conservatives say green shoots are already here. The latest growth figures for January to March show the UK now has the fastest growing economy in the G7 group of advanced economies, after last year’s brief recession. Swindon’s jobs record remains strong. On the Honda site, new investment has come, and the jobs, albeit in warehousing rather than manufacturing, will return. For Labour, Swindon - a bellwether town where residents have voted the same way as the eventual national winner for the last 40 years - shows that there are no quick fixes. They are not competing with the US or European Union (EU) with big public investments in green energy. Council spending remains unprotected and subject to the same ongoing squeeze. A looser planning regime might help build more houses or expand the solar farms that dot the countryside around the town. But the job of transformation is very real. When asked what will happen if the economy does not grow, Labour has responded by saying some variation of “I’m not defeatist” or “we can do it”. When I interviewed shadow chancellor Rachel Reeves in Swindon, I said that if she was relying on planning changes to transform growth prospects, they were going to have to be a revolutionary, almost Thatcher-style ""Big Bang"". She told me: “It’s big reform we are offering… unless we grow the economy we’re going to be stuck in a doom loop of low growth, high taxes and poor public services.” Labour’s hope is that there is a tsunami of private investment that has been held back from this country due to political and economic instability. That, the party says, can be unleashed by the tens of billions with a strong and stable pro-growth government.","Swindon’s Honda factory - once one of the world’s most advanced car factories - is being demolished, three decades after it opened.

Marks & Spencer is launching a new service for clothing repairs and alterations. From August, customers will be able to book through a dedicated online hub and have their fixed items posted back to them within seven to ten days. The work will be carried out by Deliveroo-style repairs start-up Sojo, and its in-house team of tailors, with prices starting at £5. The move comes as retailers try to encourage more sustainable habits among their shoppers.

Sojo launched during the Covid-19 pandemic in 2021 with a mission to make repairing, not simply replacing, clothing more mainstream. M&S said its partnership with Sojo aimed to provide customers with ways to extend the life of their clothing. “Through the launch of our repair service, we’re making it even easier for customers to give their clothes Another life, whether they are using our new repair service or long-standing clothes recycling scheme,"" said Richard Price, managing director of clothing & home at M&S.

Sojo's Josephine Philips wants to make repairing clothes more mainstream

Josephine Philips, Sojo's founder and chief executive, said the partnership marked ""an incredibly big step"" towards its mission of making clothes repairs more accessible. Siobhan Gehin, a retail expert and senior partner at consulting firm Roland Berger, told the BBC that by partnering with smaller, independent repair firms, large brands can provide customers with convenient alterations without having to create the infrastructure for these services themselves.

Growing trend among retailers

M&S is not alone in looking to repair services as a way to seemingly embrace and encourage sustainability. In January, Sojo took up a permanent space in Selfridges on London’s Oxford Street to provide customers with access to its clothing repairs service. The central London department store also gives shoppers access to handbag and trainer restoration services. Japanese fashion retailer Uniqlo, perhaps best known for its viral shoulder bag, offers clothing repairs and additional services such as embroidery for Uniqlo items at six of its UK stores. John Lewis has made its fashion rental service and recycling scheme a key part of its consumer-facing sustainability strategy, alongside accepting and reselling pre-loved products such as electronics and furniture. High Street stores Primark and H&M provide customers with online guides for repairing and maintaining their clothes, such as how to sew buttons and zips on to items or rework them entirely. Primark has also held free repair workshops for customers across the UK and Europe since 2022.

3 days ago Share

BBC

The computer expert who helped build the faulty Horizon software has finally spoken under oath about his involvement in the Post Office scandal. Gareth Jenkins is a key figure, having appeared as an expert witness to defend Horizon in court cases, and is now at the centre of an alleged cover-up. His appearance at the inquiry was long-awaited after being postponed twice. He gave evidence over four days - the longest run of questions any witness has faced - and gave his version of events. Here are five key moments from his evidence.

1. He thought Horizon bugs were fixed quickly

Gareth Jenkins referred to Horizon's overall reliability throughout his testimony, even challenging findings from the landmark Bates v Post Office case that identified issues with the IT system. He acknowledged ""individual problems"" affecting specific branches but asserted that, as a whole, the system was ""working well"". When questioned about bugs, Mr Jenkins admitted lacking personal knowledge of all known issues, stating he typically became involved when drafted in for problem resolution. When pressed on how he could provide court evidence without full oversight of existing problems, Mr Jenkins said: ""Bugs impacting accounts were rare. Monitoring was in place, and fixes were prompt. Therefore, live system problems were rare, making me confident in its operation."" He claimed nobody from the Post Office alerted him to unknown issues, and he didn't actively seek information about bugs he wasn't involved in fixing. Mr Jenkins admitted not realising the need for comprehensive knowledge when giving evidence and ""with hindsight would have done things differently"".

2. He was sent expert witness rules

Mr Jenkins was an “expert witness” in several prosecutions brought by the Post Office. His duty was to the courts, not the Post Office or his employer Fujitsu. His role meant disclosing any relevant information about the Horizon software – even evidence that could help sub-postmasters' cases. Lawyers should have ensured that Mr Jenkins understood this. When asked about this by Mr Beer, Mr Jenkins stated that he didn’t know about his responsibilities until the end of 2020. But Mr Beer showed him a letter from November 2005, written by lawyers working for the Post Office. The letter mentioned that he was an expert witness and, according to Mr Beer, listed his duties in an “easy-to-understand way”. After initially denying he had received it, Mr Jenkins later accepted that it was sent to him. He said he had “no recollection of having been briefed” on his duties and had “clearly forgotten” about having seen the letter.

3. He knew remote access was possible

The former ""distinguished engineer"" faced intense questioning regarding remote access – the ability of Fujitsu staff to modify sub-postmaster branch accounts without their knowledge. In his 2010 witness statement for Seema Misra's trial, he stated: ""No external systems can manipulate branch accounts without user awareness and authorisation."" During the inquiry, Mr Jenkins accepted knowing that remote access was possible but believed it happened infrequently and left a visible trail. He based this view on ""informal chats"" with other Fujitsu IT staff. The former engineer told the inquiry that he only discovered the extent of unrestricted access Fujitsu technical staff had to sub-postmaster accounts during the 2018 High Court battle.

4. He was a 'willing actor' for the Post Office

In 2005, Mr Jenkins was asked to provide a draft witness statement in the case of sub-postmaster Noel Thomas. The Post Office wanted his thoughts on how the losses could have occurred. One possibility, he said, was some sort of system failure. But the Post Office demanded changes, saying the line was potentially “very damaging"". It got deleted. The inquiry heard he was a “willing actor” in this process. He said he was happy with the changes he ended up with as it still accurately reflected what had happened but used “less emotive words"". The Post Office was applying the pressure, but he never checked with his own Fujitsu lawyers about signing off evidence that had been toned down. Earlier he was asked to explain attempts to “tweak” his statements, but Mr Jenkins believed this was more of a “tidying up” to make them easier to read. He said he pushed back when the changes went too far.

5. He was 'better with systems than people'

Four days of forensic questioning meant plenty of room for big revelations. It also meant Gareth Jenkins had nowhere to hide. It was very revealing about the character of the man who has been mentioned so many times at this inquiry. An IT specialist who spent his entire career at one company, by his own admission, he dealt “better with systems than people”. He would have been happiest engineering and designing, but found himself entangled in something very different. Something, he argues, he didn't fully understand. ""Can't you use the report I have already sent you?"" Mr Jenkins wrote to a Post Office lawyer in 2012. It is clear he was viewing the growing number of legal queries as a confusing frustration, taking him away from the tech front line. It is an annoyance that hasn't gone away. At one point, Mr Jenkins told the inquiry chair he wanted this ""over with"". Given the ongoing investigations, that seems unlikely.","What we learned from IT expert at Post Office inquiry3 days ago ShareBBCThe computer expert who helped build the faulty Horizon software has finally spoken under oath about his involvement in the Post Office scandal.

Getty Images Unite workers are set to start striking on 8 July over Tata’s plans to cut 2,800 UK jobs

Tata Steel has offered to meet unions for fresh talks on the condition strike action in south Wales is called off. In a letter to the UK Steel Committee, which represents the Community, Unite and the GMB unions, the company is believed to have offered to discuss future investment in Port Talbot. But the unions would be required to suspend future industrial action. Unite general secretary Sharon Graham told BBC Wales: ""They suspend closure, we suspend action.""

Unite workers are set to start striking on 8 July over Tata’s plans to cut 2,800 UK jobs. The union wants the company to delay the closure of the heavy end of steel production in Port Talbot, which is due to happen by the end of September. Community and GMB have a mandate from their members for strike action but have not confirmed any dates, saying they would wait until after the general election before announcing their next moves. The offer to start fresh talks with the unions follows discussions between Tata and Unite in the days since announcing the proposal to bring forward the closures of both Port Talbot blast furnaces. On Thursday the company said it would close both furnaces this week unless it could ""safely and stably operate"" them during the strike. On Sunday it wrote to all three unions, offering to begin new talks if the strike was called off. The talks are not a renegotiation of the existing plan, but focus on future investment opportunities. Alun Davies, Community’s national officer, said the letter ""simply reaffirms"" the position agreed by the unions and Tata at their last meeting on 22 May, and did not constitute a new agreement in response to Unite's actions. Unite had previously pulled away from multi-union talks, and was the only union to launch industrial action. Mr Davies said it was ""welcome"" Unite were ""reaffirming their commitment to the position they previously agreed"", that unions would agree on a memorandum of understanding before putting it to members to vote on.

Lawyers acting on behalf of two people who fell ill in an E. coli outbreak in the UK have started legal action against two leading supermarkets. Law firm Fieldfisher said on Friday it had issued letters of claim for breach of the Consumer Protection Act over own-brand sandwiches purchased in Tesco and Asda. The claims for compensation relate to a man from the South East and an 11-year-old girl in the North West. One person in England has died linked to the ongoing E. coli outbreak, the UK Health Security Agency said on Thursday, although they had underlying health conditions. The E. coli outbreak is thought to be caused by some supermarket sandwiches containing salad leaves. The large majority of cases reported so far developed symptoms before 4 June and the number of cases being reported is now falling, offering hope the outbreak may have ended. Several food manufacturers recalled some of their products as a precaution. The Food Standards Agency said lettuce is the likely source, based on tests.

Fieldfisher said the claim against Asda related to a young girl who contracted E. coli after eating an own-brand chicken salad sandwich from the supermarket. ""The girl, aged 11, developed the serious condition haemolytic uraemic syndrome (HUS), which attacks the kidneys and has been on dialysis for three weeks,"" it said. ""She was discharged home two days ago but could be at risk of permanent kidney damage. Her mother bought three of the sandwiches as part of an online delivery."" An Asda spokesman said that it had not yet received any letter from Fieldfisher regarding these claims, but added: ""As soon as we do we will review the details of the claim as a matter of urgency."" Harvinder Kaur, a director at Fieldfisher, told the PA News agency earlier on Friday that she had issued a separate letter to Tesco on behalf of a man from the South East. He was also hospitalised with E. coli symptoms after eating Tesco-branded sandwiches containing salad, the law firm claims. ""Luckily, this client did not go on to develop HUS and is now home, but for a time he was seriously ill,"" she said. ""Under the Act, companies producing food must ensure it is safe to eat. ""If it causes illness, it is a breach of their duty and those injured are eligible to claim compensation, not least to fund possible ongoing medical care."" She added that the man was a ""regular shopper"" at Tesco, buying his lunch there most weekdays as it was very close to his work. The BBC understands Tesco has yet to receive the letter from Fieldfisher.

1 day ago By Angie Brown , BBC Scotland, Edinburgh and East reporter Share

BBC Jakub Parulski, who lives with his wife and two young daughters, said they were in a 'horror story'

Residents of affordable housing developments in Edinburgh have said they are ""living in a horror story"" after being hit with a massive rise in their gas bill as costs are beginning to fall across the rest of the country. The Harvester's Way development has 180 properties which are all connected to a district heating system, where one huge gas boiler provides heating and hot water to all the homes. It is billed as a greener and more efficient way to heat their homes but it also means residents are unable to shop around for the best prices. Places For People Scotland, which operates about 1,000 homes across five sites in Edinburgh, has told residents the tariff for gas will jump 450% from 1 August, meaning people in a two-bedroom flat could be paying as much as £400 a month. It said the new heat tariff was procured at the end of last year and reflected the market conditions at the time. The unit price for gas can vary significantly and energy companies also impose standing charges, but the average UK unit price is currently just above 7p per kWh. The Harvester's Way residents were paying 4p/kWh but that is increasing to 22.18p/kWh.

Some of the residents from People For Places developments in Edinburgh who say they cannot pay their new gas bill prices

Jakub Parulski, who lives on the development with his wife Kasia and two young daughters, said his monthly gas bill will rise from £60 to £350. He said: ""These properties were aimed at affordable housing for low income families, this is not affordable by any means and we are very anxious about this. ""The problem is we can't boycott paying because we have pre-payment, pay-as-you go meters so they have us locked. ""We have no choice. The only choice we have is if we go cold with our small kids in the property."" The low carbon heating and hot water district heat network has a smart valve in each home linking payments to access to heating and hot water. As long as their account is in credit, the valve will remain open and they have access to heating and hot water. If an account runs out of credit, the valve closes until a top-up payment is made. Mr Parulski said he would not be able to sell his house because no-one would buy a property with such a high gas tariff. ""We are absolutely devastated. We are going to be locked in properties we cannot afford,"" he said. ""People will lose their homes. Some of us are looking at being homeless, some of us are nosediving into poverty. ""It is impossible now for us to sell our properties. We feel trapped and this is beginning to be a horror story and is no joke for a lot of us. ""It is really desperate.""

Henda Sankareh said she got the ""fright of her life"" at the new gas prices

The price rise was first introduced in April but delayed after residents complained. They told BBC Scotland the first they knew about their tariff changing was when credit in their pay-as-you-go meters suddenly dropped overnight. When Henda Sankareh noticed she had no hot water to wash her four-month-old baby at her rented flat on the Harvester's Way development she thought the boiler was broken. So the mother-of-two called the managers running the development to report the fault. But the 30-year-old said she got the ""fright of her life"" when they told her there was no problem with the heating and instead she had just run out of credit. She checked her meter and was shocked to see her monthly instalment had disappeared in less than a week. She said: ""They just told me the price had gone up so I needed to put more money in the meter. ""That's when I got into a panic. All the money had gone in just five days. I had had no notice or letter or email to warn me.""

Scott Walker with his wife Samantha and daughter Molly

After residents complained they had been given no warning Places for People Scotland launched an investigation. The company agreed to pay the higher tariff bill until the end of July but then residents would be locked into the new rates until the end of March 2025. In a letter to residents, it said: ""The procurement process requires us to adhere to terms and conditions known as the deed of conditions, which states we must get at least five cost quotes for price comparison before agreeing on a provider. ""Due to difficulties in finding gas suppliers for district heating, many providers chose not to participate."" Scott Walker, 50, a quality control technician living on the Harvester's Way development, said: ""I got a fright and felt very angry when I did the figures in my head and realised this was impossible to pay. ""We can't afford to move. He added: ""When we bought this house we were told this heating system was really efficient. ""We need to try to reduce the tariff. Obviously it has to go up but not that kind of percentage. It's extortionate. We would take a normal price that everyone else pays. ""I want to get an independent review done of the heating system and how they have come to these figures.""

The economy grew by more than initially estimated in the first three months of 2024 as the UK emerged from recession, revised official figures show.

Between January and March, the economy grew by 0.7% the Office for National Statistics (ONS) said.

Figures released last month initially estimated growth had been 0.6%.

The strength of the economy has been a central battleground in the general election campaign, with growth having been sluggish in recent years.

Most economists, politicians and businesses want to see GDP rising steadily, because it usually means people are spending more, extra jobs are created, more tax is paid to the government and workers get better pay rises.

The original figure for the first quarter of the year was stronger than economists had expected, and growth in the services sector, which includes businesses such as hairdressers, banks, and hospitality, helped to push it higher, the ONS said.

But while services growth was revised upwards, increases in manufacturing were revised down on the back of more data being collected.

Due to the upward revision, the UK was the fastest growing economy in the G7 group of countries with advanced economies in the first three months of this year.

Prime Minister and Conservative leader Rishi Sunak hailed the new revised growth and said his party had a ""clear plan to deliver a more secure future for your family"".

But Labour accused the Conservatives of ""14 years economic vandalism"", which it said had left people worse off.

""A Labour government will grow the economy and show Britain is open for business with a plan for growth, so that we can put money back in people’s pockets,"" said a spokesperson.

Sarah Olney, Liberal Democrat Treasury spokesperson, said despite the upward revision, the figures would ""come as cold comfort for families being hammered by spiralling mortgage repayments, unfair stealth taxes and the cost of a weekly food shop going through the roof"".","UK economy grew more than estimated in early 2024The economy grew by more than initially estimated in the first three months of 2024 as the UK emerged from recession, revised official figures show.

3 days ago By Mark Palmer , BBC News Share

Getty Images The company had originally planned to shut down one of the blast furnaces by the end of June and the second by September

Workers at Tata Steel have been told the company is taking steps to potentially cease operations at much of the Port Talbot plant by 7 July because of a strike by the trade union Unite. The company had originally been planning to shut one of the blast furnaces by the end of June and the second one by September. But Port Talbot workers have been told that because of the strike from 8 July, the company can no longer be assured of sufficient resources being available to ensure safe and stable operations. The Unite union said Tata's statement to shut or pause the blast furnaces three months earlier than intended was the latest in a long line of threats and it would not deter them. The Welsh government said it cannot and will not support the closure of both blast furnaces.

Last week the Unite union announced that about 1,500 workers would begin an indefinite strike on 8 July over the company's plans to cut thousands of jobs. Onay Kasab, the national lead for Unite, told Radio Wales Breakfast that the union was due to have a conversation with the company regarding safety during the strike. Mr Kasab denied if the union had given the company an opportunity to shut the site. ""What other option have we got when we are facing 2,800 job losses. We have said to Tata, again and again, 'wait for a general election, wait for a new Labour government'"" he said. Mr Kasab said the union have a letter from the company asking the union to wait until after the general election for discussions to take place. However, the company previously said it would not be changing course in Port Talbot, regardless of who wins the general election. About 2,800 Tata Steel workers will lose their jobs when the company closes both blast furnaces in Port Talbot by the end of September. At the time, the company said if the strike affected the safety or stability of its operations it would be ""forced"" to accelerate closure plans. A spokesperson for Tata said: ""Following the announcement by Unite union to unilaterally call strike action from 8 July, Tata Steel is unfortunately forced to commence legal action to challenge the validity of Unite's ballot. ""In the coming days, if we cannot be certain that we are able to continue to safely and stably operate our assets through the period of strike action, we will not have any choice but to pause or stop heavy end operations [including both blast furnaces] on the Port Talbot site. ""That is not a decision we would take lightly, and we recognise that it would prove extremely costly and disruptive throughout the supply chain, but the safety of people on or around our sites will always take priority over everything else."" Tata said it is again calling on Unite to withdraw its industrial action and join Community and GMB unions in ""giving consideration"" to the company's proposal, which Tata said includes ""generous employee support packages, training and skills development"". It said it ""understands"" the impact the restructuring will have on many employees and contractors, but that it ""remains committed to a just transition"" and hopes for a ""long and sustainable future"" in the UK. The company plans to build a £1.25bn electric arc furnace to produce steel in a way which is less polluting than traditional blast furnaces but requires fewer workers. Tata said the move would secure the future of steelmaking at the site and the UK government is contributing £500m towards the cost of the project. The plans for the site will see both furnaces shut down. Number five will go off by the end of next week as planned while four is due to go off by the end of September. Preparatory work to shut down five will begin by 1 July if the strike goes ahead. Other elements that will close include the harbour, sinter plant, ore yards and primary steelmaking.

PA Media Unite union workers are protesting against Tata Steel's plans to cut 2,800 jobs

Sharon Graham, the Unite general secretary, said the union is ""fighting for the future of the steel industry"". She said Unite has secured ""serious investment"" from Labour to safeguard jobs. ""Tata putting out a statement to shut or pause its blast furnaces three months earlier than they intended to is the latest in a long line of threats that won't deter us. ""The Unite campaign is not about selling jobs, it's about securing the long-term future of steel making in this country for thousands of workers in Port Talbot and South Wales."" Unite said it is calling on the ""real decision makers"" in Mumbai to realise that ""the investment secured will be good for the company and workers."" GMB union said Tata must ""step back"" from this ""irreversible decision"" and instead ""safeguard steelmaking assets"". GMB national officer, Charlotte Brumpton-Childs, said that the upcoming general election could ""change so much"", and that GMB's next actions would be decided by its members. The Community union condemned Tata's ""unacceptable"" decision to bring forward the closure and said it continued to support the Labour Party's call for Tata not to make irreversible decisions before the general election.

Analysis by Ben Price, BBC Wales News

Developments have escalated quickly in the past two weeks. Unite is one of three unions which represents steelworkers and it has so far been the most militant in its action in the face of significant job cuts across Tata’s UK operations. Members are currently working to rule and there’s a ban on any overtime. However, the decision to walk out indefinitely is an escalation which now potentially threatens the early closure of the UK’s largest steelmaking operation in Port Talbot. Tata says it would have no option but to close if the strike goes ahead, but in the meantime the company has filed for an injunction at the High Court to try to prevent the strike happening. It suggests Unite’s ballot on industrial action wasn’t carried out properly. With the action due on 8 July, Tata will need a ruling quickly. The other unions, Community and GMB, say they’ll wait until after the general election before deciding whether to strike too. But having spoken to a number of steelworkers in Port Talbot, the sense is that many don’t want a strike which could cost them the current offer on the table from the company. What happens during the course of the next week could be crucial to the future of thousands of livelihoods, although Tata says no redundancies will be made until the end of September, regardless.

Workers and local people have protested about the closure plans

First Minister Vaughan Gething described the news from Tata as ""extraordinary"" and urged the company to wait for the result of next week's general election. In a statement, Mr Gething said: ""The news that Tata could switch off blast furnaces four and five at Port Talbot next week is extraordinary and will cause huge anxiety for the workforce, their families and the community. ""The Welsh government cannot and will not support the closure of both blast furnaces"". He added that acting whilst the nation went to the polls did not help de-escalate matters. Samuel Kurtz, the Welsh Conservative shadow minister for economy and energy,said it was ""disappointing news that will cause additional distress to communities already dealing with enough as it is"". ""Tata have shown no goodwill to their workforce at what is an anxious time. “The Welsh Labour government have also only paid lip service to Tata's workforce, failing to contribute a penny to the transition board, and UK Labour's manifesto says nothing on what it would do differently to support Port Talbot's steelworkers,"" he added. Luke Fletcher, Plaid Cymru's economy spokesperson, said steel should be brought under the control of the next UK government, which Plaid believes will be led by Sir Keir Starmer. Mr Fletcher said: ""The time has come now for an incoming Labour government to put words into action on steel. ""Save our steel is no good as just a slogan, if we are going to save our steel, nationalisation needs to happen on day one.""","The Welsh government said it cannot and will not support the closure of both blast furnaces.

Getty Images Aer Lingus have now cancelled almost 400 flights

Aer Lingus has confirmed it is cancelling a further 122 flights up until 7 July due to the ongoing industrial action by pilots. The airline has now cancelled almost 400 flights as a result of an indefinite work-to-rule and strike action by pilots. The work-to-rule means not working over time or carrying out any other out-of-hours duties. An eight-hour strike from 05:00 -13:00 local time is planned for Saturday. Aer Lingus said that due to the “indefinite nature” of Irish Air Line Pilots' Association pilots’ industrial action it “must cancel” additional flights up to 7 July.

RTE Dublin Airport on the first day of industrial action

Irish broadcaster RTÉ had reported that the recommendation for an additional strike was made by IALPA on Thursday. However, on Friday afternoon, Capt Mark Tighe, president of the union, said that Ireland's Labour Court has invited both parties in the dispute to return to them on Monday afternoon. ""We are in the process of discussing that and that of course would have relevance to whether or not we escalate the industrial action,"" he told Radio Ulster's Evening Extra programme. ""I’m hoping now that they have noted the seriousness of the situation and that they’ll be able to apply their considerable expertise."" Talks between it and Aer Lingus to resolve the ongoing pay dispute broke down without a resolution on Thursday.

School pupils 'slept on floor'

A group of students and teachers from Shimna Integrated School in County Down who were retuning from a trip to Berlin had their flight home cancelled while they were in the airport. Teacher Luke McWatters, said that their 21:45 flight on Thursday was initially showing as delayed and then, more than two hours after the flight was initially due to take off, they were told it was cancelled. “Trying to ring through to Aer Lingus I was on three different calls to three different agents who, every time I got to a certain way through said: ‘Because you’re a group we can’t do anything for you -you have to contact group Aer Lingus who don’t open until 9am’.” Mr McWatters told the BBC’s Evening Extra programme that he felt they had been “left high and dry”, with no offer of accommodation or food.

Luke McWatters Luke McWatters said support from the airline ""fell short"" of what was expected

He said the group slept on the airport floor. Mr McWatters said they were offered an alternative flight on 1 July. “At that stage we made the call to try other airlines and split ourselves up as a group,” he added. Half of the group travelled to Edinburgh, while the other half caught a flight to Poland, with both groups booked on flights back to Ireland on Friday. Mr McWatters said that the support for Aer Lingus had “fallen very short of what you would expect from a major airline dealing with children”. The BBC has contacted Aer Lingus for a response.

'Reasonable pay claim'

Capt Tighe said ""passengers are extremely dear to us as pilots. Management don’t meet you, we do every day. ""We’ve been left in a position where our pay is being eroded and all we’re looking to do is maintain our pay."" Speaking to BBC News NI's Good Morning Ulster programme on Friday, Capt Tighe said in an effort to resolve the dispute, the union had said it would accept less than an inflationary rise. ""We don’t believe anybody should be getting less than inflation, but yesterday in an effort to resolve this, we said we would accept less than inflation."" However, he added: ""We believe inflation is a very reasonable claim in this current time.""

PA Media IALPA President Capt Mark Tighe said the Labour Court has invited both sides to further discussions on Monday

Additional strike action?

IALPA had recommended to trade union Fórsa that the additional strike should be longer than the action planned for Saturday, RTÉ has reported. If sanctioned, Fórsa will have to give seven days’ notice to Aer Lingus before pilots can stop work. Aer Lingus has described the potential of further strike action as ""entirely inappropriate given the request of the Labour Court this week that the dispute should not be escalated"". Donal Moriarty, Aer Lingus' chief corporate affairs officer, said the airline is ""willing to go back to the Labour Court on a formal joint referral basis"". He said Aer Lingus has encouraged IALPA and Fórsa to ""agree to this step"".

How many Aer Lingus flights have been cancelled?

All Aer Lingus UK regional flights, operated by Emerald Airlines, and Aer Lingus UK transatlantic flights to and from Manchester will operate as scheduled. A full list of cancelled flights can be found on the airline's website.

How much are Aer Lingus pilots paid?

Co-pilots can start out at about €36,000 (£30,400), with packages increasing based on actual flying hours. Irish broadcaster RTÉ has reported a captain at the top of the scale can be paid about €287,000 (£242,000). Capt Mark Tighe explained on Thursday that this can take up to 26 years. There are differences for pilots depending on whether flights are short or long-haul.

3 days ago By Tom Espiner , BBC business reporter Share

BBC

Former Fujitsu engineer and Horizon expert Gareth Jenkins has said he didn't think the software was ""a monster"" and that he was ""trapped into doing things I shouldn't have done"". Speaking at an inquiry into the Horizon scandal, Mr Jenkins was accused by lawyer Flora Page of ""protecting"" it when he gave evidence as an expert witness between 2010 and 2013. Ms Page represents Horizon victims including former sub-postmaster Seema Misra, who Mr Jenkins gave evidence against in 2010. Ms Misra told the BBC the system was a monster which ""had blood on its hands, and so do the people who protect [it]"".

Between 1999 and 2015, the Post Office prosecuted hundreds of sub-postmasters on the strength of faulty Horizon data, with 700 convicted of offences such as theft and false accounting. Horizon falsely flagged discrepancies in accounts, with many sub-postmasters using their own savings to make good the imaginary shortfalls. The wrongful prosecutions, which have been called one of the biggest British miscarriages of justice, had a devastating effect on the lives of the sub-postmasters affected. They faced financial ruin and the loss of standing in their communities. Some sub-postmasters ended up taking their own lives after being pursued by the Post Office for supposed losses, including Martin Griffiths, whose widow was later paid in instalments by the Post Office for her silence, the inquiry heard in April.

Giving his fourth day of evidence at the inquiry into the Horizon scandal, Mr Jenkins was questioned by Ms Page, a barrister who represented Horizon victims including Seema Misra. Ms Misra was pregnant with her second child when she was convicted of theft and sent to jail in 2010. She later told the BBC she would have killed herself had she not been pregnant at the time. In a charged atmosphere at the hearing, with Ms Misra sitting next to her, Ms Page accused Mr Jenkins of being a ""Fujitsu man"". She said Mr Jenkins ""knew the Misra trial was a test case for Horizon"". Ms Page alleged his role was to make sure Horizon had a ""clean bill of health"" and that he had ""tailored"" his evidence accordingly. ""My role was to tell the truth,"" Mr Jenkins said. ""I attempted to answer as best I could the questions I was asked"". Ms Page responded: ""Never mind whether a by-product of protecting the monster was that a woman was sent to jail"". Mr Jenkins said he was ""sorry for had happened to Mrs Misra"" but he felt that was down the to way that the Post Office had behaved and wasn't ""purely down to me"". ""I clearly got trapped into doing things I shouldn't have done, but that was not intentional on my behalf,"" he said.

Mr Jenkins was part of the Fujitsu team that developed the Horizon software, and part of his role was dealing with bugs in the system. Mr Jenkins has maintained throughout his evidence that he didn't understand his previous duties as an expert witness to tell the court about problems with Horizon, and that he didn't know that he shouldn't just narrowly answer questions about the technology. Under questioning at the inquiry on Friday, Mr Jenkins said: ""I appreciate that I got things very wrong, but it was done through ignorance rather than maliciousness"". He added that the Horizon system ""as a whole was working well"". Mr Jenkins is currently being investigated by the Metropolitan Police on suspicion of perjury - lying to a court, and perverting the course of justice. No criminal charges have been brought.","Fujitsu expert: I didn't think Horizon was a monster3 days ago By Tom Espiner , BBC business reporter ShareBBCFormer Fujitsu engineer and Horizon expert Gareth Jenkins has said he didn't think the software was ""a monster"" and that he was ""trapped into doing things I shouldn't have done"".

Thousands of UK bank customers were hit by payment problems affecting some of the biggest High Street lenders on Friday.

Banks including HSBC, Nationwide, Barclays and Virgin Money were all affected by issues with a system that operates payments between individuals and firms.

The group overseeing the payments system said the issue causing the problems has now been fixed, and the payment backlog has been cleared.

However, several people have told the BBC they are still facing issues, with some saying they now have little cash left.

The timing of the glitches was particularly problematic given the last Friday of the month is when many salaried staff are usually paid.

Many people also have to pay bills around this time.

""My bills are bouncing and I can’t pay for a train ticket I need in the next hour,"" said one customer on X.

Another said customers deserved compensation for the ""inconvenience on people’s pay day"".

""We all have bills to pay,"" they added.

Ryan, from Telford, who did not want his surname to be used, said he had not received his wages and as a result has £12 to his name.

The 29-year-old engineer said bills had started to be declined on his account.

""I’m supposed to be moving home next week and my savings have been emptied for deposits and rent,"" he said.

The BBC understands that the banks were affected by issues to Faster Payments, a system that operates ""under the bonnet"" of the UK financial system.

It aims to make sure real-time payments between millions of individuals and businesses are made seemingly instantly.

Pay UK, which oversees the system, said: ""We are aware that a small number of Faster Payments were delayed or not processed earlier today.

""Working with our infrastructure provider, this technical issue has been fixed.""

It then added later that ""payments have returned to normal and the backlog is resolved"".

However, some banking customers have disputed this, telling the BBC they have still yet to receive their salary payments.

HSBC, Nationwide, Barclays and Virgin Media had all apologised earlier for the delays to payments.

This is not the first time High Street lenders' services have been hit by problems.

Nationwide customers faced similar issues in March, while HSBC customers suffered an outage lasting over 24 hours in November.","Major UK high street banks say payment issues fixedThousands of UK bank customers were hit by payment problems affecting some of the biggest High Street lenders on Friday.

Nike shares plunged more than 12% in after hours trading

Nike has said it expects a surprise 10% drop in quarterly revenue, as it faces growing competition from newer rivals such as On and Hoka.

The news sent Nike shares plunging more than 12% in after hours trading, which could mean a loss of $15bn in market value if the losses hold on Friday.

The world's largest sportswear company also told investors it is facing weakening demand in international markets, including in China.

But Nike is optimistic that new products and a marketing campaign at the upcoming Olympic Games in Paris will help the company regain momentum with consumers.

""The Paris Olympics offers us a pinnacle moment to communicate our vision of sport to the world,"" CEO John Donahoe said on the earnings call.

The company also lowered its outlook for the 2025 fiscal year.

It said direct-to-consumer business declined 8%, as some customers went for more trendy upstart brands.

""There's a sense that Nike just hasn't innovated enough, it hasn't marketed enough, it hasn't told enough stories around its products,"" the Managing director of GlobalData Retail, Neil Saunders, told the BBC.

The sportswear giant's strategy to sell its products through its own stores and website instead of wholesales like Foot Locker hurt sales, Reuters said.

""Nike needs to get on the front foot again in terms of persuading people to buy its products,"" Mr Saunders added.

Prosecutors say through their actions the employees avoided losses ranging from $24,000 to more than$108,000.

Three employees of subsidiaries of HYBE, the agency behind K-pop superstars BTS, have been charged with insider trading by South Korean prosecutors.

They are being accused of selling shares in the agency before BTS members announced they were taking a break on 14 June, 2022.

The announcement sent HYBE shares plunging 25% when markets opened, resulting in a loss in market value of nearly 2 trillion won ($1.4bn; £1.1bn).

The prosecutors said the three employees acted with prior knowledge of what was about to happen, avoiding losses ranging from $24,000 to more than $108,000.

At the time, many analysts speculated about the reasons for the hiatus, with some saying the band members would have to attend South Korea's mandatory 18-month military service.

South Korea is still technically at war with North Korea, so nearly all able-bodied men are obliged to enlist for 18 months by the time they turn 28.

All members of the band would end up being drafted in the months and years that followed.

The oldest member of the hit boy band, Jin, was discharged earlier this month after completing his service.

The other six - J-Hope, V, RM, Jimin, Jung Kook and Suga - are still serving and the band is expected to reunite only in June 2025.

Fans of the wildly popular boyband are hoping Jin's return is also the beginning of BTS' return from its hiatus.","K-pop agents charged with insider trading over BTSProsecutors say through their actions the employees avoided losses ranging from $24,000 to more than$108,000.

An electric car battery developed by UK start-up Nyobolt has successfully charged from 10% to 80% in four minutes and 37 seconds in its first live demonstration.

It was achieved with a specially-built concept sports car on a test track in Bedford, and is part of industry-wide efforts to get electric vehicles (EVs) charging more quickly.

By comparison, an existing Tesla supercharger can charge a car battery to 80% in 15-20 minutes.

Experts say eliminating so-called ""range anxiety"" is key to increasing uptake of EVs - but also stress the importance of improving the charging infrastructure.

“Developing technology that enables people to charge more quickly, which chimes with the time it currently takes to re-fuel a car – is really important,"" Paul Shearing, Professor of Sustainable Energy Engineering at Oxford University, told the BBC.

But he added there needed to be more chargers of all types.

Getty Images Amazon had to defend the use of AI technology in its physical grocery stores

Amazon received critical headlines this year when reports questioned the “Just Walk Out” technology installed at many of its physical grocery stores. The AI-powered system enables customers at many of its Amazon Fresh and Amazon Go shops to simply pick their items, and then leave. The AI uses lots of sensors to work out what you have chosen. You then get automatically billed. However, back in April it was widely reported that rather than solely using AI, Just Walk Out needed around 1,000 workers in India to manually check almost three quarters of the transactions.

Amazon was quick to claim that the reports were “erroneous”, and that staff in India were not reviewing video footage from all the shops. Instead it said that the Indian workers were simply reviewing the system. Amazon added that “this is no different than any other AI system that places a high value on accuracy, where human reviewers are common”. Whatever the exact details of the Amazon case, it is a high-profile example of a new and growing question – whether companies are making over-inflated claims about their use of AI. It is a phenomenon that has been dubbed “AI washing” in reference to the environmental ""green washing"".

But first, a reminder of what exactly AI means. While there is no exact definition, AI allows computers to learn and solve problems. AI is able to do this after first being trained on huge amounts of information. The specific type of AI that has made all the headlines over the past few years is so-called ""generative AI"". This is AI that specialises in creating new content, be it having text conversations, or producing music or images. Chatbots like ChatGPT, Google's Gemini, and Microsoft's Copilot are popular examples of generative AI. When it comes to AI washing, there are several types. Some companies claim to use AI when they're actually using less-sophisticated computing, while others overstate the efficacy of their AI over existing techniques, or suggest that their AI solutions are fully operational when they are not. Meanwhile, other firms are simply bolting an AI chatbot onto their existing non-AI operating software. While only 10% of tech start-ups mentioned using AI in their pitches in 2022, this rose to more than a quarter in 2023, according to OpenOcean, a UK and Finland-based investment fund for new tech firms. It expects that figure to be more than a third this year. And, says OpenOcean team member Sri Ayangar, competition for funding and the desire to appear on the cutting edge have pushed some such companies to overstate their AI capabilities. ""Some founders seem to believe that if they don’t mention AI in their pitch, this may put them at a disadvantage, regardless of the role it plays in their solution,"" says Mr Ayangar. ""And from our analysis, a significant disparity exists between companies claiming AI capabilities, and those demonstrating tangible AI-driven results.""

Sri Ayangar Sri Ayangar says that some start-up bosses feel they just have to mention AI

It is a problem that has quietly existed for a number of years, according to data from another tech investment firm, MMC Ventures. In a 2019 study it found that 40% of new tech firms that described themselves as ""AI start-ups"" in fact used virtually no AI at all. ""The problem is the same today, plus a different problem,"" says Simon Menashy, general partner at MMC Ventures. He explains that ""cutting-edge AI capabilities"" are now available for every company to buy for the price of standard software. But that instead of building a whole AI system, he says many firms are simply popping a chatbot interface on top of a non-AI product.

Douglas Dick, UK head of emerging technology risk at accountancy giant KPMG, says the problem of AI washing is not helped by the fact there not a single agreed definition of AI. ""If I asked a room of people what their definition of AI is, they would all give a different answer,” he says. “The term is used very broadly and loosely, without any clear point of reference. It is this ambiguity that is allowing AI washing to emerge. ""AI washing can have concerning impacts for businesses, from overpaying for technology and services to failing to meet operational objectives the AI was expected to help them achieve."" Meanwhile, for investors it can make it harder to identify genuinely innovative companies. And, says Mr Ayangar: ""If consumers have unmet expectations from products that claim to offer advanced AI-driven solutions, this can erode trust in start-ups that are doing genuinely ground-breaking work.""

Regulators, in the US at least, are starting to take notice. Earlier this year, the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) said it was charging two investment advisory firms with making false and misleading statements about the extent of their use of AI. ""The firm stance taken by the SEC demonstrates a lack of leeway when it comes to AI washing, indicating that, at least in the US, we can expect more fines and sanctions down the line for those who violate the regulations,"" says Nick White, partner at international law firm Charles Russell Speechlys.

Nick White Nick White says that it is good to see US regulators clamping down on the problem","What is 'AI washing' and why is it a problem?
