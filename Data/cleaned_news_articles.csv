Southeast Asia has emerged as a top choice for firms looking to diversify production away from China, including Chinese companies, amid escalating tensions between Washington and Beijing. ""Southeast Asia is well-placed to benefit significantly from the China+1 phenomenon as both foreign and Chinese companies diversify their supply chains and operations,"" said Kuo-Yi Lim, co-founder and managing partner of Southeast Asian venture capital firm Monk's Hill Ventures. ""Geopolitical [tensions have] accelerated these activities, which started during the Covid lockdowns,"" Lim added. The ""China Plus One"" strategy seeks to reduce the risks associated with total reliance on China's market or supply chain through diversifying manufacturing operations, expanding into other countries even as companies' maintain a presence in China. This has spurred greater investments into the ASEAN bloc. Foreign direct investments into the ASEAN economies of Indonesia, Malaysia, Philippines, Thailand, Singapore and Vietnam rose to $236 billion in 2023 compared with an annual average of $190 billion between 2020 and 2022, OCBC economists said in a May report. The inflows mostly came from the U.S., Japan, European Union as well as Mainland China & Hong Kong. ""The ASEAN-6 region has benefited from a diversification of global and regional supply chain as well as the adoption of 'China+1' strategies. FDI inflows from Mainland China and Hong Kong SAR into the region have risen, with manufacturing and certain services receiving the bulk of inflows,"" the OCBC economists said.

Vietnam

Vietnam has become a key manufacturing location for Apple as the U.S. tech giant seeks to diversify the assembly of its products away from China. Beijing's tough Covid-19 measures and worker unrest at Foxconn's flagship iPhone factory had majorly disrupted production. MacBooks, iPads and Apple Watches are reportedly being manufactured in Vietnam. ""Vietnam's proximity to China has long made it a preferred destination for supply chains to offshore processes that could drastically reduce costs of production,"" said Yinglan Tan, founding managing partner at Insignia Ventures Partners. Vietnam is already a major research and development hub for Samsung, as well as a manufacturing and export base for Samsung's smartphones, according to local reports.

""Vietnam has added advantages. Its competitive labor costs, market access – it has a whole slew of free-trade agreements – so that makes it a lot easier to export to other markets, for example, the EU,"" Kai Wei Ang, ASEAN economist at BofA Securities, told CNBC's ""Squawk Box Asia"" earlier this month.

Malaysia

Malaysia has seen semiconductor firms including Intel, GlobalFoundries and Infineon setting up or expanding operations in the country over the last few years amid U.S.-China tensions. ""Malaysia has seen a revival in its longstanding semiconductor sector, attracting renewed investments from companies such as Intel,"" said Lim of Monk's Hill Ventures. Industry observers said that Malaysia's edge has always been its skilled labor in chip packaging, assembly and testing, and relatively lower operating costs. ""It's not just the semiconductor stories in Malaysia that's taking off. You do see a lot more investments into data centers that have come into play, especially the last couple of months, and perhaps there's other sectors, like solar, EV related components as well. So Malaysia is getting that breadth of investments into the country,"" said Ang of BofA Securities.

Indonesia

The archipelago has vast resources of copper, nickel, cobalt and bauxite — crucial for the manufacturing of electric vehicle batteries. ""Indonesia – that's another interesting country as well – where they are hoping to emerge as an integrated EV hub,"" Ang said. ""It's probably still at a very early stage, but they are looking to scale up capacity across the whole supply chain."" The Indonesian government has been luring EV companies with incentives to set up local manufacturing bases. ""China+1 is not only for foreign companies in China. Geopolitics and international trade developments also push Chinese manufacturers to diversify their production geographically,"" said Anders C. Johansson, director of Stockholm China Economic Research Institute under Stockholm School of Economics, in a LinkedIn post last week. The industry ministry said earlier this month that it had entered an agreement with four Chinese companies – Neta, Wuling, Chery, and Sokon – to establish Indonesia as an EV production hub. Chinese electric vehicle maker BYD plans to start commercial production of EVs in Indonesia in 2026, according to local reports.

Singapore National Paralympic Council

The 2024 Paris Games offer Singaporean para-athlete Toh Wei Soong a second chance. After narrowly missing out on the podium at the 2020 Tokyo Games, Toh is hoping to medal when he competes in the Paralympic Games this summer. Diagnosed with transverse myelitis at a young age, the inflammation in Toh's spinal cord affected his lower nervous system and restricted the use of his legs. Toh started swimming regularly for physiotherapy, but it quickly became much more than that. ""Despite my condition, I realized that not only did I enjoy swimming, but I was good at it,"" he told CNBC Make It. ""It was a source of pride and identity, especially during my teenage years when I represented my school in national competitions."" As Toh dedicated himself to the sport, he set his sights on the international para stage. But pursuing those dreams meant Toh spent up to 24 hours a week in rigorous training, which often meant skipping social outings or holidays. ""Water is not a natural environment for us … it's something we have to learn how to do and naturally the technique doesn't come to us,"" he said. ""To maintain that technique takes a lot of effort.""

Overcoming lows

Toh said one of the biggest challenges was juggling his international baccalaureate studies while trying to qualify for the 2016 Paralympic Games in Rio de Janeiro. ""When I didn't meet the standard [to qualify for the Paralympics], I felt very, very burnt out, very jaded with putting so much effort and seeing both catch fire,"" he said. But Toh acknowledged these experiences taught him how to live with disappointment and helped him grow as a person. ""I think it's commonly said that you have to push past those low moments. You have to not give up to be able to find your success,"" he said.

Despite his hardships, Toh explained that the disappointment allowed him to grow as a person and athlete. Calvin Teoh | Singapore National Paralympic Council

Toh also called out the disparity in media coverage and societal recognition between disabled athletes and their able-bodied peers. ""I think reality speaks for itself. If they wanted to put a full media team behind major parasports games, they would send them. But more often than not, they do not,"" he said. ""And I think this is a disservice to the athletes who train and the caregivers who put so much effort in."" He said the underrepresentation is ""disheartening and confusing"" as they can net just as many medals as able-bodied athletes. ""Many of us train just as hard as able-bodied athletes, undergoing stressors like chronic medical conditions and difficulties in sponsorships and specialized equipment,"" he said. But Toh also said his disability has granted him a unique perspective. ""My disability has made me unique in my way of seeing the world,"" he said. ""It makes me more sensitive to other ways of seeing the world and for the things that people take for granted.""

Toh, who is setting his sights on Paris 2024, believes that medaling would be a ""stepping stone"" to his long-term dream of living life fully. Calvin Teoh | Singapore National Paralympic Council

Toh explained that it's overall an experience that he is proud to have and is grateful for despite the struggles, given his support network. ""It makes me a more compassionate human being,"" he said. ""I don't think it makes me a better human being, but it gives me another side of life.""

Fortune,https://fortune.com/well/article/best-time-of-day-to-exercise/,24.06.24,00:00:00 UTC,"The best time of day to exercise, according to science","Claire Zulkey, a 44-year-old Chicago-area freelance writer, has a well-established morning routine: She gets her kids off to school, turns the television to a favorite show, and gets moving with a full-body workout. Once completed, Zulkey showers and settles in to work.

Meghan Cully, in contrast, puts in a full day’s work before hitting the gym on her way home. The 32-year-old graphic designer from Maryland is a self-described “slow starter” in the mornings and finds it difficult to get moving early in the day.

Each gets their workout, but is one time of day better than the other?

Consider your fitness goals

A small study out of Skidmore College examined the benefits of morning versus evening exercise for both women and men. Paul J. Arciero, Ph.D., professor for health and human physiological sciences department at Skidmore, was the lead investigator.

“We had the groups follow the same multi-modal routine, randomly dividing them into evening and morning groups,” he says. “We found women and men respond differently to different types of exercise depending on the time of day, which surprised us.”

The study revealed that for women who want to lower blood pressure or reduce belly fat, morning exercise works best. Those women striving for upper body muscle gains, endurance, or overall mood improvement should consider evening workouts.

For the male participants, the findings were somewhat flipped: Evening exercise lowers blood pressure, the risk of heart disease, and feelings of fatigue, while similar to women, they burn more fat with morning exercise. To understand the reasons behind the results, additional research is required.

What might be most ideal, then, says Arciero, is adjusting your workouts to the time of day when you can get the most bang for your buck. “If you’re a female, then, you might want to perform your cardio workouts in the morning, and your strength training in the evening,” he says.

Early birds versus night owls

“For many people, [the best time to exercise] will depend on their chronotype,” says Jennifer J. Heisz, Ph.D., associate professor of kinesiology at McMaster University and author of Move the Body, Heal the Mind.

Chronotype is your body’s natural inclination to sleep at a certain time—it’s what determines whether you’re a night owl or an early bird. For the 25% of the population that considers themselves a night owl, getting both enough sleep and enough exercise can be difficult, says Heisz.

“Exercising at night can sometimes be challenging with societal norms,” she explains. “You might naturally stay up until midnight and exercise late at night, but if you have to be out the door the next morning at 7, you’re not getting enough sleep.”

Sleep–which provides your body the necessary time to recover and make gains from exercise–should always be a priority when it comes to exercise. Regardless of research on the benefits of certain exercises at particular times of the day, your results will be diminished if it doesn’t allow enough time for sleep.

How to shift your workout time

If your goal is to change up your routine to adhere to Arciero’s findings related to exercise time of day, or simply to make exercise more convenient even if it runs against your chronotype, Heisz says it’s possible.

“If you’d like to shift to a morning routine, for instance, the good news is that both the sun and exercise can reset your biological cues,” she says. “Put them together by exercising outside in the sunshine, and it’s a powerful effect.”

For older adults, whose tendency is to sometimes awaken too early and not fall back to sleep, the desired shift might be to evening exercise. “This might help with falling asleep later and staying asleep longer,” says Heisz.

If you’re worried that evening workouts will impact your ability to fall asleep, shift your workouts to gentler forms of exercise, like yoga. Avoid vigorous exercise like running, which might elevate your heart rate and make it tougher to wind down.

For evening exerciser Cully, the trick is working out on the way home from work, which is spaced far enough from bedtime not to impact her sleep. “If I went home first, I probably wouldn’t exercise,” she admits. “But then I have my whole evening to wind down.”

No matter when you prefer to exercise, what’s most important, according to Arciero, is including a multi-modal approach. For his study, Arciero developed a program that does just that, called RISE—resistance training, sprint interval training, stretching, and endurance. “We found that when doing each type of exercise once a week, compliance was higher and so was the benefit,” he explains.

Business Daily,https://www.businessdailyafrica.com/bd/lifestyle/profiles/francis-gitau-architect-who-died-before-steering-family-bank--4667404,24.06.24,02:00:00 UTC,Francis Gitau: Architect who died before steering Family Bank to attain the goal of becoming tier-1 lender,"Few people have graduated from being bank customers to being directors. But such is the story of architect Francis Gitau Mungai, who died last week, hardly a month into his appointment as the chairperson of Family Bank. He died after a brief illness while undergoing treatment in the United States.

Mr Mungai, whose pastime activities were Karate and swimming, according to his LinkedIn post, started his three-decade relationship with Family Bank in 1996 as its customer.

He started off in the banking hall back when Family Bank was still a building society. He was also the financial institution’s architect. He would help the Family Finance Building Society, as Family Bank was known, before being converted into a commercial lender in 2007, together with its members, build houses.

While he continued with his architecture career, his appointment as the chairperson of Family Bank meant he was not only going to design buildings; he was also overseeing the design of new financial products and guiding the bank through its long-term goal of becoming a tier-one bank.

After all, because they are naturally drawn to complex problems demanding creative solutions, architects tend to make good product managers.

Because its long-term goal is to become a tier-one bank, Family Bank issued 800 million new shares through a rights issue.

He would gradually move from the lender’s banking hall into its boardroom 10 years later, becoming among the few architects who sit on the board of a financial institution.

The seasoned architect had barely served a month since he was appointed Family Bank’s chairperson when he died, leaving behind a leadership vacuum on the lender’s board.

He had replaced long-serving chairperson Wilfred Kiboro, who was retiring.

“Prior to joining the board, Arch Mungai had supported the bank both as a customer and as an architect since 1996,” said Family Bank company secretary Eric Murai.

“He made invaluable contributions to the growth of the bank, and he will be missed immensely by all those who had the pleasure of knowing him.”

Mungai joined Family Bank’s board in 2016, serving as the vice chairperson for the last two years before his recent appointment.

Mr Mungai joined the board after replacing Dr Kabiru Kinyanjui, who resigned on March 31, 2015, after serving the bank for 14 years. The board appointed Mungai on June 11, 2015, to fill in the casual vacancy, which he served until the next annual general meeting.

He also chaired the Board of Credit Committee and the Board of Human Resources Committee. He was also a member of the Nominations and Governance Committee and a director of Pesa Pap Digital Limited, a subsidiary of Family Bank.

Normally, a building society will offer, among other banking services, mortgages to its members, which explains the relationship that Mungai, who also had a stake in Family Bank, had with the mid-sized lender. His work was to design homes, which explains why he ended up with the Family Building Society.

Mr Gitau held a Master’s Degree in Architecture and Urban Design from the University of California, Los Angeles, and a Bachelor of Architecture degree from the University of Nairobi.

He was also a fellow of the Architectural Association of Kenya and is registered by the Board of Registration of Architects & Quantity Surveyors in Kenya. He was the founding partner of Aaki Consultants, Architects, and Urban Designers, and worked as an architect with prominent firms like Triad Architects in Nairobi and Urban Innovation Group in Los Angeles.

At one point, he was the chairman of the Board of the National Housing Corporation, where he had previously served as a director.

He had been a chairman of various bodies, such as the Architectural Association of Kenya, and the Kenya Private Sector Alliance, where he was director and chairman of the Building and Infrastructure Board.

He was also at some point a lecturer at the University of Nairobi, Architecture and Building Sciences Department, where he focused on both Architectural and Urban Design Studies, as well as Professional Practice and Management.

Family Bank was founded by Titus K. Muya, also known as TK Muya. He envisioned the bank in 1961 and brought it to life in 1984.

On its website, Family Bank Kenya says it has a history of serving the underbanked population, dating back to its founding in 1984.

Established as Family Finance Building Society Limited, it was aimed to be the go-to financial institution for the unbanked majority ignored by mainstream banks. This included small businesses, farmers, and government employees.

By 2005, the Society had over 30 branches nationwide. In 2007, it received a license from the Central Bank of Kenya and officially became a commercial bank - Family Bank Limited. Founder Titus Muya stepped down as CEO to comply with regulations.

Since becoming a bank, Family Bank has focused on expanding its branch network. They currently have over 90 branches and are one of the largest banks serving the mass market in Kenya. They were also the first in Kenya to introduce paperless banking through smart card technology.","He would help the Family Finance Building Society, as Family Bank was known, before being converted into a commercial lender in 2007, together with its members, build houses.

Business Daily,https://www.businessdailyafrica.com/bd/corporate/companies/banks-to-get-up-to-3-years-to-meet-sh10bn-capital-threshold--4667564,24.06.24,02:00:00 UTC,Banks to get up to 3 years to meet Sh10bn capital threshold,"Commercial banks will be given up to three years to raise their minimum capital tenfold to Sh10 billion, kicking off a period of consolidation or share offers in Kenya’s banking sector.

The Central Bank of Kenya (CBK) is set to shortly start seeking stakeholder input on the proposed higher capital requirement, which is expected to protect lenders against risks and bolster them for regional expansion.

The recapitalisation move will pose challenges to 24 or more than half 39 licensed commercial banks in Kenya, especially the small and mid-sized. ""Obviously (the transition) can't be one year, so it will probably be up to three years. Many of the banks already have Sh10 billion in core capital. There will also be quite a number of banks with the ability to generate additional capital either from their shareholders which will be enough to meet the Sh10 billion requirement within the three years,” CBK Governor Kamau Thugge said in an interview last week.

“We have not adjusted the core capital requirements in many years, and during that time, we have had all kinds of new risks emerging such as cybersecurity and climate issues. There is also competition from foreign banks coming here and becoming very aggressive. As we plan to become a financial hub, we need strong banks that can withstand the new risks.”

Kenya currently requires a minimum capital of Sh1 billion for those who wish to start a bank. The higher capital requirement could see some lenders choosing to downgrade their banking licences.

Banks that are already operating are required to maintain 10.5 percent core capital to total risk-weighted assets, and 14.5 percent total capital to risk-weighted assets.

Spire Bank (acquired by Equity Bank in 2023), Consolidated Bank, First Community Bank (now Premier Bank) and Access Bank Kenya had the lowest core capital of the 24 banks at the end of 2022.

In the period, the banking industry closed with a total core capital haul of Sh809 billion against Sh6.5 trillion in the sector’s total assets.

The CBK has welcomed mergers and acquisitions as a solution to the looming capital dash, with the Governor seeing fewer but better-capitalised banks as the ideal scenario.

The banking industry is no stranger to mergers and acquisitions, the latest deal having come in June last year when Shorecap III, LP- a Mauritian based private equity fund acquired Credit Bank Plc.

The industry’s last merger was in September 2019 when NIC Group and Commercial Bank of Africa combined to form NCBA Bank Kenya Plc.

Despite consolidation being on the cards, Dr Thugge says the CBK will not enforce mergers or acquisitions even as he views consolidation in the industry as favourable.

“Mergers and acquisitions will be encouraged but we will allow it to play out within the banks. Unless we are asked to be intermediate, I really don’t see the need for forcing mergers outside of setting the target for core capital,” he added.

Equally, the CBK does not see concentration risks emerging from consolidation, arguing that having bigger banks will enhance competition, which could trigger a lowering of bank charges and costs.

“There still will be quite a number of banks. I think the concentration will not mean just five or 10 large banks. For the purposes of competitiveness, having bigger banks enhances competition. Right now, if you have so few large banks, they kind of set the stage and smaller banks just follow,” said Dr Thugge.

An increased capital base is seen as important for financial sector stability and is normally expected to lead to cost reductions from economies of scale. This marks the second attempt in a decade to revise the minimum capital threshold for lenders.

A similar proposal in 2015, which sought to raise the capital requirement to Sh5 billion, was rejected by Parliament.

The Sh1 billion minimum capital requirement has been in force since 2012 and lags the standards set by other major African banking markets.","Many of the banks already have Sh10 billion in core capital.

TVETs form a key part of President William Ruto's economic blueprint aimed at unlocking jobs for the youth through technical skills.

“The Office of the Auditor-General invites sealed tender for the provision of audit services for audits of the TVETs on behalf of the Office of the Auditor-General for the financial year 2022-2023. The TVETs have been grouped and clustered into 27 lots,” Auditor-General Nancy Gathungu said in a tender call.

The audits are expected to shed light on how more than 2,000 TVET colleges across the country spent Sh23.9 billion that was allocated to them in the 2022/23 fiscal year, out of the Sh24.16 billion that was allocated to the State Department for Vocational and Technical Training.

Treasury, during the year, allocated Sh3.8 billion for infrastructure development and expansion across TVETs, Sh18.8 billion for technical trainers and instructor services, and Sh1 billion for technical accreditation and quality assurance.

This financial year, the government has allocated Sh28.3 billion to TVET institutions.

The State Department planned to implement several projects during the year, including the completion of the construction of Nyandarua Hospitality Complex Block, Kaiboi Science & Engineering Complex, Ugunja, Gichugu, Kieni, and Magarini technical training institutes.","The Auditor-General has invited private firms to audit Technical and Vocational Education Training (TVET) colleges, to shed light on how Sh24 billion pumped into the institutions in the year to June 2023 was spent.

Business Daily,https://www.businessdailyafrica.com/bd/markets/capital-markets/international-market-economists-see-shilling-weakening-to-145--4667116,24.06.24,01:00:00 UTC,International market economists see shilling weakening to 145 levels,"Economists working with leading global banks, consultancies, and think tanks now see the shilling weakening at a slower pace than earlier projected on improved investor sentiment.

The analysts now project the Kenyan currency will close the year at an average of 144 units against the greenback, stronger than 162 levels three months earlier.

The shilling has since mid-February benefitted from the successful issuance of $1.44 billion (about Sh185.8 billion under prevailing conversion rates) Eurobond to pay a large portion of largely $2 billion (Sh258 billion) debt maturing today (June 24), helping calm nerves of foreign investors over a sovereign default.

Further support has come from elevated base interest rates, currently at 13 percent, raising returns for Kenya’s asset classes such as Treasury bonds, hence attracting foreign portfolio investors who bring in dollars.

The country has also benefitted from increased flows from diaspora wiring cash back home, besides new external debt from multilateral lenders such as the World Bank Group.

Central Bank of Kenya Governor Kamau Thugge, for example, announced earlier in the months that East Africa’s most advanced economy would tap part of the World Bank’s $1.2 billion (Sh154.8 billion) to pay back the last batch of the debut Eurobond, estimated at $500 million (Sh64.5 billion).

“The successful sale of foreign-currency-denominated bonds in mid-February has lessened the risk of default and supported the shilling against the USD recently,” analysts at Barcelona-based FocusEconomics wrote in a June 2024 outlook report based on feedback from panellists drawn from nine firms.

The shilling has gained about 20 percent over the US dollar since hitting record levels of 160.75 levels and has oscillated between 133 and 128 levels on average since April.

The currency is, however, forecasted to come under some fresh pressure in the coming months on the expected narrowing of the gap between interest rates in Kenya and the US.

“The KES [shilling] will weaken from current levels by year-end on a narrowing positive interest rate differential with the US Fed (Federal Reserve or the central bank of the US),” FocusEconomics analysts wrote in the June report. “FocusEconomics panellists see the shilling ending 2024 at KES 144 per USD and ending 2025 at Sh 150 per USD.”

If the forecast comes to pass, the shilling could depreciate by about 11 percent from last week’s average levels of about 129 by the end of the year.

Economists at Standard Chartered Bank [of UK] are the most bullish about the shilling among the panelists covered by FocusEconomics. StanChart sees the shilling exchanging at 134 units against the greenback, followed by America’s Citigroup Global Markets at 135 levels.

Analysts at Oxford Economics expect the local unit to trade at 136 units by end of the year, Fitch Solutions at Sh140 per US dollar, Capital Economics (145 units), HSBC of London (150 units), Economist Intelligence Unit (150 units), Nigeria’s Vetiva Capital (152 units)and Fitch Ratings (156 units).

A depreciating shilling raises the cost of goods in a net import economy, putting pressure on overall inflation.

Kenya’s inflation, a measure of the increase in the cost of goods and services over the previous year, edged up slightly in May to 5.1 percent from 5.0 percent a month earlier.

Inflation has averaged 5.8 percent in the first five months of the year.

FocusEconomics panelists expect some slight pressure on prices to average 6.1 percent by the end of the year, a softer growth than the 7.7 percent average for last year.","Economists working with leading global banks, consultancies, and think tanks now see the shilling weakening at a slower pace than earlier projected on improved investor sentiment.

Last week’s Gen Z protests brought woke-ism to Kenya in the most incredibly fascinating way. In case you are the only visitor in Jerusalem who doesn’t know about the peaceful protests last week, I cannot help you. Let your fingers do the walking for you and find your way to the social media virtual realm because that is where all the action is happening. The issue that should have any organisational leaders worried today is that while we were watching the peaceful protests on the streets of various towns in the country, the real violence was happening off the streets and in a virtual realm.

Earlier this month, the telephone numbers of politicians and public figures were leaked online and circulated widely with tips being openly shared online on what damage could be done with this kind of information. The tongue-in-cheek advice did not stop there as the online warriors had nothing but time and online street smarts going for them so they dug up history. One politician, whose rise to fame was as a mid 1990s comedian specialising in political parody, trashed the protests as being fake. Before you could say redykulass, a clip from the politician’s 90 show was shared online juxtaposed to his parliamentary claims of fakeness. The clip was one of his classical parodies on the buffoonery of politicians at the time. The internet never forgets.

Another nominated senator who famously campaigns for women’s right to feminine hygiene products decided to go after a “blogger’ who shared her number and had him arrested for breach of data privacy. She herself had posted her own number on a social media platform a day before as she corralled support for her campaign, asking people to keep calling and keep texting her.

Having been “awokened” to the fact that she had posted her number already, she quickly deleted her own post. Before you could spell “Always”, keyboard warriors had already taken screenshots of the post and proceeded to call out her hypocrisy by sharing the screenshots widely. Because the internet never forgets.

A first-term member of parliament who is a successful entrepreneur that ran and won on an independent ticket decided to vote yes to the Finance Bill last Thursday. The list of all the MPs who voted yes was in circulation on social media faster than you can say sportpesa. The keyboard warriors went to work, whipping up a boycott frenzy of businesses associated with him including a popular nightclub. Someone pulled up a tweet from two years ago where his spouse was congratulating him at his MP swearing-in ceremony and asked the spouse a difficult question about her choices. Because the internet never forgets.

YouTube and TikTok have democratised the content creation space by providing free platforms for absolutely anyone to take a video on a phone and publish it to the world. Careers have been created for anyone who is skilled enough to read the room and know how to entertain, educate or just inform. And the same platforms create the space for these content creators to monetise their creativity through the sharing of advertising revenue.

What the Gen Z have managed to do in a short time is to wake us all up to what the true democratising power of social media is beyond its informative, educative and entertaining aspects. It can uplift a brand and provide immeasurable props to coffee shops and mosques that give critical aid to injured protestors. It can be weaponised and shoot down a brand faster than a police water cannon falls peaceful protestors on Kenyatta Avenue, Nairobi. It can wrap its supporting arms around felled demonstrators and fund raise for those held in jails or injured in hospitals.","Last week’s Gen Z protests brought woke-ism to Kenya in the most incredibly fascinating way.

Business Daily,https://www.businessdailyafrica.com/bd/corporate/companies/posta-to-proceed-with-e-clearing-tender--4667100,24.06.24,01:00:00 UTC,Posta to proceed with e-clearing tender,"The Public Procurement Administrative Review Board has directed the Postal Corporation of Kenya (PCK) to proceed with a multi-million tender for an e-clearing and forwarding platform and last-mile cargo delivery system.

This was after the board dismissed a request for review submitted by Greenworld Big Data Ltd, whose bid was knocked out at the preliminary stage for not meeting the mandatory requirement.

The board chaired by George Murugu dismissed the request questioning the circumstances under which the firm obtained confidential information concerning the subject tender, which it relied on in challenging the tender.

Fintech Edge Ltd, which quoted a bid price of Sh439 million and a proposal of a 50:50 revenue-sharing formula with PCK, won the tender.

“The respondents are hereby directed to proceed with the procurement proceedings for tender No. PCK/PROC/27/2023/2024 E-clearing and Forwarding Platform, E-Integrated Warehousing, and last-mile cargo delivery System,” the board said.

Greenworld Big Data Ltd was disqualified at the preliminary stage being non-compliant with mandatory requirements requiring a bidder to have financial inclusion capability that provides access to the e-payment solution through USSD and a license from the Communication Authority of Kenya (CAK).

“We find and hold that the instant request for review as filed is based on confidential information and documents which were illegally obtained thus rendering it fatally defective and incompetent,” the board said.

PCK invited bids for the tender, whose deadline was March 7, 2024.

At the close of the bids, four companies had submitted their bids including Kobby Technologies Ltd, Fintech Edge Ltd, Greenworld Big Data Ltd, and Tiba Freight Forwarders Ltd.

After conducting an evaluation, two of the tenders- including Greenworld Big Data Ltd- were determined to be non-responsive and two other tenders were cleared to proceed to the next stage.

At the financial evaluation, Kobby Technologies quoted a Sh2.08 billion bid price while Fintech Edge Ltd quoted Sh439 million and proposed a 50:50 percent revenue sharing formula.

The evaluation committee picked Fintech Edge Ltd as the best suitable bidder and recommended it for revenue-sharing negotiations.

The negotiation committee report dated April 29, 2024, agreed on 50:50 percent gross revenue, which will be subject to review after three years on request by either party.

However, Greenworld Big Data Ltd challenged the recommendation on May 15 and asked the board to compel PCK to repeat the process.

The board was informed that its bid was rejected in a biased, improper, and unfair manner since it submitted a partnership agreement with Safaricom, a holder of a CAK license.

PCK opposed the request arguing that both expression of interest and request for proposal stated clearly that it was a mandatory requirement for a tenderer to be in business for the last two years and must provide a certified copy of its incorporation and CR12.

The board was informed that Greenworld Big Data Ltd’s tender was found non-responsive from the expression of interest stage having not attained the minimum mandatory requirement of having been in business for more than two years.

The firm, the board heard, could not proceed to the technical evaluation stage, let alone be declared the successful bidder.

Posta further said it could not rely on Safaricom documents as the telco was not a bidder in a joint venture with Greenworld Big Data Ltd.","The Public Procurement Administrative Review Board has directed the Postal Corporation of Kenya (PCK) to proceed with a multi-million tender for an e-clearing and forwarding platform and last-mile cargo delivery system.

Business Daily,https://www.businessdailyafrica.com/bd/corporate/companies/kenya-taps-un-to-develop-one-stop-online-investor-shop--4667048,24.06.24,01:00:00 UTC,Kenya taps UN to develop one-stop e-investor shop,"Kenya plans a single online portal on which foreign investors will apply and register nearly all business permits in reforms to improve the business climate for new firms and ease regulatory costs.

The United Nations Conference on Trade and Development (Unctad) says it is developing an online platform that will integrate business registration systems at national and county levels on behalf of Kenya Investment Authority (Keninvest).

The Unctad-led Kenya Investment Single Window project is expected to be a one-stop online platform for investors seeking to set up shops in Kenya.

“The system will connect with existing government databases such as the eCitizen portal [for business registration], the Kenya Revenue Authority’s iTax system, and county government portals,” Unctad said in its newly published World Investment Report 2024. “This integration will enhance the functionality of existing platforms, making it easier for businesses to navigate the regulatory environment.”

Keninvest currently runs a one-stop, in-person shop that helps foreigners register their firms and directors for taxation, and get their firms connected to electricity and workers to get work permits.

The services offered at KenInvest do not, however, include crucial permits and licences at the county levels since the systems are not integrated.

Investors have to further separately apply for other crucial permits such as environmental impact assessment approvals from the National Environment Management Authority.

“Although some applications can be completed online, the lack of integration among systems adds significant barriers for investors and entrepreneurs,” UNCTAD says. “There is a pressing need for enhanced facilitation to elevate investment levels sufficiently to address interconnected economic, health, security and climate challenges.”

The system will further boost KenInvest’s capacity to register investment projects online, collect data, or provide effective investor aftercare services, enabling the investment facilitation agency to monitor and support “successful investment outcomes”.

This has come at a time when surveys have suggested that increasing and overlapping compliance costs are forcing entrepreneurs to abandon investment plans, thus weakening healthy competition in some sectors.

Businesses have over the years complained of overlapping regulatory requirements at national and county levels for driving up operating costs. Some agencies perform overlapping and duplicative roles, they claim.

Generally, companies in Kenya need nearly 20 permits and licences to comply with various regulatory requirements, but this varies depending on the nature of the business.

Some of the permits businesses need to comply with include those on business registration and licensing, calibration, premise safety, environmental standards, food and beverages processing, waste management as well as water and sewerage rules.

Others are noise and vibration licenses, construction regulations, cess requirements, specialised materials certificates, controlled substance regulation as well as conservancy fees.

Some of the regulatory pain points for manufacturers include business registration and licensing where investors have to pay fees to Business Registration Service (BRS) and the counties.

The firms have also cited overlapping duplicative roles performed by the Kenya Bureau of Standards (KEBS), NEMA, and the Department of Weights and Measures in approving standards, labels, and calibrations for products.

Other State agencies the firms say perform overlapping mandates are the Directorate of Occupational Safety and Health Services (DOSH), National Construction Authority, Nema, and counties in approving premise safety and health regulations.

“The excessive red tape and compliance requirements imposed by labour laws, tax regulations, and other legal obligations result in increased expenses for businesses. These additional costs can be a burden to both large and small businesses, making it difficult for them to compete in the market,” Kenya Association of Manufacturers wrote in the Manufacturing Priority Agenda 2024.","The United Nations Conference on Trade and Development (Unctad) says it is developing an online platform that will integrate business registration systems at national and county levels on behalf of Kenya Investment Authority (Keninvest).

High Court judge Jairus Ngaah ruled that he was not satisfied that the decision by the Public Procurement Administrative Board (PPRB), dismissing its request for review, was tainted.

The PPARB dismissed Sicpa’s request for review on April 30.

The firm argued that Kebs introduced a criteria on eligibility, which it deemed offensive and discriminatory as it was fashioned to lock it out of the procurement process.

Sicpa argued that section III-Evaluation and Qualification Criteria, which stated that a “tenderer or of its associate must not have been convicted or paid any fines anywhere in the world, directly or indirectly for any irregularities regarding government contracts such as bribery or organisational deficiency”, was deliberately placed in the tender document with the sole intention of disqualifying it from the job to print special stickers.

But Justice Ngaah said there was nothing in the Board’s decision that suggests that it did not correctly understand the law that regulates its decision-making power and that it did not give effect to it.

“The respondent’s (PPRB) decision cannot also be said to be so outrageous in its defiance of logic or of accepted moral standards that no sensible person who had applied his mind to the question to be decided could have arrived at it. Again, there is nothing to suggest that there was any procedural impropriety in the process of reaching the respondent’s decision,” the judge said.

Sicpa informed the court that Kebs invited bids for the provision of standardisation mark stickers on March 24, 2024.

However, the procuring entity deliberately manipulated and edited the tender document with the sole intention of disqualifying it from the tender.","Swiss firm Sicpa SA has failed in its bid to quash some clauses in a Kenya Bureau of Standards (Kebs) tender that were allegedly unfairly used to lock it out of a tender for the provision of standardisation mark stickers.

Daniel Kiptoo, Director General of the Energy and Petroleum Regulatory Authority (Epra) said the government has agreed to the proposal to lift curbs on consumption thresholds and is exploring ways of ensuring that the move does not plunge Kenya Power into losses estimated at Sh25 billion.

“Yes we agreed to the manufacturers’ proposal. We are now computing to see how we will cover for the hit that Kenya Power will take,” Mr Kiptoo said in an interview.

“The proposal by manufacturers is for removal of the six percent threshold in additional consumption for a firm to benefit from the time of use tariff,” he added.

Previously, small commercial and industrial consumers were to meet a monthly consumption threshold tracked every six months, to qualify for the discounted prices known as the Time of Use Tariff (ToU). The tariff was introduced in 2018, discounting prices per unit by up to 50 percent for large consumers using more power during off-peak hours.

Under the ToU, customers pay as low as Sh6.06 per unit of power based on use, allowing small commercial consumers to use over 100 units per month to pay Sh10 per unit instead of Sh20. Bigger consumers are required to use more than 15,000 units a month to pay Sh7.25 per unit instead of Sh15. Manufacturers, however, requested President William Ruto to remove the consumption thresholds that large commercial and industrial firms must meet to enjoy the lower tariff during off-peak hours.

Officials of the Kenya Private Sector Association (Kepsa) confirmed that the government has agreed to their push.

“The government has agreed and committed to our proposal, but we are not sure whether it was to start in June or July,” said Jaswinder Bedi, chairman of the Kepsa board.

The state's decision will see manufacturers enjoy reduced operational costs in the coming months, given that electricity is one of the single biggest bill items on their books.","The State has scrapped consumption limits that industrialists must attain to qualify for preferential electricity prices during nighttime, yielding to pressure from manufacturers.

Business Daily,https://www.businessdailyafrica.com/bd/economy/kerosene-use-dips-39-percent-on-record-prices--4667028,24.06.24,01:00:00 UTC,Kerosene use dips 39 percent on record prices,"Kerosene consumption fell by 39.45 per cent to 69.53 million litres last year the sharpest drop among all the three categories of petroleum products hurt by record-high prices that left poor households chocking.

Data by the Energy and Petroleum Regulatory Authority (Epra) shows that kerosene uptake fell from 114.84 million litres in 2022--highlighting the impact of the financial sting that low-income homes took from the hard economic times during the period.

Kerosene is mainly used by low-income households in Kenya for cooking and lighting and upward price movements have a direct impact on the affordability of the product.

Market figures show that prices of kerosene rose by the highest margin in 2023 to close the year at Sh199.05 a litre in Nairobi, up from Sh145.94 at the start of the period.

Epra data says consumption of petrol and diesel was also affected in 2023. Consumption of petrol fell by 4.76 per cent to two billion litres last year compared to 2.1 billion in 2022 while that of diesel dropped 4.46 per cent to 2.57 billion litres from 2.69 billion litres in the same period.

The drop came in the period when pump prices jumped by between Sh35 and Sh53 per litre between January and December last year, sending fuel prices past the Sh200-a-litre mark for the first time in Kenya’s history.

A litre of super petrol closed the year at Sh212.36, a Sh35.06 rise from the Sh177.30 at start of the year while that of diesel retailed at Sh201.47-- a Sh39.47 rise from Sh162 in the same period.

A combination of factors including doubling of the value-added tax on petroleum products to 16 per cent in June 2023, fast weakening shilling against the dollar and increases in prices of refined fuel globally sent local pump prices skyrocketing.

The shilling exchanged at 158.81 units to the dollar in December last year compared to 133.98 units at the start of the year.

Last year’s fuel consumption levels mirrored patterns of 2020 when travel restrictions enforced to curb the spread of the Coronavirus cut demand from motorists, businesses, and industries.

Kenyans throughout last year grappled with the skyrocketing cost of living amid increased taxation that thinned the amount of disposable income. Increased taxation in the form of higher deductions for the National Social Security Fund, National Health Insurance Fund, and housing levy that hit the monthly earnings of salaried workers.","Kerosene consumption fell by 39.45 per cent to 69.53 million litres last year the sharpest drop among all the three categories of petroleum products hurt by record-high prices that left poor households chocking.

Business Daily,https://www.businessdailyafrica.com/bd/lifestyle/health-fitness/ovarian-insufficiency-when-ovaries-take-an-early-retirement--4667312,24.06.24,00:30:00 UTC,Ovarian insufficiency: When ovaries take an early retirement,"Female reproductive potential is reliant on a well-choreographed and complex developmental maturation of the ovaries at puberty. This is defined as a period when secondary sexual characteristics are observed including breast development, pubic and axillary hair growth and the start of menstruation.

This process is marked by cyclic hormonal changes resulting in menstruation every four to six weeks. Socially and biologically, this represents fertility and vitality.

The ovaries produce two important products, reproductive hormones and eggs. Female hormones, mainly oestrogen and progesterone maintain normal functioning of the uterus, breast development, bone and heart health.

The release of an egg during ovulation defines fertility. These functions progressively decline over time, till menopause when the release of the hormones and eggs ceases, marking the end of reproduction.

How common is this problem?

Generally, on average most women will enter menopause aged 50. The classical symptoms being irregular periods until they stop, hot flushes, fatigue and mood fluctuations.

This age pattern is not uniform and a small proportion of women experience similar symptoms prior to their 40th birthday. Medically it is referred to as premature ovarian insufficiency, previously known as premature menopause. Given the crucial role of the ovary in reproduction and other biological processes, premature ovarian insufficiency poses a great burden.

About one in 100 women go through premature ovarian insufficiency. The causes are varied and include surgery or chemotherapy for cancer, infections such as mumps or genetic conditions like Turner's syndrome. However, most of the cases have no known cause.

Diagnosis

Whereas irregular menstrual periods are a very common occurrence, doctors usually recommend tests to check ovarian function. These include a hormone profile and pelvic ultrasound scan. It may be necessary to repeat the hormone profile after three months to be certain of the diagnosis. More advanced tests such as genetic testing require referral to a specialist.

Management

When premature ovarian insufficiency is diagnosed, management focuses on various areas of health including fertility, hormone replacement, quality of life and psychological support. The primary doctor is the liaison person to ensure the woman gets a comprehensive assessment and plan for ongoing care.

It is useful that hormone replacement is continued until age 50 when reassessment is made for the need to continue. Fertility is an emotive issue and early referral to a specialist will help the woman to navigate through the complex web of options. It may feel like going on a roller-coaster, in which case support and counselling cannot be understated.

As a woman, what should I do?

When you find yourself in circumstances that could predispose you to premature ovarian insufficiency such as cancer treatment, it is recommended you consult a fertility specialist who will provide the opportunity to discuss fertility preservation. This may include harvesting of eggs to preserve on ice in frozen condition for future use. It is a safe and efficient technique with several thousand babies born healthy in recent years.","Medically it is referred to as premature ovarian insufficiency, previously known as premature menopause.

Wolfgang Tolle, who served as an assistant depot at the company, was dismissed following the theft of a truck on the night of November 23, 2017.

His tribulations began on December 8, 2017, when he was suspended from work to allow a probe into the matter. Investigations by the company found that there were lapses in the operation procedures authorised by Mr Tolle, resulting in theft.

Their report claimed that the lapses included loading of stocks past the stipulated time, authorising parking inventory overnight, authorising parking of a vehicle at a venue not designated by the employer, and failure to enable enhanced features of the tracker, to ensure real-time notifications.

The manager was fired on December 20, 2017, on the basis of the investigation report, prompting a court fight that ended in Mr Tolle’s favour.

Employment and Labour Relations Court Judge James Rika ruled that the ex-manager was unfairly dismissed without a fair hearing. “There is no evidence that the respondent was alive to its disciplinary hearing and pre-termination requirements, in the process leading to termination of the Claimant’s contract. There is no evidence of a disciplinary hearing, as contemplated by Section 41 and 45 of the Employment Act,” the Judge said.

“There is no evidence of a pre-termination interview, a procedure that is self-imposed by the Respondent. There was no letter to show cause, issued to the Claimant” Justice Rika added.

Court filings showed that Hass alleged that an email sent on December 20, 2017, by one Justin Nyaga Njiru, to one Abdirizak Sheikh, constituted minutes of the hearing.

The e-mail simply states that a disciplinary hearing meeting was held. It then goes on to make reference to the committee’s findings and resolutions. It is stated that the committee recommended the immediate termination of Mr Tolle’s contract on account of negligence and questionable integrity.

“The email can hardly pass for minutes of a disciplinary hearing. There is no record of specific charges read out to the Claimant. There is no record of who composed the disciplinary committee, what evidence was received, whether there were witnesses and documents in the proceedings” Justice Rika said.","The Employment and Labour Relations Court has found oil marketer Hass Petroleum Kenya Limited guilty of unfairly dismissing a former manager it accused of allegedly abetting the theft of company property.

She may be walking on the street one minute and the next suddenly collapse and slip into a deep slumber.

When it started happening back when she was a primary school pupil, teachers thought her lazy and undisciplined. At that time, Juliet was 13 years old and her teachers also thought that perhaps the sleep menace was a sign she was being overworked by her mother.

“I remember one time I was told to go to the field and run, and go to the tap and wash my face. There were so many scenarios when I remember teachers used to think that I’m probably not getting enough sleep at night, that probably my mom kept me up doing some chores. It was traumatic,” she says.

The social work and community development student says incidents such as falling asleep while walking, coupled with many other scary ones, bothered her mother, who took her to a nearby chemist for consultation.

“We didn’t come to take it seriously until I started to experience other symptoms and my mom took me to a pediatrician. After many tests, I was clinically diagnosed with narcolepsy,” she says.

Narcolepsy, also known as sudden sleep disorder, is a rare life-long disorder of the central nervous system characterized by the brain’s inability to control sleep-wake cycles. People suffering from narcolepsy have sudden sleeps that are managed with medication.

Juliet says because of a lack of awareness, narcoleptics often deal with stigma as some communities mistake the condition for someone who has been bewitched. Juliet says the stigma is like carrying an invisible weight on her shoulders.

“High school was challenging. Some teachers, even when I had explained it to them, were unwilling to accept that I was sick,” she says, adding that one of her worst moments was a time when she found herself dozing off while balancing on a wall.

Raphael Ndungu, an electrical engineer in Utawala estate in Nairobi, is also living with a sleep disorder. His condition made him quit his job.

“I cannot even drive. I was employed, but I decided to opt for self-employment because no employer will be patient enough to watch you constantly sleep at work. I decided to do work that is very involving to avoid falling asleep suddenly. Now I do electrical work.”

When asked if people fear calling him for such a task due to his condition, Raphael says he has to convince them that he will do a perfect job.

“I can’t come and tell you I will work for you and sleep. Perhaps I will tell them that I am not feeling well then I will rest for one or two hours, then come and continue with work because I cannot manage to work the whole day continuously.”

Modify lifestyle

The 36-year-old who has lived with the condition for more than two decades says he has had to modify his lifestyle, including avoiding eating hot meals.

“I have had to put boundaries, especially on what activities to avoid causing danger on my side. I remember there is a time I caused a road accident when my car swerved off the road and hit a tree. That happened because I had not taken the drugs I’d normally take before driving. Since then, I have kept off from driving even motorcycles. I need to be driven in case I am travelling with my car.”

James Ngare, a seasoned trader at Nyamakima who deals with mobile phone accessories, says misdiagnosis took a toll on his career and made him spend months trying to cope with a problem he didn’t fully understand.

“By the time I was in campus, I had gone to many hospitals and none of the doctors mentioned narcolepsy. I came to know about narcolepsy in a newspaper when Ann Nduati, the founder of Narcolepsy Africa Foundation, raised the issue because her daughter was suffering from the condition,” he says.

Tough lesson

His misdiagnosis taught him the importance of questioning, and seeking second opinions, especially when it came to something as crucial as health. Just like Juliet, James’ doctors prescribed a drug called Retallin that promotes wakefulness and reduces excessive daytime sleepiness, but he found it was not only very expensive but also not readily available in the local market.

“After taking them (drugs) they had side effects like headache, so even by the time I did away with them I didn’t even tell my parents. The only cure that is there for narcolepsy is accepting yourself and making people around you know what you’re going through.”

Narcolepsy onset

While narcolepsy can affect people of any age, symptoms always start in childhood to early adulthood, roughly from ages 7 to 25.

Maryanne Nyambura, an advocate for narcolepsy at the Narcolepsy Africa Foundation, says her journey hasn’t been easy, but it has made her help others understand and navigate the complexities of this condition.

“I didn’t know it was a condition until the doctor diagnosed it. So whenever I go to a new place, during introduction, I always have that disclaimer: ‘If you see me dozing off or probably falling asleep, it’s not because you’re boring or I’m disinterested in what you are doing, but it’s because I have this condition. My brain does not function the way a typical normal brain should. So yeah, my brain is unable to regulate the sleep and wake patterns.’”

By just describing the condition, she says, it minimises the chances of people misjudging her.

“That’s how I found myself doing the advocacy things,” she says of the journey that traces back to her high school days when she got her diagnosis.

Maryanne says she runs awareness campaigns through the use of informational materials, online resources, and social media platforms to dispel misconceptions about narcolepsy.

“Parents DM and ask me to speak to their children, to just give them that word of hope because they see I’ve ‘made it.’ But it’s a daily struggle.”

Employee assistance

The 27-year-old software designer urges employers to consider implementing employee assistance programs for narcoleptic employees that cater to mental and physical health, thus boosting productivity and overall well-being.

Anthony Muli, the CEO of Entice Africa Safaris and Maryanne’s employer, says creating a workplace that accommodates and supports employees with narcolepsy not only enhances their quality of life but also strengthens the bonds of their team.

“We only have this one employee with this condition and my team understands her condition. They always check up on her during the day and in the morning, in the evening, wherever they move together, to make sure she’s safe,” he says.

Prevalence

Data from the Centre for Narcolepsy at Stanford University estimates that narcolepsy affects approximately one in every 2,000 individuals and about 3 million people worldwide. However, medication and lifestyle changes can help manage the symptoms.

Simeon Ochanda, a neurologist at Kenyatta National Hospital, says the diagnosis of narcolepsy is determined from history and by the use of a special machine since some people display abnormal movements such as restless leg syndrome, epilepsies, and seizures during sleep.

“The history of the problem is the way you make the diagnosis. After listening to the patient’s history and noting it down, we have some objective ways of measuring sleep. We call it somnography. You are put in a room and you are connected to electrodes which are fed into this machine that shows the pattern of sleep.”

Other triggers

Dr Ochanda says genetic factors such as hypocretin, also known as orexin, age, and other triggering infections or inflammation play important roles in the development of narcolepsy. It’s essential for individuals experiencing symptoms of narcolepsy to consult with a neurologist since a specific treatment plan will depend on the type and severity of narcolepsy symptoms.

“That diagnosis needs to be made because some causes are treatable. People with hypothyroidism are always tired and sleepy. You diagnose hypothyroidism, it is treatable, and the patient will become okay.”

Dr Ochanda says that even though there are drugs that ensure wakefulness, patients need to have a regular sleeping pattern and good sleeping hygiene.

“Setting a regular sleeping time helps sleep be adequate so that you have enough and you are not disturbed in the daytime. We call it sleep hygiene,” he explains.

Policy steps

Catherine Karegezi, the executive director of the Non-Communicable Diseases Alliance, calls on the government to put more focus on rare diseases such as narcolepsy and find amicable solutions to address them.

“We recently had a forum with SHIF, formerly NHIF, just to explain to us about their social health insurance because that is going to be critical for people living with narcolepsy and other non-communicable diseases, for us to understand what is going to be available in terms of management and treatment of these conditions.”","In a world where sleep is often taken for granted, it is not strange for Juliet Rogito to fall asleep while walking.

(Photo: Jim Allen/FreightWaves)

About 2,000 truck drivers, warehouse and dock workers, and office personnel of Humble, Texas-based U.S. Logistics Solutions (USLS), formerly Forward Air Solutions, say they were blindsided late Thursday when they were notified via conference calls or by text messages that the company was ceasing operations and that they would not receive paychecks Friday.

Eric Culberson, former president of USLS, confirmed the closure in a LinkedIn post on Saturday, stating that thousands of workers were without jobs after the company’s owner, private equity firm Ten Oaks Group, headquartered in Charlotte, North Carolina, shuttered operations.

“Due to the abrupt decision by our private ownership group to close our doors at the same time business was surging, I am completely devastated and heartbroken for the 2000+professionals I’ve had the pleasure of working with,” Culberson wrote. “The timing of this closure did not give me the chance to thank my team for their commitment and support to our customers and to each other.”

Ten Oaks Group has not issued a statement about the closure. Curtis Griner, managing partner and general counsel for Ten Oaks Group, did not respond to FreightWaves’ request seeking comment about when the former USLS workers should expect to receive their final paychecks and paid time off.

At the time of its closure, the company had undergone several rounds of layoffs in the past few months, according to multiple sources familiar with the matter.

USLS, a logistics company that provided last-mile handling and distribution of time-sensitive products, had 500 drivers and 732 power units, according to the Federal Motor Carrier Safety Administration’s SAFER website. The FMCSA database shows the company’s insurance coverage remains active and its safety scores are far below the national averages for both drivers and vehicle inspections. The trucking company had one fatal crash, five injuries and 12 tow-aways over the past 24-month period.

In February 2021, FreightWaves reported that Forward Air was selling its Pool Distribution unit to Ten Oaks Group for $20 million. The unit consisted of $8 million in cash and up to a $12 million earn-out dependent upon financial performance.





According to its website, USLS was Ten Oaks Group’s first transportation acquisition. After acquiring Forward Air Solutions of Greeneville, Tennessee, the firm renamed it USLS and moved its headquarters to Humble.

Some former USLS employees, who spoke to FreightWaves on the condition of anonymity, said they were notified by payroll company ADP about the closure. They also said Ten Oaks Group was struggling to obtain further financing with its lenders, which forced the private equity firm to abruptly close USLS.

Story continues

According to the Texas Workforce Commission website, USLS had not filed a notice of its impending closure prior to closing on Thursday. The company’s website is no longer working.

Employers with more than 100 employees are required to notify workers as part of the federal Worker Adjustment and Retraining Notification (WARN) Act. WARN requires employers to provide their employees with a 60-day notice of a massive layoff.

USLS operated 19 terminals, mainly on the Eastern side of the country, prior to shuttering operations.

Key Takeaways

AI chipmaker Nvidia remains in the spotlight after shares dropped from a record high reached Thursday and news that it will supply Middle Eastern telecommunications giant Ooredoo with its technology.

Thursday’s intraday reversal in Nvidia shares created a bearish engulfing pattern, a candlestick formation that warns of a potential downside reversal, especially after a significant price advance.

Investors may keep an eye on chart levels around $119 and $110, both areas where the stock could find support from minor pullbacks over the past three weeks.







Artificial intelligence (AI) chipmaker Nvidia (NVDA) remains in the spotlight after shares dropped from a record high reached Thursday and news that it will supply Middle Eastern telecommunications giant Ooredoo with its technology.

Despite little in the way of company-specific announcements late last week, investors may have used a rare moment of broad market weakness for profit taking following the stock’s meteoric rise this year amid the AI boom.

Monitor These Levels Amid Bearish Engulfing Pattern

Since finding support around the 50-day moving average in April last year, Nvidia shares have tracked sharply higher, with investors viewing any dips as buying opportunities. However, Thursday’s intraday reversal from their all-time high (ATH) created a bearish engulfing pattern, a candlestick formation that warns of a potential downside reversal, especially after a significant price advance.

If Nvidia’s price continues to retrace this week amid a shift in sentiment, investors may keep an eye on chart levels around $119 and $110, both areas where the stock could find support from minor pullbacks over the past three weeks. A failure to hold these key regions could see the shares revisit a horizontal line near $97 that connects several prior record highs.

Middle Eastern AI Tech Deal

Separately, Nvidia has inked a deal to roll out its AI technology at data centers owned by Qatari multinational telecommunications giant Ooredoo located in five Middle Eastern countries, the Doha-based company’s CEO told Reuters in an interview on Sunday.

While Ooredoo did not disclose the value of the deal, it said it would provide its data center clients in Qatar, Algeria, Tunisia, Oman, Kuwait, and the Maldives with access to Nvidia's AI and graphics processing technology.

""Our business-to-business (B2B) clients, thanks to this agreement, will have access to services that probably their competitors (won't) for another 18 to 24 months,"" said Ooredoo CEO Aziz Aluthman Fakhroo.

The deal comes at a time when U.S. Officials have tightened export controls on advanced U.S. chips to curb China accessing sophisticated AI technology through the Middle East.

Yahoo Finance,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/stocks-face-meager-upside-2024-000002528.html,24.06.24,00:00:02 UTC,"Stocks Face Meager Upside After 2024 Gains, Survey Shows","(Bloomberg) -- The S&P 500 Index has likely logged most of the gains it will see this year as investors are growing increasingly nervous about the stock market’s rich valuations, according to the latest Bloomberg Markets Live Pulse survey.

Most Read from Bloomberg

The 2024 rally, which has driven the US equity benchmark to 31 record closing highs, has left the asset class more overpriced than US credit or gold, a majority of the 586 respondents said. After soaring roughly 50% since October 2022, driven by technology shares, the bull market has delivered a greater advance than the median of its predecessors going back to 1957.

Investors aren’t looking to hit the sell button just yet, but signs of skittishness are evident as about half of survey takers say stocks will see the beginning of a correction of at least 10% this year, with 35% saying that will happen in 2025. That overarching sense of caution is also apparent in the options market, where traders have been building hedges against potential losses in tech stocks.

With the economy and earnings still growing, and ample liquidity sloshing around in the financial system, most poll participants see scope for additional gains this year, but only a modest amount. The survey’s median projection is for the S&P 500 to finish 2024 at 5,606, almost 3% above Friday’s close. That’s a cheerier view than Wall Street strategists’ median target, which is for the index to be little changed from current levels at year-end.

About three quarters of participants say they’ll maintain or boost their exposure to the S&P 500 over the next month. It makes sense to ride the bullish wave for the time being, Ned Davis Research’s Ed Clissold and Thanh Nguyen wrote in a June 20 note. They have doubts, however, as the year goes on, given all the questions investors face in the second half, around all-important areas such Federal Reserve policy and the US elections.“Maintain an overweight position in equities for now,” they wrote. “But prepare for more defensive positioning, potentially in the third quarter.”

As a measure of equities’ lofty valuation, Michael O’Rourke at JonesTrading points to the S&P 500’s market capitalization relative to the size of the economy. Since around 1990, that ratio has only been higher when stocks were surging in 2021.

Story continues

“We are in a bubble and there is an outsized risk that the economy finally slows down in the second half of the year and multiples should contract,” said O’Rourke, the firm’s chief market strategist. “These are very dangerous levels for long-term investors to be buying stocks.”

Artificial intelligence, a key driver of the market’s almost 15% advance this year, is seen as the most likely trigger for a selloff, with 31% of survey respondents on alert for a negative surprise on that front.

Tech stocks in the so-called Magnificent Seven basket — led by AI darling Nvidia Corp. — have dominated profit growth, although in the analysis of Bloomberg Intelligence their influence is likely to wane in the months ahead.

Worries around the economy are also top of mind. Some 27% of poll-takers said stocks could drop as unemployment increases, while almost a quarter pointed to the risk of a surprise pickup in inflation that would keep the Fed on hold for longer.

The jobless rate rose to 4% in May, the highest since early 2022. Goldman Sachs Group Inc. economists warned the job market stands at a potential “inflection point,” where any further softness in demand for workers will hit jobs, not just job openings.

“General economic conditions are confusing,” Kim Forrest, chief investment officer at Bokeh Capital Partners, said via email. “Inflation seems to be subsiding but jobs seem to be slowing down.”

For all the reasons to fret over the months ahead, the survey also contains some potentially rosier signals.

The lop-sided rally in stocks has also created big distortions in the market.

BEIJING (Reuters) - China's ByteDance is working with U.S. chip designer Broadcom (NASDAQ: ) on developing an advanced AI processor, two sources familiar with the matter said, a move that would help TikTok's owner secure sufficient supply of high-end chips amid U.S.-Sino tensions.

The 5 nanometre chip - a customised product known as an application-specific integrated chip (ASIC) - would be compliant with U.S. export restrictions and manufacturing work would be outsourced to Taiwan's TSMC, the sources added.

There have been no publicly announced chip development collaborations between Chinese and U.S. companies involving 5nm or more advanced technology since Washington introduced export controls for cutting-edge semiconductors in 2022. U.S.-China deals in the sector generally concern much less sophisticated tech.

ByteDance's tie-up with Broadcom, an existing business partner, would help slash procurement costs and ensure a stable supply of higher-end chips, said the sources, who declined to be identified due to the sensitivity of semiconductor issues in China.

TSMC is, however, not expected to start manufacturing the new chip this year, they said. One of them said while design work is well underway, the ""tapeout"" - which marks the end of the design phase and the beginning of manufacturing - has not started.

ByteDance and Broadcom did not respond to repeated requests for comment. TSMC declined to comment.

Like many global tech firms, ByteDance has launched a major push in generative artificial intelligence but the company and its Chinese peers have to contend with far more limited supply of AI chips than their overseas counterparts.

Nvidia (NASDAQ: )'s most advanced chipsets are out of reach due to U.S. export controls aimed at impeding breakthroughs in AI and supercomputing by China's military. Competition for U.S. chips developed specifically for the Chinese market as well as those from rival Huawei, one of the few Chinese makers of AI accelerators, is fierce.

ByteDance and Broadcom have been business partners since at least 2022. The Chinese firm has purchased the U.S. company's Tomahawk 5nm high-performance switch chip as well as its Bailly switch for AI computer clusters, Broadcom has said in public statements.

Securing AI chips is crucial for ByteDance to make its algorithms more powerful. In addition to TikTok and the Chinese version of the short-video app called Douyin, ByteDance operates a range of popular apps including a ChatGPT-like chatbot service called Doubao, which has 26 million users.

To support its AI push, ByteDance has stockpiled Nvidia chips, according to a separate person who was briefed on the matter.

This includes A100 and H100 chips available before the first round of U.S. sanctions kicked in as well as A800 and H800 chips that Nvidia made for the China market but were also later restricted, the person said, adding that ByteDance allocated $2 billion for purchases of Nvidia chips last year.

ByteDance also purchased Huawei's Ascend 910B chips last year, two separate sources with knowledge of the matter said.

Bytedance currently has hundreds of semiconductor-related job openings posted, including 15 for ASIC chip designers, according to checks of its website.

It has also been poaching top people from other Chinese AI chip firms, according to one of the sources who has direct knowledge of this issue.","Securing AI chips is crucial for ByteDance to make its algorithms more powerful.

TAIPEI (Reuters) -Democracy is not a crime and autocracy is the real ""evil"", Taiwan President Lai Ching-te said on Monday after China threatened to impose the death penalty in extreme cases for ""diehard"" Taiwan independence separatists.

China, which views Taiwan as its own territory, has made no secret of its dislike of Lai, who took office last month, saying he is a ""separatist"", and staged war games shortly after his inauguration.

On Friday, China ramped up its pressure on Taiwan by issuing new legal guidelines to punish those it says support the island's formal independence, though Chinese courts have no jurisdiction on the democratically governed island.

Asked about China's move at a news conference at the presidential office in Taipei, Lai first reiterated his sympathy for recent flooding in southern China before responding.

""I want to stress: democracy is not a crime; it's autocracy that is the real evil. China has absolutely no right to sanction Taiwan's people just because of the positions they hold. What's more, China has no right to go after Taiwan people's rights across borders,"" he said.

According China, anyone who does not uphold ""reunification"" is therefore a Taiwan independence supporter, Lai added.

""I also want to call on China to face up to the existence of the Republic of China and have exchanges and dialogue with Taiwan's democratically elected, legitimate government,"" he said, using Taiwan's formal name. ""If this is not done, relations between Taiwan and China will only become more and more estranged.""

Taiwan said that since Thursday, there has been a sharp increase in Chinese military flights as Beijing carried out a ""joint combat readiness patrol"" near the island.

Between Thursday and Sunday, Taiwan says it detected 115 Chinese military aircraft operating nearby, getting as close at 31 nautical miles (57 km) from the southern tip of the island.

Taiwan has said that for the past four years China has carried out regular military activity around the island as part of a ""grey zone"" pressure campaign.

Taiwan's annual Han Kuang war games next month will aim to mimic actual combat as closely as possible given a rapidly rising ""enemy threat"" from China, a senior official said.

Lai rejects Beijing's sovereignty claims and says only Taiwan's people can decide their future. He has repeatedly offered talks with China but been rebuffed.

China says any move by Taiwan to declare formal independence would be grounds to attack the island.

The government in Taipei says Taiwan is already an independent country, the Republic of China, and that it does not plan to change that. The Republican government fled to Taiwan in 1949 after losing a civil war with Mao Zedong's Communists.

Lai also faces domestic challenges, as his Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) lost its majority in parliament in the same election in January that brought him to power.

Speaking at the same news conference, Lai said he would ask the constitutional court to stay a package of contested parliament reforms the opposition has passed and consider whether they comply with the constitution.

The opposition says the reforms, which among other things criminalise contempt of parliament by government officials, are needed to bring more accountability, but the DPP says they were forced through without proper discussion.","By Ben BlanchardTAIPEI (Reuters) -Democracy is not a crime and autocracy is the real ""evil"", Taiwan President Lai Ching-te said on Monday after China threatened to impose the death penalty in extreme cases for ""diehard"" Taiwan independence separatists.

SYDNEY (Reuters) -Asia shares slipped on Monday in a countdown for U.S. price data that investors are banking on to show a renewed moderation in inflation, while markets were on alert for possible Japanese intervention as the dollar tested the 160 yen barrier.

Geopolitics also loomed large, with the first U.S. presidential debate on Thursday and the first round of voting in the French election at the weekend.

MSCI's broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan fell 0.9%, after touching a two-year top last week. South Korean stocks fell 0.8%.

and Nasdaq futures were both down around 0.1%. Shares in Boeing (NYSE: ) could face pressure after Reuters reported U.S. prosecutors are recommending criminal charges be brought against the aircraft maker.

EUROSTOXX 50 futures eased 0.2%, while lost 0.3%.

inched up 0.2%, with the continued decline in the yen putting pressure on the Bank of Japan to tighten policy despite patchy domestic data.

Minutes of the central bank's last policy meeting out on Monday showed there was much discussion about tapering its bond buying and raising rates.

Japan's top currency official was out early to voice disapproval with the yen's latest drop which saw the dollar reach as high as 159.94.

The dollar was trading just a shade softer at 159.70, eyeing the 160.245 peak from late April where Japan was thought to have started spending around $60 billion buying the yen.

Demand for carry trades, borrowing yen at low rates to buy higher yielding currencies, has also seen both the Australian and New Zealand dollars reach 17-year peaks on the yen.

PARSING THE PCE

Even the euro was testing recent highs at 170.87 yen, despite being saddled with a round of soft manufacturing surveys (PMI) which left it stuck at $1.0688.

""The decline in the Euro area flash June PMI raises some concern that the nascent rebound is being cut short,"" wrote analysts at JPMorgan in a note.

""The abruptness of the drop is notable against the backdrop of the French election, which was mentioned explicitly by firms as a reason for the drag.""

France's far right National Rally (RN) party and its allies were leading the first round of the country's elections with 35.5% of the vote, according to a poll published on Sunday.

Manufacturing surveys from the United States, in contrast, showed activity at a 26-month high in June, though price pressures still subsided considerably.

The latter shift whetted appetites for the personal consumption expenditures (PCE) price index due on Friday. Annual growth in the Federal Reserve's favoured core index is expected to slow to 2.6% in May, the lowest in more than three years.

""Note that low PCE deflator outcomes are needed to keep the y/y rate from rising through the course of this year given the string of low prints in the second half of 2023,"" cautioned analysts at NAB.

""The Fed is well aware of this as the median dot for end 2024 was 2.8% for PCE, unchanged from its current level and implying average monthly outcomes of 0.18%.""

A low result would likely reinforce market bets on a Fed rate cut as early as September, which futures currently price as a 65% prospect.

There are at least five Fed speakers on the docket this week, including San Francisco Fed President Mary Daly and Fed Governors Lisa Cook and Michelle Bowman.

BRUSSELS (Reuters) -China and the European Commission have agreed to start talks on the planned imposition of tariffs on Chinese-made electric vehicles (EVs) being imported into the European Union, opening the door to potential de-escalation.

The European Commission is planning to impose provisional duties on EVs produced in China ranging from 17.4% to 38.1%, on top of its standard 10% tariff for car imports.

The duties are due to apply by July 4.

WHAT ARE PROVISIONAL MEASURES?

Provisional duties can be imposed within nine months of the start of an EU anti-subsidy investigation if the Commission concludes it needs to prevent injury to EU industry.

They can be applied for a maximum of four months, by which point the Commission will decide whether to apply final duties, known as definitive duties. In the EV case, the deadline for this is Nov. 3.

Provisional duties are only collected if definitive duties are imposed at the end of the investigation. If definitive duties are lower or not applied, then provisional duties are adjusted down accordingly. Until then, customs authorities normally just require a bank guarantee from importers.

The duties can also be applied retroactively for as much as 90 days, so in the EV case from early April, with a decision on this taken at the end of the investigation.

WHAT HAPPENS NEXT?

On June 22, Germany's Economy Minister Robert Habeck said he had been informed by EU commissioner Valdis Dombrovskis that there would be concrete negotiations on the tariffs with China.

""What I suggested to my Chinese partners today is that the doors are open for discussions and I hope that this message was heard,"" Habeck said in Shanghai after meetings with Chinese officials in Beijing.

By July 4, the Commission is due to publish in the EU official journal a lengthy document detailing the ongoing investigation and its findings. The provisional duties will then apply the following day.

Interested parties such as China and EV producers have until July 18 to comment on the findings. They can also request a hearing.

The Commission has already visited more than 100 sites of automakers in China and Europe and done the bulk of its investigation.

Its final report generally reads as a confirmation of its provisional findings, with possible adjustments following comments received.

Definitive duties are often a little lower than the provisional rates, reflecting an acceptance of some of these arguments.

One new element will be Tesla (NASDAQ: )'s request that the Commission calculate a separate duty rate for it.

The largest EV exporter from China to Europe will want to have a lower rate than the 21% for companies that have cooperated with the investigation, a group it is currently in.

As an alternative to duties, exporters can commit to sell their products at or above a minimum price. Chinese exporters agreed such an undertaking in the case of solar panels a decade ago. However, cars are not commodities, so it is hard to see how a minimum price could be applied.

WHO DECIDES?

At the provisional stage, the Commission has full power to impose duties, although it does consult EU members and is supposed to take their positions into account. They are to submit their positions by July 15.

At the end of the investigation, the Commission can then propose definitive duties, normally applying for five years.

It can be blocked if a qualified majority of the European Union's 27 members oppose measures. A qualified majority means 15 EU members representing 65% of the EU population. In most cases, there is no blocking majority.

WHAT HAPPENS AFTER THE INVESTIGATION?

Any company not in the sample group of BYD (SZ: ), Geely and SAIC that wishes to have its own individual duty can ask for an ""accelerated review"" just after the imposition of definitive measures. Such a review should last a maximum of nine months.

The Commission can also carry out an ""interim review"" after a year has elapsed if the measures are no longer necessary or if they are not sufficient to counteract subsidies.

The Commission itself often looks into whether producers are evading duties via exports of parts for assembly elsewhere. For the EU, such circumvention exists if 60% or more of the value of parts are imported from the country subject to duties and if the value added in the assembly is no more than 25%.

Companies can challenge the measures at the European Court of Justice. China can take the European Union to the World Trade Organization. Both legal paths can take well over a year.","WHAT ARE PROVISIONAL MEASURES?

The move is intended to help the TikTok owner secure a steady supply of AI chips, especially in the face of strict U.S. restrictions on chip exports to China, the report said.

The 5 nanometre chip will be compliant with U.S. export curbs and is likely to be outsourced for manufacturing to TSMC (NYSE: ), the world’s biggest contract chipmaker.

Bytedance and Broadcom already have partnerships in place, with the TikTok owner having purchased several AI-linked chips from the firm over at least the past two years.

A deepening of their partnership represents more efforts by Chinese technology firms to secure the supply of advanced AI chips, after the U.S. blocked several major chipmakers, most notably NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ: ), from selling their most advanced AI technology to China.

While Nvidia is still allowed to sell less advanced AI chips in China, the offerings have so far been met with a largely lukewarm response, especially when compared to offerings from local competitors such as Huawei.

This follows a broad push into generative AI over the past year, sparked by applications such as OpenAI’s Chat GPT. Bytedance is also reportedly working on its own genAI platform.

AI has served as a major source of demand for global chipmaking firms.

This follows a broad push into generative AI over the past year, sparked by applications such as OpenAI’s Chat GPT.","['chips', 'supply', 'investingcom', 'broadcom', 'working', 'technology', 'chinas', 'secure', 'advanced', 'chip', 'past', 'ai', 'tiktok', 'bytedance']",https://i-invdn-com.investing.com/news/Broadcom_800x533_L_1653567341.jpg,investingcom chines technolog firm byted work us chipmak broadcom inc nasdaq develop advanc artifici intellig processor reuter report monday move intend help tiktok owner secur steadi suppli ai chip especi face strict us restrict chip export china report said nanometr chip compliant us export curb like outsourc manufactur tsmc nyse world 's biggest contract chipmak byted broadcom alreadi partnership place tiktok owner purchas sever ailink chip firm least past two year deepen partnership repres effort chines technolog firm secur suppli advanc ai chip us block sever major chipmak notabl nvidia corpor nasdaq sell advanc ai technolog china nvidia still allow sell less advanc ai chip china offer far met larg lukewarm respons especi compar offer local competitor huawei follow broad push generat ai past year spark applic openai 's chat gpt byted also report work genai platform ai serv major sourc demand global chipmak firm broadcom earlier year hike annual earn forecast prospect improv aifuel demand

The deficit is forecast to widen to 2.5% of GDP this year from 1.7% in 2023 as cost-of-living measures and falling commodity prices hit the budget bottom line, the multinational lender said in its Indonesia Economic Prospects report.""The fiscal stance expanded slightly amid rising social spending and subsiding commodity windfalls,"" it said.

The deficit is then expected to hold at 2.5% of GDP in 2025 as Prabowo begins implementing his campaign promises, before narrowing slightly to 2.4% in 2026.Southeast Asia's largest economy has laws mandating that the annual budget deficit cannot exceed 3% of GDP, and setting a maximum debt-to-GDP ratio of 60% of GDP.

Concerns about the impact of Prabowo's policies on the deficit and debt ratios have added to the pressure on the rupiah and bond yields in recent weeks. Prabowo's aides have repeatedly said he would abide by the fiscal rules.

His flagship program of giving students free, nutritious meals will cost 450 trillion rupiah ($27.35 billion), equal to about 2% of the value of GDP, when fully implemented, according to the president-elect's team.""Because these (social programs) are important and can further boost human capital in Indonesia, there is a need to ensure their sustainability going forward,"" Wael Mansour, a senior economist at the World Bank, said in a media briefing.

""Hence, it is important to implement them gradually and within a fiscally sound way.""

The forecasts assumed Prabowo, who starts his five-year term in October, would implement the meals policy gradually and complement it with reforms that could boost tax receipts by 1% to 1.5% of the value of GDP annually.

Revenue reforms could include lowering tax thresholds, removing exemptions and improving audits, the report said.

The World Bank cautioned that global economic uncertainties remained a risk to the country's external balance and fiscal positions.

""External shocks such as a potential intensification of armed conflicts or geopolitical uncertainty could result in a sharper-than-expected decline in the terms of trade, resulting in lower revenues and a tighter fiscal and external position,"" it said.

The World Bank forecast economic growth would be 5.0% in 2024, compared with 5.05% in 2023, and then rise to 5.1% for both 2025 and 2026.

Prabowo, who is currently Indonesia's defence minister, has pledged to boost growth to 8% within his term.

The World Bank estimated Indonesia's current account deficit relative to GDP would progressively widen to 0.9% in 2024, 1.4% in 2025 and 1.6% in 2026, from 0.1% last year.

Indonesia's trade surplus has already narrowed this year, with lower commodity prices reducing export receipts.

Chinese stocks were nursing steep losses over the past two weeks, with sentiment towards the country and broader Asia remaining negative. Losses in Hong Kong were also driven by declines in heavyweight technology stocks.

Weak data from the country had also dented sentiment last week.

HONG KONG (Reuters) -A Hong Kong court on Monday adjourned a hearing into a petition seeking liquidation of Kaisa Group until Aug. 12, giving the embattled Chinese developer some respite as it works on its debt restructuring plan.

The Shenzhen-based developer has been working to restructure its offshore debt for two years after defaulting on $12 billion in offshore debt in late 2021.

""There are seven members in the AHG and it takes time to pin down final small details,"" Kaisa group senior advisor LL Tam said on Monday after the hearing, referring to the ad hoc bondholders group. The developer hopes to sign an agreement within the next fortnight, he said.

Justice Peter Ng told the court Kaisa ""really has no excuse if (there is) no progress"".

Citicorp International, the trustee of a major group of bondholders, has been acting as petitioner since March after a former petitioner withdrew.

Kaisa is China's second-largest issuer of offshore debt among property developers after China Evergrande (HK: ) Group and was the first Chinese property developer to default on its U.S. dollar bonds in 2015.

China Evergrande was ordered to liquidate by a Hong Kong court earlier this year and a growing list of companies in the sector, including Country Garden, are fighting against liquidation petitions filed by creditors.

Kaisa Chairman Kwok Ying Shing returned to mainland China from Hong Kong for the first time in almost a decade to get regulatory approval for an offshore debt restructuring, Reuters reported last week.

Kwok travelled to Shenzhen for talks with a government committee and onshore regulators about two months ago and is still there, sources said.

China has repeatedly called on the EU to cancel its tariffs, expressing a willingness to negotiate. Beijing does not want to be embroiled in another tariff war, still stung by U.S. tariffs on its goods imposed by the Trump administration, but says it would take all steps to protect Chinese firms should one happen.

Both sides agreed to start tariff talks after a call between EU Commissioner Valdis Dombrovskis and Chinese Commerce Minister Wang Wentao on Saturday during a visit to China by Germany's economy minister, who said the doors for discussion are ""open"".

TOKYO (Reuters) -Japan is always ready to take action against excessive market moves, Tokyo's top currency diplomat Masato Kanda said on Monday, as the yen fell close to 160 to the dollar, raising market caution about the prospect of fresh intervention.

""We won't comment on day-to-day currency moves as such comments could give the market unforeseen effects, but we are always to ready to take appropriate action when there are excessive moves,"" Kanda told reporters.

Japanese Finance Minister Shunichi Suzuki echoed Kanda in warning against excessive moves, saying that Tokyo ""would want to respond appropriately as needed.""

Suzuki declined to comment on whether he considered current market moves as excessive, but stressed that it was desirable for currency moves to be stable and reflect fundamentals.

The yen has been under pressure after the Bank of Japan's decision this month to hold off reducing bond-buying stimulus until its July meeting. The dollar traded at 159.87 yen early Monday.

Kanda, vice finance minister for international affairs, said he was aware the yen's decline towards 160 to the dollar has heightened market caution about intervention but noted authorities have no specific levels in mind on when to intervene.

The market widely sees 160 yen to the dollar as authorities' line in the sand. Japan spent some 9.8 trillion yen ($61.64 billion) to pull the currency out of a 34-year trough of 160.245 per dollar hit on April 29.

The steps, however, have failed to reverse the yen's weakness due partly to wide Japan-U.S. interest rate differentials.

Kanda also said the addition of Japan to the U.S. Treasury's foreign exchange manipulation monitoring list had ""absolutely no impact"" on Tokyo's policy options.

A U.S. Treasury report issued on Thursday added Japan to its foreign exchange monitoring list alongside six countries that were on the previous list.

""Japan has policy leeway to ensure that foreign exchange rates move in a stable manner reflecting fundamentals,"" Kanda said.

Issues emerge with currency intervention when a country tries to weaken its currency to boost exports, but ""what we are doing is exactly the opposite to that,"" he added.

""We will firmly respond to moves that are too rapid or driven by speculators,"" he said. ""If no action is taken to such moves, people, companies and households would suffer.""","""We won't comment on day-to-day currency moves as such comments could give the market unforeseen effects, but we are always to ready to take appropriate action when there are excessive moves,"" Kanda told reporters.

TOKYO (Reuters) -The Bank of Japan debated in June the chance of a near-term interest rate hike with one policymaker calling for an increase without delay to address risks of inflation overshooting expectations, a meeting summary showed on Monday.

The discussion highlights the board's growing awareness over heightening inflationary pressure in the world's third-largest economy, which could prod the BOJ to debate raising interest rates as early as its next policy meeting on July 30-31.

The yen's recent declines have heightened the possibility of an upward revision to the BOJ's inflation forecasts, which means the appropriate level of its policy rate could move higher, one member was quoted as saying at the June 13-14 policy meeting.

""The BOJ must continue to closely monitor data leading up to the next policy meeting"" in July, as upside risks to prices have become ""more noticeable,"" said another opinion. ""If deemed appropriate, the BOJ should raise its policy rate without too much delay.""

The central bank must consider whether further rate hikes are needed as inflation could exceed its forecasts if companies renew efforts to pass on recent rising costs, a third opinion said.

Some in the nine-member board, however, were more cautious about an imminent rate hike, citing the need to scrutinise whether rising wages will lift consumption out of the doldrums, the summary showed.

At the June meeting, the BOJ kept short-term rates intact at a range of 0-0.1% but decided to announce a detailed plan next month on reducing its $5 trillion balance sheet in a sign it was moving steadily towards normalising monetary policy.

With inflation exceeding its 2% target for two years, the BOJ has also dropped hints it will raise short-term rates to levels that neither cool nor overheat the economy - seen by analysts as somewhere between 1-2%.

Many market participants expect the BOJ to raise rates again some time this year, though they are divided on whether the timing could come as early as July or later in the year.

Japan's core inflation hit 2.5% in May, accelerating from the previous month's 2.2% due largely to higher energy levies.

The weak yen complicates the BOJ's policy path. While it helps keep inflation above its 2% target, the boost it gives to imported goods prices has hurt consumption by pushing up households' living costs.

The dollar briefly hit 159.62 yen on Friday, not far from the 34-year trough of 160.245 hit on April 29 that prompted Japan to intervene in the market. It stood at 159.87 yen in Asia on Monday.

""Monetary policy is conducted based on the BOJ's assessment of trend inflation and wage developments, not on short-term developments in the foreign exchange market,"" one opinion showed, brushing aside a view held by some market players the bank could hike rates soon to slow the yen's declines.","The discussion highlights the board's growing awareness over heightening inflationary pressure in the world's third-largest economy, which could prod the BOJ to debate raising interest rates as early as its next policy meeting on July 30-31.

SINGAPORE (Reuters) - The dollar was steady on Monday as traders looked ahead to fresh clues on the U.S. inflation path that will likely influence interest rates, while talk from Japanese authorities did little to temper the yen's decline back the round number of 160.

The yen weakened to 159.94 per dollar in early trade on Monday, its lowest since April 29, when the yen touched a 34-year low of 160.245 leading to Japanese authorities spending some 9.8 trillion yen to support the currency.

It was last at 159.70 per dollar after Japan's top currency diplomat Masato Kanda said on Monday authorities will take appropriate steps if there is excessive foreign exchange movement, and that the addition of Japan to the U.S. Treasury's forex monitoring list would not restrict their action.

The yen has come under renewed pressure after the Bank of Japan's (BOJ) decision this month to hold off on reducing bond-buying stimulus until its July meeting.

A summary of opinions at the BOJ's June policy meeting on Monday showed some policymakers called for raising interest rates in a timely fashion as they saw a risk of inflation overshooting expectations.

""It's pretty remarkable despite expectations of further BOJ policy tightening dollar/yen continues to creep higher and is now back up to 160,"" said Carol Kong, currency strategist at Commonwealth Bank of Australia (OTC: ).

""I think unless the BOJ gives very hawkish hints on policy, which is unlikely, dollar/yen is unlikely to turn around sustainably.""

The , which measures the U.S. unit against six peers, was last at 105.84, hovering close to the nearly eight week high of 105.91 it touched last week.

The spotlight this week will be on the U.S. personal consumption expenditures (PCE) price index - the Federal Reserve's favoured gauge of inflation - due on Friday.

Economists polled by Reuters expect annual growth in the index to slow to 2.6% in May and a soft reading is likely to bolster bets on an interest rate cut as early as September, which futures currently price as a 65% prospect.

Evidence is cumulating that the U.S. economy is slowing down, Citi strategists said in a client note, saying softer demand makes a string of softer core inflation readings more likely.

""The combination of slowing activity, a loosening labour market and slower inflation readings make us increasingly confident that the Fed will begin reducing policy rates in September,"" Citi said.

The focus through the week will also be on geopolitics, with the first U.S. presidential debate on Thursday and the first round of voting in the French election at the weekend.

The euro, which has been under pressure since French President Emmanuel Macron called a snap election earlier this month, was little changed at $1.0693. The single currency is down 1.4% this month.

France's far right National Rally (RN) party and its allies were leading the first round of the country's elections with 35.5% of the vote, showed a poll published on Sunday.

Christopher Wong, currency strategist at OCBC, said the knee-jerk impact on the euro can vary but is likely to be skewed to the downside, unless the outcome surprises with President Macron's ensemble coalition winning a larger share.

In other currencies, sterling was flat at $1.2643. The Australian dollar was last at $0.6640 and the New Zealand dollar was little changed at $0.6113.","The yen weakened to 159.94 per dollar in early trade on Monday, its lowest since April 29, when the yen touched a 34-year low of 160.245 leading to Japanese authorities spending some 9.8 trillion yen to support the currency.

SYDNEY (Reuters) - Australia could impose billion dollar fines on big supermarket chains that fail to comply with an industry code of conduct, the federal government said on Monday as it seeks to address concerns that suppliers have been unfairly squeezed on pricing.

Grocers with more than A$5 billion ($3.3 billion) in annual revenue - currently Woolworths, Coles, Germany's ALDI and wholesaler Metcash - will be made to comply with the code of conduct that has until now been voluntary, the federal government said.

The move comes after a report by former competition minister Craig Emerson (NYSE: ) found the current code was ""failing to address the imbalance of bargaining power between supermarkets and their suppliers, including farmers"", the federal government said.

The supermarkets will face fines of up to 10% of annual turnover for breaches of the code which mainly covers dealings with suppliers. Woolworths reported Australian food sales of A$48 billion in 2023, Coles took A$37 billion and Metcash had A$10 billion. ALDI does not disclose its earnings.

""This is about getting a fair go for families and a fair go for farmers,"" a joint statement by Treasurer Jim Chalmers, agriculture minister Murray Watt and competition minister Andrew Leigh said.

The federal government will prioritise passing laws to make the code mandatory, it said in a separate statement.

The review is one of six government inquiries into the country's supermarket sector which commentators say is one of the most concentrated industries in the world. Woolworths and Coles, the No. 1 and No. 2 grocers, together sell two-thirds of all Australian groceries.

Representatives for Woolworths and Coles said their companies would consider the report's recommendations and the government's response and were committed to supporting a sustainable grocery sector.

An ALDI Australia spokesperson said the company supported making the code of conduct mandatory and was reviewing the final recommendations.

A representative for Metcash was not immediately available for comment.

The National Farmers Federation said the changes would make it easier for grocery suppliers to speak up when they believed a large customer was misusing its market power to drive wholesale prices lower.

""These changes should finally give the code the clout it needs to protect farmers,"" the federation's acting CEO, Charlie Thomas, said.

""To protect growers we need a code with strong enough deterrents to influence behavior in the supply chain.""

A separate inquiry into consumer pricing by the Australian Competition and Commission is due to report in February 2025.
